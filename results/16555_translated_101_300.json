    "content": "The lobby of the Lan Xin Hotel was about six or seven hundred square meters. One-third of it served as a reception area and registration counter for guests, while the other two-thirds was a simple restaurant. When Nian Bing arrived, he had taken a glance. The decor in the restaurant could only be described as too horrible to look at. The long wooden tables had long since revealed their natural wood grain, the long benches seemed like they could lose a leg at any moment, and the surrounding walls were even more dilapidated, with the paint peeling off. Could such a place even be called a restaurant? If not for the guest rooms being relatively clean and inexpensive, Nian Bing would never have chosen to stay here. However, the scene before him made him somewhat disbelieve his own eyes. It was just dusk, and a long queue had already formed at the restaurant's entrance. Inside the restaurant, it was already packed with people. At least a dozen waiters were busily bustling back and forth, creating a lively scene.\n\nA dilapidated place like this could have so many customers? Some of the customers were dressed quite splendidly. This could only prove one thing: this outwardly dilapidated restaurant must have a secret to its success, which was undoubtedly related to its food.\n\nWhat kind of delicious food could attract so many customers? Nian Bing's curiosity was immediately piqued. He walked to the counter in the lobby and asked the attendant behind it: \"Why are there so many customers in your restaurant! Is there anything good to eat here?\"\n\nThe attendant looked at Nian Bing's handsome face, a blush involuntarily rising on her cheeks. She said proudly: \"Sir, you must be from out of town. In our Bing Lan City, our Lan Xin Hotel's grilled chicken wings and the Staring Food Emporium's staring dish in the south of the city are collectively known as Bing Lan's two great famous dishes. Countless people come specifically for our Lan Xin Chicken Wings, drawn by their fame.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" The attendant's words piqued Nian Bing's interest. With such delicious chicken wings, he would have to try them today. Thinking this, he wasn't in a hurry. He quickly walked to the end of the long queue outside the restaurant and waited patiently.\n\nStepping out of the lobby, although he was at the very end of the queue, Nian Bing could see the scene in front of the restaurant just by turning sideways. The chicken wings were grilled to order. Waves of barbecue aroma constantly wafted over. Through observation, he noticed that the grilled chicken wings here did not include the drumette or wingtip sections, only the best mid-joint wings. Using this as the ingredient, it was no wonder they were famous in Bing Lan City. There were two chefs in charge of grilling, and their movements were very fast. They constantly flipped the mid-joint wings on the grill. Each skewer had one or two mid-joint wings, and each skewer used two bamboo sticks. This allowed the chicken wings to rest steadily on the grill while being cooked. From their flipping technique, Nian Bing didn't find anything special. He didn't believe that grilled chicken wings that could attract so many customers were merely this. He continued to observe patiently.\n\nFinally, through careful observation, Nian Bing discovered the secret of these Lan Xin Chicken Wings: the sauce. Whenever the chicken wings were almost done, the two chefs would take them off the charcoal grill. Behind the grill, they would brush a layer of sauce on them. When the sauced chicken wings were grilled again, they would emit a sweet and fragrant aroma. The chicken wings' color would also change from their original golden-yellow to brown. After a slight baking, they were done.\n\nThat's right, the secret must be in the sauce. This sauce must have been specially prepared using a unique process. Seeing this, Nian Bing's resolve to try it was solidified. He wasn't in a hurry and waited patiently in line.\n\nGrilling chicken wings takes time. When Nian Bing started queuing, there was still some afterglow of the setting sun in the sky. But by the time it was his turn, the sky had already become completely dark. Looking back at the still-long queue behind him, he couldn't help but sigh in his heart: \"For a business to reach this level, it's truly impressive.\"\n\n\"Sir, what kind of chicken wings would you like, and how many skewers? Will you be eating here or taking them away?\" The attendant in charge of collecting money politely asked Nian Bing.\n\nRecovering his thoughts, Nian Bing said: \"How many kinds of chicken wings do you have here? I'll have one skewer of each, and I'll eat them here.\"\n\nThe attendant replied: \"Alright, there are four kinds of chicken wings in total: Original, Mildly Spicy, Single-sided Spicy, and Double-sided Spicy. Are you sure you want one skewer of each? Our Mildly Spicy chicken wings sell the best here, and their flavor is quite balanced.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly: \"Of course. I've also come specifically for your reputation, so naturally, I want to try every kind. How much will it be?\"\n\nThe attendant gave Nian Bing a somewhat strange look, then smiled slightly: \"Our Lan Xin Restaurant has a rule: once you buy chicken wings, you must finish them, especially if you're dining in.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said: \"Alright, please make it quick. How much?\"\n\nThe attendant said: \"The chicken wings are three copper coins per skewer. Four skewers will be one silver coin and two copper coins in total. There's no seating inside right now, so please wait here for a moment.\"\n\nNian Bing paid and stood waiting to the side. Since he was at the front now, this time he clearly saw the sauce. In a cylindrical condiment container, there was a thick, dark brown liquid. The chefs used brushes to apply the liquid onto the almost-ready chicken wings.\n\nSmelling that somewhat strange sweet aroma, Nian Bing continuously guessed the true ingredients of the seasoning, but he still couldn't make a definitive judgment. It seemed he really had to taste it to confirm.\n\nFinally, Nian Bing's four skewers of chicken wings were ready. When the chicken wings were handed to Nian Bing, he was stunned. Only then did he fully understand what Single-sided Spicy and Double-sided Spicy meant. The Original chicken wings were simply the finished product brushed with sauce and grilled. Mildly Spicy meant a small amount of chili powder sprinkled on top of the Original. But Single-sided Spicy was already terrifying: one entire side of the chicken wing was completely covered in chili peppers. As for Double-sided Spicy, Nian Bing clearly saw that after the chicken wings were grilled, the chef rotated the entire skewer in a bag filled with chili peppers. Relying on the stickiness of the sauce on the chicken wings, almost every part of the chicken wings was completely covered in chili peppers. My heavens! Could this thing be eaten?\n\nSeeing Nian Bing's puzzled look, the attendant smiled: \"Sir, there are no seats available inside right now, so please eat standing for a moment. We have a rule here: if you can completely eat one skewer of Double-sided Spicy chicken wings, we will give you another skewer for free.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at the chicken wings in his hand, then took out the Original skewer and took a bite. Immediately, a rich sweet aroma filled his senses. It was indeed delicious, but while admiring it, Nian Bing also discovered a weakness in these chicken wings. Soon, one skewer of Original chicken wings was eaten. For Nian Bing to eat it so quickly, these chicken wings naturally had their unique qualities.\n\nWhen one skewer of chicken wings was finished, Nian Bing finally determined the ingredients of the sauce. No wonder it was so sweet and fragrant; it turned out there were at least six kinds of herbs in the sauce. Moreover, each herb complemented the others. Not only did they enhance the flavor, but they also had good warming and tonic effects on the human body. It truly had a unique characteristic.\n\nSmiling slightly, Nian Bing picked up the Mildly Spicy chicken wings and began to eat. There was a hint of spiciness within the sweet aroma, making him exclaim his enjoyment. No wonder the attendant mainly introduced this one just now; the taste was indeed delicious! If there wasn't an issue with the chef's technique, it could still reach a higher level.\n\nFinally, he picked up the Single-sided Spicy skewer, suddenly feeling somewhat terrified. He tentatively took a small bite. Upon first taste, there was no special sensation, and it wasn't even as spicy as the Mildly Spicy skewer he just had. However, the moment he was surprised, the chili's flavor erupted like a flame thrower, making him instantly open his mouth wide, as if fire could spew from his mouth. Nian Bing gasped heavily. My heavens! Is this thing meant for humans? It's so spicy!\n\n\"Water. Water...\" Nian Bing shouted loudly. The kind attendant suppressed her laughter and poured him a cup of tea.\n\nSweat streamed down his forehead. Nian Bing was sweating bullets inwardly! Just a small bite had almost made his snot and tears flow together. He immediately deduced that this insane chili was absolutely different from the one on the Mildly Spicy chicken wings; it was a very special kind of chili. Undeniably, it was indeed very fragrant, but the level of spiciness was something Nian Bing had never encountered. My heavens! My poor mouth. At this point, he seemed to feel his lips starting to swell. Was this food or poison?\n\nAfter a cup of tea, Nian Bing's stomach began to burn, not wanting to be outdone. The chili's power was truly extraordinary. Looking at the remaining chicken wings in his hand, he truly didn't have the courage to take a second bite. Not to mention the Double-sided Spicy one. He tentatively said to the attendant: \"I'm sorry, I really can't eat any more.\"\n\nThe attendant smiled slightly and said: \"I was just joking with you earlier. There's a seat over there now. Would you like a few more skewers of chicken wings? You can leave these for now.\"\n\nNian Bing breathed a sigh of relief. Led by the attendant, he sat down at a window seat. He said: \"Then please bring me a few more skewers of Original.\" Through tasting the chicken wings, his good impression of this Lan Xin Chicken Wings shop greatly increased. Not for anything else, but simply because those six kinds of herbs, although not very valuable, greatly increased the cost of the grilled chicken wings. The profit was much smaller than ordinary grilled chicken wings. To be so considerate of customers, the owner here was indeed a benevolent person.\n\nThe chili's power gradually subsided. Nian Bing truly wanted to try the taste of the Double-sided Spicy chicken wings, but he just couldn't muster the courage. Just then, outside, it happened to be the turn of two girls to buy chicken wings. One of the girls said: \"I heard you sell supreme chicken wings here. Give me a straight skewer of supreme.\"\n\nThe moment these words were spoken, both inside and outside the restaurant fell into complete silence. Everyone looked at the two ordinary-looking girls with eyes like they were seeing monsters.\n\n\"What are you looking at? Is there no supreme *[chicken wings]*? We've loved eating chili since we were little, and this time we came specifically to try them.\"\n\nThe attendant didn't say much. She nodded to the chef. In a short while, ten skewers of chicken wings were in the hands of the two girls.\n\nHolding the chicken wings, the two girls were completely stunned. One of them foolishly said: \"This, where are the chicken wings?\" What they called \"supreme\" was the Double-sided Spicy chicken wings! The chicken wings were completely covered by chili peppers; from the outside, you really couldn't see the chicken wings' presence. The moment she uttered these words, it immediately caused a burst of laughter throughout the room.\n\nThe attendant smiled slightly: \"The chicken wings are inside the chili. This chili is adhered when the sauce is thick. This is the supreme *[chicken wings]* you asked for! Please, two ladies, enjoy.\"\n\nThe girl on the left gritted her teeth and said: \"I don't believe this can be *that* spicy.\" As she spoke, she boldly took a large bite of the chicken wing.\n\nNian Bing watched the girl with wide eyes. He truly admired the girl's courage.\n\nWhat were the consequences of taking a large bite of the supreme chicken wings, Nian Bing soon saw. The girl cried, not out of sadness; tears and snot flowed uncontrollably. Her mouth wide open, she constantly exhaled, unable to utter a single word. Nian Bing clearly saw that her tongue seemed to be a bit swollen. He truly wondered if this girl would breathe fire.\n\nShaking his head in amusement, Nian Bing knew it was time for him to leave. He had fully figured out the secret of these chicken wings. However, before leaving, he wanted to do something for this restaurant. He walked up to the girl who was unbearably spicy, and his right hand condensed a piece of ice, which he put into her mouth. \"This should help. Don't be so impulsive in the future. The chili here is truly formidable.\"\n\nThe attendant looked at Nian Bing in surprise; she truly couldn't understand where that ice block came from. Nian Bing smiled brightly and said: \"Could you let me grill a few skewers of chicken wings myself? I'm willing to pay double the price.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the attendant's face immediately showed a look of caution. She shook her head and said: \"I'm sorry, our grilled chicken wings' sauce is a secret recipe, so outsiders are not allowed near it.\"\n\nNian Bing interrupted her, saying: \"Don't worry, I won't use your sauce.\" As he spoke, he walked over to the two chefs, picked up five raw skewers of chicken wings, and placed them on the charcoal fire.\n\nThe chef closest to Nian Bing frowned deeply. \"What are you doing?\"\n\nA gentle smile appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. He said: \"I want to show you how to make even better chicken wings.\"\n\nThe chef burst into laughter. \"A joke! Our Lan Xin Hotel's chicken wings are famous throughout the world, renowned as the best chicken wings under heaven. Do we need you to teach us?\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly: \"Yelang's arrogance<sup>1</sup> will make your craftsmanship regress. Although the chili is supreme, it overshadows the chicken wings' original flavor. Since you consider yourselves the best under heaven, why not let me try? And let the customers here be the judges. If you lose, I want nothing. If I lose, I am willing to pay the price of one purple gold coin. How about that?\"\n\nThe chef said angrily: \"Are you here to cause trouble?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said: \"No, I told you, I'm here to teach you how to grill chicken wings.\" He glanced at the chicken wings the other chef was grilling on the charcoal grill, then smiled calmly and said: \"Chicken wings aren't grilled this way. Watch carefully; I'll only do it once.\"\n***\n<sup>1</sup> Yelang's arrogance: An idiom referring to a small ancient kingdom, Yelang, which was so isolated that it believed itself to be the largest and most powerful in the world. It is used to describe someone who is conceited or overestimates their own abilities due to ignorance or isolation.",

    "content": "While speaking, Nian Bing's right hand grabbed the chicken wings that had begun to heat up on the charcoal and quickly rotated them. Each side of the chicken wings stayed on the charcoal for no more than a second. The two chefs stopped their work and watched him with cold smiles, wanting to see how Nian Bing would make a fool of himself.\n\nNian Bing's movements were very simple, something any ordinary person could do. But the difficulty lay in the rhythm of the rotation. From beginning to end, his speed remained consistent, without the slightest change. The two chefs grilling chicken wings were not incompetent either; soon, their initial disdain vanished, replaced by a look of solemnity.\n\nNian Bing's movements were relaxed. When the chicken wings' surface color began to turn yellow, his movements changed. Five skewers of chicken wings were laid flat on the charcoal, and he began to flip them one by one, continuously cycling from left to right. The rhythm remained stable, and the time each chicken wing was grilled on one side on the charcoal was slightly longer than before.\n\nThe chef closer to Nian Bing asked doubtfully, \"Even if your movements are more skilled and you can grill the chicken wings more evenly, the taste won't be much different from ours. Unless one is a true gourmet, it's impossible to taste that subtle difference. Besides, this is very tiring. Do you know how much we sell in a day here?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, and while grilling the chicken wings, he said, \"It's not as you imagine; the real key hasn't even begun yet. You can rest assured, I will absolutely not use your sauce. Just a little salt and cumin will be enough.\"\n\nSoon, the difference between Nian Bing's grilled chicken wings and the two chefs' became apparent. When the two chefs grilled, after the chicken wings turned yellow, they would start brushing on some oil to make the chicken wings more fragrant and tender. Nian Bing, however, did not do this; he merely sped up his flipping. With a faint smile, a subtle divine light gleamed in Nian Bing's eyes. The critical moment had arrived.\n\nWhen the chicken wings turned golden-yellow and began to emit a fragrant aroma, Ghost Carve* leaped into his hand without warning. Nian Bing swiftly cut three horizontal and three vertical slits, six openings in total, on one side of the chicken wing. His movements were fluid and seamless, without any pause. Everyone only saw a blue light flash across the chicken wings. The chicken wing was already flipped, and the same action appeared once again on the other side of the chicken wing. Ghost Carve* disappeared, and Nian Bing continued to flip the chicken wings.\n\n\"Did you see clearly? The chicken wing's own fat is the most abundant part of the chicken wing; there's no need to brush on extra oil at all. When the chicken wings turn golden, make a few cuts on them. This way, the chicken wings' own fat can fully permeate into the chicken, making the chicken meat's flavor more even and the chicken wings more flavorful.\" Saying this, he grabbed a handful of cumin and evenly sprinkled it on both sides of the chicken wings. When the chicken wings were flipped over once more, he sprinkled salt on them and continued grilling.\n\n\"Grilling chicken wings actually doesn't require too many added ingredients, because the chicken wings' own flavor is already excellent. While your sauce can make the chicken wings taste rich and fragrant, it only emphasizes sweetness. The entire chicken wing tastes like sauce, losing the chicken wing's inherent aroma and the crispy, charred aroma of its skin. Although adding beneficial herbs to the sauce is commendable, as a chef, flavor is still the most important. Alright. Please taste my supreme chicken wings.\" The chicken wings rose from the grill. Nian Bing handed two skewers each to the two chefs, gave one of the remaining three skewers to the waiter, and the other two to the customers at the very front of the line.\n\nA purple-gold coin* flew from Nian Bing's hand, landing on the counter in front of the waiter. He pushed through the crowd and strode away.\n\nBooing erupted as Nian Bing left; over eighty percent of the customers believed he had conceded. Nian Bing didn't care about such empty reputation. He walked down the main street, heading towards the brightly lit thoroughfare.\n\n\"Wow, this is truly delicious, so fragrant! I've never eaten such fragrant chicken wings before,\" exclaimed a fortunate customer who had received a chicken wing.\n\nAt this moment, the two chefs from Lan Xin Restaurant* were in a daze. The aroma that emerged when the chicken wing entered their mouths, though not a sweet fragrance, perfectly embodied the chicken wing's own inherent flavor. Coupled with the crispy, charred skin and the delicate, tender chicken meat, it was, as Nian Bing said, truly supreme grilled chicken wings! The two chefs exchanged glances. One of them said, \"Sorry, dear customers, we have decided to temporarily close for business today. Tomorrow, we will launch new grilled chicken wings.\" After speaking, the two immediately walked towards the back kitchen. The only thing they needed to do now was meticulously record every action Nian Bing had just performed. Nian Bing's culinary skills had completely conquered them.\n\nAll of this was already within Nian Bing's expectations. His actions were merely a gesture of appreciation for restaurants that sincerely treated their customers. He believed that as long as those two chefs weren't foolish, they would certainly learn many things from his actions, and the methods for grilling chicken wings would also increase in variety. He hoped their business would improve, after all, there were too few merchants nowadays who weren't purely profit-driven.\n\nAs he walked, he suddenly saw a restaurant not far ahead. He hadn't been full from the earlier chicken wings, and instead, they were so spicy he almost cried. His stomach was now starting to protest. The reason that restaurant attracted Nian Bing was its signboard. The signboard was very simple, with only four large characters: First-Grade Noodles*.\n\nFirst-Grade? To dare to call itself \"First-Grade\" showed that the owner of this establishment had absolute confidence in their food. He had to go in and see. When it came to noodle dishes, there were many intricacies, and Nian Bing was least skilled in noodle making.\n\nThe business of First-Grade Noodles was a world apart compared to Lan Xin Restaurant. There were only a few tables of guests, and most of them had only a bowl of noodles in front of them.\n\n\"Sir, you've arrived. What would you like to eat?\" A waiter politely came forward to greet him.\n\nNian Bing walked to a table and sat down, smiling faintly, \"What are you best at here?\"\n\nThe waiter smiled and said, \"Noodles, of course. We have all kinds of noodle dishes here; there's nothing you can't imagine that we can't make. However, our prices are relatively higher here. The price for any noodle dish is one gold coin.\"\n\n\"What? One gold coin? You might as well just rob people!\" Nian Bing widened his eyes and looked at the waiter. One should know, one gold coin was enough for a decent banquet, yet here it only bought a bowl of noodles. No wonder there were so few customers. However, Nian Bing quickly noticed a problem: most of the customers in the restaurant were elderly, and all of them were splendidly dressed. When he cried out in surprise, their gazes towards him were full of disdain.\n\nThe smile vanished from the waiter's face. \"As the saying goes, 'A woman adorns herself for the one who delights her; a scholar dies for the one who knows him.'* Sir, since you question our prices, you may leave now. We do not welcome customers like you.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment. Doing business, and yet they chased customers away? This First-Grade Noodles was indeed strange. He decided he had to taste what was so special about this place. A faint smile appeared on his face. He said, \"I'm sorry, I was rude just now. I just didn't expect the noodle prices here to be so high.\"\n\nThe waiter looked at Nian Bing with some surprise. Clearly, he hadn't expected Nian Bing to decide to stay, especially after he had already apologized. What else could he say? He could only say, \"Then, sir, what would you like to eat? You may choose any noodle dish here.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"Then I'll have three kinds: five Golden Fragrance Rings*, five Donkey Rolling*, and a plate of Ginger Juice Fried Dough Twists*. Please make it quick, thank you.\"\n\nUpon hearing Nian Bing order these three dishes, the waiter's face immediately showed surprise. He had worked here for a long time and naturally knew which noodle dishes were difficult to make. Of the three noodle dishes Nian Bing ordered, he had only heard of Golden Fragrance Rings; the other two he hadn't even heard of. A hesitant glint appeared in his eyes. He said, \"I'm sorry, sir. Would you mind paying first?\"\n\nNian Bing took out three gold coins from his pocket and handed them to him, saying, \"Now is that alright?\"\n\nThe waiter nodded and said, \"Please wait a moment, it will be ready soon.\"\n\nThe waiter left. Nian Bing looked around. The restaurant's decor was rather rustic; the floor was covered with brown wooden planks, and all the tables and chairs were made of wood. The entire restaurant looked very clean. In the innermost part, there was a calligraphy piece with the two characters \"First-Grade\" written on it. The calligraphy was strong and vigorous, exuding an impressive aura.\n\nThe three noodle dishes Nian Bing chose were specialty snacks from different parts of the continent. Cha Ji* had once told him, when teaching him culinary skills, that if he could master these three noodle dishes, his noodle-making skills could essentially be considered proficient. These three different noodle dishes were the ultimate test of a pastry chef's skill.\n\n\"Hey, is anyone here? I'm starving, give me a bowl of noodles!\" A clear voice rang out, drawing the diners' gazes towards the entrance. Upon hearing this voice, Nian Bing's entire body trembled. When he saw the red figure standing at the doorway, he couldn't help but secretly groan and quickly lowered his head. However, his seat was very close to the entrance, and coupled with his golden hair, which was extremely rare in the Ice Moon Empire*, it immediately attracted the attention of the newcomer.\n\nA voice of surprise rang out, \"Nian Bing, this is great, I finally found you! It seems my luck is really good.\" The person who suddenly appeared at the doorway was none other than the Eldest Young Lady of Clear Wind Chamber*, Xue Jing. From her travel-weary* appearance, it was clear she had rushed all the way. Her red warrior's attire accentuated her perfectly curved figure, and though she looked somewhat tired, it did not diminish her heroic spirit in the slightest.\n\nSince he had already been recognized, Nian Bing, helpless, had no choice but to stand up and go to greet her. \"Jing Jing, why did you come all the way here?\"\n\nXue Jing's mood brightened upon seeing Nian Bing. She smiled and said, \"Wasn't it to find you? You left without saying a word! If Ling'er* hadn't told me, I wouldn't have known you really left just like that. You're really heartless!\"\n\nFeeling the strange glances from the diners, who seemed to be wondering, \"Could such a beautiful girl also be abandoned?\"\n\nNian Bing couldn't help but feel a wave of awkwardness and smiled wryly, \"My dear lady*, please watch your words. We're just ordinary friends, don't make it sound like a resentful woman*.\"\n\n\"Hmph!\" Xue Jing's pretty face flushed, and she said irritably, \"Who's a resentful woman? You wish! I'm here to drag you back. Just leaving like that... if you don't come back to Clear Wind Chamber with me, I'll follow you forever and annoy you every single day.\" Her voice was loud, and some diners already had smiles on their faces.\n\nNian Bing pulled Xue Jing to his current table and made her sit down. \"Miss, I'm not deaf; I can hear you even if you speak softer.\"\n\nXue Jing suddenly had red eyes and said, aggrieved, \"I really didn't expect you would just leave like that. Am I really that annoying to you?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said softly, \"No, don't misunderstand. My departure from Ice Snow City* was also out of necessity! I thought that soon after I left, a royal decree from Ice Snow City would come to summon me. I don't want to lose my freedom, especially since my lifelong ambition has always been to travel across the continent and gather the strengths of various culinary schools. Didn't I explain it clearly to you back then?\"\n\nXue Jing snorted and said, \"I don't care. Anyway, if you don't come back with me, I'll travel the continent with you. I happen to want to explore more too.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled wryly, \"How can that be? You're a girl, following a man like me every day; people will gossip. Aren't you afraid your Yan Feng* will get jealous?\"\n\nA strange glint appeared in Xue Jing's eyes. \"Nian Bing, tell me honestly, do you really dislike me?\" Her voice was calm, but the light in her eyes showed that she was serious now.\n\nNian Bing paused, and said, \"Initially, I did dislike your temper somewhat. However, I later found that although you have a strong temper, you are lively, cheerful, and kind-hearted; you are truly a good girl.\"\n\nXue Jing sighed in relief and whispered, \"Actually, I've always known that my reputation as a 'madwoman'* isn't good. When you left Ice Snow City, I'm afraid a large part of the reason was to avoid me, wasn't it?\"\n\nNian Bing said helplessly, \"Why do you always say that? I've said many times that my departure from Ice Snow City was entirely for my own reasons, and had nothing to do with you. We are already friends, so why would I dwell on past matters?\"\n\nXue Jing smiled. \"You said it! Since that's the case, then let me travel the continent with you. When the fuss in Ice Snow City dies down, you can come back with me to be a chef, or we can just find a random place to open a restaurant. I'll put up the money, and you'll be the major shareholder. How about it? I'll let you have half the shares, and everything in the kitchen will be up to you.\"\n\n---\n* **Ghost Carve**: Likely a named kitchen tool or knife used by Nian Bing.\n* **purple-gold coin**: A unit of currency in this setting.\n* **Lan Xin Restaurant**: The name of a restaurant.\n* **First-Grade Noodles**: The name of a noodle restaurant, implying supreme quality.\n* **'A woman adorns herself for the one who delights her; a scholar dies for the one who knows him.'**: A classical Chinese saying emphasizing the importance of appreciation and understanding.\n* **Golden Fragrance Rings**: A type of sweet pastry.\n* **Donkey Rolling**: A traditional Beijing snack made of glutinous rice flour, bean paste, and soybean flour.\n* **Ginger Juice Fried Dough Twists**: A crispy fried snack often flavored with ginger.\n* **Cha Ji**: A person's name.\n* **Ice Moon Empire**: The name of an empire.\n* **Clear Wind Chamber**: An organization's name.\n* **travel-weary**: An idiom meaning exhausted from traveling.\n* **Ling'er**: A person's name.\n* **My dear lady**: A colloquial term of exasperated address for a young woman; here conveying Nian Bing's frustration.\n* **resentful woman**: Implies a woman left by her lover, often used in a slightly derogatory or dramatic sense.\n* **Ice Snow City**: The name of a city.\n* **Yan Feng**: A person's name.\n* **madwoman**: A colloquial term used to describe someone with a wild or unruly personality, in this context self-deprecating.",

    "content": "Nianbing's heart involuntarily contracted upon hearing this. Frankly, the main reason he left Ice Snow City was indeed because of himself, but there was another reason: to avoid those extremely attractive beauties. He knew that while beauties were good, they could cause his will to falter. He never imagined Xue Jing would chase him out and even want to travel the continent with him. How could he agree to that?\n\n\"Jingjing, don't be like this. My master once told me that my culinary skills are already good enough to graduate, but I still need more comprehension to reach the pinnacle of culinary arts. So, I need to travel the continent for at least seven or eight more years. You can't just keep following me!\"\n\nXue Jing smiled and said, \"Why not? Anyway, you can't shake me off. No matter how many years, I'll just follow you. If you think it's inconvenient, then just marry me. How about I 'humble' myself and marry you?\"\n\nNianbing was speechless. He was truly afraid of Xue Jing. He gave a wry smile and said, \"Don't joke around. How could I be worthy of you? Young lady, please let me go. Did Uncle Xue agree to you coming out to find me like this?\"\n\nXue Jing stuck out her tongue and said, \"What's there to not be worthy of? I think *you* feel I'm not worthy of *you*. I snuck out, but I left a letter for my dad.\"\n\nNianbing's heart secretly rejoiced. By this time, he had recovered from the shock of Xue Jing's sudden appearance. He immediately put on a sad expression and looked at Xue Jing without saying a word.\n\nXue Jing was taken aback for a moment and said, \"Nianbing, what's wrong?\"\n\nNianbing sighed softly and said, \"Jingjing, you've made a huge mistake! How could you run away from home? Uncle Xue only has one daughter, you. He's placed all his hopes on you. He's also over sixty today. As a child, you should be by his side, showing filial piety! Did you ever consider how worried Uncle Xue would be, sneaking out like this to find me?\"\n\nUpon hearing Nianbing mention her father, Xue Jing immediately lowered her head. Although she had a bad temper, she was very filial to her father. She whispered, \"I, I didn't want to either! But you suddenly left without a word, and I felt as if the entire Qingfeng Zhai was empty, so I decided to come out and find you. I think Dad will definitely forgive me.\"\n\nWithout needing to intentionally stir up emotions, upon thinking of his parents, genuine feelings immediately appeared on Nianbing's face. \"Jingjing, compared to me, you are far too fortunate. Do you know how much I want to be with my parents? But I can't. If my parents could be safe and sound, I would give up everything I have now just to stay by their side and show filial piety. How much I want to see Dad and Mom again! But that's impossible now.\" The sorrowful aura was so genuine; at this moment, he was no longer faking it. Thinking of his parents, a strong hatred for the Ice God Tower welled up in his heart.\n\nSensing the sorrowful aura emanating from Nianbing, Xue Jing was startled. \"Nianbing, what's wrong? Where are your parents? I've never heard you talk about your family.\"\n\nNianbing took a deep breath and said, \"I can't even confirm their lives or deaths. Although I know where they fell captive back then, I can't search for them now. Jingjing, do you know what kind of people I hate the most? Unfilial children. You have an old father at home now, yet you secretly left. How worried Uncle Xue must be! Listen to me, rest for a night in Binglan City today, and go back quickly tomorrow. Also, please send my regards to Uncle Xue. When I return from my travels across the continent, I will definitely visit you at Qingfeng Zhai.\"\n\nNianbing's voice was very sincere, but Xue Jing detected a hint of something off. Before deciding to leave Ice Snow City, she had gone to find Lu Rou. Otherwise, she wouldn't have known the direction Nianbing had gone. Lu Rou had told her that Nianbing was a very complex person, and if she were to look for him, she must be careful and absolutely not easily believe Nianbing's words.\n\nXue Jing thought for a moment and said, \"Nianbing, how about this: tomorrow, I'll first write a letter to my dad, telling him I'm safe and sound. Then, I'll go with you to the Orland Empire. Rou'er said you'd deliver a letter for her. Once you've delivered the letter, I'll go back, okay?\" A hint of tenderness appeared in her eyes; the \"madwoman\" demeanor had completely vanished. Although she didn't fully believe Nianbing's words, Nianbing had still moved her. Xue Jing's mother had passed away when she was very young, and she had always depended on her father, Xue Ji. He had acted as both father and mother, raising her with great difficulty. Her father-daughter bond with Xue Ji was extremely deep. Hearing Nianbing speak, her father-daughter affection welled up, and only then did she feel that her secretly leaving was inappropriate.\n\nLeave after delivering the letter in the Orland Empire? Was this true? Nianbing was a little skeptical, but since Xue Jing had already said so, he truly had no reason to refuse anymore. He could only nod helplessly and say, \"Alright then. But there's one thing I must state beforehand: you cannot cause me trouble on the road. Otherwise, I will absolutely not agree to you coming with me.\"\n\nXue Jing giggled and said, \"Don't worry, I'll listen to everything you say. That should be fine, right? I can even promise you I'll try my best to control my temper.\" While speaking, she was also making her own personal calculations. She had already determined Nianbing's place in her heart when she left Ice Snow City to chase him. She thought to herself, *Didn't you teach me that if you like someone, you should bravely pursue them? It will take at least fifteen to twenty days to travel from here to the Orland Empire. I don't believe you won't develop feelings for me over such a long time.* Xue Jing was still very confident in her figure and appearance. If she could get Nianbing to return with her, then all problems would be solved.\n\nJust then, a waiter walked out carrying trays. \"Sir, your food is ready.\" As he spoke, he placed the three plates one by one on the table.\n\nAs soon as Nianbing saw the food, his attention immediately shifted. He secretly exclaimed, \"How fast!\" Even if he were making these three dishes himself, he probably wouldn't be much faster than the chef here. A faint aroma wafted towards them; naturally, the Golden Fragrance Rings were the most fragrant.\n\nXue Jing said in surprise, \"Aren't these Golden Fragrance Rings? How are they sold here too?\"\n\nNianbing smiled slightly and said, \"Jingjing, let's try them and see how the chef here compares to Master Ming.\" As he spoke, he picked up a Golden Fragrance Ring with his chopsticks, brought it to his mouth, and took a bite. The moment the Golden Fragrance Ring entered his mouth, Nianbing was instantly moved. He looked at Xue Jing. Xue Jing was also looking at him at that moment.\n\n\"Nianbing, do you know who the chef here is? How come the Golden Fragrance Rings he made are the same as Uncle Ming's? Uncle Ming said that the secret of Golden Fragrance Rings is passed down through their single lineage; besides him and his master, only your master, Senior Ghost Chef, knows it. What's going on?\"\n\nNianbing shook his head and said, \"I don't know either. Try these two other dishes. Do you recognize these two kinds of flour-based snacks?\"\n\nXue Jing had been drawn to the Golden Fragrance Rings earlier and only now noticed the other two flour-based snacks. She shook her head blankly and said, \"Nianbing, what are these?\"\n\nNianbing pointed to the plate of food neatly stacked, yellow in appearance, resembling pastries, and said, \"This is Rolling Donkey, a very famous snack in the Huarong Empire. But it's very difficult to make well. I think you'll definitely love it. Try it.\"\n\nXue Jing picked up a Rolling Donkey, took a small bite, and after chewing a few times, a look of surprise immediately appeared on her face. \"Delicious, it's really delicious! What is this made of? It's fragrant and sweet, and a bit sticky. The taste is wonderful!\"\n\nNianbing also picked up a piece and ate it, saying as he ate, \"It's indeed good, authentic Rolling Donkey. The flavor is mastered very well. Actually, Rolling Donkey should be called 'bean cake,' because after it's made, it's rolled in soybean flour, like a real donkey rolling in the field, raising dust, hence its name. Its ingredients are yellow millet flour steamed with water, with a bit more water added to soften the dough. Separately, roasted soybeans are ground into flour. During preparation, the steamed yellow millet flour is coated with soybean flour, rolled into a sheet, then spread with red bean paste filling and rolled up. It's cut into small pieces, about two *liang* in weight, and sprinkled with white sugar. The preparation requires the filling to be evenly rolled, with clear layers, and a yellow exterior. Its characteristics are fragrance, sweetness, and stickiness, with a rich soybean flour aroma. Jingjing, look, the layers of this Rolling Donkey are very distinct, and there are many layers, each uniform in thickness. This is a top-grade Rolling Donkey, named Thousand-Layer Rolling Donkey. On the surface, it looks simple. In reality, because the bean dough itself is very soft after being mixed, it's absolutely not easy to control it as one wishes.\" After saying the last sentence, he stuffed the remaining Rolling Donkeys into his mouth and nodded contentedly. Finally, he could eat delicious food without having to make it himself.\n\nAfter eating one Rolling Donkey, Xue Jing didn't continue eating. Instead, she pointed to another plate and said, \"What about this one? It looks yellow and quite thin, seemingly like transparent thin crystal. It smells a bit like ginger.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly and said, \"This is Ginger Juice Fried Twists. Compared to Rolling Donkey, it's even more famous. It's a well-known snack from the southernmost Qilu Empire, generally preferred by children. Back then, my master personally went to the Qilu Empire to learn this snack, using all sorts of methods before finally obtaining the true teaching. Like the Golden Fragrance Rings, these Ginger Juice Fried Twists also have their own preparation rhyme, which goes: 'Crafted by skill, to entice little kids, crispy, sweet, fragrant, perfectly ginger-flavored, small and exquisite, showing extraordinary talent.' Among them, the most crucial character is 'crispy.' In the production process, as its name suggests, Ginger Juice Fried Twists include fresh ginger as an ingredient, thus earning its name from the distinct fresh ginger flavor when eaten. Fresh ginger needs to be peeled and minced finely. Flour is combined with a certain proportion of alum powder in a basin, and kneaded into a dough with cold water. Another method is to mix the dough with water, then put it through a noodle machine five or six times until it's a smooth, uniform thin sheet. Then, fine starch powder is sprinkled on the thin sheet, which is folded into a long strip. This is then cut with a knife into *paicha* strips, one *cun* wide and two *cun* long. Two small pieces are stacked together, cut three times lengthwise in the middle, then fanned out into single pieces, twisted, and fried in warm oil. The fried *paicha* are then sugared. The sugaring method involves peeling and finely slicing fresh ginger, boiling the ginger slices in water, then removing them. White sugar is added, and after it boils, maltose and osmanthus are added. After it boils again, it's moved to low heat, and the fried *paicha* are dipped in the osmanthus maltose syrup made from the ginger. After sugaring, the *paicha* become light yellow, characterized by being crispy, sweet, and fragrant, with a ginger flavor when eaten. This *paicha* doesn't even need to be eaten to tell it's excellent. Just by its appearance, I can only achieve this level under normal circumstances.\"\n\nXue Jing was naturally familiar with Nianbing's sentiments, and understood that \"normal circumstances\" meant without using magic. For these three flour-based snacks before them to receive such high praise from him, it was evident that the chef here was extraordinary.\n\n\"Clap, clap, clap.\" Applause suddenly rang out. A clear voice said, \"Good, I was wondering who could identify these three flour-based snacks! So it's an expert! A pleasure, a pleasure to meet you.\" Nianbing and Xue Jing looked in the direction of the voice, only to see a woman in a chef's uniform standing gracefully at the entrance of the back hall, looking at the two of them.\n\nSeeing this young woman, Nianbing and Xue Jing couldn't help but gasp. They had seen ugly people before, but never anything this ugly. In these past days, Nianbing had seen too many beauties, so suddenly seeing a peerlessly ugly woman was truly a bit hard to adjust to. The young woman's figure looked rather good, tall and curvaceously graceful. However, her face could only be described as terrifying: a hooked nose, unibrow, high cheekbones, small eyes, and the most frightening were the large, yellow buck teeth protruding from her mouth. Seeing her appearance, one would probably lose all appetite. It was truly unbearable to look at, absolutely unbearable! However, she was not without advantages. Perhaps because her appearance was so poor, her skin looked very fair. That fresh, dewy quality of her skin was very alluring if one didn't look at her face.\n\nStanding up, a flicker of pity passed through Nianbing's eyes. He walked up to the young woman and said, \"Are you the head chef here?\"\n\nThe young woman, with her small eyes, looked at Nianbing and nodded, \"That's right, I'm the head chef here, and also the only chef. Hearing your evaluation of my three flour-based snacks just now, I assume you are also an expert.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly and said, \"I wouldn't dare call myself an expert. I was attracted by this very signboard. It seems these three gold coins were indeed well spent. The three flour-based snacks you made had their cooking temperatures perfectly controlled, especially the Rolling Donkey. Although I believe I can also make this Thousand-Layer Rolling Donkey, I probably can't match your uniformity.\" His strongest culinary skills were knife work and various grand banquets. Although he had put in hard work on flour-based snacks, Nianbing inwardly admitted that without incorporating his Ice-Fire Magic into the snacks, it would be difficult to surpass the young woman before him. She didn't seem much older than him, yet at such a young age, her culinary skills had reached a superb level of mastery. Nianbing couldn't help but secretly admire her, thinking that she, like himself, must have also been guided by a famous master.",

    "content": "The young girl smiled slightly, and frankly, her smile was uglier than most people's cries, as she said: \"Every chef has something they excel at. I only make flour-based dishes. While the phrase 'First-Class Flour Dishes' might be a bit exaggerated, I believe what I make is worth a gold coin.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred, and he said: \"Might I ask if you know a senior named Wondrous Chef? The other two flour-based dishes are known to the outside world, but few people know the secret to this Golden Fragrance Ring.\"\n\nA flicker of surprise flashed in the girl's eyes, \"You can tell the origin of my culinary skills with a single glance. Who are you?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, and said: \"I am just an ordinary chef. I have a friend who is a disciple of Senior Wondrous Chef, so I have a slight understanding of the Wondrous Chef lineage's culinary skills. That's how I recognized your cooking.\"\n\nThe girl's entire body trembled, \"Do you... do you know Senior Brother Ming Yuan? But he's in Ice and Snow City!\"\n\nXue Jing's excited voice came from behind Nian Bing, \"Are you Uncle Ming Yuan's junior sister?\"\n\nSeeing Xue Jing's exquisite beauty, the girl couldn't help but lower her head in shame, saying: \"Yes, I am Master's last disciple. Master said Senior Brother has always been in Ice and Snow City.\"\n\nXue Jing's beautiful eyes shimmered, and as if thinking of something, she stepped forward and intimately took the girl's soft hand, saying: \"Come, let's sit over there and talk. You call Uncle Ming Yuan 'Senior Brother,' so it seems I'm a generation lower than you, hehe.\"\n\nWatching the two girls walk to the side and sit down, seemingly having forgotten him, Nian Bing couldn't help but reveal a helpless bitter smile. However, he was very curious about this girl who called herself Senior Brother Ming Yuan's junior sister. From her profound skill in flour-based dishes, she was definitely no less accomplished than Ming Yuan, who had dedicated himself to this art. Although his master said his talent was very high, because he had learned almost all culinary arts over the past eight years, he specialized in very few. But with the aid of magic, he could become a top chef. Yet Nian Bing understood that if he wanted to make breakthroughs in his cooking, he absolutely couldn't always rely on magic. He needed to undergo long periods of deep comprehension and improve in all aspects.\n\nWalking to a table and sitting down, he happened to hear Xue Jing ask the girl: \"My name is Xue Jing. Uncle Ming Yuan is our Clear Wind Pavilion's head chef. What's your name?\"\n\nExcitement showed in the girl's eyes, \"My name is Ming Hui. Are you from Clear Wind Pavilion? My master once told me to visit Senior Brother at Clear Wind Pavilion when I had time. How is Senior Brother now? Is he doing well?\"\n\nXue Jing nodded, saying: \"Uncle Ming is very well. He doesn't personally cook much anymore. But why have I never seen him make that 'Donkey Rolling on the Ground' and 'Ginger Juice Dough Ribs'? Could it be that he doesn't know how?\"\n\nMing Hui nodded, saying: \"Yes, Senior Brother probably doesn't know how. These two flour-based dishes were learned when Master took me on his travels outside, exchanging his own culinary skills for them. Master hasn't seen Senior Brother for many years. Traveling outside can broaden one's horizons greatly. For example, for these Ginger Juice Dough Ribs, local children have a nursery rhyme to praise it: 'Buy one bag, get one free, Qilu Dough Ribs, poured with ginger juice, big fried dough twists, broken dough ribs, ten kinds of brocade flowers, a big bag like crystal, sweet and crispy when bitten.' They are known as Qilu's two most famous snacks, along with the fried dough twists from the Qilu Empire.\"\n\nHearing this, Nian Bing couldn't help but ask: \"Then where is Senior Wondrous Chef now? I'd like to consult him much more.\"\n\nMing Hui smiled slightly. Her buck teeth seemed even more prominent, \"Master isn't here. After he left me to work here, he just left by himself. He said he wanted me to practice here for a few more years on my own. I don't know where he went.\"\n\nNian Bing said sincerely: \"Miss Ming Hui, your culinary skills are already very exquisite.\"\n\nMing Hui was a little shy, a blush appearing on her fair face. She shook her head, saying: \"Actually, no. Master said that although my talent is good, my memory is poor, so he didn't want me to learn all kinds of culinary arts simultaneously like Senior Brother. He said that if I did that, while I could still become a good chef, it would be very difficult to become a top culinary master on the continent. Instead, it would be better to only learn one type of culinary art; that way, the hope of becoming a top chef would be much greater. Therefore, I later chose flour-based dishes, which have no bloody aura. My goal is to become a top flour-based dish chef.\"\n\nOnly learning flour-based dishes? Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a little doubtful in his heart, but he very much agreed with Wondrous Chef's approach. Back then, Cha Ji once told him that if it weren't for him possessing both ice and fire magic, he would also have hoped for him to start by learning one type of culinary art, so he could first master one thing, and then continue to develop in other directions. Later, because incorporating magic into cooking could make food infinitely varied, Cha Ji decided to let him develop in all aspects simultaneously, gradually improving his culinary mastery through long periods of practice and personal comprehension.\n\nSmiling slightly, Nian Bing said: \"You are already a top flour-based dish chef. I think even Senior Wondrous Chef, when he was your age, probably didn't have your current level in making flour-based dishes. I have experienced Master Ming's culinary skills, but when it comes to flour-based dishes, aside from the Golden Fragrance Ring, his other skills probably can't compare to yours.\"\n\nHearing Nian Bing's praise, the blush on Ming Hui's face deepened a few shades, \"Big Brother, you flatter me. Actually, all of this is thanks to Master. Without his meticulous cultivation, I wouldn't be where I am today. Master taught me for twelve years. I started learning to knead dough with Master from the age of five. At fourteen, I traveled across the continent with Master, and through three years of tempering, Master summarized the essence of flour-based dishes from various regions and integrated it into my flour-based dish skills, which is how I achieved this much today. However, compared to truly good chefs, I am nothing. After all, I am just a flour-based dish chef.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head, saying: \"No, Miss Ming Hui, you are mistaken. Although you are just a flour-based dish chef, if you can do your best in this area and become the continent's number one flour-based dish chef, then your achievements will absolutely not be inferior to any other chef. You must have confidence in yourself. As a good chef, humility is essential, but you absolutely cannot be self-deprecating. If you want others to acknowledge you, you must first acknowledge yourself. Do you understand?\"\n\nMing Hui gazed deeply at Nian Bing, and after a moment, she suddenly smiled, \"Your words feel so warm, like my Master's. If Master saw you, he would probably be very happy too. You two would definitely get along.\" Saying this, she turned to Xue Jing, who was beside her, and asked: \"Sister Xue, a few days ago, I heard from passing merchants that a very formidable chef appeared in Ice and Snow City, and he's also a magician. He can integrate magic into his cooking, making the dishes have many special flavors. I wonder if it's true?\"\n\nXue Jing glanced at Nian Bing and smiled slightly: \"Of course it's true, and that chef once worked at our Clear Wind Pavilion.\" She and Nian Bing had no doubt about Ming Hui. After all, other things could be fake, but culinary skills absolutely could not be, especially such profound flour-based dish techniques.\n\nMing Hui said in surprise: \"Is that so? Are his culinary skills really as miraculous as those merchants say? I really want to see what effect magic combined with cooking would have. It's a pity I can't use magic, otherwise I would definitely try it too.\"\n\nXue Jing's smile became even brighter. \"It's not hard to find out if his culinary skills are as miraculous as the legends say; why don't you experience them yourself?\"\n\nMing Hui was startled, saying: \"Experience? But he's in Ice and Snow City. Do I have to go to Ice and Snow City to experience it? I really can't leave this place without someone here.\"\n\nXue Jing laughed: \"It's not complicated to experience it; you don't even need to leave the door here, because he's right here.\"\n\nMing Hui was clearly a bit slow-witted and still didn't understand her meaning. She looked at Xue Jing doubtfully. Xue Jing turned her gaze to Nian Bing and whispered: \"The one you're talking about, far off in the sky, is right before your eyes!\" Ming Hui's eyes widened as she looked at Nian Bing: \"You... you're the one from the legends?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled wryly: \"I'm not an antique; please don't use the word 'legend' to describe me. However, I am indeed the chef you mentioned who incorporates magic into cooking. You can call me Nian Bing.\"\n\nThe excitement in Ming Hui's eyes was undeniable. Just like when Nian Bing first met Ming Yuan, only chefs of their caliber would have such a special feeling when encountering a chef of at least the same level, as if they were meeting a family member. \"That's wonderful! Then I must experience it. Big Brother Nian Bing, would you come to the kitchen with me?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled: \"I also want to learn some flour-based dish techniques from you. Frankly speaking, when it comes to flour-based dishes, I'm definitely not as good as you.\"\n\nMing Hui proactively took Nian Bing's hand, having completely forgotten about the distinction between genders, and led him towards the kitchen. Because of Ming Hui's appearance, Xue Jing felt no trace of jealousy, and she followed the two into the kitchen with a smile. As the Clear Wind Pavilion's heir, how could she miss such a sparring match between top chefs?\n\nThe kitchen of First-Class Flour Dishes was very large, but empty. Just as Ming Hui had said, she was the only chef there; there wasn't even an assistant. The most striking thing in the kitchen was the massive kneading board. Its left side was covered with a clean cotton cloth; without even looking, Nian Bing knew that various dough blanks were definitely stored underneath.\n\n\"Ming Hui, what kind of flour-based dish are you best at? May I try some? I wasn't full from those pastries earlier.\" Nian Bing smiled as he made his request.\n\nMing Hui said: \"What I'm best at is beef noodles. Please give me your guidance, Big Brother Nian Bing.\" As she spoke, she opened the lid of the stove below and boiled a pot of clear water.\n\nBeef noodles, it sounded incredibly common. However, Nian Bing knew that the beef noodles Ming Hui made would absolutely not be simple. Just as he was thinking, he saw Ming Hui take a strip of dough from under the kneading board. The dough was cylindrical, about half a foot long and as thick as a woman's forearm. She looked at Nian Bing: \"Big Brother, what kind of noodles would you like? Thick, thin, wide, or flat? Please choose one.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled: \"Among noodles, thin noodles demand the most skill from a chef. I'll have the thin ones; they're also easier to digest. Noodles are categorized by thickness: 'Two Pillars,' 'Second Thin,' 'Thin,' 'Hair-thin,' and 'One Pot Silk.' I imagine the thin noodles you make will be even finer than 'One Pot Silk.' Please begin.\"\n\n\"Good.\" With that simple, single-word reply, Ming Hui's eyes instantly changed. Nian Bing was intimately familiar with that look; it was the perfect unification of focus and mental concentration. Her eyes were fixed on the dough on the kneading board. Her hands gently pushed it back and forth, slowly lengthening the dough. Nian Bing knew this was her feeling the dough's elasticity. If the elasticity differed, the method for making noodles would also be entirely different. Even with dough he had kneaded well himself, he still needed to fully feel it before production, otherwise, deviations could easily occur.\n\nXue Jing whispered: \"Nian Bing, will her beef noodles have some special seasoning? Is there a secret recipe?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head, saying: \"If it relies on special seasoning or a secret recipe, that absolutely cannot be called a top flour-based dish chef. I think she's making ordinary beef noodles. Just watch, it will definitely be different from the beef noodles you usually eat. From her technique, you can tell she's using the pulled noodle method. Only this method can make the noodles reach their finest degree. Its highest realm is when the pulled noodles are finished, there isn't a single break; it's entirely one continuous strand. Therefore, top-tier pulled noodles are also called 'One Strand Noodles' or 'Supreme Longevity Noodles.'\"\n\nAs Nian Bing was explaining to Xue Jing, Ming Hui moved. Her hands each grasped one end of the pulled dough, slowly lifting it. Her serious expression remained utterly concentrated, her gaze moving with the dough. At that moment, it was as if that piece of dough had merged with her body.\n\nIt began. Her movements were very slow. She pulled the dough outwards to both sides, and it continuously maintained its cylindrical shape. Suddenly, she forcefully flicked her hands downwards. The dough in her hands instantly lengthened, hitting the kneading board with a 'thud.' As the dough rebounded, she swiftly transferred the dough from her left hand to her right, while simultaneously passing her left hand through the loop of the dough, instantly stretching it. This was the process of one becoming two.\n\nMing Hui's movements began to quicken, becoming dazzlingly fast. The white dough in her hands seemed to come alive, constantly interlacing and folding. The originally cylindrical piece of dough quickly transformed into fine strands. Nian Bing kept counting. In just a short while, that piece of dough had already become four thousand and ninety-six strands. Nian Bing had also learned to pull noodles, and he asked himself, given such a small piece of dough, he could at most reach this level without breaking the strands. However, Ming Hui did not stop her movements. She merely slowed down from her previous speed. Her hands trembled slightly at the same time, as if she could no longer hold the dough in her hands. Yet, her hands trembled with a clear rhythm. The four thousand and ninety-six strands of noodles swayed subtly like threads with the trembling of her hands. Strand touched strand, and because the noodle strands were extremely fine, Ming Hui's trembling looked so breathtaking, as if these noodle strands could break at any moment.",

    "title": "Chapter 42: Seven Forbidden Hands and Five Divine Swords (Part 1)",
    "content": "Seeing this, Nian Bing couldn't help but exclaim inwardly, this must be the Noodle Quaking Method his master spoke of. Cha Ji had once mentioned to Nian Bing that among pulled noodles, there was a most profound technique called the Noodle Quaking Method, which even Cha Ji himself didn't know. Through the Noodle Quaking Method, with uniform force, the noodles continuously increase in toughness and extensibility through collisions. The Noodle Quaking Method couldn't be more suitable for thin noodles, but Nian Bing was a little worried: if the noodles were folded one more layer, would they break from being too thin when boiled in water?\n\nFinally, as the noodles' quaking continued until the moment the water in the iron pot boiled, Ming Hui suddenly left the chopping board. Her left hand pulled out like lightning, her right hand held high, letting the four thousand ninety-six strands of noodles hang completely in the air. Her left arm blocked the middle of the noodle strands, her right hand carrying the strands to receive them downwards. In the process of one stretch and one pull, eight thousand one hundred ninety-two noodles appeared, not a single one broken, a seemingly miraculous feat that left one awestruck.\n\nWith a gentle flick, the noodles returned to their length when they were four thousand ninety-six strands. Ming Hui's left hand released, her right hand swept, effortlessly guiding the noodles into the boiling water. The iron pot was very large, reaching over one meter in diameter. Ming Hui placed the noodles at the edge of the iron pot, then immediately picked up a pair of chopsticks, the tips of which parted to either side; she didn't pick up the noodles, but instead rapidly stirred the boiling water in the center of the iron pot. At this moment, her hand suddenly turned milky white, and amidst the rising steam, it was as transparent as a crystalline pearl. When water droplets condensed from the steam appeared on her hand, it reminded Nian Bing of a phrase Cha Ji once said: \"From the vast sea, the moon shines, pearls shed tears.\"\n\nThe stirring became faster and faster, the entire pot of water spun rapidly driven by that pair of chopsticks, and the noodles also pulsed within the rotation. The originally boiling water no longer bubbled due to the rapid stirring.\n\nNian Bing exclaimed, \"I understand! This is the Water-Breaking Noodle Preservation Method! It's truly amazing.\" Water-Breaking Noodle Preservation refers to stirring boiling water into a vortex, so that the entire pot of water, though reaching the boiling point, does not actually boil. This way, when cooking, food can be heated more evenly, and its shape will certainly not be affected by bubbles rising during boiling. The requirement for rotation is not difficult; any chef, with long-term practice, can stir a pot of water into a vortex with chopsticks. The difficulty lies in her stirring *boiling* water. Although her hand did not touch the water, the temperature above the boiling water would certainly not be low. This requires that the chef not be affected by the boiling water in any way, and their hand must remain steady, thus making this Water-Breaking Noodle Preservation Method extremely difficult.\n\nThe chopsticks suddenly left the water surface. The boiling water in the iron pot continued to spin rapidly due to inertia. Ming Hui picked up a large bowl and opened an iron bucket nearby. From it, she ladled out a pale yellow broth. The broth looked very translucent, without a trace of impurities inside. When it rested in the bowl, it was like a giant yellow crystal. This was the prepared beef broth.\n\nThe chopsticks darted into the pot like lightning. Ming Hui gently lifted, and all the noodles, without a single strand left behind, exited the boiling water and were placed into the bowl. The steaming noodles, upon being immersed in the beef broth, immediately filled the bowl halfway. The chopsticks in Ming Hui's hand cleverly guided the noodle strands to turn once clockwise within the beef broth, then immediately once counter-clockwise, before stopping. The slightly yellow noodles lay neatly at the bottom of the bowl. She took a large iron ladle, scooped a spoonful of hot noodle broth from the pot, and poured it over the top. Then she reached into the iron bucket, picking out a few meat strips as thin as paper and about an inch wide, and a few slices of white radish cooked in the beef broth, placing them on top of the noodles. Finally, she pinched a handful of cilantro, sprinkled it into the noodle broth, then set the bowl down and drizzled a few drops of bright red chili oil.\n\n\"Clear Broth Beef Noodles, please enjoy.\" A faint sweat had already appeared on Ming Hui's forehead. Her hands returned to their original flesh tone. She looked at Nian Bing, her eyes filled with confidence.\n\nNian Bing said no more. He nodded to her, took the chopsticks from Ming Hui's hand, and began to eat.\n\n\"I want some too, leave some for me! Hey, don't eat so fast!\" Xue Jing, dissatisfied, tried to snatch Nian Bing's noodles. Nian Bing was actually not eating fast at all; he had only eaten a few strands of noodles, a piece of beef strip, and taken a sip of broth.\n\nHe handed the chopsticks to Xue Jing and sighed lightly. His eyes filled with admiration as he looked at Ming Hui. \"I'm convinced. Since leaving my master, this is the first time I've sincerely admired a chef. Your beef noodles absolutely deserve the words 'Grade A Noodle Dish'.\"\n\nMing Hui's plain face flushed slightly. She said, \"Big Brother Nian Bing, you flatter me.\"\n\n\"Wow, truly delicious. I usually dislike noodles the most, but how can these noodles be so tasty! Ming Hui, why are your noodles so thin, yet not soft at all? Every single strand is so springy, and they taste wonderful when eaten. Moreover, the noodles don't stick together at all. And the meat, is this beef you cut? It tastes so good. The broth is good too; it should be beef bone broth, right? Hmm, no, beef bone broth doesn't seem this fresh! And the aroma is a bit strange. It's clearly the aroma of beef broth, but why do I have a special feeling?\" Xue Jing's usually refined eating manner had completely vanished. The beef noodles weren't hot, and besides the bit Nian Bing ate, the rest would quickly disappear into her stomach.\n\nMing Hui covered her mouth and chuckled softly. She said, \"Sister Xue Jing, eat slowly. If you want more, I'll make it for you again, no rush!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"It's already quite good that she could make out so much; she truly lives up to being the future successor of Clear Wind Temple. Ming Hui, let me describe the characteristics of your Clear Broth Beef Noodles. See if I'm correct.\" After a moment's contemplation, he continued, \"The beef noodles you made perfectly capture the essence of traditional beef noodles, fully embodying their characteristics of 'one clear, two white, three red, four green, five yellow'. 'One clear' means clear broth, 'two white' means white radish slices, 'three red' means red chili oil, 'four green' means green cilantro, and 'five yellow' means yellow noodles. The fresh, bright, and rich colors stimulate your appetite. Not only that, but you've also added your own innovations. The thinness of the noodles alone is something I cannot achieve. That Noodle Quaking Method is truly miraculous; to be able to pull the noodles so thin yet maintain a certain toughness, far thinner than Bird's Nest Noodles*, yet still have bite and not affect the texture. What I admire most is your Water-Breaking Noodle Preservation Method. Even my master doesn't know it. I think your right hand must have practiced some special skill to make it resistant to heat. However, under the steaming heat, just being heat-resistant isn't enough; without strong willpower, it would be absolutely impossible to maintain hand steadiness. It truly impresses me! The noodles are good noodles, and at the same time, the broth is good broth. Just as Jing'er said, your beef broth is made by simmering beef bones and the best beef with refined beef fat. However, it's not just that simple. In this beef broth, you've added at least three kinds of herbs. These herbs not only don't affect the taste of the beef broth, but instead fully bring out its umami flavor. At the same time, the herbs' own flavors also blend into the beef broth. After experiencing the umami of the beef broth, you immediately sense the aroma brought by the herbs. The two flavors perfectly combine to form this supreme beef broth. It's truly amazing! As for the beef, it wasn't simply sliced; it was its inherent form. The most delicious meat on a cow isn't the rib-eye from the chest, nor any other thick cut or tenderloin, but rather the beef short ribs from the rib cage. Truly the best choice! Combining these few elements, I dare say that throughout the entire continent, you absolutely won't find Clear Broth Beef Noodles surpassing yours. I'm convinced, completely convinced.\"\n\nMing Hui's eyes flashed with surprise. \"Big Brother, everything you said was absolutely correct, except for the names of the three herbs, everything else was spot on. You truly are amazing!\"\n\nXue Jing contentedly rubbed her stomach. She came up to the two of them, looking at Nian Bing with some doubt. \"The beef noodles are indeed very delicious, but is it really as complex as you say? Little Sister Ming Hui, don't be afraid to deflate his ego. Go ahead and deflate it, I support you. I think he must have said something wrong.\"\n\nMing Hui shook her head, saying, \"No, there wasn't a single mistake. Even if I were to say it, the most I could add would just be the names of those three herbs. Big Brother Nian Bing's culinary skills must be even greater than mine. Big Brother, it's your turn now. I'd like to see what your ice and fire culinary skills are like, may I?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"After eating your delicious Clear Broth Beef Noodles, how could I hold back my skills?\" As he said this, he couldn't help but glance at Xue Jing. She was truly the one who ate a lot. He hadn't even had time to eat more, and the bowl was already empty. Oh, my poor stomach!\n\nAlthough he thought this in his heart, Nian Bing's movements did not stop. He walked to the chopping board, thought for a moment, and quickly decided what he would make. First, he washed his hands, then lifted the cloth covering the dough, taking out a piece of dough exactly the same as Ming Hui's earlier. With a slight smile, he said, \"I've eaten your noodles, so as a reciprocation, I'll make a bowl of noodles for you too. Yours were Clear Broth Beef Noodles, and mine will be Supreme Cold Noodles. There aren't the ingredients I need here, so I'll just have to make do and use a trick.\" As he spoke, he began the kneading process. He knew that if he didn't use some special technique, Ming Hui would surely look down on him. He didn't want others to say he relied on magic to cook delicious dishes.\n\nThe dough quickly formed into a ball in Nian Bing's hands. His hands moved slowly, each motion full of strength. Gradually, his movements began to quicken. Each press would knead the dough into an indistinct shape. As his movements grew faster, Nian Bing's wrist, as if boneless, guided his palm in forward and backward kneading motions. His palm's shadow completely enveloped the dough; the dough itself was no longer visible. His palm's shadow was like a ball, completely protecting the dough within.\n\nMing Hui's eyes widened, and she gasped. \"This is the Muscle-Separating Bone-Dislocating Noodle Kneading Method! It actually exists.\"\n\nXue Jing asked in surprise, \"Muscle-separating, bone-dislocating? Did the joints between his hand and wrist dislocate?\"\n\nMing Hui shook her head, saying, \"No, it's not like that. This method of kneading is extremely difficult to master. The main reason lies in wrist flexibility. Only by training the wrist to twist in any direction can one possibly succeed, just as if the muscles and bones were dislocated. This kneading method also has another name, the Muscle-Separating Bone-Dislocating Ruyi Hand, and along with my Water-Breaking Noodle Preservation Profound Jade Hand, it is one of the Seven Great Prohibited Techniques of noodle masters. Through the Muscle-Separating Bone-Dislocating Ruyi Hand, while maintaining the dough's own moisture, the noodles' chewiness can be enhanced to the extreme. Generally, noodles kneaded with this method must be accompanied by a special cooking method, otherwise, even if cooked, you won't be able to bite them. In our culinary world, there's a saying: as long as a noodle master masters one of the Seven Great Prohibited Techniques, they can become a top-tier noodle master. I only know the Water-Breaking Noodle Preservation Profound Jade Hand, which ranks fourth among the Seven Great Prohibited Techniques. I never expected Big Brother Nian Bing to know the Muscle-Separating Bone-Dislocating Ruyi Hand, which ranks third. It seems I'm not as good as him in noodle-making either!\"\n\nNian Bing's movements stopped without any warning. He turned his head and smiled faintly at Ming Hui, saying, \"No, you're wrong. The Seven Great Prohibited Techniques don't prove anything. To be a top-tier noodle master, one still needs a comprehensive array of abilities. In terms of noodle craftsmanship, I absolutely cannot compare to you.\"\n\nA flash of green light, and the Heaven-Defying Blade appeared in Nian Bing's hand. The blade emitted a faint hum, spiritual energy overflowing.\n\n\"What a good blade! Is this your kitchen knife?\" Ming Hui asked in surprise.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"It's one of them. For pure knife skills, it's the most suitable. Its name is Heaven-Defying Blade, and it can also be called the Whisper of the Free Wind. I can't compare to you in noodle thinness, so I'll just rely on ingenuity.\" With a peculiar twist of his right wrist, he held the Heaven-Defying Blade in a reverse grip, his left hand holding out the round dough ball, which was now a full circle smaller than before.\n\nMing Hui knew that what Nian Bing was about to do was definitely not simple. She saw a more focused expression in Nian Bing's eyes than her own, but strangely, his focus wasn't on the dough, but on the blade – that Whisper of the Free Wind, the Heaven-Defying Blade.\n\nThe water in the iron pot was still boiling. Nian Bing's blade finally moved. It looked very slow, like a patch of green mist, but the shadow of the blade was no longer visible. One could only faintly perceive that the blade's tip was stabbing downwards towards the dough.\n\nHis wrist was trembling. A piece of white dough was picked into the pot. This was a prelude. Immediately after, piece after piece of white dough, as if threaded on a string, appeared as a string of white light formed by dough at three-inch intervals, entering the pot with crisp splashes. Nian Bing's movements were extremely fast; he consistently held the blade in a reverse grip. His expression was relaxed, and his gaze remained fixed on the indistinct blade shadow.\n\nMing Hui seemed to have realized something and quickly walked to the edge of the iron pot. When she saw the noodles tumbling in the boiling water in the pot, she was completely stunned. She slowly uttered four words, \"Brocade—Character—Empty—Window—.\"*\n\n---\n*   **Bird's Nest Noodles (一窩絲)**: A type of very thin, fine noodles, often resembling a bird's nest when cooked.\n*   **Brocade Character Empty Window (錦字虛牖)**: This is the specific name of a culinary technique, likely referring to an intricate, delicate presentation of noodles.",

    "content": "Xue Jing came to the iron pot in confusion. \"What is the Brocade Character Empty Window Technique,* uh...\" Then she saw it too. The noodles boiling in the pot were actually characters, not noodle pieces as she had imagined. The characters were very clear, two characters joined together, about an inch long and half an inch wide. They were distinctly the two characters \"Ming Hui.\" With vigorous, strong strokes, the characters were powerful, and every set of characters was exactly the same, without the slightest difference. How was this done?\n\nMing Hui stared blankly at the iron pot. \"The Brocade Character Empty Window Technique, one of the Five Great Famous Knife Techniques of the culinary world! I... I am actually fortunate enough to witness it. Master! Do you know? I actually saw the Brocade Character Empty Window Technique!\"\n\nXue Jing shook Ming Hui, asking with concern, \"Are you alright?\"\n\nMing Hui shook her head. \"Thank you, I'm fine, just too excited. You know, the Five Great Famous Knife Techniques of the culinary world are even more difficult than the Seven Forbidden Hands of Pastry Chefs. The Five Great Knife Techniques have long been lost. The Seven Forbidden Hands can still be mastered through talent and diligent practice, but the Five Great Knife Techniques require extraordinary comprehension and years of arduous practice. I used to hear Master talk about these five knife techniques, and at the time I thought it was too incredible, believing them to be impossible, miraculous skills. Only today do I realize how wrong I was, how much of a frog in a well* I was. The Brocade Character Empty Window Technique is right before me. This is the fourth-ranked knife technique among the Five Great Knife Techniques!\" Her body was trembling slightly, and her gaze towards Nian Bing was filled with admiration. If she knew that Nian Bing also knew the Dragon Dance Gathering Blade Technique,* the number one ranked knife technique among the Five Great Knife Techniques, what would she think? Although Nian Bing hadn't fully mastered the Dragon Dance Gathering Blade Technique yet, it was, after all, the top miraculous knife skill in the culinary world!\n\nUnder Ao Tian's miraculous poking and lifting, the noodles in Nian Bing's hand gradually diminished. In just a dozen or so breaths' time, he had completed all his movements without any pause. He picked up his chopsticks and stirred them in the pot. At the same time, his left hand, glowing red, pressed against the rim of the iron pot. The chopsticks swiftly left the moment his left hand touched the pot. Simultaneously, he swapped the chopsticks for a pot lid and slammed it onto the pot like lightning. Ming Hui and Xue Jing clearly felt the entire pot trembling violently. The pot body had turned completely red, and a scorching aura filled the entire kitchen.\n\nIn just three breaths' time, Nian Bing's left hand left the iron pot. His right hand lifted the pot lid and set it aside. Immediately, steam rose like a mushroom cloud. His left hand scooped up a skimmer, used it to retrieve the character-shaped noodles from the pot, and immediately immersed them in cold water. At the same time, his right hand remotely pressed down towards the bucket holding the cold water. His movements were as smooth and fluid as flowing clouds and running water, without any hesitation. If Ming Hui hadn't seen Nian Bing for the first time, she would have suspected that he had been in her own kitchen before. He seemed incredibly familiar with the location of every tool, without a single error.\n\nNian Bing's left hand, holding the skimmer, relaxed. Xue Jing and Ming Hui were surprised to find that the skimmer stood motionless in the water. Nian Bing seemed to have finished his work. He turned and smiled at the two women, saying, \"I used the Sinew-Separating Bone-Misaligning Wishful Hand* to increase the noodles'韧性 (chewiness/elasticity) to three times their original strength. I used high heat to quickly cook them through, and now I'm completely freezing them. By using the two extreme methods of ice and fire, I destroy the internal structure of the noodles. This way, the firm noodles produced by the Sinew-Separating Bone-Misaligning Wishful Hand won't be too tough to bite. At the same time, it completely brings out the inherent fragrance of the noodles, giving them an extremely chewy texture without being difficult to chew. Bringing out the original flavor of the ingredients themselves has always been my pursuit. Miss Ming Hui, I need to borrow your beef broth.\"\n\nAfter speaking, he took a clean, empty bowl, ladled half a bowl of beef broth from the bucket, added a little vinegar, a little sugar, and some chili oil, then quickly stirred it evenly. He then reached for the skimmer again. Under the effect of the fire element, the skimmer, carrying the frozen noodles, rose from the water bucket. The ice gradually melted. When the noodles emerged from the ice, he placed the ice into the bowl. The temperature of the room-temperature beef broth quickly dropped due to the ice, and the ice completely melted. The character-shaped noodles appeared in the bowl. Nian Bing lightly stirred them twice to completely blend the soup and noodles. His left hand remotely pressed down on the surface of the soup bowl, and a thin layer of ice appeared, as if the entire bowl had been frozen.\n\n\"Alright, it's done. Please, two ladies, taste this bowl of my Ice Fire Wishful Noodles.*\" Nian Bing smiled confidently at the two women.\n\nMing Hui exchanged a somewhat dazed glance with Xue Jing. Both picked up clean chopsticks and approached the noodle bowl. Their chopsticks easily broke through the thin ice. Each of them picked up a piece of noodle and put it into her mouth.\n\nMing Hui looked up at Nian Bing, her eyes filled with surprise. \"The icy cold noodles, combined with the icy noodle aroma, plus the three flavors of sour, sweet, and spicy, and the inherent freshness of the beef broth, it's truly delicious. As expected of the Ice Fire Cooking Demon!* I'm far from your skill.\"\n\nNian Bing humbly said, \"Miss Ming Hui, please don't say that. I only achieved this effect by borrowing the noodles you kneaded and the beef broth you prepared. When it comes to the art of noodle-making, I am indeed far inferior to you, Miss; I merely used a clever technique.\"\n\nA light flickered in Ming Hui's eyes. \"Are the Sinew-Separating Bone-Misaligning Wishful Hand and the Brocade Character Empty Window Technique also 'clever techniques'?\"\n\n\"You two can chat, I'll eat first.\" Xue Jing didn't care about techniques or culinary skills. She only knew that the bowl of noodles in front of her perfectly suited her taste. Although she had already eaten her fill of the clear beef noodle soup earlier, she couldn't resist the temptation of such a delicious dish.\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"The art of cooking is boundless. We still have much to learn, don't we?\"\n\nMing Hui took a deep breath, nodded, and said, \"Yes! The art of cooking is boundless. It seems I shouldn't be a frog in a well; there's so much more to learn. Big Brother Nian Bing, thank you for your guidance.\"\n\nNian Bing said sincerely, \"Miss Ming Hui, you're welcome. I also learned something from you.\"\n\nAfter leaving Yi Pin Noodles, Ming Hui had already reached an agreement with Xue Jing. Xue Jing wrote her a letter of recommendation, and soon after, she would travel far to Ice Snow City to gain experience at Qing Feng Zhai.\n\n\"Jing Jing, have you found a place to stay?\" Nian Bing asked softly as they walked down the street.\n\nXue Jing proactively linked her arm with Nian Bing's. She shook her head and said, \"Not yet. As soon as I arrived in Ice Orchid City, I rushed into the city. Since the streets were less crowded at night, I wanted to walk more, so I could leave the city early tomorrow morning and continue heading towards the capital of the Aolan Empire to find you. I knew you didn't have a horse, so I didn't even ride one this time. I'm utterly exhausted from the walk, how will you compensate me?\" She was incredibly excited now; not only had she found Nian Bing, but she had also recruited a skilled pastry chef for Qing Feng Zhai. This time, even if she returned to Qing Feng Zhai, her father wouldn't blame her, right?\n\nNian Bing tried to pull his arm away, feeling a little awkward, but Xue Jing stubbornly held onto him. As a mage, he truly couldn't contend with Xue Jing in terms of physical strength. Helpless, he could only let her have her way. A faint, delicate fragrance of a maiden occasionally wafted from Xue Jing, causing Nian Bing's heart to stir. He was still a virgin. Virgins, when faced with beautiful women, were always easily attracted, no matter how mature their minds were. In terms of physique, among all the women he knew, perhaps only Feng Nü could compare to her.\n\n\"Compensate? Didn't I just treat you to a meal? That's not compensation?\" Nian Bing somewhat avoided looking at Xue Jing and quickened his pace.\n\nXue Jing smiled. \"Of course not! You want to brush me off with just one meal? Do you take me for a beggar?\"\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile. \"Then what do you want me to do?\"\n\nXue Jing said, \"First, all expenses on the road will be your responsibility. No objections, okay? Second, when there are no restaurants, you must personally cook for me. I don't eat dry food. I've been so miserable eating dry food this whole journey.\"\n\nNian Bing's face showed a surprised expression. \"No way! You, the dignified young miss of Qing Feng Zhai, want to prey on me, a poor person? How heartless you are!\"\n\nXue Jing giggled. \"I'm a girl. Do you expect me to pay? I heard from Ling'er a long time ago that your magic scrolls are very valuable. Supporting me won't be a problem, right? I don't care; whether you agree or not, you have to agree.\"\n\n\"It seems I'll just have to resign myself to my fate. I hope there are still vacant rooms at the Lan Xin Hotel.\" He could only hope to reach the capital of the Aolan Empire soon. Then, he could get rid of this crazy woman. Sigh, why was it that the more he wanted to avoid relationships with women, the more beautiful women kept appearing around him? His master told him to find a girl he loved to be with, but what exactly was love between a man and a woman? Even as intelligent as Nian Bing was, in this regard, he was still like an innocent child. Xue Jing's pursuit made him vaguely feel something, but he couldn't quite articulate it.\n\n\"Even if there's a vacant room, it's too late. It's so late already, who would open a room for me now! Nian Bing, you're probably staying in a standard room, right? Anyway, there are two beds, so I'll just stay with you.\" Saying this, Xue Jing couldn't help but lower her head shyly.\n\nNian Bing was startled. \"What? No, no, you're a girl, how can you stay with me?\"\n\nXue Jing snorted. \"It's all your fault for delaying for so long just now. Do you want me to sleep on the streets? I'm a girl and I don't care, so what do you care about? Do you have any ulterior motives?\"\n\nNian Bing stared at Xue Jing, dumbfounded. \"You... you really want to stay in the same room as me? That's not good for your reputation! You'll eventually marry, and if your husband found out, I'm afraid...\"\n\nAn inexplicable wave of annoyance rose in Xue Jing's heart. \"Why are you talking so much nonsense? Will I eat you or something? Whether I marry or not is none of your business. At least tonight, I need a place to sleep peacefully. Hmph.\"\n\n\"Miss, are you really sure?\" Nian Bing tentatively asked.\n\nXue Jing snorted. \"Of course I'm sure! Are you afraid I'll r*pe you?\" As she said this, even she couldn't help but laugh, cursing inwardly, \"Xue Jing, oh Xue Jing, what's gotten into you now, how can you even say such a thing?\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment. Indeed, there was no better option at the moment. As Xue Jing said, his room had two beds. Although it was somewhat improper for a man and woman to share a room, as long as his conscience was clear, there shouldn shouldn't be any problem. Thinking this, he could only nod his head.\n\nXue Jing released Nian Bing's arm and asked, \"When are you planning to leave Ice Orchid City?\"\n\nNian Bing pondered. \"Tomorrow or the day after, I heard today that there's a famous local snack in Ice Orchid City called Staring Food.* It sounds very strange, and Master never told me about it, so I must try it. Also, I sold some magic scrolls to exchange for blank scrolls, and I need at least a day to make some magic scrolls for self-defense.\"\n\n\"Great! I'm not in a hurry.\" Xue Jing was naturally not in a hurry; she wished Nian Bing would go slower so she would have more time.\n\nBy the time the two returned to the Lan Xin Hotel, it was already late at night. The night watchman allowed them through the main entrance only after Nian Bing showed his room key. However, the guard did not leave. As Nian Bing was about to take Xue Jing upstairs, he was stopped by the guard.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir, we are a respectable hotel. We do not permit guests to engage in special activities within the hotel,\" the guard said somewhat impolitely.\n\nNian Bing was stunned. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nThe guard looked at Nian Bing, then at Xue Jing, who was dressed in red, and said indifferently, \"You should understand what I mean. It seems one of you two is not our guest, correct?\"\n\nNian Bing, being quick-witted, immediately understood the guard's meaning. He couldn't help but feel both annoyed and amused. \"This is my friend. She just arrived in Ice Orchid City tonight. It's too late now to get another room, so I can only bring her back to my place to make do for a night. We'll get a separate room tomorrow. Or, you can open a room for me now.\" The guard snorted. \"No, I don't have the authority to open rooms. Only one of you can go up.\" He thought to himself, *This pretty boy, relying on his good looks, can actually hook such a beautiful woman. Hmph, I just won't let him succeed.*\n\nAlthough Xue Jing was not as quick-witted as Nian Bing, at this point, the guard had made his meaning so clear that she couldn't possibly misunderstand. She immediately became furious. \"Bullshit! What kind of people do you take us for? Get lost, or don't blame me for taking action!\" As she spoke, she placed her hand on her sword hilt, and a red battle qi immediately enveloped her delicate body. Nian Bing, however, was not angry at this moment; instead, he was secretly grateful to the guard in front of him. Earlier, out of consideration for Xue Jing's pride, he couldn't directly refuse her, but he had always felt it was improper to share a room with her. Now, with the guard's obstruction, he could take advantage of the situation to gracefully back out. He quickly stopped Xue Jing. \"Jing Jing, don't mess around! Have you forgotten what you promised me earlier? He's right, this is for the guests' safety. Here's the key, you go up and sleep.\"\n***\n#### Footnotes:\n*   **Brocade Character Empty Window Technique (錦字虛牗, *Jǐn Zì Xū Yǒu*)**: A highly advanced knife technique in culinary arts, capable of shaping food into intricate characters.\n*   **Frog in a well (坐井觀天, *zuò jǐng guān tiān*)**: An idiom meaning to have a limited outlook or narrow perspective, like a frog in a well that can only see a small patch of sky.\n*   **Dragon Dance Gathering Blade Technique (龍雩集舞刀法, *Lóng Yú Jí Wǔ Dāo Fǎ*)**: Another highly advanced and powerful knife technique in culinary arts, considered the top skill.\n*   **Sinew-Separating Bone-Misaligning Wishful Hand (分筋錯骨如意手, *Fēn Jīn Cuò Gǔ Rú Yì Shǒu*)**: A powerful technique, likely related to kneading or manipulating ingredients to enhance their texture and properties.\n*   **Ice Fire Wishful Noodles (冰火如意面, *Bīng Huǒ Rú Yì Miàn*)**: A dish whose name refers to the extreme hot and cold preparation methods used, yielding a unique flavor and texture.\n*   **Ice Fire Cooking Demon (冰火廚魔, *Bīng Huǒ Chú Mó*)**: A title or epithet used to describe someone with exceptional skill in culinary arts, particularly those involving both ice and fire elements.\n*   **Staring Food (瞪眼食, *Dèng Yǎn Shí*)**: A local specialty dish; its name literally means \"staring at it food,\" suggesting it might be visually striking or eaten while looking intently.",

    "content": "Xue Jing's heart was incessantly racing as she was about to share a room with Nian Bing, leaving her somewhat at a loss. After all, she was a grown girl; although she liked Nian Bing, she knew it was inappropriate to share a room with him. Yet, she also felt it was an opportunity she didn't want to miss, so she had been hesitating. At this moment, Nian Bing breathed a sigh of relief, and she, too, sighed in relief, though with a tinge of disappointment in her heart.\n\n\"Nian Bing, what about you? I'm staying in your room, what will you do?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Don't worry about me. Isn't there a sofa in the lobby? I'll make do there for a night.\" Xue Jing glared fiercely at the security guard, snorted, and then headed upstairs.\n\nSeeing Xue Jing leave, the security guard said to Nian Bing, \"The lobby isn't for overnight stays. If you want to check in, please come back first thing tomorrow morning. I'm closing now, please leave immediately.\"\n\nNian Bing was momentarily stunned, his brows slightly furrowed. \"Are you targeting me? I don't recall offending you.\"\n\nThe security guard said coldly, \"I'm just following regulations. Please leave.\"\n\nNian Bing naturally wouldn't stoop to the level of such ordinary people. Having no choice, he had to leave the Lan Xin Hotel again.\n\nIt was late, and the weather, nearing October, was slightly chilly. The night dew bit at Nian Bing's body, causing him to shiver. He quickly circulated the fire elements within his body, which made him feel more comfortable. Although the night dew brought him cold, with Xue Jing not by his side, his mind gradually became active in the crisp, cool air.\n\nXue Jing sneaking out from home just to find me already proves she has feelings for me! Xue Jing likes me, and she isn't as weak as Long Ling. If she keeps following me, who knows what else will happen on the way to the Olan Imperial Capital? If I lose self-control, that would be trouble. Perhaps I don't have feelings for Xue Jing, but there is definitely desire present. Facing a beauty, can I always remain calm? Very difficult, very difficult.\n\nDeep in Nian Bing's heart, besides his mother, there had always been only one woman's figure. He felt pity for Long Ling, admiration for Luo Rou, and he even somewhat feared Xue Jing—feared her hysterical madness when she went wild—but he definitely didn't have that kind of love from the bottom of his heart. Therefore, he truly didn't wish to spend too much time with any of the three girls. Even if he didn't fall for her, once Xue Jing's feelings for him deepened, the situation would become even harder to resolve. He couldn't very well hit her or drive her away.\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing's mind raced like lightning, pondering a suitable method.\n\nSuddenly, his heart stirred. Why did Xue Jing like him? Perhaps it was because of some strengths he had shown that attracted her. If he let her see more of his flaws, perhaps her feelings for him would gradually cool. Xue Jing was a girl who dared to love and dared to hate, and her temper would flare up with a touch. Xue Jing, I'm sorry, I can only do this.\n\nA peculiar expression appeared on his face. Nian Bing walked towards the dark street. Soon, he found his destination. In the dead of night, there was probably only one type of establishment that didn't close: a brothel.\n\n\"Oh, sir. Here to have some fun? Although it's a bit late, we still have plenty of girls here.\" A heavily made-up madam, looking thirty or forty years old, led Nian Bing inside.\n\nThis was only a medium-sized brothel. Upon entering, the pungent scent of cosmetics almost knocked Nian Bing over. At this moment, he couldn't help but feel a little flustered. His understanding of brothels was equivalent to zero; he didn't even know what brothels specifically did. After all, Cha Ji wouldn't have introduced brothel knowledge to him while teaching him cooking skills, right? The reason he knew of brothels was from overhearing a conversation between passersby in Ice Snow City once. It was a couple, the husband being scolded by his wife like a frost-bitten eggplant*. From their conversation, Nian Bing gathered that the husband had gone to a place called a brothel, which his wife found intolerable. He still vividly remembered that heart-stirring scene; had murdering one's husband not been a serious crime, he had no doubt the wife would have chopped her husband to death with a cleaver. Later, he once asked Long Ling what a brothel was, and Long Ling, who never lost her temper, blushed, scolded him a few times, and ran off. From then on, Nian Bing roughly guessed that this so-called brothel was a place men liked and women extremely detested. Walking on the streets, he had also seen a few brothels, so he could still distinguish them by their appearance.\n\nCoughed awkwardly, Nian Bing looked at the madam, whose eyes were shining, and asked, \"Is there a place to stay here?\" The last time he heard that couple argue, he vaguely heard the wife scolding her husband for not returning home at night because of the brothel, so presumably brothels could accommodate overnight stays.\n\nOriginally, Nian Bing's ordinary attire shouldn't have attracted the madam's attention. However, his looks were simply too handsome, causing the madam's amorous feelings to stir. She secretly thought, such a handsome young man, if he could sleep with her for a night, it would be worth it even if she had to pay him.\n\n\"Stay? Of course, we have rooms! I just don't know how you wish to stay, sir! Girls, we have a guest, quickly come and welcome him!\"\n\nBy this time, it was late at night, and most of the courtesans either already had guests or were preparing to sleep. Hearing the madam's summons, the courtesans without guests were greatly impatient. One by one, they descended from the attic, sleepy-eyed, looking towards the hall. When their eyes fell on Nian Bing, all the courtesans stopped moving.\n\nNian Bing suddenly shivered all over. He saw seven or eight young women walking down the stairs, each lightly dressed, their arms and thighs mostly exposed. Some hadn't even properly covered their bosoms, revealing plump cleavages. He hadn't been in society long; when had he ever seen such a seductive scene? Immediately, he felt the blood within his body gradually boiling, and his heartbeat inexplicably accelerated.\n\nThe courtesans finally reacted. \"Swarmed\" was the most accurate description; in an instant, they surrounded Nian Bing. It was as if they also possessed martial arts; their desirous gazes and alluring postures were so captivating.\n\n\"Sir, come to my room. I'm a famous pure jade maiden!\"\n\n\"What's a pure jade maiden? Sir, look, is mine big? Come, I'll definitely serve you well tonight. How about I give you a 20% discount?\"\n\n\"A 20% discount? Sir, how about I give you a 40% discount? I'm so lonely tonight.\"\n\nSweat, cold sweat dripped down his forehead. Even when facing the Golden-backed Dragon King, Nian Bing had never been so nervous. He suddenly realized that the method he had chosen was simply terrible. Such a seductive scene instantly plunged this novice into infinite awkwardness. What to do? What to do now? He wanted to say something, but he just couldn't. Looking at those women acting demurely, he found that he had already gotten goosebumps. Heavens! Gods! Save me!\n\n\"Alright, alright, girls, stop arguing. Let this gentleman choose for himself. Sir, who do you choose?\" The madam was experienced and knowledgeable. Seeing Nian Bing's awkward expression, she knew it was his first time in a place like this. If it had been anyone else, she would have been too lazy to bother, but Nian Bing's handsome appearance and magnificent physique truly stirred the madam's heart, so she took the initiative to resolve the situation.\n\nThe madam directed the girls to stand in a neat row and pressed herself against Nian Bing's side, her ample bosom brushing against his arm. \"Sir, which girl would you like to choose? If none of them catch your eye, what about me?\"\n\nNian Bing looked down at the madam. He had to admit that this madam, who looked around thirty, was no less charming than those young girls, and she had a few more points of maturity. Especially her somewhat exaggeratedly ample figure gave him an urge for a nosebleed. Heavens, is this what a brothel is? All his wisdom seemed to have vanished. He asked dazedly, \"This, this, how much does it cost to stay here for one night?\"\n\nNian Bing's innocent demeanor made the madam itch with desire even more; certain parts of her body had already begun to change. \"What's money got to do with it? It's our honor for you to grace us with your presence, sir. Afterwards, just pay what you think is right. We have plenty of rooms here, just choose whatever you like.\"\n\n\"Ahem, then give me an empty room. I'll pay whatever it costs, I'll just stay one night and then leave.\" Nian Bing's words immediately provoked a burst of charming laughter from the girls. The madam squeezed the firm muscle on his forearm. \"Oh, sir, don't you fancy any of us girls? Here, there's no rule for sleeping alone! Just choose one to accompany you.\"\n\n\"Why is it so noisy, Mama? Aren't you closing tonight? There won't be any more guests, will there?\" A languid voice drifted down from upstairs. Although it sounded like a complaint, one had to admit, her voice was unusually captivating.\n\nThe courtesans in front of Nian Bing and the madam beside him both changed their expressions. One of the courtesans even muttered softly, \"It's over, it's over, once she comes, this top-tier virgin boy definitely won't be mine.\"\n\nNian Bing looked upstairs and saw a woman in a pink dress descending the stairs. Her figure was well-proportioned and full, her fair, pretty face lightly made up, and she exuded a graceful scent. She seemed somewhat tired, leaning on the railing as she walked down, her brows slightly furrowed, yet it created an unusual beauty. Her appearance immediately overshadowed all the other women present. While not a peerless beauty like Feng Nü, her looks were certainly top-tier.\n\nThe madam sighed inwardly and smiled apologetically at Nian Bing. \"Sir, you see, this is our chief courtesan. Although her fee is a bit higher, she's definitely worth the price! Ruyi, we have a guest.\"\n\nThe young woman slightly raised her head. When her hazy gaze met Nian Bing's clear eyes, her beautiful large eyes immediately lit up. She didn't lose composure like the other courtesans earlier. She walked slowly downstairs, a smile like a hundred flowers blooming appearing on her pretty face. She approached Nian Bing and said, \"Hello, sir, my name is Ruyi.\"\n\nNian Bing had gradually adapted to the atmosphere here and was no longer as flustered as before. He nodded slightly. \"Hello.\"\n\nRuyi turned her head to look at the madam beside her. \"Mama, let Ruyi entertain this gentleman tonight, okay?\"\n\nThe madam wanted to say no, but Ruyi was the leading courtesan of this brothel. Most guests who came here did so for her sake. She couldn't afford to offend this money tree! She quickly said, \"Good, of course, good, Ruyi, then you take this gentleman to your room.\"\n\nOne woman was easier to handle than a group of women. Although Nian Bing still didn't fully understand what brothels were for, this graceful young woman brought him a bit of goodwill. Going with her was better than being pestered by a group of common harlots.\n\nRuyi took Nian Bing's hand. Both had different feelings. Ruyi felt Nian Bing's hand was slender and strong, with no calluses. His hand was very warm, but seemed to have a steel-like hardness. Nian Bing had a completely different feeling. Although it wasn't his first time holding a girl's hand, Ruyi felt entirely different. Her hand was very soft, almost boneless, and what impressed Nian Bing the most was the coldness of her hand. Her small hand was very smooth and extremely comfortable to hold.\n\nUpstairs, Ruyi said nothing, leading him directly to the innermost room in the corridor. The room's decor was mostly pink. The room was large, divided into inner and outer sections, but without a door separating them. The inner section had a large bed, surrounded by drapes. The entire room exuded a strange atmosphere.\n\n\"Please sit, sir.\" Ruyi's voice suddenly lost its previous gentle feeling. She led Nian Bing to the round table in the outer section, pressing his shoulders to make him sit down. She poured a glass of wine and handed it to Nian Bing, while she herself sat down beside him.\n\nNian Bing drank the wine in one gulp, and a warm feeling rose in his belly, instantly calming his mind significantly. Yet, he still asked a silly question, \"Miss Ruyi, there's only one bed here. Where do I sleep? Why do your rules require guests to enter one of your rooms?\"\n\nRuyi was momentarily stunned. She looked up at Nian Bing. \"This is a brothel.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Then why do you still ask such questions?\" A cold glint appeared in Ruyi's eyes.\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly. \"To be frank, although I know this is a brothel, I don't know what brothels are for. Can you tell me?\"\n\nRuyi answered irrelevantly, \"Then what are you doing?\"\n\n---\n*   **Like a frost-bitten eggplant**: A Chinese idiom (霜打的茄子) describing someone who is utterly dejected, crestfallen, or withered, much like an eggplant that has been damaged by frost.",

    "content": "Nian Bing watched Ruyi's eyes gradually clear, a faint sense of unease stirring within him. \"I am a chef.\"\n\n\"A chef? Are you just a chef? I've met many people, but I've never seen a chef with your demeanor. So young, yet not learning good habits, running around haunting brothels—I don't think you're any good either.\" By the end, her voice had gained a chill.\n\nNian Bing slightly furrowed his brow. \"Why does coming to a brothel make one not a good person?\"\n\nRuyi said disdainfully, \"Men, all of you think with your lower bodies. Don't you come here just to release your lusts on women? When do you ever treat women like us as human beings? What a waste of your good looks—gold and jade on the outside, rotten flocculent within.\"*\n\nIt was not until this moment that Nian Bing finally understood the true meaning of a brothel. He broke into a cold sweat! He hastily explained, \"Miss Ruyi, please don't misunderstand.\"\n\nRuyi scoffed as she stood up. \"Misunderstand? What's there for me to misunderstand? Men like you will undoubtedly break countless women's hearts in the future.\"\n\nNian Bing's gaze turned cold. \"Miss Ruyi, there seems to be no enmity between us, so why are you targeting me like this? Even if I came to a brothel for 'that kind of thing,' so what? You're supposed to be serving me, not scolding me here.\"\n\nRuyi's smile grew colder. \"Serve you? Do you, a filthy person like you, even think of touching me?\"\n\n\"Since that's the case, I'll leave.\" Having understood the true meaning of a brothel, Nian Bing, though he had wanted to use the opportunity to provoke Xue Jing into leaving, truly couldn't stand staying in such a place any longer. He didn't have much understanding of matters between men and women. He didn't look down on prostitutes; he just felt that doing such things was inappropriate. He stood up, just about to leave, but suddenly felt a wave of dizziness in his mind. Unconsciously, he sat back down.\n\n\"Do you still want to leave?\" Ruyi looked coldly at Nian Bing.\n\n\"Poison?\" Nian Bing suddenly understood a lot. He subconsciously tried to activate the Touch Magic Scroll on his person, but his mind couldn't focus. \"Miss Ruyi, I have no grievances or enmity with you, why are you trying to harm me?\"\n\nRuyi smiled. \"When you reach hell, then ask.\"\n\nNian Bing's mind blurred, and he finally couldn't hold on, fainting.\n\n\"Sis, what's wrong with you today?\" A nimble figure darted out from the inner room. It was a young girl in full combat attire, her appearance somewhat similar to Ruyi's, but with more heroism. She glanced at Nian Bing and said, \"This seems to be just an ordinary customer! How did you drug him unconscious? How will you resolve this?\"\n\nRuyi said faintly, \"Rumeng, take him out of the city and kill him. Handle it cleanly.\"\n\n\"Sis, are you crazy? The organization strictly forbids killing indiscriminately. We don't kill targets without remuneration. You're...\" Rumeng was clearly startled by Ruyi.\n\nRuyi's gaze swept sharply over Rumeng. \"I'm merely eliminating a scoundrel for the people; what's wrong with that? Look at this man—he has good looks, yet he runs around haunting brothels. He looks to be only around twenty years old. If such a person is allowed to live in this world, who knows how many women he'll harm in the future? Have you forgotten how I was deceived back then? Don't hesitate just because he's handsome; the more handsome a man is, the more he deserves to die.\" As she spoke, her eyes revealed an overwhelming hatred, her entire body seemed to tremble slightly, and the hysterical feeling made Rumeng show a hint of fear.\n\n\"Go, you know what to do. I'll handle the madam.\" Ruyi glared fiercely at Nian Bing and waved her hand at Rumeng.\n\nRumeng said no more. She tugged at Nian Bing's clothes and easily hoisted him onto her shoulder. It seemed to take no effort. Opening the window, she darted out like a civet cat, disappearing from sight in a few flashes.\n\nWatching Rumeng's retreating figure, a misty sheen of tears appeared in Ruyi's eyes. \"No man is good. Handsome men are even more of a scourge on the world. I'll kill every one I see. Only when all handsome men are dead can women live better lives.\"\n\nBinglan City is a commercial city. Although it is located at the border of two countries, its city gates are never closed at night. Rumeng, carrying Nian Bing's body, quietly left the city and soon arrived at a quiet forest. She laid him flat on the ground.\n\n\"Should this person really be killed? There's no trace of Dou Qi in his body; he's just an ordinary person. My sister really is something; she can't just kill innocent people indiscriminately! Never mind, since he's just an ordinary person, I'll explain things clearly to him and just have him leave quickly. The continent is so vast, my sister won't be able to see him again in the future. Hmm, he really is handsome, much more handsome than my previous brother-in-law. No wonder my sister reacted so strongly today.\" As she spoke, Rumeng shook her head helplessly, took out a porcelain bottle from her bosom, and pulled out a pill, putting it into Nian Bing's mouth.\n\nIn fact, she didn't know that it was precisely because of her kind intention that she saved her own life. Although Nian Bing was short on scrolls, he still carried four self-defense Touch Magic Scrolls on him, the strongest of which was a sixth-tier. If Rumeng had truly tried to kill him, the scrolls would have automatically activated when the magic array sensed Nian Bing's life was threatened. With Rumeng's current ability, she wouldn't have even had a chance to dodge at close range.\n\nA chill ran through him, and Nian Bing awoke from his coma. \"Hmm? Where is this?\" The darkness before his eyes greatly alarmed him. His mind immediately connected with the magic scrolls on his person, ready to deal with any crisis at any moment.\n\n\"Sir, I'm truly sorry.\"\n\nHearing Rumeng's voice, Nian Bing realized there was someone else beside him. He quickly stood up, stepping back a few paces to maintain distance from Rumeng. Since Rumeng's appearance was sixty to seventy percent similar to Ruyi's, and his mind wasn't fully clear at the moment, he immediately mistook her. \"Miss Ruyi, what is this place? Why did you bring me here?\"\n\nRumeng apologized, \"Sir, I'm not Ruyi; that's my sister. My name is Rumeng. I'm truly sorry about what happened today.\"\n\nUpon closer inspection, Nian Bing noticed that Rumeng was different from Ruyi. Comparatively, Rumeng was a little thinner and taller than Ruyi. \"Miss Rumeng? I'd like to know what happened.\"\n\nRumeng was somewhat surprised. Unfazed by the unexpected, this handsome man before her wasn't as ordinary as he claimed! \"Sir, please don't misunderstand. It's like this: my sister works in the brothel for a reason. I can't tell you the specifics, but she's definitely not the kind of woman you imagine. My sister was once harmed, which is why she reacts quite extremely to things. Sir, I have some money here; please leave this place quickly and don't go back to Binglan City.\" As she spoke, she threw a few gold coins towards Nian Bing.\n\nLooking at the somewhat naive girl before him, Nian Bing calmly said, \"Miss Rumeng, your sister inexplicably poisoned me, and you're unwilling to explain things clearly. Is Binglan City yours? Why can't I go back?\"\n\nRumeng slightly furrowed her brow. \"You, why are you so stubborn? Do you want to die?\"\n\n\"Die? Your sister wants to kill me? I have no hatred for her, so why would she want to kill me?\" Nian Bing voiced the doubts in his heart, while also inwardly cursing himself for being careless, for falling into such a trap so easily.\n\nRumeng said helplessly, \"I can't talk about my sister's affairs. Anyway, this is all I can do. If you go back to the city, I won't be able to save you. For your own life's sake, just leave.\" After speaking, she no longer lingered with Nian Bing. She unfolded her figure, and with a few flashes and bounds, disappeared from Nian Bing's sight.\n\nNian Bing stood rooted to the spot, various thoughts continuously surging in his mind. Ruyi, Rumeng—these two names kept appearing alternately. What exactly was going on? He was truly unlucky to the extreme; it seemed doing bad deeds still wasn't advisable! However. To be played with like this and nearly lose his life, should he just let it go? No, he at least had to find out the truth.\n\nHis mind connected with the Spatial Ring. Spatial magic elements revolved around Nian Bing's finger, and a silver halo emanated from the unassuming ring. A black robe appeared first. Immediately after, an eerie skull mask silently materialized over the robe. Nian Bing first put on the mask, then used the robe to cover his body. The robe had a hood, covering even his head. This covered his easily recognizable golden hair. \"This identity can finally be used again. I never thought it would be for a brothel.\"\n\n\"Oh, great Goddess of Ice and Snow! Please lend me your wrath and send me to the lost shore. —Blizzard.\" The temperature in the air gradually dropped as blue light motes converged on Nian Bing. Snowflakes gradually appeared, swirling around his body. Directly chanting spells to use magic was bothersome in this aspect; it required chanting to gather magic power, which always wasted some time. However, using magic directly from a scroll allowed the magic's full power to be displayed because enough magic power had already been condensed onto the scroll beforehand.\n\nUnder the influence of powerful magic control, the blizzard forcibly lifted Nian Bing's body, carrying him higher and higher. Once in the air, he naturally saw the location of Binglan City and controlled the magic to fly towards the city. As he flew, Nian Bing carefully recalled everything that had happened in that brothel. The woman named Ruyi was clearly not just a simple prostitute. These two sisters, having placed themselves in a brothel, must have some purpose. Just as Rumeng had said, Ruyi must have suffered some kind of trauma. The moment he had entered her room, the aura emanating from her wasn't just coldness; it seemed to contain some killing intent, though he hadn't fully sensed it at the time. The trauma she suffered should be related to men, and specifically, men somewhat similar to himself, just like when he had once treated that beautiful aunt as his mother. But brothels are sordid places; why would they hide there? That's what he had to find out.\n\nThinking this, Nian Bing couldn't help but inwardly celebrate—not celebrating that Rumeng had let him go, but celebrating that the wine he had inadvertently drunk was merely a sleeping drug and not a gut-wrenching poison. Otherwise, no matter how many magic scrolls he had on him, they would have been useless. By this time, he had returned to Binglan City. The entire city was deep in slumber. Nian Bing carefully manipulated the blizzard beneath his feet; as long as his magic power wasn't exhausted, the blizzard would be sustained. After this period of understanding magic, he now knew better how to utilize his magic power more efficiently. Therefore, sustaining a fourth-tier magic like this was nothing to him. At this moment, he had already taken out the Ao Tian Blade and Zhengyang Blade separately. After all, he hadn't left the Ice Moon Empire yet, so it was better not to use Chen Lu for now.\n\nAlthough he hadn't been in Binglan City long, Nian Bing's memory was excellent. First, after flying over the city gates, he located the Lanxin Inn where he was staying. From the inn, he immediately confirmed his bearings and flew towards the brothel. Perhaps because it was too late, the brothel's lights had finally extinguished. Nian Bing floated in the air, surveying the entire brothel from above. He quickly found Ruyi's room and lightly drifted to the outside of it. He hesitated slightly. Just as he was about to make a move, he heard a low voice from inside the room. His heart stirred, and he controlled the blizzard to press his body against the window, listening to the sounds within. Rumeng seemed to have just returned, and she quietly said to Ruyi, \"Sis, why aren't you asleep yet?\"\n\nRuyi said coldly, \"Is everything settled? Was it done cleanly? In this mixed bag of people, you must not leave any loose ends.\"\n\nRumeng hesitated for a moment. \"It's done, Sis. Don't worry.\"\n\nRuyi sighed softly. \"Little sister, I know you're sometimes in a difficult position. Your heart is too soft; you're simply not suited to be an assassin. After our rotation is over this time, I'll report to the master and have him transfer you to another post. Perhaps I can even let you become an overt warrior.\"\n\n\"Sis, that's impossible. I was trained to be a spy! How can I become a warrior?\" A hint of sadness seemed to enter Rumeng's tone.\n\nRuyi said, \"Actually, nothing is impossible. After all, unlike me, I've long been exposed to people, while you've always been in the shadows. Trust your sister, there will definitely be a chance.\"\n\nHearing this, Nian Bing, who was outside, immediately understood a great deal. These two sisters were clearly not from the Ice Moon Empire but were here as spies, gathering various information from the diverse guests who frequented this brothel and transmitting it back to their home country. It seemed his own matter could only be dropped. It was better not to get involved in such conflicts between nations. Thinking this, he controlled the blizzard, just about to leave. As he turned, his black robe inadvertently brushed against the window, producing a slight friction sound.\n\n\"Who's there?\" Amidst the low voice, a cold glint shot out through the window. Although it was judged purely by sound, the cold glint was aimed precisely at Nian Bing's chest. Nian Bing inwardly thought, *This is bad*. He didn't activate his self-defense magic scroll. With a raised right hand, the Ao Tian Blade transformed into dozens of blade shadows, each striking at the cold glint from a different direction.\n\n---\n*   \"Gold and jade on the outside, rotten flocculent within\": An idiom meaning outwardly beautiful or good, but inwardly corrupt or worthless.",

    "title": "Chapter 44: The Demonic Killing Reappears (Part 1)",
    "content": "Ding. Dozens of dense impacts, due to their extreme speed, seemed like only one sound. Nian Bing only felt a powerful冲击 force assault his face, his chest feeling as if struck by a heavy hammer. His body drifted backward, utilizing the impact force. If it weren't for the blade aura emitted by his Heaven's Pride Blade, which resisted a good deal of the impact, this simple collision alone would have been enough to injure him. What flew out was a shuttle-shaped dart, which had now been shredded to dust by Heaven's Pride's sharpness. A radiant divine light shone in Nian Bing's eyes as he instantly controlled the Blizzard to send himself tens of meters away.\n\nThe window opened, and two figures, carrying two cold glows, rushed out. Though their Battle Qi was powerful, they absolutely could not fly. When the Ruyi sisters discovered the enemy was floating in mid-air, their hearts instantly startled. Before landing, they each released three darts that shot towards Nian Bing's location. Unfortunately, Nian Bing was already prepared; although the Battle Qi attached to the darts was extremely strong, he merely controlled the Blizzard to gently support his body, dodging the darts. A mage in the air has somewhat of an advantage over a warrior on the ground.\n\nRuyi and Rumeng each held a gleaming, cold sword. Ruyi stopped Rumeng, who was preparing to strike again, and coldly shouted at Nian Bing in the air: \"Who are you?\"\n\nNian Bing calmly said: \"This is no place for talking. If you have the guts, follow me.\" He deliberately lowered his voice and added a few raspy tones to it, preventing the Ruyi sisters from recognizing him. As soon as his voice fell, he immediately controlled the Blizzard to fly towards outside the city. The Ruyi sisters exchanged glances. They knew their identities had been exposed and had no choice but to pursue, unfolding their figures.\n\nDuring short-distance flight, Blizzard was the fastest speed a mage could achieve. Although Nian Bing could tell the Ruyi sisters both possessed Swordsman-level strength, it was impossible for them to catch up to his Blizzard. He controlled his speed well, always maintaining a certain distance from the Ruyi sisters. He led them back out of Ice Orchid City, running towards the wilderness.\n\nAs Ruyi and Rumeng followed Nian Bing, they secretly made their calculations. Mages were extremely rare on the continent; they were very clear on this point. Precisely because of this, they had no experience fighting mages, let alone understanding how to deal with them. Rumeng's heart was anxious. Just as she didn't know what to do, she suddenly heard Ruyi softly shout: \"Shifting Flowers, Grafting Wood!\"\n\nAzure Battle Qi emanated from Ruyi's body, and she suddenly leaped into the air. Hearing the four words her sister shouted, Rumeng instantly understood. She held her longsword in her mouth and also burst forth with azure Battle Qi. She pushed Ruyi's feet upward with both palms, powerfully sending her sister forward. In that instant, her Battle Qi, of the same origin as Ruyi's, completely flowed into Ruyi's body. Instantly, Ruyi's protective Battle Qi flared brightly, and she swiftly traversed ten *zhang* through the air, reaching a distance of two *zhang* from Nian Bing in the sky. Her qi aura locked onto Nian Bing's body, and holding her sword with both hands, she delivered a full-force diagonal slash. The azure Battle Qi formed a dazzling azure arc of light in mid-air, with twisting rays, slashing towards Nian Bing.\n\nFeeling the dangerous qi aura, Nian Bing's heart greatly trembled. He had nearly failed to withstand the impact of that previous dart, let alone this full-force slash. His protective scroll instantly activated, and Ice Wall Spell condensed a solid ice wall a *chi* thick, blocking the Battle Qi slash. Combining the Battle Qi of both Ruyi sisters, the power of this attack was terrifying. The one-meter thick solid ice instantly cracked under the extremely sharp Battle Qi slash, and the azure light pierced through the ice wall. Although greatly weakened, it still continued to slash towards Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing chose to use the Ice Wall Spell not to block the opponent, but to sever the opponent's qi aura lock on him, as well as to slow down their attack. When the azure light slashed at his previous location, he had already flown diagonally away, carried by the Blizzard. Ruyi, her strength exhausted, fell towards the ground. Rumeng caught up to her sister, and both stopped simultaneously. The mysterious power displayed by the magic made their hearts tighten.\n\nNian Bing floated down ten *zhang* away from the two women. The Blizzard had not ended; instead, it was continuously compressing under the effect of his powerful spiritual energy. This mutated Blizzard, even grand mages from the past would have been alarmed by it; using it for self-defense was naturally the best choice. \"The two ladies use Wind-attribute Battle Qi,\" Nian Bing calmly stated.\n\nRuyi stepped forward, staring intently at Nian Bing. \"Who exactly are you?\"\n\nNian Bing said: \"You can call me the Demonic Assassin.\"\n\nRuyi coldly said: \"So, you heard our previous conversation?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said: \"I don't care what country's spies you are, but I cannot ignore the wanton disregard for human life. Miss Ruyi, the man you dealt with earlier is under my protection. For Miss Rumeng's kindness, I don't wish to make things difficult for you. You may leave. However, in the future, I hope Miss Ruyi will act with more caution. He who kills, shall forever be killed.\"\n\nRuyi looked at her sister. \"Meng, you...\"\n\nRumeng dared not meet her sister's gaze and instinctively lowered her head. Ruyi coldly stared at Nian Bing. \"Mages have no advantage against warriors. You don't want to make things difficult for us, but I'd like to try and make things difficult for you. If you've got guts, don't run.\" Her body moved with her words. The greatest characteristic of Wind-attribute Battle Qi was its ability to increase the user's attack speed. With a few flashes, Ruyi was already in front of Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing did not retreat. He let out a cold snort, and the Blizzard, condensed to a diameter of one *chi*, instantly exploded. The compressed Blizzard, in terms of attack power, was absolutely no less than a sixth-rank magic. Ruyi only felt as if her path forward had encountered a massive wall; countless rotating ice blades seemed to tear at her body. Her protective Battle Qi was shredded to pieces amidst the furiously rotating ice blades. The instant the Blizzard exploded, her charging body was blasted backward. Her clothes now had countless tears, bloodstains faintly visible, and her fair skin was revealed.\n\nBlood spurted out wildly. Under the effect of the mutated Blizzard, Ruyi was instantly severely wounded. Indeed, in a one-on-one situation, a mage is definitely at a disadvantage, but this refers to a mage who has no time to chant spells. If a warrior faces an opponent who has already prepared their magic, then the chance of winning is very small.\n\n\"Sister,\" Rumeng caught Ruyi's body. Ruyi's body was very cold; the chilling poison carried by the Blizzard had already invaded her meridians. Towards Ruyi, who had tried to kill him, Nian Bing showed no mercy whatsoever. Fortunately, Ruyi's own Battle Qi was not weak, which was why she wasn't completely torn apart by the Blizzard.\n\n\"Great Ice Elementals! Condense, become the ice of ancient frozen rivers, become the solid ice of moonlit essence. Fusion of ice, appear, Two-Color Ice Sealing Orb!\" While Rumeng was tending to her sister, Nian Bing chanted another spell. A giant Two-Color Ice Sealing Orb appeared before him. He dared not show any slackness when facing warriors.\n\nRuyi was now barely breathing, blood continuously overflowing from her mouth. Her most severe injury was not the wounds on her body, but the chilling qi that had been vibrated into her body when the Blizzard exploded. At this moment, the blood in her body was continuously coagulating; when her heart meridians froze, that would be the moment of her death. The thought of cherishing and protecting women never appeared in Nian Bing's mind. He only knew that his own life was the most precious.\n\n\"You. What did you do to my sister? I'll fight you to the death!\" Rumeng laid Ruyi's body flat, then, raising her sword, charged towards Nian Bing.\n\nDozens of Wind-attribute Battle Qi slashes materialized from her sword. Nian Bing was surprised to find that Rumeng's Battle Qi seemed even purer than her sister's. However, the Two-Color Ice Sealing Orb had already formed. This sixth-rank magic was absolutely incomparable to the previous low-level fourth-rank Ice Wall Spell. The Two-Color Ice Sealing Orb continuously changed its position under Nian Bing's skillful mental control. Rumeng's attacks, apart from leaving some marks on the Ice Sealing Orb, could not pose any threat to Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing still had some goodwill towards Rumeng; at the very least, her heart was much kinder than Ruyi's. \"Miss Rumeng, if you don't want your sister to die, then stop.\" After blocking Rumeng's attack again, the Two-Color Ice Sealing Orb gleamed with cold light. From within the biting cold, dozens of ice cones shot out, instantly forcing Rumeng back.\n\nRumeng looked, somewhat panting, at the powerful mage before her. \"You, you've already killed my sister, and you're still speaking so indifferently?\"\n\nNian Bing calmly said: \"Your sister only suffered shock injuries; what's fatal is the invasion of the cold current. Right now, only I can make her live again. You should understand. It would be effortless for me to kill you; there's no need to deceive you.\" The greatest characteristic of the Two-Color Ice Sealing Orb was its destructive power. If facing a group of enemies, it could continuously unleash powerful ice cones until it self-destructed. Once this sixth-rank magic formed, unless the opponent possessed the strength of a Grand Swordsman or higher, it would be impossible to break the Two-Color Ice Sealing Orb.\n\nIn Nian Bing's calm voice, Rumeng calmed down. Indeed, if the opponent wanted to kill her, they only needed to use that previous magic to attack her; it would be completely unstoppable. \"You, then are you willing to save my sister? Please, save my sister. She's the only family I have left. My sister's nature isn't bad; it's just that she was overly traumatized in the past, which is why she hates men.\"\n\nThe Two-Color Ice Sealing Orb vanished, and Nian Bing walked step by step towards Ruyi. He knew very well that Ruyi's life was now in his hands, and Rumeng would definitely not attack him again. \"I also don't want to kill, but your sister's temperament truly needs a lesson. Please, take off her upper clothing.\"\n\n\"What?! You, what do you want to do?\" Hearing this, Rumeng was instantly startled, standing in front of Nian Bing and watching him warily, her sword raised again. Looking at the skull mask on Nian Bing's face, a strong fear inevitably rose in her heart. She had always obeyed her sister's arrangements, having long developed a dependency, and Ruyi had cared for her meticulously. But now Ruyi was unconscious, and before her was a powerful enemy she couldn't oppose. She truly didn't know what to do.\n\nNian Bing frowned and said: \"Miss Rumeng, your sister has many wounds on her body right now. If you don't take off her clothes, how can I treat her? Don't worry, I have no interest in her body at all.\" He had seen many beauties; none of them, casually picked, could compare to Ruyi's looks, especially when compared to a peerless beauty like Feng Nü, Ruyi was merely a firefly's glow.\n\nHearing Nian Bing's words, Rumeng finally realized. She quickly moved out of Nian Bing's way, squatted down, and leaned Ruyi against herself. \"You, you're really willing to save my sister?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Of course. I have no grudge against you two. However, after your sister recovers, I hope you will persuade her more to no longer have the heart to disregard human life wantonly. Otherwise, the next time we meet, the 'kill' word of my Demonic Assassin will surely fall upon her head. Undress her.\" As he spoke, Nian Bing raised his Sunstone Blade, which he had been holding inverted in his left hand. The God of Flame Stone on the hilt directly touched Ruyi's forehead. What else could be more effective at removing the chilling poison than the God of Flame Stone? A scorching current flowed down from her brow under the influence of the fire element. Ruyi's originally pale face instantly gained a hint of redness.\n\nSeeing that Nian Bing was truly going to save her sister, Rumeng immediately sighed in relief. She put down her longsword, and with trembling hands, began to unfasten her sister's clothes.\n\nAfter the outer long skirt was unfastened, there was the inner robe, and after the inner robe, the undergarments. Item by item, it was extremely troublesome, leaving Nian Bing dumbfounded. He muttered: \"Girls are really troublesome! Miss Rumeng, you'd better hurry, otherwise, if the chilling poison doesn't kill her, but she dies from excessive blood loss, then I'll be helpless.\"\n\nHearing this, Rumeng's hands no longer trembled, and she quickly removed the obstacles on her sister's body. Once everything was removed, Nian Bing was briefly stunned. He had to admit that Miss Ruyi, with her Swordsman-level strength, indeed had a perfect figure. This was his first time seeing a girl's body, and he couldn't help but feel a little parched. Fortunately, he was wearing a mask; otherwise, if Rumeng saw his flushed face, she wouldn't know what to think. Taking a deep breath, Nian Bing barely managed to calm his agitated feelings, pushing the undulating peaks before his eyes out of his mind. He swallowed, pressed his hands virtually towards Ruyi's delicate body, and chanted a spell he was familiar with. After several months of study at the Mage Guild, he was no longer the Nian Bing who was unfamiliar with Ice-attribute spells. \"Great Ice Elementals! I request that you, with hearts of kindness, melt into water, transform into sacred sweet springs, soothe wounds, and appear, under the witness of the Water Goddess, the source of healing, Holy Water Spell!\"",

    "content": "A soft blue light condensed towards Nianbing's hands as the incantation was completed. In an instant, his hands turned completely jade-like white. His hands trembled like waves, pressing down without contact, and streams of white halos drifted towards Ruyi's fair and full delicate body. Over ten wounds of varying depths immediately stopped bleeding under the effect of the white light. Nianbing closed his eyes, letting the gentle water elements flow at his fingertips. When he felt the Holy Water Technique fully formed, his hands moved. His hands, moving in a rhythmic motion, pointed at the wounds on Ruyi's body. Milky white water light replaced the fresh red of the wounds. The viscous holy water completely sealed off those shocking wounds. Soon, the milky white liquid completely merged into the wounds, and one could almost see with the naked eye that the wounds of varying depths were continuously healing.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Nianbing felt a little tired. After all, he had continuously used several powerful spells, which consumed a lot of his magic power. \"It's done. Help your sister put her clothes on. Don't move her body for now; let the holy water completely merge with the wounds. You can take her back in about half a *shichen*¹ later. Don't worry. The Holy Water Technique I used is a fifth-tier healing magic, originally used to treat internal injuries. For ordinary external wounds like these, the Holy Water Technique is a luxury, but it won't leave scars. Let her get a good night's sleep; everything will be restored when she wakes up tomorrow.\"\n\nUpon hearing that not even scars would be left, a look of gratitude immediately appeared in Rumeng's eyes. Only then did she fully believe that Nianbing had no intention of harming them. \"Mage Assassin Sir, thank you. I thank you on my sister's behalf. If there's ever a chance in the future, I will definitely repay you.\"\n\nNianbing said, a little amused, \"What's there to thank me for? Don't forget, your sister was injured by me. I hope she learns her lesson. Miss Rumeng, what kind of trauma did your sister suffer previously?\"\n\nRumeng hesitated for a moment, but when she saw Nianbing's clear gaze projected through his mask, a strong sense of trust surged within her for no apparent reason. She sighed softly and said, \"It's like this. Our parents passed away due to a plague when my sister was seven and I was five. When we were little, my sister was very strong. To take care of me, she begged for food on the streets every day. Back then, she was like a boy; none of the other young beggars our age dared to bully us. My sister was always fierce towards outsiders. Until my sister was ten, we were taken in by our benefactor. Our benefactor ensured we had food and clothing and taught us skills. This gave us a chance to make something of ourselves. Mage Assassin Sir, please don't ask which faction we belong to; my sister and I would never betray our benefactor, even if it meant death.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly and said, \"I'm not interested in any of that. I just want to know what kind of trauma your sister experienced that made her so hysterical.\"\n\nA glint of tears appeared in Rumeng's eyes, \"Among the orphans taken in by our benefactor, there was an exceptionally outstanding boy. He was very handsome and gentle in nature. His abilities were clear for all to see; at twenty years old, he had already reached the Great Swordsman realm, an unprecedented feat. At that time, we used to say that one day, he would surely become a Martial Saint of his generation. I was fifteen then, and my sister was seventeen. At some point, my sister had already secretly fallen in love with him but never dared to confess, burying her love in her heart. Because my sister knew he liked the benefactor's daughter; although the benefactor's daughter only returned once a year, he was always happiest then. My sister knew she couldn't compare to the benefactor's daughter, so she could only bury her feelings in her heart. Finally, two years ago, the benefactor's daughter returned home again. The outstanding boy could no longer bear it and confessed to the benefactor's daughter. However, what he received was a rejection, a merciless rejection, a rejection with no room for reconsideration. At that time, he was greatly distressed and ran off to drink alone. As the saying goes, 'concern makes one lose composure,' my sister chased after him. That night, neither of them returned. Although my sister didn't say anything, I could guess what happened between them. From then on, my sister's relationship with him was established. I was happy for my sister, but I always had an uneasy feeling. That year was the happiest year of my sister's life. They lived together, and when on missions, they were inseparable, 'flying side-by-side like a pair of birds'². My sister, besides not forgetting to take care of me, had no time for anything else. Seeing my sister so happy, I couldn't bear to say much, only secretly praying that my guess was wrong. However, things did not go as hoped. After they had been together for a full year, when the benefactor's daughter returned home again, the outstanding boy, astonishingly, cared for the benefactor's daughter with meticulous attention, just as he had before. Everything was exactly as it had been; the benefactor's daughter still paid him no mind. After the benefactor's daughter left, my sister and he had their first argument. I clearly remember they argued very fiercely that time. I was worried about my sister, so I listened from beneath their window. My sister questioned him, asking why he still couldn't forget the benefactor's daughter. He mercilessly hurt my sister. He told my sister that between him and her, there was only desire, no love; my sister was just a substitute for the benefactor's daughter, merely a temporary solace for his mood. He also said that in his entire life, he would only love the benefactor's daughter alone, and even if he truly united with my sister in the future, his love would forever be only for the benefactor's daughter. My sister is a strong person. From that moment on, her heart died. She didn't say much because he was someone the benefactor valued greatly, and the killing intent that had risen in my sister dissipated. However, my sister requested an external transfer from the benefactor and came here, using the identity of a prostitute to conceal herself while continuing to work for the benefactor. I think if it weren't to repay the benefactor, my sister would probably have had thoughts of suicide long ago. I've seen her crying alone in the dead of night, behind my back, more than once. My sister is truly suffering so much! Tonight, the friend you were protecting came to the brothel. She is truly handsome, even more handsome than the person my sister once deeply loved. His gentle smile somewhat resembled that person, which is why my sister's heart was stirred and why she tried to kill him. Mage Assassin Sir, I apologize to you and your friend on my sister's behalf. Please forgive her, considering her pitiable fate. In the future, I will definitely persuade her not to do foolish things again.\"\n\nAfter listening to Rumeng's narration, Nianbing's heart trembled slightly. Everyone has their own experiences; compared to Ruyi and her sister, perhaps he was still more fortunate. His gaze fell upon Ruyi's still somewhat pale face; she no longer seemed so detestable. The last trace of resentment in his heart completely vanished. Nianbing sighed softly and said, \"I'm sorry, Miss Rumeng, I didn't know your sister had experienced so many hardships. It should be me apologizing to her. I sincerely wish her to find a good home in the future. However, please also tell your sister that handsome men aren't necessarily all bad. At least, my friend isn't. All right, take your sister back now; I'll escort you. Be careful from now on.\"\n\nRumeng carefully picked up her sister and, under Nianbing's escort, returned to the city. Nianbing only quietly left after seeing them all the way back to the brothel. By then, a streak of 'fish-belly white' had appeared in the distant sky. Not rushing back to the restaurant, Nianbing found a quiet corner, put away his Mage Assassin attire, sat cross-legged, and projected his spiritual power outwards. He slowly recovered his magic power while simultaneously perceiving everything around him. Although this method of recovery was a bit slower, because he could sense surrounding events beforehand by projecting his spiritual power, it was relatively much safer.\n\nWhen Nianbing sensed that the streets were already bustling with people, he woke up from his meditation. The unique nature of his Ice and Fire Homology made his magic power recover extremely quickly; he had now returned to his optimal state. He stood up, dusted off his clothes. It was time to go back. He believed Ruyi must have woken up by now, wondering how her body was. After injuring someone with magic for the first time, Nianbing felt a little guilty. He still felt great sympathy for Ruyi's plight, as he too had similar unfortunate experiences.\n\nWalking onto the street, Nianbing oriented himself and headed towards the inn. He wasn't in a hurry; the little he'd eaten last night had mostly digested. He decided to find a place to fill his stomach first. Let Xuejing wait; the worse her impression of him, the less likely she'd bother him again. Thinking of this, he simply slowed his pace. There were quite a few places selling breakfast, but after just a few glances, Nianbing noticed that the craftsmanship of the chefs in these breakfast stalls was truly unimpressive. Still, he could only make do with eating something for now. He randomly found a relatively clean breakfast stall and sat down, ordering a bowl of plain congee, two steamed buns, and a dish of pickles. These basic foods wouldn't taste too bad.\n\nWhile eating the food he had ordered, Nianbing looked out at the street. He suddenly noticed that across the street from the breakfast stall was a shop selling kitchenware. His heart stirred, and he secretly thought: 'I now have a spatial ring; I don't need to carry everything on me anymore. Since that's the case, why not buy some kitchenware and put it in the spatial ring?' Having only a cleaver isn't enough, after all; besides grilling, I can't effectively cook anything. 'Yes, I'll buy some kitchenware. I'll also pick up some seasonings while I'm at it; that way, it'll be much more convenient to carry them around.' Thinking this, he quickened his eating, and after filling his stomach, he immediately crossed the street and entered the kitchenware shop.\n\nThe kitchenware shop looked very clean, with various kitchen tools hanging neatly categorized on the walls, fully stocked. Although they weren't top-grade items, they were sufficient for general cooking. A short man in his forties came forward and said, \"Sir, are you looking to buy kitchenware? We have everything here, please feel free to choose.\"\n\nNianbing casually picked up an iron pot, tapped it with his finger, producing a clear sound. He then examined the texture of the iron pot and couldn't help but shake his head. The quality was too poor; he feared that if he used his fire magic even a little stronger, this pot would be destroyed. The short man, seeing Nianbing's dissatisfaction, quickly said, \"Sir, if these ordinary goods don't catch your eye, I have better ones here.\"\n\n\"Oh? Good, bring them out for me to see. A complete set would be best, saving me the trouble of picking them out one by one.\" Nianbing didn't hold out much hope, only needing the kitchenware to have better rigidity and toughness, enough to withstand his Ice and Fire Homology magic, and that would be sufficient. The short man said, \"What a coincidence! I happen to have a genuine set of renowned kitchenware from Heavenly Spring Pavilion here. Please wait a moment.\"\n\nHeavenly Spring Pavilion? Nianbing had heard this name before from Ghost Chef Zhaji. In Zhaji's description, Heavenly Spring Pavilion was one of the best kitchenware workshops today. The kitchenware they produced had characteristics such as high hardness, good rigidity, wear resistance, and corrosion prevention. Although not 'renowned artifacts,' they were rare and excellent kitchen tools. Generally, good chefs mostly used kitchenware produced there. Because Heavenly Spring Pavilion was extremely famous, the prices of their kitchenware were quite outrageous. Any single piece would cost several gold coins, and a full set would likely cost several purple gold coins. Ordinary kitchenware only needed two or three silver coins for a set; the price difference was a full hundredfold. However, Nianbing didn't care about money. If the owner here could truly produce good items from Heavenly Spring Pavilion, he wouldn't be stingy. As the saying goes, 'If a craftsman wants to do his work well, he must first sharpen his tools.' For a chef, the better the tools, the more they can unleash their full abilities in cooking.\n\nIn a moment, the short man emerged carrying a stack of boxes taller than himself, seemingly struggling. He placed the boxes on the ground and said, somewhat breathlessly, \"Sir, please look. These are all excellent items produced by Heavenly Spring Pavilion! Although the price is higher, they are absolutely worth it.\"\n\nNianbing stepped forward with some curiosity and opened the top box. Inside, he saw an iron pot. Its body was entirely gray. Turning the pot over, he saw a diamond-shaped mark engraved on the bottom, with the three characters 'Heavenly Spring Pavilion' clearly visible. This pot was noticeably much heavier than the previous one, at least four times the weight of the earlier pot. The thickness of the pot body was also quite suitable. Gripping the handle, his wrist and the handle felt perfectly integrated, feeling extremely comfortable. His wrist trembled slightly as he performed a tossing motion with the pot; everything felt very natural and harmonious. This kind of heavy pot was exactly what Nianbing liked. Tapping the pot body lightly, the iron quality was quite good, producing a rich echo when struck, which sounded very pleasant. \"Boss, is this really kitchenware produced by Heavenly Spring Pavilion?\" There was a hint of doubt in Nianbing's voice.\n\nThe owner was stunned for a moment, then said, \"Of course it is! This is a treasure of my shop that I specially procured from Heavenly Spring Pavilion. If I didn't see that you know your kitchenware, I wouldn't have brought it out.\"\n\n---\n¹ *Shichen* (時辰): A traditional Chinese unit of time, equivalent to two hours.

    "content": "Nian Bing glanced at him and asked, \"How much does one pot sell for?\"\n\nThe boss tentatively said, \"Originally, this pot should sell for one gold coin. However, seeing as you seem interested in buying, I'll give you half price: five silver coins. Isn't that cheap enough?\"\n\nNian Bing placed the iron pot into the box and calmly said, \"Then you should keep this treasure of your shop.\" After speaking, he walked out without looking back.\n\n\"Ah! Sir, sir, don't leave! The price is negotiable, please make an offer.\" The boss hastily called out to Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing turned back to look at him and said, \"If it's a complete set of kitchenware, I'll offer one gold coin for the total. Sell if you want, if not, forget it. This is clearly fake goods, not Tianquan Xuan's stuff at all.\"\n\nThe boss said, dumbfounded, \"Sir, you can't just say things like that. How do you know this is fake?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"The material. Things produced by Tianquan Xuan are a bit darker in color than this, and also a bit heavier. Moreover, the mark is slightly off. The Tianquan Xuan logo should be a triangle. For this entire set, one gold coin is already a very high price from me. If I'm not mistaken, you probably acquired this at a low price from somewhere, didn't you?\"\n\nThe boss said with a bitter face, \"Sir, even if it's fake, for so many items, one gold coin is still too little, isn't it?\"\n\nNian Bing snorted, \"Too little? Then find another buyer. For fake goods like these, I'd at most give eight silver coins elsewhere.\" After saying that, he made a move to leave again.\n\n\"Alright, alright, alright, you're my first customer today anyway. I'll sell it to you for one gold coin. Oh, I'm losing money on this.\" The boss made a concession with an unwilling expression.\n\nNian Bing took out a gold coin and handed it to the boss, then picked up the stack of kitchenware and left the shop. Watching his retreating back, the short boss snorted. He muttered to himself, \"What an idiot, buying it even though he knew it was fake. I only bought it for three silver coins. Hmm, I made a good profit on this. Hahahaha.\" You know, one gold coin was enough for a family of three to live for a month.\n\nLeaving the shop, Nian Bing was also celebrating silently, \"What an idiot.\" It was clearly genuine, yet sold as fake. This time, he made a huge profit. These Tianquan Xuan kitchenware items were not fake. The reason he dared to bargain with the boss was mainly because of the boss's asking price. Even at cost price, Tianquan Xuan's items would never be less than one gold coin each, yet the boss wanted to sell him a pot for five silver coins. Recalling that Ice Orchid City was a commercial city, he easily deduced that this set of Tianquan Xuan kitchenware must have been acquired by the boss from someone who didn't know their value. Tianquan Xuan was located in the Huarong Empire, and it was difficult for ordinary people to see their products. Realizing the boss didn't know his merchandise, Nian Bing naturally pushed the price down.\n\nFinding a secluded spot, Nian Bing inspected each piece of kitchenware and stored them in his spatial ring. This time, even if he had to camp outdoors again, he wouldn't fear not having tools to cook with. On his way back to the inn, he also collected various seasonings he needed. Inside his spatial ring, apart from his precious knives, it was practically a mobile kitchen.\n\n\"Jing Jing, are you awake?\" Nian Bing returned to the inn. It was already daytime now, so naturally there were no guards to stop him, and he went straight up to his room on the upper floor.\n\nThe door opened, and Xue Jing appeared before Nian Bing with a displeased expression. \"Where did you go last night?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"I was just sleeping on the sofa in the lobby!\"\n\nXue Jing snorted, \"Still lying. After I returned yesterday, I took a quilt down for you, but you were gone. Where did you actually go?\" As she spoke, she pulled Nian Bing into the room. Hearing Xue Jing's words, Nian Bing's heart warmed slightly, but thinking of his future freedom, he hardened his resolve and said, \"I just found a random place to stay for the night.\"\n\nXue Jing frowned and said, \"It was that late, and there would still be places to stay? Confess quickly, where did you actually go?\" Eager to question Nian Bing about his whereabouts last night, she didn't even close the door.\n\n\"A brothel. Is that satisfactory? Don't you think you're annoying?\" Nian Bing feigned impatience.\n\n\"What?\" Xue Jing's voice suddenly became sharp. \"You, you say that again. Where did you go?\"\n\n\"A brothel! What's wrong? It's quite comfortable to sleep there.\" Nian Bing put on an indifferent air.\n\nXue Jing's originally rosy complexion immediately turned somewhat pale. She raised a finger, pointing at Nian Bing. \"You, you actually went to a place like that, you, you...\"\n\nNian Bing calmly said, \"Where I go is my freedom. Although we are friends, you don't have the power to restrict my freedom. I'm also a man, isn't it normal to go to a brothel?\"\n\nXue Jing's voice trembled. \"Fine, fine, you Nian Bing, I came all this way to chase after you, and you treat me like this?\"\n\nNian Bing blinked. \"It's not that exaggerated, a thousand *li*¹. Jing Jing, I said this is my own business. I'm only telling you the truth because I consider you a friend.\"\n\nAnger caused Xue Jing's pale, pretty face to flush crimson. \"Last night I asked you to stay with me, but you kept making excuses, and yet you went to a brothel. Why? Tell me why?\"\n\nNian Bing walked to a side and sat down. At this moment, he was also a bit nervous, unsure whether he should continue. He took a deep breath and said, \"It's simple. We are friends, and prostitutes don't require responsibility.\"\n\n\"You...\" *Clang*, a precious sword slid from its sheath. Xue Jing pointed at Nian Bing. \"In your eyes, am I even worse than a prostitute?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"No, Jing Jing, you need to understand that we have no other relationship besides being friends. I don't feel I've done anything wrong. This is the second time you've pointed a sword at me. I also want to ask you a question: What right do you have to interfere with my freedom? I've never claimed to be a noble gentleman, nor have I forced you to be with me. If you're dissatisfied, you can leave at any time. I imagine Uncle Xue is looking forward to your return.\"\n\n\"I'll kill you.\" Xue Jing had lost her rationality in her rage. Nian Bing had originally intended to use her fiery temper, but for some reason, he now felt a pang of unwillingness.\n\nThe sword, carrying a red aura of battle energy, lunged directly towards Nian Bing's chest. Xue Jing, consumed by anger, had long since cast aside all caution. Just as Nian Bing was about to activate his Ice Wall Scroll, a blue light, without warning, blocked in front of him. With a soft *clink*, Xue Jing's sword actually flew off, landing on a nearby wall. The blue light flashed, and a long sword rested on her shoulder, its presence completely locking Xue Jing, making her unable to move an inch.\n\nNian Bing looked at the person before him in surprise. \"President Carlo.\"\n\nThe person who arrived was indeed Carlo. His gaze fell upon Xue Jing, and he calmly said, \"Fire attribute battle energy. Drifting unsteadily like clouds, yet bursting forth like an overwhelming tide. This should be Fire Cloud Battle Energy. What is your relationship with Marshal Xue Po, the Blood-Devouring Soul-Destroyer?\"\n\nThe icy aura stimulated Xue Jing's body. She glared angrily at Carlo before her. \"None of your business. Get lost, I'm going to kill him.\"\n\nCarlo glanced at Nian Bing with some amusement. \"Arguing is one thing, but why resort to violence? Can you bear to kill him? If it's just a misunderstanding, clarify it. Young lady, matters of the heart can't be resolved by impulse.\" Being worldly-wise, he had already understood much from Xue Jing's eyes, which were filled with a mix of love and hate.\n\nXue Jing froze for a moment, then said angrily, \"Get lost! What misunderstanding? He himself admitted he went to a brothel. Is that still a misunderstanding? Let go of me, I'm going to kill him.\"\n\nNian Bing stood up and walked to Carlo's side. \"Jing Jing, calm down. I have my own life, and you also have yours. We don't belong to the same world. If what I did made you angry, then I'm willing to apologize to you. However, I will never change anything because of you, and at the same time, I don't want you to change because of me. President Carlo, please release her.\"\n\nThe sword light in Carlo's hand faded. The aura that had locked Xue Jing's body vanished. Nian Bing walked to the side, pulled the sword from the wall, and handed it to Xue Jing. \"I have a protective scroll on me, you can't hurt me. I'm sorry, Jing Jing, perhaps I've disappointed you, but this is my true nature. Rather than letting you get to know me later, it's better to make it clear now.\"\n\nTaking the sword Nian Bing offered, Xue Jing's hand trembled slightly. \"Why, why do you all treat me like this? What's wrong with me? Am I not worthy of you? As soon as I heard you left, I immediately came after you, and I was even willing to accompany you to the Aolan Empire. But what about you? What have you done? Are you worthy of my heart?\"\n\nNian Bing fell silent, thinking to himself: *I'm sorry, Jing Jing, I'm not trying to reject you, but I simply don't have the right to accept your love right now. My heart holds only hatred. For my parents' revenge, I cannot let anything distract me. Jing Jing, you will surely find a better home than me. I will always bless you.*\n\nIn Nian Bing's heart, the woman with the highest status was undoubtedly Fen Nü. Perhaps it was because Fen Nü was the first girl he had ever seen, or perhaps because Fen Nü was the most beautiful among all the women. In his heart, Fen Nü's status was almost unshakeable. Even so, Nian Bing had made no overtures to Fen Nü because he knew he wasn't worthy. Before avenging his parents, he had no right to seek his own love. Everything would have to wait until after the revenge, but he didn't even know how long that would be. Therefore, he didn't want to hurt any girl, choosing instead to evade and withdraw. Striving to improve his own abilities was what he pursued. Seeing Nian Bing's silence, Xue Jing's anger intensified. The battle energy on her sword flickered, indistinct. Yet, she, who always acted on her own impulses, simply couldn't bring herself to strike. It wasn't because of Carlo, whose depth was unfathomable, nor because of Nian Bing's hidden magic scrolls. Looking at the handsome man before her, although angry, for some unknown reason, an inexpressible feeling made her unable to steel herself to harm him.\n\nTears streamed down her face. Xue Jing violently threw her sword to the ground, letting her tears flow freely, and transformed into a wisp of red cloud, drifting away.\n\nThe person he had always wanted to get rid of was gone, but Nian Bing's heart grew heavier. *Jing Jing, travel safely. Return to Ice Snow City soon, that's where you belong.*\n\nCarlo stepped forward two paces, picked up the sword from the ground, examined it carefully, and said, \"A good sword. Fire attribute. It was forged from red steel using the Hundred Refinement Method. Using this sword can allow fire attribute battle energy to be better unleashed. A rare and excellent weapon! Mr. Mage, don't you think it's a bit of a waste?\"\n\nNian Bing sighed, took the sword into his hand, and said, \"It's already happened, there's nothing to regret or not regret. The sword is a good sword, but I am not a good person. Just call me Nian Bing.\"\n\nCarlo smiled slightly and said, \"This girl has a good appearance, and it's clear that although her temper is a bit fiery, her disposition is very good. Why must you keep people a thousand *li* away²?\"\n\n\"Did I? You also heard, she got angry because I went to a brothel last night. I wronged her, and her choice to leave is the most correct. How could someone like me be worthy of her love?\"\n\nCarlo's smile widened. \"I am decades older than you, and I have some accomplishments in the art of observing people. Although you appear gentle on the surface, deep down you possess a kind of pride that others don't. A person shouldn't be arrogant, but they must have integrity. I don't believe someone like you would go to a brothel to do meaningless things, am I right? If my guess isn't wrong, you seem to have forced that young lady away because you didn't want to involve her in certain matters.\"\n\n*Old fox.* This was Nian Bing's assessment of Carlo. \"These are my private matters, President Carlo, you needn't ask further. You came to find me, so you must have prepared those items, right?\"\n\nCarlo smiled slightly and said, \"Of course. I wonder if Mr. Nian Bing is ready? Bring them in.\" At his summons, a sturdy, tall man walked in from outside, carrying a cloth bag on his shoulder. Without even opening it, Nian Bing could already feel the magical aura emanating from the cloth package. \"Everything you asked for is here.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, glanced at the cloth package on the table, and with a sweep of his right hand through the air, seven magic scrolls immediately appeared in his hand. These magic scrolls were entirely made from the highest-grade white scrolls. \"President, you can take a look, but be careful not to accidentally activate them. I'll tell you later what magic these scrolls represent.\"\n\nSeeing that Nian Bing didn't look at the cloth bag he had brought, Carlo smiled faintly and said, \"Since you trust me, why wouldn't I trust you? Mr. Nian Bing, I'm very pleased to have completed our first transaction. If you have any more magical items to sell in the future, you are always welcome; price is not an issue.\"\n\n---\n¹ *Li*: A traditional Chinese unit of distance, roughly 500 meters or 0.3 miles. \"A thousand *li*\" implies a very long distance.\n² *Keep people a thousand li away*: An idiom meaning to keep a great distance from people, to be aloof, or to push people away.",

    "content": "Nianbing nodded: \"Since that's the case, then I won't see you off, President.\" He just wanted to be alone now and quiet.\n\nCarlo said: \"Mr. Nianbing, yesterday I heard you mention you had a few special magic scrolls you wanted to sell. I wonder what effects these magic scrolls have? If possible, I will offer a very reasonable price. Of course, that depends on the quality of the scrolls themselves.\"\n\nNianbing shook his head and said: \"I'm sorry, I don't want to sell those magic scrolls yet. Perhaps there will be a chance in the future. As you know, I don't actually lack money; I just need some raw materials for magical items.\"\n\nCarlo said nothing more, smiling faintly: \"I hope our guild can cooperate happily with your master. After leaving here, I will immediately rush to Ice Snow City.\"\n\nNianbing's heart stirred, and he said: \"President Carlo, if you encounter that girl from just now on your way to Ice Snow City, please trouble yourself to look after her for me. Nianbing will certainly repay you in the future.\"\n\nCarlo nodded. He could see that Nianbing was in a bad mood, so he said nothing more and left the room with his subordinates.\n\nXue Jing was gone, and he had also obtained the blank scrolls he wanted. Everything seemed to be going smoothly, but Nianbing felt a bit choked up inside. He opened his cloth bag, displaying the blank scrolls before him. What to do when in a bad mood? Having something to distract himself would naturally be the best method. Currently, making scrolls was the best option. Only by transforming each blank scroll into something he needed could he better survive on this continent.\n\nMaking scrolls once more, Nianbing set high demands for himself. Single magic scrolls were no longer what he pursued. Although the highest was still Tier 6, this time, he incorporated many of his own ideas into various scrolls.\n\nThree days, three full days. Nianbing did not leave his room for a single step. All his food and drink were delivered to his room by the hotel staff. On the first day, he was still a bit depressed, but from the second day onwards, he had forgotten all his worries and completely immersed himself in the creation of magic scrolls.\n\nThe more complex the scroll, the harder it was to make. Similarly, the success rate was also lower. Even with his profound magic control, the success rate for some magic scrolls with special effects was less than one-third.\n\nThree days passed. Nianbing looked at the more than twenty successfully completed scrolls before him. A faint smile appeared on his somewhat pale face. Although only a little over twenty magic scrolls were made from the numerous blank scrolls, he was confident that any single one of these finished products before him could rival the price of all the previous blank scrolls combined.\n\nHe carefully placed these scrolls into his Spatial Ring. Then he took out a few and wore them on himself. It was done; what he needed was complete. It was time to set off. The Olan Empire was his next destination. Before going to the Olan Empire, he still had one thing to do: pursue another one of his dreams. Or rather, pursue one for his master, Chaji. The famous snack \"Staring Food\" in Ice Orchid City was his last stop before leaving.\n\nAfter settling the bill, Nianbing quietly left the Lanxin Hotel. As he passed the Lanxin Restaurant, he clearly saw that several new types of chicken wings had been added to the menu, entirely based on the chicken wings he had made that day. Although it was imaginable that these chicken wings, made by ordinary chefs, would certainly not compare to his own, they were clearly much stronger than the original ones. This could also be considered his small contribution to the city. He just hoped that \"Staring Food\" would not disappoint him.\n\nAs he thought, Nianbing walked down the street towards the south of the city. The streets were still as boisterous and lively as ever, with various merchant caravans visible everywhere. Horse-drawn carriages loaded with goods often blocked traffic by cutting across the street. Whenever this happened, officials from Ice Orchid City would come to help alleviate the traffic situation. Everything was operating in an orderly manner, and this commercial city continued to run smoothly. Nianbing looked at everything around him, secretly telling himself that the next time he passed through Ice Orchid City to enter the Ice Moon Empire, it might be the moment he went to the Ice God Pagoda to avenge his parents.\n\nWith a faint smile, Nianbing walked forward. He didn't know how long he would walk. Having confirmed his direction, the South City would eventually end.\n\nWhen Nianbing arrived in the South City, he was a bit out of breath. He really wanted to shout, \"I hate big cities! Why do I have to walk so far?\" He then asked for the exact location of the \"Staring Food Restaurant\" along the way and finally found his destination.\n\nThe storefront's decor was much better than Lanxin Restaurant's. However, this seemed to be an open-air establishment. In the center of the entrance archway was a huge sign: a large, oval-shaped eye, about one square meter in size, hanging there and extremely eye-catching. On either side of the large eye were two big characters: \"Staring\" and \"Eye.\"\n\n\"So distinctive!\" This was Nianbing's first impression. When he walked through the gate, this feeling became even stronger. It was his first time seeing such a restaurant. What appeared before him was actually a huge courtyard, a courtyard without a roof. Tables were sparsely arranged. As long as there were customers, a large pot would be placed on the table. Regardless of the number of customers, a server would stand by the table, watching, while the customers' gazes all fell into the pot. It truly fit the words \"staring eye.\" But why did they do this?\n\n\"Sir, are you here to eat Staring Food?\" A waiter ran up.\n\nNianbing nodded and said: \"It's my first time here. Can you introduce it to me first?\"\n\nThe waiter smiled faintly and said: \"It's actually very simple. Our pot contains special seasonings, slowly simmered over a long time to create an aged broth. When eating, you dilute it with boiling water, then add ingredients like liver, intestines, tripe, lungs, tofu, vegetables, and some high-end items. The best is abalone; there's only one abalone per pot. As long as you can pick it up, we'll add another. Then, with the stove fire heating it from below, the various ingredients in the pot will churn with the boiling water. For every silver coin, customers can dip their chopsticks ten times. You cannot leave your chopsticks in the boiling water. Whatever you pick up, you eat. We also provide flatbread and soup broth for free. If you're lucky, you'll naturally eat good things. If you're unlucky, it's possible to eat vegetables ten times in a row.\"\n\nNianbing looked at the waiter in surprise and said: \"This is indeed very novel. Then give me a pot; I'll try it.\" Led by the waiter, he came to an empty table and sat down. In a moment, the waiter first brought a brazier with fire, then placed a large pot on top of the fire to heat.\n\nThe soup in the pot was brownish-yellow, and wafts of fragrance assaulted his nostrils. From the scent, Nianbing deduced that there must be medicinal herbs in the soup base. Were medicinal cuisine popular now even in the Ice Moon Empire?\n\nThe soup in the pot gradually began to churn. Nianbing picked up a flatbread with his left hand and chopsticks with his right, carefully watching the various ingredients churning in the broth. There was a lot of soup, but relatively few ingredients inside. The stove fire below was quite hot, no wonder they had to eat outdoors. If they were indoors, with so many braziers, simply the temperature issue would be difficult to resolve. Staring Food, it seemed he really had to keep his eyes wide open.\n\nWhen it came to eyesight and hand accuracy, even martial arts masters would probably find it hard to compare with Nianbing. With a flick of his wrist, his chopsticks darted in and out like lightning, and the only small abalone in the pot was picked up by him. Ignoring the waiter's astonished look, Nianbing blew the heat off the abalone and put it into his mouth to chew.\n\nThe taste wasn't as good as he'd imagined, but it was still acceptable. Nianbing immediately concluded that the main reason \"Staring Food\" could attract and draw customers was its novelty. In terms of actual taste, it was only mediocre. The medicinal herb flavor in the broth hadn't been fully absorbed by the ingredients, and because they were pre-cooked, the cooking temperature control was average, and the freshness of the abalone had already somewhat diminished.\n\nWhen Nianbing picked up the eighth abalone and brought it to his mouth, the waiter's face was already extremely unsightly. As expected of \"Staring Food,\" his eyes were already wide open, but he still couldn't see how Nianbing moved his chopsticks or how he found those precious abalones among the many ingredients. One must know that every time he put in an abalone, he would stir all the ingredients, and abalones were very slippery in the soup, making them extremely difficult to pick up, let alone instantly.\n\nFortunately, Nianbing's last two attempts only picked up a vegetable leaf and a piece of meat. Otherwise, his \"Staring Food\" would have turned into a ten-abalone feast. Drinking a bowl of soup and swallowing the flatbread, Nianbing exhaled with relative satisfaction and said to the waiter beside him: \"The soup tastes better than the ingredients. This is a good dish in itself, but unfortunately, this way of eating makes it impossible to control the cooking temperature, so it naturally falls a bit short. Here's a suggestion for you: it's best to add some ginger slices to the soup. Not only will it have the effect of expelling cold, but the taste will also be better.\"\n\nAfter speaking, he ignored the waiter's astonished gaze, placed a silver coin on the table, and got up to leave.\n\nAlthough \"Staring Food\" didn't bring Nianbing much surprise, this novel way of eating still gave him some insight.\n\nOutside the city, Nianbing took a deep breath. Compared to the murky air in the city, the wilderness was much fresher. The bright sun hung high in the sky; it was almost noon. Having tasted a meal of \"Staring Food,\" he was now in excellent spirits. Target: Olan Empire's capital. Onward.\n\nNot far after entering the Olan Empire's territory, Nianbing suddenly felt a chilling aura. The aura was very profound. The surrounding forest seemed very quiet, as if even the chirping of insects and birds was absent.\n\nUnder what circumstances would such a feeling appear? His heart tightened slightly, and he already knew the answer. An army. Only near an army's encampment could such a situation occur. Moreover, the army here must have been tested by iron and blood to exude such a strong killing intent. It seemed the border between the Olan Empire and the Ice Moon Empire was not as peaceful as imagined! As he pondered, the sound of horse hooves came from ahead. As the sound of hooves grew clearer, Nianbing saw a cloud of dust rising in the distance on the main road. The dust was very straight, moving along the main road. Was that cavalry? Thinking of the word \"cavalry,\" Nianbing couldn't help but recall that day over eight years ago, his first time traveling to Ice Snow City with his master. The Silver Feather Knight Brigade had left a deep impression on him, especially the aunt he had come to regard as a mother; she was so kind, truly like a mother!\n\nThe dust cloud drew closer and closer. Nianbing saw that it was a cavalry troop, neatly arranged. There were only ten riders in total, lined up in a row, all wearing black armor. Although it wasn't heavy plate armor, it looked somewhat weighty. They were galloping rapidly towards him. The knights on horseback were all spirited, none wearing helmets. The straight line of dust rose from beneath their warhorses' hooves. Ten riders in a line, with not a trace of scattered dust. Even their riding postures were identical. Clearly, this was a highly trained unit.\n\nNianbing stepped aside. He didn't want these cavalrymen to misunderstand anything. Since the day he left Ice Snow City, he had told himself to avoid trouble whenever possible. Fewer troubles meant he could better achieve his goals.\n\nIf you don't provoke others, will others not provoke you? Not necessarily.\n\n\"Halt!\" The leading knight suddenly bellowed. The front hooves of the ten warhorses simultaneously reared high, then dropped to the side. They, who had been galloping, came to an abrupt stop not far in front of Nianbing. The leading knight had long, fiery red hair and was much taller than Nianbing. Because of the horse's sudden stop, his armor clanked. He dismounted and walked towards Nianbing.\n\n\"Young brother, how much further is it to Ice Orchid City?\" The knight's voice was quite courteous.\n\nNianbing said: \"Not far. Following the main road, at your riding speed, you'll arrive in about half an hour.\"\n\nThe knight's gaze towards Nianbing suddenly grew somewhat suspicious. \"Were you just coming from over there? Someone from the Ice Moon Empire?\"\n\nNianbing shook his head. Of course, he couldn't confirm the other party's statement. There were no people with golden hair in the Ice Moon Empire. \"No, I am from the Huarong Empire. If there's nothing else, I need to continue my journey.\"\n\nUpon hearing the words \"Huarong Empire,\" the knight's expression changed. \"From the Huarong Empire? Then you don't need to go. Come back to Ice Orchid City with us.\"\n\nNianbing was slightly stunned and said: \"Why?\"\n\nThe knight snorted coldly and said: \"I am Aomu, a Squadron Leader of the Ironblood Knight Brigade from the Ice Moon Empire. The Huarong Empire has suddenly allied with the Qilu Empire and launched an attack on the Olan Empire. We are returning to the Empire to deliver news. At this time, you suddenly appear at the border between our two nations, and you are from the Huarong Empire. You must come with us. If it's confirmed that you have no involvement, we will then release you.\"\n\nNianbing frowned and said: \"But I don't know anything about a war. From what you're saying, it seems the war hasn't been going on for long, has it? I was far away in the Ice Moon Empire, how could I have known? And I'm certainly not the spy you imagine.\"",

    "content": "\"Is that so? Regardless, better to kill a thousand by mistake than let one slip away. First, come back with us to Ice Orchid City. If it's found that you are indeed not a spy, we will not trouble you.\"\n\nNian Bing said indifferently, \"Go back with you? Let you put me under house arrest? Sorry, I have things to do and must hurry. If you insist on taking me, please look at this first.\" As he spoke, he raised his right hand, and the emblem of the Magician's Guild appeared in his palm.\n\nThe knight, seeing the emblem Nian Bing produced, couldn't help but be startled. \"Magician? You are a Magician?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"To be precise, I am a Magician from the Ice Moon Empire's Magician's Guild. I believe this token represents everything, doesn't it?\"\n\nThe knight hesitated, then shook his head and said, \"We've been away from the Empire for some time. Who knows where your emblem came from? Please come with us to verify the authenticity of your emblem first.\"\n\nA hint of coldness entered Nian Bing's eyes. \"So, you are determined to take me back to Ice Orchid City? A Magician's dignity cannot be blasphemed. I'm sorry, I cannot go back with you.\"\n\nThe knight laughed. \"Magician? You're just a Magician from the Magician's Guild. Do you think your status is very noble? Perhaps in other empires, but in the Ice Moon Empire, your Magician's Guild is merely a subordinate. Unless you have the Ice God Tower's insignia, even if your guild master were here, he would still have to come with us.\"\n\nHearing this, Nian Bing finally understood why Long Zhi had compromised with him back then; the status of the Ice Moon Empire's Magician's Guild was unexpectedly low. Even a knight squadron leader like this looked down on them, so how could those dignitaries and nobles have a good attitude towards the Guild? Actually, it was also the knight's fault for not looking carefully. If he had recognized that Nian Bing was holding an Elder's emblem, he would never have been so arrogant. An Elder represented a Master Magician, while he was merely a Swordsman. Challenging a Master Magician, wasn't that courting death?\n\n\"Insulting a Magician is a shameful act. You will pay the price.\" For the first time, Nian Bing simultaneously produced the Morning Dew Blade and Zheng Xu, holding them by their hilts. The two peerless divine blades were now meant to display their second function, so they should rightfully be called the Goddess of Ice and Snow's Sigh and the God of Flame's Roar.\n\nThe knight snorted coldly, shifted his feet, and though clad in armor, his speed was not slow at all, moving directly to seize Nian Bing.\n\nA fist-sized fireball shot forth from the God of Flame's Roar, its fiery glow flashing as it directly met the knight's outstretched hand. An instant first-tier spell was nothing to Nian Bing, and to this knight, a first-tier spell couldn't break his defense at all. However, was Nian Bing's attack truly that simple? The answer was no. When the fireball appeared, the Goddess of Ice and Snow's Sigh in his right hand simultaneously materialized an ice spike. Due to its distinctive shape, the ice spike was more conducive to flight, arriving later but striking first. The moment the fireball touched the knight's palm, it instantly collided with the ice spike.\n\n\"Boom—\" A deafening roar was accompanied by a piercing scream. The knight, who had believed victory was certain, lost his right hand. Along with his armor, it was blasted to ashes. The baptism of ice and fire forced him to stagger back several steps, landing on his backside, his entire body convulsing.\n\nIn recent days, Nian Bing had primarily interacted with warriors. He had been pondering how he could contend with close-combat-proficient warriors. Magic scrolls were, of course, the best choice, but scrolls were limited. What would happen when he eventually lost the protection of his scrolls? Therefore, he began to research magic. From the day he left Ice Snow City, he had devised a good method: fully utilizing Ice-Fire Homology. The foundation of Ice-Fire Homology was the balance of ice and fire. The two spells cast had to possess equal energy to produce an explosive effect. Nian Bing deeply understood this, so balancing the power of the two spells when casting Ice-Fire Homology was his greatest headache. After separating from Mao Mao, Nian Bing suddenly realized something: Must magic pursue higher tiers to unleash powerful effects? No, that was not absolute. Since he possessed the special ability of Ice-Fire Homology, if he could unleash this ability with low-tier spells, the effect would be just as potent.\n\nFrom that day on, Nian Bing continuously experimented. Through his experiments, he discovered that low-tier spells produced the Ice-Fire Homology effect much more easily than high-tier spells. Especially in his current situation, simultaneously using the Goddess of Ice and Snow's Sigh and the God of Flame's Roar required only one first-tier spell from each, as they were inherently in a state of balance. When these two first-tier spells collided, they could unleash power no less than a third-tier Explosive Flame Spell. This kind of bombardment might not be much for a martial arts master, but it was more than enough to deal with a Swordsman, especially when the opponent underestimated him. What was most terrifying was that after his research succeeded, Nian Bing began to ponder the inherent characteristics of ice and fire that Long Zhi had spoken of. Just as in cooking, one must fully bring out the intrinsic flavors of the food, Ice-Fire Homology magic also needed to fully embody the essence of ice and fire. Only then would it be the true power of Ice-Fire Homology.\n\nMao Mao's father, Xilade, had also given Nian Bing such advice. Awakened by his insight, Nian Bing no longer pursued grand magic but instead developed small-scale magic. Only by starting small could grand magic unleash even greater power once small-scale magic fully released the power of Ice-Fire Homology. Therefore, in these days, he rarely practiced using Ice-Fire Homology; instead, he cultivated one type of magic individually, fully comprehending their characteristics.\n\nThat day, the first casualty of Nian Bing's research was Ruyi. At that time, to conceal his identity, Nian Bing only used ice magic. In the past, his Blizzard, though still capable of injuring Ruyi, would absolutely not have been fatal. But that day was different; the Blizzard fully showcased the characteristics of ice. Its powerful ice-elemental ability directly forced cold poison into Ruyi's body, almost taking her life.\n\nAnd today was Nian Bing's first experiment with the perfected first-tier Ice-Fire Homology. The explosive force shattered the knight's hand. In an instant, two extreme energies, ice and fire, simultaneously entered the knight's body under Nian Bing's powerful mental control. Whether ice came first then fire, or fire first then ice, that sensation would certainly not be pleasant. The two extreme energies merged, becoming far more terrifying than either one alone. The squadron leader's body was being alternately permeated by ice poison and fire poison. Although only one hand was blasted off, he had already lost the ability to fight again. From this strike, Nian Bing finally truly stepped through the gate of Ice-Fire Homology.\n\nSeeing their captain injured, the remaining nine knights charged forward simultaneously. Although they did not possess the strength of Swordsmen, as warriors of the Iron Blood Knights, one of the Ice Moon Empire's ace knight regiments, they also possessed the abilities of high-level warriors. Especially their coordination, refined through years of training and living, was already seamlessly harmonious.\n\nNine swords simultaneously attacked Nian Bing. Although they had not yet reached the level of externalizing their aura, nine high-level warriors attacking at once, combined with their coordinated battle formation, meant that even a Great Swordsman would absolutely be unable to overcome them in a short time.\n\nUnfortunately, these nine high-level warriors had not encountered a warrior. Battles between warriors could never compare to battles between Magicians and warriors.\n\nThe magical power consumed by a first-tier spell was very minimal for a Great Magician. At the same time, the greatest advantage of spells that required no chanting was that they could be cast continuously. Dozens of fireballs, like a volley of cannonballs, continuously flew out after being amplified by the God of Flame's Roar.\n\nThe top-tier fire-elemental gem was not meant to save Nian Bing magical power; rather, using it to cast spells could make the spells more cohesive and increase their attack power.\n\nJust as a first-tier Fireball Spell couldn't overcome the Swordsman squadron leader earlier, they also couldn't overcome these high-level warriors in front of him. However, when large numbers of ice spikes followed the first-tier fireballs, everything would change.\n\nAs the instigator, Nian Bing clearly controlled the changes in each fireball and ice spike. If it were someone unfamiliar with magic, they might assume that an Ice-Fire Homology Magician was, at most, equivalent to an ice-elemental Magician of the same level plus a fire-elemental Magician of the same level, but this was absolutely incorrect.\n\nWhat would happen if an ice-elemental Magician encountered a fire-elemental Magician, and they each released a first-tier spell with the same magical power, colliding with each other?\n\nVery simple: the two spells would cancel each other out due to their opposing extremes. However, the greatest characteristic of an Ice-Fire Homology Magician was the ability to change this situation. Under the control of mental power, fully sensing the two spells he unleashed, he could make any alteration occur. And what Nian Bing had to do now was destruction.\n\nDozens of loud bangs raised countless plumes of smoke. The warhorses, startled, ran to the side. It had to be admitted that these well-trained warhorses were of extremely high quality; though frightened, they did not run far. Unfortunately, their masters would never ride them again. Blood and severed limbs outlined a tragic picture. Not a single one of the nine high-level warriors, nine Iron Blood Knights, would see the sun of the next day.\n\nNian Bing closed his eyes. He had never been afraid of killing. From the first time he used ice-fire magic to destroy Liao San, killing had been merely a process of release for him. However, the scene before him was still too bloody.\n\nAlthough he had no intention of leaving anyone alive when he simultaneously drew out the two peerless divine blades, his heart still felt heavy now.\n\nTurning around, he faced the twisted face, contorted either by pain or by the death of his companions, and said faintly, \"Why force my hand? Now, do you still think Magicians are useless? Now, will you still look down on the Ice Moon Empire's Magician's Guild?\"\n\n\"No, no, you—you are a demon?\"\n\nAs a knight squadron leader, his psychological fortitude should not have been so poor. However, everything that had transpired before him made it difficult for him to comprehend. He didn't even understand what had just happened, yet his nine companions had already lost their lives.\n\n\"Yes, I am a demon. To those I despise, I am a demon. They are dead. You are their captain; in hell, they will still need you to lead the way. Farewell.\" As he spoke, he followed the main road into the distance. At that moment, perhaps because it was noon, there was not a single pedestrian on the road amidst the chilling atmosphere.\n\nA red fireball and a blue ice spike descended from the sky. With the same resounding boom, the last life was extinguished. Nian Bing did not linger in the slightest; a blizzard lifted his body, rising into the air, and carried him far away. Nian Bing discovered that killing was becoming easier for him, as if the identity of the Magic Killer was gradually invading his disposition.\n\nIf viewed as a magical experiment, this was undoubtedly a huge success for him. He would absolutely not hold back against threats that could jeopardize his freedom. However, he was utterly unaware that it was precisely due to his actions that the Ice Moon Empire learned of the war on the front lines several days late, causing the Olan Empire severe losses, and consequently, a deep rift appeared in the two nations' originally friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nFlying in mid-air, Nian Bing tried hard not to recall the scene of his previous killing. The first time he killed Liao San, Liao San was completely consumed by magic, and he hadn't experienced it too clearly. But the scene of flesh and blood splattering just now was so profound. He was also a normal person; a dull ache in his chest forced him to suppress the feeling of nausea, redirecting his thoughts to the application of magic.\n\nThe reason this true Ice-Fire Homology magic could unleash such excellent effects was certainly due to the unique nature of Ice-Fire Homology, but it was also inseparable from his two peerless divine blades. Without the God of Flame's Roar and the Goddess of Ice and Snow's Sigh, such immense power could not have been unleashed. As his comprehension of fire-elemental magic and ice-elemental magic deepened, the true power of these two gems gradually became apparent. Their greatest characteristic was that under the same amount of magical power, they could manifest entirely different levels of power. This became more evident in higher-tier spells. Furthermore, these two gems seemed capable of absorbing magic elements from the air itself, containing inexhaustible energy. This sensation became even stronger, especially after they became one with the current blade bodies.",

    "content": "Without using these two strongest magic staffs, even if he himself used a first-tier magic to cast Ice-Fire Homology, it could at most only achieve the ability of the initial third tier. However, after using these two magic staffs, the resulting explosion was already close to the fourth tier. Of course, being able to so easily kill a Swordsman and nine High-level Warriors also had a fundamental reason: the opponent's underestimation of him. After all, Ice-Fire Homology was not something everyone could comprehend.\n\nAs he pondered the mysteries of magic, the nausea in Nianbing's heart gradually disappeared. He had told himself ever since he killed Liao San that as long as someone obstructed his progress, destroying them was the simplest solution. Therefore, he hadn't held back just now, and even after unleashing the magic, he didn't hesitate in the slightest. The hatred in his heart seemed to be released through the slaughter.\n\nAs he flew forward, Nianbing's heart suddenly tightened. He instinctively looked up ahead, only to see three magicians floating on his inevitable path. Each held a magic staff, and they were staring at him with unfriendly expressions. They were wearing different colored magic robes: green, red, and blue. The emblems on their chests indicated that the magician in the green robe was a Grand Magician, just like himself, while the other two were merely High-level Magicians. His heart slightly settled. Nianbing was deeply confident that with his Ice-Fire Homology magic, dealing with these three magicians wouldn't be a big problem. So, he simply went to meet them.\n\nWhen Nianbing was still about thirty meters away from the three magicians, he couldn't help but gasp. Because he saw a military camp—an endless military camp! That was at least a camp for a hundred thousand strong army! Since the three magicians were previously on a low hill, he hadn't noticed it. Now that he saw it, he immediately recalled the chilling aura of slaughter he had felt earlier. Could they be the Ice Moon Empire's army? No. Impossible, this was already Olan Empire territory. Looking at the camp, it seemed to be orderly deploying. That knight had mentioned earlier that the Huarong Empire had allied with the Qilu Empire to attack the Olan Empire. It seemed the troops stationed here were going to provide support. Their original purpose should have been to defend against the Ice Moon Empire.\n\n\"Stop.\" The leading Wind Magician raised his magic staff at Nianbing. Nianbing controlled the blizzard to halt his body, and feigned surprise, saying, \"What do you three mean by this?\"\n\nLooking at the concentrated, unscattered blizzard beneath Nianbing's feet, the Wind Magician said in a deep voice, \"Are you an Ice Magician?\"\n\nNianbing nodded, \"Indeed, I am from the Ice Moon Empire's Magicians' Guild and am preparing to travel to your esteemed country. May I ask if you three have any business with me?\"\n\nThe Wind Magician frowned slightly and said, \"Our country's army is currently on the move. To avoid unnecessary trouble, please come with us. What's good about the Ice Moon Empire's Magicians' Guild? Hasn't it already declined long ago? From your appearance, you should be a High-level Magician. Such a young High-level Magician, there's no future for you if you stay in the Ice Moon Empire.\"\n\nNianbing's mind raced. What should he do now? Go with them, or refuse them, or directly attack them like before? Relying on the power of Ice-Fire Homology, he was confident he could blast their bodies with Ice-Fire Homology before they could finish chanting their spells. However, they probably had defensive magic scrolls. Once the fight dragged on, it would be extremely disadvantageous for him. After all, there was a hundred thousand strong army in front of him! Even if each person spat a mouthful of saliva, he could be drowned. His master had once said that in any country, as long as the army numbered over ten thousand, there would surely be strong individuals present. Thinking this, the smile on his face appeared even friendlier. \"Three magicians, may I ask, what would I be doing by returning to the military camp with you?\"\n\nThe Wind Magician said, \"Rest assured, we won't make things difficult for you. Once the army sets off, we'll naturally let you leave. Of course, you must show your country's Magicians' Guild emblem.\"\n\nNianbing thought to himself, with his blizzard casting proficiency, if he accelerated and fled now, the other party shouldn't be able to do anything to him. Just as he had this thought, dozens of magicians in various robes rose from the Olan Empire's main army. Most of them were Wind Magicians. Clearly, all of them had been cast with fourth-tier Wind Soaring Art by Wind Magicians, allowing them to maintain flight for a period. Run? Forget it. With so many magicians, wouldn't he be courting death? Thinking this, Nianbing nodded amicably to the Wind Magician in front of him and said, \"Alright, I will cooperate fully.\"\n\nThe three magicians led Nianbing to land on the previous hill. Nianbing presented his magic emblem. However, this time he showed a High-level Magician's emblem. A few days before leaving Ice Snow City, Long Zhi had told him that within the Ice Moon Empire itself, he should display the Elder's emblem, which would garner him more respect and make things more convenient. But once he left the Ice Moon Empire, he should show a different High-level Magician's emblem. After all, Nianbing was still too young; the identity of a High-level Magician would make him less noticeable to others. Long Zhi had told him that although the major empires maintained peace on the surface, in reality, there wasn't a single empire that didn't wish to annex the others. Even the Olan Empire, which was on good terms with Ice Moon, harbored this thought. Therefore, he absolutely must not get involved in such political struggles. He should avoid them as much as possible; war would break out sooner or later.\n\nNow, war had indeed broken out. Among the five great empires on the continent, the strongest in terms of power were Huarong and Olan. The Ice Moon Empire, however, held an extraordinary position due to the presence of the continent's only God Descender, the Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess. Any country wishing to attack them had to consider the terrifying God Descent Art. The Huarong Empire was the only one among the other four empires that paid heed to the Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess. This was because they possessed a formidable army of Fire Magicians. With as many as three Fire Master Archmages, plus a large number of Archmages and Grand Magicians, their overall strength was in no way inferior to the Ice God Tower. Nianbing was most familiar with the Huarong Empire's military strength. He had heard his father say since childhood that the Huarong Empire's Flame Lion Knight Order was the continent's foremost knight order, and the only one equipped with magical cavalry. He wondered if they had participated in this war. Coupled with the Qilu Empire, whose strength was not to be underestimated, it was definitely not something Olan alone could withstand.\n\nWhat was war? Nianbing didn't quite understand. However, he knew that his originally planned route had to change. Places with war held no benefit for him.\n\nAfter the Wind Magician verified Nianbing's guild emblem, he nodded at him and smiled, \"Indeed, a fellow from the Ice Moon Empire. But looking at your emblem, you shouldn't be from the Ice God Tower, should you?\"\n\nNianbing sighed lightly and said, \"My name is Nianbing, and I am from the Ice Moon Empire's Magicians' Guild. Perhaps you already know, our guild's situation has always been not very good. This time, I was entrusted to deliver a letter to your esteemed country. What's happening? Why is your country's military being mobilized on such a large scale?\" He was clearly asking the obvious, but this also highlighted his cleverness.\n\nThe Wind Magician smiled and said, \"Our Guild Master had met your Guild Master Long once. We deeply sympathize with your guild's current plight. With a place like the Ice God Tower existing, no Magicians' Guild in any country would have an easy time. It is rumored that your guild's situation is quite dire now! It seems even the royal special appropriation has been confiscated, hasn't it?\"\n\nNianbing nodded, \"The situation is indeed not very good. Due to various reasons, the guild is gradually declining, and there's nothing that can be done about it. Without national support, an organization like our Magicians' Guild, which consumes so many resources, simply has no chance to develop. Our Guild Master has also been constantly worrying about this matter.\"\n\nThe Wind Magician was not tall, appearing to be in his forties or fifties. A faint green light shimmered around him. His appearance was very ordinary, but his eyes were exceptionally sharp. His most distinctive feature was a large red mole between his eyebrows. He looked at Nianbing and said, \"My name is Sang Jie. As the saying goes, 'a tree dies if moved, but a person thrives,'* have you never considered changing your current situation? The Ice Moon Empire's royal family relies too heavily on the Ice God Tower and simply won't value you—not now, and not in the future. If Guild Master Long is willing, I believe our Olan Empire Magicians' Guild would be very happy to accept you. Perhaps you also know that our Olan Empire is primarily composed of Wind Magicians, and your Guild Master is a Wind Master Archmage. Our Guild Master has said more than once that it would be a great honor to work with Guild Master Long.\"\n\nNianbing smiled. Although the Ice Moon Empire Magicians' Guild was gradually declining, it still possessed over a hundred magicians after all, and had a top-tier magic expert like Long Zhi, so it was quite normal for other guilds to try to win them over. \"Grand Magician Sang Jie, this would probably be very difficult, as you know, your country has always been on good terms with our empire. If our guild were to collectively relocate, it would likely affect the relations between our two countries.\"\n\nSang Jie smiled faintly and said, \"You don't need to worry about that. I hope you can mention this matter to Guild Master Long when you return. As long as he is willing, we naturally have our ways.\"\n\nSeeing the other party's hidden smile, Nianbing felt increasingly that the relations between the various countries were very subtle. However, this proposal of his would probably be difficult to succeed. If Long Zhi had wanted to leave the Ice Moon Empire, he wouldn't have waited until today. He was incredibly reluctant to abandon the Magicians' Guild he himself founded! \"Alright, I will definitely relay this to the Guild Master when I return. Thank you for your kind offer.\"\n\nSang Jie turned his gaze to the Olan army, which was rapidly and orderly setting off. \"The continent is about to be unsettled again. The Huarong Empire and the Qilu Empire have jointly launched an attack on our country. I don't know what they're thinking. Aren't Huarong afraid that the Langmu Empire, which has always been at odds with them, will seize the opportunity to launch a sneak attack?\"\n\n\"Going to war?\" Nianbing asked in surprise, \"Are you going to the battlefield?\"\n\nSang Jie nodded and said, \"We have already sent the knights from your Ice Moon Empire, who were stationed at the border, back to report the news. Now, the entire Olan nation is concentrating its forces and advancing towards the battlefield. Fortunately, the Huarong Empire did not dispatch their elite Flame Lion Knight Order. However, I heard that over ten cities on our country's border have already fallen. The exact situation will only be known once we reach the front lines.\"\n\nNianbing asked curiously, \"How many troops are participating in this war?\"\n\nSang Jie said, \"Quite a number. The allied forces of Huarong and Qilu number a total of four hundred thousand, advancing into our country's territory in three routes. If the enemy weren't too powerful, we wouldn't have needed to dispatch even the troops stationed here back. The Huarong Empire has always only been on good terms with the Qilu Empire, and is a sworn enemy of both the Ice Moon Empire and the Langmu Empire. I truly don't understand why they didn't choose the Langmu Empire but chose our country instead.\"\n\nNianbing lowered his head and said, \"I don't understand anything about war, but I believe the aggressors will surely not succeed.\"\n\nSang Jie turned his head to glance at Nianbing. He found that this handsome young man seemed quite shy, and couldn't help but feel a certain fondness for him. He smiled and said, \"Don't worry, nothing bad will happen. Your Ice Moon Empire will absolutely not stand by and watch the Huarong and Qilu Empires destroy our country. Otherwise, we would become a springboard for those two countries, and the next one to suffer would certainly be your empire. The Langmu Empire is skilled in defense but not in offense; they cannot truly threaten Huarong and Qilu. Meanwhile, your empire's Ice God Tower has always held deep enmity with the Huarong Empire's Flame Sect. The Flame Sect's status in the Huarong Empire is equivalent to that of the royal family. Without our Olan Empire and the Langmu Empire standing in the middle, Huarong and Ice Moon would probably have already fought to the death.\"\n\nUpon hearing the words 'Flame Sect', Nianbing's facial muscles involuntarily twitched. He said nothing more, and together with the three Olan Empire magicians, waited for the military to depart.\n\nThe hundred thousand strong army majestically departed along the main road, forming a winding path on the road. The cavalry was at the very back. After the heavy cavalry legion and light cavalry legion both set off, the previously bustling camp became empty.\n\nSang Jie took out a green, whirlwind-shaped emblem from his pocket and handed it to Nianbing. \"After the war ends, even if your Guild Master Long isn't willing to join our guild, you can take this to the main guild hall and find me. I will arrange things for you. Alright, we must also depart now. Oh, right, if you're going to the capital, your next stop should be Wulan City, which isn't far. I suggest you don't go there. If the letter you're delivering isn't urgent, it's best not to go to the capital for a while. With the war being tense now, security around the capital is extremely strict. As a foreign magician, you probably won't be welcomed there. Therefore, I suggest Nianbing first go to Lanmeng City, not far from Wulan City, and wait for a period. It's best to make your plans after the war ends. Since Lanmeng City is in the rear, it can be said to be a paradise in our Olan Empire. It has the empire's highest-ranking warrior academy and magic academy; you can go check them out if you have time. Alright, we'll meet again. Oh, great Wind! Lend me your freedom, drive the free winds between heaven and earth, let us grow flying wings, and depart from noise, depart from all worries!\"\n\nAs the incantation was chanted, his unassuming magic staff emitted a powerful green light. It not only enveloped himself but also the other two Wind Magicians.\n\nCarried by the green light, their speed suddenly increased. Descending from the hill, they truly seemed to have grown wind wings, gliding towards the distant main army.\n\nSeeing this situation, Nianbing inwardly felt a sense of awe and caution. Sang Jie's magic level was even higher than he had imagined. Although this Wind Wing Art was a sixth-tier auxiliary magic, when cast simultaneously on three people, the required magical power was not as simple as a sixth-tier spell. Judging by his appearance, he should soon be able to enter the realm of Archmage. His advice was well-intentioned; although he had the intention of winning him over, as he said, now was indeed not a good time to go to the Olan Empire's capital.\n\n---\n* The idiom \"樹挪死，人挪活\" (shù nuó sǐ, rén nuó huó) literally means \"a tree dies if moved, but a person thrives.\" It implies that people, unlike trees, should be adaptable and seek better opportunities or environments if their current situation is unfavorable, rather than remaining stagnant.",

    "content": "Taking out a map from his Space Ring, Nianbing carefully identified his position. He realized that, as Sangjie had said, Lanmeng City was almost parallel to Wulan City. From here, going directly to Olan City, the capital of the Olan Empire, would definitely require passing through Wulan City, making it the shortest distance. However, going via Lanmeng City would be a detour. Yet, to avoid being affected by the war, going to Lanmeng City now was clearly the best choice. Anyway, Luorou's wedding wouldn't be for another two years, so there was plenty of time. He might as well stay in Lanmeng City for a while, using this time to properly cultivate his magic and also deepen his culinary practice. Through his sparring with Minghui, Nianbing had gained some understanding of the Water-Breaking and Surface-Protecting Profound Jade Hand. Although he couldn't perform the special training methods of the Profound Jade Hand, with his manipulation of fire elements, heat wouldn't affect him much. With more practice, he might still achieve the water-breaking effect. Lanmeng City, he would go to Lanmeng City.\n\nThinking of this, Nianbing put away the map. He chanted the Blizzard Spell and headed down the slope. The road from Binglan City to Lanmeng City was sparsely populated. This time, with the map, Nianbing didn't take the main road, opting instead for hidden paths. He tried using the Blizzard Spell to fly for extended periods. However, Blizzard was not a wind-element magic after all. Even at his full power, he could only fly for a little over two hours. Nevertheless, a little over two hours of flying was equivalent to two days of walking. Nianbing realized this was an excellent training method; it greatly benefited the improvement of his magic power. So he simply gave up walking and purely relied on Blizzard to travel. Whenever his magic power was insufficient, he would find a secluded spot, use magic scrolls for defense, and once his magic power recovered, he would continue his journey.\n\nRelying on the speed of Blizzard, three days later, he finally reached his temporary destination—Lanmeng City.\n\nFrom a distance, Lanmeng City was already in sight. Perhaps because it was the backyard of the Olan Empire, there weren't many defenses. The city walls were not tall, only a little over ten meters, completely incomparable to the level of defense of Binglan City. The city gates were wide open, and there weren't many passersby. Only four Olan Empire soldiers were guarding the city gate.\n\nOlan Empire citizens were not much different from Bingyue Empire citizens, except for being relatively shorter in stature. Their hair was mainly blue, purple, and black. Blue-haired Olans were almost indistinguishable from those in the Bingyue Empire. Golden hair like his own was extremely rare. Nianbing strode towards Lanmeng City. Since he had decided to wait here until the war ended, he would need to find a good and inexpensive inn.\n\nWhile thinking, Nianbing had already arrived at the gate of Lanmeng City. The guards didn't trouble him because of his golden hair. Without even glancing at him, they let him pass. Upon entering Lanmeng City, he immediately felt a special sensation. The entire city seemed enveloped by an atmosphere of peace. It was approaching noon, and there weren't many people on the streets, but from their faces, one could see smiles of ease and contentment.\n\n\"Young man, are you here to register?\" Nianbing was looking for inns on both sides of the street when a strange voice suddenly appeared behind him. Turning around, he saw a middle-aged man in his thirties looking at him. Small in stature, his smile looked a bit lewd. Before Nianbing could speak, he stepped forward and proactively said: \"From your appearance, you must be a foreigner. You must be here in Lanmeng City to study. What do you want to learn? Martial arts? That's too common. If you join the army, war is merciless. It's better to learn a skill to fall back on; that will benefit you for life!\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly: \"Does one have to be here to study when coming to Lanmeng City?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man was startled for a moment, then said: \"Aren't you here to study? For a foreigner your age coming to Lanmeng City, I really can't think of any other reason besides studying. Lanmeng City is known as the Academy City, and it's not for nothing. Academies for various industries are established throughout our city. Especially the continent's only comprehensive academy, which is the largest educational institution on the entire continent. Although the tuition is a bit high, you will definitely learn the knowledge you need there. Young people, you should learn more. Otherwise, it will be difficult to learn once you enter society.\"\n\nThe four words \"Academy City\" piqued Nianbing's interest. \"So, what can one learn at your comprehensive academy here?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man rubbed his hands together. His small eyes revealed a look that showed his target had taken the bait. Although it was only a fleeting glance, Nianbing still caught it. \"Young man, the most famous place in our Lanmeng City is Lanmeng Academy. That's the comprehensive academy I just told you about. There, you'll find dozens of the most popular industry departments. Each has strong teaching staff. Tuition fees vary depending on the industry. Furthermore, it's not just about having money; you also need to pass certain examinations. If you can get a diploma from Lanmeng Academy, you'll be able to find a suitable job anywhere on the continent. Of course, the entrance exam for the academy is a bit difficult. But if you don't pass the exam, it doesn't matter. We also have many smaller academies in Lanmeng City, covering a wide range of industries, certainly no worse than Lanmeng Academy. And the tuition fees are much lower. Sometimes, teachers from Lanmeng Academy even teach classes at these academies. So, what industry are you interested in?\"\n\nHearing this, Nianbing couldn't help but recall Xuejing asking him which culinary school he had graduated from when he first arrived in Bingxue City. Subconsciously, he asked: \"Does Lanmeng Academy have a culinary department?\"\n\n\"Culinary arts?\" The middle-aged man was momentarily stunned upon hearing these two words. He couldn't fathom how this tall, spirited, handsome young man in front of him could be interested in the culinary profession, which was traditionally at the bottom of the continent's social ladder. However, his reaction was swift. After a brief moment of surprise, he quickly chuckled: \"Of course, of course it does. Being a chef is a very common profession, after all. You want to learn culinary arts? No problem. In our Academy City, there's nothing you can't imagine that we don't teach. So, young man, do you need my help with an introduction? I have connections in both Lanmeng Academy and the ordinary smaller academies.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly and said: \"Then please trouble yourself to introduce me to Lanmeng Academy.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man chuckled: \"That's simple, that's simple. As a common profession, the culinary department's fees are relatively modest. But that's your business. As long as you can pass the exam, if your performance is excellent, you might even receive a tuition waiver. However, this introduction fee...\" Saying this, he rubbed his fingers together.\n\nNianbing had already understood what this person did from the moment he started talking about the academy. However, he had just arrived and was unfamiliar with everything. Listening to his explanation was beneficial to him. Now seeing the other party reveal his true colors, he couldn't help but smile faintly and said: \"The introduction fee is easy to discuss, as long as you can let me participate in the test exam, that's enough. It's just, does Lanmeng Academy recruit students at any time? Doesn't it have any special regulations?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man said: \"Of course not. Lanmeng Academy is very special; for any department, tests can be conducted at any time. As long as you pass the test, the department's instructor will arrange for you to enter the corresponding grade for study. The culinary department seems to be divided into five grades. However, there's one thing I must remind you: to be admitted to Lanmeng Academy, you must have a certain foundation in that industry, otherwise it will be very difficult to pass the exam. As for this introduction fee, I'll just charge you one gold coin. The price is cheap, and with my introduction, you can participate in the exam today. How about it?\"\n\n\"One gold coin? You might as well just rob me.\" Nianbing said irritably. He had only spent one gold coin to buy kitchen utensils from Quanquan Tianquan Xuan. This middle-aged man was really asking for an exorbitant price.\n\nThe middle-aged man chuckled: \"My fee is very reasonable, absolutely worth its value. If you don't have my introduction, you'll have to wait until ten people are gathered before you can take the test. For every day you delay, won't you miss learning a lot of things? Alright, how about this, seeing as we met at the city gate today, I'll give you a twenty percent discount. Isn't that cheap enough?\"\n\nNianbing smiled. \"Cheap? Eight silver coins might be nothing to some rich young masters, but look at me – after telling you to go rob someone, do I look like a rich young master? Moreover, rich young masters probably don't go to learn culinary arts, do they? One silver coin, that's the price I can afford. Any more than that, and it's a no-go. I'd rather wait until ten people are gathered.\"\n\n\"One silver coin? Kid, you're too stingy.\" Upon hearing Nianbing could only offer so little money, the middle-aged man's attitude immediately changed. His previous \"young man\" instantly downgraded to \"kid.\"\n\nNianbing said calmly: \"You just need to say a few good words for me. Earning one silver coin for speaking my name is already quite a lot. If you're unwilling, then forget it. I'll find it myself.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man's eyes flickered, revealing a hint of disdain. \"Fine, one silver coin it is. But I'm telling you beforehand, I'm only responsible for taking you there. If you can't pass the assessment, or if you don't have money for tuition, it's none of my business, and your money will absolutely not be refunded. Let's go, follow me.\" Saying this, he walked along the street deeper into the city.\n\nDid Nianbing really care about money that much? Of course not. He just wanted his money to be spent on something worthwhile. A culinary school, not bad. If he studied here, not only would he not need to find a place to stay, he might also be able to interact with some culinary masters. Using the evenings for magic cultivation was indeed the best choice right now. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel fortunate to have come to this city. Now, he only hoped that Lanmeng Academy was indeed as the middle-aged man described, worthy of the title \"Continent's Foremost Academy.\"\n\nPerhaps because Nianbing offered too little money, the middle-aged man couldn't be bothered to waste more words on him. He led him through twists and turns deeper into Lanmeng City. As they walked, Nianbing observed his surroundings. He soon realized that although the middle-aged man was somewhat greedy, he hadn't lied. Along the way, he had seen no fewer than ten places with academy signboards. Although they didn't look large, they indeed covered various industries, including forging, magic, martial arts, politics, tailoring, business, and so on. Even some relatively obscure minor industries were involved. The areas around these academies were also relatively prosperous parts of Lanmeng City. Young people dressed in identical attire could often be seen walking on the streets; the insignia on their clothes clearly indicated the academy's name.\n\nWalking from the north of the city all the way to the west, the middle-aged man finally stopped. \"Here we are, this is it.\" Nianbing looked in the direction he was pointing. He didn't see any academy signboard. It was a very ordinary medium-sized restaurant, with the four characters \"Rujia Restaurant\" hanging above its entrance. There wasn't a single person at the entrance.\n\n\"Here? You haven't made a mistake, have you? Is this an academy?\" Nianbing said, somewhat displeased.\n\nThe middle-aged man snorted, saying irritably: \"Idiot, who said I'd take you directly to the academy? Without passing an assessment, going to the academy is useless. This restaurant is the assessment point for Lanmeng Academy's culinary department. Go on in. First, give me the introduction fee, and I'll take you inside to participate in the assessment.\"\n\nNianbing took out a silver coin and tossed it to the middle-aged man. He wasn't afraid of this lewd fellow reneging; his body wasn't tougher than those high-ranking warriors of the Iron Blood Knight Order, was it?\n\nThe middle-aged man tossed the silver coin in his hand a few times. He put it into his pocket, somewhat displeased. \"Follow me.\" He dropped the words indifferently and led the way towards Rujia Restaurant.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, it was a bit livelier than Nianbing had imagined. The restaurant hall was several hundred square meters, and five or six tables were half-full¹. Service staff moved ceaselessly. Business seemed decent.\n\nThe middle-aged man led Nianbing to the counter. Behind the counter stood a young girl. She was not tall, only reaching Nianbing's chest. Her all-in-one blue top and pants had no excessive decorations, looking very plain. Her long blue hair was combed into a large braid that hung down her back. She was bowing her head, fiddling with an abacus, seemingly doing accounts.\n\n\"Miss Meng, hello, I've brought you a new student.\" The middle-aged man ingratiatingly smiled at the girl behind the counter.\n\nThe girl raised her head. When Nianbing saw her appearance, a feeling of astonishment immediately arose in his heart. This blue-clad girl had a pair of large purple eyes. Her gaze was very calm, and somewhat cold. Although not tall and not as full-figured as Xuejing, she naturally possessed an ethereal aura. Seeing the middle-aged man, the coldness in her purple eyes intensified slightly. \"What are you doing here? Haven't you been over at the Martial Arts Academy recruiting people for them recently? How do you have time to come over to our side today?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man pointed to Nianbing beside him and said: \"Miss Meng, it's like this: today I met this kid outside the city gate, he wants to enter the academy to study culinary arts, so I brought him here.\"\n___\n¹ Translator's note: The original text \"五、六十張桌子坐了五城滿\" literally translates to \"five or six tens of tables were seated five cities full,\" which is likely a typo and intended to be \"五、六十張桌子坐了五成滿\" (five or six tens of tables were fifty percent full, i.e., half-full). This translation assumes the latter for readability.",

    "content": "Meng-gūniáng looked up at Nian Bing. From her radiating cold eyes, Nian Bing saw no emotional fluctuation. \"Him? You should have taken him to the Beauty Department. There are plenty of beauties there; perhaps he'd charm a few and enter the academy directly without an assessment. We don't accept good-for-nothings here. Take him away.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man chuckled, saying, \"I don't think he's cut out to be a chef either. Anyway, I've already brought the person here. Since you won't accept him, it has nothing to do with me. Kid, you can't blame me for this. If you've got what it takes, persuade Meng-gūniáng yourself. She is in overall charge of this morning's assessment.\" Having said that, the middle-aged man turned and left, giving Nian Bing no chance to react.\n\nNian Bing didn't bother with the middle-aged man. Being brought here was enough for him. This cold and striking Meng-gūniáng made Nian Bing somewhat curious. From her, Nian Bing could tell that the Lan Meng Academy still had some depth to it. He wasn't focused on Meng-gūniáng's appearance but on her hands. She had a pair of slender hands, her nails neatly trimmed, without any ornaments. When manipulating an abacus, her fingers were extremely nimble—these were definitely the hands of a highly skilled chef.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing still standing there, Meng-gūniáng couldn't help but frown and say, \"Didn't you hear me? You can leave now. Don't stand here being an eyesore. Why bother being so tall for no reason?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, saying, \"Being tall doesn't seem to be my fault, does it? That person just said that as long as he brought me here, I could undergo the assessment. I haven't been tested yet, so how can I leave?\"\n\nMeng-gūniáng snorted. \"Let me teach you a thing or two. That fellow just now, Li San'er, is a well-known local ruffian in the city. On one accidental occasion, he saved our academy's dean, and the dean unintentionally promised him that any student he brought could undergo assessment directly in any department, without waiting for ten people to gather. But who knew he would seize this opportunity to make a living from this, charging exorbitant referral fees? You must have spent a good deal of money, right? However, your money was wasted. Don't easily trust others in the future. Consider this a lesson.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"One silver coin for a lesson, that doesn't seem cheap! Since Li San'er has the dean's special permission, then I should be able to participate in the assessment, right!\"\n\nMeng-gūniáng said indifferently, \"Your assessment is already over. So, you can leave. We don't accept incompetent individuals here. Even if you studied for five years, you wouldn't achieve anything. A chef might be a lowly profession, but not everyone can do this profession well.\"\n\nNian Bing felt a burst of amusement in his heart. Even if his culinary skills hadn't reached the pinnacle, he certainly couldn't be called incompetent, could he? He asked curiously, \"Meng-gūniáng, won't you tell me how you assessed me and determined that I'm not cut out to be a chef?\"\n\nMeng-gūniáng was clearly getting impatient, and said coldly, \"It's simple: your hands. Although you're plainly dressed, a person's temperament won't easily change. Add to that your hands that clearly haven't done any labor, and a grown man wearing a ring—do you think you're very handsome? In my eyes, you're just a culinary idiot. I think you have the potential for professions that rely on appearance. Leave here; we don't welcome students like you.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at his hands. He knew that Meng-gūniáng had already taken him for a fop. Explaining anything now would be useless; only facts could prove everything. \"Meng-gūniáng, no matter what, I spent one silver coin to buy this assessment. If you make me leave like this, I definitely won't give up. How about this? Give me a chance to try making a dish?\"\n\nMeng-gūniáng looked at Nian Bing with some surprise. Nian Bing's persistence was unexpected. She said indifferently, \"There's no need to go to the trouble of making a dish. Do you see those cold dishes over there? As long as you can sell all of them within half an hour*, it will prove you have a talent for being a chef. You can modify these cold dishes however you like, provided they don't kill anyone.\"\n\nNian Bing looked in the direction Meng-gūniáng pointed. Not far from the counter, there was another counter, covered with transparent gauze, containing more than ten serving trays of cold dishes. These weren't ordinary small plates, but large serving trays. It looked like each serving tray of cold dishes could fill more than ten ordinary plates. Calculating this, at least each table of guests would have to buy more than three plates of cold dishes to sell all of them. Selling all of these in half an hour was clearly meant to make things difficult for him. Nian Bing smiled slightly, said nothing more, walked to the water source beside the counter to wash his hands, and went directly to the back of the cold dish counter.\n\nBehind the counter, there was already a young chef. He had naturally heard Meng-gūniáng's words. Seeing Nian Bing walk over, he made a welcoming gesture to him and stood aside with an expression of watching a good show.\n\nAfter a quick look at the cold dishes in front of him, Nian Bing picked up his chopsticks and tasted each one. With confidence, he began his sales process. First, he chose a plate of cold cucumber salad, directly pulled the large serving tray out from behind a gauze curtain on the counter, placed it on the counter, and asked the chef who was watching nearby, \"Do you have a kitchen knife?\"\n\nThe chef was stunned for a moment and said, \"This is for selling cold dishes, not cooked food. What do you need a kitchen knife for?\" He didn't believe this handsome young man, who seemed even younger than himself, could do anything.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Without a kitchen knife, how am I supposed to sell? Please provide me with a kitchen knife. If I can't sell it within half an hour, I'll naturally leave.\"\n\n\"Give him the kitchen knife,\" Meng-gūniáng's voice came. The young chef acknowledged and ran to the kitchen in the back. In a moment, he returned with a kitchen knife.\n\nTaking the kitchen knife, Nian Bing weighed it in his hand. He used the serving spoon for cold dishes to spread the cucumbers flat on the tray. He pressed his thumb against the spine of the blade, his index finger against the hilt, and his middle, ring, and pinky fingers gripping the handle tightly, making the entire blade stand upright. The broad, thick blade was truly not suitable for him to perform his skill, but he didn't want to expose that he knew magic right now, so he could only manage this with some difficulty. He turned his head and glanced at Meng-gūniáng. She was watching him, but now the disdainful gaze in her eyes was gone, replaced by solemnity. It seemed she had noticed his knife grip.\n\n\"Emerald Dream Cucumbers! Anyone want some?\" Nian Bing raised his voice and shouted. The quiet in the restaurant was instantly broken. All the guests turned their gaze in his direction, most with expressions of disgust. But soon, their expressions turned to astonishment, because the knife in Nian Bing's hand moved. The broad, thick kitchen knife, ill-suited for his hand, seemed to dance in Nian Bing's grip. The tip of the knife spun continuously like a top. His wrist seemed boneless, effortlessly shifting into any desired posture. And the cold cucumber salad in the large serving tray didn't splash a single drop under the knife's intricate work; instead, the originally diamond-shaped cucumbers were changing shape. What were Emerald Dream Cucumbers? Very simple: all the cucumbers transformed into the character 'Meng' (梦)**, and the cucumber scraps were skillfully picked aside, separated from the cucumbers themselves, without the slightest impact. Nian Bing's hand was very steady. Almost every tremor would make a dozen or so pieces of cucumber transform into the character 'Meng', but the kitchen knife in his hand was really not handy, meaning the 'Meng' characters weren't entirely identical, with slight differences in some places. But for now, this was enough.\n\nThe guests at the table closest to the cold dish counter saw it most clearly. The flashing knife movements in Nian Bing's hand alone were enough to attract them. One of the middle-aged men of average build stood up and walked to the cold dish counter. As soon as he saw the changes in the cucumbers on the tray, he immediately opened his mouth wide in astonishment. This was no longer entirely within the realm of culinary art. Such exquisite knife work was simply incomprehensible to an ordinary person like him.\n\nThe knife in Nian Bing's hand stopped. He smiled slightly and said, \"Want a plate? One silver coin per plate.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man was stunned for a moment. \"One silver coin? Are you kidding me? This originally cost only three copper coins a plate. It suddenly became three times the price!\"\n\nNian Bing said proudly, \"Do you think this 'Meng' character isn't worth a silver coin?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man gave Nian Bing a thumbs up and said, \"It is, young man. Your knife skill is truly divine! Give me a plate. One silver coin it is.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, served out a plate of Emerald Dream Cucumbers, and handed it over. He pointed to the counter and said, \"Please give the money to Meng-gūniáng. Who else needs these Emerald Dream Cucumbers?\"\n\nNearby, several guests stood up. Even if they weren't buying, curiosity prompted them to come and see what exactly was happening. When they saw the Meng-character shaped cucumbers, they were all stunned. Such magical knife work made them, one by one, untie their purses and buy a plate. Just as Nian Bing was about to continue selling his handmade Emerald Dream Cucumbers, Meng-gūniáng's figure appeared before him.\n\n\"Alright, stop selling. Is the Jin-zi Xu You*** only worth one silver coin?\" Meng-gūniáng's gaze at Nian Bing was somewhat complex, stopping him from continuing to cut cucumbers.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, put down the kitchen knife, and said, \"Am I still considered a culinary idiot now? I wonder if I've passed the test?\"\n\nMeng-gūniáng nodded and said, \"Come with me. Everyone, apologies for disturbing your meal. This is our new student in the Culinary Arts Department.\" Having said that, she led Nian Bing towards the back.\n\nPassing through the bustling kitchen, Meng-gūniáng led Nian Bing directly to the backyard. \"Who did you learn your Jin-zi Xu You from?\" Meng-gūniáng's tone was a bit urgent.\n\nNian Bing said, \"An old man taught me. I don't know his name. After teaching me knife skills for a few days, he left.\"\n\nMeng-gūniáng's already large eyes widened even further. \"What did you say? Just a few days? Do you take me for a fool? For an ordinary person to practice Jin-zi Xu You, without guidance from a renowned master, even decades wouldn't yield any results. Who exactly did you learn your knife skills from?\"\n\nNian Bing said indifferently, \"Meng-gūniáng, don't you think you're asking too many questions? Who I learned my knife skills from is my secret. I came to the Culinary Arts Academy to attend classes, not to be interrogated by you.\"\n\nHer urgent expression softened somewhat. She nodded and said, \"I apologize. It was my fault for looking down on you earlier. I apologize to you.\" Having said that, she actually bowed slightly to Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing wanted to help her up, but then he remembered the distinction between men and women, and raised his hands, but they hung in mid-air. \"Meng-gūniáng, please don't be so polite. From your nimble hands, you must also be skilled in knife techniques, right? We can exchange pointers more often if there's an opportunity. I came here precisely to deepen my skills.\"\n\nThe coldness in Meng-gūniáng's eyes lessened somewhat. She said, \"Let's go. I'll take you to enroll at the academy. Our Culinary Arts Department also has various courses, and I will recommend you to the Department Head.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"Then I'll trouble Meng-gūniáng. I also hope to learn more knowledge here.\"\n\nMeng-gūniáng nodded, clearly much more polite to Nian Bing. \"Please follow me.\" The two exited the restaurant through the backyard, and under her guidance, walked towards the back.\n\nWhen Nian Bing truly arrived at Lan Meng Academy, his astonishment was hard to conceal. Rather than calling it an academy, it was more like a small city. The academy's surrounding walls were city walls five meters wide and ten meters high, and even the guards at the entrance wore the standard military uniforms of the Olan Empire. Only a huge plaque hanging above the main gate's watchtower revealed this place to be an academy.\n\nMeng-gūniáng couldn't help but let out a chuckle at Nian Bing's almost idiotic gaze. She, who had always been cold, suddenly laughed, and it was instantly like a spring breeze thawing ice, attracting Nian Bing's gaze. She said, \"Lan Meng Academy has a long history and is one of the oldest academies on the Yangguang Continent. This academy occupies one-third of Lan Meng City's area, making it a city within a city. The city walls you see are works created by the students of the academy's Architecture Department, involving various fields such as defense systems, drainage systems, and counter-attack systems. It is said that their defensive capabilities are far stronger than those of an average small city. The guards at the entrance are not real soldiers but students from the Martial Arts Department. The academy's Martial Arts Department is the most famous among all departments. The Department Head of the Martial Arts Department is one of the oldest Martial Saints**** on the continent, ranking fifth among the Top Ten Martial Arts Masters on the Continent. This attraction makes the Martial Arts Department the largest faction within the academy, accounting for about one-fifth of the entire academy. Our Martial Arts Academy has supplied many talents to the Empire. All qualified graduates are sought-after recruits for the Empire's various knight orders, and some even have the chance to join the Empire's ace Silver Feather Knight Order.\"\n\nNian Bing secretly marveled in his heart at the scale of Lan Meng Academy, but the expression on his face had returned to normal. He nodded and said, \"The academy's strength is truly formidable! However, I'm not very interested in other departments. Meng-gūniáng, could you introduce our Culinary Arts Department? Are you a teacher or a student, after all? Judging by your appearance, you should be under twenty, right?\"\n___\n* *Bàn gè shíchen* (半個時辰), a traditional Chinese unit of time usually equivalent to one hour (half of a *shichen*, which is two hours).\n** Meng (梦): The Chinese character for \"dream.\" It is also the first character of Meng-gūniáng's name, implying a pun on her name.\n*** Jin-zi Xu You (錦字虛牖): A specific, highly advanced knife technique. Literally translates to \"Brocade Character Empty Lattice.\"\n**** Martial Saint (武聖): A highly revered master of martial arts, often considered to have reached a pinnacle of skill.",

    "content": "Meng-guniang's smile had long vanished, like an epiphyllum blooming in a fleeting moment*. She said, \"You... (unclear, probably 'mistook' these three characters) me. I am already twenty-two this year. My name is Zi Qingmeng. You can just call me by my name from now on. No more 'Meng-guniang, Meng-guniang' this and that. Our Culinary Arts Department is a small department in the academy. Besides the Magic Department, which has the fewest students, we come next. The entire department has only a little over a thousand students, divided into five grades. Each grade has five classes, teaching hot dish cooking, cold dish preparation, pastry, medicinal cuisine, and local snacks, respectively. Among them, hot dish cooking has the most students, accounting for about one-third of each grade's total. As for me, I am a fifth-year student in the Cold Dish Preparation department, and at the same time, I am also the knife skills instructor for this department. So, you can think whatever you like.\"\n\nKnife skills instructor? It seems I didn't misjudge after all! My greatest strength is also knife skills. If there's a chance, I really must spar with her. As Nianbing thought this, he had already followed Zi Qingmeng to the academy gate. The four students on guard straightened their bodies immediately upon seeing her, their eyes showing deference, and they said in unison, \"Greetings, senior!\"\n\nZi Qingmeng merely nodded and didn't stop, leading Nianbing into the academy. \"Why do they call you 'senior' and not 'teacher'?\" Nianbing asked, voicing the doubt in his heart.\n\nZi Qingmeng glanced at him and said, \"Because I'm a student in the Martial Arts Department, also a fifth-year student, so naturally they call me 'senior.' Oh, I forgot to tell you, in this academy, as long as you have the ability to pass the exams, you can study several majors concurrently. Of course, tuition fees are required, and you must pass the exams for that department.\"\n\nNianbing's heart stirred. Sensing the cool aura about Zi Qingmeng, he said, \"I imagine your main major is Martial Arts, and Culinary Arts is your elective?\" His gaze didn't linger on Zi Qingmeng, but instead, he looked at the massive sports ground before him. At least several thousand people were active on the ground; some were chatting, some sparring in martial arts, some walking. Yet, thousands of people made the sports ground seem desolate. The surface of the vast sports ground, made of an unknown material, was bluish-gray and felt extremely hard. Around the sports ground were buildings towering up to eight stories high. Those should be the teaching buildings. It was Nianbing's first time seeing such tall buildings, and his curiosity about Lanmeng Academy couldn't help but deepen.\n\nZi Qingmeng looked at Nianbing with some surprise and said, \"How did you know?\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly. \"If I said I guessed, would you believe me?\" Of course, he had guessed, but his guess was well-founded. When Zi Qingmeng introduced Lanmeng Academy, she mentioned the Martial Arts Department first, not the Culinary Arts Department. Moreover, when she spoke of the Martial Arts Department's glory, her expression clearly showed a hint of pride, whereas when she spoke of the Culinary Arts Department, her expression was much more subdued. Nianbing was good at observation and had made the correct judgment from the subtle expressions she inadvertently revealed.\n\nZi Qingmeng didn't press the matter. The two silently crossed the sports ground. She led Nianbing directly towards the teaching building on the west side. When they reached the front of the teaching building, Zi Qingmeng didn't lead Nianbing inside. Instead, she took him around the side of the building to the back. \"The teaching buildings outside are mainly for the larger departments. The Culinary Arts Department is in that building. Don't forget it in the future. The dormitories are also in that building.\"\n\nThat was a five-story building. In other places, a five-story building would be considered quite tall, but compared to the eight-story buildings outside, it was nothing. The entire building looked quite spacious. The students coming and going all wore the same dark blue uniforms as those on the sports ground outside, except for the small badges on their chests, which all bore the characters \"Culinary Arts.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng led Nianbing up to the fifth floor and arrived at an office door. She pushed the door open directly. Nianbing followed behind her, and before he could see what was inside, he first heard a shriek.\n\n\"Ah! Who is so ill-mannered, just coming in without knocking? ...Little Meng, so it's you! You scared me to death. Please, could you knock next time?\"\n\nNianbing peeked in from behind Zi Qingmeng and saw a man and a woman tidying their disheveled clothes. The man appeared to be over fifty, slightly hunchbacked, with only a circle of red hair around his bald crown, which was as barren as a hillside. He had small eyes, a bulbous nose, and a wide mouth – almost any derogatory description of appearance wouldn't be excessive for him. What was peculiar was that the woman, who had clearly been intimate with him earlier, looked much younger, only around thirty. She was graceful and had a good figure and looks, currently blushing deeply as she fastened her bra.\n\nZi Qingmeng said coldly, \"Great Casanova, I've brought you a new student.\"\n\nThe hunchbacked man coughed a few times and said, \"For new students, couldn't you just decide? Why bring them all the way here to me? Alright, come in, both of you. Little Yiyi, you can go out first. I'll find you when I have time.\" Hearing him utter \"Little Yiyi\" in a sugary voice, Nianbing almost had the impulse to turn and leave. This was the head of the Culinary Arts Department? The middle-aged woman cast a flirtatious glance at the department head, as if she hadn't noticed the handsome Nianbing, tugged at her top, and calmly departed. Zi Qingmeng, meanwhile, seemed long accustomed to this scene, her expression utterly unchanged.\n\nThe hunchbacked department head cleared his throat and said, \"Come, sit first. It's a bit messy in here.\" It was indeed messy, and not just a bit. Things were scattered everywhere in the large office, and there was even a small puddle of liquid on the desk. Yet, the air in the office was surprisingly fresh. Zi Qingmeng and Nianbing walked into the room. After the department head tidied the desk a little, he fixed his gaze on Nianbing. \"For Little Meng to bring you personally, you must have some skill. Young man, what can you do?\"\n\nNianbing coughed, maintaining a smile on his face. \"I merely studied cooking for a few days before, and I thought I'd come to your esteemed academy to learn some culinary arts.\"\n\nThe department head's gaze turned to Zi Qingmeng. Zi Qingmeng said coldly, \"Don't look at me. Have you ever seen someone who only studied cooking for a few days know 'Brocade Character Empty Window'**? I've handed him over to you; you handle it.\" Having said that, she turned and left, as if unwilling to stay in the room for another moment.\n\nUpon hearing the four characters 'Brocade Character Empty Window,' the department head's originally dim eyes shone brightly. \"'Brocade Character Empty Window.' You know 'Brocade Character Empty Window,' one of the Five Great Knife Techniques?\"\n\nNianbing looked at the department head's prominent-knuckled hands and said, \"Something like that. It's just that my mastery isn't quite there yet.\" This wasn't him being modest. Whether it was 'Brocade Character Empty Window' or 'Dragon Plume Gathering Dance'***, he still had a significant gap to reach their pinnacle. But now, it wasn't a stage where mere practice would be effective. As Cha Ji had said, what he needed now was 'enlightenment.'\n\n\"Did Cha Ji send you to find me?\" The department head sat back down, but his words sent a jolt through Nianbing. With a faint smile, he said, \"Besides old Cha, probably no one else could teach someone around twenty years old to know 'Brocade Character Empty Window.' You don't need to be surprised. I really didn't expect old Cha, after twenty years of silence, to finally have news.\"\n\n\"You know my master?\" Nianbing's voice lost its composure. The lewd-looking old man before him gave him a feeling of unfathomable depth.\n\nThe department head chuckled. \"Didn't your master ever mention Lecherous Hunchback Zi Xiu to you? That old geezer wouldn't have forgotten his old friends, would he?\"\n\nAs the four characters 'Lecherous Hunchback Zi Xiu' entered his ears, Nianbing immediately recalled a passage Cha Ji had once told him, a description of the chefs of his era. In his time, there were five most outstanding chefs, known in the culinary world as the Five Kitchen Gods, bearing the nicknames Ghost, Fiery, Hunchback, Spirit, and Marvelous. Among them, the Marvelous Kitchen God, who was also Mingyuan and Minghui's master, was known as the 'Immortal of Cuisine' and excelled at delicate techniques and pastry making. As for his own master, Cha Ji, he was one of the Five Kitchen Gods. The five of them had gathered three times to determine their rankings. Those three occasions were known as the most magnificent pinnacle duels in the history of the culinary world. Ghost Chef Cha Ji, with his ghost-like craftsmanship, won by a slight margin each time, while the abilities of the other four Kitchen Gods were only marginally different in sequence. When Cha Ji evaluated the Hunchback Kitchen God, his expression was very strange. He had said: \"That lecherous hunchback Zi Xiu, that old reprobate, is the most distinctive among us five. That fellow's culinary skills are not only superb but also bizarre. Perhaps you won't believe it, but his most famous dishes all found their inspiration from women.\" Lecherous Hunchback Zi Xiu, Lecherous Hunchback Zi Xiu. He hadn't expected the Hunchback Kitchen God, ranked third among the Five Kitchen Gods, to be the head of this culinary academy.\n\nNianbing quickly bowed and saluted Zi Xiu, saying, \"Senior Zi Xiu, so you are the renowned Hunchback Kitchen God! This junior has truly been disrespectful.\"\n\nZi Xiu said somewhat impatiently, \"Alright, I hate these mundane formalities. Kid, how long did you study cooking with that old man Cha Ji? Where is he now? For the past twenty years, he hasn't sent a single word. The culinary world outside has already changed drastically.\"\n\nSorrow emanated from Nianbing. Recalling his master's teachings, he couldn't help but take a deep breath. \"Senior Zi Xiu, my master has passed away. He passed away before I left. I followed my master for eight years, and Nianbing hasn't dared to forget his elder's earnest teachings for a single moment. Senior Zi Xiu, since you are an old friend of my master, could you tell me who it was that made that wager with my master, causing his terrible defeat and the severing of his hand tendons?\"\n\nHunchback Chef Zi Xiu's eyes rolled. \"That old man Cha Ji is dead? Good, good that he's dead. With him gone, there's one less person holding me down in front. Die, die, good, why am I not dead yet?\" Although he was cursing, Nianbing clearly noticed that his large, prominent-knuckled hands, which should have been extremely steady, were trembling slightly. For a top chef, this was an almost impossible situation. Tears flickered in Zi Xiu's eyes, but he still didn't shed them. He sat there blankly, like a statue.\n\n\"Senior Zi, are you alright? My master has passed on, but he went peacefully. Please don't be sad.\" Seeing Zi Xiu's appearance, Nianbing understood that although the old man before him had contended with his master his whole life, a deep friendship still existed between them.\n\n\"I'll be fine even if you're not. Damn it, that old bastard Cha Ji died so early. I wonder how much of his skill you've learned. If Ghost Chef's techniques are lost, I won't forgive him even in the underworld. Kid, you want to know who forced your master to sever his hand tendons? Fine, as long as you can defeat me in culinary arts, I'll tell you. Otherwise, you'll never know. I, Lecherous Hunchback Zi Xiu, keep my word; there's absolutely no room for negotiation. I'll arrange for you to attend classes in the fifth year. A year from now, if you still can't achieve culinary skills that can contend with mine, you can get lost.\"\n\nNianbing respectfully said, \"Senior Zi, I don't think we need to wait that long. I challenge you right now. I hope you keep your word and tell me about that challenger from back then if you lose.\"\n\n\"Now? Good lad, just as cocky as your dead master. Are you that capable? Did your master ever tell you what I'm best at?\" The Hunchback Chef's voice was full of arrogance.\n\nNianbing smiled. Although Zi Xiu was continuously cursing Cha Ji, he understood that the Hunchback Chef before him had an extremely deep affection for his master. \"Senior Zi Xiu, please forgive my disrespect,\" Nianbing said. \"At the time, Master evaluated you like this: he said, 'That lecherous hunchback Zi Xiu, that old reprobate, besides knowing a few tricks with 'Verdant Curtain Serenity'**** and 'Live-Tear, Rend, Heavy Eagle Hand'*****, everything else isn't worth mentioning. Furthermore, his creativity gained from women isn't bad. Damn it, old Hunchback looks much uglier than me, yet there are women who are blind enough to like him. It's simply a cripple's asshole — crooked (evil)!'\"****** Nianbing completely mimicked Cha Ji's tone, vividly, as if Cha Ji himself were speaking there. Hunchback Chef Zi Xiu's face turned green then red, changing continuously.\n\n\"Oh, you, Cha Ji! You're dead, yet you're still speaking ill of me? *You're* the cripple's asshole! To evaluate me like that in front of a junior, hmph, just wait until I dig up your grave!\" Hearing Nianbing's words, Hunchback Chef Zi Xiu immediately flew into a rage, stomping his foot and cursing at Nianbing, pointing at his nose. But his tears, however, could no longer be controlled, streaming down his furious face.\n\nNianbing seemed not to have heard the Hunchback Chef's curses. He lowered his head and said, \"Master said that among the Five Great Knife Techniques, the last one, 'Verdant Curtain Serenity,' only you can wield to its complete realm. This is something he couldn't compare to. He also said that the Five Great Knife Techniques aren't actually ranked, and as long as they reach the perfect realm, they are all pinnacles of the culinary world. He also said that your 'Live-Tear, Rend, Heavy Eagle Hand,' ranked second among the Seven Great Forbidden Hands, is the only unique skill among all Seven Great Forbidden Hands that can prepare a dish purely by hand, which he couldn't match. In terms of subtle control over hand strength alone, you are definitely number one on the continent.\"\n___\n\\*   An epiphyllum is a flower that blooms only for a very short time, often at night, symbolizing something beautiful but fleeting.\n\\** Brocade Character Empty Window (錦字虛牖): A highly advanced knife skill/technique.\n\\*** Dragon Plume Gathering Dance (龍雩集舞): A highly advanced knife skill/technique.\n\\**** Verdant Curtain Serenity (翠幕端凝): A highly advanced knife skill/technique.\n\\***** Live-Tear, Rend, Heavy Eagle Hand (生撕活裂重鷹手): A unique culinary technique emphasizing precise hand strength and control.\n\\****** A cripple's asshole — crooked (evil)!

    "content": "Wiping the tears from his face, Zixiu snorted, saying, \"That's more like it. Even if your master were here now, he might not be able to match me. You brat, you've only been learning culinary arts for a few years and you want to challenge me? It's still a bit early. How about this: since I know the Brocade Character Illusionary Window and have probably learned a bit of the Dragon Dance Collection Dance, you can start by studying in the Culinary Department's fifth-year Hot Cuisine class. At the same time, like Xiaomeng, you'll also serve as a knife skills teacher. When you can surpass Xiaomeng in knife work, and surpass her brother Ziqing Jian in technique, I'll give you a chance. She and her brother have studied cooking with me for over ten years, inheriting my Heavy Hawk Hand and Verdant Curtain Condensing Technique respectively. While their mastery is still a bit lacking, they are rarely matched among the younger generation. As long as you can defeat them, you'll at least be comparable to seventy percent of my culinary skill.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly, saying, \"Then I'll follow your arrangements. However, I don't think it will be long before I can spar with you.\"\n\nZixiu looked Nianbing up and down, saying, \"It seems you're quite confident in yourself!\"\n\nNianbing said calmly, \"As the successor of the Ghost Chef, if I didn't even have a bit of confidence, wouldn't that diminish my master's reputation?\" When Cha Ji first introduced him to Camel Chef Zixiu, he had mentioned that Zixiu was extremely arrogant. Unless one could subdue him in his area of expertise, he would always remain overbearingly proud. Therefore, Nianbing's tone gradually became less reserved.\n\nZixiu stood up, saying, \"You've officially reported here. Two semesters a year: ten gold coins for tuition per semester, five gold coins for accommodation, five gold coins for food — a total of twenty gold coins. As a guest teacher, your income will be five gold coins per month, so I won't charge you any fees. However, don't expect me to pay you a salary either. As for the courses you wish to take, you can choose them yourself. Xiaomeng will inform you about your arrangements as a knife skills teacher. The Culinary Department building's first and second floors are for teaching, the third and fourth floors are dormitories, and the fifth floor is for teachers' offices. I imagine you won't need an office, so you can stay on the fourth floor for now. The Culinary Department doesn't have many students, so I can make an allowance and let you have a room to yourself.\"\n\nJust as Zixiu finished speaking, a deep voice suddenly came from outside, \"Second Uncle, Second Uncle! I heard there's a fellow here who knows the Brocade Character Illusionary Window knife technique. Where is he?\" The door flung open with a bang, and a tall figure charged in from outside. Seeing this person, Nianbing couldn't help but be startled. This man was a head taller than him, with extremely broad shoulders. To enter through the door, he not only had to duck his head but also turn sideways. A deep blue uniform tightly encased his solid muscles. His skin was dark, and he had a head of messy short red hair. His eyes were very bright. While he couldn't be called handsome, his resolute and sun-kissed face easily inspired goodwill. His entire being exuded a sense of power, especially his large hands, like palm-leaf fans, with extremely prominent knuckles. The moment he appeared, he immediately brought a powerful oppressive presence. Nianbing had no doubt that those hands could tear him apart.\n\n\"Xiaojian, can't you learn a bit from your sister? Always so reckless—how will you ever achieve anything great?\" Zixiu said impatiently.\n\nThe big man, called Xiaojian, completely ignored Zixiu. His gaze fell on Nianbing, and he said excitedly, \"Hello, are you the fellow who knows the Brocade Character Illusionary Window? My name is Ziqing Jian, you can just call me Xiaojian. Come on, let's spar and see who's the better chef.\" As he spoke, he went to pull Nianbing away.\n\nNianbing was startled, his arm flickering lightly as he dodged Ziqing Jian's grasp. \"This is Ziqing Meng's brother? My goodness! They don't look like they share the same mother.\"\n\n\"Xiaojian, what's the rush? He's not going anywhere; there will be plenty of opportunities later. You've arrived at just the right time. Take him to the fourth floor to find a dormitory to stay in first. As for his class schedule, let your sister arrange it; he's also temporarily a guest knife skills teacher. Nianbing, your name is Nianbing, right? Go with Ziqing Jian. Don't come looking for me unless it's important. And from now on, knock before coming to my office.\"\n\nZiqing Jian excitedly said, \"Uncle, stop rambling and go chase your women! Brother Nianbing is with me now. Let's go, Brother Nianbing.\" As he spoke, he again tried to pull Nianbing.\n\nRecalling Ziqing Meng's earlier words, Nianbing swiftly dodged Ziqing Jian's large hand, and said with a wry smile, \"Brother Ziqing Jian, I'll walk by myself. I haven't learned martial arts; I can't take a pull like that from you!\"\n\nZiqing Jian said somewhat awkwardly, \"Oh, I forgot you're not from the Martial Arts Department. I'll definitely be more mindful in the future.\" The two left the room and walked out. Ziqing Jian closed the door with a resounding bang.\n\nLooking at his office's shaking door, Camel Chef Zixiu said impatiently, \"Looks like I'll have to replace it with a pure iron one. Xiaomeng has interrupted my fun again. Cha Ji's apprentice actually showed up. From his appearance, he seems to have inherited some of Cha Ji's abilities. It seems the culinary world will likely be turbulent from now on. But it's true, it's time for a change of guard; us old farts are getting old after all. Cha Ji, you dead old man, to die so early, damn it, damn it.\" Zixiu no longer had any desire to chase women, and sat in his seat, staring blankly.\n\nLed by Ziqing Jian, Nianbing arrived at the fourth floor downstairs. The moment Ziqing Jian reached the fourth floor, he immediately bellowed, \"Floor Head Teacher! Floor Head Teacher!\" His booming voice made the entire hallway tremble slightly.\n\n\"Coming, coming! It's Ziqing Jian again, isn't it? Can't you be a bit quieter, you brat? You'll shake the hallway down sooner or later!\" A clear and pleasant voice, accompanied by a fragrant breeze, drifted towards them. When Nianbing saw the Floor Head's appearance, he couldn't help but be dumbfounded. For before him was a woman, and precisely the glamorous middle-aged woman he had seen earlier in Zixiu's room.\n\n\"Ziqing Jian, what now? Are you bringing this young man to find a dorm? I overheard a couple of things Xiaomeng said to the old man just now. Young man, welcome to the Culinary Department.\"\n\nAlthough he somewhat looked down on this woman, Nianbing still took the initiative to shake her hand, saying, \"Thank you for the trouble. The Department Head said I could have a room to myself.\"\n\nZiqing Jian said, \"Right, you can have a room to yourself. Each room here has two beds, so maybe one day when I come to spar with you, I can crash here too. Teacher Daji, please make it quick.\"\n\nDaji smiled faintly, saying, \"Then follow me.\" As she spoke, she produced a string of keys from somewhere, took one off, and handed it to Nianbing. She led them down the hallway, past over twenty doors, stopping at the door of a room marked \"4273\". \"Our department doesn't have many students, and some are from this city, so the dormitories are quite empty. You can stay here for now. Young man, what's your name?\"\n\n\"My name is Nianbing. Thank you, Teacher Daji.\"\n\nDaji's gaze lingered on Nianbing's handsome face for a second. \"Alright, go on in and rest. If you need anything in the future, just come directly to me. Remember, the third floor is the girls' dormitory; that's a no-go zone for men.\" With a meaningful smile on her face, she turned and left.\n\nOpening the door, Nianbing and Ziqing Jian entered his newly assigned dormitory. The room was large, about thirty square meters, furnished simply with two wardrobes, two chairs, two beds, and a table, yet it was quite clean. Ziqing Jian unceremoniously sat down on one of the chairs, his considerable weight immediately eliciting a groan from it. \"Brother Nianbing, when can I see your Brocade Character Illusionary Window? I heard Second Uncle mention before that the Five Great Techniques each have their own characteristics, and the Brocade Character Illusionary Window is an incredibly marvelous knife technique.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly, saying, \"I only know a bit of the basics. Brother Ziqing Jian, from your demeanor, it seems your relationship with your uncle isn't very harmonious!\"\n\n\"Not harmonious? How could that be? Although my uncle is much older than Xiaomeng and me, he's like a big kid. Aside from his improper behavior, there's nothing else to it. He himself asked us not to be so formal. Being with Uncle is much more relaxing than being with my father. Uncle is like our friend, even a brother. Nianbing, you're new here, so you might not understand things yet. You probably saw Teacher Daji in Uncle's office earlier, right? Don't think she's only a Floor Head here because of her connection to Uncle.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly, saying, \"I never underestimate anyone. Is Teacher Daji your uncle's wife?\"\n\nZiqing Jian shook his head, saying, \"No, my uncle doesn't have a wife at all. In his life, he's had countless women. Most of the female teachers with some allure in the academy have some kind of relationship with him. Teacher Daji specializes in teaching pastry and dessert in the Culinary Department; she's the Culinary Department's top pastry and dessert teacher. She came to work at the academy precisely because she was impressed by Uncle's culinary skills back then. If you've tasted her pastries and desserts, you'll definitely be hooked. She's taught Xiaomeng and me a lot of useful things. You can also learn more from her if you get the chance later.\"\n\nNianbing nodded, saying, \"I heard Senior Zixiu say that you learned the Rip-and-Tear Heavy Hawk Hand from him. I'd like to see it if I get the chance.\"\n\nZiqing Jian chuckled, saying, \"Originally, I wasn't interested in cooking in the slightest. Cooking, after all, should be a woman's job—Brother, no offense to you! Actually, it was precisely because of Uncle's Rip-and-Tear Heavy Hawk Hand that I chose to study culinary arts. You know, the Rip-and-Tear Heavy Hawk Hand is the only one of the Seven Forbidden Techniques in the culinary world that is based on martial arts. It can be used for cooking, and similarly, it can also be used for killing. Even my father doesn't know it; it's Uncle's exclusive secret technique. It'd be a pity not to learn it! The Verdant Curtain Condensing Knife Technique that my sister learned from it is also very helpful for her martial arts. I usually don't come to the Culinary Department for classes; I'm mostly in the Martial Arts Department. If you need to find me, just go there and ask for Xiaojian; my buddies all know me. No, I can't hold back anymore, Brother. Can you show me a little something first? I'm very curious about the Brocade Character Illusionary Window! My sister said that in an outside restaurant, you used the Brocade Character Illusionary Window to carve cucumbers, carving each piece into the character 'Meng,' so I immediately rushed over. Don't take it the wrong way; I'm just a bit reckless, and very interested in anything related to martial arts.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly, saying, \"Why would I mind? I like dealing with straightforward people like Brother Ziqing Jian. From your demeanor, your martial arts must be quite renowned in the academy, right?\"\n\nZiqing Jian scratched his head, saying, \"It's not bad. I'm the Heavy Sword class teacher in the Martial Arts Academy. If you're interested in martial arts, you can always come find me. However, you're a bit old to start martial arts now, but strengthening your body should still be fine. Your physical condition is good; if you practice well for a while, you should make some achievements.\"\n\nNianbing shook his head, saying, \"No need. I'm only interested in culinary arts. Thank you for your kindness. There are no ingredients here, so I can't demonstrate the Brocade Character Illusionary Window!\"\n\n\"Ingredients? That's simple! It's currently the time for afternoon classes. Come on, I'll take you to the Culinary Department's fifth-year teaching class. There's a knife skills class every afternoon. Didn't Uncle make you a knife skills teacher? You can just show what you can do. Anyone who can get into our academy has some ability. If you don't awe them first, it won't be easy to be a teacher later.\" He was a man of swift action; he did things as soon as he thought of them. This time, he didn't try to pull Nianbing; he stood up and walked out.",

    "title": "Chapter 49: The word \"六\" in the classroom (Part 1)",
    "content": "Nian Bing repeated the four characters, \"Lan Meng Academy,\" in his heart. It seemed he would be living here for a while. Master! Why wouldn't you tell me who our enemy was back then? But as your disciple, how could I let go of this hatred? As soon as I ask the Humpback Chef about the enemy's situation, I will definitely avenge your humiliation. She forced you to sever your hand tendons, so I will sever the tendons in all four of her limbs. Thinking this, a chilling aura unconsciously emanated from him. Having deeply buried his hatred since childhood, his likes and dislikes were completely different from ordinary people; everything was based solely on his own preferences. In front of outsiders, he was always kind, but his heart was like ice. Since his parents' downfall at the Ice God Tower, only two people had truly touched his heart: one was Ghost Chef Zha Ji, and the other was the beautiful woman who had once given him the Heavenly Splendor Card. As for everyone else, they were merely fleeting clouds in his eyes; at best, they were only appreciated.\n\nThe two arrived on the second floor. Zi Qingjian, keeping to his tradition of not knocking, pulled open the doors of classrooms one by one. After going through six classrooms, he finally found his target. \"Nian Bing, this is it. Come, follow me in.\" With that, he pushed open the classroom door and led Nian Bing inside.\n\nThe classroom was large, with over fifty students inside. Standing behind the podium was a middle-aged man in his forties. Upon seeing Zi Qingjian, he couldn't help but frown. \"Qingjian, what are you doing? Aren't you supposed to be teaching in your Martial Arts Department? Why are you here?\" Nian Bing's gaze fell on the podium. The podium was large, with a wide cutting board on it. On the table next to it were some vegetables and raw meat. In front of each student below the stage, aside from their tables being slightly lower than the podium, the items laid out were identical. It seemed they had just started class.\n\nZi Qingjian chuckled. \"Teacher Fan, don't be angry. Let me introduce you. Nian Bing, this is Fan Jian, Teacher Fan. But it's not 'fàn jiàn' (begging for trouble)<sup>1</sup>; it's 'Fan' as in the surname 'Fan,' and 'Jian' as in 'healthy.'\" His explanation only made things worse, immediately causing a burst of laughter from the students. Teacher \"Fàn Jiàn's\" face changed color repeatedly as he struggled to restrain himself. Zi Qingjian seemed not to notice his displeasure and continued, \"Teacher Fan, this Nian Bing is the new Knife Skills teacher. I brought him here for you to meet. And also for the students to get to know him.\"\n\nFan Jian looked at Nian Bing with some surprise. \"The new Knife Skills teacher?\" It wasn't just him who was surprised. The students below also showed astonished expressions. Before Nian Bing, Zi Qingmeng was Lan Meng Academy's youngest teacher. These Lan Meng Academy students were conceited, and Zi Qingmeng could keep them in check, first, because of her peerless beauty, and second, because her knife skills had truly reached a level of mastery. Now, with a new knife skills teacher, and one so young, it was indeed difficult for them to accept him.\n\nNian Bing nodded to Fan Jian. \"Hello, Teacher Fan. I've just arrived at the academy. Please look after me in the future.\"\n\nZi Qingjian said impatiently, \"Alright, enough with the pleasantries, Nian Bing, hurry up. Let me see your special skill. And let these kids below get a taste too.\"\n\nNian Bing shot Fan Jian an inquiring look. \"Is that alright, Teacher Fan?\" He knew very well that to establish himself in this academy and have a comfortable time for the foreseeable future, he had to show some real ability.\n\nFan Jian was quite angry about being interrupted during class, but Zi Qingjian held a very high position in the academy. Although he was usually friendly, it was extremely difficult to get him to endorse someone. Therefore, Fan Jian also wanted to see what kind of ability this Nian Bing actually possessed that could earn Zi Qingjian's strong endorsement. He gestured for Nian Bing to proceed. \"Since you are also a Knife Skills teacher in this department, we will be colleagues from now on. Please.\"\n\nNian Bing no longer stood on ceremony. He walked to the spot Fan Jian had vacated and looked at the more than fifty students below with a faint smile. \"Perhaps you think I am too young to be a teacher. But I only want to tell you one thing: age does not play a decisive role in the level of culinary skill. As the saying goes, 'the skilled come first.' If any of you believe your knife skills are better than mine, I will gladly yield this position at any time.\"\n\nAlthough his voice was calm, the subtle arrogance it conveyed permeated the entire room. Of course, a few words alone couldn't earn the students' approval. As soon as Nian Bing finished speaking, someone below heckled, \"Don't just talk; show us! Let's see what you've got to come here and brag.\"\n\nNian Bing raised his hand and pointed in the direction of the voice. \"This student, please stand up.\"\n\n\"I'll stand up, I'm not afraid of you.\" It was a student of short stature but a sturdy build. Perhaps due to frequent exercise, his muscles strained against the academy uniform. His short, dark red hair stood up like a hedgehog, and his face was full of disdain. Clearly, he did not acknowledge Nian Bing as a young teacher.\n\nZi Qingjian laughed and chided, \"Dunzi, it's you again, you troublemaker.\" He seemed quite familiar with this student.\n\nThe student called Dunzi chuckled. \"Brother Jian, I'm just not convinced. Could he really be as good as Sister Meng?\"\n\nZi Qingjian snorted. \"Just watch, you'll find out soon enough. Little Meng considers Nian Bing her biggest rival. You little rascal, always messing around instead of focusing in class. Tomorrow, in my Greatsword Class, I'll have a good spar with you.\"\n\nDunzi jumped in fright and waved his hands repeatedly. \"Forget it, forget it, I admit you can instant-kill me, isn't that enough? Brother Jian, you're the person I admire most in the academy besides the Headmaster! Do you have the heart to hurt my young body?\"\n\nThe classroom was once again filled with roaring laughter. Dunzi, describing himself as \"young,\" put on a contorted expression that made everyone burst out laughing.\n\nThe only one who didn't laugh was Nian Bing. After the laughter subsided, he picked up a kitchen knife from the table and weighed it in his hand. Although this knife was far inferior to his Aotian, it was much better than the one from the restaurant earlier. \"Dunzi, is it?\"\n\nDunzi snorted, puffing out his solid chest. \"That's right. So what? Are you going to hack me with that knife? You might not even be able to cut through me.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"I'm a Culinary Skills teacher, not a Martial Arts teacher. Since you've requested someone to hack you, I believe Brother Qingjian will grant your wish tomorrow. I asked you to stand up just to know your name. Alright, I know none of you are convinced. Perhaps most of you are even older than me. As long as any of you can replicate the knife skill I'm about to perform, I will immediately take him as my master. Otherwise, from now on, you must call me 'Teacher.' Remember my name, I am Nian Bing.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he picked up a relatively large carrot with his left hand. All the students, including Dunzi, fixed their gaze on Nian Bing. They all wanted to see what abilities this arrogant new teacher possessed.\n\nWith a faint smile, a cold glint appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. The five fingers of his right hand, holding the knife, moved slightly, his palm extending outwards, and the kitchen knife immediately began to spin in his hand. As his palm continuously pulsed, the speed of rotation grew faster and faster.\n\nDunzi stood there, scoffing. \"Is that it? I could swing a knife when I was three. With this little skill, he wants to be our teacher...\"\n\nNian Bing's despicable knife was still spinning. His gaze fell upon Dunzi, like two cold bolts of lightning flashing through the classroom. Dunzi suddenly felt a chill all over his body, unable to finish his sentence. Just then, Nian Bing moved. He truly moved.\n\nHis left hand, holding the carrot, spread open, laying the carrot flat on his palm. The knife light from his right hand approached the carrot, only its edge touching the carrot. The knife spun extremely fast, Nian Bing's right hand already leaving a blur due to the speed. There was no sound of cutting; everything remained silent. The knife light continuously swept back and forth over the carrot. Even Zi Qingjian couldn't clearly see what the knife's blur had done in that instant.\n\nNian Bing's hand was incredibly steady. The knife light shuttled back and forth, seemingly repeating the same motion. He looked up, no longer watching the knife and the carrot, and his gaze swept across the entire classroom. \"What is the fundamental of knife skills? It is stability. Without a steady hand, even if you occasionally achieve good results, it cannot be called mature knife work. The key to this set of knife techniques is in the 'picking' (挑)<sup>2</sup> character. If you're capable, watch carefully. Just mouthing off will only ever make you a mediocrity. Brother Qingjian, this is the Brocade Character Hollow Window<sup>3</sup> you wanted to see.\"\n\nHearing the four words \"Brocade Character Hollow Window,\" Fan Jian trembled all over, a look of horror appearing in his eyes.\n\nThe knife light suddenly vanished, and the rotation stopped. Nian Bing's knife-holding hand began to make an unusual tremor. The knife tip continuously picked at the carrot, and fine, uniform red scraps appeared on the cutting board. His left hand, supporting the carrot, remained motionless under the knife's light. The carrot itself seemed not to need to move; only the knife light flashed ceaselessly around it. At this moment, the trembling knife light was even faster than the previous rapid spin. Aside from an afterimage, no one could see anything else.\n\nThud—, the knife light disappeared, and the kitchen knife was stuck vertically into the cutting board. All trembling ceased. A few beads of sweat appeared on Nian Bing's forehead, and his breathing was slightly hurried. He slowly extended his left arm, presenting the carrot to all the students. \"Dunzi, tell me, what do you see now?\"\n\nDunzi looked at the carrot in confusion. \"A carrot! You made big pits and small holes all over it with your knife. Is that your whatever-it-is knife technique?\" Nian Bing's aura had already suppressed him earlier, and with Zi Qingjian's intimidating presence nearby, he dared not mock easily again.\n\nIndeed, as Dunzi said, the carrot had become pitted and uneven, but it still looked like a carrot, without the slightest unusual characteristic. A hint of disappointment appeared in Zi Qingjian's eyes. Only Fan Jian's eyes flickered, wanting to say something but unable to confirm his thoughts, making a hesitant gesture.\n\n\"To master knife skills, first, you must train your eyes. If you can't even see what I did, then your five years of culinary study haven't been deep enough.\" Nian Bing extended his right hand, pinched the top of the carrot, and lifted it. His free left hand also pinched the top. His gaze swept across the room. At this moment, an overbearing aura emanated from him, an aura born of confidence. With a gentle shake of both hands, separating them to the sides, a strange scene unfolded.\n\nThe originally pitted and uneven carrot, at this moment, naturally spread apart, like a piece of cloth—no, more accurately, it was like a piece of red silk, unfolding lightly and gracefully. There was no fragmentation at all. The originally conical carrot had actually turned into a piece of cloth, one meter square. And on the cloth, one hundred identical patterns were carved: two characters—\"Dunzi.\"\n\nDunzi rubbed his eyes several times, then tried to open them as wide as possible. \"Th-this is impossible! This isn't knife skills; it must be magic! It has to be magic!\"\n\nNian Bing gently placed the red silk made from the carrot onto the cutting board. \"Have you ever heard of such magic? There's nothing impossible in the world; it just depends on whether you dare to do it, whether you dare to imagine it. If you don't try, how do you know you'll fail? In the Ice Moon Empire to the north, there's an art called paper-cutting. A simple piece of paper, after being folded, only needs a few small parts to be cut away, and when unfolded, strange patterns appear. This knife technique of mine is derived from paper-cutting, focusing on characters and perfectly embodying the 'picking' technique within knife skills. Carrots are very simple ingredients. This is nothing. This Brocade Character Hollow Window knife technique can only truly show its essence on soft surfaces. All of you are still far from that. Teacher Fan, I apologize for disturbing you. Please continue with your class.\" After speaking, Nian Bing pulled the dumbfounded Zi Qingjian and exited the classroom.\n\nThey left, but the entire classroom remained dead silent. Dunzi rubbed his eyes repeatedly, but the carrot displayed there was still incredibly magical.\n\nFan Jian returned to the podium. His gaze swept over the students. \"Classmates, what do you think of what just happened? Who can tell me?\"\n\nA student who was usually friendly with Dunzi said, \"Teacher Fan, I know! That teacher named Nian Bing must have prepared a piece of silk beforehand, then just made a few gestures with the knife, and swapped the carrot for the silk before showing it to us.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Which eye saw him swap silk? Come over here and eat all one hundred 'Dunzi's' and see if it kills you!\" Fan Jian was furious. \"You bunch of good-for-nothings, usually so arrogant! What, today you see real skill and you slander him? This carrot is from here, the knife is from here. Teacher Nian Bing didn't even know Dunzi before this. This lively knife skills lesson was to let you know that 'there's always someone better, and new heights to reach'<sup>4</sup>. Do you know what the Brocade Character Hollow Window is? Who can tell me?\"\n***\n<sup>1</sup> 'Fan Jian' (范健) is a homophone for 'fàn jiàn' (犯賤), a colloquial term meaning 'begging for trouble,' 'cheap,' or 'bitchy.' The original text plays on this phonetic similarity for humor.\n<sup>2</sup> 'Picking' (挑, tiǎo) refers to a specific knife technique where the tip of the blade is used to lift, pry, or carve.\n<sup>3</sup> 'Brocade Character Hollow Window' (錦字虛牖): 'Jǐn zì' (錦字) means 'brocade characters' or 'embroidered characters,' referring to intricate, artistic writing. 'Xū yǒu' (虛牖) literally means 'empty window' or 'hollow window.' The name suggests a technique that creates delicate, intricate, and potentially multi-layered patterns or characters, possibly with internal spaces, as if carved into a 'window.'\n<sup>4</sup> 'There's always someone better, and new heights to reach' (人外有人、天外有天, rén wài yǒu rén, tiān wài yǒu tiān): A Chinese idiom meaning that there's always someone more skilled or powerful than you, and that there are always new levels of achievement or knowledge to attain. It encourages humility and continuous learning.",

    "title": "Chapter 49: The word \"六\" in the classroom (Part 2)",
    "content": "The students looked at each other blankly, no one able to utter a word.\n\nFan Jian said coldly, \"You all don't know, do you? Many of you were specially sent by various hotels across the continent to study at the academy, but with your limited experience, you will never reach the pinnacle of culinary intent. In the culinary intent world of the continent, there are five wondrous knife techniques. In my opinion, the miraculousness of these five techniques is no less than any top-tier martial art, perhaps even superior. Listen carefully, these five techniques are: Dragon Sepal Dance [龍萼集舞], Clean Fire Sunset Glow [潔火夕照], Eight Plume Splendid Courtyard [八羽華庭], Brocade Character Illusionary Flow [錦字虛鱅], and Verdant Curtain Dignified Gaze [翠幕端凝]. What Teacher Nian Bing demonstrated earlier was the Brocade Character Illusionary Flow knife technique, ranked fourth. Although he is young, he is more than qualified to be your teacher. I admit, his knife technique is far beyond mine. I won't waste any more words. Whether you have the ability to learn true knife skills from Teacher Nian Bing depends on your own capability. Class dismissed.\"\n\nNian Bing, holding Zi Qingjian's hand, walked out of the Culinary Arts Department building before letting go, smiling faintly. \"Are the students at Lan Meng Academy all this difficult to teach? It seems being a teacher is really not easy!\"\n\nZi Qingjian looked at Nian Bing with a strange expression. \"Brother, I'm convinced. That move you just pulled off was truly miraculous. No wonder Brocade Character Illusionary Flow has always ranked above Verdant Curtain Dignified Gaze; it truly cannot compare!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Actually, I took a bit of a shortcut just now. This overlapping character method isn't difficult. Each cut can be used to leverage the next. If I had to carve out individual characters directly from the radish, it would be much harder. This is merely about mastering the heat control. With more practice, you'll naturally succeed.\" Indeed, although the effect he demonstrated with the overlapping character method earlier was impressive, it wasn't the essence of Brocade Character Illusionary Flow. The actual number of cuts was far fewer. When he began rotating the kitchen knife, it was to layer the carrot like paper. Then, picking out some key parts completed it. It looked very intimidating, but this was only the foundation of the Brocade Character Illusionary Flow knife technique. The most important aspect of it is familiarity with character forms.\n\n\"Alright, brother, stop being modest. I need to go find my sister immediately. I'm sure her knife skills can't compare to yours. That girl always looks down on everyone. I really want to see her reaction when she hears about your feat just now, haha. Brother, you go wait for me at the Dean's Office on the second floor of the main building. I'll bring my sister over to find you later, and also help you pick up your uniform.\" With that, without waiting for Nian Bing's reply, he ran off like the wind. Without any shimmering of fighting qi, purely by his body's strength, his speed had reached a terrifying degree. Nian Bing secretly estimated that Zi Qingjian's martial arts had reached at least the level of a Great Swordsman.\n\nNian Bing moved his hand, full of confidence. His knife skills hadn't regressed due to infrequent practice. Instead, they had been enlightened by the insights gained from his experiences since leaving the Peach Blossom Forest, coupled with a certain improvement in his spiritual power. It seemed he was not far from the highest realm of Brocade Character Illusionary Flow. \"Sigh, when will I be able to master Dragon Sepal Dance to its extreme? That's truly too difficult. Right now, my Dragon Sepal Dance only has its form but not its spirit. Fortunately, I saw a real dragon that time. I should practice it when I have the chance; maybe it will bring new enlightenment.\"\n\nThinking this, he walked towards the large parade ground outside. Arriving at a new place, he always felt the need to familiarize himself with the environment. He just didn't know about the communication with the outside world here. As soon as the war ended, he had to rush to Olan City. After fulfilling Luo Rou's request, and before participating in the Rising Star Magician Competition, he would be completely free.\n\nLost in thought, Nian Bing arrived at the vast parade ground ahead. The entire academy gave him a very relaxed feeling, especially this huge parade ground. Looking out into the distance, his heart felt much more open. The Culinary Arts Academy here had not disappointed him; at least he had met the Humpback Chef Zi Xiu here. Once he was completely familiar with the place, he would certainly challenge him.\n\n\"Young man, are you new here?\" An old voice sounded beside Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing was startled, secretly scolding himself for his low vigilance. With his spiritual power, he hadn't even noticed someone standing beside him. He turned his head towards the source of the voice and saw an old man standing there. He had long blue-gray hair, wore a simple cloth robe, and held a broom, slowly sweeping the ground. The old man looked somewhat familiar, yet Nian Bing was certain he had never seen him before. The old man's tall figure had become somewhat gaunt, but his eyes were peculiar; his purple eyes were exceptionally clear, without any of the dimness common to old age. If not for the wrinkles on his face and his frail demeanor, Nian Bing really couldn't tell his age.\n\n\"Hello, I just arrived at the academy today. I'm a student in the Culinary Arts Department.\" Although the old man looked like a janitor, Nian Bing was very polite. Cha Ji had once told him not to underestimate anyone, especially those you couldn't see through. Respecting others was respecting oneself. Of course, if the object of respect was not worthy of it, that was another matter.\n\nThe old man nodded and said, \"I wondered why I hadn't seen you before. It seems you have a lot on your mind!\"\n\nNian Bing was surprised. He prided himself on always concealing his true self deeply. Had his unintentional display earlier revealed something? He said somewhat cautiously, \"It is my honor to be able to study at Lan Meng Academy. The learning atmosphere here puts a lot of pressure on me. I'm pondering how to study better. Please forgive my gaffe.\"\n\nThe old man cast a meaningful glance at Nian Bing and said, \"Go quickly and get your school uniform. Only after wearing it will you truly become a part of Lan Meng.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Thank you. I'll go now.\" With that, he turned and walked towards the main building at the edge of the parade ground. As he walked, he faintly heard the old man muttering to himself behind him, \"Sweeping feels truly good, especially the rustling sound when the broom touches the ground. This is the sound of nature. The most basic work can bring me the greatest pleasure.\"\n\nHis heart stirred, Nian Bing didn't stop walking, but he pondered the old man's words. What did he mean? Basics, basics, yes! How could I forget the basics? When I studied culinary arts with my master, I spent five years learning the basics. Master even said at the time that the time was a bit short. With the best foundation, learning other culinary arts would be much easier. Magic was the same. Magical power was the foundation. My excessive pursuit of magic arrays and magic scrolls might only lead to temporary power, but I would never reach the pinnacle of magic. Maomao's father had also reminded me of this point, but I had ignored it.\n\nThese days, although Nian Bing still maintained his meditation habit every day, most of his thoughts were focused on magic arrays and understanding the shared origin of ice and fire. Even the best techniques need a foundation. I understand now, I understand. Whether it's culinary arts or magic, what I need to do now is still basic practice.\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing's mind suddenly brightened. He abruptly stopped, wanting to go back and thank the old man, but when he turned around, the old man was already gone. Elusive as a divine dragon – that was Nian Bing's assessment of him.\n\nArriving in front of the main academic building, he was about to enter when he was stopped by two students standing at the entrance. They weren't dressed as soldiers like the guards at the academy gate. The two looked at his attire, and one of them said, \"Who are you? What are you doing at our academy?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Hello, I'm a new student. I'm here to pick up my school uniform.\"\n\nThe student asked doubtfully, \"To pick up a school uniform, you need a teacher to accompany you. Why are you alone? Sorry, you can't go in. Which department are you from? Let a teacher from that department bring you to pick up your uniform, otherwise, we cannot let you in.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned slightly. Just then, a cold and crisp voice sounded from behind him. \"He's from our department. I'll take him in.\" Turning around, he saw Zi Qingjian and his sister walking over together.\n\nUpon seeing the siblings, the two students quickly saluted and moved aside. Zi Qingmeng looked at Nian Bing with a strange gaze and said, \"Sorry, those are the academy's rules. Big Brother, really, he forgot about this. Come in with us.\"\n\nZi Qingjian looked a little embarrassed. Nian Bing smiled faintly. \"It's fine, I was going to wait for you anyway.\"\n\nThe three entered the academic building together. As they went upstairs, Nian Bing looked around. He noticed that each classroom door in this building had a sign, seemingly indicating a class in the Martial Arts Department.\n\nZi Qingjian explained to Nian Bing, \"Because our Martial Arts Department is the largest department in the academy, we use the main academic building. Only the eighth floor belongs to the Magic Department. They have the fewest people, only a little over a hundred students.\"\n\nMagic Department? Nian Bing's heart stirred slightly. With a Magic Department, this Lan Meng Academy should have a library. He would have to check it out if he had the chance. \"Brother Qingjian, does the academy have a library?\"\n\nZi Qingjian chuckled. \"Of course, it does! And they're separated by department. Your Culinary Arts Department library is in your own academic building. Our Martial Arts Department library is the smallest, because the teachers all say that if students learn too many disparate things, it's not good for their development. On the other hand, the smallest Magic Department has a dedicated library in the academy, and it's very large. However, only students from the Magic Department can enter.\"\n\nLooking at the somewhat adorably straightforward Zi Qingjian, Nian Bing's favorable impression grew. He was now hesitating whether to continue concealing the fact that he could use magic. Was it necessary? If he wanted to find out who his master's enemy was, he had to defeat Humpback Chef Zi Xiu. Without using his most proficient magic culinary arts, it would probably be difficult to achieve. Since that was the case, there was no point in continuing to hide it. Anyway, he wouldn't be staying here for too long.\n\nUnder the guidance of the Zi Qingjian siblings, he successfully received a school uniform and a teacher's badge. After leaving the Dean's Office, Zi Qingmeng, who had been silent since helping Nian Bing earlier, finally spoke. \"Nian Bing, I want to spar with you in knife skills.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"I also want to spar with Miss Qingmeng's Verdant Curtain Dignified Gaze knife technique, but let's not do it today. I just arrived here and I'm a bit tired. Once I'm familiar with the environment, there will be plenty of opportunities later.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng was clearly surprised that Nian Bing would refuse a challenge. She frowned slightly and said, \"You're a grown man, are you that fragile?\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"I'm not like you, I haven't cultivated martial arts. Why can't my body be a little more fragile?\"\n\nZi Qingmeng's purple eyes shone brightly as she said coldly, \"Are you still holding a grudge about what happened at the hotel?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"I'm not that petty. Miss Qingmeng, may I know if I can choose to study courses from another department, like you two?\"\n\nZi Qingmeng was stunned for a moment and said, \"You want to choose an elective?\" Obviously, she was very surprised, but she quickly returned to normal. \"Then what do you want to study? As long as you can pass the test, you can choose any course from any department in this academy, but only one.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and turned to Zi Qingjian. \"Brother Qingjian, could I trouble you to introduce me to the Magic Department for a test? I want to study magic.\"\n\nZi Qingjian said in surprise, \"Brother, are you mistaken? Magic is extremely difficult to get started with. I think if you want to learn a self-defense skill, it's better to learn some martial arts from me. With my connections, you won't even need a test. The teachers over in the Magic Department are all quite rigid; you must pass a test to enter the Magic Department.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng said, \"Big Brother is right. Although magic looks more flashy, its practical use is far inferior to martial arts. I think you should choose martial arts instead. Otherwise, unless you spend a lot of time cultivating magic, you might only achieve some results, but then your culinary skills would surely be neglected.\"\n\nNian Bing held out his right hand. \"You don't need to persuade me. In fact, although my main profession is a chef, I am also a magician. Look.\" A flash of light in his hand, and under the control of his spiritual power, the Ice Spire Staff quietly appeared in his palm. Under the activation of magical power, the surrounding air immediately became cold.\n\n\"How is this possible?\" Zi Qingmeng looked at the magic staff in Nian Bing's hand, unable to believe the fact.\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"I once said in the Culinary Arts Department class that there is nothing impossible in the world, only whether you want to do it and dare to try. Alright, the Magic Department is on the eighth floor, right? Miss Qingmeng, I won't trouble you. Brother Qingjian, please take me.\"",

    "content": "Zi Qingjian's surprise was less than his sister's. He was straightforward. Although Nian Bing knowing magic also surprised him, recalling that he and his sister also cultivated both martial arts and culinary skills, he didn't suspect much and headed straight for the stairs.\n\nNian Bing was about to follow Zi Qingjian when Zi Qingmeng said, \"I'm going with you. I want to see what level your magic is. There are similarities between martial arts and culinary skills, especially my elder brother's Heavy Eagle Hand and my sword techniques. But there seems to be no connection between magic and culinary skills, right? I don't believe you're a genius who can focus on two things at once.\"\n\nFrom the first moment he met Zi Qingmeng, Nian Bing had fully witnessed her arrogance. Looking at her unusually cold and haughty pretty face, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a little annoyed. From his heart, he still preferred personalities like Feng Nü and Long Ling. Long Ling was gentle as water, and Feng Nü was gentle yet firm, both relatively easy to accept. However, the Zi Qingmeng before him bore some resemblance to Luo Rou; because of her own considerable abilities in certain aspects, she had developed a supercilious attitude. For such women, Nian Bing was truly too lazy to even bother. Without further interaction with Zi Qingmeng, he chased after Zi Qingjian.\n\nThe magic department was unique in the entire Lan Meng Academy. Including the students' dormitories, and the core magic laboratory which was the teaching location, all were on the eighth floor of the main teaching building. As soon as one stepped onto the eighth floor, they could immediately feel various strong magic elements filling the corridor. Upon careful observation, one could discern that the reason for the strong magic elements was mainly due to the relief carvings on the walls. These were simple magic array patterns. However, in the center of each magic array, there were different complex symbols, representing various magic elements respectively. Surrounded by these symbols, a magic gem was displayed in the center of the array. Although not top-grade, under the effect of the magic arrays, the energy of these gems could be magnified to exhibit the effect of condensing magic elements.\n\n\"What a strong magical atmosphere, comparable to the Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild!\" Nian Bing sighed inwardly. Even at the Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild, there were no such relief carvings! It wasn't because the carvings were difficult to make, but because the Guild simply lacked the financial resources to purchase large quantities of magic gems. Just as Long Ling had said back then, money was the biggest obstacle restricting the development of the Magician's Guild.\n\n\"Every time I come here, I feel a bit stifled. Yet those guys from the magic department enjoy it immensely,\" Zi Qingjian said with some dissatisfaction.\n\n\"Stifled?\" Nian Bing suddenly realized. It was probably because the density of magic elements here was too high. Non-magicians would naturally feel oppressed under the pressure of various magic elements. If one could cultivate magic here, it would indeed be very beneficial for magicians.\n\n\"Boom—\" A sudden loud noise from Magic Department Classroom No. 3 beside them startled Nian Bing. Although the sound was very loud, there was no accompanying vibration.\n\n\"Idiot, how did you practice your magic control? You can't even control a Blast Flame. Do you want to blow up everyone here?\" An angry roar rang out. The booming voice was comparable to Zi Qingjian's.\n\nZi Qingjian stopped, and whispered to Nian Bing, \"I wonder which student is unlucky again. That voice belongs to the Director of the Magic Department. He's known as the most powerful Archmage in history. Whether you can enter the Magic Department depends on passing his assessment.\"\n\n\"The most powerful Archmage in history? Not Grand Archmage? No matter how strong an Archmage is, they can't compare to a Grand Archmage, right?\" Nian Bing looked at Zi Qingjian in confusion.\n\nZi Qingjian shrugged his broad shoulders. \"I don't know that either. You'd better ask him yourself. I don't understand magic, but anyway, that title of his is recognized throughout the continent, it's not something he just called himself.\"\n\n\"Who's making a ruckus outside, disturbing my class?\" Amidst the angry roar, a fist-sized fireball flew out from the window, tracing a graceful arc, and accurately dropped towards Zi Qingjian's head.\n\nThe sudden arrival of the fireball startled Zi Qingjian. Just as he was about to activate his dou qi to block it, a blue light intercepted it in front of him. Nian Bing swung his right hand forward, his Ice Rod, imbued with rich ice elements, touched the fist-sized fireball. His whole body trembled slightly, and the fireball vanished in a minor shockwave, while Nian Bing was pushed back a step. A storm immediately erupted in his heart. He had always prided himself on his magic control being far superior to his peers, but this fireball simultaneously possessed several unique properties that ordinary fireball spells lacked, as if changing according to one's will. A first-tier magic spell, upon contact with his Ice Rod, surprisingly produced a sticking and bursting effect, exploding suddenly while sticking. Although its power was still that of a first-tier magic spell, it split into three phases at the moment of explosion, and the impact force, which should have dispersed in all directions, condensed into a single direction, actually pushing back his confidently cast Ice Spell by a step. Being of the same first-tier magic, he had already fallen short. If this were a high-tier magic spell, he feared it would be very difficult to resist given the disparity. Instantly analyzing the reason for his retreat, Nian Bing immediately shed his arrogance.\n\nZi Qingjian loudly said, \"Director Hei, it's me! How can you attack indiscriminately?\" As he spoke, he pushed open the classroom door and glared inside in annoyance.\n\nZi Qingjian was simply too tall and large. Standing behind him, Nian Bing couldn't see anything, only hearing the voice from inside the classroom earlier say, \"Ah, it's Little Zi! Who told you to sneakily disturb my class? Can't you look for me when I don't have a class? You wait outside first. We'll talk after my class is over.\"\n\nZi Qingjian said, \"Sorry for disturbing you. I'll wait for you outside.\" With that, he quickly retreated. As he exited the classroom, Nian Bing vaguely saw that it was a very large classroom, with at least a hundred people seated inside. It seemed all students from the Magic Department must be in there. From Zi Qingjian's attitude towards Director Hei, it was clear that this Director of the Magic Department held a very high position in the Academy.\n\nClosing the classroom door, Zi Qingjian turned back and smiled at Nian Bing, saying, \"Brother, so you really are a magician! We'll just have to wait for a bit now; Director Hei doesn't have a very good temper.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"No problem, we'll just wait a bit.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng looked at Nian Bing with a strange gaze. \"What level of magician are you?\"\n\nNian Bing said indifferently, \"I don't know either, but passing the Magic Department's assessment shouldn't be a problem. Brother Qingjian, I heard that the Huarong Empire and the Qilu Empire have allied to launch a war against Aolan. Do you know about this?\"\n\nZi Qingjian nodded and said, \"I just heard about it yesterday. The situation this time is quite dire! Now, we can only hope that the reinforcements from the Ice Moon Empire can make a difference. I really want to go to the battlefield and see. But the Dean doesn't allow non-graduates to participate in war, and I'm a teacher, so I can't leave. Warriors should throw themselves into war to truly embody their value. After I finish teaching this batch of students, I must join the Empire's strongest Silver Feather Knights and fully utilize my expertise.\" As he spoke, a look of longing appeared in his eyes; he was absolutely a warmonger.\n\nNian Bing didn't ask further questions. He wasn't interested in war at all. The three of them waited silently at the classroom door.\n\nA full half an hour later, the magic bell rang, and class was finally dismissed.\n\nThe door opened, and the magic students filed out. Their attire was different from students of other departments; they all wore junior magician's robes, but the color was deep blue. Only on their chests were magic gems representing different elements inlaid, to show their cultivated magic attribute. The students' expressions were all indifferent. Not a single one greeted Zi Qingjian and his sister; they all dispersed in another direction on the eighth floor. Walking at the very back was an elderly magician, with a head full of white hair and a wrinkled face, looking at least seventy or eighty years old. His build was small, and his dim yellow eyes looked at the three of them at the door. \"Come in.\" The booming voice, contrasting with his small build, gave a strange impression. On the chest of his red magician's robe was a golden flame symbol. A Fire Archmage?\n\n\"Director Hei, I've brought you a new student. He just joined the Culinary Department and wants to take the Magic Department as an elective. Do you think that's alright?\" Zi Qingjian said courteously.\n\n\"Take the Magic Department as an elective? A cook wants to learn magic too?\" Director Hei's dim yellow eyes suddenly flickered with cold, lightning-like rays as he stared at Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing met his gaze without showing any weakness. Although he felt as if he was being seen through, he barely managed to control his gaze, not yielding in the slightest.\n\nA hint of surprise appeared in Director Hei's eyes. \"Then let's try it. Kid, was it you who blocked my Fireball spell just now?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Hello, Director Hei.\"\n\nDirector Hei's gaze swept over Zi Qingjian and his sister. \"You two can leave. He can stay by himself.\"\n\nZi Qingjian smiled faintly. \"Then we'll trouble you. Little sister, let's go.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng blinked her large purple eyes. To everyone's surprise, the cold arrogance on her face had vanished, replaced by a warm smile that seemed capable of melting all coldness. She walked to Director Hei's side and proactively linked her arm through his thin arm. \"Uncle Hei, can I watch your test of him? Please let my brother and me stay.\"\n\nA faint smile appeared on Director Hei's face. \"You persistent girl, you don't even study magic, what's the point of watching?\" Although he didn't agree, his tone had softened considerably.\n\n\"No, I want to watch! Uncle Hei, at worst, I'll cook you a delicious meal to make it up to you. Don't you like drinking? Tonight, I'll prepare some appetizers for you.\"\n\n\"Alright, if you want to watch, then watch.\" Director Hei looked somewhat helplessly at the beautiful woman who was more than half a head taller than himself.\n\nNian Bing said, \"Director Hei, how will you test me then?\"\n\nDirector Hei glanced at the Ice Rod in Nian Bing's hand and said, \"You're an Ice Elementalist, alright. As long as you can use a second-tier magic spell to break my first-tier Flame Spell, you pass.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he raised his withered left hand, and a dark red flame surged up. It was indeed just an ordinary Flame Spell.\n\nNian Bing didn't feel this test was simple at all. The higher the magic tier, the greater the gap between high-tier and low-tier magic spells. While there was a gap between second-tier and first-tier magic, it was far less than the gap between high-tier spells. He had already experienced the Archmage's magic control earlier, and breaking his first-tier Flame Spell with a second-tier Ice Element magic spell would definitely not be as easy as it seemed. Without saying much, Nian Bing raised the Ice Rod in his hand, observed his surroundings, and had already thought of a good method.\n\nA faint blue light gradually intensified. Under the effect of low, rhythmic incantations, second-tier ice bullets continuously formed in front of Nian Bing. He wasn't in a hurry to attack; he merely kept condensing the ice bullets.\n\n\"Kid, if you use Ice Bullet Rain, that's a third-tier magic spell,\" Director Hei reminded Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"As long as I don't attack all at once, it shouldn't count as Ice Bullet Rain, right?\" By now, more than ten ice bullets had appeared in front of him. With his Ice Rod pointed forward, a flash of light, and an ice bullet suddenly flew towards the flame in Director Hei's hand.\n\nDirector Hei calmly watched Nian Bing. The flame in his hand suddenly contracted to one-third of its previous volume. Just as the ice bullet was about to approach, the flame expanded from small to large with a \"poof.\" However, it didn't push the ice bullet away as expected. The rapidly charging ice bullet suddenly stopped a foot away from the flame. When the flame expanded, the ice bullet suddenly burst open, turning into a mist of ice that enveloped the first-tier flame. Under the effect of the ice mist, the flame immediately dimmed. Just as it was about to extinguish, it suddenly contracted and expanded, forcefully pushing the ice mist apart.\n\n\"Elastic Flame. Your magic control is truly admirable.\" A hint of respect appeared in Nian Bing's eyes, and the second ice bullet flew out.\n\nDirector Hei's eyes also showed surprise; Nian Bing's control over the Ice Bullet spell had exceeded his expectations. At this moment, the second ice bullet had arrived. Director Hei contracted the flame in his hand to its smallest extent, retracting but not releasing, responding to all changes with constancy. Just then, Nian Bing displayed his precise magic control. The ice bullet flying in the air paused seven times, and accelerated seven times, constantly changing its direction and speed. Although it was just one ice bullet, it gave the impression of infinite variations.\n\nThe distance grew shorter. When the ice bullet suddenly accelerated and charged to a meter in front of Director Hei, it suddenly underwent a huge transformation. The entire ice bullet instantly compressed into an ice needle, shooting like lightning towards Director Hei's forehead at three times its previous speed, completely disregarding the flame in his hand.",

    "content": "The urgent Ice Needle, just a meter away, left Director Hei with very little space to dodge. Only in a crisis could a mage's magical strength be truly seen. A layer of pale yellow light enveloped Director Hei's face, turning his skin earthy yellow. However, this suddenly appearing, strange magic was not affected by the Ice Needle's attack. The Ice Needle, just as it was about to strike Director Hei, suddenly burst, transforming into a cloud of ice mist that blocked his vision. Director Hei inwardly thought, 'Not good!' Before he could react, his left hand trembled, and the Fireball, sensed by his spiritual power, had already vanished.\n\nAs the ice mist dissipated, Director Hei looked at Nian Bing with burning eyes. \"What a feinting with mother-son linked bullets!¹ You've passed the test.\"\n\nNian Bing was currently staring blankly at Director Hei, a look of horror in his eyes. Director Hei gave him a wink, and he gradually returned to normal, hastily bowing and saying, \"A Second Rank against a First Rank, this student won by luck.\"\n\nThe changes that occurred earlier were extremely fast. Zi Qingjian and his sister only saw Nian Bing cast three ice bullets, and then the Fireball in Director Hei's hand extinguished. Unable to understand magic, they naturally couldn't see the secrets within.\n\nDirector Hei nodded to Nian Bing and said, \"Young man, what's your name?\"\n\nNian Bing replied, \"My name is Nian Bing.\"\n\nDirector Hei said, \"From today on, you are a student of the Magic Department. I am Hei Ye, the department head of the Magic Department, an Archmage² of the Fire Element. Since you're taking magic as an elective, you should come to classes frequently. Qingjian, Qingmeng, you two may leave first. I have something to discuss privately with this new student.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng was momentarily stunned. Just as she was about to say something, she felt the coldness emanating from Hei Ye's body and knew there was no room for discussion. She could only let go of Hei Ye's arm and walk towards the door. As she passed Nian Bing, she whispered to him, \"Coward, I'm waiting for your challenge anytime, be it in culinary arts or martial arts.\" With that, she recomposed her steps and pulled her brother away.\n\nWith a bang, the classroom door closed. In the vast magic classroom, only Nian Bing and Archmage Hei Ye remained. Neither spoke, observing each other. After a long while, Hei Ye spoke first. \"You've already figured it out, haven't you? I never expected a simple test to reveal my capabilities. Your magic control ability truly exceeded my expectations.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"Director Hei, your magic also greatly astonished me. No wonder Big Brother Qingjian said you are the most powerful Archmage. What's more, your dual-element magic, its combination is so harmonious.\" Yes, the reason he had been stunned earlier was precisely because he had discovered Hei Ye's secret. The magic Hei Ye cast to block the Ice Needle was not fire-element. It was the Earth-element Second Rank Three-Stone Skin Spell, which could instantly make his skin as hard as stone. With both Fire and Earth elements appearing on one person, how could he not be surprised?\n\nHei Ye smiled faintly. \"The most powerful Archmage, haha, the most powerful Archmage. I can only ever be an Archmage. Do you think having dual elements is a pleasant thing?\"\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile. \"Of course not, otherwise, I wouldn't need to be troubled.\" As he spoke, he simultaneously raised both hands, an ice ball and a fireball appearing in his respective palms.\n\nThis time, it was Hei Ye's turn to be surprised. \"You? Impossible? Ice, Fire. Could it be that you are...\"\n\nNian Bing sighed softly. \"That's right, I'm also a dual-element mage. However, I'm not as fortunate as you. Fire and Earth don't repel each other, and one is the strongest defensive magic while the other is the strongest offensive magic. The two complement each other, allowing you to maximize your strength. My two elements, however, must constantly be wary of their mutual conflict.\" Hei Ye was the first dual-element mage he had met. The reason he didn't hide his greatest secret was because he desperately wanted to learn some of the mysteries of dual-element magic from Hei Ye.\n\nHei Ye's eyes flashed repeatedly. After a long while, he said in a deep voice, \"Which scoundrel is your teacher? Didn't he notice that your body possessed two affinities³ when you first started cultivating magic? Cultivating both Ice and Fire isn't just a matter of enhancing strength; it's a matter of potentially losing your life at any moment.\"\n\nNian Bing replied, \"Director Hei, that has nothing to do with my teacher. I initially learned magic from my father, and there I only studied fire-element magic. Later, something happened to my father, and I had no one to guide me, so I had to grope my way through cultivation for eight years. During these eight years, I inadvertently developed ice-element magic. Although I later realized it was inappropriate, there was no way to change it. My teacher also said that these two elements of mine are very dangerous, but they don't threaten my life for now. You are also a dual-element mage, so is there no way to resolve the conflict between Ice and Fire elements?\"\n\n\"Resolve? Resolve my ass,\" Hei Ye snapped impatiently. \"Some shallow mages think dual-element magic is very powerful, but they are wrong. Dual-element, however, restricts development. I have immersed myself in magic for over sixty years, and with my talent, I should have reached the Grand Archmage⁴ realm long ago. But precisely because of my dual elements, I have always remained at the peak of the Archmage level, unable to break through. Do you know why? Because there are also minor restrictions between Earth and Fire. It's this tiny restriction that prevents me from ascending to the peak of the magic world. Although, under the effect of dual-element magic, I can reach the level of an ordinary Grand Archmage, I will never be able to cast spells of the eleventh tier or higher. I simply cannot withstand a forbidden spell of the eleventh tier that a Grand Archmage can cast. This is the sorrow of dual elements.\" As he spoke, his emotions were clearly agitated.\n\nNian Bing looked at Hei Ye in disappointment. \"Then, in that case, it's even more impossible for my Ice and Fire of the Same Origin to resolve the restrictions. They are mutually exclusive. The more I continue to cultivate, the stronger my magical power, the more dangerous it becomes?\"\n\nHei Ye lowered his head, pondering for a long while before saying, \"Nian Bing, tell me honestly, what level has your magical strength reached now?\"\n\nNian Bing answered truthfully, \"My magical power has reached the Grand Mage⁵ level, and my magic control might be slightly stronger than a Grand Mage's.\"\n\nThe surprise in Hei Ye's eyes intensified greatly. \"Grand Mage? I truly doubt how you've survived. So, you must have some special method of control for both Ice and Fire magic. How did you do it?\"\n\nNian Bing revealed his cultivation process without any concealment. He could see that Archmage Hei Ye before him was a more dedicated mage than his own teacher, Long Zhi. Hei Ye's insights into magic would definitely help him. As a fellow dual-element mage, Hei Ye would surely understand his difficulties better than Long Zhi. Even if he could only provide a single clue, Nian Bing might just be able to complete his Ice and Fire of the Same Origin.\n\nListening to Nian Bing's narration, Hei Ye's eyes flashed repeatedly. \"Rotation, it's actually rotation! Relying on the centrifugal force of rotation to make two extreme magics, though intertwined, not interfere with each other. Coupled with your innate constitution's adaptability to both Ice and Fire elemental magic, this allowed you to possess the pseudo Ice and Fire of the Same Origin ability. Just as you imagine, the moment the rotation stops, your body absolutely cannot withstand the mutual conflict of the two, resulting in certain death. I never expected that reckless Zi Qingjian to send me a treasure. Don't bother with culinary arts anymore. From today on, oh, no, from now on, we will study the mysteries of dual-element magic together. As long as I can find a way to help you solve the Ice and Fire of the Same Origin, I myself will surely reach the Grand Archmage realm. Listening to your cultivation method today greatly enlightened me.\"\n\nDespite their first meeting, Hei Ye acted as if he had met an old friend, directly pulling Nian Bing towards his magic laboratory.\n\nThree months passed. Zi Qingmeng had frequently felt irritable during this period, especially when she recalled that handsome face. Originally, she had been waiting for Nian Bing to challenge her. She simply didn't believe her Green Curtain Dignity could be inferior to Nian Bing's Brocade Letter Empty Window⁶. Although seeing Nian Bing's \"Red Silk\"⁷ left in the Culinary Arts Department had been a great blow to her, she still felt she had a chance to win. However, three months went by, and let alone a challenge, she hadn't even seen a glimpse of Nian Bing. For three months, Nian Bing hadn't left the eighth floor of the main academic building, much less performed what his \"sour culinary arts teacher\" should do. As for Archmage Hei Ye, he hadn't taught a single class since that day, leaving all courses to his subordinate teachers. According to the Magic Department teachers, Archmage Hei Ye was conducting some magic research with Nian Bing. How could a low-level mage be so highly regarded by Archmage Hei Ye? If one were to ask who was the most arrogant in the academy, it would undoubtedly be Archmage Hei Ye. She really couldn't understand what magical charm Nian Bing possessed.\n\nThinking of this, a strange anger welled up in her heart. She forcefully slapped the counter in front of her, startling the people around her. \"You two mind the shop, I'm going back to the academy!\" With that, she turned and walked towards the backyard in a huff. She had always been Lanmeng Academy's heaven's favored daughter⁸, recognized greatly by her teachers for her extraordinary talent in both martial arts and culinary arts, even becoming a teacher in the Culinary Arts Department. But Nian Bing's appearance had shaken her confidence. She knew that until she defeated Nian Bing, she couldn't truly be happy.\n\n\"Hello, excuse me, could you tell me how to get to Lanmeng Academy?\" A soft and melodious female voice sounded beside her. Zi Qingmeng subconsciously looked up and her delicate body trembled. What she saw was a stunning beauty dressed in blue clothes and trousers. Her eyes, as blue as a clear sky, her long pink hair like a waterfall, and her slender and well-proportioned figure, all left a deep impression. Everything was just right; she was simply a perfect masterpiece from heaven. Zi Qingmeng, who prided herself on her looks, actually felt a sense of inferiority upon seeing her.\n\n\"Miss, I know how to get to Lanmeng Academy. How about I show you for free?\" A lewd voice spoke from nearby. It was Li San'er, who had previously taken a silver coin from Nian Bing. His eyes were completely drawn to the blue-clad beauty in front of him, his Adam's apple bobbing repeatedly as if he were swallowing saliva.\n\nThe blue-clad woman glanced at the seemingly dazed Zi Qingmeng and said to Li San, \"Then I'll trouble you, please lead the way.\"\n\nLi San excitedly rubbed his hands, about to lead the blue-clad beauty away, when Zi Qingmeng's cold voice suddenly rang out. \"Li San'er, you don't want to make a living in Lanmeng City anymore, do you? Get lost. Young lady, I'll take you.\" Only then did Li San notice Zi Qingmeng's presence. He wanted to argue, but the moment he met Zi Qingmeng's cold gaze, his temper instantly vanished. He greedily glanced at the blue-clad girl's beauty, then slunk away.\n\nZi Qingmeng came beside the blue-clad beauty, looking at the longsword with a red scabbard in her hand. \"Young lady, you're coming to Lanmeng Academy to study martial arts, aren't you? I'm also a student of the Martial Arts Department.\"\n\nThe blue-clad beauty was momentarily surprised, then smiled. \"You could say that. Then I'll trouble you to lead the way.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng nodded and said nothing more, leading the way towards Lanmeng Academy. The blue-clad beauty's allure was simply too great. Wherever she went, the head-turn rate was absolutely one hundred percent. Zi Qingmeng, walking beside her, could only serve as a foil. The blue-clad beauty always had a faint smile on her face. Everyone who looked at her clearly felt a sacred aura, unable to even entertain any thought of blasphemy in their hearts.\n\nZi Qingmeng felt extremely put out. In Lanmeng Academy, she was considered one of the top beauties. When had she ever encountered such a situation? Now she felt like she had become the blue-clad beauty's maid. She secretly thought, 'No matter what, I can't let her enter Lanmeng Academy and outshine me. Now I can only hope her martial arts aren't very high, so she fails the test.'\n\nThe two women walked into Lanmeng Academy. As they reached the center of the huge training ground, the blue-clad beauty suddenly stopped. Zi Qingmeng looked at her. \"Why aren't you moving? If you want to join our Martial Arts Department, you need to pass a test.\"\n\nThe blue-clad beauty shook her head. \"I'm not here to study. I heard Lanmeng Academy's Martial Arts Department is one of the continent's top academies, and I want to challenge your academy's teachers.\"\n\n\"Challenge?\" Zi Qingmeng confirmed she hadn't misheard. Her delicate brows furrowed slightly. \"You want to challenge our academy's teachers?\"\n\nThe blue-clad beauty nodded, planted her longsword, still in its scabbard, into the ground, and tilted her head back, letting her pink hair hang down behind her. The gentle breeze carried a faint fragrance. She took out a blue silk ribbon from her embrace and tied her hair, which added a touch of heroism to her appearance. \"Please, could you call out your academy's teachers?\"\n\n---\n¹ A 'mother-son linked bullet' (子母連環彈) refers to a main projectile that releases smaller projectiles, often used in conjunction with a feint (聲東擊西 - feinting to the east, attacking to the west) to distract and then attack from an unexpected direction.\n² In this context, 魔導士 (Mao Dao Shi) denotes a high-ranking mage.\n³ The original text uses 懺悔 (chànhuǐ, meaning 'repent'), which is likely a typo.

    "content": "Zi Qingmeng's expression darkened. For years, there had been no shortage of people who prided themselves on their excellence in all aspects coming to challenge, but their only outcome was to return defeated. Now, this beauty, who completely surpassed her in appearance, had actually come to challenge her. \"If you want to challenge a teacher of the Martial Arts Academy, then you must first pass through me.\" Sweeping her hand into her clothes, she took out a short blade only about a foot long. Her figure suddenly floated back, watching the blue-clothed beauty from three zhang* away. The short blade came out of its sheath, bringing with it a hazy blue glow, and under the pressure of her battle aura, it emitted a layer of dazzling blade aura.\n\nThe blue-clothed beauty smiled slightly and said, \"Do you accept my challenge? Your battle aura isn't weak, but you are not my opponent. Call your teachers. You brought me here; I owe you a favor and don't want to fight you.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng said coldly, \"You owe me nothing. Since you're here to challenge, pass through me first.\" Her short blade lightly swung, bringing a hazy sheen to its hazy blue body. Cold qi radiated from the blade, and her body was already covered by a layer of green battle aura, displaying the strength of a Swordsman-level master.\n\nThe confrontation between the two beauties immediately drew the attention of the surrounding students. In an instant, hundreds of Lan Meng Academy students surrounded them, watching the two beauties. Some quick-witted students had already gone to the teaching building to report to the Martial Arts Department teachers.\n\nThe blue-clothed beauty pulled out the sword stuck in the ground, smiled indifferently, and said, \"In that case, make your move. If you lose, your teachers will naturally come out.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng snorted coldly, sliding forward one zhang. The short blade in her hand seemed alive, gently waving in her grip. Like a green sphere of light, her vital energy firmly locked onto her opponent. Her feet shuffled in small, irregular steps, without any discernible pattern. Her graceful figure moved like a dance, seemingly approaching the blue-clothed beauty from all directions.\n\nThe blue-clothed beauty stood there, still smiling, not even unsheathing her longsword, quietly waiting. All the green figures suddenly converged. The misty green light instantly exploded, and the green sphere of light transformed into countless blade shadows, enveloping her body.\n\nThe blue-clothed beauty didn't move her feet. With a slight flick of her wrist, a dark red light carrying a scorching airflow lifted her sheathed longsword. Her battle aura did not spread outside her body like Zi Qingmeng's but was completely condensed onto the scabbard, without any embellishment. The scabbard pointed forward in a stabbing posture, heading directly for the center of Zi Qingmeng's blade shadows.\n\n\"Condense—\" Zi Qingmeng let out a delicate shout. A strange scene appeared: the originally chaotic green blade shadows suddenly converged in the middle, the illusions vanished, and dozens of blades merged into one. With a soft clang, the short blade accurately struck the front end of the scabbard. The green light completely retracted at this moment. One could see that the short blade in Zi Qingmeng's hand was entirely forged from green metal. The hilt, about five inches long, was held in her hand, the blade eight inches long, its tip slightly upturned. Under the sunlight, it shimmered with a faint cold gleam.\n\nThe pause lasted only a moment. Zi Qingmeng groaned, retreating five steps consecutively before stabilizing herself. At this moment, the blue-clothed beauty had resumed her posture of resting on her sword, as if she had never moved. \"Good blade technique. You cleverly utilized the blade's acceleration to gather power into a single point instantly, compensating for the inadequacy of your own battle aura. Unfortunately, you possess an excellent blade technique, but your battle aura has only recently entered the Swordsman realm. You cannot fully unleash the power of your blade technique. As I said, you are not my opponent. Call your teachers out.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng's face at this moment was like the short blade in her hand. Her blood and qi churned within her, and a scorching aura continuously emanated from her blade. She dared not speak, fearing that if her battle aura slackened, the opponent's fire-attribute battle aura would invade her body.\n\n\"What's with all these people gathered around? Huh, Xiaomeng, what's wrong with you?\" As Zi Qingjian's tall figure appeared, the students immediately cleared a path for him. He strode to Zi Qingmeng's side. When he saw the blue-clothed beauty, Zi Qingjian froze. He clearly perceived his heart rate accelerating. He was twenty-seven this year, and for the first time in twenty-seven years, his heart beat faster because of a woman. He couldn't believe that the woman before him was considerably more beautiful than his own sister in appearance. Standing there, she naturally exuded an imposing aura like a towering mountain, and that unshakable feeling left a profound impression on him. The smile on her face was so gentle, and her azure eyes were so clear.\n\n\"Brother.\" Zi Qingmeng's voice was a little hoarse. Her call brought Zi Qingjian back to his senses, and only then did he realize something was wrong with his sister. He placed a palm on his sister's shoulder, channeling his same-origin battle aura into her body. Only then did Zi Qingmeng's complexion improve, and the short blade in her hand regained its luster. \"Little sister, what happened?\" Zi Qingjian asked curiously.\n\nA hint of hatred flashed in Zi Qingmeng's eyes. \"Brother, she's here to challenge. You make your move; you must defeat her.\"\n\nZi Qingjian looked at the blue-clothed beauty in astonishment. \"You're here to challenge? Did you hurt my sister?\"\n\nThe blue-clothed beauty smiled slightly and said, \"No, I didn't hurt her. I merely suppressed the battle aura within her. If your strength is only similar to hers, then please call out your teachers.\"\n\nListening to the blue-clothed beauty's captivating voice, Zi Qingjian felt a flush on his face. \"I, I am a teacher of the academy.\" His voice was not as loud as usual.\n\nThe blue-clothed beauty's eyes lit up. She raised the longsword in her hand and said, \"Then please make your move. With weapons or bare-handed, the choice is yours.\"\n\nZi Qingjian coughed, stabilizing his mind. \"Weapons have no eyes; let's go bare-handed. My hands are quite heavy; you'll need to be careful.\"\n\nThe blue-clothed beauty smiled indifferently and said, \"Is that so? Then I'd like to see it for myself.\" With a flick of her wrist, the sheathed longsword silently plunged into the ground, nearly half-buried in the earth. Taking a step forward, her gaze changed. The gentle smile vanished, replaced by tranquility. Her feet formed a T-shaped stance, and her palms stood like blades, one in front and one behind, guarding her chest.\n\nZi Qingjian had been a martial arts fanatic since childhood. Feeling the opponent's mountain-like stability, there was no longer any beauty in his eyes. His right foot instantly stepped forward. His entire skeleton cracked, and violent green battle aura scattered, flying outwards. Around his body, a swirling wall seemed to appear. For wind-attribute battle aura, known for its agility and speed, to be cultivated to such a violent realm, he was truly a prodigy.\n\nFrom the main teaching building, an old man and a young man walked out through the main door. Hei Ye stretched lazily. \"I'm old, truly old. It's only been three months, and my body can barely hold up.\" This old and young pair emerging from the teaching building were Nian Bing and Hei Ye, who had been diligently studying magic. Both their faces appeared somewhat pale, seemingly from prolonged absence from sunlight.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Teacher, please don't say that. With your mental power, how could you feel tired?\" Over the past three months, his gains had been enormous. Having realized the importance of fundamentals, he hadn't been studying magic arrays. While jointly researching dual-element magic with Hei Ye, whenever he had free time, he would wholeheartedly immerse himself in meditation, spending at least fifteen to sixteen hours a day meditating. Over the past three months, he had learned many things from Hei Ye, especially regarding the combined application of dual-element magic. Hei Ye's magical knowledge was extremely profound; even Long Zhi couldn't compare. Breathing in the fresh air that wafted from the sports field, he clearly felt that he had grown stronger.\n\nHei Ye let out a soft exclamation. \"What's going on over there? Why are so many people gathered? The atmosphere feels off! Little Nian Bing, let's go take a look.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Teacher, aren't you the one who dislikes bustling crowds the most? Yesterday, I remember you saying that solitude is the purest state. Only in a state of quiet inaction can magic be better improved.\"\n\nHei Ye glared at Nian Bing. \"You brat, you can be flexible about anything. Staying alone all the time, it would be strange if you didn't develop an eccentric personality.\" His words seemed reproachful, but the doting affection within them was extremely obvious. Over the past three months, Nian Bing's magical strength had significantly improved. Similarly, Hei Ye, thanks to Nian Bing's various novel ideas, had gained a deeper understanding of dual-element magic. He vaguely felt that the problem he had been unable to solve had found a breakthrough. What he needed now was a moment of enlightenment; he was just a hair's breadth away from breaking through to the Archmage realm. A dual-element mage was truly one in ten thousand. Nian Bing's talent and intelligence greatly impressed Hei Ye; he had already come to regard Nian Bing as his direct disciple.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Master, you've worked hard these past few days. Your disciple has nothing good to repay you with, but later, over at the Culinary Arts Department, I'll cook you a delicious meal.\"\n\nHei Ye's eyes lit up. He chuckled, \"I almost forgot, you brat are still a student of the Culinary Arts Department. No matter, haven't I only been delayed for three months? I'll go have a word with that old pervert Zi Xiu.\" A yellow light glowed from Hei Ye's body. He lightly stroked the ground with both hands. Earth elements quickly condensed, and the sports field ground suddenly rose, lifting him and Nian Bing upwards until it stopped one zhang high.\n\n\"Teacher, even though you're an Archmage, to be able to instantly cast even this third-tier magic is truly impressive!\" Nian Bing half-sincerely flattered Hei Ye. When his gaze fell upon the area surrounded by students, his entire body couldn't help but tremble fiercely. \"How is it her?\"\n\nFrom his elevated position, Hei Ye also saw the scene in the center of the sports field. \"What a beautiful young girl! Do you know her?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Yes, she's my friend.\" The blue-clothed beauty was none other than Feng Nü, whom he had not seen for several months. How did she get here? Was she looking for him, like Xue Jing? Impossible! Feng Nü couldn't possibly know his whereabouts. Carrying a confused heart, he continued to watch. Just then, Feng Nü and Zi Qingjian made their move.\n\nZi Qingjian took half a step forward with his left foot, his right hand drawing a half-arc in front of his chest, slowly moving towards Feng Nü. His green battle aura condensed without dispersing. With a low grunt, his battle aura actually solidified into a green sphere of light, suddenly blasting towards Feng Nü. Seeing this scene, Nian Bing's heart couldn't help but tighten. But the distance was simply too great; there was no way he could rush to save Feng Nü in time.\n\nFeng Nü suddenly struck a strange pose: her right palm lifted, four fingers naturally hanging down, her palm and forearm forming a ninety-degree angle. In an instant, her right hand turned completely fiery red. Seeing the green battle aura sphere arrive before her, she surprisingly neither dodged nor avoided it, striking down with a palm. The moment the red light on her hand collided with the green battle aura sphere, a deafeningly loud roar erupted. The fire-attribute battle aura and wind-attribute battle aura generated a massive shockwave upon impact, spreading outwards in arc-like ripples. Immediately, a swath of surrounding students fell. Fortunately, they were only affected by the aftermath and suffered only minor injuries. Only then did the curious students sense danger and retreated, greatly expanding the space around Feng Nü and Zi Qingjian.\n\nHei Ye saw this scene and said with some surprise, \"Zi Qingjian's battle aura has progressed so quickly! But that girl's battle aura seems a bit strange; even when contained and unreleased, it can dissolve Zi Qingjian's battle aura cannon.\"\n\nThe tremor produced by the battle aura vanished. Feng Nü stood unmoving, still maintaining her previous posture. Meanwhile, Zi Qingjian's expression subtly changed. He stood a meter away from where he had launched his attack, two deep imprints left on the ground. Evidently, he couldn't completely neutralize the aftershocks and had been pushed back from his original position.\n\nFeng Nü smiled slightly and said, \"Not bad. Your battle aura is very profound, but it's still lacking. If you don't have more formidable abilities, go call another teacher, or perhaps your dean.\"\n\nZi Qingjian's expression grew solemn. He knew he represented the academy's dignity and absolutely could not easily lose. \"Take another one of my moves.\" Enveloped in green battle aura, Zi Qingjian soared into the air. His battle aura reached its peak in an instant, his hands spread wide into claw shapes. He rose a full five zhang, pouncing towards Feng Nü like a hungry eagle snatching its prey. He roared, \"Take my Life-Rending, Flesh-Tearing Heavy—Eagle—Hand—.\" To win, he finally brought out his ultimate technique.\n\nFeng Nü's expression grew a little more serious. Her feet touching the ground, she rushed towards Zi Qingjian. Her hands subtly pulsed like wings, and red battle aura completely dyed her delicate body red. Her hands strangely lifted upwards, directly countering Zi Qingjian's Heavy Eagle Hand.\n\nNian Bing could no longer bear it. He tore open a Blizzard Scroll and rushed towards the two figures in the air. He had heard Cha Cha Ji say that the Heavy Eagle Hand could be used with varying degrees of force; when used heavily, it could easily tear apart an elephant's body. At this very moment, he suddenly realized that Feng Nü's place in his heart was so important that he would save her, even if it meant abandoning all caution.\n\nDid Feng Nü really need his saving? Although Nian Bing's movements were already very fast, there was no way he could arrive in time. Her strange red hand made a light, feathery imprint upon the Heavy Eagle Hand, which was filled with wild, overbearing power. A clear phoenix cry emanated from Feng Nü's mouth. The two separated as soon as they met, their hands colliding hundreds of times in the air in an instant. Feng Nü returned to the ground at the same speed, while Zi Qingjian was sent flying by the shock.\n\n---\n*Translator's note: One zhang is an ancient Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or 11 feet.*",

    "content": "Nian Bing had just arrived at this moment, subconsciously catching Zi Qingjian in mid-air. Using the Blizzard, he carried him towards the ground. He clearly felt Zi Qingjian's breathing was unusually rapid, and his large-knuckled, seemingly powerful hands were actually trembling slightly. He couldn't help but wonder, \"Could it be that Feng Nu won?\"\n\nLanding gracefully, Feng Nu also noticed Nian Bing, looking at him in surprise. \"Why are you here too?\" The moment these words were spoken, Nian Bing immediately confirmed that Feng Nu was not here looking for him.\n\nZi Qingjian landed on the ground, looking earnestly at Feng Nu. \"I lost. Thank you for showing mercy, young lady.\" Earlier, when the two had exchanged blows in mid-air, Feng Nu's Dou Qi had completely suppressed him. There were at least three opportunities for her to slit his throat. Others might not have seen clearly, but how could he himself not know?\n\nFeng Nu smiled slightly and said, \"Your Heavy Eagle Hand has great power, making up for the deficiency in your Dou Qi. It's a pity your Dou Qi is quite different from mine; otherwise, I really wouldn't be confident in defeating you. Lanmeng Academy is indeed a place of hidden dragons and crouching tigers.\"¹\n\nNian Bing stood between the two. \"Feng Nu, why did you start fighting with Brother Qingjian?\"\n\n\"She's here for a challenge.\" Zi Qingmeng's icy voice rang out. Discovering that Nian Bing and Feng Nu actually knew each other, an inexplicable surge of irritation rose in her heart.\n\n\"A challenge? Feng Nu, you...\" Nian Bing looked at her with an experienced gaze.\n\nFeng Nu smiled slightly and said, \"Can't I come for a challenge? If you want to improve your martial arts more effectively, actual combat is the best method. That's why I'm here. Nian Bing, what about you?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"I'm here to learn cooking and magic. You've already exchanged blows with Brother Qingjian, so why don't you stop challenging? There's no need to spoil the harmony.\"\n\nA glint flashed in Feng Nu's eyes. \"Nian Bing, I hope you won't interfere with my matters. Until I am defeated, I will continue to challenge.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned. He felt Feng Nu's resolve. At this moment, he truly didn't know which side he should stand on. Zi Qingmeng, from the side, said sarcastically, \"Aren't you a Magician? You're also a member of the academy, obligated to help the academy welcome outside challengers. If you've got the ability, defeat her.\"\n\nFeng Nu looked at Nian Bing with great interest and smiled, \"Will you fight me?\"\n\nNian Bing froze for a moment, a glint flashing in his eyes. He said, \"Alright, then I'll accept your challenge on behalf of the academy. Although I'm not a Warrior, I still have this obligation.\"\n\nFeng Nu said in surprise, \"You really want to fight me?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Why not? I didn't expect your martial arts to be so powerful, even Brother Qingjian lost. Still, I'd like to try.\"\n\nFeng Nu also smiled. She had understood Nian Bing's intention. She gently shook her head. \"Oh, you! I won't hold back, you know.\"\n\nNian Bing turned to Zi Qingjian and his sister. \"Please step back. I'll accept her challenge on behalf of the academy.\"\n\nZi Qingjian said, \"But aren't you her friend?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Friends can also spar. Please move back.\" Turning to face Feng Nu, his right hand shimmered twice, and the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Flame God appeared in his hands.\n\nFeng Nu picked up the Divine Sword of Separation from Heaven from the ground, pointing it at Nian Bing while still sheathed. \"Make your move.\"\n\nNian Bing's gaze sharpened, and intense concentration shone in his eyes. \"Feng Nu, you are the first opponent against whom I will fully use Ice-Fire Homology. Be careful. My attacks are all-pervasive.\"\n\nFeng Nu smiled, \"A Warrior's speed is a Magician's greatest threat. Let's see how you deal with my attacks. Be careful.\" As her voice fell, her body floated up as if flying. In a flash, she was already in front of Nian Bing, her sheathed sword pointing directly at his shoulder.\n\nNian Bing didn't move. Just as the sheathed sword was about to strike his body, the Morning Dew Blade in his hand suddenly swept upwards. Was he going to use his blade to block the Divine Sword of Separation from Heaven? Of course not. Even Zi Qingjian's Heavy Eagle Hand couldn't handle Feng Nu's Dou Qi, so how could he possibly block Feng Nu's sword? An azure glow emanated from the Morning Dew Blade, which was swung at an extremely fast speed directly towards Feng Nu's wrist. He actually completely disregarded the sheathed sword attacking his own body.\n\nFeng Nu's Dou Qi, even a hundred Nian Bings couldn't break it. But the Morning Dew Blade could. The Morning Dew Blade, known as the Sigh of the Ice Goddess, was precisely the bane of Feng Nu's Dou Qi, specialized in countering her fire-attribute Dou Qi. Feng Nu truly didn't dare let his blade strike her. However, the Divine Sword of Separation from Heaven was long, and she was absolutely confident she could strike Nian Bing first before dodging his blade. So, she kept her Dou Qi contained without releasing it, and continued her strike. Just then, Nian Bing smiled. Surging ice elements suddenly burst forth just as the sheathed sword was about to hit his body, forming an Ice Wall between him and Feng Nu. Meanwhile, the Morning Dew Blade in his hand, without any flourish, sliced forward, instantly shifting into dozens of positions, cutting towards Feng Nu's arm with chilling blade qi.\n\nAt this point, if Feng Nu were to release her Dou Qi externally, the fourth-tier Ice Wall Spell would absolutely not be able to withstand it. However, Nian Bing's Morning Dew Blade would also slice her arm, so she simply had no time to release her Dou Qi. Left with no choice, she had to turn to save herself, flipping the Divine Sword of Separation from Heaven in her hand to block Nian Bing's Morning Dew Blade.\n\nNian Bing had no Dou Qi. If he were to clash head-on, not only would the Morning Dew Blade be flung away, but he himself would likely be thrown back immediately. However, although he lacked Dou Qi, when it came to the speed of drawing and striking with the blade, even Feng Nu couldn't compare. A fast strike meant a fast retraction. As Feng Nu turned to save herself, his blade had already been withdrawn. The Ice Wall Spell instantly expanded, blocking Feng Nu's path, while he himself quickly retreated a few steps, chanting the most needed spell in a steady voice: \"Oh, great Ice Goddess! Please lend me your wrath, and send us to the lost shore—Blizzard.\"\n\nUnder the Sigh of the Ice Goddess's aid, the Blizzard swiftly appeared before Nian Bing. However, no matter how fast magic formed, it couldn't be faster than a Warrior's movements. The Ice Wall Spell had completely shattered when the Blizzard was only halfway formed. Nian Bing did not panic. The Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Flame God simultaneously pointed forward, and a Fireball and an Ice Ball flew out at the same time, blocking Feng Nu's path.\n\nFeng Nu lightly waved her sheathed sword, and two points of red light floated out gracefully, meeting the spells attacking her. Her forward speed did not decrease in the slightest. Just then, the two advancing first-tier spells suddenly stagnated, then instantly flew sideways, colliding with each other. The moment they collided was also precisely when Feng Nu charged in.\n\nAmidst a violent roar, Feng Nu's forward momentum came to an abrupt halt. Red Dou Qi suddenly burst forth, completely blocking the power of the explosion. However, the two extreme spells, ice and fire, still caused her considerable trouble due to her carelessness, making her lose the opportunity to pursue Nian Bing. From afar, the Dark Night Magister exclaimed in admiration, \"Good, what a magnificent Ice-Fire Homology!\"\n\nThe Blizzard carried Nian Bing's body upwards. Once a Magician takes flight, the situation is not as favorable for a Warrior. Of course, without the strength of a Grand Magician or higher, it's not easy to fly, especially for Fire-elemental and Earth-elemental Magicians, who simply cannot fly at all.\n\nFloating in mid-air, Nian Bing looked at Feng Nu, who had stopped. He smiled, \"Do you want to continue? How about we call it a draw?\"\n\nFeng Nu snapped, \"You wish! Do you think you can win against me like this? If I remember correctly, a Blizzard can't fly too high, and it can't sustain itself for too long, can it?\"\n\nHearing her say this, Nian Bing smiled, \"In that case, please receive my moves.\" First-tier Fireballs and Ice Balls, with the two peerless divine blades acting as magic staves, rained down overwhelmingly.\n\nFeng Nu hmphed. The Divine Sword of Separation from Heaven finally unsheathed. Its fiery red glow instantly flared up, and driven by her Dou Qi, it actually produced a ten-foot-long red radiance. Wherever the fiery light passed, whether it was a spell from Ice-Fire Homology that exploded or one that hadn't had time to explode, none could escape that fiery red light curtain. No matter how powerful Ice-Fire Homology was, it was impossible to defeat a powerful Martial Artist like Feng Nu with just first-tier spells.\n\nWatching that formidable sword light, Zi Qingjian and his sister couldn't help but gasp. Such furious Dou Qi, combined with that red-glowing longsword, was absolutely beyond what they could withstand. This was Feng Nu's true strength! Zi Qingmeng quietly asked her elder brother, \"Is she a Martial Fighter?\"\n\nZi Qingjian nodded. \"Not only is she a Martial Fighter, but she's a Martial Fighter approaching the Martial Saint realm. I really don't know how she cultivated at such a young age.\"\n\nNian Bing, still in the air, looked at Feng Nu with a wry smile. His attacks had stopped. Should he use powerful magic? Nian Bing didn't want to; what if he injured Feng Nu? But he was already riding a tiger, hard to dismount.² Feng Nu clearly didn't want to back down. What should he do now?\n\nJust as Nian Bing was hesitating whether to continue the match, an aged voice rang out. \"Nian Bing, come down. I believe this young lady came to Lanmeng to find me.\"\n\nAt this moment, thousands of students had gathered on the school field, but this aged voice still clearly reached everyone's ears. Looking down from his elevated position, Nian Bing saw the crowd part like a tide, making way for a tall, somewhat hunched old man who slowly walked into the circle. Nian Bing recognized this old man; he was precisely the sweeping old man who, three months ago, had enlightened him about the importance of fundamentals!\n\n\"Dean, Dean...\" Respectful voices kept sounding. The old man smiled and gestured to the surrounding students. When he reached the center of the circle, Zi Qingjian and his sister both lowered their heads. \"Father.\"\n\nNian Bing nearly fell from the air. He never would have thought that the sweeping old man from back then was actually the father of Zi Qingjian and his sister, as well as the Head of the entire Martial Arts Department and the Dean of Lanmeng Academy.\n\nThe old man faced Feng Nu, who was holding the Divine Sword of Separation from Heaven, and smiled, \"Young lady, I was right, wasn't I? Your elders must have sent you to find a person named Zi Meng. I am Zi Meng.\"\n\nFeng Nu, with a backhand motion, put the Divine Sword of Separation from Heaven behind her back, and nodded to Zi Meng. \"Hello, Dean. My purpose in coming here is to spar with you.\"\n\nZi Meng smiled slightly and said, \"Why won't your elders let go of my old bones! Since that's the case, please begin.\"\n\nFeng Nu glanced at Nian Bing, who had already landed. Her expression suddenly became solemn. Red Dou Qi continuously surged, rendering her body like a ball of flame. Just then, the ground suddenly trembled. Surrounding the positions where Feng Nu and Zi Meng stood, the ground with a diameter of one hundred meters suddenly bulged upwards, and the students on the periphery could only watch as the ground lifted from the earth, stopping only after rising ten feet. Zi Meng glanced towards the teaching building. \"Thank you, old pal.\" To be able to apply Earth-elemental magic to such a sublime degree, it could only be Hei Ye, Nian Bing's newly acknowledged teacher.\n\nHei Ye's voice came from afar, \"Old Zi, don't embarrass yourself!\" Unbeknownst to them, Zi Xiu had already arrived beside him, gazing from afar towards their direction.\n\nZi Meng said nothing, making a \"please\" gesture towards Feng Nu. Feng Nu's expression showed no fluctuation due to the change in the ground. The Nine-Separations Dou Qi on her body burned even more intensely. The Divine Sword of Separation from Heaven slowly lifted. Suddenly, she moved. The longsword in her hand instantly swung forward, cutting out a surging red light blade that went straight for Zi Meng. Her body followed the sword as she charged towards Zi Meng. The instant she left her original position, the red Dou Qi around her body suddenly changed, turning into a faint silver. Dragging her sword forward, due to her excessive speed, she left a trail of silver afterimages in the air.\n\nNian Bing didn't understand martial arts well, but he heard Zi Qingjian gasp in a low voice, \"It's really Saint Qi of the Martial Saint realm! Although it's barely achieved, she has already stepped one foot into the gate of Martial Saints!\"\n\nA similar silver light emanated from Zi Meng. The silver light on him was much denser than Feng Nu's, very naturally blocking Feng Nu's attack. No roar appeared. The silver light suddenly flared greatly under Feng Nu's lightning-fast movements, making it difficult to discern their fight from the outside.\n\nNian Bing quietly asked Zi Qingjian, \"Brother Qingjian, what is Saint Qi?\"\n\nZi Qingjian explained, \"Saint Qi can be said to be the highest realm pursued by Warriors. Regardless of what attribute of Dou Qi one cultivates, once the Saint Qi realm is reached, its color will turn silver. This is the symbol of a Martial Saint! Besides the legendary golden Divine Qi of God-tier Masters, Saint Qi is the strongest. My father reached the Martial Saint realm fifteen years ago at the age of forty-seven, earning him the title of the youngest Martial Saint. From then on, Lanmeng Academy became renowned throughout the continent, and he, along with six other Martial Saints, was collectively revered by the continent's martial arts world as the Seven Saints. Yet, this young lady looks to be only around 20 years old, and she has already entered the Martial Saint realm. It's truly hard to believe.\"\n\n---\n¹ \"hidden dragons and crouching tigers\" (藏龙卧虎 cánglóngwòhǔ): An idiom describing a place or group containing many hidden talents or powerful individuals.\n² \"riding a tiger, hard to dismount\" (骑虎难下 qíhǔnánxià): An idiom describing a situation where one is committed to a course of action and cannot back out, even if it becomes dangerous or difficult.",

    "title": "Chapter 52 The Woman Close to Martial Saint (Part 1)",
    "content": "Martial Saint? Martial Saints and Arch-Mages are equivalent realms. Nian Bing was also dumbfounded upon hearing Zi Qingjian's words. He himself hadn't even entered the realm of a mage, yet Feng Nü was already approaching a Martial Saint, equivalent to an Arch-Mage, with Saint Dou Qi. It was truly laughable! He had just thought of offering her a graceful exit so she wouldn't continue challenging. This only showed he overestimated his own abilities. With her dou qi cultivation, even with his Blizzard spell, he wouldn't be able to evade her attacks! His mind was in a whirl, while the two on the earth platform were already fighting with gusto. When Nian Bing looked up again, he found that the two figures on the earth platform had vanished. Just as he was about to ask, he heard two sharp sounds, seemingly produced by dou qi slicing through the air.\n\nTwo figures gracefully landed on opposite sides of the earth platform. Zi Meng was as composed as ever, but Feng Nü's face appeared somewhat pale. Her dou qi had returned to the color of flames, and her clothes and pink hair looked a little dishevelled. Her ample chest rose and fell continuously, her eyes flashing as she looked at Zi Meng. Silence. The entire training ground became exceptionally quiet.\n\n\"I lost,\" Feng Nü's voice was very calm.\n\nZi Meng smiled faintly and said, \"Although I had the upper hand, the victor wasn't truly decided. You had a chance for both of us to be defeated.\"\n\nFeng Nü shook her head and said, \"No, I barely forced a draw by relying on the Heaven-Departing Divine Sword. If you had a weapon in hand, I would have lost long ago, let alone having a chance to perish together. I will return.\"\n\nZi Meng smiled gently and said, \"You don't need to come again. In ten years, your martial arts will surely surpass mine. Those seniors of yours have finally succeeded in cultivating the Innate Nine-Separations Body. However, your weakness lies in your inability to balance the impetuousness in your dou qi. If you can achieve a state of being unmoved by honor or disgrace and perfectly fluid, even if I had a weapon in hand, it wouldn't be easy to defeat you. When you go back, you can tell them that I lost the wager back then. If they have a chance, tell them to come find me for a drink. I'll have Zi Xiu personally cook for us. It's been many years. I wonder how their health is?\"\n\nFeng Nü's eyes showed respect, \"The elders are well. Thank you for your guidance, Senior. Fighting with you, Senior, Feng Nü has benefited greatly.\"\n\nZi Meng smiled, \"If you're willing, you can stay and cultivate in the academy for a while. Perhaps I can teach you a few things.\"\n\nFeng Nü's eyes flashed repeatedly, and she shook her head, saying, \"Thank you for your kindness, but I have other matters and must leave as soon as possible.\"\n\nZi Meng said, \"Very well. Remember to convey my words to your seniors.\"\n\nFeng Nü nodded. Just as she was about to jump off the earth platform, a figure flashed. The magical aura on the earth platform suddenly grew dense, and Nian Bing had already floated up. \"Feng Nü, can you wait a moment before leaving?\"\n\nFeng Nü was stunned. \"Nian Bing, you...\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"It's been months since we last met. I want to cook a meal for you. A meal won't delay you too much, will it?\"\n\nFeng Nü also smiled. \"Alright! It's been many days since I've had a delicious meal.\" Seeing Nian Bing again, she was equally delighted. This time, however, she had fully demonstrated her strength in front of Nian Bing. She had originally feared Nian Bing might hold a grudge. But now it seemed he had no dissatisfaction.\n\nNian Bing turned his gaze to Zi Meng and respectfully said, \"Dean, thank you for your guidance that day. I benefited greatly from it. Today, I have something I'd like to trouble you with.\"\n\nZi Meng smiled faintly and said, \"Young man, for your magic to reach such a realm at such a young age, and to be an Ice-Fire Dual-Origin Mage at that, your future is limitless. Just tell me what it is.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes shone brightly, and he said in a deep voice, \"I would like to ask you to preside over a contest. I also want to issue a challenge.\"\n\n\"A challenge?\" Zi Meng was momentarily stunned. \"Who do you want to challenge?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"I want to challenge the head of the Culinary Arts Department, Senior Hunchback Chef Zi Xiu. I hope you will agree.\"\n\nZi Meng smiled, \"I heard from Zi Xiu that you are the successor to Ghost Chef. However, even if you defeat Zi Xiu, what's the point? Why don't you just exchange pointers? There's no need for such a serious challenge.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"No, this is very important to me. Because Senior Zi Xiu said that if I could defeat him, he would tell me something.\"\n\nA surprised glint appeared in Zi Meng's eyes. At that moment, Hunchback Chef Zi Xiu arrived on the earth platform with a few leaps. \"Brat, you really want to challenge me? I once said you must defeat my two disciples before you have the right to challenge me.\"\n\nNian Bing calmly said, \"Senior Zi Xiu, I don't think that's necessary. With my culinary skills, Big Brother Qingjian and Miss Qingmeng cannot possibly defeat me. I have that much confidence.\"\n\nZi Xiu chuckled and said, \"Then what is the source of your confidence?\"\n\nNian Bing looked up at him and calmly said, \"Magic.\"\n\n\"Magic?\" Zi Xiu looked at Nian Bing in surprise. Nian Bing nodded and repeated, \"Precisely, magic.\"\n\nZi Xiu fell into deep thought. After a long moment, he said, \"So, you learned magic because you want to integrate it into your culinary arts. Cha Ji, that old fellow, truly rises where he falls!\"*\n\nNian Bing said, \"Now I should have the qualifications to challenge you, shouldn't I? Using magic in cooking is my greatest advantage. Perhaps my mastery of cooking techniques is far inferior to yours, but I have ample confidence in myself.\"\n\nHunchback Chef Zi Xiu turned to Zi Meng and said, \"Big Brother, approve his challenge. I'd like to see how much of Cha Ji's skill he has learned. Nian Bing, I'll be waiting for you at the Academy Restaurant.\" As soon as he finished speaking, he floated up, instantly accelerating enveloped in cyan dou qi, sweeping over the students' heads. After several pushes off the ground for leverage, he disappeared. Although he didn't possess the Martial Saint strength of his elder brother Zi Meng, his martial arts had also reached the realm of a Martial Warrior.\n\nZi Meng gazed at Nian Bing with a deep look, then suddenly smiled. \"It's been a long time since I've seen Brother Xiu this serious. Young man, you must do your best! I also want to taste what food brought by magic will be like. Old Hei, you come along too. Miss Feng, please.\"\n\nNian Bing, Zi Meng, Feng Nü, along with Zi Qingjian and his sister, and Mage Heiye—a group of six—left the academy and arrived at the restaurant where Nian Bing had first been led by Li San. Although the students also wanted to witness this fierce contest, the restaurant was only so big. Furthermore, Zi Meng had issued a strict order, forbidding anyone from skipping class, so they could only sigh with regret.\n\nWith a faint smile, Nian Bing's heart was calm. It was Feng Nü's challenge to Zi Meng that had stirred his competitive spirit. He knew very well that although Feng Nü came here to challenge Zi Meng, she must have known she was not a match for Zi Meng, who was a Martial Saint. Yet, she did not flinch, unleashing her full strength to challenge Zi Meng. As for his own challenge to Zi Xiu, he already had a few chances of winning, so why wait? He had already wasted quite a bit of time at the academy. The time for the Rising Star Mage Competition was drawing closer. In these past three months, he had finally found some of the true integration secrets of his Ice-Fire Dual-Origin. Once he went to Olan City and completed Luo Rou's entrustment, he could find a place to quietly cultivate. A place like the academy simply wasn't suitable for him. Having grown accustomed to a free life, any restraint made him feel uncomfortable. Therefore, Nian Bing chose this moment to challenge Zi Xiu directly in front of Dean Zi Meng.\n\nWhen they arrived at the restaurant, Zi Xiu had already changed into a chef's robe. Seeing Nian Bing's arrival, he said, \"Brat. You choose the method of the contest, so you don't accuse me of taking advantage of my age.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"As they say in warfare, quality matters more than quantity.* We can apply the same principle to our culinary arts. I will compete with you on a single dish, your signature dish, and then we'll invite everyone present to judge and decide the winner. I hope you won't forget what you said earlier: if I win, you will tell me who my Master's enemy is.\"\n\nZi Xiu snorted, \"You're very confident, brat! When I made a name for myself, you didn't even know where you were.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Senior Zi Xiu, are you scared?\"\n\nZi Xiu's heart trembled. Yes, looking at this confident young man in front of him, why had his own confidence suddenly vanished? A glint flashed in his eyes, and his lost aura reappeared. \"I'll give you half an hour to choose the ingredients you need. In half an hour, we'll have a showdown. I want to see how you can fully display the techniques your Master taught you in a single dish.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Alright, this junior also wishes to experience the unique skills of Hunchback Chef God.\"\n\nFeng Nü walked over to Nian Bing and smiled, \"Do you need any help?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"No need, you just wait to eat. Since leaving Master, I haven't cooked a dish with my full effort. Today, I'll let you taste my Ice-Fire Feast. I believe I will win.\"\n\nZi Xiu said, \"Nian Bing, I won't take advantage of you. Xiao Meng, you're responsible for preparing my ingredients. Qingjian, you help Nian Bing. Whatever he needs, as long as it can be bought in the city, satisfy all his needs.\"\n\nZi Qingjian came to Nian Bing's side. \"Brother, what ingredients do you need?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, asked him for paper and pen, and carefully wrote down the things he needed, handing the list to Zi Qingjian. Zi Qingjian quickly scanned it and immediately went to procure them. Zi Meng and Zi Xiu went aside to chat, while Heiye sat with his eyes closed, unsure if he was meditating or dozing off. It was afternoon, and there were no customers in the restaurant. An ultimate culinary showdown was about to begin.\n\n\"Feng Nü, weren't you going to the Langmu Empire? Why did you come here to challenge Dean Zi Meng?\" Nian Bing asked in a low voice.\n\nFeng Nü glanced at him and said, \"My business there was finished. I'm also traveling the continent, challenging various experts to perfect my martial arts. What about you? How did you end up here?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"I originally intended to go to Olan City, but I heard that the Olan Empire was at war with the Huasheng and Qilu Empires, so I came here first. It's been a few months, and you seem even more beautiful.\"\n\nSeeing the smile on Nian Bing's face, Feng Nü's pretty face flushed slightly. \"When did you become so smooth-tongued? The war ended a month ago. The empires were simply bluffing. However, it's said that the Olan Empire suffered considerable losses this time. Dozens of cities were plundered empty. It was only when the Ice God Mage Legion and the Ace Knight Regiment of the Ice Moon Empire arrived that the war was resolved. The Olan Empire wanted revenge, but the Huasheng and Qilu Empires retreated to their own national borders and deployed heavy troops to defend. Because the border cities were plundered, the Olan Empire's resources simply couldn't keep up, and the Ice Moon Empire was on a distant expedition, so in the end, it just fizzled out. However, this war seems to foreshadow that the continent will become turbulent again.\"\n\nNian Bing said with some confusion, \"What about the Langmu Empire? Did they not participate in the war? From what I heard, the Langmu Empire has always been at odds with the Huarong Empire, and the two countries border each other. Why didn't they take advantage of such a good opportunity? If they combined the strength of those three empires, they might have been able to inflict a defeat on Huarong and Qilu.\"\n\nFeng Nü's eyes flashed repeatedly. \"It's not that easy. The Huarong Empire's strength is far greater than imagined, with countless strong experts. Although this time they attacked the Olan Empire, their Flaming Lion Knight Regiment always guarded the border with the Langmu Empire. The Langmu Empire once launched a probing attack and suffered considerable losses. Fortunately, the war has temporarily subsided now, and it shouldn't flare up again for a while. As for the future, it's hard to say. Nian Bing, are you really confident you can defeat that Hunchback Chef?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and shook his head, then said solemnly, \"How could I be confident? Hunchback Chef God gained fame over thirty years ago, ranking third among the Five Great Chef Gods at the time. My understanding of Senior Zi Xiu is limited only to what my Master told me. Twenty years have passed; who knows what new research Senior Zi Xiu has done? I can only give it my all. My advantage lies in magic. The odds of victory are fifty-fifty. However, I do have a way to greatly increase my chances of winning; it just depends on whether you'll help.\"\n\nFeng Nü was stunned, then asked, puzzled, \"Me? What can I do to help you? You know I can only cook porridge. It would be good enough if I don't cause you any trouble.\"\n\nNian Bing remained earnest. \"No, you can help me a great deal! You see, for an excellent chef, the quality of their mood determines whether they can fully unleash their culinary skills. With your help, I can wholeheartedly dedicate myself to cooking, and with a joyful mood, I will naturally be able to create even more delicious things. I just don't know if you're willing.\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled faintly and said, \"This concerns the whereabouts of your Master's enemy. As long as I can help, just say it. I will definitely help you.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing's expression changed, his originally serious and handsome face now carried a hint of a smile. He whispered, \"It's simple. If you promise to let me kiss you after I win, my mood will naturally become delighted.\"\n\nFeng Nu's pretty face flushed crimson. How could she have imagined Nian Bing would suddenly say such a thing? She made to hit him. \"You're annoying,\" she said, \"you're taking advantage of me.\"\n\nNian Bing quickly dodged to the side. \"Don't strike,\" he said, \"I can't withstand your Saint Dou Qi. I'm not joking, it's really like this! If you don't believe me, just try it and you'll know if I'm lying.\"\n\nFeng Nu snorted. \"Who wants to try?\" she said. \"You're utterly annoying. If you say it again, I'll ignore you.\"\n\nNian Bing laughed heartily. \"Alright, alright, I won't say it then,\" he said. \"Feng Nu, you look so cute when you blush.\" Seeing Feng Nu again, he always felt a certain impulse. He didn't know why, but at this moment, his heart held only Feng Nu. The tension he should have felt before competing with the Humpback Chef God didn't appear. With Feng Nu's gaze upon him, he found his confidence greatly boosted, and his whole body felt exceptionally comfortable.\n\nFeng Nu glared at him exasperatedly, the blush on her face hadn't faded. She whispered, \"Stop joking. Aren't you going to think about what dish you're going to make later? I believe you have the strength to win. Blue, derived from indigo yet surpassing indigo; ice, formed from water yet colder than water.* The older generation will always be replaced by the new. Today is a great opportunity. I believe that as long as you can win this match, you'll also gain confidence, and it will definitely take your culinary skills to the next level. Just as I spar with others in martial arts, your culinary skills also need to improve more through sparring with masters. Pressure makes people progress. Believe in yourself, you can definitely do it. Perhaps in a few years, the continent will no longer remember the Five Chef Gods, but only...\"\n\nFeng Nu's encouragement moved Nian Bing deeply. This is what a friend truly is! Encouragement at critical moments often plays a huge role. He clenched his fists, and Nian Bing nodded firmly towards Feng Nu. He stopped speaking, sat on a nearby chair, closed his eyes, and meditated like Hei Ye. Only by keeping his mental state at its optimal level could he meticulously display his full strength.\n\nHalf an hour, neither long nor short. When Nian Bing opened his eyes again, everything was ready. The hotel kitchen had been divided into two parts, and all the cooking utensils were fully equipped. Feng Nu, Zi Meng, Zi Qing Jian, Zi Qing Meng, and Hei Ye sat in a row by the wall, while Humpback Chef Zi Xiu seemed ready now, standing behind his kitchen counter, brewing something.\n\nStanding up, Nian Bing nodded slightly towards Zi Xiu. \"Senior,\" he said, \"shall we begin?\"\n\nZi Xiu nodded. \"Let's begin,\" he said. \"The limit is half an hour. Within half an hour, it should be enough for you to perform, after all, it's only one dish.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Indeed, it's enough. Senior, please.\" Having said that, he was about to walk towards his own kitchen counter. Just then, Feng Nu's voice suddenly rang out. \"Nian Bing, wait a moment.\"\n\nNian Bing looked back in surprise. Feng Nu had already stood up gracefully. Her figure flashed, and Nian Bing only felt a fragrant breeze come upon him—it was the unique body fragrance of a woman. Something cool lightly touched his face. By the time he regained his senses, everything had disappeared. Feng Nu was standing a meter in front of him, her pretty face with a blush as cute as a red apple, looking as if one would want to take a bite out of it. She whispered, \"I hope you're not tricking me. I'm waiting to taste your Ice-Fire Feast. If you win, I might consider your previous suggestion.\" After saying this, her figure flashed again, and she returned to her seat.\n\nZi Qing Meng and Zi Qing Jian's expressions both changed slightly. Zi Qing Jian lowered his head dejectedly, secretly glancing at Feng Nu from the corner of his eye and sighing. Meanwhile, a hint of jealousy flashed in Zi Qing Meng's eyes, her hands gripping the armrests of the chair, and her gaze towards Feng Nu had become somewhat sharp.\n\nHe touched his face; the warm, moist sensation lingered. Nian Bing looked deeply at Feng Nu, then nodded firmly at her, only then walking behind his own kitchen counter. He clearly felt that the blood in his body seemed to be boiling, his hands trembled slightly from excitement, and the joints of his fingers and wrists became even more flexible. He knew this was the feeling of being in peak condition.\n\nHe pressed his hands on the kitchen counter and looked up towards the opposite side. At this moment, Zi Xiu was also looking at him. Their gazes met in the air, creating intense sparks. Zi Xiu smiled, \"Kid, you have a promising future!\"\n\nNian Bing's face flushed, and he returned the smile. \"Compared to you, I'm far from it. Please.\" He took a step back, and faint red and blue light flickered on Nian Bing's skin. His powerful aura suddenly rose, as if what was before him were no longer kitchen utensils and food ingredients, but enemies.\n\nHumpback Chef Zi Xiu didn't move. Instead, he watched Nian Bing, whose aura had suddenly changed. When they first met, Nian Bing had challenged him, and from the confidence Nian Bing had displayed then, it was clear he possessed considerable strength. But at that time, Zi Xiu hadn't paid too much attention. After all, culinary skill is proportional to the depth of one's immersion and experience; in his eyes, Nian Bing was still too green. However, when he just now discovered that Nian Bing simultaneously possessed both Ice and Fire magic, this scorn had already vanished. He knew all too well how Ghost Chef Cha Ji had been defeated back then; magic had a very significant impact on food. Therefore, he didn't dare to be careless in the slightest. The ingredients he had prepared were for his most masterful dish. At this moment, he wasn't in a hurry at all. He wanted to see just how profound the culinary skills of this Nian Bing, whom Feng Nu had spoken of, truly were.\n\nNian Bing raised his right hand and gently waved it forward. \"Whisper of the Free Wind—Arrogant Heaven Blade.\" A brilliant green light burst forth. The unusually shaped Arrogant Heaven Blade plunged into the cutting board with a *thud*. The light radiating from the Wind Whisper Stone rendered the entire kitchen green. The blade vibrated slightly, making a sound like a soft moan, very faint yet so clear. The airflow throughout the kitchen began to move, shifting with the sway of the Arrogant Heaven Blade. That was the rhythm of the wind. Dense wind elements continuously spun around the Arrogant Heaven Blade like a vortex. Zi Meng's family all cultivated wind-attribute Dou Qi. Seeing this peerless divine blade of wind attribute, they couldn't help but change color. As they looked at each other in dismay, Zi Meng exclaimed, \"What a magnificent divine artifact-grade wind-element treasure blade!\" While Hei Ye exclaimed, \"What a magnificent divine artifact-grade wind-attribute magic staff! Too bad I'm not a wind-element magician. Otherwise, I'd definitely borrow it for use.\" Nian Bing had never sealed the Arrogant Heaven Blade with a magic array, because it wasn't needed.\n\n\"Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess—Morning Dew Blade.\" Nian Bing's voice paused slightly. He vibrated his wrist again, and a blue light, with a *thud*, plunged into the cutting board next to the Arrogant Heaven Blade. However, the blue light on the blade was much weaker than the green light of the Arrogant Heaven Blade. Nian Bing's movements didn't stop. His right index finger, imbued with dense ice elements, swiftly outlined a blue magic hexagram. And in the center of the hexagram, he used a dot-etching method to engrave a very small yet exceptionally intricate magic array. Blue light suddenly burst forth, and the magic array directly imprinted itself onto the Ice and Snow Goddess Stone. The restrictive magic array cast upon the divine stone was finally unsealed. In an instant, blue light shot up into the sky. It immediately forced the green light to the side, and the green and blue lights shimmered against each other in the air, contending for supremacy.\n\nIncluding martial arts and magic powerhouses like Zi Meng and Hei Ye, everyone, except Feng Nu, widened their eyes. They all asked themselves, \"Did I see that right? Another divine artifact-grade treasure blade?\"\n\nNian Bing's movements weren't finished yet. The broad and thick Righteous Sun Blade was the last to appear; the temperature that had dropped due to the Morning Dew Blade returned to normal with the appearance of the Righteous Sun Blade. \"Roar of the Fire God—Righteous Sun Blade.\" Red light circulated on the surface of the Righteous Sun Blade. The Fire God Stone seemed alive, radiating scorching light. Green, blue, red—the three-colored lights filled the kitchen with an ethereal, precious aura. Radiating a faint divine glow, they allowed Nian Bing to completely suppress Humpback Chef Zi Xiu in terms of aura. He who would do good work must first sharpen his tools; the appearance of the treasure blades brought Nian Bing's confidence to its peak.\n\nZi Meng smiled slightly. \"Nian Bing,\" he said, \"you have so many treasures. If it weren't for your age being a bit advanced, I'd really want to persuade you to switch to cultivating martial arts.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Dean,\" he said, \"I won't let them be buried. You're right, they are all peerless treasure blades, but they are also my magic staffs, and most importantly, they are the kitchen knives that can fully display my culinary skills. I'm about to begin.\" Hearing the two words \"kitchen knives,\" Zi Meng nearly spurted blood. Such fine treasure blades, actually being used as kitchen knives, he was speechless.\n\nNian Bing grabbed a hen from the nearby ingredients and placed it on the cutting board. He quickly gutted and cleaned it thoroughly, then heated a pot of hot water in a large iron pot. The Whisper of the Free Wind leaped into his hand. The sharpness of Arrogant Heaven Blade, combined with its inherent acceleration ability, produced green, lightning-like blade light that constantly flashed, and the entire chicken was chopped into one-inch square pieces with unadorned, rapid knife work. Nian Bing didn't put the chicken pieces directly into the pot; instead, he placed them in a basin of clean water for washing. The peak showdown began at this moment.\n\nZi Xiu also moved. He also heated a pot of water, but he immediately added scallions, ginger, Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, and a cleaned duck into the water. His movements didn't stop. He took a basin of clean water, a light flashing in his eyes, and took two palm-sized, meat-like but not-meat-like things from the side, placing them in the clean water to soak. He took a mixing bowl and poured flour into it. He thought for a moment, then cracked two eggs into it, added a little water, and began to knead the dough. His movements were slow, but each stroke was exceptionally powerful, and all the dough seemed to adhere to his hands, without a single speck splashing out.\n\nMeanwhile, Nian Bing on his side also began to display his unique culinary skills. The chicken pieces being washed had now been transferred to another basin of water. This time, Nian Bing wasn't simply washing them. Amidst the faint sounds of water, his hands moved faster and faster, like butterflies flitting among flowers, constantly dancing in the water. The rhythmic flipping movements of his hands defied common sense, as if his wrists had no joints at all. Because his hands were so fast, a blur had formed on the water's surface. Yet, strangely, the water didn't splash out due to his hands' interference; instead, it formed regular ripples.\n\n\"Good, the Bone-Separating, Muscle-Dislocating Ruyi Hands. You've indeed learned all of Old Cha's techniques,\" Zi Xiu, who was kneading dough, couldn't help but exclaim in admiration when he saw Nian Bing's hand movements. \"Your mastery is quite good. No wonder you're so confident.\"\n\nNian Bing looked up at Zi Xiu and smiled faintly. \"Senior, you're too kind; it's just a trifling skill.\" Having said this, he changed the water again and continued washing the chicken pieces.\n\nZi Qing Jian, sitting nearby, asked his sister somewhat puzzled, \"Xiao Meng, what do you think Nian Bing is doing? If he washes those chicken pieces any more, they'll fall apart, won't they? The chicken was clean when it was brought here.\"\n\nAt this moment, Zi Qing Meng's eyes held no negative emotions whatsoever, completely replaced by excitement. Zi Qing Jian largely studied the Heavy Eagle Hands to strengthen his martial arts, while she studied culinary arts purely out of interest. Her years of culinary practice had long made her extremely fond of this profession. The peak showdown between two top culinary masters before her had completely engrossed her. At this point, she had already elevated Nian Bing in her heart to a status equal to her uncle Zi Xiu. Hearing her brother's question, she instinctively replied, \"Watch carefully. The Bone-Separating, Muscle-Dislocating Ruyi Hands is one of the seven forbidden techniques in the culinary world, ranking third. It's slightly inferior to Uncle's Bone-Ripping, Muscle-Tearing Heavy Eagle Hands, but from Nian Bing's technique, he has already practiced these Ruyi Hands to a state of perfect fluidity. I really don't know how he trained it. The reason he's using the Bone-Separating, Muscle-Dislocating Ruyi Hands to wash the chicken pieces is to completely wash out the blood and impurities, so it won't affect the chicken's flavor. The most important aspect of the Ruyi Hands is the 'squeeze' technique. Whether applied to kneading dough or washing vegetables, it's the best method. Uncle's Heavy Eagle Hands are different in their application, and it's hard to say which is superior. Ah! No, there's another reason he's using the Bone-Separating, Muscle-Dislocating Ruyi Hands: he wants to crush the chicken bones. It seems he intends to use this to season the soup.\"\n\nThe chicken pieces were finally washed clean. By this time, the water in the iron pot was already boiling. The chicken pieces in Nian Bing's hands had formed a spherical shape, looking somewhat comical. He directly placed the chicken ball into the boiling water. He picked up the Whisper of the Free Wind and, with lightning speed, made a few cuts, and the chicken pieces immediately dispersed into individual small chunks. Nian Bing's movements began to quicken. First, he put the pre-prepared shark's fin into the boiling water. Then, the soaked abalone and sliced shiitake mushrooms went into the water. Next, he added a few ginger slices and scallion segments. Only then did he cover the pot.\n\n---\n**Footnote:**\n\n*   \"青、取之於藍而勝於藍\" (qīng, qǔ zhī yú lán ér shèng yú lán) and \"冰、水為之而寒於水\" (bīng, shuǐ wéi zhī ér hán yú shuǐ) are proverbs. The first literally means 'blue comes from indigo but is bluer than indigo', implying a student surpasses their master. The second means 'ice is made of water but is colder than water', conveying a similar idea of surpassing the origin.",

    "title": "Chapter 53 V Knight God (Part 1)",
    "content": "Nian Bing stepped back, reached out, and grabbed the Zhengyang Blade from the chopping board. With the blade facing down and the Stone of the Fire God facing up, he chanted softly: \"Oh, great God of Flame! Allow me to borrow your left hand, to bring flames down to the human realm, to extinguish all evil forces, to let the flames illuminate the land, and destroy all obstacles in the way! —The Left Hand of the Fire God.\" Red specks of light continuously converged towards the Stone of the Fire God, growing brighter and brighter. Nian Bing pointed the hilt forward, and a massive Left Hand of the Fire God appeared. The entire iron pot floated up, supported by the Left Hand of the Fire God, completely enveloped in flames. Nian Bing suddenly let out a low cry, his left hand drawing a red hexagram in the air. He slapped his palm forward, and the hexagram instantly injected into the Left Hand of the Fire God. In that instant, the originally crimson glow of the Left Hand of the Fire God transformed into purple flame, forcefully elevating the fifth-tier fire magic to the sixth-tier.\n\nHei Ye exclaimed in surprise, \"A magic array for enhancement! I didn't expect this kid to have such a trick up his sleeve.\" For three months, Nian Bing had been discussing the mysteries of dual-element magic with him, but this was the first time he had displayed his talent in magic arrays. Any magic could be enhanced in power through a magic array. However, inscribing a magic array was a difficult part of it. To draw a magic array in the air like Nian Bing and instantly inject it into the magic required a thorough understanding of magic arrays and familiarity with fire elements. Generally speaking, only mages who specialized in studying magic arrays could achieve this.\n\nUnder the effect of the sixth-tier purple flame, the iron pot had been burnt scorching red, but the lid had not been pushed open by the boiling water inside. This was because the lid had completely fused with the iron pot under the extreme heat of the flames. However, the heat inside the pot was constantly expanding, with the potential to explode at any moment. Nian Bing's demeanor was calm. He controlled the Left Hand of the Fire God with purple flame to place the iron pot back onto the stove. His left hand moved close, and three ice needles, transformed from ice spheres, gracefully flew out, instantly creating three small openings in the pot lid. The ice needles, upon entering the pot, naturally turned into water, and the impending explosion of the iron pot was averted as steam rose from the three holes. Nian Bing no longer paid attention to the iron pot; he turned and placed a large winter melon onto the chopping board.\n\nZi Xiu had by now finished kneading the dough; the dough was kneaded into a round ball in his large hands. Nian Bing's actions were entirely under his observation, and he couldn't help but sigh inwardly that using magic in cooking indeed had an inherent advantage. He opened his iron pot. He stirred the ingredients inside. He took out two pieces of material that had been soaking in clear water and placed them on the chopping board. With a loud shout, he slammed his palm onto one of them. With a 'bang,' red juice splattered. Zi Xiu pressed and twisted his palm, instantly flattening the red object onto the chopping board. His right hand formed a claw, darting out and grabbing with lightning speed. With another 'bang,' the other red object was also flattened and pressed onto the chopping board. Immediately after, his hands conjured countless claw shadows; with each strike, his fingers precisely pricked the flattened red objects. His ten fingers, like heavy hammers, continuously pounded, turning the two red objects into a paste. This was the 'heavy' character technique of the Heavy Eagle Hand. In just ten breaths' time, the two red objects had turned into a pulp, yet the chopping board had not sustained any damage under the Heavy Eagle Hand. His control over power had reached its peak. He put the red meat pulp into the pot, and instantly, the original old duck soup released a rich aroma as the pulp was added. Across from him, Nian Bing's nose twitched. He looked up, surprised, at Zi Xiu. \"What a good method! Foie gras pulped into old duck soup! The two ingredients complement each other perfectly, and their flavors are fully brought out. Senior Zi Xiu's skill is indeed exquisite.\" Some foods could have a complementary effect on each other. For example, the old hen and Noon Mushroom Nian Bing used could mutually enhance their aromas, producing the best effect. Coupled with the freshness of abalone and shark fin, and the method of extreme-heat stewing, the flavors of the ingredients were completely fused together. This soup was also the best combination Nian Bing currently knew. However, the combination used by the Camel Chef Zi Xiu was something he had never seen before, but from the aroma, it could be judged that this was definitely a pair of complementary ingredients. To research such a pair of ingredients required countless attempts. Nian Bing had studied cooking for eight years and had only discovered a few simple combinations. Zi Xiu daring to do this showed his depth of research in culinary arts. Zi Xiu and Nian Bing exchanged glances, both showing expressions of mutual appreciation. Although their competition had only just begun, they had already discerned a profound understanding of culinary arts from each other's actions.\n\nNian Bing's culinary art primarily embodied the character '奇' (qi, meaning unique/extraordinary), while Zi Xiu's cooking was by the book, pushing traditional culinary art to its limits. His first movement seemed simple, but without decades of dedicated study and arduous practice, one could never achieve that perfectly flawless state; it could no longer be described as merely skillful. His movements appeared slow, but the result he achieved was something even three ordinary chefs could not accomplish in the same amount of time.\n\nWhat was Nian Bing doing at this moment? The winter melon in his hand had its top removed, and the upper part of the winter melon was cut into a jagged opening with the Aotian Blade. The inner pulp had been scooped out, leaving only a two-inch thick melon wall.\n\nAnyone with a few years of culinary experience would understand that preparing a winter melon in this way was for making a Winter Melon Tureen, using the winter melon as a vessel for soup or porridge. For the aesthetic appeal of the Winter Melon Tureen, carving was indispensable. Generally, various patterns would be carved onto the winter melon skin with a carving knife. But would Nian Bing do that? Of course not. Flat carvings, when used by a chef of his caliber, would only lower his standing. To achieve the best effect, he had already made preparations. He had a plan in mind when he was preparing for the competition with Zi Xiu, though he had no certainty of its success. Taking a deep breath, Nian Bing glanced at Feng Nü beside him. Feng Nü gave him an encouraging look. Nian Bing felt his blood surge in his chest, and his confidence instantly reached its peak.\n\nWith a wave of his right hand, the Aotian Blade returned to the chopping board. By the time his hand returned to his front, it had swapped to the Morning Dew Blade. He carefully placed the bottomless Winter Melon Tureen into the center of a large plate, about two feet in diameter. After adjusting its position and confirming the winter melon was perfectly centered, he took a deep breath, and Nian Bing's hand moved. The blade's shadow, hazy blue*, seemed to bring forth a layer of icy mist. With a light chop, a winter melon skin as thin as a thread instantly separated from the winter melon itself, lying flat on the plate. The Cleaver Thread-Cutting Technique, his most familiar blade technique, reappeared. However, this time he wasn't completely cutting threads; instead, he was peeling. Hazy blue radiance continuously flickered on the plate, and each strip of green melon peel lay evenly flat on the plate. Its exquisite precision was perfect to the slightest detail, with only minimal and extremely uniform gaps between each strand of winter melon peel.\n\nZi Qingmeng had by now stood up due to excitement. \"The Silk Reeling and Cocoon Unreeling Blade Technique! Although it's not one of the Five Great Blade Techniques, if there were a sixth, it would surely be this Silk Reeling and Cocoon Unreeling!\" She knew very well that, judging by the blade skills Nian Bing had displayed, his culinary art was certainly no less than that of her uncle. It was important to know that blade techniques could not be faked and had no relation to magic; this was definitely the result of arduous practice.\n\nGently rotating the plate, Nian Bing's expression remained completely unchanged, like a still ancient well. His blade light flickered, and the icy mist brought forth by Morning Dew had permeated the entire winter melon. The reason for peeling it with the thread-cutting method was simple: he wanted the outer circumference of the Winter Melon Tureen to remain as round as possible, and the finer the winter melon peel was cut, the easier it would be to achieve his goal.\n\nZi Xiu also saw Nian Bing's Silk Reeling and Cocoon Unreeling Blade Technique, and a look of surprise flashed in his eyes. However, the movements of his hands did not stop. A strip of pork loin, about a foot long, was placed on his chopping board. He then took out the kneaded dough and, using a pressing and kneading method, shaped the dough to be exactly like the pork loin. The two different ingredients were placed vertically on the chopping board in front of him. The next moment, he began to pound. His movements were violent, like a raging storm; each strike embodied a furious momentum. The 'bang bang' sounds were like beating drums, his left hand pounding the dough and his right hand pounding the meat, continuously repeating the same actions.\n\nNian Bing finished peeling the winter melon skin amidst the 'bang bang' sounds from Zi Xiu's side. The winter melon, stripped of its dark green skin, revealed translucent winter melon flesh, like jadeite. All the winter melon skin had formed a circular base on the plate, as if it were lotus leaves beneath the Winter Melon Tureen. Of course, the translucence of the Winter Melon Tureen was not merely inherent; it was also the task of the Morning Dew Blade. The reason Nian Bing chose Morning Dew instead of the faster Aotian Blade was to evenly inject ice elements into the Winter Melon Tureen during the thread-cutting process. At this moment, the Winter Melon Tureen had completely transformed into a frozen state, though it was indiscernible from its appearance. Nian Bing had his reasons for doing this; it was preparation for subsequent actions. Winter melon flesh was relatively soft, and if it were just ordinary carving, he might have been able to complete it. However, to defeat the Camel Chef Zi Xiu, he had to attempt a realm he had never achieved before, so he could not be careless in the slightest. A blue light flashed, and the Morning Dew Blade returned to the chopping board. Nian Bing did not continue his actions but stared motionless at the Winter Melon Tureen in front of him. The winter melon's texture was very fine. At this moment, his mind was solely focused on the jade-like material.\n\nA light flashed, and Nian Bing took out the cloth pouch containing the Ghost Carving blades from his spatial ring. The Ghost Carving Divine Blades referred not to a single blade but a set of blades. When Cha Ji had passed this set of Ghost Carving blades to him, he had once said that the nine Ghost Carving blades were forged from Deep Sea Sunken Silver and then tempered with various medicinal herbs for several years. Not only were they extremely hard, but they also possessed a spiritual essence. Their spiritual essence could only be fully realized under the effect of the Dragon Soaring Dance Blade Technique. The peak of blade skill could only be displayed when one's spirit and blade completely fused into one. The Ghost Carving blades and the person wielding them were equally important.\n\nThe largest of the Ghost Carving blades leaped into Nian Bing's hand. He wasn't in a hurry to start cutting; instead, he first scooped out a small bowl of rice, poured it into a clean small basin, and added clear water to soak it.\n\nZi Xiu had already seen Nian Bing's actions. He inwardly exclaimed, \"Ghost Carving!\" and wondered with some doubt, \"Could this kid have really mastered the Dragon Soaring Dance Blade Technique?\"\n\nNian Bing lifted the large plate, two feet in diameter. Just as he did when he created the Nine Azure Divine Dragon Ice Cloud Concealment, he condensed a block of solid ice beneath the plate. The plate rested on it, and with a gentle push, it immediately began to spin rapidly. Nian Bing slightly adjusted the angle of the plate's rotation, making the bottom of the plate perfectly align with its center. At this moment, the rice soaking in water had begun to emit faint crackling sounds, the sound of water permeating the rice. This was merely a small trick for steaming rice: soaking the rice in water for a period before steaming not only made it easier to cook but also tasted better due to more even heating. While Nian Bing was doing all this, his gaze never left the Winter Melon Tureen. His right hand extended flat in front of him, the approximately five-inch-long Ghost Carving blade shimmering with a faint cold light. \"Ghostly craft, divine work, ethereal blue powder; Carve dragon, sculpt phoenix, a blade of chill.\" The first character he uttered was firm and powerful. The Ghost Carving blade moved when the last character, \"chill\" (寒), finished. With a thrust of his palm upwards, the Ghost Carving blade was tossed up five inches. Nian Bing flipped his palm, and his fingers, as if stuck to the Ghost Carving blade, pierced towards the Winter Melon Tureen. The Dragon Soaring Dance Blade Technique, renowned as the culinary world's foremost divine blade technique, now appeared in the human realm.\n\nA faint blue light pulsed at his fingertips. Each tremor caused nine blades—nine is the ultimate number. Just as Nian Bing had expected, what fell from the Winter Melon Tureen under the effect of the Ghost Carving blades was not mere debris, but rather fine, cyan frost mist, like hoarfrost. The Ghost Carving blade continuously flickered at the same spot, and the faint blue light cluster appeared and disappeared as if exploding. At this moment, Nian Bing's mind had completely merged with the blade's intent, forgetting the competition, forgetting everything. In his eyes, in his heart, in his hands, there was only the blade, only that faint blue light cluster. His fingers and wrist were exceptionally soft, enveloped in the blue light cluster, making it impossible to distinguish between blade shadows and hand shadows. Only the cyan frost mist continuously floated out, quietly falling onto the previously peeled winter melon threads.\n\nZi Xiu continued to pound the dough and pork loin on the chopping board, palm by palm, but his gaze remained fixed on Nian Bing's hands. After twenty years, seeing the culinary world's ultimate blade technique once again, how could he not be excited? The Dragon Soaring Dance! It truly was the Dragon Soaring Dance! From Nian Bing's demeanor and the flickering blade light in his hand, he seemed to see the Ghost Chef who had suppressed him his entire life. The Ghost Chef's magnificent style had reappeared. His eyes were already moist at the corners. \"Cha Ji, oh Cha Ji,\" he thought, \"it seems I'm not only inferior to you in culinary skills, but I'm also far worse than you at teaching apprentices.\"\n\nHis left hand continuously rotated the plate, making the Winter Melon Tureen on top spin faster and faster. In Nian Bing's mind, the azure giant dragon from back then appeared. Every aspect of the giant dragon's demeanor, as if alive, transformed into the blade's edge in his hand. Azure Dragon Karodiris: its roar, its pounce, its wing-flapping dragon cry—all were so vivid in Nian Bing's mind.\n\n---\n**Footnote:**\n* The original Chinese phrase \"藍蒙葬禮\" (lán méng zàng lǐ) literally means \"blue shroud funeral.\" This phrasing is highly unusual in this context and appears to be either a poetic and obscure description of the blade's misty blue effect, or a typographical error for \"藍濛濛\" (lán méng méng), meaning \"hazy blue.\" Given the description of \"icy mist\" and \"hazy blue radiance\" immediately following, the latter interpretation is favored for readability and contextual sense.",

    "content": "Cha Ji had never seen a dragon, but Nian Bing had. The Azure Dragon Carodylis was a true giant dragon. No matter how profound Cha Ji's knife skills were at his peak during the summer, he only had the imagined form of a dragon, not its true divine essence. Perhaps Nian Bing's knife skills had not yet reached Cha Ji's level, but in grasping the divine essence of the dragon, he had already surpassed his master. Therefore, his Ghost Carving came alive, and the dragon came alive too.\n\nCarving didn't necessarily require a long time to achieve its best expression, especially under the effect of Ghost Carving. Nian Bing's voice was filled with cold arrogance. The incantation finally appeared.\n\n\"Where Ghost Hand falls, heaven and earth tremble.\" As if at that instant, he *was* Ghost Carving. Orchid-blue light transformed into a dragon, continuously imprinting itself onto the winter melon tureen.\n\n\"Carved into billows, a hundred revolutions.\" The blade turned, and the orchid-blue light, like surging waves, ceaselessly assailed the jade-like winter melon before him.\n\n\"Divine craftsmanship of ages, now present.\" The knife technique changed again, from delicate to bold and sweeping. Each downward stroke created a deep gully.\n\n\"Blade rises, crescent moon reflects in cold spring.\" The orchid-blue light suddenly scattered into ten thousand rays of brilliance. A crescent moon seemed to appear on the winter melon tureen, which was completely rendered silver-white. The orchid-blue light, flowing like spring water, lightly moisturized every corner of the tureen. The miraculous knife technique was elevated in that instant. A faint dragon aura continuously revolved around the winter melon tureen, and the orchid-blue light receded. Surrounding the winter melon tureen was a lingering white mist, adding a touch of mystery to the entire tureen.\n\nGhost Carving retreated. Nian Bing's right hand was trembling slightly. From the previous carving, even he didn't know how many strokes he had made. The strength in his fingers and wrist had been pushed to their limit. He knew that for at least three days, his right hand wouldn't be able to do anything else. However, his mood at that moment was incomparably joyful. Because he knew he had succeeded. He had finally managed to grasp the essence of the Dragon Weeping Gathering Dance, finding the feeling of spirit and culinary art integrating as one. Not only would the Dragon Weeping Gathering Dance enter the realm of great mastery, but his understanding of culinary art also entered another realm.\n\nBreathing slightly, Nian Bing looked at the winter melon tureen before him. The rotating plate gradually came to a stop. The ice mist also gradually receded. Except for Nian Bing himself and Zi Xiu, everyone else showed disappointment. Because, on the jade-like winter melon tureen, they only saw crisscrossing, irregular patterns. Moreover, around these patterns, white winter melon powder was scattered. The only somewhat peculiar thing was that on the upper edge of the winter melon tureen, three equidistant points each had an extra protrusion. No one knew how they were formed. But these protrusions looked odd and showed no sign of peculiarity. Compared to the magnificent blade light, the result was clearly unsatisfying. Even Zi Mengqing sat back down in her seat with disappointment.\n\nNian Bing expressionlessly glanced at the winter melon tureen, then took the rice nearby. After draining the water, he suddenly flicked his wrist, and the wet rice in the bowl instantly shot high into the air. Morning Dew Blade struck, instantly drawing four blade shadows in the air, completely encircling the rice within the blade light. The basin that had held the rice spun once in the air, and all the rice returned to the basin with a crisp clinking sound. Not a single grain escaped.\n\nPouring the rice onto the cutting board, Nian Bing picked up a piece of cloth and wrapped it around his right hand, then tightly bound his bandaged wrist. This time, he used his left hand to retrieve a Ghost Carving blade, the third smallest in the series from largest to smallest. The blade was much smaller than the previous one, its tip only half the width of a willow leaf. It was a pity he couldn't use his right hand now, but the dish before him still needed to be finished. His left hand moved. This time, his target was the rice. Of course, no matter how skilled he was, he couldn't carve any patterns on rice now. What he needed to do was both simple and difficult. With a flash of the blade, a single grain of rice was picked up and dropped into the iron basin. At this point, the rice was no longer its original oval shape but had become perfectly round. This single picking motion completed the task of rounding. If it weren't for the astonishing eyesight of those present, they would surely have thought he was doing something useless. Rice is very brittle, and it remains brittle even after freezing. However, after freezing, while brittle, it becomes much harder. It was this hardness that Nian Bing wanted. Having performed the Dragon Weeping Gathering Dance with his right hand, this time, his left hand performed the Brocade Character Empty Window Picking Character Technique. The Brocade Character Empty Window, skilled at carving characters, made rounding something simple. The knife tip continuously picked, each stroke picking out a grain of rice. As the blade light grew faster and faster, the number of rice grains on the cutting board diminished. When the last grain of rice entered the basin, only a pile of fragments remained on the table. Nian Bing did not discard the fragments; instead, he carefully placed them into a plate. Upon completing all this, a faint smile finally appeared on his face. He glanced at his bandaged right hand, then looked up towards Zi Xiu.\n\nAt this moment, Zi Xiu was still pressing the dough and meat. As Nian Bing looked up at him, Zi Xiu opened the lid of the pot nearby. A rich aroma immediately filled the entire kitchen. Zi Xiu took a deep breath, nodding with a hint of self-satisfaction. With a shake of his left hand, he picked up a large skimmer and scooped all the ingredients from the pot. Although this action seemed very simple, Nian Bing's heart skipped a beat. This single scoop was by no means as simple as it appeared on the surface. First, the timing: the moment the skimmer struck was precisely when the broth was boiling most intensely. Furthermore, the skimmer appeared to move once, but in reality, it flashed seven consecutive times, changing angles seven times, scooping out all the ingredients from the broth. This one scoop fully demonstrated Camel Chef's exquisite culinary skill. Nian Bing knew he couldn't replicate it.\n\nZi Xiu looked up at Nian Bing, grinning strangely. \"Kid, tired? Mine's almost done over here. Looks like we're taking two extremes: I simplify the complex, and you complicate the simple. Watch closely.\" He turned the dough on the cutting board horizontally, then placed the meat on top of the dough. Everyone was astonished to find that the dough and meat, which had been pressed earlier, were identical in shape. When the meat landed on the dough, the dough beneath was completely invisible, and the meat didn't protrude in the slightest. Zi Xiu pressed down on the meat, then inserted his right index finger beneath the dough, his fingertip flicking upwards. The piece where dough and meat adhered flew into the air. The dough piece rotated in the air. Zi Xiu glanced at Nian Bing and shouted in a deep voice, \"Tearing and Rending, Heavy Hawk Hand!\" In that instant, his originally somewhat lewd appearance suddenly exuded a powerful aura. His hands shot out like lightning, transforming into countless hand shadows. Azure light appeared at his fingertips. The sound of tearing fabric resonated, and the dough piece split into two. Strangely, the tenacity of the meat was no less than that of the dough. After being torn into two pieces, they still maintained their original overlaid appearance, without the slightest change. Zi Xiu's movements didn't stop. The two torn pieces of dough were overlapped and torn again. The sound of tearing fabric continuously echoed as the dough and meat combined, then the dough pieces continuously split, recombined, split again, and recombined. Seeing this, Nian Bing couldn't help but show a solemn expression. He knew very well that Zi Xiu's earlier method of kneading and pressing the dough and meat must have been very special, allowing him to push their tenacity to the limit. If he wasn't mistaken, the dough and meat were now as tough as cloth. Even he might not be able to tear them apart.\n\nAfter Zi Xiu tore it nine times consecutively, the dough piece had transformed into five hundred and twelve red and white intermingled threads. He didn't continue tearing. With a flick of his wrist, the threads quickly spun together, like a twisted rope, their red and white alternating colors exceptionally striking. Nian Bing secretly admired him; just distinguishing the texture of the meat threads would have been incredibly difficult. And Zi Xiu had wielded the Tearing and Rending, Heavy Hawk Hand to its extreme, using special techniques from the very beginning when he processed the meat and dough. Besides that miraculous Tearing Technique, his slow kneading process also achieved an effect no less than his own Dislocating Sinews and Bones, Wishful Hand.\n\nThe dough threads coiled into a ball. The azure light on Zi Xiu's hands suddenly intensified. Both hands moved simultaneously, gripping the threads from both ends towards the center, causing one finger print after another to appear on the threads. When the threads were covered in finger prints, he began tearing again. This time, the patterns changed, and a strange scene appeared: each thread became alternately white and red, as if the meat threads and dough threads were truly adhered together. After he had torn it nine more times, he held one end of the threads, approached the pot, and from behind his waist, his right hand produced a short azure blade, identical to the one Zi Mengqing used.\n\nNian Bing, of course, knew what Zi Xiu was about to perform and couldn't help but widen his eyes. Zi Xiu's movements were very slow. The blade moved forward gently, stopping an inch from the threads. The four characters \"Emerald Curtain Dignified\" were spoken syllable by syllable. From the moment the first character, 'cui' (emerald), was uttered, his wrist began to tremble rhythmically. When the last character, 'ning' (dignified/condense), resounded, the blade suddenly reverted to a stationary state. But at that moment, everyone clearly felt that the blade had come alive. Piercing shrieks erupted from the blade. The single blade suddenly transformed into hundreds, and azure light scattered like an explosion, completely engulfing the threads before him. The greatest characteristic of Emerald Curtain Dignified lay in the character 'ning'; it was about an instantaneous burst from stillness to motion. The threads entered the pot. Zi Xiu closed the lid, thrust the short blade into the cutting board before him, and looked at Nian Bing. \"The key to Emerald Curtain Dignified lies in the character 'ning'. The biggest characteristic of this knife technique is the word 'speed'. Even your Dragon Weeping Gathering Dance cannot be faster than me. And the characteristic of Dragon Weeping Gathering Dance lies in the word 'dance'. Dance has spirituality. Emerald Curtain Dignified is indeed inferior to Dragon Weeping Gathering Dance, with a gap in spirituality. Finally, we'll compare the taste.\" As he spoke, he reopened the lid, stirred the contents a few times with chopsticks, quickly added over ten kinds of seasoning, and continued, \"My noodles still need to cook for a while. Now it's your turn.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded at Zi Xiu. Although his right hand still couldn't display its original nimbleness, it was at least no longer trembling. He reached out and took the pre-prepared tofu. This time, his knife movements were very slow, carefully cutting the tofu into one-inch square pieces. His right hand, unable to wield the knife, slid over the tofu, and the soft tofu instantly turned into hard tofu blocks. Everything was ready. Now, the final processing was needed. Nian Bing approached the iron pot over the fire. With a wave of his Ao Tian Dao, a blade aura flew out gracefully, lifting the lid, which was connected to the pot, and letting it fall to the side. A rich fragrance emerged with the rising steam. The aroma of chicken, shiitake mushrooms, abalone, and shark fin had perfectly merged during the braising process. Nian Bing smiled slightly, also using a skimmer to scoop out the ingredients from the pot. However, while Camel Chef Zi Xiu used only one scoop, Nian Bing needed three to clear all the remnants from the pot. The round ice rice went into the pot. Muttering a few incantations, his right hand, which could not exert force, actually pressed directly onto the scorching hot pot. When his hand met the pot, his entire palm turned completely purple. This was the effect of Purple Flame Art.\n\nIn an instant, the broth in the pot began to violently churn, continuously tossing the round ice rice grains. Nian Bing's left hand picked up a pair of chopsticks, and he looked up at Zi Xiu with a faint smile. He extended his hand directly above the pot, inserting the chopsticks and stirring gently. His hand moved rhythmically. Gradually, under the steady action of Nian Bing's left hand, a whirlpool began to form on the surface of the water, and the previous boiling disappeared. His right hand continued to heat, and his left hand continued to rotate. The broth, which had long surpassed its boiling point, somehow no longer boiled. The bead-shaped rice was evenly distributed in every corner of the pot, spinning rapidly with the whirlpool. Nian Bing's left hand at this point emitted a ball of flame, keeping the surrounding hot steam at bay.\n\nZi Xiu's body trembled. He said, somewhat startled, \"Breaking Water, Preserving Noodles, Mysterious Jade Hand! No, it should be Breaking Water, Preserving Noodles, Flame Hand now. When did Cha Ji learn this move?\"\n\nNian Bing's hands didn't stop moving. He looked up and smiled faintly. \"This wasn't taught to me by Master. In fact, I'm just imitating what I've seen. I haven't yet truly grasped the rhythm of the original Breaking Water, Preserving Noodles, Mysterious Jade Hand. However, doing it this way is already much better than direct boiling, as it allows for more even heating.\" Normally, cooking porridge would take about half an *shichen* for the rice to completely soften into porridge, but under the heating of Purple Flame Art, Nian Bing achieved his goal in only a quarter of that time. The chopsticks lifted out of the water. He put the tofu into the pot, then took bamboo shoots from the prepared ingredients nearby. Under the rapid swings of Ao Tian Dao, the bamboo shoots turned into tiny jade-green cubes and entered the pot. Nian Bing placed both hands on the iron pot, simultaneously using Purple Flame Art to rapidly heat it.",

    "content": "\"Senior Zi Xiu, we can serve our dishes together now.\" As he spoke, Nian Bing raised both hands, imbued with Purple Flame Art, and swept them towards the previously prepared winter melon tureen. A scorching airflow swept over the winter melon tureen, and the layer of frosty mist on it melted like ice and snow. Winter melon powder drifted down from beneath the tureen, forming a neat circle, while the tureen itself regained its original emerald green. Under the effect of the searing Purple Flame Art, the entire winter melon tureen appeared so green it seemed to be dripping water, truly as captivating as jadeite. At this moment, everyone's eyes were wide, for they realized they had misjudged earlier.\n\nHow could the Ghost Carving Divine Knife make a mistake once it was wielded? If it truly made a mistake, then it wouldn't be the Ghost Carving Divine Knife. What appeared on the surface of the winter melon tureen was not ordinary carving, but bas-relief. The entire winter melon tureen was about half an inch thinner than its original form, and its surface was adorned with nine coiling green dragons, each so lifelike that even their scales could be clearly seen. To Zi Xiu, the Camel Chef, it was astonishing that these nine green dragons seemed alive, each exhibiting a different posture: some spreading their wings to strike, some reaching out their claws to grab, some soaring high, some roaring upwards, some soaring through clouds and mist. The nine green dragons intertwined flawlessly, without a single imperfection or misplacement. The three protrusions previously on top of the winter melon tureen were clearly three dragon heads, even their whiskers were distinctly present, formed from winter melon carved from other parts, and after the baptism of ice and fire, they had completely fused into one. For a moment, there was pin-drop silence in the entire kitchen, and even Nian Bing's own eyes revealed a hint of enchantment.\n\nIt was time to serve the dish. Before serving, Nian Bing added a little salt to the pot, then poured the white and green mixed porridge liquid into the winter melon tureen. His movements were very careful, fearing he might damage any part of the winter melon tureen. The white rice, like tiny pearls, was on the verge of melting but not quite; the green bamboo shoots, like jadeite; and the glistening tofu, like suet jade. What he had made was a porridge dish.\n\nZi Xiu and Nian Bing served their dishes simultaneously. Zi Xiu's broth was golden-red, poured into a large bowl with a rich aroma. Extremely fine noodles, much thinner than silk threads, were present within, with red, gold, and white colors intermingling. Although it lacked Nian Bing's magnificent presentation, no one doubted its deliciousness. Both men took their respective creations to the five onlookers. Feng Nü stared blankly at Nian Bing and said, \"Can this thing be eaten?\"\n\nNian Bing paused, then laughed lightly, \"Are you doubting my cooking? Don't worry, there's no poison.\"\n\nFeng Nü shook her head and said, \"No, I just… I'm a little reluctant to eat it. What's the name of this dish of yours?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Go ahead and eat, don't worry. If you like it, I'll make it for you again in the future. The name of this dish is: Ice-Fire Nine Heavens: Nine-Dragon Supreme Cauldron.\"\n\nZi Xiu grumbled irritably, \"Nine-Dragon Supreme Cauldron, indeed. It's clearly just the Pearl, Jadeite, White Jade Congee that old ghost Cha Ji excels at.\"\n\nNian Bing showed no anger whatsoever. He smiled slightly and said, \"That's true, it just has a few added variations. Senior, that bowl of yours should be the Red Powder Golden Jade Noodles that my master highly praises, right?\"\n\nZi Xiu snorted, saying, \"Come on, everyone, have a taste. It's been a long time since I cooked myself. Wonder if I've gotten rusty.\"\n\nEveryone moved simultaneously. Zi Xiu's face immediately darkened, because everyone's target was Nian Bing's Nine-Dragon Supreme Cauldron, and not a single person touched his Red Powder Golden Jade Noodles. It was the honest and straightforward Zi Qing Jian, a genuinely kind person, who, seeing that his uncle's noodles were untouched, withdrew the spoon he had stretched towards the Nine-Dragon Supreme Cauldron and went to eat the noodles instead.\n\nNian Bing walked over to Zi Xiu, smiling slightly, \"Senior, if you don't mind, let's taste each other's dishes. Although noodles might seem simple, what you've made is truly extraordinary.\" This piece of flattery made Zi Xiu's expression soften a bit. He nodded, and they each began eating the other's creation.\n\nNo one spoke, there weren't even exclamations of praise, because everyone was engrossed in eating.\n\nSoon, only the cauldron remained of Nian Bing's Nine-Dragon Supreme Cauldron; he hadn't even had a chance to eat a single bite himself. What was astounding was that the one who ate the most was none other than Zi Meng, the Dean of Orchid Dream Academy. He fully utilized his Martial Saint strength, spooning out food like lightning, generously stuffing the delicious cuisine into his mouth.\n\n\"Zi Meng, are you bullying people by being fast-handed? This was made by my disciple for me to eat!\" While others dared not speak up or accuse, Hei Ye was not so reserved. Among those vying for the Pearl, Jadeite, White Jade Congee, he was the only one without martial skills, and magic was completely useless at this moment, so he ended up eating the least.\n\nAfter eating a small bowl of Zi Xiu's Red Powder Golden Jade Noodles, Nian Bing turned to face Zi Xiu, \"Senior, the noodles you've made possess perfect color, aroma, taste, intent, and form. Especially the application of the Live-Tear, Split-Open Heavy Eagle Hand, it leaves this junior thoroughly outclassed. No matter what, I could never make such delicious noodles. Without the Water-Breaking Noodle-Preserving Method, these incredibly fine noodles surprisingly don't stick together at all. And because they are inherently very resilient, during the extremely fine preparation process, the heat was just right, and every single strand fully absorbed the rich aroma of old duck soup and foie gras sauce. Truly a supreme delicacy!\"\n\nZi Xiu smiled indifferently and said, \"Nian Bing, who do you think won this match between us?\"\n\nNian Bing hesitated for a moment, then said, \"Senior, to be precise, I won. Your creation and my Nine-Dragon Supreme Cauldron each have their unique characteristics in terms of aroma. However, your old duck and foie gras soup is valuable for its innovation, and its ingredients are much cheaper than mine, yet it can produce an aroma capable of competing equally. Therefore, in the category of aroma, you won. As for the taste of the noodles, through your Live-Tear, Split-Open Heavy Eagle Hand, it's also slightly superior to my Pearl, Jadeite, White Jade Congee, but the deliciousness of both is extremely close. In these two categories, you won. Am I right?\"\n\nZi Xiu smiled slightly and said, \"Kid, in terms of culinary skills, you truly have extraordinary talent. Yes, what you said is very apt, but a bit too humble. I've tasted your congee. If it were ordinary Pearl, Jadeite, White Jade Congee, I'd indeed be confident in surpassing you in taste. However, yours is completely different. It lives up to its name, Ice-Fire Nine Heavens. Through special heating methods and extreme freezing of the ingredients, the flavors presented are distinctly different. I can discern eighty-one variations within it—that must be your Ice-Fire Nine Heavens, right? Incorporating magic into cooking can indeed make the taste of food ever-changing. No wonder you were so confident. A loss is a loss, you don't need to cover for me.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Zi Xiu, who had frankly conceded defeat, and his admiration grew. He respectfully said, \"This junior's culinary skills still lack much in terms of heat control. If I hadn't used magic as a trick, I could never have compared to Senior. This time was just a stroke of luck.\"\n\nZi Xiu shook his head and said, \"Where is there so much luck? Although incorporating magic into cooking can produce unique effects, without long hours of practice and insight, how could you combine magic and culinary art so well? However, there are still some flaws. The transitions are not delicate enough, and your ingredient processing is still a bit rough. You need to pay more attention in the future. Your appearance will undoubtedly bring enormous changes to the culinary world. As for what it will become, I don't know. Nian Bing, while your Ice-Fire Nine Heavens is marvelous, it's not what surprised me the most. After all, incorporating magic into cooking inherently has its own advantages. Do you know? In fact, the moment you fully displayed your Dragon's Fluttering Dance Gathering, I knew I had lost. Even if I could surpass you in aroma and taste, in terms of color, form, and intent, there was no way I could compare to your Nine-Dragon Supreme Cauldron. I just hadn't expected your Dragon's Fluttering Dance Gathering to have already surpassed your master's.\"\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile, \"Senior, you flatter me. Perhaps you won't believe it, but if I were to do that again, I would absolutely be unable to create the same thing. During the carving process just now, I completely immersed myself in a wondrous realm; I didn't even know how many cuts I made, but the moment it was completed, I clearly felt that I had succeeded.\"\n\nZi Xiu smiled slightly and said, \"Feeling is very important; don't underestimate yourself. You have already entered the realm of cooking through insight. Perhaps your knife skills are not yet as refined as your master's, but in the understanding of Dragon's Fluttering Dance Gathering, your master cannot compare to you. To achieve such results at such a young age, the future title of the continent's number one chef undoubtedly belongs to you.\" He picked up the last piece of tofu from the bowl with his chopsticks, chewed it contentedly, and said somewhat indistinctly, \"This tofu is really good. Tofu usually doesn't absorb flavor easily, but after your freezing, though its surface didn't change much, many small holes appeared inside, allowing it to fully absorb the deliciousness of the soup. Moreover, during extreme heat processing, it doesn't crumble and instead becomes even more resilient. It's truly delicious. Nian Bing, that touch of salt you added at the end served as the finishing touch, making the Ice-Fire Nine Heavens sensation richer. You should continue to promote this. Remember, salt is the king of all flavors; any umami flavor with the addition of salt will become different.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded sincerely and said, \"Thank you, Senior. Senior, are you...\"\n\nZi Xiu naturally knew what Nian Bing wanted to ask. He used battle qi to transmit sound in a line, speaking something to him. After a while, Nian Bing's eyes revealed a look of horror, \"This, how is this possible? That person's identity...\"\n\nZi Xiu made a shushing gesture to Nian Bing and smiled slightly, \"Didn't you once say in class that nothing is impossible? Now do you understand why your master didn't want you to avenge him? The opponent's identity is so troublesome; he wouldn't want his only precious disciple to get into trouble. What's more, your master probably never forgot that person until the day he died.\"\n\nNian Bing was a little dazed. If his master had never forgotten that woman, then was it right for him to avenge him? He shook his head. Forget it. Whether it was to avenge his master or not, he still had to meet that woman. Perhaps her attitude would help him decide many things. Thinking this, he turned to Zi Xiu, the Camel Chef, and said, \"Senior, thank you for telling me this. If you don't mind, I'd like to eat some more Red Powder Golden Jade Noodles.\"\n\nZi Xiu chuckled, saying, \"Ah, I'm afraid it's not your turn, is it? Look behind you.\"\n\nNian Bing froze for a moment. When he looked back, he saw that the eyes of everyone who had previously gathered around his Nine-Dragon Supreme Cauldron had now fallen upon the Red Powder Golden Jade Noodles in front of him. The hungry desire in their eyes sent a chill down Nian Bing's spine. He quickly took a step back and made a gesture of invitation.\n\nThis time, Feng Nü was the quickest. With a scoop of her chopsticks, a bowl of noodles was filled. Nian Bing suddenly realized that in front of delicious food, the word \"lady\" held no meaning whatsoever. Not just Feng Nü, even the usually reserved Zi Qing Meng was now snatching the delicious noodles as if facing a formidable enemy.\n\nZi Xiu circled around the crowd and came before Nian Bing's Nine-Dragon Supreme Cauldron, which now only had the winter melon remaining. He leaned in and examined it carefully, unable to stop exclaiming in admiration. Everything was so delicate and vivid; the nine green dragons had not a single flaw and looked so delicious. Unfortunately, the Pearl, Jadeite, White Jade Congee in the cauldron was completely gone, not even dregs remained, and even the inner winter melon wall had been scraped. With a light sigh, he couldn't help but say, \"If this were truly made of jade, it would absolutely be a rare treasure! Truly worthy of being the continent's number one knife technique in the culinary world. Even if my Jade Curtain Serenity were more exquisite, it couldn't display the power of Dragon's Fluttering Dance Gathering like this. Nian Bing, you've truly mastered your craft. Ice-Fire Nine Heavens: Nine-Dragon Supreme Cauldron, what a magnificent name!\"\n\nNian Bing glanced at Zi Xiu and said, \"Senior, the reason I was so eager to compete with you this time is because I'm afraid I have to leave here soon. A friend asked me to do something, and I must hurry to do it.\" As he spoke, he walked to the chopping board and retrieved his three kitchen knives into his Spatial Ring.\n\nA hint of disappointment appeared in Zi Xiu's eyes. \"You're leaving already? I asked you to be the knife skills instructor for the culinary department, and you haven't fulfilled a single day of a teacher's duties yet.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Senior, I really like the environment here, especially sparring with you and Teacher Hei Ye. If I accomplish my aspirations in the future, I will definitely return.\"\n\nA flicker of light appeared in Zi Xiu's eyes. He gave Nian Bing a firm pat on the shoulder and said, \"As an excellent chef, various different experiences are essential. Go. I won't hinder your progress; the future culinary world is yours. However, you must remember, no matter what level your culinary skills reach, you must never show the slightest bit of arrogance. Otherwise, you will inevitably suffer setbacks, just like your master. It was because of a moment of carelessness, underestimating his opponent, and simply casually making a few dishes. Otherwise, even with magic assistance, how could his opponent's culinary achievements compare to those of the Ghost Chef?\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing nodded: \"Thank you. I will definitely bear your words in mind.\"\n\nZi Xiu asked: \"When do you plan to leave?\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment: \"Today, I suppose. Feng Nü came to the academy to challenge today, and I've already revealed my dual-element magic. If I stay any longer, I'll inevitably run into some unnecessary trouble.\"\n\nChef Luochu Zixiu nodded: \"Alright then. You'd leave sooner or later, and I can't keep you anyway. I'll wait for you to return later. I hope you'll be able to take over my position then; I'd like to enjoy a few years of carefree living.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, whispering: \"Aren't you carefree enough as it is?\"\n\nA lewd glint flashed in Zi Xiu's eyes. He glanced at Feng Nü, who was continuously spooning crimson powder golden jade noodles into her mouth, and transmitted his voice to Nian Bing: \"Kid, strike while the iron's hot. In my life, I've had countless women, but I've truly never encountered such an absolute stunner. She seems quite fond of you. Find an opportunity to get her into bed. Women, you know, they remember their first man very deeply. As long as your skills are good enough, you won't have to worry about her leaving you. Looking at you, you must still be a little virgin boy. The taste of a beauty is absolutely a delight beyond compare, better than even the finest dishes.\"\n\nSeveral years later, Nian Bing fully comprehended what Zi Xiu had said then. However, by that time, he was already a generation's grandmaster in the culinary world. After two emotions, he had researched a third.\n\n\"I'm so full! This trip was truly well worth it, Nian Bing. Your food is really delicious; I'm almost reluctant to leave you,\" Feng Nü said, satisfied, as she put down her bowl and looked at Nian Bing. Her eyes were full of smiles.\n\nPerhaps influenced by Zi Xiu, Nian Bing took two steps forward, approached Feng Nü, and whispered: \"I won, so shouldn't you fulfill your promise and let me kiss you?\"\n\nFeng Nü giggled: \"Did I promise you anything? I only said I could *consider* it if you won. Besides, I already... already kissed you earlier. Consider it an advance payment.\"\n\nNian Bing said, dissatisfied: \"How can that be considered an an advance payment? Anyway, you owe me one. Alright, let's not talk about that for now. When do you plan to leave? Where are you going?\"\n\nFeng Nü looked at the people around her and said: \"I'll leave now. My goal has been achieved, and I've eaten so many good things. It's time to go. If fate allows, we'll meet again.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Feng Nü, a lost expression on his face, and said: \"I'm leaving here too. I'm going to Aolan City. It would be great if we were going the same way.\"\n\nFeng Nü looked at him in surprise: \"You're not continuing your studies here?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head: \"No, I've learned a lot in these three months. It's time for me to leave.\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled, a playful look in her beautiful eyes: \"Do you really have business in Aolan City?\"\n\nNian Bing was startled for a moment, but his reaction was quick. He said, surprised and delighted: \"Are you going there too?\"\n\nFeng Nü laughed: \"Yes! If I hadn't always kept my whereabouts a secret, people would definitely think you were intentionally following me.\" As she said this, she immediately realized her slip of the tongue, and her pretty face flushed crimson.\n\nNian Bing laughed heartily: \"You're so beautiful, there's nothing wrong with following you even if it was for you! So, let's go now. I don't have anything to pack anyway.\" Saying this, he walked up to Zi Meng: \"Dean, I think... I'm leaving.\"\n\nZi Meng smiled slightly, looking at Nian Bing, then at Feng Nü: \"Thank you for the delicious food you brought us today. It's a pity I don't know when I'll get to eat it again.\"\n\n\"No, you're not allowed to leave.\" It was Hei Ye who spoke; he had just wiped the soup from his mouth.\n\nNian Bing was startled: \"Teacher, I truly have something I need to leave for.\"\n\nHei Ye looked at him somewhat coldly, extending his right hand: \"You've been here for several months and haven't paid tuition yet. Pay the tuition first, then leave.\" As soon as he finished speaking, he couldn't help but chuckle himself.\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment, extended his right hand, and with a flash of light, a small box appeared in his hand. He handed it to Hei Ye, smiling: \"Teacher, thank you for your guidance all these days. Please accept this as my tuition fee.\"\n\nHei Ye saw that the box was lead, and a look of doubt immediately appeared in his eyes. He glanced at Nian Bing before taking the box. \"What is it?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly: \"It's naturally something worthy of your status. You'll know once you open it.\"\n\nHei Ye glanced at Nian Bing, then slowly opened the box. In an instant, the kitchen, which had just returned to normal after the disappearance of the three precious knives, was completely enveloped in golden light. That calm and harmonious aura, that sense of holiness, filled everyone's bodies. All eyes were drawn to the box in Hei Ye's hand.\n\nHei Ye stared in astonishment at the golden gem in the box. As a Magic Scholar, how could he not recognize it? \"Heavens! How many more good things do you have on you, kid? Such a pure Sacred Radiance Stone, and so large too; it's my first time seeing one this big. Where did you get it from?\"\n\nNian Bing said: \"I won this in a wager. Teacher, although you don't cultivate light-element magic, having it by your side will definitely make your magic cultivation twice as effective with half the effort.\"\n\nHei Ye gazed at the soft golden light, a fascinated expression in his eyes. He took a deep breath, re-covered the box, and placed it back into Nian Bing's hand: \"No, this is too precious for me. Compared to me, you need it more. My magic has already taken shape; at worst, I just won't be able to reach the Archmage realm. But you're different. Something like this, which stabilizes one's mind, is extremely useful to you. In the future, you should wear it often when cultivating. Coupled with the effect of your jade, you won't have to worry about the ice and fire being disobedient.\"\n\n\"Father, my brother and I are also going to Aolan City.\" Zi Qingmeng's voice suddenly rang out at this moment. Her expression was very calm now. Her purple eyes were like water, without the slightest emotional fluctuation.\n\nZi Xiu, who was standing nearby, said: \"Xiao Meng, what trouble are you stirring up? You've seen Nian Bing's culinary skills today; it's not time for you to graduate from your apprenticeship yet.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng shook her head: \"No, Second Uncle, I'm not going out to improve my culinary skills. My brother and I are going to join the army. This semester's classes will end in two days. My brother and I have had this plan for a long time. The nation's fate rests on every individual's shoulders. Our Aolan Empire's strength has been greatly damaged by the bullying of Huarong and Qilu. My brother and I want to do our part for the country.\"\n\nZi Xiu frowned: \"Our Zi family only has the two of you as descendants. If both of you go to the army, and something happens, who will provide for us in our old age and perform our funeral rites? No, I don't agree. It's too dangerous.\"\n\n\"Forget it, let them go. Young people should experience more, venture out. The outside world will bring them more experiences and training.\" Zi Meng's attitude was completely opposite to Zi Xiu's, and a benevolent look appeared in his eyes: \"You can go, but I don't want you to use your status as Lanmeng Academy students to make a statement. Since you're joining the army, you must start from the very bottom. Only by understanding soldiers of every rank will it be more helpful for your future. Do you understand what I mean?\"\n\nZi Qingjian said loudly: \"Dad, don't worry, my sister and I definitely won't disgrace Lanmeng Academy. Brother Nian Bing, let's travel together then. Please wait for us for a moment; we'll prepare some things and be right back.\"\n\nSince Zi Qingjian had said so, Nian Bing couldn't refuse. However, he felt a bit dissatisfied. The chance to be alone with Feng Nü, which he had finally gotten, was just thwarted like this. He was truly unwilling.\n\nFeng Nü glanced at Nian Bing with a faint smile, saying: \"It seems our journey will be quite lively.\"\n\nThe weather had already turned cold. Although the coldest month had passed, the biting wind still cut to the bone. The bare tree trunks along the grand avenue looked somewhat desolate. The fierce north wind blew, making everyone's clothes flap noisily. The sky today was somewhat gloomy; although it wasn't snowing, it gave a completely unpleasant feeling. This kind of gloomy weather most easily created a sense of oppression.\n\nAn hour ago, Nian Bing, Feng Nü, and the Zi Qingjian siblings bid farewell to Zi Meng, Zi Xiu, and Hei Ye, leaving the academy city of Lanmeng and embarking on the road to Aolan City. They had been walking for an hour, but none of the four had spoken. Although Nian Bing's stamina was somewhat inferior, Feng Nü and the other two did not use their martial skills to travel lightly, so while he was a little tired, he could still endure.\n\nIn the gloomy weather and oppressive atmosphere, it was surprisingly not the blunt and simple-minded Zi Qingjian who broke first. Ever since leaving the academy, Zi Qingjian would occasionally steal a glance at Feng Nü, walking with a troubled mind, unsure if it was due to a sense of loss from leaving his home or some other reason.\n\n\"Feng Nü, there's something I want to ask you.\" It was Nian Bing who spoke first again. Aside from the academy, he had been thinking the entire journey about how to deal with the Zi Qingjian siblings, and what was the best way to avoid traveling with them. He still had a good impression of Zi Qingjian, but the unpredictable Zi Qingmeng made him quite uncomfortable; Nian Bing had no fondness for ill-tempered girls.\n\nFeng Nü walked forward, saying: \"I knew you were going to ask. You guessed correctly; I did deceive you when we first met, but Senior Huatian can indeed be considered my teacher. I didn't lie about the cause of his death. As for anything else, please don't ask, okay? If the time is right, I will naturally tell you.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Feng Nü's calm expression and sighed inwardly, knowing that asking was useless. Feng Nü was roughly his age yet possessed strength close to a Martial Saint; this alone was far from simple. Especially since Zi Meng had once said she had the Nine-Separations Physique, what did that mean?\n\nFeng Nü seemed to sense Nian Bing's dissatisfaction. She turned to look at him and smiled faintly: \"Don't you also have secrets in your heart? I guess we're even, then?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly: \"If I were to trade my secret for yours, I wonder if you'd be willing?\"\n\nFeng Nü chuckled: \"Oh, please. I don't believe you'd be willing to reveal your own secret. On the surface, you look honest, but in reality, you're craftier than anyone. Who knows if you're just making up a story to deceive me?\"\n\nNian Bing feigned an aggrieved expression: \"You're wrong! Am I that kind of person?\"\n\nFeng Nü snorted: \"Aren't you? Leaving aside everything else, just those two items on you, the Ice Goddess Stone and the Fire God Stone, you probably can't explain clearly, can you?\"\n\nNian Bing was speechless. Indeed, these two gems were given to him by his parents, and they each represented a story, a story extremely closely related to him. \"Alright, I won't ask you anymore. However, your Nine-Separations Dou Qi, which completely surpasses Senior Huatian's, really strikes me as odd.\"\n\nFeng Nü glanced at Nian Bing: \"Simply put, Huatian's Nine-Separations Dou Qi was likely learned from my elder. The reason he taught me forging techniques and sacrificed himself to forge a sword was all to repay a favor. That's all I can say. I don't want you to misunderstand anything.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred. Connecting the events that had occurred previously, the thoughts in his mind suddenly became clearer. He smiled faintly and said: \"Feng Nü, Elder Brother Qingjian, let's rest up ahead for a bit.\"",

    "content": "Zi Qingjian looked up and glanced at Feng Nü. Feng Nü and Nian Bing were both looking at him at this moment, and a flush immediately rose on his bronze-colored face. He coughed once, \"Ah! Alright, let's rest for a while.\" Seeing his awkward demeanor, Nian Bing gave Feng Nü a strange look, while Feng Nü frowned. Zi Qingjian was simple and honest by nature, not good at concealing himself. They could all tell what the sturdy man was thinking. Even Zi Qingmeng, standing nearby, was somewhat displeased by her brother's state and nudged him with her hand, hoping to bring him back to his senses.\n\nThe four of them came to the edge of a forest not far ahead, facing the main road, and sat down. Ancient trees towered, but there was no shade at this time. On the bare tree trunks, one could occasionally hear the unpleasant caw of crows. A biting wind blew fiercely; the weather indeed was the coldest time of the year. Although Nian Bing did not know martial skills and his physical constitution was only average, he had ice and fire magic for protection. He only needed to activate the magic power within his body and release a second-tier Ice Body Technique* on himself to completely resist the cold.\n\nFeng Nü, however, directly ignored this level of cold.\n\nZi Qingjian was sturdy and his battle qi was refined, so this bit of cold was nothing to him. Only Zi Qingmeng, whose martial skills had not yet reached mastery**, and who cultivated wind-element battle qi, shivered from the biting cold wind.\n\nWhen they left the academy, they were all in a hurry. Zi Qingmeng had been in the academy, mostly in her room, and had been preoccupied when they left, so she only brought some simple clothes. By the time she realized the cold, it was too late. Even putting on a coat only slightly alleviated the invasion of the cold.\n\nZi Qingjian was deep in thought, head bowed. His face flushed and paled by turns, not noticing his sister's discomfort at all. Zi Qingmeng, being naturally proud, refused to ask her brother for help, and her complexion gradually changed in the cold.\n\nNian Bing sat between Feng Nü and the Zi Qingjian siblings. He had originally wanted to chat more with Feng Nü about the days they had been apart, but due to Zi Qingjian's demeanor, he found it difficult to say much. Accidentally seeing the change in Zi Qingmeng's complexion and her shivering body, he subconsciously asked, \"Miss Qingmeng, are you very cold?\"\n\nZi Qingmeng had been able to endure it along the way, but now that they had stopped, the cold wind easily pierced through her clothes, and she could no longer bear it. Hearing Nian Bing ask her, she felt a little grateful. She nodded. \"A little. A little cold.\"\n\nZi Qingjian heard their conversation and finally snapped out of his thoughts. He turned to look at his sister and was startled to find that Zi Qingmeng's lips were already somewhat blue. He immediately jumped up and quickly took off his outer coat to cover his sister. \"Xiao Meng, why didn't you tell me you were cold?\"\n\nZi Qingmeng huffed in annoyance, \"I don't need your clothes. You aren't wearing much yourself. Keep them for yourself.\"\n\nNian Bing was about to use magic to conjure a ball of fire to warm them up when Feng Nü suddenly stood up and walked to Zi Qingmeng's side. \"Sister Zi, enduring the cold like this is bad for your body. If it damages your meridians***, it could leave a lasting illness****.\"\n\nShe smiled, and the smile on her face naturally instilled a sense of trust. The initially jealous Zi Qingmeng, upon hearing Feng Nü's gentle and concerned voice, subtly underwent a change. Just as she was about to say something, Feng Nü's hand was already on her shoulder.\n\nA warm current flowed from Feng Nü's slender, fair jade-like hand***** into her body. The cold dissipated within the warm current. Zi Qingmeng even felt wisps of cold air emanating outwards from her body. The warmth, from within, expelled all the cold from her. Gradually, the warmth transformed into heat. No matter how the cold wind blew, it could no longer penetrate in the slightest. She felt warm and cozy, an indescribable comfort.\n\nLifting her hand, Feng Nü smiled slightly and said, \"There, my battle qi can keep you from feeling cold for at least an hour, and it has also completely expelled the cold evil energy****** that had invaded your body.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng stood up, gratefully holding Feng Nü's hand, and said, \"Thank you, Miss Feng Nü.\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled faintly, \"What is there to thank? We are all travelers on the same path; helping each other is only right.\"\n\n\"No, no, of course we must thank you, of course we must! I thank you on behalf of my sister. If there's ever anything you need my help with in the future, I'll definitely assist with all my might.\" Zi Qingjian also stood up, somewhat incoherently.\n\nNian Bing couldn't help but find it a little amusing. He wasn't worried about Zi Qingjian pursuing Feng Nü; he just found his silly demeanor quite endearing. \"Feng Nü, I'm cold too. Could you warm me up a bit?\"\n\nFeng Nü glanced at Nian Bing and said, \"Don't think I really don't understand magic. Don't even try it. Both ice magic and fire magic can effectively combat the cold.\"\n\nNian Bing gave an embarrassed smile and said, \"When I was cooking at the academy earlier, my magic power was almost depleted. How could I possibly resist the cold now?\"\n\nFeng Nü huffed, \"Then just use the Yang-Aligning Blade. Wear it on you, and you won't feel cold even without doing anything.\"\n\nSeeing that Feng Nü wasn't falling for it, Nian Bing smiled and shook his head, looking at her long pink hair, somewhat lost in thought.\n\nJust then, crisp hoofbeats echoed from one side of the road. The weather was cold, and Lanmeng City was a relatively remote city, so the nearby roads were sparsely populated. Hearing the sudden sound of hoofbeats, everyone couldn't help but turn to look. They saw more than ten riders rapidly approaching. Their mounts were clearly high-quality horses; although they galloped at a rapid pace, their hooves landed very lightly, not kicking up any dust. As they drew closer, one could vaguely see that these people were all wearing cold-weather cloaks, each of them spirited, their forms steady on horseback, their riding skills extremely refined.\n\n\"Oh?\" Nian Bing stood up, a little puzzled, and called out to the knights who were about to approach their group of four, \"President Carlo, is that you?\"\n\n\"Stop—\" The knight on the lead horse abruptly reined in, and the warhorse whinnied loudly, rising on its hind legs, stopping its gallop. The following knights were clearly well-trained, showing no panic, and stopped behind the lead knight.\n\n\"Ah! Nian Bing, it's you! What a coincidence!\" The lead knight jumped off his horse. It was indeed Carlo, president of the Ice Moon Empire Mercenary Guild. He wore black leather armor underneath, covered by a large cloak. A longsword was strapped to his back, and there was a golden moon emblem on the left chest of his cloak.\n\nNian Bing went up to him, smiling, \"Indeed! What a coincidence, President Carlo. Are you going on a mercenary mission?\"\n\nCarlo laughed heartily. He walked up to Nian Bing. \"An employer submitted a Class 1 mission at the guild. It's quite difficult for ordinary mercenary groups to complete, so I took it on. Here I am, taking my own mercenary group members to complete it. Why are you here? Last time I heard, weren't you going to Olan City?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"I was originally going to Olan City, but I was delayed by some matters, and now I'm just about to leave. I wonder if you've been to Ice Snow City yet?\"\n\nCarlo turned and made a gesture to the mercenaries on horseback. \"Let's go. Let's talk by the side. Don't block the road.\" The mercenaries dismounted one after another. One of them led Carlo's mount to the side of the road.\n\nCarlo saw Feng Nü and the other two, and a surprised glint appeared in his eyes. \"Nian Bing, are these your friends?\"\n\nNian Bing detected the doubt in Carlo's eyes. He knew Carlo was surprised because he had different women with him, but how could he explain that? He could only say, \"Yes, let me introduce you. This is Feng Nü, and these two are the siblings Zi Qingjian and Zi Qingmeng. Feng Nü, Brother Qingjian, Miss Qingmeng, this is President Carlo of the Ice Moon Empire Mercenary Guild.\"\n\nFeng Nü and the other two, and Carlo, nodded to each other. Nian Bing took the opportunity to glance at the mercenaries Carlo had brought. He was surprised to find that, except for the moon emblem on their chests being blue, their attire was identical to Carlo's. Each of them had a calm and composed demeanor, appearing to be in their thirties. They did not converse with each other, each leading their horses and resting by the roadside. Several mercenaries stood in strategic positions, serving as guards. From the subtle aura emanating from them, it was clear that these mercenaries' strength was even greater than that of the Silver Feather Knights members he had seen back then.\n\nCarlo pulled Nian Bing aside and said, somewhat gratefully, \"Nian Bing, thank you so much for last time. I've been to Ice Snow City and talked with President Long. We've reached a cooperation agreement and resolved the issues between our two guilds. Now, our Mercenary Guild has formed an alliance with your Ice Moon Empire Mage Guild.\"\n\n\"An alliance?\" Although Nian Bing had long thought that Long Zhi would choose to cooperate with the Mercenary Guild, an alliance was something he hadn't expected. After all, the Mage Guild was considered the highest-level guild on the continent, while the Mercenary Guild was a lower-tier guild. For Long Zhi to abandon prejudice and resolve to cooperate so closely with the Mercenary Guild was truly farsighted and indeed the best choice for the Mage Guild. \"President Carlo, could you elaborate a bit on what this alliance entails?\"\n\nCarlo smiled faintly, \"It includes every cooperation you can think of. Our Mercenary Guild will provide your esteemed guild with all necessary funds and resources, while your esteemed guild will provide us with the magic scrolls we need. Most valuable of all, twenty mages from your esteemed guild have joined my mercenary group. This has greatly enhanced the strength of our mercenary group. Truth be told, there's probably no other mercenary guild on the entire continent that possesses twenty mages, and all of them are Grand Mages or above, led by Archmage Lida. We originally weren't confident about completing this Class 1 mission, but with Archmage Lida and two other Grand Mages participating, I'm confident we can complete the mission. They went ahead by carriage, and we're just about to meet up with them. Nian Bing, President Long holds you in extremely high regard! What do you say? Interested in coming with us to complete this mercenary mission? Don't worry, the compensation won't be an issue.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"Let's just leave it at that. These friends and I still have to hurry on our journey. My absence won't have any impact on your mission.\"\n\nA trace of disappointment appeared on Carlo's face. \"That's truly a pity. Actually, it wouldn't delay you for too long. Our objective this time is a treasure. According to the employer, the treasure contains not only various riches but also some lost magic spells and martial skill secret manuals, all of which are rare and valuable items! If you're willing to come with us, considering your help to our guild, I can let you choose three items from it as compensation. How about it?\"\n\nGold and silver treasures couldn't move Nian Bing's heart, but the lost magic spells made his heart stir. According to Long Zhi, the reason the magic world gradually declined was precisely due to the loss of many ancient magic cultivation methods and powerful magic spells. If he could obtain some powerful magic spells he could use, it would naturally be of great benefit to his future revenge. Meeting Carlo's gaze, he asked, \"What are the employer's requirements then? Since there's such a great treasure, why doesn't he go looking for it himself, instead hiring you? Isn't he afraid you'll embezzle it*?\"\n\nCarlo's expression darkened slightly. He said, \"Nian Bing, you underestimate us too much. The Ice Moon Mercenary Group I established bears the name of the Empire and is the only Class 1 mercenary group in the Ice Moon Empire. Our reputation is our guarantee for continued development. Frankly, the reason the employer decided to hand over the map for us to complete the mission is because the map itself is incomplete. Moreover, according to what the map says, this treasure is a cursed treasure. The map he obtained is just one copy, and there are a total of twelve such copies. According to reliable information, others who obtained map copies have already organized people to search for the treasure, but none have returned alive. The danger of the treasure can only be imagined. That's why the employer would so easily hand over the map. One could say, this map is the compensation he provided. If we find the treasure and successfully transport all the precious items out, then the employer only wants one legendary bottle from the treasure; all other precious items will belong to our mercenary group.\"\n\n\"A legendary bottle?\" Nian Bing looked at Carlo in confusion.\n\nCarlo said, \"The employer is a mysterious middle-aged man. He only said there's a black bottle in the treasure, and he didn't really reveal its secret. As long as we give him that bottle, the mission will be considered complete. Besides what we obtain from the treasure, he will also pay us an additional ten thousand violet gold coins as compensation. I think that bottle might be a magical item. For this mission, I've brought all the elites from my mercenary group this time. What you see here is only a portion of them; the other portion includes three mages from your guild. On this expedition, our Ice Moon Mercenary Group has deployed a total of thirty-two Great Swordsman-level warriors, three Martial Artists including myself, plus three mages. Their strength, I believe, is unmatched by any other mercenary guild on the continent. So, I'm very confident we can complete the mission. What do you say, come with us?

    "content": "\"To say he wasn't tempted, that would be unrealistic. The thought of the ancient magic spells that might exist made Nianbing's heart burn with fervor. He nodded and said, \"I'll discuss it with my friends.\"\"\n\nCarlo took a leather pouch from his waist, opened it, and drank some water. \"Welcome to the team. I trust your friends.\"\n\nHe had an excellent impression of Nianbing. With Nianbing's help, his Ice Moon Mercenary Group formed an alliance with the Ice Moon Mage Guild, instantly transforming from the strongest mercenary group in the Ice Moon Empire into one of the few strongest mercenary groups on the entire continent. Nianbing had played a mediating role in this process. Therefore, Carlo had always wanted to repay Nianbing. Although this mission carried some risks, he believed that the strength he brought was already sufficient. The reason he invited Nianbing was to use this opportunity to give him some benefits, as a repayment, and also to win him over. Long Zhi had already hinted to him in a private conversation that Nianbing was his successor.\n\nTo ensure the continued cooperation between the two guilds, Carlo had long wanted to find an opportunity to see Nianbing again, but he hadn't expected the chance to come so quickly.\n\nNianbing walked over to Feng Nü and the other two, quietly describing the mission Carlo had mentioned. \"...So, what do you think? Are you interested? I reckon that with President Carlo leading such a large group of experts, the treasure certainly won't be bad. If you're unwilling to go, then we'll have to part ways here.\" Nianbing had already made up his mind to go with Carlo; the temptation of the magic spells was too great.\n\nA light flashed in Feng Nü's eyes. She said, \"I have no problem with that. I'm not in a hurry to get to Olan City; I still have some time. As long as it doesn't drag on for too long, it's fine. However, I have a condition: if we really find the treasure, I want to choose one item from it, though of course, not the bottle belonging to their mercenary group's employer.\"\n\nNianbing nodded, then turned his gaze to Zi Qingjian and his sister, saying, \"What about you two?\"\n\nZi Qingjian hesitated, looking at his sister. \"Xiaomeng, why don't you go back to the academy and wait for me? This sounds a bit dangerous, I'm afraid...\"\n\nZi Qingmeng snorted, saying, \"What's there to be afraid of? If you all can go, I can too. We left the academy for experience anyway, and this is a good opportunity!\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly. He said, \"Then it's no problem. We'll look out for each other when the time comes. With the strength of so many of us, there shouldn't be any issues.\" As Carlo had said, the Ice Moon Mercenary Group had deployed all its elites this time. Including himself, there were a total of four magic experts above the Great Mage level, plus Feng Nü, a quasi-Martial Saint. What difficulty could stop them?\n\nReturning to Carlo's side, Nianbing said, \"President Carlo, we've decided to participate in your operation. However, one of my friends has a request: if the treasure is found, she wants to choose one item as payment.\"\n\nCarlo frowned slightly. He said, \"Nianbing. This condition is a bit harsh. Although I am the leader of the Ice Moon Mercenary Group, this operation is very dangerous, and the potential gains could be huge. Agreeing to let you take three items is already the limit. I can pay your friends a certain amount of money. But choosing items, I'm afraid...\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly, \"President, there's no need to be troubled. Didn't you just say I could choose three items? How about this: I'll only choose two of them, and the remaining one will be picked by my friend. That way, there's no problem. However, I believe that if we encounter real danger, you will certainly see that this friend of mine has the ability to demand to choose one item.\" When Feng Nü proposed this condition, Nianbing didn't feel anything improper about it; after all, Feng Nü had sufficient strength to make such demands.\n\nCarlo looked at Nianbing with some surprise, then at Feng Nü, who held a long sword. He nodded and said, \"Let's do as you say. We'll decide the specific distribution when we truly obtain the treasure. Nuoqī, Hadeya, you two give up your horses and ride with others. Nianbing, I'll free up two horses for you. We'll buy some good horses when we reach the next city.\"\n\nNianbing nodded, \"Then let's set off now.\" Two mercenaries led their horses over to Nianbing. Nianbing couldn't help but feel a bit awkward. Logically, he should have ridden with Zi Qingjian, and Feng Nü with Zi Qingmeng, but when the four of them prepared to mount the horses, a problem arose. Nianbing was alright; though tall, he wasn't overly muscular. However, Zi Qingjian's physique was rarely seen in the world. With their combined bulk, riding a single horse together would be quite difficult. For a moment, they didn't know how to distribute themselves. The Ice Moon Mercenary Group had already given up two horses, and the reluctant expressions of the two mercenary warriors as they handed over their horses made Nianbing too embarrassed to ask them for another.\n\nZi Qingmeng suddenly spoke up. She generously walked up to Nianbing and said, \"I'll ride one with you, and my brother and Sister Feng Nü can ride the other. That should fit.\"\n\nNianbing froze for a moment. Looking up, he saw Zi Qingjian's eyes filled with excitement. Zi Qingjian had always treated him as a brother. Although Nianbing secretly wished to ride with Feng Nü, how could he say it at this moment? Zi Qingmeng voluntarily asking to ride with him was clearly to give her brother a chance to get close to Feng Nü. A strange feeling spread through Nianbing's heart, and for a moment, he couldn't speak.\n\nFeng Nü walked up to Nianbing and Zi Qingmeng, saying, \"Sister Qingmeng, can you ride a horse?\"\n\nZi Qingmeng froze for a moment, shaking her head. \"I can't. Although I've always studied in the Martial Arts Department, I've always had my attention divided, studying culinary arts at the same time, unlike my brother who has time to practice horsemanship. But I'll definitely learn it well in the future. Feng Nü, my brother's horsemanship is excellent, you can rest assured. You riding a horse with him will definitely not be a problem.\"\n\nFeng Nü let out a chuckle, saying, \"That probably won't work. You can't ride a horse, and Nianbing can't either. How will you keep up with the team?\"\n\nZi Qingmeng froze, her gaze turning to Nianbing. She said, \"You can't ride a horse? And you call yourself a man!\"\n\nNianbing gave a wry smile. \"Why must a man know how to ride a horse? There doesn't seem to be a clear connection, let alone, I'm a mage, not a warrior.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng was now in a pickle. \"What are we going to do then?\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled faintly. \"Never mind, Nianbing and I will ride one horse, and you and your brother can ride the other. That solves the problem. I've also learned some horsemanship, so taking Nianbing won't be much of an issue.\"\n\nNianbing was overjoyed inwardly, but on the surface, he calmly said, \"Then this is the only way. Feng Nü, I'll trouble you.\"\n\nFeng Nü turned and smiled. \"What trouble? Just be careful when the time comes. I ride horses very fast, you know.\"\n\nZi Qingjian stood there stunned. Even if Zi Qingmeng wanted to help him at that moment, she had no way. It was only because she herself couldn't ride a horse. She walked up to her brother and said, \"Let's mount up.\"\n\nZi Qingjian nodded glumly, pulled over a nearby mount, and with his eyes fixed on the ground, dropped onto its back. The moment he landed on its back, the steed suddenly let out a long whinny, rearing up on its hind legs. Immediately afterward, its front hooves landed, and it forcefully kicked its hind legs sideways, trying to throw Zi Qingjian off.\n\nZi Qingjian hadn't quite reacted when he first sat on the horse's back. Feeling the danger at that moment, he subconsciously pulled the reins, pressed his body against the horse, and green combat aura permeated his entire being. He clung to the horse's back like a leaf. No matter how the steed bucked and shook, it couldn't throw him off its back. This horse's antics were a bit ill-timed; Zi Qingjian was feeling quite down at the moment. He extended a large hand forward, his thick, powerful arm tightly cinching the steed's neck, and he roared in a deep voice, \"Behave yourself!\" His body, originally light as a leaf, suddenly became as heavy as a mountain. The steed let out a mournful whinny, its four legs hitting the ground, unable to perform its previous actions again.\n\nFeeling the steed gradually being conquered by him, Zi Qingjian loosened his arm and gestured to his sister. Zi Qingmeng leaped up, landing gracefully in front of him, leaning against Zi Qingjian's broad and sturdy chest.\n\n\"Good horsemanship!\" Carlo couldn't help but applaud from the side. At the same time, he met Nianbing's somewhat sharp gaze, shrugged his shoulders, and made no further gesture.\n\nNianbing felt a bit dissatisfied. It was clear that the two horses Carlo had his subordinates bring were well-trained, good horses. Besides their owners, it would be extremely difficult for anyone else to ride them. Clearly, he was testing his friends. Feng Nü's martial arts were good, but what about her horsemanship?\n\nJust as Nianbing was wondering, Feng Nü had already grasped the reins of the other horse. A strange scene unfolded: her movements were far from as agile as Zi Qingjian's, yet from the moment she took the reins until she balanced herself on the horse's back, the steed remained docile, offering no resistance whatsoever. Carlo and his subordinates widened their eyes. One must know, this horse was even more temperamental than the one Zi Qingjian rode.\n\nNianbing watched Carlo and his men's surprise. Although he had some doubts in his heart, he didn't ask further. When he walked up to the horse, he felt a bit awkward. The reins were in Feng Nü's hands, and the stirrups were also under her feet. How was he supposed to get on? He certainly didn't know the lightness technique of martial arts. Was he going to use Blizzard? If so, the horse probably wouldn't be able to withstand the magic's influence. Just then, a hand like white mutton-fat jade extended towards him. Feng Nü's voice rang out, \"Take my hand.\"\n\nThe voice, like music from the heavens, completely calmed Nianbing's heart. He eagerly grasped the warm, slender, jade-like hand. When he looked up, he saw Feng Nü looking at him too. Before he could utter a word of thanks, his body was already flying upwards under the influence of a gentle but strong force. Fortunately, Nianbing had experience flying with Blizzard, so he didn't cry out in surprise. When his whole body shook, he found himself already seated on the horse's back. Feng Nü's slender, delicate figure was right in front of him. \"Hold my waist and sit steady.\"\n\nSeeing Nianbing and the others mounted, Carlo waved his hand. The knights simultaneously mounted their horses, and the sound of hooves grew rapid. They galloped swiftly forward along the main road.\n\nAt this moment, Nianbing was the most excited. He distinctly felt his heartbeat quicken. His hands wrapped around Feng Nü's slender waist, a faint fragrance filled his nostrils, and his chest pressed close to Feng Nü's back. As they were now, Feng Nü seemed as if she were embraced in his arms. A warm sensation emanated from his front. There was not a trace of excess fat on Feng Nü's waist. Although separated by several layers of clothing, Nianbing could still clearly feel Feng Nü's elastic skin. A wonderful sensation spread throughout his body. Even though the horse had begun to gallop, Nianbing didn't notice; he was completely immersed in that captivating atmosphere.\n\nFeng Nü's feelings were even more intense than Nianbing's. Her entire back was pressed against Nianbing's body. The man's masculine vigor fearlessly permeated her body. Especially Nianbing's large hands, which emitted waves of heat that spread from her waist and abdomen into her body. Her face felt hot, and Feng Nü's heartbeat was definitely no slower than Nianbing's.\n\nThe cavalry continuously galloped. The originally bumpy horse's back had now become a paradise of enjoyment. Nianbing's arms tightened around Feng Nü. Subconsciously, he wished this stretch of road would never end.\n\nAt the very back of the group were Zi Qingjian and his sister. Zi Qingjian's powerful arms protected his sister in front of him, while he controlled the horse beneath him. His mood, however, was exceptionally low. He watched Nianbing and Feng Nü ahead, a complex expression continuously flickering in his eyes.\n\n\"Brother, don't think about it anymore.\" Zi Qingmeng's soft voice came from in front of him. Zi Qingjian's whole body trembled. \"Me? I wasn't thinking about anything.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng sighed faintly. \"Silly brother, the expression on your face is so obvious. Let alone me seeing it, Nianbing and Feng Nü noticed it long ago. Give up. Can't you see that the relationship between Feng Nü and Nianbing isn't something you can interfere with? Feng Nü is willing to ride the same horse as Nianbing, don't you understand?\"\n\nZi Qingjian froze for a moment. He said, \"That's because you and Nianbing can't ride horses! Sister, I... I actually didn't hope for anything.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng gave a wry smile. \"Silly brother, don't overthink it. You and Feng Nü are impossible. Nianbing is handsome and a Great Mage; you're quite inferior in all aspects. Don't let yourself fall too deep; you'll suffer more that way.\"\n\nZi Qingjian was silent for a while. He said, \"Sister, she's truly beautiful. The moment I first saw her, she was in my heart. Brother Nianbing is indeed stronger than me. If she chooses Nianbing, I will only bless them. I don't hope she'll like me; is it wrong for me to like her in my heart?\"\n\nZi Qingmeng was immediately speechless. She never imagined her brother would be so infatuated. While they were talking, changes were also occurring on Nianbing and Feng Nü's side.\n\nFeng Nü, who was controlling the galloping steed, suddenly let out a low cry, \"Nianbing, what are you doing?\"\n\nNianbing, in his stupor, was suddenly awakened by the burning sensation emanating from Feng Nü's back. Only then did he realize that a certain part of his lower body had reacted, pressing against the back of Feng Nü's arm. This discovery immediately embarrassed him greatly. He quickly shifted his body backward, \"Feng Nü, I... I didn't mean to.\"\n\nFeng Nü's voice trembled slightly. \"You... quickly make that thing go back.\" The stiffness behind her made her heart flutter. Strange sensations continuously assailed her entire body. Her quasi-Martial Saint strength was of no use at this moment; her delicate body had become somewhat numb and aching.",

    "content": "Nian Bing relaxed his arm around Feng Nü, wanting to move back further, but with such limited space overall, where could he hide? The more he wished for the little brother below to retreat, the harder that disobedient junior became. Waves of pleasure continuously swept through him from the friction against Feng Nü’s back and buttocks. At this moment, Nian Bing felt like he was going crazy, his muscles tensed all over. He lowered his head and urgently whispered into Feng Nü’s ear, “It, it won’t listen to me! Feng Nü, I really didn’t mean it, don’t misunderstand.”\n\nFeng Nü was so anxious she was almost in tears. Despite the cold weather, she felt a ball of fire burning in her heart. “You, can’t you think of something?!”\n\nNian Bing forced a bitter smile. “This, what can I do about this? Unless we stop and rest for a bit. Feng Nü, how about, how about you endure a bit longer? We should be able to rest after running for a while more.”\n\nFeng Nü jabbed her left elbow backward, hitting Nian Bing’s ribs, and said with slight anger, “How can I endure it, Nian Bing, you’re so terrible! I knew I shouldn’t have ridden the same horse as you.”\n\nNian Bing winced in pain, his focus shifting somewhat. “Feng Nü, I’m a normal man! Whose fault is it that you’re so attractive?”\n\nFeng Nü whispered, “Idiot, don’t you know ice magic? Use a little on yourself, and that thing wouldn’t go back in.” After saying this, her pretty face flushed red like an apple. Fortunately, everyone was riding forward at the moment, so no one noticed her embarrassment.\n\nNian Bing hesitated, then said, “But, that would hurt me. Feng Nü, how about this, let’s chat, talk more, and if my mind is distracted, it might get better.”\n\nFeng Nü took a deep breath, somewhat choked up as she said, “Nian Bing, I hate you so much. How am I supposed to face anyone after this!”\n\nNian Bing was startled. He hadn’t expected the usually strong-willed Feng Nü to cry. Immediately, as if splashed with cold water, his little brother below finally sounded the retreat*. It returned to its original position. Lowering his head, Nian Bing still had his arm around Feng Nü’s waist, but he tried to maintain some distance from her. Feng Nü cried because of his contact, what did that mean? His heart, which had become hot due to Feng Nü’s presence, gradually cooled. He murmured, “Feng Nü, I’m sorry. Once we reach our destination and rejoin the magicians, I’ll take a carriage. I promise the same thing won’t happen again.”\n\nWith the thing behind him having retreated, Feng Nü immediately recovered somewhat. Nian Bing’s flat tone made her feel a little strange. She raised a hand to wipe away her tears and whispered, “What’s the use of saying sorry? Sit properly, if you’re that far away, you’ll fall off when we turn. You, didn’t you say you wanted to chat? What should we talk about?”\n\nNian Bing’s heart stirred. He tightened his arm around Feng Nü’s slender waist again, smiling faintly. “Let’s talk about you. How did you cultivate your martial techniques? You’re surprisingly powerful, I really underestimated you before.”\n\nFeng Nü sighed softly. “Nothing in this world comes for free. My current abilities are certainly due to my innate physique, but they are also inseparable from years of cultivation. I don’t know who my parents are; several elders raised me. According to them, from the moment I was born, they soaked my body in various medicinal liquids to help me fully unleash my constitution and enhance my potential. From the age of three, with the help of those elders, I began cultivating battle qi. By the age of seven, I already possessed the abilities of a high-level warrior. In a way, I never had a childhood; my childhood was entirely spent in cultivation. I am nineteen years old this year. For nineteen years, I can say I’ve cultivated martial techniques.” As she spoke, a faint trace of sadness subtly emerged in her words.\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment, then said, “So, that means your special constitution must be the Nine-Parted Physique* that Dean Zi Meng mentioned?” At this point, his mind had settled down. Although Feng Nü’s allure still existed, reason had gained the upper hand. There would be no more of his previous loss of composure.\n\nFeng Nü’s delicate body trembled slightly. She whispered, “Nian Bing, I know you’re very intelligent, but it’s best not to guess wildly about some things. Knowing too much won’t do you any good, do you understand?”\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. “As long as you don’t tell anyone else, how will they know that I already know? To be able to cultivate such strength in you, the power behind you must be incredibly strong.”\n\nFeng Nü said, “Don’t talk about me, tell me about yourself. You once told me that your parents are both deceased and that your magic was self-taught. Can self-study really make someone an Archmage at such a young age? And you possess Ice and Fire of the Same Origin. I think the secrets you carry are no less than mine. Nian Bing, sometimes you give me the feeling of a simple big boy, but at other times, you’re like a somber sage, never letting your emotions show. Just now, that was the first time I truly felt you lose your composure.”\n\nNian Bing sighed. “Actually, I don’t have as many secrets as you imagine. In my heart, there is only hatred. Because of this hatred, I can give up many things. The vendetta for my parents is irreconcilable*. Now I have only two goals: one is to fulfill my master’s wish and glorify my culinary arts, and the other is to seek revenge. It’s just that my enemy is too powerful; even I don’t know when I’ll have the strength to contend with her.”\n\nFeng Nü said, “Perhaps I can help you. Who is your enemy?”\n\nThis was indeed a tempting offer. Feng Nü was already close to the Martial Saint realm. If she helped, the chances of revenge would be much greater. However, Nian Bing shook his head. “No, I must avenge myself. Feng Nü, thank you. Although my enemy is powerful, as long as I make unremitting efforts, I will one day be able to surpass her.”\n\nCarlo, who was ahead, suddenly slowed down and detached from the team. By the time the other knights passed, he was parallel to Nian Bing and Feng Nü’s shared horse. “Nian Bing, you’re a magician. Can you handle such a long period of riding?”\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. “It’s fine for now, no problem yet. Feng Nü’s horsemanship is excellent, and the horse runs very steadily. Guild Master Carlo, where exactly are we going this time?”\n\nCarlo said, “This time, we’re heading to the Heavenly Oscillation Mountain Range, six hundred kilometers from the Aolan Empire’s frontier city of Aolan City. According to the map, the treasure we’re looking for is there. After entering the mountain range, we’ll have to abandon our horses and walk. But don’t worry, I’ve made preparations. At that time, warriors will help you magicians navigate the mountain paths.”\n\nFeng Nü gave a light hum of surprise. She said, “The Heavenly Oscillation Mountain Range is located in the easternmost part of the Aolan Empire. Beyond it lies the Aolan Sea. One could say the Heavenly Oscillation Mountain Range is the Aolan Empire’s natural defense line to the east. No matter how turbulent the sea, it cannot breach these mountains stretching for hundreds of miles. Precisely because the Heavenly Oscillation Mountain Range is close to the sea, there’s no arable land behind the mountains. Therefore, the Heavenly Oscillation Mountain Range itself is extremely desolate and sparsely populated. If we go there to seek treasure, logistics and supplies will be an issue. Moreover, because the Heavenly Oscillation Mountain Range is not prioritized by the Aolan Empire, there are no roads within it at all. It’s overgrown with thorns and difficult to traverse. It seems this mission will be very challenging!”\n\nCarlo looked at Feng Nü with some surprise. “I didn’t expect you, young lady, to be so familiar with the continent’s geography. What you said is exactly the same as my investigation results. The situation within the Heavenly Oscillation Mountain Range is complex, with many dangers we don’t yet know about. Otherwise, this treasure wouldn’t be called the Cursed Treasure. However, you can rest assured about the supplies. Our guild has spent a great deal of money to purchase several advanced spatial magic items that can store a large amount of provisions, enough to last us for several months. Besides, the treasure’s location is in the northwest of the Heavenly Oscillation Mountain Range. The distance after entering the mountains isn’t too far. So, if everything goes smoothly, we might complete the mission successfully in half a month. If we encounter a crisis we can’t handle, the prepared supplies will also be enough for us to retreat from the mountains. Of course, I don’t hope for such a situation to occur. Overall, I am quite confident about this operation.”\n\n“I hope it goes as smoothly as you say. Regarding food preparation, I suggest you prepare more vegetables, rice, and seasonings. We can supplement our meat supply directly in the mountains. It would also be best to have some simple medicinal herbs, and of course, plenty of fresh water is essential. If we only have dry rations, everyone will have dietary deficiencies, and their combat effectiveness will be reduced. As for the medicinal herbs for invigorating circulation and fortifying the body, I can give you a list; you just need to buy according to it.” Carlo frowned slightly. “Nian Bing, I’m afraid that won’t work. We mercenaries aren’t as delicate as you magicians; we usually just prepare the simplest dry rations. If we bring all these things you mentioned, do we also need to bring a chef into the Heavenly Oscillation Mountain Range?” Nian Bing was young after all. Although Carlo admired him, at this moment he still felt Nian Bing’s demands were a bit excessive.\n\nFeng Nü smiled. “You don’t need to worry about that. Nian Bing is not only an outstanding magician, but also an excellent chef. The food he makes is the most delicious I’ve ever tasted.”\n\nCarlo was stunned for a moment. “A chef? This...”\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. “You don’t need to be troubled. Where are we stopping for the night tonight? You’ll understand what I mean then. You can rest assured that I will definitely not cause you any trouble.” As a top-tier chef, his demands for food were indeed very high. Unless he was engrossed in magic research to the extent of pouring all his energy into it, like when he was in the library, he usually tried to cook his own meals. Even for simple steamed rice, Nian Bing could make it taste completely different.\n\nCarlo said, “We’ll talk about it then. Before we enter the Heavenly Oscillation Mountain Range, our last supply point is Heavenly Oscillation City, the closest city to the mountains. Another group of people should already be there, preparing the way and getting some essential tools for our entry into the mountains. Once we arrive there, we’ll rest a bit and then we can directly enter the mountains. If we travel through the night today, we should reach Heavenly Oscillation City by midnight. Once it gets dark, we’ll first find a place to eat some dry rations, rest a bit, and then continue on our way. Nian Bing, speak up if you can’t hold on; arriving a little later is no big deal.”\n\nCarlo returned to the front of the team. His attitude made Nian Bing feel a few degrees more favorably towards this Mercenary Guild Master.\n\n“Nian Bing, things might not be that simple,” Feng Nü suddenly lowered her voice and said to Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing said calmly, “What? Is there a problem?”\n\nFeng Nü nodded. “The Heavenly Oscillation Mountain Range is indeed desolate, but going there carries great danger. To my knowledge, a peculiar race resides there.”\n\nNian Bing raised a brow. “A peculiar race?”\n\n“Yes. Their strength is formidable. If possible, I suggest you propose to Guild Master Carlo that it would be best to terminate this operation.”\n\nNian Bing forced a bitter smile. “That’s probably not possible. Guild Master Carlo has mobilized so many elites from the mercenary regiments; he’s clearly determined to complete this mission. At this point, who could convince him? Feng Nü, what kind of race is it that makes you take it so seriously?”\n\nFeng Nü sighed softly. “On the continent, humans are the dominant force, but there are also some secret races that exist. Although they rarely interact with humans and are completely self-centered, if humans infringe upon their interests, they will not hesitate to annihilate the invading humans. As for what kind of race it is, I cannot say. Perhaps, we should withdraw.”\n\nNian Bing said somewhat awkwardly, “But I’ve already promised Guild Master Carlo; withdrawing now isn’t likely. Perhaps the treasure we’re seeking has nothing to do with the race you mentioned?” He was becoming increasingly confused about Feng Nü’s true identity. But he understood that no matter how he asked, if Feng Nü didn’t want to say, she definitely wouldn’t.\n\nFeng Nü sighed softly. “Since that’s the case, I’ll go along with you then. I hope, as you said, that this operation has nothing to do with that race. After all, the Heavenly Oscillation Mountain Range is vast, and that race’s numbers aren’t large. Perhaps they don’t even live in the northwest. However, you must promise me: if we truly encounter that race, you must immediately leave with me, even if it means abandoning your companions. Otherwise, even I wouldn’t be sure I could save your life.”\n\nHearing Feng Nü speak so gravely, Nian Bing also hesitated, but recalling the ancient magic spell mentioned by Guild Master Carlo, he dispelled the thought of withdrawing. Although he had gained some understanding of Ice and Fire of the Same Origin, at present, he had no confidence that he could merge the two types of magic into one through his imagined cultivation method. The ancient magic spell, however, might greatly aid him in cultivating more profound magic. For the reward, he chose to take the risk.\n\n---\n*   **Sounded the retreat:** An adaptation of the Chinese idiom 鳴金收兵 (míng jīn shōu bīng), literally \"to beat gongs and retreat troops.\" It refers to signaling a withdrawal or cessation of action, often with a humorous or ironic tone in this context.\n*   **Nine-Parted Physique:** Refers to a special physical constitution, often implying unique innate abilities or suitability for certain cultivation paths in fantasy novels.\n*   **The vendetta for my parents is irreconcilable:** An adaptation of 父母之仇不共戴天 (fùmǔ zhī chóu bù gòng dài tiān), meaning \"the hatred for one's parents' murder is such that one cannot coexist with the killer under the same sky.\" It signifies an irreconcilable feud or bitter animosity.",

    "content": "Time gradually passed. In the biting cold wind, the sun slowly set, leaving a faint red glow in the sky. During this time, Feng Nu twice used her Nine-Divisions Dou Qi to help Zi Qingmeng ward off the cold, allowing her to persevere. Along the way, the Zi Qingjian siblings spoke little, especially Zi Qingjian, who was originally cheerful but now seemed somewhat dejected. Bingyue and Feng Nu both understood why he was like this, but no one spoke of it directly, to avoid awkwardness.\n\nAt first, due to Feng Nu's presence, Bingyue didn't feel much, but after two hours of riding, the bumps on the horseback gradually became unbearable for him. His bones felt as if they were coming loose, especially his hip bones, which felt incredibly awkward. At this point, his body was completely leaning against Feng Nu, hugging her waist tightly to reduce the strain on himself. Fortunately, his physical discomfort diverted his attention, preventing the previous awkwardness from reappearing. The faint, delicate fragrance emanating from Feng Nu was Bingyue's greatest motivation to endure. His head rested on Feng Nu's pink hair, inhaling the subtle scent and feeling Feng Nu's elastic, graceful body. Despite his physical discomfort, he still hoped this journey wouldn't end too soon.\n\n\"It's dark. Let's dismount and rest,\" Carlo's voice rang out from ahead. The horses slowed down, changing from a gallop to a trot. Led by Carlo, everyone arrived at a relatively flat slope and stopped. The warriors dismounted one after another; for them, who trained regularly, such a journey was nothing but easy.\n\n\"Hey, let go. Haven't you hugged enough?\" Feng Nu's voice sounded. Only then did Bingyue react, reluctantly releasing his hands from around Feng Nu's waist. A surge of hot air suddenly enveloped his body. Bingyue felt his body lighten, and his feet trembled slightly. He was already on the ground, with Feng Nu holding his hand.\n\nHis legs felt weak, and the aching sensation from his hip bones temporarily deprived Bingyue of the ability to walk. He forced himself to move his body, thinking to himself, \"Riding a horse really isn't a good job!\" Fortunately, he had a beautiful woman for company; otherwise, this journey would have been unbearable.\n\nThe Zi Qingjian siblings walked up to them. Although Zi Qingmeng also looked somewhat tired, she was in much better shape than Bingyue. After all, a mage's greatest weakness was their physical body.\n\nFeng Nu released Bingyue's hand, went behind him, and pressed a palm against his lower back. Immediately, a surge of scorching Nine-Divisions Dou Qi permeated his body. The energy flowed along his meridians, instantly circulating throughout Bingyue's entire being. The hot sensation was so comfortable that Bingyue almost groaned in pleasure. Most of his physical discomfort instantly vanished, and his whole body felt warm and incredibly comfortable.\n\nTurning to look at Feng Nu, although only two hours had passed, Bingyue clearly felt that his relationship with Feng Nu had grown much closer. \"Thank you, I feel much better.\"\n\nFeng Nu smiled slightly and said, \"What are you thanking me for? I wasn't trying to help you. If I don't adjust your physical condition to be better, how will you cook for me? Weren't you planning to show off your culinary skills to Guild Master Carlo? It might also make him agree to bring more ordinary food into the mountains.\"\n\nBingyue reached to take Feng Nu's hand, but she dodged him. Feng Nu glared at him, and Bingyue chuckled, \"Good thing, there's still some way to go.\" His meaning was obvious. Before reaching Tiandang City, he could still hug Feng Nu while riding for a while longer.\n\nFeng Nu sputtered angrily, \"Go make the food, quickly!\"\n\nBingyue laughed heartily and said, \"At your command, I guarantee I'll complete the mission.\" With that, he walked towards Guild Master Carlo.\n\nZi Qingjian said to Zi Qingmeng, \"Go help Bingyue. With so many people, he probably can't handle it by himself.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng glanced at her brother, knowing he hadn't given up on Feng Nu at all. She nodded and followed Bingyue.\n\nFeng Nu didn't avoid Zi Qingjian. She walked to a large rock nearby and sat down. Zi Qingjian followed her, took off his broadsword from his back and placed it aside, then took out a waterskin and offered it to Feng Nu, saying, \"Miss Feng, have some water.\"\n\nFeng Nu smiled and shook her head, saying, \"Brother Qingjian, you should rest too. I'm not thirsty. I need to save more room to enjoy Bingyue's food later!\"\n\nZi Qingjian sadly withdrew the waterskin, took a sip himself, and sat down beside her. \"Miss Feng Nu, how did you train your martial skills to be so powerful? I've also been practicing martial arts since I was young, but now I'm only a Great Swordsman.\"\n\nFeng Nu said, \"The cultivation of martial skills requires gradual progress. Perhaps it's because my cultivation method is more effective. For your age, reaching the Great Swordsman realm is already very impressive. Moreover, I can sense that your martial skills will reach the level of a Warrior in at most three years. Keep practicing diligently, and you will certainly achieve something.\"\n\nZi Qingjian looked at Feng Nu's captivating smile and couldn't help but be a little dazed. \"Miss Feng Nu, are we friends?\"\n\n\"Of course, we are already friends.\"\n\nZi Qingjian lowered his head and said, \"How did you and Bingyue meet? From the way you two are, you must be very familiar with each other.\"\n\nFeng Nu said, \"It's alright. Bingyue is a good person and cooks excellent food. We are also friends. Actually, we haven't known each other for very long, not even half a year yet.\"\n\n\"Not even half a year?\" A hint of excitement entered Zi Qingjian's voice.\n\nFeng Nu smiled indifferently and said, \"Although we've known each other for a short time, we both belong to the same kind of people. We both have goals we pursue and won't change them for anything else. He is like that, and so am I. Therefore, we can only be friends, just like I am with you.\" After glancing at Zi Qingjian with a meaningful look, she closed her cerulean eyes and said no more.\n\nZi Qingjian was stunned for a moment. Though straightforward, he wasn't stupid, so he naturally understood the meaning behind Feng Nu's words. However, he didn't retreat upon realizing the difficulty. Instead, a hopeful thought arose in his mind. He believed that perhaps it was precisely because Bingyue wouldn't entangle Feng Nu in any way that she was willing to be more intimate with him.\n\nWhile Zi Qingjian and Feng Nu chatted here, Bingyue, on his side, unleashed his nearly perfect culinary skills. When Carlo watched Bingyue wield the gleaming Heaven-Defying Blade, continuously conjuring various seasonings from his hand, turning the originally bland dry rations into delicious food over the campfire, he simply couldn't believe his eyes. Especially when Bingyue finally conjured a large pot and used condensed ice along with some seasonings to make a steaming pot of thick soup. He wholeheartedly supported Bingyue's idea of bringing all sorts of food ingredients on the upcoming expedition.\n\nA simple meal brought Bingyue much closer to the warriors of the mercenary group. He conquered their stomachs, and though he might not have conquered their hearts, he at least gained recognition from these formidable warriors.\n\nAfter the meal, everyone rested for a while before once again setting off on the road to Tiandang City. Naturally, Bingyue still rode with Feng Nu, skillfully wrapping his arms around her graceful, slender waist. What both amused and annoyed Feng Nu was that he used his body's inability to adapt to long-distance riding as an excuse, almost completely leaning his weight on her back, making their contact even more intimate. Bingyue had also decided to go all out; since he finally had a chance to take advantage, wouldn't it be a huge loss if he didn't go all the way? It would be hard to find such an opportunity again. With a beauty like Feng Nu, how could Bingyue not be tempted? Fortunately, he was more restrained this time, and the little brother down below^1 was still obedient, not \"raising the flag\"^2 again.\n\n\"Bingyue, can you sit up straight? Your body can't be that bad, can it? I already helped clear your meridians when we ate earlier,\" Feng Nu said, displeased.\n\n\"Ah! My apologies. I overexerted my spirit competing in culinary skills with Elder Zi Xiu today, and then rushed for most of the day; I'm exhausted. I'm a mage, you know! My body can't compare to you martial skill practitioners. Feng Nu, your Dou Qi is so strong. Just bear with me for a bit, I'm going to sleep now.\" Saying this, he even more outrageously rested his head directly on Feng Nu's shoulder, inhaling the faint fragrance from her hair. He was secretly delighted.\n\nFeng Nu was a mix of shame and anger. She wanted to break free from Bingyue but was afraid of making him fall. Furthermore, the constant warmth radiating from his body made Feng Nu's delicate body feel weak. She couldn't even use her Dou Qi on him. \"You scoundrel, get up, what kind of behavior is this?\"\n\nBingyue said lazily, \"Anyway, I've been hugging you for half the day. Most people probably already think our relationship isn't normal. Since it's already like this, just let me sleep for a bit. Feng Nu, you're a bit too thin, your shoulder is a bit hard...\"\n\n\"You, you rogue...\"\n\n\"Oh, how did you know my nickname?\"\n\n\"You, pervert...\"\n\n\"Oh, so you even know my full name now.\"\n\n\"I'm going to throw you off...\"\n\n\"Then no one will make delicious food for you.\"\n\n\"I'm angry...\"\n\n\"It's fine. When we reach Tiandang City, I'll make you a Qi-Regulating Soup to drink. I guarantee one sip will fix it.\"\n\nBingyue suppressed his laughter, feeling Feng Nu's rapid breathing. Waves of drowsiness washed over him. In his hazy state, he actually fell asleep. Having finally found a comfortable position, he naturally wouldn't change it.\n\nFeng Nu's feelings of shame and urgency gradually faded. As Bingyue's body was pressed closely against hers, she could clearly feel his breath, steady and deep. \"That scoundrel, he... he actually fell asleep on my shoulder.\" \"Huh, why does my shoulder feel cold?\" Turning her head, she angrily discovered that Bingyue had drooled a little on her shoulder. A cold gust of wind blew, and the chilling sensation came from that.\n\n\"Bingyue, I'm going to kill you!\" Feng Nu clenched the reins, her mind continuously devising ways to torment Bingyue. However, until they reached Tiandang City, she didn't carry out any of them. At that moment, although Feng Nu was furious because of Bingyue's drool, at the same time, she found that Bingyue's sleeping face gave her a special feeling. Asleep, his expression was very peaceful, with only a faint smile at the corner of his mouth, looking very content. At this moment, he showed no changes in personality, sleeping like a child. No matter what, Feng Nu couldn't bring herself to wake him.\n\n\"Ouch!\" A violent jolt and pain woke Bingyue from his sleep. He rubbed his eyes, looking around somewhat groggily. The surroundings were pitch black. Noisy sounds accompanied by the horses' snorts made his mind a little disoriented.\n\n\"Get up quickly, we've arrived,\" Feng Nu's voice sounded in his ear. Hearing this voice, Bingyue immediately felt much more at ease.\n\n\"Feng Nu, we arrived so quickly? I'm still sleepy. Let me use your shoulder as a pillow for a bit.\" Bingyue climbed up from the ground and went to find his comfortable pillow.\n\n\"Ah! So hot, Feng Nu, what are you doing?\" The sudden heat made Bingyue almost jump.\n\nFeng Nu leaned close to him, grabbed his lapel, and said viciously, \"Bingyue, I didn't realize you were so wicked. Hmph, just you wait.\"\n\nBingyue blinked, pretending not to understand, and said, \"Me? How am I wicked?\"\n\nFeng Nu pointed to the drool mark on her shoulder. \"See for yourself what you did yesterday!\"\n\nBingyue froze. Under the illumination of the red Dou Qi emanating from Feng Nu's hand, he vaguely saw a small wet mark on her shoulder. \"This... this couldn't be my...\"\n\nFeng Nu pinched his arm hard. \"Nonsense! If not you, then who? How are you going to compensate me?\"\n\nBingyue looked at Feng Nu awkwardly, thought for a moment, and said, \"How about this? Later, I'll sleep on your other shoulder for a bit, so the marks are symmetrical. I reckon it'll look better.\"\n\n\"You...\"\n\nBefore Feng Nu could erupt, Bingyue turned and ran. By now, his vision had somewhat recovered, and he realized they were at the entrance of an inn. Two lanterns in front of the inn cast a dim yellow light. Carlo was directing his subordinates to lead the horses into the courtyard and settle them.\n\n\"Guild Master Carlo, we reached Tianshang City so quickly!\" Bingyue ran up to him and greeted him.\n\nCarlo said, amused, \"With a beauty by your side, of course you'd feel it was fast. But your friend's riding skills are truly remarkable; even our wild horses are so docile with him. Bingyue, you're truly blessed with romantic encounters!^3 Strike while the iron's hot, don't let your youth go to waste, hehe.\"\n\nLooking at the inappropriate old man Carlo, Bingyue said somewhat awkwardly, \"Well, we'll talk about that later. Perhaps when we can defeat her, there might be a chance.\"\n\nJust then, a soft and pleasant voice came from the courtyard, \"Guild Master Carlo, you've arrived. Uncle Lied and I were worried you wouldn't make it today.\"\n\nBingyue's whole body trembled. This voice was too familiar to him. Before he could react, a graceful figure emerged from inside the inn's door. A white fox fur robe enveloped her captivating body, but from her somewhat pale, pretty face, it was evident she had lost much weight. It was Long Ling, daughter of Long Zhi, the Guild Master of the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild, known as the \"Gentle Maiden.\"\n\n\"Bingyue? You, is it really you?\" Long Ling's face looked even paler, her eyes reddened, and she stared blankly at Bingyue, her warm, soft lips trembling slightly.\n\n\"Ling'er, what's wrong with you?\" Seeing Long Ling's appearance, Bingyue's heart ached. He hurried forward and took her hand. He found that Long Ling's hand was very cold, chilling to the heart.\n\n---\n^1 The little brother down below: A euphemism for male genitalia.\n^2 Raising the flag: A euphemism for an erection.\n^3 Blessed with romantic encounters: An idiom meaning someone who is lucky with or frequently encounters beautiful women.",

    "content": "Long Ling's face flushed slightly. She forcefully pulled her hands from Nian Bing's palms, took a step back, and whispered, \"Mage Nianshui, men and women should keep their distance. Please don't do that.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment. He turned to Kalo, who was beside him, and asked, \"Is Ling'er also a mage participating in this operation?\"\n\nKalo nodded and said, \"Yes, Archmage Lidai brought Great Mage Long Ling and Great Mage Feng Yun to participate in this operation. You're all from the same guild, so you should cooperate more during the operation.\"\n\nLong Ling politely nodded to Kalo and said, \"Guild Master, rest assured, we will do our best to help you. It's late; I need to go rest.\" Having said that, she didn't even spare Nian Bing a glance, turning and walking into the courtyard.\n\nKalo looked at Nian Bing with a faint smile, \"Is there some misunderstanding between you and Miss Long Ling? Young man, you must not let excessive emotional entanglements dampen your drive.\"\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile and shook his head, but couldn't say anything. The knights who hadn't yet entered the courtyard looked at him with somewhat changed expressions.\n\n\"Another one. What a lecher.\" Zi Qingmeng bumped Nian Bing, then entered the courtyard.\n\nZi Qingjian sighed at Nian Bing, glanced back at Feng Nü, and followed his sister in.\n\nNian Bing gave a bitter laugh in his heart. *Who did I provoke? Why do I seem like a scoundrel who seduces and abandons in their eyes? What an injustice!*\n\nEveryone had already entered the courtyard. Only Feng Nü and Nian Bing remained at the entrance. Feng Nü walked to Nian Bing's side, stopped, and seeing his hesitant expression, chuckled softly, \"No need to explain anything. We're friends, and I choose to believe you.\"\n\nNian Bing felt a surge of joy. Finally, someone understood him. However, his excitement quickly turned into smoke, because Feng Nü then emphasized, \"We're *just* friends, though.\" Practicing the Nine Departures Battle Qi, she actually exuded a faint chill.\n\nNight fell, and the cold air permeated. Nian Bing felt a wave of helplessness in his heart. *I'll take it one step at a time. Anyway, I haven't done anything bad, so why care what others think? Silence is golden, silence is golden!*\n\nEarly the next morning. Kalo announced a day of rest, and a major pre-departure shopping spree commenced in Tiandang City. Nian Bing simply wrote a procurement list for food, and did not leave his room all day, fully entering a state of meditation.\n\nAs night fell, a knock on the door suddenly sounded. \"Nian Bing. Time for dinner.\" Zi Qingjian's deep voice rang from outside the door.\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath, awakening from his meditation. Feeling the abundant magic power within him, yesterday's events seemed to have passed. Whether it was Feng Nü or Long Ling, he couldn't let them affect his goals.\n\nOpening the door, Zi Qingjian walked in, full of vigor. \"Brother, you didn't eat lunch. What were you doing alone in your room? Come on. Let's go eat; it's ready. Guild Master Kalo will also explain some details of this operation.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"Brother Qingjian, you look good today!\"\n\nZi Qingjian chuckled, \"Joyful occasions always lift one's spirits. Today, I consulted Miss Feng Nü on many questions regarding combat skills and gained a lot. Miss Feng Nü's talent in martial arts truly far surpasses mine.\"\n\nNian Bing felt an inexplicable pang of bitterness in his heart, but quickly returned to normal. \"Then congratulations, Brother. Sparring more with people stronger than yourself is very beneficial for your own improvement.\"\n\nZi Qingjian closed the door with a backhand. Solemnly, he asked, \"Nian Bing, what exactly is your relationship with that girl from yesterday?\"\n\nNian Bing paused, his brow furrowing slightly as he said, \"Brother, that's my private business; I don't want to talk about it.\"\n\nZi Qingjian said, \"That girl looks very fragile, as if a gust of wind could blow her over. Moreover, I've seen her several times today, but I've never seen her smile. That cold feeling is full of sadness. Don't tell me this has nothing to do with you. Nian Bing, have you done anything to wrong her?\"\n\n\"Enough.\" A sharp light flashed in Nian Bing's eyes, making Zi Qingjian's entire body feel a chill. \"Brother Qingjian, I don't want to discuss this. I told you, this is my private business; please don't interfere. Let's go eat.\" Having said that, he walked around Zi Qingjian and opened the door to leave.\n\nZi Qingjian stood there, somewhat dazed. It was the first time he had seen Nian Bing lose his temper. In that instant, an extraordinarily powerful aura had burst from Nian Bing, making it feel as if Zi Qingjian, with his Great Swordsman strength, couldn't even catch his breath.\n\nDinner was held in the hotel's dining hall. Before Kalo arrived, his subordinates had already booked the entire inn. Apart from the hotel staff, everyone was from the Ice Moon Mercenary Group.\n\nDinner was very sumptuous, with chicken, duck, fish, and meat all available. Of course, these foods meant nothing in Nian Bing's eyes. When he arrived, the dishes were already laid out. Nian Bing looked around and immediately saw Lidai, Long Ling, and Great Mage Feng Yun sitting at a table. There was an empty seat next to Lidai; no need to ask, it was reserved for him. After all, he belonged to the Ice Moon Empire Mage Guild. Without hesitation, he strode to the empty seat, greeted the three, and then sat down.\n\nLong Ling's expression was calm. Just as Zi Qingjian had said, a faint aura of sadness emanated from her, and the coldness she exuded was entirely due to sorrow. Nian Bing sighed inwardly, *Ling'er, am I truly worth this from you?*\n\nLong Ling seemed not to have seen Nian Bing, her gaze still fixed forward. Lidai and Feng Yun both nodded to Nian Bing, but neither said anything. As intelligent as Nian Bing was, he naturally understood where his cold reception came from, and he didn't care. He sat there, waiting for dinner to begin, while looking around.\n\nFeng Nü and Zi Qingmeng were at a table not far from him. At this moment, Zi Qingjian had also walked in and sat next to Feng Nü. Nian Bing was very calm, not just his expression, but his heart was equally serene. He pondered his situation in his magic cultivation process, not at all dissatisfied by the current awkward atmosphere.\n\n\"Alright, everyone's here. Let's eat. This is our last dinner before departure. Tomorrow at dawn, we will enter the Tiandang Mountain Range. Horses and unnecessary items will be left at this inn. I've already paid for three months at this inn. If we can successfully complete the mission, we will definitely return within three months. For this mission, our Ice Moon Mercenary Group has truly sent out all our forces. We've also received strong support from the Empire Mage Guild. I have full confidence in completing this operation. However, there's one thing I must warn everyone in advance: although our strength is formidable, there are many unknown dangers in the Tiandang Mountain Range. If anyone, due to carelessness, drags everyone down, don't blame me for being merciless. Everything will prioritize the team's interests. I won't say more. Most of you are veterans of this mercenary group, and I trust you.\" Kalo's eyes gleamed with power as he looked at his subordinates, exuding a powerful aura.\n\nNian Bing glanced at Kalo and saw two middle-aged people, both in their forties, sitting beside him. The one on the left had a cold expression. The same mercenary leather armor looked surprisingly harmonious on him. Although time had taken its toll, one could still vaguely see his youthful charm. Unfortunately, his handsome face was marred by a deep scar on his left cheek. On the right was a woman, the only one in the entire Ice Moon Mercenary Group not wearing standard mercenary attire. A fiery red long dress looked utterly ill-fitting on her barrel-like figure. Her brown hair was messy, and her large, flat face like a pancake was piled with makeup. Even so, it couldn't hide the closely connected pockmarks on her face. With every slight movement of her massive body, a layer of powder flaked off. Looking at her, anyone's appetite would probably be diminished.\n\nSensing Nian Bing's gaze, the middle-aged man showed no reaction, but the \"barrel's\" eyes lit up. She forced a smile at Nian Bing, and several cracks immediately appeared in the makeup on her face. Her large, yellow teeth were uneven, making Nian Bing almost spit out the tea he had just sipped. He managed a strained smile and quickly averted his gaze elsewhere. All the hairs on his body were standing on end.\n\nFinally, dinner began. Nian Bing calmly ate the dishes in front of him. With his previous experience, he dared not look around carelessly. Just then, Kalo walked up to him and smiled, \"Nian Bing, come with me. I'll introduce you to our mercenary group's two vice-commanders.\"\n\nNian Bing felt a bitter laugh in his heart. No need to guess, he already knew who the vice-commanders were. Led by Kalo, Nian Bing followed him to Kalo's table. Kalo pointed at the middle-aged man Nian Bing had seen earlier and said, \"This is Gatling, the vice-commander of our Ice Moon Mercenary Group. His combat skills are exquisite, far stronger than mine.\"\n\nGatling's gaze met Nian Bing's, and he concisely uttered two words, \"Hello.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"Hello, I am Nian Bing.\"\n\n\"Go, go, go, Gatling, move aside. Don't interfere with my self-introduction.\" The pungent aroma almost made Nian Bing faint. Gatling was pushed aside by the \"barrel,\" yet his face showed no change in expression. The \"barrel\" chuckled. Her height was actually similar to Nian Bing's, but her figure could fit four Nian Bings. Standing there, she was like a wall, likely weighing more than Zi Qingjian. \"Hello, little brother Nian Bing, my name is Huarui. You can call me Ruirui. I'm also a vice-commander of the Ice Moon Mercenary Group. We should get to know each other better in the future!\"\n\nWhen Nian Bing heard the name \"Ruirui,\" a chill ran down his spine. *If Huarui looks like you, there probably won't be any flowers left on the continent.* \"Hello, Miss Huarui, it's nice to meet you.\"\n\nHearing Nian Bing call her \"Miss,\" Huarui was immediately overjoyed. \"Hehe, little brother Nian Bing, you really have good judgment! You can tell right away that I'm still a maiden. I'm still unmarried, you know.\" As she spoke, she continuously batted her eyelashes at Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing lowered his head, thinking to himself, *It's not your fault you're ugly, but it is your fault for coming out and scaring people.*\n\nKalo naturally saw Nian Bing's discomfort and quickly said, \"Alright, everyone, let's eat.\"\n\nWhen he returned to his seat, Nian Bing had lost all appetite. Just then, Lidai, who was beside him, suddenly asked, \"Nian Bing, I heard Guild Master Kalo say you met them on the road. What do those people who came with you do?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"They are all my friends, and also martial artists.\"\n\nLidai's gaze swept towards Feng Nü's side. \"Is that girl your girlfriend?\"\n\nNian Bing suddenly felt a wave of irritation in his heart. *Why is it that the more I want to avoid emotional entanglements, the more new troubles arise?* \"No, she's just a regular friend of mine. You all eat. I've lost my appetite, I'm leaving.\" Having said that, he rose and left without waiting for Lidai to say more. As he departed, Long Ling's gaze finally swept over him once.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing leave, Kalo wanted to chase after him, but considering the many people in the dining hall, he could only shake his head helplessly.\n\nBack in his room, Nian Bing sat back on the bed, closed his eyes, and re-entered the realm of meditation. Since he had already left the Ice Moon Empire, he no longer had many inhibitions. Holding the Sigh of the Ice Goddess in one hand and the Roar of the Fire God in the other, he rapidly gathered the ice and fire magical elements from the air, concentrating them towards himself.\n\nThe growth of magic power offered no shortcuts. Only through continuous cultivation, making one's own magic power more massive, could one improve one's strength. The stronger one's magic power, the more the magic power in the air would be influenced when using spells. This was why there was a huge difference in strength even between mages just one level apart.\n\nThrough his research into magic over these days and the guidance of the Dark Night Archmage, Nian Bing had now changed his meditation method. Instead of absorbing magical power from the air through every part of his body as before, he now completely absorbed the magical elements from the air through his two peerless treasured blades. After being filtered and amplified by the Stone of the Ice Goddess and the Stone of the Fire God, they were then transmitted into his body through the palms of his hands. This method had several advantages. First, through the filtration of the two supreme gems, the inherent instability of the magical elements was well suppressed. Furthermore, as the magical elements passed through the two gems, they became denser and purer, saving Nian Bing the effort of controlling the magical power entering his body. Second, by absorbing through two points, it could better achieve a balancing effect when injecting into the Ice and Fire Co-source Vortex within his body, and also accelerate the vortex's rotation speed during meditation.\n\nAfter using this meditation method, Nian Bing clearly felt that his magic progress rate had increased significantly. One night's time was equivalent to four or five days of cultivation in the past. He deeply believed that as long as he persevered, he would definitely be able to enter the realm of an Archmage soon. The moment his two types of magic power were full, that would also be the time for him to seek new breakthroughs.",

    "content": "He didn't know how much time had passed.\n\nNian Bing, who was in meditation, suddenly heard a knock at the door. His spiritual power quickly controlled itself, no longer receiving external magic power, and he awoke.\n\n\"Who is it!\" It was already deep into the night. Night fog permeated outside the window. Nian Bing stood up, first drew the curtains, and then walked towards the door.\n\n\"Open the door quickly, it's me.\" A beautiful and melodious voice sounded from outside the door. Nian Bing's heart stirred; it was Feng Nü who had come.\n\nHe opened the door, only to see Feng Nü quietly standing at the doorway, smiling as she looked at him.\n\n\"Why are you here so late?\" Nian Bing asked, surprised.\n\nFeng Nü smiled slightly, \"What, aren't you going to invite me in?\"\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile, \"No need, right? It's so late, what would a young lady like you be doing in my room?\"\n\nFeng Nü snorted, saying, \"Rumors fade before the wise. I'm not afraid, so what are you afraid of?\" As she spoke, she pushed Nian Bing aside and walked directly into his room.\n\nNian Bing helplessly closed the door. He saw Feng Nü walk to the table and place a small cloth bag on it. \"Eat quickly. You didn't eat anything tonight. Are you angry? What did that magician tell you?\"\n\nNian Bing looked at the pastries piled in the opened cloth bag, and a warmth spread in his heart. He walked a few steps to Feng Nü's side, and in his emotional agitation, reached out to hug her. \"Thank you, Feng Nü.\"\n\nHer figure flashed, and Feng Nü, her pretty face slightly red, moved to the side. \"Don't be so handsy. Eat quickly.\"\n\nNian Bing somewhat awkwardly redirected his outstretched hand towards the table. He picked up a pastry and put it into his mouth. Feng Nü sat down in a nearby chair, watching Nian Bing with interest.\n\nAs Nian Bing ate the pastry, he said, \"Feng Nü, don't you want to ask what the relationship between Ling'er and me is?\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled and shook her head, saying, \"That's your own private business. If you want to tell me, you naturally will. Otherwise, what's the point of me asking?\"\n\nNian Bing sighed softly, saying, \"Actually, there's nothing wrong with telling you. I met Ling'er after I met you...\" He then simply recounted how he met Ling'er and how he joined the Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild. By the time he finished speaking, all the pastries Feng Nü brought had found their way into his stomach.\n\n\"So, you're quite charming, aren't you? That Miss Ling'er is very beautiful. Why don't you consider her?\" Feng Nü still smiled.\n\nNian Bing said crossly, \"Well, I'm quite handsome too, do you want to consider me?\"\n\nFeng Nü's pretty face flushed, and she said, \"That's impossible. We are people from two different worlds.\"\n\nNian Bing sighed softly, saying, \"I've rejected two girls. Actually, they are both excellent. To have one of them as a wife would already be fortunate for me. But I can't! I want revenge. And my enemies are so powerful. I also need to fulfill my master's wish. My heart simply can't settle down so quickly, so I can only choose to refuse. I don't want to implicate them either. Before I get my revenge, romance is a luxury for me.\"\n\nFeng Nü nodded, saying, \"I understand. Perhaps you are right, because like you, I also don't have the right to talk about romance. However, girls are most sensitive when it comes to feelings. Since you can't have a future with someone, don't tease them, lest more misunderstandings arise. Do you know, when you're concentrating on cooking, you're the most attractive?\"\n\nNian Bing laughed, \"Then did I attract you?\"\n\nFeng Nü said exasperatedly, \"Attract my foot!^1 I haven't even settled the score with you yet; you owe me a new outfit.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes sparkled. \"Alright, I'll compensate you. But I don't have money. How about this: I'll cook delicious food for you for the rest of your life as compensation, how's that?\"\n\nFeng Nü snorted, \"Then you can be my servant. I just reminded you not to casually tease girls, and here you go again.\"\n\nNian Bing laughed, \"That's because I know you won't fall for it! It's late; you should go back and rest early. Otherwise, I might really act like a hooligan, you know. With a beauty like you in front of me, my willpower isn't that strong.\"\n\nFeng Nü provocatively curled her lip. \"Aren't you afraid I'll beat you black and blue? Don't forget, your strength isn't enough to force me.\"\n\nA divine light flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. \"You also shouldn't forget that I am a magician. Although my overall strength is not as great as yours, if you give me a chance, I have a seventy percent certainty I can restrain you.\"\n\nFeng Nü was momentarily stunned. \"I want to try.\" Nian Bing's confidence piqued her curiosity. After all, Dou Qi was one of the best ways to break through magic. She knew clearly that Nian Bing's magic power couldn't compare to her Nine Departures Dou Qi, but he spoke with such certainty that it made Feng Nü somewhat puzzled. Her understanding of magic wasn't deep, but her desire for strength was absolutely no less than Nian Bing's.\n\nNian Bing gave a strange smile. \"Do you really want to try? If I restrain you, I can't guarantee I won't do anything improper, you know.\"\n\nFeng Nü said confidently, \"I don't believe you. How about we make a bet?\"\n\nNian Bing's boldness surged. \"Alright, tell me what you want to bet, I accept.\"\n\nFeng Nü thought for a moment, then said, \"I'll give you a chance to cast a spell. I absolutely will not interrupt your incantation. If your magic can restrain me, then what happened last night will be written off. Otherwise, you'll have to agree to three conditions from me in the future.\"\n\nNian Bing laughed, \"You're quite the schemer, but in that case, you'd be taking too much advantage. If I successfully restrain you, you'll owe me the kiss you promised last time. If I lose, I'll agree to your three conditions.\" Feng Nü looked at Nian Bing somewhat surprised. \"Are you really so confident? Do you really want to bet?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"Even agreeing to your three conditions is nothing. What, are you regretting it?\"\n\nA sharp light flashed in Feng Nü's eyes. \"Alright, I'll bet with you. Where should we do it?\"\n\nNian Bing pointed to the ground, saying, \"Right here in my room is fine. You want me to cast a spell, right? Then sit down first. I'll start preparing. Don't worry, I'll definitely warn you before I activate the magic.\"\n\nFeng Nü nodded and sat down to the side, but her gaze was fixed on Nian Bing, waiting for his move.\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment, then chanted an incantation, casting a Blizzard spell on himself. With astonishing magic control, he confined the Blizzard to an extremely small area, floating in mid-air, facing the ground. With a flick of his hands, the Morning Dew Blade and Positive Yang Blade appeared in his respective hands. Under the influence of magic power, the entire room was filled with red and blue light. Without any hesitation, Nian Bing's hands moved simultaneously, each blade transforming into a blur of light as they slashed towards the ground.\n\n\"A magic array? You can also use magic arrays?\" Feng Nü looked at Nian Bing in surprise, her initial confidence somewhat diminished.\n\nNian Bing didn't answer. His mind was entirely focused on the two blades in his hands. Amidst the flashing blade lights, two equilateral triangles, one blue and one red, appeared on the ground. They precisely intertwined to form a magical hexagram, red and blue interwoven, radiating a vast magical aura. Nian Bing did not stop his movements. He drew two circles outside the hexagram, then swiftly inscribed various complex symbols within the circles and the hexagram. Although his movements were fast, there wasn't a single flaw. With each additional symbol on the complex magic array, the aura it emitted grew a bit stronger. Strangely, although the magic aura was intense, it was confined within the magic array. Feng Nü, standing outside the array, could tell that this magic array was extraordinary, but she couldn't feel its true power. Her heart tightened, and she quietly mobilized her Nine Departures Dou Qi, keeping herself in optimal condition.\n\nThe time was much longer than expected. Sweat continuously dripped from Nian Bing's forehead, but it was quickly swallowed by the red aura within the magic array. Nian Bing's face had grown somewhat pale. The light emitted by the two peerless divine blades was no longer as intense as it was initially, clearly indicating that a large amount of his magic power was being consumed during the construction of this magic array.\n\nSuddenly, Nian Bing murmured a few incantations, and his eyes shone brightly. The magic power that had been greatly weakened suddenly surged. The two blades flashed several times in succession, and the halo of the magic array on the ground soared into the air. The next moment, everything suddenly vanished. The magic array on the ground completely lost its luster; only the marks left by the blades could be seen.\n\nNian Bing gasped for air, put away his two blades, and sat down on the bed nearby. Although he looked extremely tired, he appeared highly excited mentally, his eyes sparkling. He seemed even more thrilled than when he completed the carving of the Nine Dragons to Venerable Cauldron that day. \"It actually worked! This is amazing, truly wonderful.\"\n\nFeng Nü asked, puzzled, \"Nian Bing, what's wrong with you? Didn't you say you were going to restrain me? What kind of magic array did you just draw?\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, saying, \"You'll know if you try. I'll use this magic array. All you have to do is walk to the center of the magic array. If nothing happens, I lose.\"\n\nFeng Nü stood up, half-believing, half-doubting. She took a deep breath, and her entire body was instantly covered by a faint red glow. Her eyes shifted, trying to discern something from Nian Bing's expression, but Nian Bing only smiled, showing no special indication.\n\nFeng Nü floated forward. Although she was very curious about this magic array and didn't believe it could trap her, she still didn't take any chances. She raised her Dou Qi to eighty percent before landing on the magic array.\n\nSuddenly, a massive suction force emanated from the ground. Feng Nü was startled and quickly urged her Dou Qi to surge downwards, trying to break free from the magic array. However, it would have been better if she hadn't activated her Dou Qi. As soon as she did, she was shocked to discover that her Dou Qi poured out as if it had found a huge drain, flowing away through her feet.\n\nThe magic array on the ground glowed brightly, primarily red, instantly enveloping Feng Nü's entire body. An unusually immense suction force continuously eroded her body, and her Dou Qi rapidly disappeared at an astonishing speed under the influence of the strange suction.\n\nFeng Nü was somewhat panicked. Although she was brave due to her skill, she couldn't help but feel fear. After all, her Nine Departures Dou Qi was painstakingly cultivated since childhood, and it was only with the full assistance of her elders that she achieved her current accomplishments. If things continued like this, her Dou Qi would completely disappear. Wouldn't all her years of cultivation be in vain then? Thinking of this, Feng Nü's delicate body trembled slightly. She desperately tried to raise her Dou Qi to the Saint Dou Qi realm to escape this peculiar magic array. However, her Dou Qi was already too depleted; over-activating it would only make the Dou Qi be absorbed faster by the magic array. The red and blue lights, like a bottomless abyss, continuously devoured it.\n\n\"Nian Bing, what exactly have you done? Let me go quickly, my Dou Qi is about to...\" A feeling of weakness spread as her Dou Qi rapidly vanished. Feng Nü looked at Nian Bing somewhat pleadingly. She believed Nian Bing wouldn't harm her, but everything currently happening had gone beyond her imagination.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, saying, \"So, you're admitting defeat?\"\n\nFeng Nü opened her mouth, just about to say something, when the last trace of Dou Qi in her body was also drained. Her whole body went limp, and she immediately collapsed onto the magic array.\n\nNian Bing chuckled and walked inside the magic array. The magic array, which even Feng Nü, who was close to the Martial Saint realm, couldn't resist, had no effect on him at all. He picked up Feng Nü and let her lean against his shoulder. \"Now you should know that magic is a very peculiar ability, right? Although my magic isn't as powerful as your martial arts, in certain special circumstances, I do have the possibility of subduing you. This magic array is a special ancient formation that has been passed down. I originally only wanted to try it out, but I didn't expect it to actually succeed.\"\n\nTears streamed down Feng Nü's face. She said somewhat dazedly, \"My, my Dou Qi, my Dou Qi.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"Silly girl, I will return your Dou Qi. But, before that, I need to collect my winnings from the bet. Otherwise, once you recover, I won't be able to contend with you.\" As he spoke, he held Feng Nü's elastic, delicate body tightly and lowered his head towards her.\n\nUpon hearing Nian Bing say her Dou Qi could be restored, Feng Nü was immediately overjoyed. Before her mind could fully recover, a masculine aura was continuously approaching her. At this moment, she was so weak she couldn't even move a finger, let alone resist. Her pretty face instantly flushed crimson, and she subconsciously closed her eyes, waiting for the lips that were about to come.\n\nAfter a long time, although the masculine aura was still strong, the kiss she expected didn't arrive. She strangely opened her eyes, only to be surprised to find Nian Bing right in front of her, his face only three inches from hers, his breathing audible.\n\nNian Bing seemed to shake his head, a little troubled. \"Never mind. If you're not willing to let me kiss you, how could I force you?\" As he spoke, he murmured a few incantations, and the magic array immediately began to change. A rich red light, like all rivers flowing into the sea, surged towards Feng Nü's body. Feng Nü felt her whole body tremble. Her familiar Dou Qi was returning from every corner of her body, and the feeling of power gradually grew stronger. Her body trembled slightly with excitement; the sensation of her Dou Qi recovering was so wondrous.\n***\n^1 An idiom used to express strong dismissal or disagreement, similar to \"You wish!\" or \"Not at all!\"",

    "content": "Nianbing held Feng Nü, feeling the changes in the magic array. Everything was as he had judged. Such a powerful magic array, apart from being slightly difficult to set up, had almost no flaws and was completely within his control.\n\nThe recovery of her battle qi was even faster than its loss. When Feng Nü returned to her optimal state, she seemed to have forgotten her Martial Saint strength, still letting Nianbing hold her in his arms, still and obedient like a kitten.\n\nNianbing carried Feng Nü out of the magic array. \"Isn't my embrace warm?\"\n\nA red figure flashed, and Feng Nü broke free from Nianbing's embrace, scolding him lightly, \"You only know how to take advantage of me.\"\n\nNianbing chuckled, \"Well, now that I've won, shouldn't you let me kiss you?\"\n\nFeng Nü looked at Nianbing strangely. \"Then why didn't you kiss me just now? Since you didn't seize the opportunity, it means you gave up yourself. Nianbing, what exactly is this magic array? How can there be no chance to resist?\"\n\nNianbing looked at the complex patterns on the ground, murmuring, \"This is a very special magic array, passed down from antiquity. When I first saw it in the Ice Moon Empire's Mages' Guild library, I thought it was impossible to construct successfully, because it's simply too complex, and there can't be even the slightest flaw. Some parts are contradictory, and the interweaving of magic symbols also presents significant problems. However, later I suddenly realized that if it were drawn with one hand, this magic array would indeed be impossible to complete, but if both hands were used simultaneously, it might be possible. So, I considered completing this magic array based on the principle of ice and fire of the same origin. I had theoretically deliberated countless times before, and today was my first practical attempt. I didn't expect it to succeed so easily.\" He paused here, his gaze falling somewhat obsessively on the magic array. \"Feng Nü, do you know what this ancient magic array is called? It's called Illusory Space. Once this space is formed, I am the master of the space and can perform two types of transformations: one is release, and one is absorption.\"\n\nFeng Nü said, somewhat puzzled, \"Can you explain it more clearly? What is release, and what is absorption?\"\n\nA wise light flickered in Nianbing's eyes. \"Simply put, this magic array, in ancient times, was specifically used for sealing. Because it's extremely difficult to draw, very few people could truly use it. Once the magic array is complete, it will absorb external magic elements to replenish itself, and the intake and release of its own energy are entirely controlled by me. To put it simply, if I myself release magic within the magic array, the power of the magic can increase by at least 30% or more. If someone else steps into this magic array, you experienced what happened just now; it can completely devour all your energy. However, such a possibility is ultimately small, because anyone can feel the aura emanating from this magic array. If we weren't betting, would you easily step into this magic array? Therefore, the greater function of this magic array is as an amplification magic array for myself.\"\n\nFeng Nü asked doubtfully, \"I still don't understand. I cultivate battle qi, not magic. Why can it absorb my battle qi, and then return it later?\"\n\nNianbing smiled. \"All forms of energy in the world are conserved by nature. Although magic and battle qi are two different forms of energy, they are both energy nonetheless. For example, my Fire-elemental magic and your Nine-Departure Battle Qi share a common characteristic: fire. And my magic array is based on ice and fire, which is why it can exert its maximum effect on you. After absorbing your battle qi, you didn't truly lose it; you were merely affected by the Illusory Space's weakening effect, making you feel as if you had lost your battle qi. In reality, the Illusory Space merely drew out the battle qi from your body and completely isolated your body from external aura, creating that illusion. Once you leave the magic array, even if I don't help you, your battle qi will automatically recover within half an hour.\"\n\nFeng Nü thought for a moment, then said, \"So, with this magic array, your strength will greatly increase? Humph, I'll only fall for it this one time. You won't have another chance in the future.\"\n\nNianbing smiled indifferently. \"One chance is enough. You're my friend; if it were an enemy, they probably wouldn't escape so easily. However, this magic array also has considerable flaws. Not only does it take a very long time to draw, and the chance of failure is high, but it also consumes over 90% of my magic power. Therefore, it can't be used normally.\"\n\nFeng Nü laughed, \"That's not simple? Just dig up the floor in this room and put it into a magic item with storage space capabilities.\"\n\nNianbing chuckled, \"How could it be that easy? Once a magic array is formed, it absolutely cannot be moved. Otherwise, not only will it lose its original effect, but there's also the possibility of a magic explosion. When I was learning this magic array, I once thought that using it to defend a city would be the best method. As for other uses, its effect isn't very significant, unless my magic power becomes strong enough to easily draw this array.\"\n\nFeng Nü glared at Nianbing. \"You just used this broken array to take my battle qi; I'm not convinced I lost. But, I won't go back on my word.\" With a flash of a figure, Nianbing only felt a fragrant breeze hit his face, and his lips were covered by a warm, delicate scent. Just as he tried to grasp this wonderfully beautiful sensation, the warmth had already vanished. The door was open, Feng Nü had already left, and only Nianbing remained in the entire room.\n\nLooking at the open door, Nianbing shook his head with a bitter smile. \"Feng Nü, ah, Feng Nü, do you know? The longer I spend with you, the more I feel an uncontrollable impulse.\"\n\nA winter morning was the coldest time of the day. Waking from meditation, and with the help of the array he had drawn last night, Nianbing's magic power had completely recovered. He opened the window, and a chill assaulted his face. His exhaled breath turned into faint white mist that dispersed with the cold wind—what truly cold weather! Although he possessed two types of magic, as a mage, he was still somewhat unaccustomed to such freezing weather. Unfortunately, he didn't even have a thicker piece of clothing. When the air in the room became fresher, he closed the window. He put on his coarse cloth clothing underneath, then donned the guild's Ice-elemental Great Mage's robe over it. Feeling the ice-elemental aura flowing on the magic robe, he cast an Ice Body Technique on himself, and only then did he no longer feel cold.\n\nThe mercenaries of the Ice Moon Mercenary Group were all up early, preparing their belongings under the command of Kalo and the two vice-captains. Each person carried a small, not-too-large bundle on their back and a standard warrior's sword. Over thirty people. Yet, they made very little noise. Curiously, four identical strange items were placed in the inn's courtyard. Each had a chair in the middle, connected on both sides by long, thick bamboo poles, looking somewhat odd.\n\n\"Nianbing, you're already up. I originally planned to call you all after everything was ready. Go have some breakfast; we'll be setting off soon.\"\n\nLooking at Kalo's confident smile, Nianbing pointed at the strange items in the courtyard and asked, \"Captain, what are these things for?\"\n\nKalo chuckled, \"There were originally three. Since you came, I had someone make one more. These are specially prepared for you mages. Heavenly Surge Mountain is undeveloped, and the roads are rugged and difficult to traverse. It would be too hard for you mages. If you relied on magic to advance, it would consume a lot of your magic power. So, I specially prepared these items for your convenience. These were invented by the Langmu Empire and are called sedan chairs. You'll be very comfortable sitting on them, and with our warriors carrying them, not only will it speed up the journey, but it will also save you a lot of energy.\"\n\nNianbing secretly praised Kalo's thoughtfulness in his heart, but verbally he said, \"Captain, isn't this a bit improper? How can we trouble the warrior brothers?\"\n\nKalo smiled slightly. \"It's no trouble. In crucial moments, we'll still have to rely on you mages to save our lives. To us, you four mages are vital lifesavers!\"\n\nAn hour later, Nianbing and his group finally set off. This time, the Ice Moon Mercenary Group deployed a total of thirty-three people, including three Martial Fighters, thirty warriors with Great Swordsman strength, plus Ziqingmeng and his sister, Feng Nü, and Nianbing, making a total of four mages. The team reached a total of forty people.\n\nHe hadn't paid attention to the city when they arrived that night. After leaving the inn, Nianbing observed that Heavenly Surge City was pitifully small compared to large cities. One could even see the western city wall directly from the eastern city wall. There were no large shops in the entire city, and judging by appearances, most of the city's residents made their living by hunting.\n\nOutside the city, they could already see a vast expanse of gray mountains in the distance, stretching endlessly. Some peaks were covered by thick clouds. The feeling of sitting in a sedan chair was indeed very comfortable. Carried by two Great Swordsman warriors, the sedan chair was extremely stable, with only slight tremors up and down. Aside from the cold, this was hardly going on a mission; it was practically a pleasure trip. The entire mercenary team was orderly. Kalo was at the very front, thirty mercenaries surrounded the four mages in the center, and the two vice-captains and Feng Nü walked at the very end of the team, forming what could be called a small battle formation.\n\nLong Ling sat in the sedan chair expressionlessly, clad in thick white fur. Lita and Feng Yun also wore very thick leather clothing. Among the four mages, Nianbing appeared the most shabbily dressed. The warriors advanced very quickly; although they seemed to be walking, each step covered a distance of over three meters. Even if it couldn't compare to a galloping horse, it wasn't much slower. The scenery on both sides of the road continuously flashed by, and gusts of cold wind blew. Nianbing's Ice Body Technique was somewhat unable to resist. Although Fire-elemental magic could generate a large amount of heat, it couldn't last long. In desperation, he had no choice but to continuously cast Ice Body Technique on himself and take out his Righteous Yang Blade to warm himself by tucking it into his embrace. Only then did he feel a bit better, secretly regretting that he should have bought a thicker coat before coming out.\n\nUnder the warriors' steady advance, an hour later, they had already entered the range of the Heavenly Surge Mountain Range. The mountains in winter were bare, with only occasional bird calls heard. The entire mountain range gave off a feeling of lifelessness. Not long after entering the mountains, Kalo stopped in a sheltered mountain hollow. \"Everyone, let's rest for a bit before continuing. Change sedan chair bearers and remain vigilant.\"\n\nThe sedan chairs were placed on the ground, and the four, Nianbing included, disembarked. The warriors guarded every important corner around them. Kalo approached Lita, pulled out something resembling a map from his pocket, and quietly discussed something with Lita. Nianbing, content to be idle, took out his large pot from his spatial ring, called Ziqingjian to blast a hole in the ground with battle qi, gathered ice elements, and filled the large pot with ice. Then, he directly heated the iron pot with a Fire Spell. In a short while, the ice melted under the fire's heat and gradually became warm. While maintaining the magic, Nianbing said, \"It's so cold, everyone, come have some hot water. We'll be on our way again soon.\" Even for the strongest person, being able to drink some hot water in winter was an extremely wonderful thing.\n\nThe water boiled. Feng Yun came to Nianbing's side and took out a stack of bowls from his spatial magic item. \"Nianbing, let me help you. Your magic is truly amazing!\"\n\nFeng Yun was an Earth-elemental mage, most skilled in defense. Nianbing nodded at him, took out a spoon from his spatial ring, scooped water into each bowl, and invited everyone to drink.\n\nKalo's laughter rang out. \"Nianbing, you're truly an excellent quartermaster! It's great to have hot water to drink on such a cold day. Come, come, I have some excellent tea leaves here. Let's boil them in there to add some flavor for everyone.\"\n\n\"No, don't put in tea leaves.\" Nianbing stopped Kalo, saying, \"Plain boiled water is the most nourishing. While tea is good, it will speed up the body's metabolism, making one hungrier and overly excited more easily. Plain water is better. You can save these tea leaves as seasoning; I might use them when I cook.\"\n\nEveryone drank the hot water. The mercenary group's warriors already regarded Nianbing as one of their own, and everyone gladly accepted him as a mage. After all, Nianbing had first won them over through their stomachs.\n\nAfter drinking some hot water, Nianbing himself felt much more comfortable. Suddenly, a chill ran through his body. He subconsciously looked to his left. Two other people made the same movement simultaneously: one was Feng Nü, and the other was Hua Rui, who had a barrel-shaped figure.",

    "content": "Hua Rui let out a low cry with her raucous voice.\n\nDisplaying a speed entirely disproportionate to her body, her whole being shot out like a giant meatball, heading towards the hillock she had previously seen.\n\nCarlo reacted quickly, shouting, \"Protect the mages!\" A red figure flashed, and the first to arrive beside Nian Bing was none other than Feng Nü.\n\nNian Bing and Feng Nü exchanged a glance. He whispered, \"Did you feel it?\"\n\nFeng Nü nodded, saying, \"I'm afraid we've truly hit an iron plate this time. I'm very familiar with that aura; it's very likely the race I told you about last time.\" Just a moment before, Nian Bing and Feng Nü had simultaneously felt a sense of being watched. Nian Bing's magic power wasn't enough to generate such a feeling; he only discovered it because the Blazing Sun Blade in his arms suddenly grew hot, and his internal magic power experienced unstable fluctuations.\n\nSoon, Hua Rui's figure shot back, much of the makeup on her face having diminished due to the rapid propulsion. She came beside Carlo and said in a deep voice, \"Didn't see anyone.\"\n\nCarlo's brows furrowed slightly. He said, \"Didn't see? Can you estimate if it was human or beast?\"\n\nHua Rui shook her head, saying, \"Hard to say, but can a person really have such speed? My speed is already very fast, but I didn't even see a hair of a person, unless it's a Martial Saint. But there are only so few Martial Saints on the continent, so why would they come to such a bird-shit place? It's very likely a magic beast known for its speed. It's normal to have magic beasts in such large mountains; careful defense should prevent any issues. Carlo, let's act quickly and shorten the time, to avoid any changes.\"\n\nCarlo nodded, saying, \"Set off, everyone prepare for defense. Especially pay attention to protecting the four mages; immediately give a warning if danger is found.\"\n\nAfter setting off again, the atmosphere of the mercenary group clearly became tense. The formation changed from its original compactness to being a bit more spread out. This allowed them to control a larger area, guarding against surprise attacks from unknown enemies.\n\nFrom early morning until noon, the entire mercenary group had completely delved deep into the Tian Dang Mountain Range. That feeling from the beginning had not reappeared. Everything became normal again. Nian Bing always kept his eyes closed, his spiritual power extended outwards; relying on his spiritual perception of the outside world, it was clearer than seeing with his eyes. Every rustle of wind and grass around him could not escape his spiritual gaze. After hearing Feng Nü's words, he always felt something was amiss. Although that distinct feeling of being watched had disappeared, he still seemed to feel someone watching him from afar. What exactly was the race Feng Nü spoke of?\n\nThe mountain path became increasingly rugged. Ahead, four warriors continuously hacked and slashed at the dry, withered yellow thorns on the path with their long swords. The sedan chairs continued forward, surrounded by the warriors. Suddenly, Li Da's voice rang out, \"Everyone, stop for a moment. O Great Source of All Things! Please lend me your flowing gaze, let it spread throughout the world, and search for that mysterious aura. —Eye of Eternity.\"\n\nFaint blue light continuously converged towards Li Da. The water element aura in the air clearly grew stronger. Nian Bing, familiar with all types of magic, secretly exclaimed: \"This is the Eighth-tier Water Magic, Eye of Eternity!\"\n\nThe blue light grew stronger and stronger. Li Da raised his short magic staff. Enveloped in a faint blue halo, a sacred aura emanated from his body as his magic staff pointed forward. The dense blue halo surged into the earth, and clearly visible blue light continuously spread outwards. Li Da continuously murmured the incantation; he was like a source of water, continuously radiating ripples.\n\nAs the blue halo continuously expanded, everyone present clearly felt a gentle energy as if touching their bodies. The energy gradually dispersed, and everyone's senses were enhanced severalfold.\n\nNian Bing knew that Li Da must have discovered something, otherwise he would never have used this Eighth-tier water magic at the cost of consuming a large amount of magic power. The effect of the Eye of Eternity was very obvious: not only could it bring a much more acute sensation to his companions over a large area, but at the same time, within the magical range, it could observe all life auras. Water is the source of life; as long as water exists, the Eye of Eternity would not fail.\n\nThe blue halo disappeared. Li Da closed his eyes, ceasing the chanting of the incantation from his mouth. Everyone's gaze was focused on him, waiting quietly.\n\nSuddenly, Li Da's whole body convulsed. He unexpectedly collapsed onto the sedan chair without any warning, his body continuously twitching, foaming at the mouth, and his life aura rapidly disappearing.\n\nNian Bing was very close to Li Da; seeing this, he was immediately startled. He quickly jumped off his own sedan chair and came to Li Da's side, grasping his palm and transmitting his pure magic into Li Da's body. At the same time, his expression also grew solemn. He had seen this kind of situation, happening to Li Da, described in magic books: when a mage uses a detection-type magic to probe the surrounding environment, a backlash occurs if they encounter a spiritual power counterattack far greater than their own. With Li Da's Archmage strength, even mages at the Magus realm would absolutely not be strong enough to cause his Eighth-tier magic to backlash to this extent. Thus, it seemed that not only did the Tian Dang Mountain Range have hidden enemies, but the enemies' strength also far exceeded their own expectations.\n\nLong Ling took Li Da's other hand. Ice and water shared the same origin; both she and Nian Bing transmitted ice magic power into Li Da's body, hoping to help him break free from the backlash.\n\nWith the full help of the two Grand Mages, Li Da's convulsions gradually disappeared, but he still didn't regain consciousness. Nian Bing hesitated for a moment, then waved his right hand in the air, and the Sigh of the Ice Goddess appeared in his palm. He placed the Stone of the Ice Goddess against Li Da's forehead, then transmitted his ice magic power into Li Da's body through the Stone of the Ice Goddess. At the same time, he took out the box containing the Holy Radiance Stone, opened it, and placed the Holy Radiance Stone against Li Da's chest. One was for awakening the mind, the other for stabilizing the spirit. Under the effect of the two peerless gems, Li Da finally let out a long breath and slowly opened his eyes.\n\n\"Teacher Li Da, how are you? What exactly did you see that caused the backlash to be so strong?\" Nian Bing impatiently asked the doubt in his heart.\n\nLong Ling pulled out a handkerchief from her bosom and helped Li Da wipe away the filth from the corner of his mouth, whispering, \"Let Teacher Li Da rest first.\"\n\nLi Da shook his head. Feeling the magic power transmitted from Nian Bing, he managed a faint smile. \"Thanks to you. Otherwise, I wouldn't even know how I died. It was too terrifying; it was a patch of red, a patch of red that couldn't be clearly seen. But within the red, there was an incomparably powerful overbearing aura. My spiritual power, guided by water, had just tried to probe its secrets when I couldn't feel anything anymore. My spiritual power received a huge shock, and the magic power I released seemed as if it was about to collapse.\"\n\nNian Bing said in a deep voice, \"In what direction is this place you probed?\"\n\nLi Da said, \"In the center of the Tian Dang Mountain Range. Just now, I suddenly felt something was wrong. You know, water and ice are both very sensitive to fire. On this day of severe cold, I suddenly felt my whole body grow warm, as if a fire element aura was being artificially manipulated around us. Plus what happened before, that's why I decided to conduct a large-scale search, but I didn't expect that as soon as the magic began, I was almost killed by the backlash.\"\n\nNian Bing turned his gaze to Carlo beside him, saying, \"Guild Leader, the place recorded on your treasure map wouldn't happen to be the center of this mountain range, would it?\"\n\nCarlo smiled bitterly, \"I wish it wasn't, but the fact is exactly so. According to the treasure map, the location of the treasure is in a mountain in the center of Tian Dang Mountain. We can only cross-reference the direction and then discuss further. At our current rate of advance, it will take approximately three more days to reach there. However, since Mage Li Da has discovered danger, we need to consider it carefully.\"\n\nHua Rui, the \"water bucket\" beside Carlo, snorted, \"What is there to consider? Perhaps what Archmage Li Da discovered is just a volcano; can you say a volcano's energy isn't enough? Let's not worry ourselves sick here; let's get there first and then talk. Even if there's danger, what is there to fear? We have so many people; if we can't win, can't we run? We've spent a lot of time and effort on this mission; are we going to give up halfway?\"\n\nGatlin, on the side, said, \"I agree with Hua Rui. We cannot easily give up because of a small warning sign.\"\n\nCarlo said, \"I don't mean to give up; I just hope everyone can be a bit more careful so we can better complete the mission. It's already noon, everyone rest in place first, and let Archmage Li Da rest a bit.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at the dimmed gaze of Li Da, and whispered, \"Teacher Li Da, could that be a volcano?\"\n\nLi Da thought for a moment and said, \"I can't be sure, but what's certain is that it's indeed massive fire-attribute energy. Nian Bing, this operation seems more difficult than imagined. You must promise me one thing: if the danger is so great that we absolutely cannot cope, you must protect Ling'er and leave this place no matter what. This is what I promised the Guild Leader. As it looks now, my magic power simply cannot recover without two days. I'm entrusting this matter to you.\"\n\nNian Bing looked up at Long Ling; she seemed not to have heard Li Da's words. \"Teacher Li Da, please rest assured. You don't need to remind me; I will also try my best to protect Ling'er. It's just that my strength is too low; I might not be able to meet your expectations.\"\n\nLi Da smiled faintly, saying, \"Do your utmost and leave the rest to fate. Ah, if my magic hadn't been disrupted just now, I could have probed more of the surrounding situation. Now we can only advance recklessly. I also hope what I discovered was a volcano.\"\n\nNian Bing saw something in Li Da's eyes. Likewise, he also understood that it simply couldn't be a volcano. An amateur, not a mage, might have that misunderstanding; how could he? The Eye of Eternity uses water as its source; the question is, could water possibly exist in a volcano? If it really was a volcano, Li Da should have seen nothing at all.\n\nFeng Nü had arrived beside Nian Bing at some unknown point. She whispered, \"Are you truly decided on continuing forward?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"I currently have no reason to withdraw. However, things truly played out as you predicted. Feng Nü, can you really not tell me what race it is?\"\n\nFeng Nü hesitated for a moment but still shook her head, saying, \"Perhaps things aren't as serious as imagined. As long as we don't infringe upon that race's interests, conflicts won't escalate. That race has always had no interest in money or treasures, so I think the treasure you're looking for might not be related to them. Therefore, you don't need to worry too much.\"\n\nHearing Feng Nü's words, Nian Bing's heart relaxed somewhat. \"I hope so.\"\n\nWithout further words, Nian Bing went to the side, had two mercenaries help set up a stove, and then had the Wind Cloud Mage take out some food from the spatial magic items, beginning to cook for everyone.\n\nAfter all, he had to cook for over thirty people, so Nian Bing chose the simplest method: soaking clean rice in water, lighting a fire underneath, and at the same time, slicing the chicken from the ingredients into strips and putting it into the pot, then pitting the dates and putting them in, adding some salt and stirring well, thus beginning the cooking process. With so many people and in a hidden danger, he couldn't afford to show off his cooking skills; replenishing everyone's strength and filling their stomachs was most important. This shredded chicken and date rice was perfect; it had an excellent effect on replenishing strength. During the cooking process, Nian Bing directly inserted the blade of the Blazing Sun Blade into the pot, and combined with his fire magic, he quickly prepared a lunch for everyone that, though not sumptuous, was delicious.\n\nAfter eating, every mercenary's physical strength was well recovered. Carlo didn't give everyone more time to rest, and they soon set off, their goal still the deepest part of the Tian Dang Mountain Range.\n\nSetting out again, Li Da became the most important protected target, positioned in the very center of the team. He had only eaten a little something at noon, and then had been meditating on the sedan chair, striving to recover his magic power sooner.\n\nThe winter mountains were not entirely bare; some cold-resistant plants still grew. The mercenary group's route primarily followed mountain hollows, which saved more physical strength. After they successfully passed through several large mountains, the sky had gradually darkened. A day of intense travel had covered a long distance; however, the mountain path, after all, limited their speed of advance, and they still had two days to go until their destination.\n\nThat evening, Carlo chose a flat ground in a mountain hollow to camp. Tents were set up one by one. After a simple dinner, he invited Nian Bing and the two vice-captains into his tent. After Li Da had consumed a large amount of magic power, the most important mage in Carlo's eyes was undoubtedly Nian Bing.\n\nThe four people sat in a circle. Carlo spread out a worn map. This was Nian Bing's first time seeing what the treasure map looked like; he saw that the treasure map was made of a type of leather, itself displaying an earthy yellow color, and the patterns on it were all drawn in red. What it depicted was the Tian Dang Mountain Range. The reason they could identify this was because the treasure map had a single annotation in the bottom left corner: the location of Tian Dang City. With this clear indication, they could find the basic location.",

    "content": "The treasure map, though ancient in appearance, depicted the Tiandang Mountain Range with remarkable clarity, detailing hundreds of large and small peaks. The red 'X' Kalo had mentioned was located at the foot of a tall mountain in the center.\n\nKalo pointed at the map and said, \"We are currently at this position. Although we didn't encounter any obstacles today, you must all have sensed that this operation probably won't be very smooth.\"\n\nGatlin nodded, saying, \"It's too quiet, terrifyingly quiet. Even in winter, there shouldn't be absolutely no animals in these vast mountains. Yet, since we entered, we haven't encountered anything. It's as if something unseen is controlling this mountain range.\"\n\nKalo nodded. \"What worries me most is the backlash Li'da the Archmage's magic encountered today.\"\n\nHuarei said, \"Indeed! It wasn't a volcano, but I had to say that at the time.\"\n\nNianbing's heart stirred, and his opinion of Huarei immediately changed. This strikingly beautiful vice-leader was not as simple as she appeared. It turned out she also knew it wasn't a volcano, meaning her words then must have been to stabilize morale.\n\nKalo's gaze turned to Nianbing. \"Nianbing, what are your thoughts?\"\n\nNianbing thought for a moment and said, \"I have only one thought: withdraw from here and abandon this mission.\"\n\nGatlin scoffed coldly, \"Are you scared?\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly. \"Scared? If fear can save one's life, then what's wrong with being scared? I will absolutely not allow myself to fall into an irreversible crisis due to recklessness. If I could choose, I think it's better to abandon this mission. Because that unknown danger is probably not something we can contend with.\"\n\nGatlin said angrily, \"Kid, do you know how much we've paid for this operation? Just the guild's high commission paid to you alone amounts to over ten thousand gold coins! Plus other expenses, it's already equivalent to three months of the guild's income. How can we just give up like this?\"\n\nNianbing met Gatlin's gaze without flinching, saying, \"I only know one principle: as long as the green mountains remain, there will be wood to burn. Of course, I also understand your current thinking. Until you truly hit a wall, I doubt you will give up. Since I've promised Guild Master Kalo to participate in this operation, I will certainly see it through with you. However, there's something I must declare first: if we encounter an insurmountable enemy, I will retreat immediately without hesitation. Don't blame me when that happens.\"\n\n\"You…\" Gatlin abruptly stood up, his entire aura surging. As a Martial Artist, his battle qi flared outwards, and his eyes flashed repeatedly, seemingly contemplating whether he should deal with Nianbing first.\n\nHuarei chuckled, leaning closer to Nianbing. \"Young brother, by the looks of it, you must have discovered something. Why are you so certain we cannot handle this mission?\"\n\nNianbing snorted coldly, saying, \"I haven't discovered any enemies. But don't you all feel that ever since we entered the Tiandang Mountain Range, the closer we get to the heart of the mountains, the higher the surrounding temperature becomes? Although the change isn't obvious, for the harsh winter season, it seems a bit too warm now, doesn't it?\"\n\nHis words jolted them awake. Gatlin's face grew solemn as he sat down, exchanging glances with Kalo. They truly hadn't noticed this issue; only now, with Nianbing bringing it up, did they realize it was indeed the case.\n\nKalo took a deep breath. \"Nianbing, what you say makes sense. However, before undertaking this mission, we've already received a partial commission from the employer. If we just go back like this, according to the rules, we'd have to repay triple the amount. While the guild can afford that, the loss would be too great, especially in terms of reputation. So, we must try. Rest assured, if we truly encounter danger, we will prioritize protecting you few key individuals. If you agree, you can let your friends leave first; we absolutely won't stop them. How about that?\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly. \"Since the Guild Master has decided, I have nothing more to say. Let's just be careful. As for my friends, you needn't worry; unless we are completely annihilated, they will be fine.\"\n\n\"Ah—\" A piercing scream came from outside. The four people inside the tent simultaneously changed color. With a flash of light, Kalo and the two vice-leaders had already rushed out, while Nianbing had already gripped two magic scrolls in his hand.\n\n\"What happened?\" Kalo's low voice echoed as torches lit up one by one across the camp. All the mercenaries grew tense, drawing their long swords and cautiously observing the pitch-black surroundings.\n\nLongling and Fengnv had both emerged from their tents. Longling's gaze searched through the crowd. When she saw Nianbing, she visibly relaxed, resuming her forlorn expression.\n\nNianbing's gaze swept around. He muttered a few incantations and then launched an Exploding Flame into the air. Firelight burst forth, instantly illuminating the surroundings. Because the light came so suddenly, a dark figure flashed like lightning through the forest, fleeing into the distance. Huarei roared, her massive body crashing through a small tree. With two broadaxe-like broadaxes in hand, she pursued the dark figure as lightly as a swallow. Gatlin, clearly having cooperated with Huarei for many years, displayed astonishing synergy. He lunged towards the direction where the dark figure had first appeared, as the initial scream had come from there.\n\nNianbing paid no attention to this. After casting the Exploding Flame spell, he immediately went to Fengnv's side and whispered something into her ear. Fengnv frowned slightly but still nodded slowly. All of this was seen by Longling, and her forlorn gaze gained a simplified and desolate look of sorrow.¹\n\nAfter a while, Huarei and Gatlin both returned. Huarei's massive broadaxe bore a trace of blood, while Gatlin carried back a person—a mercenary. There was no longer any sign of life in his body, and his neck was strangely twisted. Clearly, a broken neck was the cause of his death.\n\nThe entire mercenary group's atmosphere had changed. Gatlin said, his voice cold and weary, \"There are no signs of resistance. He must have been successfully ambushed. The attacker was incredibly ruthless, directly twisting his neck. Who can tell me why he went into the forest alone?\"\n\nA mercenary whispered, \"He went to relieve himself. We heard the scream just as he entered the woods.\"\n\nKalo's expression remained calm. His gaze turned to Huarei. \"What did you find on your end?\"\n\nHuarei said, \"It was indeed human; that much could be determined from its build. It didn't engage me directly; its speed was incredibly astonishing. I chased with all my might and only barely caught up using my Shadow Glide skill. Perhaps it didn't expect my speed to suddenly increase, and in its carelessness, I managed to hack its back with an axe. However, that person seemed to be wearing some kind of armor. Its back was extremely hard, like iron armor, but even more solid than iron armor. Though my axe strike was hurried, it carried sixty percent of my strength, yet it only managed to graze its body. After using Shadow Glide, my speed temporarily decreased, so I couldn't catch up. However, I noticed that person seemed to have a pair of red eyes. It looked rather eerie. Thanks to Nianbing's fireball. Otherwise, in the darkness, we wouldn't have been able to spot its figure at all.\"\n\nNianbing said, \"That person must have been startled by my fireball, which is why they chose to flee immediately. From now on, no matter what you're doing, at least three people must be together. That way, we can at least defend against the enemy's attacks and give our people a chance to be rescued.\"\n\n\"Watch out!\" Fengnv's voice suddenly rang out. Nianbing, without any hesitation, immediately crushed a scroll in his hand. a Fourth-tier Ice Wall spell appeared directly around his body. A great force struck, and Nianbing's body instinctively lunged forward. The Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God simultaneously leaped into his hands. Without looking back, relying entirely on spiritual lock-on to pinpoint the opponent's position, a fireball and an ice ball shot out simultaneously, attacking the opponent.\n\nWith a thunderous crash, Nianbing's Ice-Fire Duality, which had once easily shattered the bodies of high-level warriors, unleashed considerable power this time as well. A gasp of surprise came from mid-air. Huarei and Gatlin had already charged up simultaneously, their two broadaxes and one cold blade heading straight for the figure that had just ambushed Nianbing in the air.\n\nCrimson light instantly flared, and scorching air currents permeated the air. Amidst a loud crash, Huarei and Gatlin's upward momentum was halted, while the downward-striking dark figure rebounded high into the air. A hoarse voice echoed, \"This is just a warning. Leave this place immediately, or you will be buried in Tiandang, becoming fertilizer here.\" The voice vanished with the figure. By the time Gatlin and Huarei landed, the dark figure's tracks were already lost, making further pursuit impossible.\n\nKalo stood beside Nianbing, long sword in hand, asking with concern, \"Are you alright?\"\n\nNianbing, with lingering fear, glanced at the pile of ice powder behind him. He truly doubted if the triggered magic scrolls on his person could have saved his life without Fengnv's sudden warning. The Fourth-tier Ice Wall spell was the strongest defensive spell among all Fourth-tier magic, yet it only slightly obstructed the opponent. Judging from Kalo's actions, it wasn't the magic that truly saved him, but Kalo himself.\n\nHe shook his head and said, \"I'm fine, thank you, Guild Master, for saving me.\"\n\nKalo forced a wry smile. \"It seems what you said makes a lot of sense. I just exchanged blows with that person, and it's clear his strength is definitely not inferior to mine. As it stands, we now have at least two Martial Artist-level enemies.\"\n\nNianbing sighed. \"But I understand this won't shake your resolve, will it?\"\n\nKalo nodded firmly. \"To face difficulties head-on has always been my principle.\"\n\nLaughter suddenly rang out. Nianbing turned to look and saw that it was Ziqingmeng laughing. \"You two should switch ages. The younger one is cautious like an old man, while the older one is stubborn like a youth.\"\n\nKalo sighed lightly. \"Guards continue your patrol, everyone else return to your tents to sleep. What Nianbing said earlier is now my order: any activity must involve at least three people together.\"\n\nEverything returned to calm. Nianbing returned to his tent this time, recalling the immensely powerful blow from earlier. He couldn't help but feel a lingering fear. Who exactly was the enemy? If, as Fengnv said, it was a race, then what kind of race could exist in the mountains, ascending from below? Yet, judging by their ability to speak human language and their human-like appearance, they should be human! Where would another race come from?\n\nTaking a deep breath, the hidden enemy's ambush created a strong sense of crisis for Nianbing. As one of the crucial members of the mercenary group, he was clearly the easiest target for the opponent's attacks. He absolutely had to strengthen his vigilance and defense. Otherwise, dying inexplicably in these mountains would be too worthless.\n\nThe coordinated ambush put the entire mercenary group on edge. However, no further incidents occurred during the latter half of the night. When sunlight illuminated the earth, bringing light to the Tiandang Mountain Range, a new day began. The deceased mercenary was reduced to ashes by Nianbing's fire magic. His mercenary comrades would carry his ashes and bury them upon returning to the Ice Moon Empire.\n\nGazing at the undulating mountain peaks, Kalo raised his hand and firmly uttered two words: \"Advance!\"\n\nThe previous night's blow seemed to have completely vanished; he was still full of confidence. But Nianbing observed that Kalo's hand was always gripping the sword hilt at his waist in a reverse grip.\n\nThe atmosphere of the second day's advance was even more tense than the first. The mercenaries were constantly paying attention to their surroundings, as if fearing someone might suddenly leap out and twist their necks. It was no wonder they were so nervous; the tragic death of their comrade had cast a shadow over the entire mercenary group. Fortunately, Kalo and the two vice-leaders remained extremely calm, and their subordinates were all well-trained and had seen major battles. Apart from becoming more cautious, no unusual behavior was observed.\n\nStrangely, the enemy who had come to warn them yesterday did not reappear on the second day after the mercenary group entered the mountains. Nianbing even found that the feeling of being watched had vanished. The entire day passed peacefully amid urgent travel. Nevertheless, after setting up camp, Kalo personally inspected every tent and specifically instructed the patrolling mercenaries on what to look out for. The defense for the entire night was led separately by the two vice-leaders, one for the first half and one for the second.\n\nPatting his stomach, Nianbing thought, \"What I cook is still the best.\" He lay down contentedly in his tent; the soft mat from his Spatial Ring was definitely the ultimate comfort at this moment. For two days, he had been in charge of all the meals. Every mealtime was when the mercenaries could completely relax. Because of this, the mercenaries' favorable impression of Nianbing continuously grew. When traveling, they deliberately moved closer to him, to guard against another ambush. Two days had passed, and Li'da's magic power had recovered seventy to eighty percent; he was no longer so weak. However, he also dared not use magic to probe further into the Tiandang Mountain Range.\n\n---\n¹ The phrase \"刪繁就簡悽然之色\" (shān fán jiù jiǎn qī rán zhī sè) literally means \"to simplify the complicated, a desolate look.\" It appears to be a garbled or erroneous phrase in the original text, as it does not fit the context of describing an expression. It likely should have been something simpler like \"多了一丝凄然之色\" (gained a trace of sorrow). This translation preserves the original phrasing as closely as possible, but its meaning in this context is unclear.",

    "content": "「Nian Bing, I'm coming in,\" Feng Nü's voice came from outside the tent.\n\nThe mercenary group's single-person tents weren't large, only able to fit one person lying flat. Hearing Feng Nü's voice, Nian Bing quickly sat up. \"Please come in.\"\n\nThe tent flap was lifted, and Feng Nü stepped into the tent and sat down. Her pink hair<sup>1</sup> cascaded over her shoulders, accentuating her exquisite beauty, making her look incredibly captivating. Thinking of how he had once embraced that perfect alluring body, Nian Bing's heart couldn't help but warm. \"Feng Nü, do you need something?\"\n\nFeng Nü's expression seemed a little worried. \"Nian Bing, things are looking very bad!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, saying, \"Now you should tell me what that race is, right?\"\n\nFeng Nü sighed, saying, \"I'm sorry, I absolutely cannot violate the agreement of our predecessors. Since we've already arrived here, I'm afraid we can only move forward. Others might not have been clear last night, but I clearly saw the appearance of the person who ambushed you. Just as I judged, they are indeed from that clan. Do you know why they haven't appeared again today? It's not to let us go, but because they already harbor killing intent. The moment we truly enter the interior of the mountain range will be the moment they make their move.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned slightly, saying, \"So, this is the calm before the storm. Tomorrow's journey will likely be difficult.\"\n\nFeng Nü nodded, saying, \"Precisely.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Unfortunately, I can no longer persuade President Carlo. Without a result, they will definitely not give up. We'll just have to take it one step at a time. Don't trouble yourself about what I told you last night.\"\n\nFeng Nü nodded, saying, \"I can only do my best. After all, plans can't keep up with changes.\"\n\nNian Bing suddenly chuckled softly, saying, \"You smell so good! You haven't bathed in at least two days, how are you still so fragrant?\"\n\nFeng Nü was startled at first. Then her pretty face flushed slightly, and she said, \"Look at the time. You still have the mood to joke around.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, saying, \"The tenser the moment, the more we need to relax our minds. That way we can face things better, don't you think? You still haven't answered my question.\"\n\nFeng Nü snorted, saying, \"My people and I naturally have the ability to keep ourselves clean. Even if we don't bathe for months, our clothes might get dirty, but our bodies absolutely won't. Alright, I came to see you, not to make you give up, but just to remind you to be careful. When things become impossible, run quickly.\" After speaking, she stood up, gave Nian Bing a glare, and then left the tent.\n\nThe person was gone, but the fragrance lingered. Nian Bing took a deep breath; he realized his infatuation with Feng Nü was growing deeper. He took out the small flute from his spatial bag, the one Feng Nü had given him but he had never used, and his heart felt a warmth. Although their relationship had always remained on the level of friends, Feng Nü's concern for him was perfectly tangible.\n\nJust then, the tent flap was suddenly lifted, and a graceful figure walked in. Nian Bing thought Feng Nü had returned, but when he looked up, he saw the one who entered was Zi Qingmeng, her face cold.\n\n\"Miss Zi? Do you need something?\" Nian Bing asked, a little surprised.\n\nZi Qingmeng glanced at the flute in Nian Bing's hand. She sat down unceremoniously in front of Nian Bing, saying, \"I came to find you for two things. The first is for my brother, and the second is for the treasure site we'll reach tomorrow.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at her with interest, saying, \"Specifically?\"\n\nZi Qingmeng said, \"I can see that your relationship with Feng Nü is quite unusual. This is your private matter, and I originally have no right to interfere. However, you must have noticed that ever since Feng Nü appeared, my brother has fallen uncontrollably in love with her. If Feng Nü is your girlfriend, I hope you can officially tell my brother, to spare him from further fantasies. I don't want him to suffer the pain of unrequited love.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, saying, \"I'm afraid I can't help you with this. It's not that I don't want to, but because I simply don't have the authority to help you. Feng Nü and I are just friends. How can I speak as her boyfriend?\"\n\nZi Qingmeng snorted, a hint of anger in her voice. \"You're just friends? Tell that to the ghosts! Did you think I didn't see how tightly you embraced her that day? If you were just friends, would she let you take such liberties? If you were just friends, would she let you sleep on her shoulder?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred slightly. What Zi Qingmeng said was true. Remembering the scene from that day, he was honestly a bit surprised himself. He hadn't expected Feng Nü to be so indulgent towards him. Could Feng Nü truly have those kinds of feelings for him? \"Miss Zi, let's put this matter aside for now. We'll reach the treasure site tomorrow, and unknown dangers await us. How about this: if everyone returns safely, I'll discuss it with Feng Nü. As long as she agrees to keep up the act with me, I'll cooperate. How's that?\"\n\nZi Qingmeng pondered for a moment, then asked with a slightly strange voice, \"Are you and Feng Nü really not a couple? What about that female magician? Isn't she your girlfriend?\"\n\nNian Bing said, somewhat impatiently, \"Do you seem to wish every girl was my girlfriend? Then why don't you be my girlfriend too? To be frank with you, I'm single now, and I'll remain single for a long time in the future. I only have friends, no girlfriends. I hope you won't dwell on this issue anymore. Now, you can tell me about the second matter.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng's pretty face inexplicably flushed. She lowered her head and said, \"I'm sorry, I was being meddlesome.\"\n\nNian Bing was startled. It was the first time he had seen Zi Qingmeng display such an expression. Since the girl had apologized, his tone immediately softened. \"It's fine, I just got agitated because everyone has some misunderstandings about my personal life.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng looked up at Nian Bing and said, \"What happened last night gave me an ominous premonition. Feng Nü is so strong, she can protect herself reliably, but my brother and I might not be able to. As you know, I'm only a swordsman. If we encounter an ambush like that, I'm afraid... So, if we encounter enemies, could you use magic to look after my brother and me?\" Seeing Nian Bing's surprised gaze, she quickly explained, \"We're not afraid of death, and my brother doesn't know I came to you. But my brother and I are both heirs to Lan Meng Academy. Our father only has the two of us children. So, no matter what, we must prioritize our lives. That's why I came to you. Will you help us?\"\n\nNian Bing said seriously, \"Miss Zi, although we haven't known each other for long, we are at least friends. You don't need to worry about this. I don't mind protecting friends, provided I am safe myself.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng smiled, and Nian Bing realized she looked much better when she smiled than when her face was cold.\n\n\"Thank you, Nian Bing.\" Zi Qingmeng stood up, about to leave the tent.\n\n\"Miss Zi, don't you think my answer was too...<sup>2</sup>?\" Nian Bing asked, a little curious.\n\nZi Qingmeng shook her head, her back to him, and said, \"No, of course not. At least this proves you're not a hypocrite. If you yourself are in danger, how could you protect us? Thank you for your promise.\" With that, she lifted the flap and left.\n\n\"So she's this rational. It seems no one should be underestimated. I hope I can bring them out of here alive,\" Nian Bing murmured to himself.\n\n\"Nian Bing, may I come in?\" A very soft voice came from outside.\n\nNian Bing groaned inwardly. One left, and another came, and they were all girls. If the mercenary group members saw this, who knew what they'd think? However, this last one was the one he could least refuse. To be precise, he even somewhat anticipated her arrival. \"Ling'er, come in quickly. It's cold outside.\"\n\nThe tent flap was lifted, and Long Ling, who hadn't spoken to Nian Bing since their meeting, walked in. She wasn't wearing her thick fur coat; the ice magic robe looked thin on her, and coupled with her pale, pretty face, she instantly evoked pity.\n\nLong Ling sat down opposite Nian Bing, a faint smile gracing her pretty face. \"Nian Bing, it's been months since we last met, are you well?\" Her expression seemed relaxed, but the hint of sorrow deep in her eyes remained unchanged.\n\n\"Ling'er, I'm fine, and you?\" After asking this, Nian Bing almost slapped himself. Could Long Ling's appearance be described with the word \"fine\"?\n\nUnexpectedly, Long Ling nodded affirmatively, saying, \"I'm very well! Do you know? Ever since you left, I've used the method you taught me to train my mental energy, and I quickly entered the Great Magician<sup>3</sup> realm. If I had more time to cultivate, I think I might even become an Archmage sooner than you.\"\n\nNian Bing lowered his head, saying, \"Then let me congratulate you first.\"\n\nLong Ling smiled indifferently, saying, \"There's nothing to congratulate. You're far more talented than I am. Oh, right, I haven't congratulated you yet: when are you and Miss Feng Nü getting married? If I'm still around, remember to send me an invitation.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart tightened, saying, \"Still around? What do you mean? Feng Nü and I are just ordinary friends, just like you and me. Don't misunderstand anything.\"\n\n\"Ordinary friends?\" Her sorrow intensified a few degrees. \"Then I misunderstood. But Miss Feng Nü is truly beautiful. You're not going to pursue such a beautiful girl?\"\n\nNian Bing sighed softly, saying, \"Remember what I once told you? I simply don't have the right to love now. That wasn't an excuse, but my true feelings.\"\n\nLong Ling smiled slightly, saying, \"That no longer concerns me. Oh, right, Father asked me to tell you not to forget to represent the Guild in the Grand Competition. In another half a year, the time will be up.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, saying, \"Since I promised them, I will definitely go.\"\n\nLong Ling's eyes brightened a bit. \"Then you must survive while carrying out this mission. Always prioritize your own life. Here, take this, put it on quickly.\" As she spoke, she pulled out an item of clothing from inside her magic robe. A faint golden-red light shimmered. It seemed to be a vest, looking extremely light and thin, like sheer gauze. Nian Bing subconsciously asked, \"What is this?\"\n\nLong Ling smiled slightly, saying, \"As you know, our bodies are the most vulnerable. Father asked me to bring you this vest. Wear it, and even if your opponent is a Martial Saint-level martial arts master, it can block most of their attack power for you. It's the best defensive item<sup>4</sup> for a magician. I don't know what material it's made of myself. Father once tested it; even a level ten magic spell couldn't destroy it, and it has special effects against battle qi. I came to you to complete this task Father gave me: to give this to you. I'm leaving now. Tomorrow, we might encounter danger, so be careful.\" After speaking, Long Ling handed the golden-red vest in her hand to Nian Bing, gave him a faint smile, and then turned and left.\n\nThe golden-red vest felt weightless in his hand. As he gently unfolded it, a faint, subtle fragrance wafted to his nose. Nian Bing didn't think much of it, his attention entirely on the vest. He casually cast a Fire Spell. Under the glow of the flames, the vest shimmered with a faint luster. Nian Bing had never seen this kind of fabric before. When he pulled it gently, the extremely elastic vest stretched a little, then returned to normal when he let go. No wonder Long Ling said the vest, which didn't look large on the surface, was given to her by the President.\n\nHaving an extra life-saving item was naturally a good thing. Nian Bing quickly took off his clothes and put the vest on, wearing it close to his skin. Indeed, the vest's elasticity was excellent; worn against the skin, it felt incredibly comfortable, like a second skin. Its breathability ensured no discomfort. Nian Bing subconsciously tried a Fire Spell on his body. There was no burning sensation at all, not even a mark on the vest. It was indeed a very good treasure.\n\nThe subtle fragrance that had appeared earlier became stronger after the vest was put on. As he caressed the soft vest, Nian Bing suddenly trembled all over. His brain felt as if it had been electrocuted, and he froze completely.\n\nHe pulled up a corner of the vest and brought it to his nose, sniffing it carefully. His body trembled slightly. What Master giving him a vest? What fearing his danger? Long Zhi couldn't possibly have guessed Ling'er would encounter him. Moreover, Ling'er is also a magician, and with such a good protective magic item, as a father, he naturally should give it to his own daughter. This fragrance was so familiar; it was clearly Ling'er's natural body fragrance! Obviously, this vest was originally worn by her. The protective treasure Long Zhi gave her, she gave to him, giving it to him before the crisis they would face tomorrow. If he still couldn't understand this affection, this silent affection, then he would be the biggest fool in the world. Ling'er, you're really so foolish. Why are you so good to me? I don't deserve this from you! Ling'er, I'm sorry, I've failed you too much.\n***\n<sup>1</sup> Original text: \"pink cascaded over her shoulders,\" missing a noun.

    "content": "Two crystal-clear teardrops slid down Nian Bing's cheeks. He knew that no matter what, he couldn't maintain his current attitude towards Long Ling. Ling'er had given him this vest, and combined with her previous words, she was clearly abandoning her own safety to look after him, and hadn't told him the truth, instead making up a story to deceive him. Nian Bing's heart trembled, trembling for the first time for a woman. His hands tightly gripped the edge of the vest, trying hard to control his emotions.\n\nLong Ling's gentleness constantly surfaced in his mind, churning in his heart. Her soft, beautiful face, her gentle voice, all deeply shook his heart.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Nian Bing barely managed to calm himself. \"Ling'er, how can I let you abandon your own safety for me? If that were the case, I wouldn't be worthy of being a man.\" His thoughts raced. Looking at the vest he wore that felt like nothing, he already had a plan. He picked up the Phoenix Flute lying nearby and gently began to play.\n\nThe next morning, Li Da finally recovered all his magic power. The entire Ice Moon Mercenary Group set out again. The mercenaries weren't lax in the slightest because of yesterday's calm, remaining alert to everything that might happen around them at all times.\n\nNian Bing sat on the bone pole, occasionally looking at Long Ling. Long Ling still had yesterday's expression, calm with a faint trace of sadness. Occasionally, she would raise her head to look into the distance, her eyes so empty. Nian Bing's heart ached. He knew he would never be able to forget Long Ling's current gaze.\n\nKarlo, his hand on his sword hilt, walked while looking at the map, shouting, \"Everyone, cheer up! We're getting closer and closer to our objective. After crossing two more towering mountains and rugged ridges, we'll find what we're looking for safely in a mountain hollow. To reunite with our families when we return, and to live better lives, all of you, cheer up! We all have to go back alive!\"\n\nNo sooner had he finished speaking than a low roar not far away made the entire mercenary group tense up. The ground shook, and a huge figure charged out from behind a hill not far ahead. Amidst its roars, its charge was aimed directly at the Ice Moon Mercenary Group.\n\nNian Bing was surprised to find that the monster that charged out was about eight chi tall,¹ its upper body erect. Its entire body was covered in an iron-gray keratinous layer, looking extremely sturdy. Its body shape was somewhat like a large lizard, but clearly much larger than a lizard. Two rows of black, fin-like structures stood erect on its back. Two powerful and thick hind legs supported its massive body, a long tail trailed behind.² When it roared, it revealed huge saber-like teeth in its mouth, saliva drooling. Its length from head to tail was nearly two zhang. Its front limbs were clearly much smaller than its hind limbs, but its claws were equally large. Its forward charge was extremely fast. \"Don't tell me we're that unlucky. It was an Iron-backed Earth Dragon.\"\n\nAlthough he secretly cursed his bad luck, Nian Bing didn't forget to warn his teammates. \"Everyone, be careful, this is an Iron-backed Earth Dragon, its defense is very strong!\" With a loud shout, he immediately began to gather magic power. Having witnessed the Iron-backed Earth Dragon's strength before, he didn't relax in the slightest.\n\nWhat brought Nian Bing some relief was that this was only one Iron-backed Earth Dragon. Its body was clearly much smaller than the one he had seen last time, and its charging power was also weaker. With a wave of his hands, fireballs and ice balls emerged together, launching the first attack towards the Iron-backed Earth Dragon.\n\nThis Iron-backed Earth Dragon clearly had little intelligence; its charging speed didn't decrease in the slightest, allowing the fireballs and ice balls to converge in front of it and unleash their strongest attack. With a thunderous roar, the Iron-backed Earth Dragon's forward charge slowed slightly. Just as Nian Bing had judged, the first-tier fusion magic from Ice-Fire Symbiosis had no effect on this big fellow. Even the unique aura of ice and fire, with insufficient attack power, couldn't affect its advance.³ Just as he was preparing to attack again, a massive figure had already charged out from among the mercenary group.\n\n\"Damn it, a little crawler dares to block our way? I'll chop you to death!\" Amidst angry roars, Hua Rui's plump body shot skyward, crashing into the Iron-backed Earth Dragon from below. Nian Bing, fearing he might accidentally harm her, quickly withdrew his magic.\n\nA strange scene unfolded. When the Iron-backed Earth Dragon, carrying its momentum, slammed its two claws towards Hua Rui's pair of huge battleaxes,⁴ with a loud boom, its forward momentum completely disintegrated. Two cracks appeared in each of its front claws. Hua Rui, however, showed no intention of letting it go; intense white battle qi surged from her body, empowering her huge battleaxes as she slashed at the Iron-backed Earth Dragon without any frills.\n\n\"An Earth Dragon running into a mama T-Rex, it can only count itself unlucky,\" a mercenary said, gloating.\n\nNo mercenaries went up to help; they seemed to have long been accustomed to Hua Rui's fighting style. Battle qi reaching the level of a Fighter, combined with her natural strength advantage, delivered a fatal blow to the Iron-backed Earth Dragon. Several consecutive loud bangs, accompanied by the grating sound of ripping cloth, echoed. Nian Bing was horrified to find that the Iron-backed Earth Dragon's massive head had separated from its body. Large gushes of blood constantly poured out, and its huge body crashed to the ground.\n\n\"Heavens! Is this still the Earth Dragon that nearly took my life back then? Although it's not the same level, it shouldn't have been chopped to death so easily, right?\" Nian Bing couldn't help but look at Hua Rui with a renewed sense of awe.\n\nHua Rui had been terribly cooped up these past two days. The enemies had been lurking in the shadows, appearing and disappearing like a cat toying with a mouse. Now that a direct attacker had suddenly emerged, how could she hold back? Under the effect of her formidable strength and battle qi, she actually split this Earth Dragon alive. Killing the Earth Dragon still didn't vent her frustration; her battleaxes repeatedly hacked at the Earth Dragon's massive body, sending sprays of blood flying.\n\nLong Ling had already lowered her head, somewhat unable to watch. Feng Nü and Zi Qingmeng didn't mind as much, but were equally astonished by Hua Rui's might.\n\n\"Rui Rui, that's enough. Save some strength. Who knows what's ahead,\" Karlo stopped Hua Rui's body-abusing actions. Hua Rui held up her twin axes, looking like she was asking who among the world's heroes could rival her. First, she roared like a monster, then in a coarse voice, she said, \"Damn it, let's see who dares to offend our Ice Moon Mercenary Group. Don't just say one Earth Dragon; even if ten or a hundred come, I'll chop them all to death just the same.\"\n\nGatlin's angry voice rang out, \"Shut your crow's mouth.\"\n\nHua Rui turned around angrily and said, \"What, you disagree? If you're so capable, let's fight.\"\n\nGatlin snorted and said, \"Idiot, look behind the hill.\"\n\nOnly then did everyone notice that there were over twenty Earth Dragons, walking out step by step from behind the hill. Their low roars gradually became clearer. The foremost Earth Dragon stomped the ground fiercely, and then, leading all the Earth Dragons, charged over like a tide.⁵\n\nOne Iron-backed Earth Dragon could already generate immense momentum. With over twenty Earth Dragons charging simultaneously, even the formidable 'mama T-Rex' Hua Rui couldn't help but change color. Such an impact force was something no one present could withstand.\n\nKarlo urgently shouted, \"Quick, get the mages to retreat! Try to engage in mobile combat, avoid direct confrontation!\"\n\nThe eight mercenaries originally responsible for carrying the pole stretcher quickly retreated. Just then, Nian Bing suddenly shouted, \"Don't move! Warriors, prepare for close-quarters combat. I'll deal with their charge.\" As he spoke, he waved his right hand repeatedly, and two magic scrolls flew out under his control. Red light and blue light appeared simultaneously; the Left Hand of the Flame God, accompanied by an enhanced single-color Ice Seal Sphere, flew towards the Earth Dragons.\n\nBack then, Nian Bing had once, by uniquely integrating,⁶ utilized the fifth-tier Ice-Fire Symbiosis fusion magic that made Archmage Long Zhi look at him with new eyes. Now, facing a large group of Earth Dragons, he once again employed his proficient ability. However, due to time constraints, he could only reluctantly throw out magic scrolls. He firmly believed that he still had three mages by his side. As long as they blocked the Earth Dragons' first wave of attack, support would arrive.\n\nHis current Ice-Fire Fusion magic was already different from before. Through a deep understanding of both magic types, Nian Bing truly unleashed the power of Ice-Fire Symbiosis. Two fifth-tier spells erupted simultaneously, generating an impact force equivalent to a seventh-tier spell. Even if it were a Golden-backed Earth Dragon here, it would absolutely not be comfortable, let alone these Iron-backed Earth Dragons.\n\nAmidst a tremendous roar, the four Earth Dragons at the very front were instantly blasted into the air, colliding with the Earth Dragons behind them. A large crater, more than two zhang in diameter, appeared on the ground. The Earth Dragons' forward momentum was instantly shattered. The blasted Earth Dragons had scales and flesh torn from their fronts; though not fatal, they suffered considerable injuries. Their strongest defensive area was their back; their chests were much weaker.\n\nKarlo reacted extremely quickly, understanding perfectly as he led the warriors to spread out their formation and charge towards the Earth Dragons. At this moment, Earth Archmage Feng Yun's first spell had also been completed just in time.\n\nThe earth vibrated violently. Centered on the large crater blasted out by Nian Bing, several huge fissures split open towards the Earth Dragons' side. It was the fifth-tier Earth Rift spell. Although Earth Rift couldn't directly harm the Earth Dragons, it was enough to slow their movements. Hua Rui, leading the charge, rushed towards the disorganized Earth Dragons. She now looked nothing like a woman; of course, in others' eyes, she had never been seen as a woman. The head of one blasted Earth Dragon flew into the air, spilling a gush of hot blood.\n\nGatlin also displayed his Fighter's strength, his body flashing as he lunged into the air. He wasn't as violent as Hua Rui, but his attacks were much more vicious. The short blade in his hand, like a viper's fangs, directly pierced into the most vulnerable eye of an Earth Dragon. He struck and left immediately, turning to the next Earth Dragon. The heavily wounded Earth Dragon roared, continuously attacking everything alive around it, most notably its own companions. Blood continuously flowed from its eye. Even if its body was strong, with a brain injury like that, it was absolutely impossible for it to survive. Death was only a matter of time.\n\nBattle qi of various colors shimmered among the mercenaries. Although they weren't as formidable as the two vice-treasurers,⁷ Battlemaster-level battle qi was certainly no joke. The mercenaries cooperated tacitly; some used mobile combat tactics to attract the Earth Dragons' attention, while others imitated Gatlin, specifically targeting the Earth Dragons' vulnerable eyes. Relying on battle qi for defense, even if they were truly hit by an Earth Dragon, as long as it wasn't a direct frontal collision, it would absolutely not be fatal. For a time, the entire situation developed favorably for the Ice Moon Mercenary Group.\n\nKarlo didn't act directly; instead, he observed the Earth Dragons in front of him. He was waiting. If his subordinates faced a crisis, calling for aid was the most important thing he should do. This was coordination, the most emphasized aspect of a high-level mercenary group.\n\nPerhaps Heaven wanted to play a trick on the Ice Moon Mercenary Group. Just as they had gained the upper hand, Feng Nü's surprised voice suddenly rang out, \"Everyone, be careful, there's more behind!\"\n\nThe eight mercenaries originally responsible for carrying the pole stretcher reacted immediately. When they turned to face what was behind them, they couldn't help but gasp. Because, what appeared behind them were also Iron-backed Earth Dragons, and their number had reached an astonishing thirty.\n\nZi Qingmeng exclaimed, \"Heavens! Did we walk into a lizard's nest?\"⁸ As she spoke, the short blade she had used when fighting Feng Nü back then leaped into her hand.\n\nZi Qingjian's Ice Blade was a broad-bladed heavy sword. With a flash, she blocked her younger sister behind her. At this moment, Zi Qingmeng's gaze was on Nian Bing. Nian Bing sighed helplessly, cursing himself for being careless. He should have gathered two spells earlier, but the Earth Dragons in front of him had already begun their charge. Left with no choice, he had to pull out two more scrolls.\n\nJust then, Li Da, who had not yet cast any spells, made his move. If previously the mercenaries had somewhat underestimated him because he had been nearly severely injured by the backlash from exploring magic, after this display of magic,⁹ no one would underestimate this highest-ranking mage present.\n\nAmidst low chants, his magic staff was raised high overhead. Rings of blue light converged forward, spinning rapidly. In the blink of an eye, a blue vortex gradually formed ahead. It was a true vortex. The extremely powerful Earth Dragon horde instantly charged into the vortex. Although their charging power was strong, it was absolutely not as great as the force of the vortex's rotation. Immediately, over thirty Earth Dragons were completely swept in. Their bodies continuously colliding with each other.¹⁰ What would be the effect of similarly hard bodies crashing into each other? A few hints of red appeared in the blue vortex.\n\n\"Water Vortex Fluctuation?\" Nian Bing was extremely surprised in his heart, because this was a very obscure spell within the Water element, belonging to the seventh-tier area-of-effect attack magic category. However, this spell's attack power was not strong; if there was only one enemy, it had virtually no offensive power at all. Once the magic power couldn't be sustained, the vortex would disappear, and besides causing some dizziness to the opponent, there was nothing special about it. Especially when used against warriors with martial skills, if their battle qi was strong enough, they could easily break out of the vortex. However, this spell's effect was extremely pronounced when used against an Earth Dragon horde with extremely strong charging power. It not only blocked their forward momentum but also caused them to suffer some damage from colliding with each other.\n\n---\n¹ The character used (盡, *jìn*) is likely a typographical error for 尺 (*chǐ*), meaning \"foot\" (a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 0.33 meters). Eight chi would be around 2.6 meters. The text later mentions the creature's length as \"nearly two zhang\" (roughly 6.6 meters), making a height of eight chi plausible.\n² The original phrase (手了在後面) appears to contain a typographical error. Based on context, it likely refers to the long tail moving or dragging behind the creature.\n³ The original phrase (它地先去) is a likely typographical error for \"它的行進\" (its advance) or \"它的前進\" (its progression).\n⁴ The original text contains \"車**斧\" (*chē**fǔ*), which appears to be a typographical error or an unusual descriptive term. Given the context and later mention of \"巨大的戰斧\" (huge battleaxes), it is likely referring to large, perhaps round or cartwheel-like, axes.\n⁵ The original phrase (副食著所有地龍如同汗水般沖了過來) contains two likely typographical errors. \"副食著\" (*fùshízhe*), meaning \"as a side dish,\" is nonsensical here and is likely a misspelling of \"率領著\" (*shuàilǐngzhe*), meaning \"leading.\" \"如同汗水般\" (*rúgōng hànshuǐbān*), meaning \"like sweat,\" is also nonsensical for a charge and is very likely a misspelling of \"如同潮水般\" (*rúgōng cháoshuǐbān*), meaning \"like a tide,\" a common descriptor for a large, overwhelming group movement.\n⁶ The original phrase (公私合營著, *gōngsīhéyíngzhe*) literally means \"through a public-private partnership.\" This is an extremely unusual and likely figurative or humorous idiom in the context of magic. It may imply a unique combination, synergy, or personal mastery (private) applied to general magical principles (public), or it could simply be a stylistic flourish.\n⁷ The original phrase (兩名副財長) literally translates to \"two vice-treasurers.\" In the context of a mercenary group, this is an unusual title and is likely a typographical error for \"副團長\" (*fùtuánzhǎng*, vice-captains) or \"副指揮\" (*fùzhīhuī*, vice-commanders), referring to a combat leadership role.\n⁸ The original phrase (馮進了, *féngjìnle*) is likely a typographical error for \"闖進了\" (*chuǎngjìnle*), meaning \"to burst into\" or \"to barge into.\"\n⁹ The original phrase (經過這個魔法賓) literally means \"after this magic guest.\" \"賓\" (*bīn*, guest) is a likely typographical error for \"法\" (*fǎ*, magic) or \"陣\" (*zhèn*, formation), implying \"after this spell\" or \"after this magic formation.\"\n¹⁰ The original phrase (不斷地想到碰撞著) literally translates to \"continuously thought of colliding.\" This is a likely typographical error for \"不斷地相互碰撞著\" (*búduànde xiānghù pèngzhuàngzhe*), meaning \"continuously colliding with each other.\"",

    "content": "\"Ling'er, Dual-Color Ice Sphere, quick!\" Lidai called out, a little urgently.\n\nLong Ling, who had been a bit sluggish, hurriedly began to chant, \"Great ice elements! Condense, transform into ancient glaciers, transform into solid moonlight ice, fusion of ice and ice, appear, Dual-Color Ice Sphere!\" A giant Dual-Color Ice Sphere appeared. Perhaps influenced by Nian Bing's magic control, Long Ling deliberately compressed the Ice Sphere to be even more solid. Although the spikes were a bit shorter, it looked much sturdier.\n\nNian Bing's eyes lit up, and he immediately understood Lidai's idea. In a true vortex, if there's only one object, it will continuously spin until the vortex swallows it. However, if this object encounters an immovable solid within the vortex, then, propelled by the vortex's immense impact force, it will easily shatter. At this moment, the Dual-Color Ice Sphere would be that solid. As for whether it would achieve a good effect, it depended on Long Ling's magic control.\n\nThe Ice Sphere flew into the vortex, and thirty Earth Dragons immediately crashed into it one after another. Under the immense propulsion of the vortex, the Ice Sphere quickly turned red. Although Long Ling couldn't make the Ice Sphere stay still, she could slow down its rotation with the water waves, and that was enough.\n\n\"Mercenaries, the rest are up to you.\" After the Ice Sphere crushed the twelfth Iron-Backed Earth Dragon, Lidai stopped the magic. After all, continuously using a large-area Sixth-Tier magic was by no means easy, even for an Archmage like him.\n\nThe dizzy Earth Dragons finally landed firmly on their feet. Zi Qingjian shouted loudly, \"Nian Bing, help me protect my sister!\" He was the first to charge out. His fighting style was extremely similar to Huarui's, immensely powerful. Definitely not inferior to Huarui. The Earth Dragons' tough scales offered little defense against his heavy sword. An Earth Dragon's head was already rolling on the ground.\n\nThe remaining nearly twenty Earth Dragons hadn't yet recovered from their dizziness. Nian Bing's eight mercenaries had already charged out, following Zi Qingjian. \"Sister Feng Nu, aren't you going?\" Zi Qingmeng, worried about her brother, asked Feng Nu beside her.\n\nFeng Nu smiled slightly. \"I don't like gore, and besides, there's no need for me to act right now.\"\n\nZi Qingjian's strength had already reached the Warrior level. Perhaps he didn't have as profound Battle Qi as Gatlin, but his innate strength and fearless momentum gave him a destructive power that couldn't be underestimated. Under his lead, four Earth Dragons were successively destroyed by the mercenaries. At this point, the dizzy Earth Dragons finally regained consciousness, and their huge claws combined with sword-toothed mouths caused considerable trouble for the mercenaries. Slaughtering Earth Dragons was by no means an easy task. Apart from Zi Qingjian, the other mercenaries could only strike the Earth Dragons' eyes to inflict fatal blows. However, the Earth Dragons seemed to have gotten smarter; even the Earth Dragons on Carlo's side were no longer so easy to harm.\n\nOf the remaining sixteen Earth Dragons, ten were besieging Zi Qingjian and his group, while the remaining five charged towards Nian Bing and his companions.\n\nFeng Nu glanced at Zi Qingmeng. She smiled wryly, \"It seems I really have to act now. Nian Bing, stop using magic; save some magic power.\" As soon as she spoke, her expression suddenly changed. Fiery red aura spread throughout her body, her face became exceptionally calm, and she charged directly at the five Earth Dragons.\n\nLong Ling exclaimed in surprise, \"Nian Bing, quickly use a scroll to help her! Directly confronting the Earth Dragons will lead to death!\" Gentle and kind as she was, if she hadn't been too late to chant a spell, she would have already acted herself. She knew that only Nian Bing could help Feng Nu now.\n\nNian Bing smiled and shook his head, saying, \"No need, just wait and see.\"\n\nThe red figure, like smoke, eerily passed through the center of the five Earth Dragons. Even with Nian Bing's eyesight, he only saw several flashes of silver light in quick succession. Her figure didn't stop but charged into the Earth Dragons fighting Zi Qingmeng and her group. At this point, Zi Qingmeng had already dealt with another one.\n\nThe five Earth Dragons were still frantically rushing towards Nian Bing and his group. Carlo, who had been constantly observing the situation, was about to come over to help but witnessed an eerie sight: as the five running Earth Dragons moved, parts of their bodies surprisingly fell off one by one. Blood and gore spread for a full ten meters. By the time they were thirty meters away from Nian Bing and the others, they had already turned into a pile of mangled flesh on the ground.\n\nLong Ling's face grew even paler, her hand gripping the magic staff trembled slightly. Zi Qingmeng murmured, \"She... didn't she say she doesn't like gore?\"\n\nNian Bing's lips twitched slightly. \"Yes, she doesn't like gore. Didn't you see? No blood stained her body.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng murmured, \"Father once said that a true Martial Saint can be equivalent to twenty Warriors. Since she just entered the Martial Saint realm, I guess she can be equivalent to ten, right? What terrifying power.\"\n\nAlthough Feng Nu's strength was formidable, achieving such an effect was also thanks to her Blade of Severing Heaven. With a treasure blade nearly at the Divine Artifact level, infused with Nine Separation Battle Qi, slicing through the Iron-Backed Earth Dragons' scales was no different from tearing a piece of paper.\n\nAt this moment, the battle on Zi Qingjian's side had ended. With Feng Nu's addition, the Earth Dragons faced nothing but death.\n\nCarlo's voice suddenly rang out, \"Nian Bing, be careful!\"\n\nWhen Nian Bing turned to look, he saw a giant Earth Dragon charging up from the side, rushing to collide with him. At this point, Zi Qingmeng was already stunned with fright, and Feng Yun also froze for a moment. Only Long Ling and Lidai reacted. Lidai pulled a magic scroll from his bosom. Long Ling's action, however, was very direct: she actually charged directly towards Nian Bing, turning her back to face the Earth Dragon that was already within ten meters.\n\n\"Ling'er!\" Nian Bing wasn't startled by the Earth Dragon, but by Long Ling. With a flick and a shake of his wrist, a mass of red light floated out.\n\nWith a thunderous boom, the Earth Dragon fell three meters away from Long Ling, its massive head already split in two. The broad, thick Blade of Righteous Sun was precisely cleaving its neck. As soon as the Earth Dragon appeared behind him, Nian Bing had already begun preparing. The same mistake, he would absolutely not make a second time. Perhaps low-tier magic couldn't injure the Earth Dragon. However, under the powerful explosive force of the Exploding Flame Spell, the Divine Artifact-grade Blade of Righteous Sun could easily cut into the Earth Dragon's hard skull. This was something he had realized from Feng Nu's use of the Blade of Severing Heaven. He had no Battle Qi, but he could use magic as a boost. His first experiment achieved excellent results.\n\nTaking a step forward, Nian Bing tightly pulled Long Ling into his embrace. \"Ling'er, Ling'er, why are you so foolish!\" Tightly embracing that soft, delicate body, Nian Bing could no longer control his emotions. Long Ling's silent devotion deeply touched his heart. He knew. In this life and this lifetime, he could absolutely never abandon the girl in his arms. A human heart, after all, is made of flesh. How could he not be moved when such a gentle and kind girl was willing to give her life for him?\n\nLong Ling's pretty face flushed slightly. Since Nian Bing's departure back then, it was the first time she felt at peace. Nestled in that warm embrace, tears dampened the front of Nian Bing's shirt.\n\nZi Qingmeng's cough startled the two. Long Ling hurriedly pushed Nian Bing away, her pretty face flushed, standing to the side and wiping away the lingering tears from the corners of her eyes.\n\nZi Qingmeng handed the Blade of Righteous Sun to Nian Bing, teasingly saying, \"Your chopping knife certainly has a wide range of uses. After slicing up Earth Dragons, you're not going to cook for us next, are you?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled wryly, \"This is just a temporary measure, don't worry, I'll definitely clean the Blade of Righteous Sun thoroughly. Ling'er, you can't do that again. I'll protect myself and you. Do you know how much it pained me just now?\"\n\nLong Ling's expression had returned to calm. \"Nian Bing, we're just ordinary friends. Don't say such things to me anymore.\" After speaking, she turned and walked towards her sedan chair.\n\nNian Bing froze for a moment, then quickly chased after her, taking Long Ling's hand. \"Ling'er, it was my fault before. If you're willing, I... I want to pursue you, is that okay?\" When feelings arrived, there was no escaping them. Nian Bing was rational, so he chose to face them. However, Long Ling's answer greatly surprised him.\n\n\"Of course not, Nian Bing. There's something I forgot to tell you. My Senior Brother Shi Jiu and I are already engaged.\" Long Ling pulled her hand free from Nian Bing's grasp and went to sit down in the sedan chair.\n\n\"What? You, you and Shi Jiu are already engaged? No, that's impossible. You must be lying to me, right?\" Nian Bing's expression was somewhat stunned.\n\nLong Ling glanced at him. \"Do I have a need to lie to you? Since you didn't want me, I would naturally choose someone who loves me.\"\n\nA bitter sensation stung Nian Bing's heart. He lowered his head and let out a heavy sigh. \"I'm sorry. Then, congratulations to you both.\" As soon as he finished speaking, a cold light suddenly gleamed in Nian Bing's eyes. He abruptly raised his head and walked step by step towards the Earth Dragons that Huarui and her group were dealing with. At this moment, there were still eight Earth Dragons over there entangled in battle with the mercenaries.\n\n\"Burn, endless flames!\" Nian Bing raised the Blade of Righteous Sun. The Sigh of the Fire God made him absorb the surrounding fire elements. \"Endless flames! Lend me your unquenchable fiery passion, ascend, Flame Cloak!\"\n\nFlame Cloak, a Fire-attribute Sixth-Tier Auxiliary Magic. After using this magic, any Fire-attribute magic below Sixth-Tier can be enhanced to near Seventh-Tier attack power. It is a magic used by Fire mages when casting spells beyond their usual capabilities. Intense flames rose around Nian Bing's body. The flames were not red, but a deep, profound blue.\n\n\"Great Fire God! Please allow me to borrow your left hand, to let the burning flames descend upon the human world, to extinguish all evil forces, to let the flames illuminate the earth, and to destroy all obstacles in my path. —Left Hand of the Fire God.\" Flames condensed above the Roar of the Fire God. The profound blue Left Hand of the Fire God appeared above Nian Bing.\n\n\"Tear everything to shreds!\" The Roar of the Fire God suddenly pointed forward. Nian Bing, with his dual attributes, now had a fire burning in his heart. He only wanted to kill, to kill relentlessly. With the Roar of the Fire God combined with the amplification of Flame Cloak, the Left Hand of the Fire God directly reached the Seventh-Tier level. The profound blue giant hand burst forth, seizing an Earth Dragon's head in one grasp.\n\nUnder extreme heat and burning, the Earth Dragon let out a piercing roar. With a boom, its head was actually crushed to dust by the Left Hand of the Fire God. The slaughter did not end. Nian Bing, as if in a frenzy, controlled the Left Hand of the Fire God to strike another Earth Dragon. The Earth Dragon's huge body was tossed up, profound blue flames covered its entire body, emitting a burnt, foul odor. These ordinary Earth Dragons were only twenty to thirty years old, far inferior to the Gold-Backed Earth Dragon King Nian Bing had encountered last time. The Earth Dragons burning in the flames rolled on the ground, but the inferno, seemingly from hell, would not extinguish.\n\n\"Kill, kill, kill.\" The Seventh-Tier Left Hand of the Fire God unleashed powerful attack force. The giant flame hand blasted the remaining Earth Dragons one by one, turning them into masses of raging fire. Magic power was rapidly consumed to sustain this magic, but Nian Bing paid no heed. Everyone was dumbfounded. They found that Nian Bing's eyes had turned bloodshot at some point.\n\nWhen the last Earth Dragon was blasted away, the Left Hand of the Fire God also disappeared simultaneously. It wasn't that Nian Bing wanted it to disappear, but because his magic power was no longer sufficient to support this Seventh-Tier magic. A sense of weakness continuously invaded Nian Bing's brain, yet he could only feel heartache, heartache for himself and for Long Ling.\n\n\"Nian Bing, are you alright?\" Feng Nu's concerned voice rang in Nian Bing's ear. It was her first time seeing Nian Bing so frenzied. He had abandoned Ice-Fire Coexistence, which saved the most magic power, and instead chose the most direct flame attack. This approach was completely uncharacteristic of him in the face of adversity.\n\nBreathing heavily, Nian Bing shook his head. \"I... I'm fine. Just wanted to vent a bit.\"\n\nThe mercenaries all gathered around at this point. Carlo's gaze towards the few mages and Feng Nu had completely changed. Out of nearly sixty Earth Dragons in total, more than half were eliminated by Nian Bing and his group. This had already proven their strength. If they had relied solely on the mercenaries, they might have won, but they would certainly have paid a heavy price. Carlo couldn't help but feel a little fortunate about his correct decision to invite Nian Bing and his friends to this operation.\n\n\"Guild Leader Carlo, everyone's tired. Let's rest here for a bit before continuing.\" Nian Bing stated calmly, then turned and walked away.\n\nCarlo was about to say something but was stopped by Feng Nu. \"Let him be alone for a while.\"\n\nCarlo respectfully said, \"I truly didn't expect Miss to be a Martial Saint. Carlo hopes you will forgive any past rudeness.\" The influence of a Martial Saint in the martial arts world is unparalleled. With such a Martial Saint in his mercenary group, Carlo's confidence, which had been shaken by the appearance of the Master-level Earth Dragon, had long since fully recovered.",

    "content": "Feng Nü smiled politely, saying, \"Guild Master, there's no need to be so polite. I haven't truly reached the Martial Saint realm yet. The future is uncertain, and I must be extra careful! Let everyone recover their strength first.\"\n\nCarlo nodded. \"Gatling, what are our casualties?\"\n\nGatling flashed, appearing beside Carlo, and said, \"Commander, we have seven lightly injured, no severe injuries, and no deaths. All are battle-ready. I truly didn't expect us to be able to completely wipe out sixty Iron-North Earth Dragons so easily. We owe much thanks to the mages and Miss Feng Nü for this.\"\n\nCarlo said, \"Everyone rest where you are, and try to recover your battle qi. Those not injured, stay vigilant in case of another magical beast attack. It's a shame about these Earth Dragons; if we could tame them, we'd be the first mercenary group to have Earth Dragon Knights.\"\n\nHua Yi's raspy voice rang out, \"What's a shame? It's good enough that we didn't become Earth Dragon dinner. If you want to catch Earth Dragons, they have to be strays, and only small ones can possibly be tamed. It's not that easy.\"\n\nCarlo smiled faintly. \"Indeed! I'm already very fortunate there were no casualties. Rui Rui, you should rest for a bit too; you exerted a lot of effort just now.\"\n\nNian Bing went alone to a corner of the hillside and sat down. The crazy attack just now had consumed nearly half of his magic power. Without hesitation, he immediately entered a meditation state, simultaneously multitasking and pondering Long Ling's earlier words.\n\nThis rest lasted a full hour. The injured mercenaries had all bandaged their wounds, recovered some strength, drank some water, and rested. The appearance of the Earth Dragons not only didn't dampen their morale but instead greatly boosted the entire mercenary group's spirits. After all, Iron-North Earth Dragons were quite famous on the Yangguang Continent, always sought by various nations as the best mounts due to their strong defense and powerful charges. Unfortunately, until now, no country had been known to organize an Earth Dragon Knight Legion. This time, sixty Earth Dragons were wiped out in one go. Coupled with the powerful strength displayed by Feng Nü, Nian Bing, and others, the mercenaries' confidence grew even stronger, and their cohesion increased.\n\nWhen Nian Bing returned to the mercenaries, a smile had reappeared on his face. As a rational person, he would never let worries follow him for too long; thinking through an issue and judging its pros and cons was not difficult for him. He walked directly to Long Ling's side and whispered, \"Long Ling. There might still be unknown dangers ahead. You must be careful. Don't get hurt because of momentary soft-heartedness. Promise me, okay?\"\n\nLong Ling had previously told Nian Bing about her engagement to Shi Jiu, and she felt absolutely awful about it. For some reason, when Nian Bing was taking it out on the Earth Dragons, a hint of satisfaction also arose in her heart. Now, seeing Nian Bing recover so quickly, a sense of loss once again filled her heart. She nodded lightly, indicating she understood.\n\n\"As for us, let's talk after this mission is complete, okay? Don't make yourself miserable; be happy.\" After saying this, Nian Bing returned to his stretcher and began discussing the route forward with Carlo.\n\nWatching Nian Bing's back, Long Ling's heart trembled for some unknown reason. Reason told her not to approach Nian Bing again, but Nian Bing's last words inexplicably gave her a feeling of trust. What did he mean?\n\n\"Guild Master Carlo, what do you think about the Earth Dragon attack?\" Nian Bing asked calmly.\n\nCarlo frowned slightly. \"It's very likely they were manipulated by the enemy. Earth Dragons are naturally solitary magical beasts, so it's too strange for so many to gather at once. And for them to attack us in two waves, that's even stranger. So, I think this must have been planned by the enemies who ambushed us the other day.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"I think so too. Therefore, we must be even more careful in our next actions. The enemy is definitely stronger than we imagined. If we truly can't handle them, I hope you can make a decisive decision and give the order to retreat. Life is the most precious thing; sacrificing it for wealth and restoration is absolutely an unwise choice.\"\n\nCarlo's expression shifted. After a long moment, he nodded with difficulty. \"Perhaps you're right. If you hadn't joined us, our mission this time would probably have already failed.\"\n\nDeep within the Heaven-Swaying Mountains.\n\n\"Bastard, who told you to take the Earth Dragon Legion to attack those humans?\"\n\n\"Well, Elder, those Earth Dragons are stupid to death, and they often attack other creatures in the mountains. What's the use of keeping them? I thought those humans must have died in the Earth Dragons' mouths. With their strength, they only deserved to be Earth Dragon lunch.\"\n\n\"Hmph, Luoyi, how many times have I told you, humans must never be underestimated. Although Iron-North Earth Dragons only possess a very small amount of dragon bloodline, they are, after all, related to dragons by blood. If the Dragon Lord blames us for what you've done, who will bear the responsibility? To be frank with you, I can no longer sense the aura of the Earth Dragons you sent out.\"\n\n\"What? Impossible! How could those humans be so strong? Sixty-plus Earth Dragons, even we wouldn't find them easy to deal with.\"\n\n\"Have you forgotten what I just said? Humans who dare to covet the Dragon Lord's treasure, how could they brazenly enter our Heaven-Swaying Mountains without a certain level of strength? Your back injury hasn't healed that quickly, has it? Go prepare, it's time for us to welcome our guests.\"\n\n\"Elder, I know I was wrong. But rest assured, with our clan's strength, we can certainly keep all these humans here. No matter how powerful they are, they cannot contend with the Dragon Lord.\"\n\n\"Impudent! The Dragon Lord must absolutely not be disturbed. Have you forgotten how the Dragon Lord reacted last time when he was woken from his sleep?\"\n\n\"Ah! Elder, I'm sorry, I'll go right away.\"\n\nThe Ice Moon Mercenary Group set out again. After crossing a mountain, they were shocked to discover that everything before them had completely changed.\n\nWinter's chill was completely gone here, replaced only by a warm spring ambiance. Looking around, the not-so-tall mountains before them were entirely covered in green, and the temperature was much warmer than on the other side of the mountain they had just crossed. The fresh air brought by the plants was invigorating, and even a faint floral scent wafted continuously. Various animals moved through the forest; the chirping of insects and birdsong were clearly discernible. There was even the gurgling of a stream emanating from deep within the forest. Where was the sense of crisis here? It was a scene straight out of a paradise! The stark contrast between before and after made the mercenaries halt their advance. Now, they finally understood why no animals were seen in the barren mountains.\n\nNian Bing sniffed, and calmly said, \"This is the aura of fire. For such a strange scene to appear in the dead of winter, it can only prove this place's unique nature. Teacher Lidda. Do you sense it? The fire magic elements are particularly active here, while other elemental magic elements are much weaker.\"\n\nLidda nodded, frowning. \"Could it be because of the treasure? If there's a master-level fire attribute gemstone mine here, such weather changes could occur.\"\n\nUpon hearing \"fire attribute gemstone mine,\" all the mercenaries' eyes lit up. How many fire attribute gemstones would it take to make several mountains as warm as spring? If it truly was a mine, it could absolutely rival an empire's wealth.\n\nNian Bing shook his head. \"It can't be that lucky. Unless an entire mountain here is one solid block of fire attribute gemstones. And if it were gemstones, how could the plants grow so well? There must be something fishy going on. Guild Master Carlo. Don't forget what I said earlier.\"\n\nCarlo nodded. \"Let's go. Although enemies exist, we still have a chance.\"\n\nThe mercenary group descended the mountain. The warmth made them shed their thick clothes, and they moved much more lightly. Nian Bing projected his spiritual energy outwards, constantly observing the surroundings, trying to detect the enemy's presence. Since enemies had already warned them that day, someone would surely appear now to stop them from advancing further.\n\nHowever, the Ice Moon Mercenary Group's advance was much easier than imagined. Not only was there no trace of the enemy, but even the wild beasts in the forest avoided them. No difficulties arose. Sitting on the stretcher, enjoying the beautiful scenery around him, Nian Bing's previously tense heart relaxed a little.\n\nThe closer they got to the target, the higher the surrounding temperature became. By the time they could see the tall mountain where their objective lay, the environment around them was no different from summer. Carlo made a decisive decision: to lighten their burden, he had everyone leave behind their heavy clothes, and then they proceeded lightly.\n\nAt Carlo's signal, Gatling sprang into the air, lightly tapping the tip of his foot on a large tree ahead. His body soared again, already above the tree canopy. He leveraged himself a second time on the treetop, launching himself nearly eight zhang (approx. 26 meters) into the high sky.\n\nWatching Gatling's powerful agility technique, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a little envious. Warriors truly had incomparable advantages over mages in certain aspects!\n\nHis body, floating in the air, slowly descended like a leaf. At this moment, Gatling's cold face showed a hint of excitement. \"Commander, I see it. At the foot of the mountain ahead, there's a very large cave. It's easily visible from outside, and there seems to be no enemy guarding it.\"\n\nA glint flashed in Carlo's eyes. \"This seems a bit too smooth. Everyone, do not let down your guard. Let's go.\"\n\nThey descended the mountain, and when they emerged from a dense forest, they finally saw the cave Gatling had mentioned. The cave was indeed very large, its entrance easily over ten zhang (approx. 33 meters) in diameter. It was pitch black inside, and nothing could be seen clearly. Carlo took out the treasure map and carefully compared it. That's right, this cave was indeed the location of the treasure.\n\nCarlo lunged to the cave entrance in a single stride, looked around, and urgently called out, \"Assign four people to guard the entrance; the others protect the mages and enter the cave. Move quickly!\"\n\n\"No, there's no need. Having come here, your lives have also reached their end.\" A deep, ancient voice rang out. The surrounding air suddenly became exceptionally scorching. In the forest outside the cave, and above the cave entrance, agile figures continuously emerged. The figures were entirely fiery red. Carlo felt a huge pressure coming from overhead. Subconsciously, he took a step back, swiftly retreated, and rejoined his mercenary ranks. What was bound to come had finally arrived, and this was clearly a trap, specifically designed to await him and his group.\n\nBoth sides eyed each other. Carlo's mercenary group had always been in the open, while their opponents had always been hidden. Now that they met face-to-face, Carlo couldn't help but gasp. Were they even human?\n\nThere were hundreds of these red figures before them, already surrounding the mercenaries from all directions. These people shared very similar appearances; their builds were exactly like humans, with no differences. However, their skin easily distinguished them from humans. To be precise, these suddenly appearing enemies had no exposed skin at all; their bodies were entirely covered by a layer of fine, dark red scales. They wore only coarse cloth garments that covered their vital areas. Under the sunlight filtering through the trees, the scales reflected a dark red sheen, and the sudden rise in temperature seemed to be caused by their presence.\n\nLooking at the three tall scaled figures in front, Carlo said in a deep voice, \"We have no intention of troubling you. We only want what's inside this cave. Can we reach an understanding?\"\n\nThe central scaled person appeared aged and said indifferently, \"That is impossible. Within this cave dwelling lives our most venerable Dragon Lord. Forget entering; merely having seen our kin, you can no longer leave this place alive. If you are willing to commit suicide, I can spare your lives. Killing you despicable humans would only stain my hands.\"\n\nCarlo's gaze swept around. All the scaled people appeared very calm. The tips of their fingers had sharp, claw-like extensions. Cold gazes were fixed on him and his group. Carlo continuously tried to calm his inner tension. He knew that if every scaled person present was as powerful as the two who ambushed them earlier, they might not even have a chance to escape today.\n\nJust as Carlo was at a loss for how to respond to the current situation, Nian Bing spoke up, \"Hello, old sir. We came here because we obtained a treasure map. We have no hostility towards your noble clan, nor did we know that it was your private property. If you are unwilling to let us have those treasures, we can simply leave. Why must we harm our cordiality?\"\n\n\"Leave? So you can leave and then lead a large group of humans to disturb the Dragon Lord's rest? That's impossible. If you don't commit suicide, you can just die.\" Saying this, he raised his hand, about to order the strange scaled people to attack.\n\nNian Bing and Feng Nü exchanged glances. He suddenly remembered what Shirard had once told him and exclaimed, \"Are you Dragonkin? Are you the Dragonkin who guard the Giant Dragon?\"",

    "content": "The originally silent group of Dragonkin immediately stirred upon hearing Nian Bing utter the words \"Dragonkin Race.\" The elder at the very front slightly furrowed his brow, \"You know us?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"I've heard of the Dragonkin Race's existence before. So, in that case, the treasure you guard must be a dragon's treasure.\"\n\n\"Correct, we are indeed the Fire Dragon Race. I can also tell you that I am Jin Ni, the sole surviving elder of the Fire Dragon Race. Even knowing this is useless; today you must die. The dignity of the Dragonkin Race cannot be violated. Kill!\"\n\n\"Go forth, Water Dance Billows.\" An aged voice rang out, and a circle of blue light suddenly manifested as a giant halo spreading outwards, directly meeting the charging Fire Dragon clansmen. It turned out that Nian Bing's initiative to talk to the opponents was at Li Da's behest, to buy more time for him to chant spells. The opponents had no intention of letting them go, so a direct confrontation was the only option left.\n\nWater Dance Billows, an eighth-tier large-area attack water magic, was a spell that consumed an extreme amount of mana, but in the current situation facing a large number of enemies, it was clearly the best choice. Unfortunately, within the Fire Dragon Race's territory, the power of water magic was greatly reduced; an eighth-tier spell could only unleash seventh-tier power.\n\nWater waves spread out like billows, carrying rapid water arrows that blocked the charge of the Fire Dragon clansmen. Red battle qi flew around, resisting the continuous impact of Water Dance Billows. Feng Nü suddenly shouted, \"Charge into the cave! We can defend better there.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes lit up, \"Right!\" Advancing as a retreat. Before Carlo, Gatlin, and Huarui rushed towards the cave entrance, he was the first to throw out two magic scrolls. These were his ultimate life-saving moves.\n\nIce and fire, two of the strongest sixth-tier magic scrolls Nian Bing could create, instantly exploded. Red and blue lights collided with great force, and the violent boom seemed to shake the entire mountain range. Under Nian Bing's full activation, the Ice and Fire Synergy unleashed a massive eighth-tier impact, centered on the opposing elder.\n\nThe magical impact was entirely one-sided. The Fire Dragon elder's expression changed slightly when he heard Feng Nü's shout. Silver battle qi covered his entire body. Pushing his hands forward, just as he was about to break Li Da's magic, Nian Bing's scroll-launched attack arrived.\n\nEighth-tier attack magic could not threaten a Martial Saint-level warrior, let alone the formidable bodies of the Fire Dragon clansmen, which were incomparable to ordinary people. Amidst the huge shock, the Fire Dragon elder only took a step back and stabilized himself, while the more than ten Fire Dragon clansmen originally beside him were flung into the air by the sudden magic. They seemed to fear the large cave behind them, preferring to be injured by the magical impact rather than retreat, barely controlling their bodies to fly diagonally. This left only the Fire Dragon elder alone in front of the cave entrance. Just then, Huarui's pair of giant wheel battle axes arrived.\n\n*Clang, clang* - amidst two clear sounds, Huarui spat blood and flew back. Her battle axes actually had two marks bounced into them by the opponent. Carlo and Gatlin were knocked back at a speed not much slower than hers, and a Martial Artist had no chance against a true Martial Saint. The Fire Dragon elder was clearly enraged. The silver battle qi on his body completely swelled, having been attacked consecutively by magic and three Martial Artists with their full power. Formidable as he was, he couldn't help but feel his vital energy churn.\n\nThe mercenaries, spurred by Feng Nü's words, had already charged forward with all their might. At this moment, what attacked first was a streak of red light. When the red light reached three feet in front of the Fire Dragon elder Jin Ni, the red light suddenly turned silver. A clear phoenix cry rang out at the opportune moment. The silver sword shadow was so elusive in Jin Ni's eyes that his expression changed slightly. Jin Ni simultaneously thrust out both fists, and holy battle qi surged forth, striking the sword curtain like a physical entity.\n\n\"Phoenix—Plume—Slash—.\" A sound like tearing silk rang out. Also silver battle qi, the sword curtain suddenly solidified into one, forcibly cleaving the battle qi Jin Ni had released, its trailing flame heading straight for Jin Ni's chest.\n\n\"Are you really seeking death?\" Jin Ni roared in anger, his body suddenly shot upwards, letting out a dragon roar, dodging the sword light, and attacking Feng Nü who had charged to his previous position.\n\nFeng Nü's gaze was exceptionally calm. She let out a clear, high-pitched phoenix cry, and the silver battle qi around her body instantly expanded a few points. \"Phoenix—Dance—of—Nine—Heavens—.\" The Separation Divine Sword in her hand suddenly slowed down. With a simple upward flick, her figure gracefully danced along with the divine sword.\n\nJin Ni's expression changed dramatically. Although his battle qi surpassed Feng Nü's, facing strong enemies one after another, coupled with the Separation Divine Sword in Feng Nü's hand, he no longer felt confident in achieving balance. He swung his hands strangely in the air, trying to find the flat of the Separation Divine Sword to unleash his battle qi, but Feng Nü gave him no such opportunity. Phoenix Dance of Nine Heavens fully demonstrated its peculiar nature, forcing Jin Ni to unleash his battle qi outside his body for another hard clash.\n\nA flash of blood appeared. Scales scattered from Jin Ni's left chest, leaving a half-inch deep, half-foot long wound. Blood flowed out, making the scales on his body appear even more vibrant. His body was knocked flying, landing outside the cave entrance. Although no expression could be seen on his scale-covered face, Nian Bing noticed a hint of panic in his eyes. He clearly hadn't suffered a loss, so why was he panicking?\n\nAt this moment, Li Da's magic finally concluded under the frantic assault of a large amount of fire-attribute battle qi. Fortunately, Feng Yun timely used a sixth-tier earth magic, coupled with Long Ling's large-area Ice Blade Slash, which helped the mercenaries temporarily withstand the Fire Dragon clansmen's attacks. The Fire Dragon warriors' attack power was extremely formidable; at least all of them possessed the strength of a Great Swordsman, and there were also Martial Artists among them. The three knocked-back individuals, Carlo, barely suppressed their injuries and desperately helped their subordinates, only then managing to barely restrain the opponent's charge, preventing the mercenaries' formation from being disrupted. Even so, most of the mercenaries had already sustained injuries.\n\nFeng Nü urgently cried out, \"Quick, get into the cave.\"\n\nNian Bing also went all out at this point, enduring the pain to throw out four precious magic scrolls. It was also Ice and Fire Synergy, but this time it was a combination of five-element magic. Four scrolls combined to form two powerful spells, but this time it wasn't a single attack, but a double one, because each scroll was formed by fusion magic, the subtlety of its changes was breathtaking.\n\nIn an instant, four intertwined red and blue flowers bloomed in the center of the Fire Dragon warriors, their brilliant light eclipsing even the sunlight. The fierce explosions completely suppressed the attacks of those Fire Dragon warriors. But Nian Bing was astonished to discover that even powerful seventh-tier attack magic could at most injure these scale-armored monsters, but couldn't truly take their lives.\n\nHowever, utilizing the four bursts of magical impact, the mercenaries swiftly charged into the cave. The strongest among them, led by Carlo, Feng Nü, and others, guarded the cave entrance, continuing to fight the charging Fire Dragon warriors. After entering the cave, they at least temporarily had no worries about their rear. Although the enemies were numerous, they could only charge in waves.\n\nKnocking Jin Ni back with a single sword strike, Feng Nü said in a deep voice, \"Elder Jin, have your clansmen retreat. You should see that I haven't aimed to kill; I simply don't wish to make things difficult for your esteemed race. Why must you relentlessly force a military confrontation? Wouldn't it suffice for us to withdraw from the Tiandang Mountains and keep your secret?\"\n\nJin Ni angrily said, \"Your audacity to enter the Dragon Lord's Fire Dragon Cave is the greatest insult to our Fire Dragon clansmen! Only blood can wash away this disgrace. If you are still warriors with dignity, come out of the cave and engage us in a righteous decisive battle.\"\n\nA fireball and an ice ball collided in the air, pushing back the Fire Dragon clansmen once more. Carlo's voice came from behind Feng Nü, \"We are just mercenaries, not warriors. If you've got the ability, then charge in. Get surrounded by you outside? Unless we're fools. Everyone hold your ground; whether we live to return depends on us.\"\n\nJin Ni, furious, laughed instead, \"Fine, I'd like to see how long you can hold out. Kill them! Archers, climb the trees! Destroy those mages first!\" He had already realized that it would be difficult to break through the opponent's defenses without killing their mages first.\n\nOn the Yangguang Continent, just as Xilade had told Nian Bing before, some humans formed the Dragonkin Race, taking dragons as their totems. These Dragonkin were further divided into several categories based on the dragon species they revered. The Fire Dragonkin in front of them were one such branch. The Ice Moon Mercenary Group's luck was rather good; although the Fire Dragonkin were powerful, they were much weaker compared to some other Dragonkin races, evident from the fact that they only had one Dragonkin elder at the Martial Saint realm.\n\nDozens of Fire Dragonkin had already climbed the large trees outside the cave entrance, pulling back their stiff bows, threatening the mercenaries inside.\n\nJin Ni glared at Feng Nü and said, \"The Phoenix Race and our Dragonkin Race have always kept to their own affairs. If you leave now, I can let you go.\"\n\nFeng Nü said in a deep voice, \"Then please let us all go. My promise just now is absolutely valid. If anyone leaks the whereabouts of the Dragonkin Race after leaving here, I will take responsibility for enforcing justice on behalf of the Dragonkin Race, how about that?\"\n\nJin Ni snorted coldly, \"Do you take this place for a human city? Come as you please, leave as you please. I don't mind being an enemy of the Phoenix Race. Since you are so stubborn, don't blame me for being impolite.\" As he spoke, he waved his hand forward, and the Fire Dragonkin warriors launched another fierce assault.\n\nA piercing shriek rang out. Arrows of fire, like meteors, rained down from the treetops, flying over the defending mercenaries and heading straight for Nian Bing and the other three. Those were sharp arrows launched with fire-attribute battle qi. Nian Bing and the others' bodies simply couldn't withstand them.\n\n\"Water Curtain Connecting Heaven.\" Li Da, the only Archmage, displayed formidable magical power. A blue light curtain lit up, not only completely neutralizing the fire arrows, but also forcing back the Fire Dragonkin warriors charging towards the mercenaries a few steps, weakening their impact on the mercenaries.\n\nJin Ni did not re-enter the battle, merely watching the enemies in front of him, commanding his clansmen to attack relentlessly.\n\nThis cave entrance was indeed too large; at least half of the mercenaries were needed to completely block it. And the Fire Dragonkin warriors at the very front all possessed the strength of Martial Artists. If not for the magical support from Nian Bing and others, plus the mercenaries unleashing one hundred and twenty percent of their strength to preserve their lives, their defense line would likely have been breached long ago.\n\n\"Feng Yun, use Earth Extension Spell to narrow the cave entrance,\" Nian Bing said urgently. At this point, the narrower the cave entrance, the better it would be for Nian Bing and the others. After all, there weren't many powerhouses in their mercenary group. If it were narrower, with Feng Nü and a few Martial Artist-level masters holding the front, and magic support from behind, they could at least hold out for a while without issue.\n\nFeng Yun gave a bitter smile, \"I've tried, but this mountain's structure is very special. The earth element is extremely inert and very solid; it simply can't be extended or moved!\"\n\nNian Bing sighed inwardly. He knew that under the current circumstances, trying to charge out was undoubtedly a pipe dream. \"Feng Nü, stop holding back. Otherwise, we'll all die here. One less killed means one less for us to face.\"\n\nA glint flashed in Feng Nü's eyes, and her aura instantly changed. Jin Ni also noticed this and swiftly charged forward before Feng Nü could deliver a killing blow. Relying on his formidable holy battle qi, he fought Feng Nü. He had the advantage in battle qi, while Feng Nü had the Separation Divine Sword. The two fought, and the situation was temporarily a stalemate.\n\nA gentle breeze continuously rustled the leaves, creating a soft murmur. The foot of the mountain, with its fresh air, should have been a haven, but at this moment, a fierce battle was taking place. Warriors at the Great Swordsman realm, no matter how desperately they fought, could not defeat Martial Artists. The mercenaries' wounds continuously increased. Long Ling could no longer bother attacking enemies; she put all her attention on healing the mercenaries. Having lost control over the earth, Feng Yun, the great earth-element mage, was effectively useless now. He could only watch the battle in front of him. Suddenly, a thought struck him, and he turned to run deeper into the cave. At this moment, everyone's attention was focused on the battle; no one noticed him.\n\nLi Da's responsibility was heavy; he had to defend against projectiles flying down from the treetops outside. This required long-term magical support. Although he was an Archmage, facing the attacks of so many warriors, the time he could sustain was continuously decreasing.\n\nAmong all four mages, Nian Bing was now the only one who could provide offensive support. Since leaving the Peach Blossom Forest, it was the first time he had spared no effort, using all of his abilities. Holding the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God in reverse grip with both hands, relying on these two divine-artifact-level treasures, he greatly saved on his mana consumption. With Ice and Fire Synergy pushed to its limit, red and blue lights repeatedly blasted back the Fire Dragonkin warriors' advance. It was precisely due to his full display of power that Long Ling had the opportunity to heal the substituted wounded.",

    "content": "With a deafening boom, Feng Nü stumbled back three steps. Her silver battle qi reverted to dark red, and a trickle of blood flowed from the corner of her mouth. She had already sustained a serious injury. And that Fire Dragon-human Elder Jin Ni was certainly not feeling well either; several more crisscrossing wounds appeared on his body, with blood continuously flowing out. Although he himself possessed a fire constitution, the feeling of the Nine Departures Battle Qi, unleashed through the Departing Heaven Divine Sword, invading his body was absolutely unbearable.\n\n\"Ah!\" Jin Ni roared. His seemingly aged body suddenly swelled by a circle, and his aura intensified greatly. He violently threw a punch remotely towards Feng Nü; the silver battle qi condensed into a ball, rushing rapidly towards Feng Nü like a cannonball.\n\nFeng Nü's expression subtly changed. Her battle qi at this moment could no longer reach the Saint Battle Qi realm. Holding her sword with both hands, she could only rely on the advantage of the Departing Heaven Divine Sword now, striving to cleave open this heavy battle qi projectile. However, she had no confidence whatsoever now.\n\n\"No one is allowed to harm Feng Nü. Roar----\" A tall figure suddenly sprang out from the side. His massive heavy sword struck the silver battle qi projectile with a thud. The intense battle qi explosion caused several surrounding Dragon-human warriors to stumble back. The one who suddenly appeared and blocked this attack for Feng Nü was actually Zi Qingjian.\n\nZi Qingjian's body now showed obvious changes. His disheveled hair had turned blood red, his already tall body had swelled by a circle, and his heavy breathing was like that of an Iron-backed Earth Dragon. Swollen blood vessels were clearly visible on his body. Having met a Saint Battle Qi attack, he merely sank his feet into the ground, not retreating in the slightest.\n\nJin Ni, who had elevated his battle qi to its strongest level, said in surprise: \"Berserker? There's actually still a Berserker?\"\n\nNo one answered his question. Zi Qingjian walked out alone from among the mercenaries at the cave entrance. His eyes had already turned blood red. In his blurred consciousness, only a few familiar names remained. A brilliant blue light erupted from his massive heavy sword. The three-foot long sword light, in terms of aura, was not weaker than Jin Ni's in the slightest.\n\nFour Fire Dragon-human warriors rushed towards Zi Qingjian from different directions. The heavy sword in Zi Qingjian's hand was like dry grass. Without any fancy moves, it swept around his body once. Immediately, a blue light sealed off the area like a wall.\n\nThe four figures retreated even faster than they had arrived. However, this time they were sent flying by shockwaves. Amidst torrents of gushing blood, the four Dragon-human warriors had already suffered heavy injuries. Although their Dragon-human constitution prevented them from being killed, they had already been robbed of their combat ability<sup>1</sup>.\n\nZi Qingjian stood there<sup>2</sup>. His red hair, red eyes, coupled with the unstable blue light radiating from his entire body, made him like a demon god. Both sides who were fighting stopped. For a moment, he became the focus of attention.\n\nLi Ta's magic ceased. He was gasping for air in large gulps. His pale face showed his current weak state. He sat down heavily on the ground, not daring to meditate, and could only pull out a few of his bottom-of-the-box magic scrolls<sup>3</sup>.\n\nNian Bing came to Feng Nü's side. Immediately, he transformed ice into water and cast a healing spell on Feng Nü, helping her recover from her shock-injured meridians. \"Brother Qingjian, what's wrong with him? He seems a bit muddled, I'll go call him back.\"\n\n\"No.\" Feng Nü stopped Nian Bing. \"No one can stop him now, he has gone berserk.\"\n\n\"Berserk?\" Nian Bing heard this term for the first time. \"What does 'berserk' mean?\"\n\nFeng Nü whispered: \"This is a special constitution, one in ten thousand among ordinary people, and especially after the Ancient War, it was thought to have died out. Warriors who have gone berserk are called Berserkers. They were once humanity's strongest military unit, and also the most difficult to control. Because although a berserk warrior becomes the strongest among all warriors in terms of individual combat ability, they also have a huge flaw, which is that their consciousness, like their body, falls into madness. In this state, they can no longer distinguish friend from foe. Their own magical power is raised to its limit, their skin becomes as hard as iron, and if they have cultivated battle qi, their battle qi will increase manifold. A berserk Berserker only knows how to attack until all their physical strength is exhausted. After each berserk transformation, the Berserker must unavoidably sleep for three days. I really didn't expect your friend to be a Berserker. It seems we still have a chance. With his Martial Fighter's strength and then going berserk, even a Martial Saint cannot easily defeat him. I originally didn't want to kill, but now it seems I must act.\"\n\n\"Feng Nü, I know you have reservations. If you really don't want to kill, then you can beat those Fire Dragon-humans until they are robbed of their combat ability. As long as we can leave here safely, that will be enough.\"\n\nFeng Nü nodded and said: \"The moment Zi Qingjian moves, you all attack with full force. As long as he or I can pin down the opposing elder, we still have a chance.\"\n\n\"Kill----\" Zi Qingjian roared in fury. The most important enemy in his eyes was naturally Jin Ni. Subconsciously, the most important people to him were undoubtedly his sister and Feng Nü. And it was Jin Ni who had just harmed Feng Nü. At this moment, he suddenly erupted, naturally making Jin Ni his primary target.\n\nHis heavy sword raised high, Zi Qingjian, although he had fallen into a berserk state, hadn't forgotten any of his abilities; instead, he used them even more fluidly. The movement technique Zi Qingmeng had used against Feng Nü now appeared on him, phantoms of several figures rushing towards the Martial Saint-level Jin Ni.\n\nFeng Nü was just about to move when she suddenly saw a black ray of light descending from the sky. With no reflection of light, it went straight for Long Ling, who was treating the mercenaries. She no longer cared where this ray of light came from. Her figure flickered, and she arrived beside Long Ling. With her Departing Heaven Divine Sword, she flicked upwards, sending the black ray of light flying aside.\n\nWith a soft clang, it turned out to be a black needle. A faint metallic scent spread through the air, indicating that the needle carried a potent poison.\n\n\"Ah! Why did you save me?\" Long Ling only now came to her senses. She couldn't help but be a little stunned as she looked at Feng Nü.\n\nFeng Nü's sharp gaze swept towards the direction the black needle had come from. It was a dense mountain forest, where no energy fluctuations could be found. This was definitely not an attack from the Fire Dragon-human race; as a proud lineage of Dragon-humans, they would never use poison. While searching for hidden enemies, she subconsciously replied: \"Nian Bing asked me to protect you. You don't need to thank me; if you want to thank anyone, go thank him directly. Be careful yourself, there might be additional enemies.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I will be careful.\" Long Ling's voice was calm, showing no change whatsoever due to her life being threatened. She continued treating the mercenaries.\n\nKaluo had also heard Feng Nü's previous words with Nian Bing. The moment Zi Qingjian moved, he immediately led the mercenaries in a counterattack against the Dragon-humans. He understood that as long as Feng Nü could perform normally, even though the enemy was numerous, there was still a chance to break through.\n\nThe berserk Zi Qingjian was indeed as Feng Nü had said. The power he unleashed by completely burning his own magical energy meant that even a strong individual like Jin Ni was temporarily utterly helpless against him. And at this moment, he could not evade Zi Qingjian; otherwise, it would surely be his clansmen who suffered. Although the Dragon-human race's innate defense was strong, such violent battle qi, when directly hit, was still enough to be fatal.\n\nThe scene completely descended into chaos. Feng Nü finally displayed her might. The Departing Heaven Divine Sword, propelled by her graceful figure, conjured countless sword lights. Each sword light was like a venomous snake flicking its tongue. Sword lights flickered; one Fire Dragon-human warrior after another was struck and fell to the ground. In a short while, over ten Fire Dragon-human warriors had been robbed of their combat ability<sup>1</sup>.\n\nUnder the suddenly reduced pressure, the mercenaries fought with all their might, unleashing their battle qi to its absolute limit. They charged towards the Fire Dragon-humans under the leadership of Kaluo, Jiatelin, and Huarui.\n\nSuddenly, countless red rays of light scattered from the air, with only one target: Feng Nü. The red lights coordinated with extreme precision, blocking all of Feng Nü's advancing routes, forcing her to stop and use the Departing Heaven Divine Sword to fend off the attack of the battle qi arrows. The Fire Dragon-human warriors also used this opportunity to reorganize and charge forward, completely pushing the mercenaries back to the cave entrance. At this moment, Feng Nü, like Zi Qingjian, had been isolated on the periphery.\n\nNian Bing cast several spells to stabilize the situation, pulling Zi Qingmeng back to Long Ling's side. Just then, a sudden change occurred outside. Jin Ni's entire body erupted with battle qi. He sent Zi Qingjian flying back with a single punch and roared: \"Fire Dragon Soaring Cloud Formation.\"\n\nAll Fire Dragon-human warriors who were attacking suddenly retreated. Hundreds of them surprisingly formed a strange formation. Among them, eighteen elite Fire Dragon-human warriors surrounded Feng Nü, and led by a long-legged Fire Dragon-human beauty, they attacked Feng Nü. And another eighteen organized into a formation surrounding Zi Qingjian; they only skirmished with Zi Qingjian, avoiding direct confrontation, clearly intending to wear down his physical strength.\n\nThe Fire Dragon clansmen quickly busied themselves. The warriors who had previously been robbed of their combat ability<sup>1</sup> were all carried aside by their clansmen. Jin Ni's entire body erupted with radiant splendor. Surrounded by his clansmen, he walked step by step towards the cave entrance. \"Bow,\" a clansman handed a bow into his hand. The other Fire Dragon warriors formed teams of eighteen, slowly pressing towards the cave entrance.\n\nAlthough there were no enemy attacks, and the pressure on them had greatly lessened, the mercenaries' hearts were incredibly heavy now. They never expected that the moment they had a chance, it would be strangled in the cradle.\n\nFeng Nü no longer had the ability to use Saint Battle Qi at this moment. Although her speed and attack power were formidable, the formation formed by the eighteen-member teams of Fire Dragon-human warriors was very strange. No matter which direction she attacked, she invariably had to face nine opponents simultaneously. For a time, she dashed left and right, yet couldn't break out of the dark encirclement.\n\nJin Ni did not order his clansmen to attack the mercenaries. Holding a longbow, his sharp gaze fixed on Nian Bing. He had already discovered that this young man, who continuously cast spells, was the source of the mercenaries' ability to hold on. As long as he first destroyed a few mages, the situation would immediately become clear.\n\nA brilliant light erupted in Jin Ni's eyes. Holding the longbow, the bowstring instantly stretched. Silver Saint Battle Qi enveloped the entire great bow. A strange scene appeared: silver battle qi continuously formed at his bow-drawing right hand, actually transforming purely into a sharp arrow made of battle qi. \"Dragon---Guiding---Arrow---.\" The radiant silver light suddenly burst forth. Nian Bing only felt a tightening in his chest. The arrow hadn't even arrived, but his body already had an intense sensation. Without any hesitation, Nian Bing decisively activated his most powerful defensive Two-Color Ice Seal Sphere, directly meeting the arrow. The mercenaries weren't idle either. Kaluo, Jiatelin, and Huarui successively leaped up, intending to block the arrow. However, that arrow, formed by Saint Battle Qi, cut a beautiful arc through the opening, directly bypassing their obstruction. Its target was still Nian Bing.\n\nCould the Two-Color Ice Seal Sphere block the Saint Qi Arrow? The answer was no. Amidst a deafening roar, the Two-Color Ice Seal Sphere was shattered into countless ice shards by the violent battle qi. The silver light passed straight through and had already arrived within ten meters of Nian Bing. \"Be careful.\" Zi Qingmeng slid forward. Blue battle qi burst forth, preparing to block this arrow for Nian Bing. The greatest advantage of the Verdant Curtain Serene Blade Technique was speed; a fan-shaped blue light screen completely blocked Nian Bing's body. However, this was still not enough. With a soft clang, the Verdant Curtain Serene vanished. Zi Qingmeng tightly gripped her short blade; her bewitching body was sent flying in response. She was only sent flying after merely striking the side of the sharp arrow. Blood flowed from the corner of her mouth, and a look of despair appeared in her beautiful eyes.\n\n\"No!\" Long Ling threw herself sideways, blocking in front of Nian Bing. Her gaze was panicked, but not because of the impending battle qi arrow, but because of Nian Bing's safety. Her entire body trembled, and Long Ling suddenly found herself turned in a different direction. Immediately after, a piercing pain came. Her body was sent tumbling forward, and she stumbled a few steps before regaining her footing.\n\nNian Bing was facing Long Ling. A bloodied hole appeared on his right shoulder blade; his body had been completely pierced by that arrow. Fortunately, after several successive blocks, the Dragon Guiding Arrow's explosive power had been robbed<sup>1</sup>, coupled with the Verdant Curtain Serene changing its direction slightly, this allowed Nian Bing to avoid a fatal threat. Nevertheless, the residual power of the Dragon Guiding Arrow still pierced his body. Blood gushed out. Nian Bing, without any hesitation, slapped a healing spell onto himself. Only then did the bleeding somewhat cease.\n\n\"No, this is impossible.\" Long Ling's voice trembled. The pain in her back had somewhat subsided. Only then did she realize what had happened earlier. She had blocked in front of Nian Bing, but Nian Bing had suddenly embraced her from behind and spun around. The Dragon Guiding Arrow had pierced Nian Bing's shoulder blade and only disappeared upon hitting her. Yet at this moment, she had no injuries whatsoever apart from a slight pain.\n\nNian Bing gave a bitter laugh: \"This was an inevitable outcome, Ling'er. Come, your healing is better than mine, help me stop the bleeding. This time, I'm afraid we can't escape this calamity.\"\n\nLong Ling hurried back to Nian Bing's side. She first slapped a healing spell onto the cup-sized wound on Nian Bing's shoulder, then violently tore open the coarse cloth shirt around his wound. \"The vest, where's the vest? Why didn't you wear the vest I gave you yesterday?\" Long Ling's voice became exceptionally agitated. \"Could it be that even things I give you are so annoying to you?\"\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> This phrase (搶劫了戰鬥的能力) is a direct translation used to indicate being incapacitated or rendered unable to fight.\n<sup>2</sup> The character 六 (liù, meaning 'six') here is likely a typo for 立 (lì, meaning 'to stand' or 'to remain'), given the context of the sentence.

    "content": "「不，傻龍靈，你知道麼？昨天你給我那件背心之後，我的心都快碎了。那明明是老師給你的啊！連你的體香還清晰可聞，我怎麼能用你的護身寶物來保護自己呢？傻丫頭，現在就穿在你身上啊！否則，剛才我們恐怕就要成一對穿堂葫蘆了。」¹原來，昨天晚上念冰吹動風笛將鳳女找來，求她在龍靈無法感受到的情況下將背心重新穿回她的身上。以鳳女的能力，做到這一點完全可以神不知鬼不覺，輕易的就完成了。其實，剛才念冰完全可以由龍靈為自己擋住龍引箭，以那金紅背心的強度，龍靈也只會受點震傷而已，但是，作為一個男人，又怎麼能讓女人為自己擋這一箭呢？念冰那時根本沒有任何的猶豫，迅速抱著龍靈轉身，他 resistant 的冰牆術捲軸成為了最後一道防禦，但是，卻依然受了重創。\n\n龍靈看著念冰眼中那溫柔的光芒，再看看他那蒼白的臉色，她的心顫抖了，原本空洞的眼神中多了幾分神采，扶著念冰坐了下來，而自己卻挺直嬌軀，朝外面走去。此時，金猊已經帶領著手下們緩緩前逼，傷了對方最主要的魔法師，他們已經沒有顧忌了，其實，雙方交手到現在，一共也只是半柱香的時間而已²，卻生了如此多的變化，從開始的鳳女衝擊，護眾人入洞，再到奮力抵擋、紫清劍狂化、鳳女出擊、念冰重傷，幾乎每一瞬間，場上都生著變化。\n\n沒有了鳳女的抵擋，誰還能攔的住金猊呢？傭兵們聚集在一起，他們心中的鬥志在對方帶來的龐大壓迫下逐漸瓦解，任何人都知道。這一次，他們再沒可能抵擋地住對方的攻擊。就在這時，龍靈來到了眾傭兵之後，低低的吟唱著，「以我的生命為代價。詛咒一切的……」剛吟唱到這裡，一隻大手突然從後面捂住了她地嘴，強行將咒語打斷。一個魔法咒語，如果吟唱過一半，就是不可能打斷的，否則對魔法師將產生極大的傷害，而剛開始的魔法吟唱，只要將吟唱打斷，魔法就無法完成。\n\n「龍靈，這個魔法咒語就算要用也應該是我用，而不是你。」念冰將龍靈緊緊摟在懷中，他的聲音是那麼的堅定。\n\n念冰溫暖的懷抱讓龍靈感到很安心，即使知道即將面臨著毀滅性的災難，她也沒有絲毫恐懼。摟著龍靈濕軟的嬌軀，念冰暗暗苦笑，該來地總是要來，剛想吟唱與龍靈同樣的咒語之時，一個聲音突然打消了他的念頭。\n\n「快，大家快向裡面撤，裡面洞身狹窄更好防禦。」這是風雲的聲音，念冰回身看去，只見風雲正從洞內跑了出來。與此同時，誰都沒有想到的是，鳳女爆發了。\n\n如果說鳳女是一顆巨大的炸彈，那金猊重創念冰就是引爆這顆炸彈的導火索。悽厲的鳳鳴聲猶如刺耳的尖針一般扎入每個人地耳中，鳳女身體周圍的紅色戰氣驟然收斂。粉紅色的長髮在這一刻變成了暗紅色，原本白皙的肌膚閃爍著淡淡的紅色光彩，背後的衣服突然破開，一對紅色羽翼瞬間舒展，羽翼內側邊緣呈弧形，一根根鳳翎緊密的排列在一起，舒展的羽翼長達兩米以上，鳳女原本修長地嬌軀在這對羽翼的映襯下顯得如此嬌小。羽翼大張之下，鳳女的身體完全漂浮起來，她那雙碧藍色的美眸在這一刻變成了金色。\n\n金猊看到這種情形不禁大驚失色，「小心，是鳳族的王族之羽。」\n\n他的提醒已經來不及了。同樣是紅色的戰氣，隨著羽翼的飄然下擊化為一圈光暈，無可抵禦地巨力傳遍圍攻鳳女的每一名火龍人戰士身體，十八道鮮血同時狂噴而出，伴隨著十八道身影被震飛出十丈之外。\n\n半空中的鳳女長嘯一聲，手中天堂劍虛空橫斬，一道湛然紅芒飄然而下，在那巨大的洞口前劃出一道溝壑，澎湃的戰氣將原本前沖地火龍人戰士全部逼退。\n\n看到如此情形，念冰心中不喜反憂，在危機中展現出巨大的力量，很有可能是不屬於自己的力量，越是這樣，反噬就會越嚴重，他趕忙大喊道：「鳳女，快帶著紫清劍大哥回來，洞裡面窄小，適合我們防禦。」\n\n半空中閃光耀著淡淡的殘影，鳳女一閃身已經來到紫清劍上空，探手抓住他身上的衣襟，提著他高飛而起。此時，紫清劍的神志完全處於瘋狂之中，根本分辨不出敵友，手中重劍驟然向上撩起，朝鳳女劈去。\n\n「笨蛋，是我。」鳳女一橫天堂神劍，輕鬆的擋掉紫清劍的攻擊。說也奇怪，狂化中的紫清劍一聽到鳳女的聲音，頓時變得老實起來。「嗡――」銀色的聖戰氣龍引箭再次出現，這一次，目標正是空中的鳳女。金猊很清楚，得罪了鳳族的王族，代表著與鳳族之間將出現無法彌補的溝壑，只有將鳳女和所有人都擊殺在這裡，才有可能掩蓋一切。\n\n巨大的紅色羽翼驟然收斂，左翼閃電般橫揮，先前那念冰竭盡全力都無法抵擋的龍引箭竟然直接被鳳女那巨大的羽翼拍碎，下一刻，鳳女已經來到洞口，手中天堂神劍一橫，將所有攻上來的敵人都震的退了回去。\n\n念冰下意識的去拉鳳女，「快去，向裡面撤。」此時，傭兵們見鳳女抵擋住敵人，已經快速的朝洞穴深處撤去。他突然驚呼一聲，抓住鳳女的手 involuntarily 鬆開了，現在的鳳女，身上就像火炭一般灼熱。\n\n鳳女眼中寒光湛放，凝神著手持長弓的金猊，冷聲道：「今日我還沒有殺人，不過，這並不代表接下來也不會，有本事你們就衝進來好了。」說完，掩護著念冰等人向洞內撤去。\n\n出乎意料的是。火龍人不知道是否是因為鳳女突然展現出的強悍能力，竟然真的沒有攻進來。任由鳳女、念冰和傭兵們撤入洞內。\n\n傭兵們退入洞內數百米後，進入一條寬約三米的狹窄甬道後再也堅持不住，一個個如同癱瘓一般坐倒在地。此時，就連冰月傭兵團地三位正副團長，實力也僅剩餘不足三分之一了。雖然沒有一人死亡，但是，重傷者卻占據了三分之二，這之前幸虧龍靈給他們及時治療，這才能夠堅持逃到這裡。\n\n鳳女手起掌落，將紫清劍打的昏了過去扔在一旁，回身向外面看了一眼。這才鬆了口氣。\n\n「你幹什麼打我哥哥？」紫清夢憤怒的道。\n\n鳳女那金色的雙眸中散出冰冷的氣息，令紫清夢不禁全身一顫，「他在狂化狀態，只有打昏過去才能恢復過來，不過，他雖然體力沒有耗盡，恐怕也要昏睡兩天才能恢復。」念冰關切地看著鳳女，道：「你怎麼樣？」\n\n鳳女搖了搖頭，道：「我沒事。你呢？」金色的目光落在念冰右肩那個恐怖的傷口處。\n\n念冰此時的臉色已經非常難看了，大量失血使他原本紅潤的面龐變得異常蒼白，苦笑道：「還死不了。不過，我右肩的肩胛骨似乎斷了，我用魔法止血，想治好恐怕沒什麼機會。鳳女，你說他們為什麼不衝進來？是因為怕你麼？」\n\n鳳女搖頭道：「不，應該不是。我也是剛發現的。這些火龍人似乎對這個洞穴有所畏懼一般，從最開始我向洞口攻擊時，他們就故意躲避著，避免進入洞內。現在想起來，如果我們早些選擇撤入洞中，或許形勢就會好的多了。不過，至少目前我們還不會有事。」\n\n「對不起，都是我的錯。」卡洛沉重地聲音響起。「都是我的意願才將大家帶入了這片死地。如果我早聽念冰的建議放棄這次行動，也不會連累你們一起陷在這裡了。」\n\n鳳女目光落在卡洛身上，淡淡道：「你用不著自責，陷在這裡的只是你們，以我的能力，隨時可以帶念冰離開。不過，我最多也只能帶一個人。」此言一出，整個洞穴內部都變得寂靜起來，沒有人會懷疑鳳女的話，她已經用自己的實力證明了一切。\n\n「鳳女，你帶龍靈走吧。」念冰的聲音很平靜，但卻異常堅定。\n\n鳳女、紫清夢和龍靈的目光同時落在他身上，鳳女怪異地道：「你不想活著離開這裡麼？」\n\n念冰看了一眼自己軟垂於身旁的右臂，淡然道：「沒有人願意去死，但是，作為一名魔法師，作為一名廚師，我已經失去了右臂，即使出去治好了傷，我也不可能再用右手做菜，用右手畫捲軸了，我這一生，有兩個目標，一個是達到廚藝的顛峰，完成師傅的心愿，而另一個，則是修煉魔法到至高境界為父母報仇。失去了右臂，這些對我來說都是渺茫的，與其如此，為什麼不將生的希望讓給別人？其實是……」說到這裡，他突然壓低聲音，湊到鳳女耳邊低低地說了幾個字。\n\n鳳女全身一震，「什麼？你的仇人竟然是她？」\n\n念冰點了點頭，苦澀的一笑，道：「你先休息一會兒恢復體力，然後帶龍靈走吧。如果將來你自信能力過那個人，順便替我報仇，也不枉我們朋友一場，當然，這只是我的一個請求，請你在自己完全有能力達成的情況下再去。」\n\n「不，我不會離開這裡的。」龍靈一邊為傷員治療著傷勢，一邊平靜的說道。\n\n「龍靈，你別任性。」這句話同時從念冰和 Li Da³口中說出，兩人的神情都變得急切起來。龍靈抬起頭，微微一笑，以往地神采重新出現在她那美麗的俏臉上，「我沒有任性啊！既然一起來，那就要一起走，否則，我是絕不會離開的，這裡的傷員們需要我。念冰，謝謝你，至少我現在明白，我曾經愛過的人並沒有愛錯。」\n\n念冰眉頭大皺，強忍著肩膀不斷傳來的劇痛，「龍靈，你別忘了，龍智老師只有你一個女兒，如果你出了事，老師怎麼辦？工會怎麼辦？」\n\n龍靈淡然道：「如果父親在這裡，他也絕不會捨棄戰友而獨自逃生的。」\n\n鳳女冷冷地道：「你是在說我麼？」\n\n龍靈搖了搖頭，道：「當然不，我根本沒有資格說你，這裡任何一個人也沒有資格。如果不是你，我們早已經被那些火龍人殺了，是你救了所有人的命。我看得出，你也不是普通的人類，我想，你進入人類世界一定有著自己的使命，所以，你要走我們誰都沒有意見。可以的話，帶念冰走吧，他的傷雖然很重，但只要找到光明系能使用九階以上治療魔法的魔導士，還是有可能讓他完全痊癒的。」\n\n念冰笑了，「龍靈，我們不要爭了，既然都不願意走，就都留下來好了。反正敵人不會衝進來，那我們就一起在這裡餓死好了。我想，我們帶來的材料應該還夠吃一個月的。如果省一些，說不定能堅持更長時間。」\n\n紅色光芒收斂，鳳女變回了本來形態，念冰發現她的身體在微微的顫抖著，他小心地扶著她關切的問道：「鳳女，你沒事吧？」\n\n鳳女搖了搖頭，道：「哼。念冰，我想和你單獨談談，可以麼？」\n\n念冰楞了一下，道：「當然可以。」當下，他扶著鳳女走到一旁的角落處，讓她坐了下來，同時再奮起不多的魔法力又給自己肩膀上的傷口施放了一個治療術。\n<br>\n---\n¹ *Chuāntáng húlu* (穿堂葫蘆): Literally \"gourds pierced through the hall,\" an idiom describing something, often people, being pierced through by arrows or similar objects, implying vulnerability and easy penetration.\n² *Half an incense stick's time*: A traditional Chinese measurement of time, roughly equivalent to 15-30 minutes.\n³ Li Da (里鎝): An unknown character, possibly a typo for another character or a minor character not previously introduced.",

    "content": "「你也看到了，我確實不是真正的人類。」鳳女自嘲的笑笑，全身顫抖得更加厲害，先前還灼熱的身體此時卻變得有些冰冷了。\n\n念冰將鳳女摟入自己懷中，鳳女也並沒有掙扎，*在念冰的左肩上，感受著他身上的熱量。「念冰，你是怎麼知道龍人族存在的？」\n\n念冰此時對自己的安危沒有任何擔憂，早在他的右肩那龍引箭穿透之時，他就已經放下了一切包袱，就像他自己說的那樣，即使活著離開這裡也會是一個廢人，別說給父母報仇了，能否照顧自己都是個未知數。摟著鳳女，此時的他們宛如一對情侶般，苦中做樂的感覺別有一番風味，念冰微微一笑，先從粗布衣上撕下一條布纏繞在傷口上，這才道：「我是從貓貓父親那裡知道的這些......」當下，他將當初在冰雪城與鳳女分手後，如何又遇到貓貓，以及貓貓的父親龍召喚師希拉德的情形說了一遍。\n\n「原來如此，怪不得你會知道龍人族的存在。念冰，到了這時候，我也沒有向你隱瞞的必要了。你應該已經聽到那金猊族長說的話了，不錯，我是鳳族人。鳳凰與巨人一樣，都曾經是這片大陸上的生物，只不過，與龍族不同的是，鳳凰只有一隻，準確的說，火鳳凰的數量永遠只能是一。但是，鳳凰與龍族不同的地方是，鳳凰永遠不死，時間是無法限制它存在的。但是，當年鳳凰大人卻在遠古戰爭中為了保護人類而受到了無法彌補的創傷，它的靈魂直接受到了敵人的攻擊，即使是涅磐重生的能力也不能使牠繼續活下去¹，所以，在萬般無奈之下，鳳凰大人將自己的血脈留給了人類。也就是說，我們鳳族人其實就是擁有鳳凰血脈的人類。龍人族與我們的情況不同。他們得到的只是龍族極小一部分血脈，就像鐵北地龍那樣。我們同時屬於變異人的一種，龍人族憑藉與龍族血脈的能力，族人們大多在短期內和防禦兩方面有著特別突出的能力。但是，他們除了身體表面那層類似於龍的鱗甲以外，並沒有其他龍族的力量。龍，是大陸上最強大的生物。而且一直都存在著。又怎麼可能將自己的能力真正傳給人類呢？而我們鳳族卻不一樣，我們所得到的，是真正的鳳凰之力，絕大部分族人與龍人一樣，都繼承了鳳凰的部分能力。但是，還有極小一部分族人卻真正繼承了鳳凰的血脈，經過不斷地進化，甚至可以成為真正的鳳凰，這些人，也就是鳳族中的王族。」\n\n念冰深吸口氣。比起希拉德那種表面的解釋，鳳女的訴說要簡練，明晰的多，「那這麼說，你就是鳳族中的王族了？剛才你背後出現的翅膀就是你所說的進化嗎？」\n\n鳳女點了點頭，輕嘆一聲。道：「真沒想到，我第一次使用鳳凰的力量竟然是與龍人族作對。其實，我們鳳族與龍族之間本身的關係是很好的。遠祖鳳凰曾經是龍神大人的弟子，雖然鳳凰的力量永遠比不上真正的神龍，但是，鳳凰卻有著自己特殊的能力。我雖然是王族中的一員，又是先天九離之體。但修煉的年頭畢竟還太短了。貿然使用了鳳凰的力量對我自身傷害極大。本來我還以為能帶你出去，但是，剛才一收回鳳凰之翼我才發現²，我現在根本沒有能力離開這裡了。想真正進化成鳳凰是何等的困難，從遠祖鳳凰將自己的血脈流傳下來之後，還沒有一位王族成員能夠完成這項壯舉，使鳳凰重新出現在大陸之上。」\n\n念冰想了想，道：「鳳女，正陽刀上的火焰神之石是最純淨的火系寶石，或許它能幫助你儘快恢復體力吧。你們鳳凰的變身需要什麼特定條件嗎？剛才你那算到了什麼程度的變身？」一邊說著，他將正陽刀取出來交給了鳳女。\n\n鳳女看著紅光閃爍的火焰神之石，微微一笑，道：「謝謝你，念冰。鳳凰的力量太神秘了，當初，遠祖鳳凰也只是將自己的血脈流傳下來，就真正的死去。別說是我，就是族中的長老也不知道鳳凰不瞅不睬的進化需要什麼條件³，他們只是告訴我，想進化成為真正的鳳凰需要通過九次進化。每一次進化，都能多擁有鳳凰的一種能力，當完成最後一次進化之時，就能脫離人體，成為真正的火鳳凰。而我現在只是完成了第一次進化而已，剛才你看到的鳳凰之翼，是第二次進化。我的祖先中最偉大的天才也只完成過五次進化而已，我從來沒想過能達到最高的九次進化，只是想多增強一些實力，來保護我的族人們。畢竟，龍人族至少有七個分支，而我們鳳族卻只有一個。普通的人類只要喝下我們鳳族的血液⁴，就同樣能擁有鳳族的能力，同時，我們鳳族留存著許多珍貴的秘密，那些卑鄙的人類中，早有人覬覦。我是鳳族王族戰士，所以，我必須要變得更強大才能保護我的族人們。」\n\n念冰點了點頭，道：「原來如此，鳳女，你能擁有接近武聖的實力，就是由於鳳凰之體的第一次進化了？如果你能真正完成第二次進化，是不是就能真正擁有先前的力量？」\n\n鳳女苦笑道：「別做夢了，鳳凰之體的進化只會讓我能力增加，而不會增強我的實力。想變得強大，就需要不斷地修煉，超越自己。即使真正完成了第二次進化，想完全控制好鳳凰之翼，也需要長時間的修煉和實戰才行。世間本沒有不勞而獲的事，即使是我們鳳族也不行。剛才我之所以能爆出那麼強的力量，是因為我燃燒了自己的鳳凰之血，在鳳凰血脈燃燒起的鳳凰之火作用下才能使用那不屬於我的力量。所以，表面看來我沒什麼，但是，我現在失血卻並不比你少。火焰神之石雖然能幫我更好地恢復能力，但卻無法幫我血液再生，鳳族燃燒血液是在最迫不得已的情況下才會進行的一種自救方法，很傷元氣，沒有三個月的時間我都無法完全恢復。」\n\n念冰微微一笑，道：「看來。我們也只能在這裡做同命鴛鴦了⁵。鳳女，你把我叫過來，就是為了要在我們死前將你的身世告訴我嗎？」\n\n鳳女白了念冰一眼，道：「當然不是了，我叫你過來，是想和你商量一下如何才能更好的生存下去。雖然我們已經陷入了死地，卻並不是沒有辦法脫困的。」\n\n念冰心中一動，看了看周圍，雖然已經進入洞穴數百米。但洞穴裡周圍的洞壁卻極為特殊。能夠散出淡紅色的光點，洞穴內的火元素極為活躍，也正是憑藉這很弱的紅光，才能勉強分辨出周圍的事物。「鳳女，你的意思是要憑藉我們的力量從這洞穴中挖一條路出去嗎？」\n\n鳳女沒好氣的道：「別做夢了，難道你沒發現這裡的岩石格外堅硬嗎？而且我們現在在山腹之中，就算擁有離天、正陽這樣的寶刀，想挖條通道出去也是絕不可能的。我想，這裡之所以有如此溫暖的環境，就和這座山的結構分不開。單是食物就使我們無法堅持下去。你那麼聰明，就不會往別的地方想想？」\n\n念冰眼光光芒一閃，腦海中靈光大放，「既然出不去，我們就往裡走。說不定裡面還有通往外面的路呢。既然已經進來了，總要去我們那寶藏去看一看。」\n\n鳳女微微一笑，道：「我也是這麼想的。如果我猜的不錯，在這個洞穴中應該生活著一條火系亞龍，也就是金猊所稱的龍主。亞龍比起地龍來要高級的多，但也不是真正的巨龍。既然有亞龍在這裡，那我們就必須有出路。亞龍也可以稱為飛龍，它們是可以飛行的，不過這種亞龍大多很懶惰，每一次睡覺都會持續數月之久⁶，它們是巨龍的近親，所以，龍人族們大多都會尋找到一條亞龍，以它為本族的龍主。亞龍的能力極強，而且很聰明，它們雖然不是真正的龍，但本身已經有了一些巨龍的能力，實力上至少不會比你剛才說的那頭金背地龍王差，甚至有可能更強。但亞龍身體巨大，肯定不能從這麼窄的洞穴通過。這裡雖然已經是洞穴深處，但你沒發現空氣卻很清新嗎？如果我猜的沒錯，那隻亞龍應該在洞穴最深處睡覺，而從那裡，應該有一條更為寬闊的通路能夠離開這個洞穴。那也就是我們要找的地方。」\n\n念冰眼中光芒大放，如果能不死，誰願意留在這個鬼地方呢？再加上龍靈曾經說過，九階的光明魔法是能夠治療好他現在傷勢的。只要活著就有希望啊！儘管心中因為曙光的出現而大為興奮，他還是不失冷靜，點了點頭，道：「那好，我們先休息一下，等體力恢復一些，就到這座洞穴深處探一探。只要找到通路，我就能憑藉魔法飛出去，再接你們離開山洞。」\n\n鳳女點了點頭，道：「在發現那些火龍人沒有追過來的時候我就有了這個想法，不過，現在有幾個問題必須要注意，而這幾個問題最主要就體現在，我們絕不能驚醒那頭亞龍。否則，就算是我保持全盛時期的能力，也絕不是亞龍的對手，我們會死的很難看。」\n\n念冰點了點頭，道：「你對龍族熟悉，有什麼問題你就直說吧，我一定配合，我想，卡洛會長他們也會配合你的。」\n\n鳳女道：「還記得卡洛在來之前對你的許諾嗎？他沒有說錯，寶藏真的存在，亞龍的智慧已經接近巨龍，所以，它與巨龍有著同樣的愛好。那就是收集各種珍寶。這裡既然是亞龍的巢穴，那麼寶藏很有可能比我們想像中還要大的多。亞龍在睡覺時雖然睡的很沉，但是，一旦有人敢於動它的寶物，哪怕只是一個金幣，它也會立刻清醒過來。」\n\n念冰目瞪口呆的道：「不會吧？龍族竟然這麼貪財嗎？」\n\n鳳女展顏一笑，道：「龍族那個『守財媽』⁷的外號可是由來已久的，這並不需要奇怪。所以，我們如果想活著離開這裡，就不能有任何人動那些財寶的念頭，否則，大家都會死。亞龍對於膽敢侵犯自己家當的敵人可不會留情的。那些傭兵你、我了解都不深，在面對共同敵人的時候可以同仇敵愾，但是，一旦面對財寶的誘惑，他們能否禁受住考驗就會影響到我們。你明白我的意思了？」\n\n念冰點了點頭，道：「你的擔心完全有道理，別說是他們，如果我看到了自己極為需要的魔法書籍，恐怕也會忍耐不住動手的。」\n\n鳳女撲哧一笑，道：「你都成這模樣了，還貪心嗎？」\n\n念冰摟緊鳳女，閉上眼睛道：「真想永遠這樣下去。鳳女，我想我自由的時間不會太久了。如果能活著出去，或許在感情方面我會做出選擇。」\n\n鳳女沉默了一會兒，半晌後才道：「我知道，其實，昨天晚上你的表情已經告訴了我很多事。她確實是個好女孩兒，人家能夠那樣為了你付出，確實值得你愛了。我恭喜你們。」\n\n念冰沒有再多說什麼，當他真正知道了鳳女的身份後，更明白自己與鳳女本就是兩個世界的人，他也不願再對龍靈有任何傷害。所以，他現在只能珍惜這最後與鳳女在一起的時光。\n\n洞外。金猊任由自己的族人們幫自己在傷口上敷上草藥。\n\n「族長，我們就在這裡乾等著嗎？」一名火龍人族戰士試探著問道。\n\n金猊的神情顯得有些委頓，傭兵團的強悍大出他意料之外，尤其是鳳女的實力和狂化的紫清劍，如果不是他們，那些傭兵早已經葬身在這裡。\n---\n¹ **活下雲 (huó xià yún)**: The character 雲 (yún - cloud) is a likely typo for 去 (qù - go/away).

    "content": "Jin Ni glanced at the clan member and said coldly, \"Have you forgotten the Dragon Lord's command? No one is allowed to enter the Fire Dragon Cave without its order.\"\n\n\"But what if those humans wake up the Dragon Lord? The Dragon Lord might get angry then.\"\n\nA cold glint shone in Jin Ni's eyes. \"If they were smart, they wouldn't do that. What's more, there's a Phoenix clan member among them, and that person won't let them do it either. Take a hundred men to the mountaintop. If they try to escape from there, you know what to do. Although the Fire Dragon Cave has two exits, they have no chance whatsoever. I'll trap them inside until they die. Let's see how long they can last. If they truly disturb the Dragon Lord, then I can only mourn for them. I don't think the Dragon Lord's anger will be too severe, even if it happens. I've already prepared plenty of his favorite dried snow fish.\"\n\n\"Elder, this is bad! All our seriously wounded brothers are dead!\" A Fire Dragon Man warrior rushed over.\n\n\"What? How is that possible? Although their injuries were severe, given their self-healing ability, they shouldn't have died.\" Jin Ni stood up abruptly, his chest wound pulling, and his face became even uglier.\n\n\"Elder, it's poison. And it seems to be a highly potent poison specifically targeting our Dragon Man race. The brothers all died, their bodies blackened. I think it must be that Phoenix clan woman; her sword has poison on it.\"\n\nJin Ni's whole body trembled. Although they were enemies, his impression of Feng Nü was surprisingly good. It wasn't because Feng Nü was beautiful, but because she had held back during their combat, even when she was in an extremely furious state at the end. She hadn't gone for the kill.\n\n\"No, it absolutely couldn't be her. Otherwise, in her Phoenix Transformation state, she wouldn't need to poison our people; she could kill them easily. Come, take me to see.\" With that, Jin Ni, led by his clansmen, walked into the forest. He didn't notice that at the exact moment he entered the forest, an almost imperceptible black figure quietly slipped into the cave.\n\nAs time passed, the members of the Ice Moon Mercenary Group gradually calmed down. Li Te, Feng Yun, and Long Ling took out some instant food and water from their spatial magic items for everyone to eat and drink. After a careful count, out of all thirty-nine people, everyone except Long Ling, Li Te, and Feng Yun had sustained injuries of varying degrees, with serious injuries totaling twenty-three. Most only barely had mobility, but thankfully, there were no fatalities yet.\n\nNian Bing and Feng Nü had returned to the group. With Long Ling's help, his injured shoulder was re-treated. Li Te used the magic power he had accumulated for half a day to cast a seventh-tier water-element healing spell on him, which somewhat reduced Nian Bing's pain. However, water-element healing could at most heal his wounds; it couldn't mend broken bones and meridians. In this situation, within this cave, there was no better solution.\n\nNian Bing briefly told Li Te, Karlo, Gatlin, and Hua Rui about Feng Nü's conjectures regarding the cave. Upon hearing the possibility of escape, everyone immediately became greatly excited.\n\nKarlo hesitated for a moment and said, \"Nian Bing. What if we only take that bottle? After all, it belongs to the employer. We've already come all this way...\"\n\nNian Bing interrupted Karlo, stating resolutely, \"At a time like this, you're still concerned about that. Being able to return alive is already the greatest fortune for us. Only by abandoning greed is there a chance of survival. Can wealth truly be compared to life?\"\n\nKarlo sighed and nodded, saying, \"Alright, it's settled then. I'll restrain my subordinates.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned slightly. He didn't sense a resolute emotion in Karlo's tone. Did he still have any illusions at this point? At this moment, he felt for the first time that there was a reason why mercenaries were classified as a lower-tier guild.\n\n\"If anyone attempts to touch those items, I believe I won't be polite. For survival, I don't mind killing,\" Feng Nü said, slowly walking over, leaning on her Sword of Departure from Heaven. Her trembling had ceased. Nian Bing's Positive Sun Blade was currently in her embrace, and relying on the Roar of the God of Flame, her vitality had recovered somewhat after a period of rest.\n\nSeeing Feng Nü's appearance, Karlo's expression immediately turned a bit awkward. \"Miss Feng Nü, please don't misunderstand. I will definitely restrain my subordinates; you can rest assured about that. We don't want to be buried here either!\"\n\nFeng Nü nodded. \"That would be for the best, for everyone's lives.\"\n\nAfter deliberation, everyone decided to rest for a few days, at least to allow their injuries to recover a bit. Anyway, there was enough food and water, and a better condition would mean a greater chance of escape.\n\nAs Nian Bing's right arm was severely injured, Zi Qingmeng, also a chef, became the mercenary group's cook. However, she couldn't start a fire and could only be assisted by Nian Bing. It was already dark outside, and for the wounded, dinner was their greatest enjoyment.\n\nNian Bing led Zi Qingmeng to a deeper part of the cave, a space resembling a stone chamber. Nian Bing gave a wry smile and said, \"There's nothing to burn here, so we can only use magic. Miss Zi, I'm troubling you.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng sighed and said, \"What trouble? It's come to this. Let's just focus on getting out alive first.\" As she spoke, she stuck several borrowed warrior's swords into the ground. Nian Bing took out an iron pot from his spatial ring, and as he produced various seasonings and food ingredients, the place already looked like a makeshift kitchen.\n\n\"Miss Zi, frankly speaking, do you regret participating in this mercenary group operation with me?\"\n\nZi Qingmeng glanced at Nian Bing and said, \"If I said no, I'd definitely be lying to you. But what's the use of regretting now? Let's talk about it after we can leave here. Don't call me Miss Zi anymore, just call me Qingmeng. Didn't you say we were friends after all?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, somewhat flattered. \"That's rare! You're rarely so polite normally.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng snorted. \"I just dislike your arrogance and your fickleness.\"\n\n\"Arrogance? Do I have it? Fickleness? That's not a word to describe me, is it?\" Nian Bing tried hard to forget the injury to his right arm, his tone sounding very relaxed, as if he wasn't in danger.\n\nZi Qingmeng said, \"How can you not? Before you came to the academy, I was always the youngest and most talented chef. But as soon as you arrived, everything was disrupted. Your culinary skills even surpassed Uncle's. Although you always wear a smile on your face, the arrogance in your bones cannot be hidden. As for fickleness, look, you have two girls by your side right now. Isn't that fickleness?\"\n\nNian Bing helplessly shook his head and walked over to the iron pot, sitting down. \"Think whatever you want. You can be the head chef today. I believe your cooking will taste excellent. Everyone's injured, so let's just make some easy-to-digest noodles. I have a bag of flour here, actually. I specifically prepared it for myself for the journey.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng watched Nian Bing take a bag of flour from his spatial ring and couldn't help but smile. \"Although you mages have many drawbacks, sometimes you do have advantages that warriors can't compare to. Let's cooperate. It's a pity your hand is injured; otherwise, with your Dislocation and Bone Setting Ruyi Hand, you could definitely make delicious noodles.\"\n\nNian Bing's expression darkened, and he said indifferently, \"Even if the injury is completely healed, I don't know if I can use the Ruyi Hand again. My right arm has no sensation at all now. Do you think I'll be able to knead dough in the future?\"\n\nZi Qingmeng looked crestfallen. \"I'm sorry, I...\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and smiled. \"A true man can pick something up and put it down. It's already like this, what's the point of saying more? Don't worry, I'm fine. Let's start, don't keep everyone waiting too long.\"\n\nAlthough everything in the cave was so rudimentary, the items Nian Bing had prepared were very complete. They were certainly enough for use. Nian Bing leaned against the wall beside a stone pot. It wasn't his turn to act yet. Watching others cook was a kind of enjoyment for him now. He released a low-tier Fireball spell to light up the cave. Zi Qingmeng skillfully kneaded the dough. Her movements were no different from when Zi Xiu competed with him back then, though her proficiency and control over force were much weaker.\n\n\"Qingmeng, have you also learned Heavy Eagle Hand?\" Nian Bing asked with some curiosity.\n\nZi Qingmeng nodded and said, \"It's one of the unique skills of the culinary world, so of course I've learned it. It's a pity Uncle said I'm a woman, and that women inherently have trouble controlling Heavy Eagle Hand, making it very difficult to master. So, although I've practiced for a long time, I haven't been able to grasp its essence.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"It's a wonderful thing for a girl to learn cooking. You'll definitely marry a good husband in the future.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng's pretty face flushed, and she chided, \"You're so injured, yet your mouth is still unruly! You should rest for a while. I'll call you when I need to boil water.\"\n\nNian Bing acknowledged with a grunt, closed his eyes, and while maintaining the Fireball spell in his hand, entered a state of meditation. His body was indeed too weak.\n\nSoon, the dough was kneaded. Zi Qingmeng's method for making noodles was very simple: she kneaded the dough into a firm ball, which would just need to be knife-cut later. Earlier, when Nian Bing had set up the pot, he had already condensed a large block of ice inside. To save magic power, he didn't use fire-element magic to melt the ice, but rather left it there to melt on its own.\n\nZi Qingmeng placed the dough on the cutting board and turned her gaze towards Nian Bing. Just as she was about to call him to start the fire, she noticed his breathing was steady, as if he had fallen asleep. At this moment, Nian Bing still looked so handsome; his weakness hadn't affected his demeanor, but rather added a touch of melancholy. Zi Qingmeng's heart fluttered. She sighed lightly, yet couldn't bear to wake him up. Looking around, a sudden idea struck her. She used the weapons they had brought earlier to prop up a stand above Nian Bing's hand, which was resting on a stone, so that the low-tier Fireball spell could reach it. She then placed a small pot on top, and a temporary stove was complete.\n\nZi Qingmeng chuckled, thinking to herself, *This improvised stove is really interesting.* She didn't hesitate further. She added oil to the pot and began the process of cooking the noodle sauce. As ingredients were added and skillfully prepared, an aroma wafted out, filling the entire cave. She hadn't cooked in a long time, and Zi Qingmeng couldn't help but feel a bit proud. *It seems my skill hasn't declined after all!*\n\nTaking some melted ice water from the pot, she went aside to carefully wash her own knife. Earlier in the battle, her knife had been stained with blood. Thinking about it now, she couldn't help but smile wryly. Using a kitchen knife as a weapon was indeed unsuitable. Fortunately, this was a time of crisis; otherwise, if customers knew she used a tool for cutting people to cut noodles, who knew what they would think.\n\n\"So fragrant, so fragrant, so very fragrant.\" A voice suddenly rang out, startling Zi Qingmeng. She instinctively turned around but found no one; everything was still the same.\n\n\"Hmph, you're trying to scare me, aren't you?\" She walked a few steps to Nian Bing's side and lightly kicked his leg. \"Hey, stop pretending. I know you've been awake for a while.\"\n\nNian Bing woke from his meditation. He had indeed been too tired earlier and had actually fallen asleep just as he was about to enter meditation. Fortunately, he still had the feeling of maintaining the Fireball spell in his mind, which kept the flame in his hand from extinguishing. Rubbing his eyes, he said, \"Is the dough kneaded? Then let's start making the sauce.\"\n\n\"Why are you pretending? You suddenly spoke just now and scared me. Don't you know that scaring people can scare them to death?\" Zi Qingmeng looked at him, somewhat displeased.\n\n\"Me? When did I speak just now? You must have heard wrong,\" Nian Bing said, bewildered.\n\nZi Qingmeng frowned slightly. \"It's just you and me here. If it wasn't you who spoke, did I just see a ghost?\"\n\nNian Bing said helplessly, \"Are you sure it was really my voice?\"\n\nZi Qingmeng was stunned for a moment, then thought, \"You made a strange noise to scare me. The voice seemed a little deeper than yours.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head. \"Alright, fine, let's say I scared you. Hurry up and cook. Oh, you've already made the sauce. Let me smell it, so fragrant! It should be an authentic diced eggplant sauce. Not bad, even if it were me, I might not reach your level!\"\n\nPleased by Nian Bing's praise, Zi Qingmeng forgot her earlier displeasure and smiled. \"Alright, fine. Boil the water, let's cook the noodles.\"\n\nWith Nian Bing's help, in a short while, a large pot of knife-cut noodles was ready. One didn't even need to eat; just smelling the rich aroma of the noodles and sauce made one's mouth water. Although Zi Qingmeng was only a Swordmaster-level warrior, carrying two basins, one large and one small, was not difficult for her. The two returned the way they came to deliver the meal to the mercenaries.",

    "content": "However, none of them noticed that just as they left, a sound of swallowing saliva faintly echoed from deep within the cave, interspersed with an angry voice, \"Damn it! Why is this cave so small? So fragrant, so fragrant, so fragrant. Forget it, I'll go back to sleep. What a few little bugs make won't be delicious anyway. Right, it definitely won't be good, sleep, sleep......\"\n\nAfter three full days of rest, everyone's injuries had improved. Nianbing's shoulder injury had healed, but for him, this was not good news. His sinews and bones were broken; surface healing meant nothing. This arm of his was temporarily useless. The better news was Ziqingjian's recovery to consciousness; as he hadn't exhausted his stamina, he was still as lively and energetic as ever after recovering.\n\n\"Guild Master Karlo,\" Nianbing said, \"I think we should scout ahead in the cave first. Those who are injured should stay here, and once we find an exit, we'll come back to pick them up.\"\n\nKarlo nodded and said, \"Nianbing, your injury is severe. You should stay too. Just a few of us and Miss Feng Nü going should be enough.\"\n\nNianbing shook his head and replied, \"I'm fine. I still have quite a few scrolls on me; they might be able to help you. Teacher Lid, how has your magic power recovered?\"\n\nLid replied, \"It has fully recovered. I'll go with you too; it's good for everyone to look out for each other.\"\n\nAfter discussion, the group decided that Feng Nü, Ziqingjian, Karlo, Gatlin, Nianbing, and Lid—six people in total—would enter the cave to find an exit. The others would rest in place and await news.\n\nLeaving their extra belongings behind, Nianbing and the other five proceeded lightly equipped. Feng Nü walked at the very front, followed by Ziqingjian. Nianbing, due to his injury, walked at the rear of the group, using a Fire Spell to light the way for everyone. Before setting out, Nianbing had asked Feng Nü about her injuries. Feng Nü told him that she had recovered about fifty percent, but her vital energy was severely damaged, and it would be impossible to fully recover without several months.\n\nThe cave was indeed very deep, its size fluctuating between large and small. At its narrowest, they needed to bend to pass through. In larger areas, six people could walk abreast. The deeper they went, the higher the temperature rose. Fortunately, the cave was well-ventilated, so while they felt a bit hot, they could still endure it.\n\nThey walked for a full hour. The cave ahead remained deep. Feng Nü turned back to glance at Nianbing at the very rear. Nianbing nodded to her, signaling he was fine. Just then, they suddenly discovered a turn in the deep cavern ahead. And beyond the turn, some light seemed to be flickering.\n\nThe few of them exchanged silent glances, raising their guard simultaneously. Feng Nü drew out her Li Tian Sword, and Ziqingjian took his heavy sword from his back into his hand. Nianbing and Lid each chanted their most proficient spell, ready to react at any moment.\n\nTurning the corner, everything before them underwent a massive change. The six of them gasped in low voices almost simultaneously, all stopping in their tracks.\n\nBefore them lay an indescribably huge cavern. The cavern extended directly from bottom to top, with daylight shining directly into it. From visual estimation alone, this colossal cavern was probably a thousand *zhang*¹ high, an entirely hollowed-out mountain interior. The spacious area could easily accommodate ten thousand people. What surprised them most, however, were the two mountains before them. One was a treasure mountain glittering with colorful light, and the other was a mountain of flesh formed by a gigantic creature.\n\nThe multicolored treasure mountain was piled up to a height of three *zhang*¹, with various treasures shimmering with light under the daylight. The treasures were primarily gemstones, but there were also many strange objects among them, and even some weapons of extremely fine quality. What most attracted Nianbing was a few jade-made boxes in the military alliance treasure mountain; based on his past knowledge from the library, those were clearly used for holding books. If Karlo's information was accurate, those might be the ancient magic books he desired.\n\nKarlo swallowed a mouthful of saliva, murmuring, \"Heavens! This pile of treasure could probably rival any country's national treasury. Luckily, Huarui didn't come, otherwise, she probably wouldn't be able to resist.\"\n\nNianbing walked to Feng Nü's side and whispered, \"This... is this really a sub-dragon? Why does it look like a true dragon?\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled bitterly and said, \"It seems our luck is truly good. You're right, this is indeed a true dragon, a fire dragon.\"\n\nThough Nianbing had faintly guessed it, he still couldn't help but tremble all over, a look of horror appearing in his eyes. The massive body lying beside the treasure mountain was identical to the wind dragon he had seen last time, only its body was larger, and its scales were red. Its total body length was nearly ten *zhang*¹. Its two massive dragon wings spread out, draped on the ground, protecting its huge dragon body. It bore a pair of antlers on its head, a mustache at the corners of its mouth, and a pearl beneath its forehead, its entire body covered in golden-red scales. Although its dragon eyes were closed, an intangible aura told everyone that this was an extremely dangerous creature. What the Fire Dragon Humans called the Dragon Lord was not some sub-dragon, but a true fire-elemental dragon. This fact inevitably made Nianbing feel fear.\n\n\"Feng Nü, what should we do now?\" Nianbing's gaze fell upon the beautiful woman beside him.\n\nFeng Nü let out a light laugh, pointed upwards, and said, \"Since there's an exit, of course we're leaving.\"\n\nNianbing was startled, saying, \"You don't seem worried?\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled, \"What is there to worry about? True dragons are even sleepier than sub-dragons. As long as you don't touch its treasures or covet them, it won't wake up even if you shout loudly beside it. Our luck is really good, you know. Don't worry, for us, true dragons are actually less dangerous than sub-dragons, of course, that's when it's not fully awake. I remind you again, no one is to touch those treasures. Otherwise, the dragon killing us would be as simple as pinching an ant to death.\"\n\nKarlo saw Feng Nü look at him and quickly said, \"To be able to see a true dragon is already a good experience for us. Rest assured, I absolutely have no intention of coveting these treasures. Although I'm not young, living another twenty years isn't a problem, and I still want to go back and enjoy my retirement. What now? Should we think of a way to get out?\"\n\nNianbing said, \"I'll go out first. However, this cave is much higher than we imagined, and it would probably be difficult to get a rope long enough. Feng Nü, my magic should be able to support the two of us getting out. We can figure out a way after we're out.\"\n\nFeng Nü nodded. Just as Nianbing was about to use Blizzard, an anomaly suddenly occurred. A black figure, moving at a speed indiscernible to the naked eye, rushed to the pile of multicolored treasures in the blink of an eye. With a bang, the treasures were blasted, scattering in all directions. The black figure extended its hand into it and pulled out a black bottle. A strange laugh rang out, \"Haha, thank you, you idiots, for clearing the way for me, for being my scapegoats.\"\n\nNianbing and the others only then reacted. They saw a person entirely shrouded in a black cloak. From his appearance, his face was completely invisible; his entire being was enveloped in black mist. A bright light shone in Lid's eyes. \"A Dark Mage.\"\n\nAn angry roar suddenly erupted. The fire dragon, which had been on the ground, let out an incomparably furious roar. \"Who touched my treasures? Die!\" A dark red light shot out like lightning from one of the dragon's raised claws, heading straight for the black-robed person's body. The black-robed person dared not confront it head-on. His figure, enveloped in black mist, drifted to the side like a wisp. With a loud crash, the solid mountain wall, under the dragon's furious attack, actually had a large hole appear with a diameter of three *zhang*¹. The temperature inside the entire cavern rapidly rose; not even a speck of debris scattered, and the blasted area completely turned dark.\n\n\"You all play with the dragon, I'm out of here.\" The cold voice was filled with excitement. As they watched, he crushed a scroll. A white hexagram appeared at his feet. With a flash of light, his entire being completely vanished, not even a trace of presence was left behind.\n\nNianbing and Lid simultaneously drew a sharp breath, for they discovered that the scroll the other party used was actually a tenth-tier space-elemental magic scroll that shouldn't have existed—the Call from Afar. Nianbing had once seen an introduction to the Call from Afar on the top floor of the Ice Moon Empire Mage Guild library; it was hailed as the best escape scroll. However, this scroll was one that even an Archmage couldn't create. Not to mention that there were no space-elemental Archmages on the continent at all. This scroll could enable the user to instantly reach a location with a guiding magic circle a thousand *li*² away; it was a long-distance teleportation magic. If there were a space-elemental Archmage, chanting this spell would require a full meal's time³, and it would only be possible to succeed at the cost of consuming all their magic power. Such a precious scroll could no longer be described by its value.\n\nThe six people stood there dumbfounded. What they had to think about now was not where the black-robed person came from or why he did what he did, but how to face the fire dragon, which had completely risen and was in a state of fury.\n\nThe colossal figure stood there like a mountain. Its huge dragon wings spread out to ten *zhang*¹ wide. Fiery red draconic energy billowed from its mouth, and intense fury emanated from its dark red dragon eyes. They had all witnessed the power of that single strike just now. Even Feng Nü at her peak probably couldn't withstand it. Facing the most powerful creature on the continent, the six of them had ashen faces. Staring at the giant dragon, for a moment, they didn't know what to do.\n\nNianbing was still the fastest to react. He coughed once and tentatively said, \"Respected Mr. Dragon, we... we are certainly not allied with that thief. If you have nothing else, we won't disturb your sleep.\"\n\nThe giant dragon lowered its head slightly. \"Despicable humans, are you speaking to me? But that person just clearly said that you brought him here. Moreover, he also stole the Seal of Morda's Bottle that I was guarding. This is all your responsibility. Make your move. I'll give you a chance: if you can injure one of my scales, I will let you leave here.\"\n\n\"We'll fight it out, whether you pull your head back or stick it out, it's still one cut⁴!\" Ziqingjian roared, holding his heavy sword as he charged furiously towards the giant dragon. Karlo sighed inwardly and, along with Gatlin, followed Ziqingjian, charging forward as well. Lid's already prepared Water Dragon Spell was unleashed at this moment. They could only hold onto a glimmer of hope now.\n\n\"Don't attack!\" Feng Nü's startled cry interrupted Nianbing, who was preparing to cast a spell. Her fiery red figure, like lightning, blocked the path in front of the giant dragon. The Li Tian Divine Sword transformed into a dazzling sword light, forcing Ziqingjian, Karlo, and Gatlin back, then meeting Lid's eighth-tier offensive magic. The Li Tian Divine Sword was wielded without a single gap, as if Feng Nü feared missing even the slightest detail.\n\nThe magic was controlled by Lid. Based on Feng Nü's brave rescue of everyone a few days ago, Lid had great faith in her words. As soon as the Water Dragon Spell touched Feng Nü, he immediately recalled it. Despite this, the weakened Feng Nü still couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of fresh blood, stumbling on the ground and almost falling.\n\nNianbing hurried forward to support Feng Nü. \"Feng Nü, what are you doing?\"\n\nFeng Nü gasped a few times and said, \"I'm saving your lives.\" She turned around, faced the fire dragon, and said calmly, \"I really didn't expect that someone as powerful as you would also resort to tricks to deceive us.\"\n\nThe fire dragon snorted and said, \"You're the descendant of that little broken bird⁵, aren't you? No wonder you know the rules.\"\n\nFeng Nü calmly stared at the fire dragon and said, \"So, it's true. I was just guessing earlier, but now you've confirmed it. Dragon God left you seven elemental dragons to guard the human realm. So that the balance of the human realm wouldn't be affected by you, a rule was set: unless humans actively attack or violate you, you are not allowed to proactively attack humans. I'm not wrong, am I? Even though you clearly knew that the black bottle being stolen wasn't our fault, you just incited my companions to attack, simply to kill us.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Lid and the others realized that their lives were saved by Feng Nü. If Feng Nü hadn't risked injury to block their attacks, they would have been destroyed by the fire dragon's powerful counterattack by now.\n\n\"Don't call me giant dragon, I am the Dragon King, the Great Fire Dragon King Galamandis. You are clever, but do you think this is enough to escape your fate? If Dragon God knew that the Seal of Morda's Bottle was stolen, he would also blame me. Although I cannot proactively attack and kill you, trapping you here and letting you starve to death is very easy to do. Don't think that just because I'm sleeping, I don't know anything; I know all about your confrontations with my servants. Your original purpose for coming here was for my treasures; you only gave up because you wanted to live. Therefore, you are also despicable humans, and sparing your lives was the correct choice.\"\n\nNianbing, supporting Feng Nü, said loudly, \"Galamandis, although I don't know what this Seal of Morda's Bottle you speak of is, I assume it must be very important to you. If we promise to help you retrieve this bottle, will you let us go?\"\n\n---\n¹ **zhang**: A traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.3 meters (or 10 Chinese feet).\n² **li**: A traditional Chinese unit of distance, approximately 500 meters (or 0.5 kilometers).\n³ **meal's time**: An idiom meaning a period of time roughly equivalent to the duration of a meal, often implying about an hour.\n⁴ **Whether you pull your head back or stick it out, it's still one cut**: An idiom meaning that regardless of whether one tries to avoid or confront a dangerous situation, the outcome (usually negative) remains the same, implying one might as well face it directly.\n⁵ **little broken bird**: A derogatory term used by the Dragon King, likely referring to the phoenix race or a specific legendary phoenix, hinting at Feng Nü's ancestry.",

    "content": "\"Find them back? You, with your abilities? That scoundrel just now was clearly a remnant of the Dark Devil. The combined strength of you few is not enough to contend with him, let alone find something back. If you truly encounter him, you'll probably be the first to die. Oh, and you're not allowed to call me by my name directly; you must add the three words 'Great and Mighty' before it.\" Jialamandi Si's voice was full of disdain.\n\nNianbing calmly said, \"Alright, Great and Mighty Jialamandi Si, I just want to tell you that humanity's greatest characteristic is creation. Perhaps we are not that person's opponent right now, but that doesn't mean we won't be able to in the future. As long as you are willing to give us time, we will definitely be able to help you find that thing. I can swear an oath.\" As long as he could leave here alive, what was an oath?\n\nJialamandi Si snorted angrily and said, \"Human, I have lived for tens of thousands of years. Do you think your little tricks can deceive me? Your human oaths aren't worth a few cents even if measured in jin*. Alright then, I don't necessarily have to kill you. If you can provide items of equivalent value in exchange for your lives, I can consider letting you leave, and I won't let my servants stop you.\" As he spoke, his raised dragon claws actually rubbed together.\n\nNianbing rubbed his eyes, thinking to himself, *Did I see that right? This dragon looks so sordid. It's completely different from the Wind Dragon Kaluodili Si I saw last time. If my companions and I die, won't our belongings still be his? Why would he do this? What exactly does he want to extort?*\n\nExchanging glances with Feng Nü, Nianbing asked, \"Then what do you want?\"\n\nJialamandi Si's enormous body sat down again, significantly reducing the pressure on Nianbing and the others. \"Well, I don't want anything too good. For instance, that sword in the hands of this little broken bird's descendant is barely enough to buy her life back. As long as each of you can produce one treasure of that level, I will let you leave. But don't try to fool me with scrap metal; I, the Great and Mighty Jialamandi Si, am not that easy to fool.\"\n\nFeng Nü snapped, \"You're extorting us! Are all dragons like you?\"\n\nJialamandi Si rolled his eyelids. \"What, do you think I've disgraced the Dragon Race? Hmph, let me tell you something: after staying on this continent for a few more millennia, I will return to the God Realm, and I will be the next Dragon God of the God Realm. Exchanging items for your lives is a very fair thing. The rules are set by me; you have no right to object.\"\n\nHearing Jialamandi Si's words, Nianbing's heart instead settled. He stopped Feng Nü from arguing further, smiled calmly, and said, \"Exchanging items for lives, you say? Good. I'll exchange with you. I am willing to use all my good things to buy the lives of all my companions.\" As he spoke, he opened his Space Ring and successively took out the Sigh of the Ice Goddess, the Roar of the Fire God (which Feng Nü had returned), the Whisper of the Free Wind, and the Holy Radiance Stone. Instantly, a brilliant light radiated from the treasures in front of Nianbing, making Jialamandi Si's eyes widen with greed.\n\n\"Good, good, all these things can be exchanged. Go call your companions over.\"\n\nKaluo's body trembled slightly. \"Nianbing, you were helping us this time. How can we let you use your own things to save us? Besides, these few items of yours... I don't think we can ever repay them!\"\n\nNianbing raised his hand to stop him from speaking further. \"Guild Master Kaluo, there's no need to say more. Staying alive is the most important thing; all possessions are external. Please trouble yourself to call everyone else over.\"\n\nKaluo looked at Nianbing, and at this moment, he suddenly realized how tall Nianbing's figure seemed. Little did he know that Nianbing was also in an internal struggle. While the Whisper of the Free Wind and the Holy Radiance Stone were precious, they were indeed external possessions to him. But the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God were inlaid with the last things his parents left him; how could he bear to part with them? However, facing this greedy giant dragon, Nianbing knew that without offering enough, it would be impossible to leave this place. He could ignore the lives of Kaluo and the mercenaries, but he could not ignore Feng Nü and Long Ling. Moreover, this giant dragon, who had lived for tens of thousands of years, had probably already figured out his \"bottom line\" before trying to extort him. It was better to offer them proactively. Nianbing secretly vowed that as long as he could survive, he would find a way to get these things back someday.\n\nWith a wave of Jialamandi Si's dragon claw, the items Nianbing took out were already in front of him. He picked up the Roar of the Fire God with his dragon claw and praised, \"Good, truly good. Such fine things can only be owned by the Great and Mighty Jialamandi Si.\"\n\nFeng Nü's hand, gripping the Lituan Sword, turned somewhat white from gripping too tightly. Nianbing put his left arm around her waist, lightly squeezing a few times, signaling her not to act rashly. The items were already out; as long as they could leave here alive, everything could be re-evaluated later.\n\nIn a short while, Ziqingmeng, Long Ling, and the rest of the Ice Moon Mercenary Group were brought over by Kaluo. Upon seeing the treasures scattered on the ground, Hua Rui's eyes lit up. Just as she was about to pick one up, Kaluo pushed her back with a palm strike. Kaluo angrily said, \"What time is it, and you still can't get rid of your greed for money?\"\n\nHua Rui was stunned for a moment. When she saw the enormous body of the Fire Dragon Jialamandi Si, she immediately fell silent.\n\nNianbing coughed and said, \"Great and Mighty Jialamandi Si, all our people are here. Can we leave now?\"\n\nJialamandi Si lazily looked at Nianbing and said, \"Alright, you and that little broken bird's descendant can leave. Of course, her sword must stay. As for the others, just wait here to die.\"\n\nNianbing's head buzzed and almost exploded. \"What did you say? Even someone as great as you would go back on his word?\"\n\nJialamandi Si feigned innocence and said, \"How could the Great and Mighty Me go back on my word? Just now I only said these things of yours could buy a life, but I didn't promise to buy everyone's lives. Only your own.\"\n\nNianbing's breathing became uneven. \"Jialamandi Si, even if it's one item for one life, these items of mine can buy back four lives. Adding Feng Nü's sword, at least five of us should be able to leave.\"\n\n\"No, no, no. Don't misunderstand. How the exchange happens is up to me. If you don't want to leave, I won't object to you staying here and waiting to die with them.\" Jialamandi Si was as sly as a villain.\n\nFeng Nü was furious. \"I'll fight you to the death!\"\n\n\"Fight? If it were the little broken bird, it might have that ability, but you're too young. I didn't say no one else can leave, but they also have to exchange things. I, the Great and Mighty Jialamandi Si, have only two hobbies. One is these treasures, and the other,嘿嘿 (hehe), is food. If you have anything delicious to exchange, I might consider it. Of course, it has to be more delicious than this.\" With a wave of his dragon claw, he somehow produced a large, plump dried fish and put it into his mouth, chewing loudly.\n\nThe sudden change made Nianbing feel both amused and bewildered. *Eating... that's what I'm best at!*\n\n\"Ah! It's you, that voice that day was yours!\" Ziqingmeng suddenly exclaimed.\n\nJialamandi Si chuckled. \"Indeed, little girl, you have a good memory. That day, the thing you made called 'noodles' smelled really good. I just don't know what it tastes like. Alright then. You make some delicious food for me to taste first. If it can satisfy me, as long as only you stay to cook for me, I can let the others go.\"\n\nA strange thought suddenly arose in Nianbing's mind. *Did this Jialamandi Si make things difficult for us just to keep Ziqingmeng, who can cook? If so, then things will be much easier to resolve.* With a clear strategy in hand, Nianbing immediately calmed down and smiled faintly, \"Great and Mighty Jialamandi Si, our human food is the most exquisite. How can it be compared to that dried fish you eat? I am a human chef. If you wish, I would be delighted to serve you.\"\n\nJialamandi Si's eyes lit up. He was already tired of eating those dried fish. Just as Nianbing had judged, the lives of Nianbing's group were not important to him; what was important was being able to eat delicious food. \"You can cook too? Alright, then you do it. However, if what you make is delicious, the others can leave, but you must stay.\"\n\nHearing him say that, Nianbing couldn't help but feel a little amused. People say \"bargaining with a tiger for its skin*,\" but he was now \"bargaining with a dragon for its skin.\"\n\n\"Nianbing, let me do it instead.\" Ziqingmeng ran a few steps to Nianbing's side, looking at him with determination.\n\nNianbing shook his head. \"No, how can your culinary skills satisfy the Great and Mighty Jialamandi Si?\" Everyone has their weaknesses, and dragons are no exception. Since he had found Jialamandi Si's weakness, Nianbing was full of confidence in himself.\n\nJialamandi Si's dragon eyes flickered, looking at Nianbing and saying, \"Just talking is useless. Make something for me to taste. As long as it satisfies me, I'll let your friends go.\"\n\n\"Nianbing.\" Feng Nü urgently pulled at him.\n\nNianbing smiled slightly. \"Don't worry, nothing will happen. Don't you trust my cooking skills?\"\n\n\"But...\"\n\nNianbing stopped Feng Nü with his gaze, shaking his head slightly to signal her not to speak further. He looked up at Jialamandi Si and sighed, \"Great and Mighty Jialamandi Si, you've been sleeping here, so you probably don't know much about the outside world. In the human world, I am known as [placeholder for title/fame, e.g., 'Chef God']. Perhaps my magic cannot enter your sight at all, but it is certainly enough for cooking.\"\n\n\"Using magic to cook?\" Jialamandi Si was already somewhat impatient. His giant seated body stood up again, and his large head extended towards Nianbing. \"Then what are we waiting for? Cook for me at once!\"\n\nNianbing chuckled inwardly. *What a gluttonous giant dragon!* On his face, he displayed a look of profound sorrow. \"Great and Mighty Jialamandi Si, I am truly sorry. With my culinary skills, I would originally have absolute confidence in satisfying you. However, my right arm was broken by your subordinate just now; the muscles and bones are completely severed. My right hand can be said to be the lifeblood of us chefs! Without my right hand, how can I make something that satisfies you?\" As he spoke, Nianbing's expression appeared extremely tragic, as if he deeply regretted being unable to cook for Jialamandi Si.\n\nFeng Nü's original worries completely vanished at this moment. Looking at Nianbing, she almost burst out laughing. He was playing a trick on Jialamandi Si, and the most excellent part was that everything he said was true.\n\nJialamandi Si's gaze fell on Nianbing's right arm, which hung limply at his side. \"Muscles and bones completely broken? Oh, you were hit by that kid Jin Ni's Dragon-Guiding Arrow, weren't you?\"\n\nNianbing nodded and sighed, \"Alas, originally this was my own fault. But now I need my right hand to cook for you. However, without ninth-tier Light-element healing magic, my muscles and bones are very difficult to regenerate! Great and Mighty Jialamandi Si, do you have any good medicine you could lend me for treatment? As soon as my hand is well, I can immediately make delicious food for you.\" As a giant dragon, Jialamandi Si undoubtedly possessed extremely high intelligence, but he could never compare to human cunning. Under Nianbing's superb performance, he snorted disdainfully, \"Ninth-tier Light-element magic can cure it; why would you need medicine? Stand still. I'll heal your arm first. If you can't make something that satisfies me after that, hmph hmph, I'll cripple both your arms!\" As he spoke, he slowly raised a dragon claw, and low, whimpering sounds continuously came from his dragon mouth. Five small clumps of golden light gradually condensed on the five tips of his dragon claw. His voice was unintelligible, seemingly the language of dragons.\n\nThe golden light suddenly intensified. Jialamandi Si roared lowly, and five golden rays shot out, directly enveloping Nianbing's body. It was an incomparably pure aura. Nianbing had felt this kind of aura on the Holy Radiance Stone before. Like bathing in a spring breeze, his originally weak body felt strength blooming from within under the golden light, filled with a sense of power. Even the Ice and Fire of the Same Origin magic power vortex within his body spun even faster under the influence of this golden light. What surprised Nianbing the most was that his already numb right shoulder now felt a tingling sensation. He could even clearly feel the bones and meridians in his shoulder constantly healing. Under the nourishment of that golden light, his blood circulation gradually became unblocked, and his pale, powerless right hand regained its sensation.\n\n---\n*   **jin (斤)**: A traditional Chinese unit of weight, roughly equivalent to 500 grams or 1.1 pounds.\n*   **bargaining with a tiger for its skin (与虎谋皮)**: An idiom meaning to try to gain something from someone who is much more powerful and dangerous, often implying a futile or extremely risky endeavor.",

    "content": "Feeling his bones and muscles constantly regenerating was such a strange sensation that Nian Bing's mind became livelier. The Fire-attribute Dragon, Galamandis, no longer seemed so terrifying; at least, under certain circumstances, he could be fully utilized. Nian Bing, however, had some doubts in his heart. Galamandis was clearly a fire-attribute dragon, so where did this light-attribute magic come from? Nevertheless, no matter what doubts he had now, they couldn't compare to the joy of his severely injured body rapidly recovering. Once health was restored, everything would become possible.\n\nThe sore and swollen sensation grew stronger. Under the golden light's embrace, all negative feelings in his body continuously disappeared. Tentatively, he moved his right arm; the familiar sensation had returned, and he could freely control his right arm once more. Pulling away the cloth strips wrapped around the wound to look, he saw that the originally terrifying wound had completely vanished, leaving not even a single scar.\n\nSuddenly, the golden light transformed into blue—the sensation of water, gentle water, continuously nourishing his sore and swollen arm. Each ripple of water made his sensation of his right arm a bit stronger. Moving the five fingers of his right hand, they were still as flexible as if they had never been injured.\n\nThe light faded and vanished. The huge cave was silent. Everyone was shocked by the Fire-attribute Dragon Galamandis's peculiar magic. Both Light-attribute and Water-attribute magic were somehow used from the claws of a creature inherently fire-attributed. This strange sight had exceeded the scope of what anyone could comprehend.\n\n\"Alright, repaired with light, nourished with water, your arm is fine. We can start now, can't we?\" Galamandis spoke lazily, as if he had just performed a small, unintentional task. He smacked his huge dragon mouth, his massive dragon eyes filled with a longing light.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Of course. Please wait a moment.\" As he spoke, he took out his cooking tools one by one and then asked Lidai and Feng Yun for some ingredients. Under Galamandis's gaze, he suddenly furrowed his brow and looked back at the dragon. He said, seemingly somewhat awkwardly, \"Great Galamandis, I'm truly sorry, but could you lend me something to use? Otherwise, I can't work!\"\n\nGalamandis said somewhat impatiently, \"Lend something? Why are you so troublesome? What do you need to borrow that's related to your cooking? Kid, if you trick me, you know the consequences yourself.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled. \"How dare I trick you? But as a chef, to cook the best dishes, one needs a complete set of tools. However, my handy tools were all taken by you, so how can I cook for you? Of course, those things already belong to you, so I'd like to ask you to lend them to me first, to cook for you.\" *You know how to extort, don't I know how to play the same game?* Galamandis, let's play on. See who can outplay whom to death.\n\nGalamandis's dragon claw was as flexible as a human hand. He extended a dragon finger and pointed at the treasures he had just collected from Nian Bing. \"You mean to say, these are your kitchen knives?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Exactly so. Please lend them to me first. Don't worry, I will definitely satisfy you.\"\n\nGalamandis said discontentedly, \"Humans truly are a wasteful race. You kid are even more extravagant than me. Here, take them, take them.\" With a wave of his dragon claw, the three divine blades and the Sacred Radiance Stone returned to Nian Bing, borne aloft by a faint red light. Nian Bing suppressed his agitated feelings, bent down, and grasped the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God in his hands. That sensation, as if connected to his flesh and bone, made his whole body tremble. *Old partners, you're back again. Don't worry, no matter what, I won't let you leave me again.* As he thought this, he quickly put all these items into his Spatial Ring.\n\nWithout giving Galamandis another chance to be discontent, Nian Bing had two mercenaries help him set up the pot. After thinking for a moment, he took out a large piece of spare ribs from the ingredients he had removed and said with a slight smile, \"The facilities here are simple, so I'll make you a dish of spare ribs. I think you'll definitely like it.\" Given Galamandis's enormous size, Nian Bing didn't cut the spare ribs into pieces but directly put them into the pot. Then he used Ice-attribute magic to condense several blocks of solid ice and placed them into the pot, melting the ice with a Fire spell to turn it into water, soaking the spare ribs within.\n\nGalamandis seemed to have forgotten everyone else. He walked a few steps to Nian Bing's side, lay down, and curiously watched his movements. \"Kid, you know both Ice and Fire magic?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and smiled slightly. \"That still can't compare to you! You know at least three types of magic, while I only know two.\"\n\n\"No, no, no, it's different. The Light-attribute and Water-attribute magic I use are merely simulated, while your Ice and Fire magic are inherent. Hmm, such a physique is truly rare! But your magic level is too weak. The magic power in your body is messy, just turning and turning, what's the point?\"\n\nNian Bing didn't hear the rest of the words at all. When he heard the two words \"simulation,\" a tremendous rumble sounded in his mind. The heavy mists that were originally there instantly revealed a glimmer of dawn, as if a new door to magic had opened before him. His movements stopped, and he continuously murmured the two words \"simulation.\" He had clearly thought of something, but he still couldn't truly grasp it.\n\nGalamandis lifted a claw and lightly tapped Nian Bing on the head, making him return to his senses. \"Hey, hurry up and cook, don't dawdle, I'm already hungry.\"\n\nNian Bing came to his senses. Suppressing the excitement in his heart, he knew that now was not the time to ask, and even if he did, Galamandis wouldn't tell him. Collecting his thoughts, he rubbed his head where it had been hit and said, \"Great Galamandis, you don't know this, but after soaking these spare ribs in ice water, the meat will be even more tender. Haste makes waste*, so please wait a moment.\"\n\nGalamandis grunted, his dragon head leaning to the side of the pot, his dragon eyes revealing longing. \"No matter how hot the tofu, I can eat it in one bite. But what is tofu?\"\n\nNian Bing patiently explained, \"Tofu is a food made from beans as raw material. It has very high nutritional value and a delicious taste. If you want to eat it, I can make it for you when I have a chance later.\"\n\n\"Good, good, good. There will be many opportunities later. I'm already starting to believe you are a chef.\" Galamandis's voice became cheerful, like a child's.\n\nThe onlookers watched, dumbfounded. Nian Bing and the Fire-attribute Dragon Galamandis, together like this, no longer seemed like opposing sides but completely like friends conversing. The dragon's current appearance was quite comical: his fat rear end was sticking out behind him, his thick dragon tail swayed gently, one front claw supported his large head as he watched inside the pot, and the other dragon claw slowly tapped the ground. That expression, that appearance, was completely like a person—a diner craving delicious food.\n\nFeng Nü turned and walked towards a nearby cave wall. \"Come on, Millionaires, rest for a bit. We're preparing to leave.\"\n\nCarlo came to Feng Nü's side and whispered, \"Miss Feng Nü, will that dragon really let us leave?\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled slightly and said, \"Don't you still believe in Nian Bing's cooking skills? Satisfying this dragon's stomach is not a difficult matter for him. With Nian Bing's intelligence, there won't be a problem.\"\n\nCarlo said somewhat worriedly, \"Even if that dragon keeps its promise and lets us leave, what about Nian Bing? He came here because of our mercenary group's business. If we leave him alone, how can I be at ease? If we leave and Nian Bing dies by the dragon's hand, then...\"\n\nSeeing Carlo's sincere feelings revealed, Feng Nü couldn't help but feel a bit more favorably towards him. She smiled slightly and said, \"You can rest assured about that; at least Nian Bing's life is not in danger. I believe that as long as this dragon tastes the food he cooks, it will protect him like a treasure and wouldn't bear to harm him. As for how to leave here, that will depend on Nian Bing's own wisdom. I used to hear that dragons were gluttonous, but I never imagined they were gluttonous to this extent. Only if we all leave first, Nian Bing will have no qualms. Guild Master Carlo, was that person who just took the black bottle your employer?\"\n\nCarlo was stunned for a moment, then lowered his head and said, \"Perhaps. His voice changed, and the aura emanating from him also changed, but his physique didn't. Dark Mages actually still exist. It seems our mercenary group's future isn't optimistic once we return!\"\n\nFeng Nü shook her head and said, \"Not necessarily. Since that person is a Dark Mage, obtaining the Seal of Mu'aodas bottle that Galamandis mentioned must have some ulterior motive. You are merely a mercenary group; destroying you would not benefit him. I think true dark ones would certainly not do things that are disadvantageous to themselves. Good man, you let everyone rest for a bit.\"\n\nAs they conversed, Nian Bing on his side had already started. He took out the spare ribs soaked in ice water and placed them on a chopping board nearby. He cast a Fire spell under the pot, beginning to heat the ice water. At the same time, he added Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, scallion segments, ginger slices, and more than ten other seasonings to the ice water. Under the effect of the flames, the water in the pot soon boiled. The aroma of various seasonings spread with the boiling water. Galamandis sniffed continuously, loudly exclaiming how fragrant it was. That excitement! How could he still seem like a dragon that had lived for tens of thousands of years?\n\n\"Kid, when can I eat these spare ribs? I'm getting a bit impatient! Hurry up, hurry up!\" Galamandis continuously urged.\n\nHe was anxious, but Nian Bing was not in a hurry at all. He said calmly, \"The more delicious something is, the more troublesome it is to cook. Especially a whole piece of spare ribs like this, it's very difficult to make it fully flavored. To make it delicious, there must be three conditions: first, the heat must be even; second, the flavor must penetrate evenly; and third, there must be a mixture of multiple delicious flavors. If you want ordinary stewed spare ribs, I can make it for you right away. But if you want supreme large spare ribs, then you'll have to wait a little longer. Which one do you want to eat?\"\n\nGalamandis swallowed a mouthful of dragon saliva and said somewhat dejectedly, \"I'll wait, then. I'll wait. How much longer?! I'm hungry.\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"It won't be too long. Don't talk to me. If you interrupt my cooking flow, the taste of what's made will change. Do you want to eat substandard quality then?\"\n\n\"No, no, no, I won't disturb you, you cook, you cook.\" To eat delicious food, Galamandis had now completely put down his airs, blinking his dragon eyes and waiting.\n\nNian Bing chuckled inwardly. *Galamandis, oh Galamandis, as long as I conquer your appetite, I don't believe you'll still harm me. As for who drives whom later, perhaps that's still uncertain.*\n\nUnder the influence of magic, the Sacred Radiance Pearl jumped into his hand. Nian Bing made the light of the Sacred Radiance Pearl shine on the whole piece of spare ribs. After a few breaths, he put the Sacred Radiance Pearl away, picked up a bottle of wine from the side, and evenly spread it on the spare ribs. After the first coat was applied, he immediately took out the Sigh of the Ice Goddess. Under the activation of ice elements, the Morning Dew Blade lightly cut the surface of the spare ribs 256 times in succession, leaving 256 marks. Then he turned the spare ribs over, and after similarly cutting 256 marks with the True Sun Blade, he applied a second coating of wine. As he spread it, he deliberately explained to Galamandis, \"The two different magic elements, ice and fire, fuse onto this piece of spare ribs under the effect of the wine. Because I use different amounts of ice and fire elements, nine different flavors can be conjured from it. The wine can remove the gamey smell from the spare ribs and bring out the meat's aroma. Coupled with the invasion of both ice and fire magic elements, it can make the spare ribs cook more easily, and the meat will taste even better. Great Galamandis, please light a small fire over here, a small pile of fire will suffice.\"\n\nTo quickly eat these delicious spare ribs, Galamandis didn't bother to ponder why Nian Bing was asking him to light a fire. With a flick of his dragon finger, a pile of flames immediately appeared on the ground. Nian Bing tossed the spare ribs with a casual hand, and they immediately flew onto the flames and began to flip. When it was about to land, Nian Bing alternately used the Morning Dew Blade and True Sun Blade to lift it, keeping the spare ribs continuously flipping. The aroma of wine and meat diffused in the grilling flames, mixing with the aroma of the seasoning broth over there. Galamandis had unknowingly drooled, and the longing in his dragon eyes grew even stronger.\n\nWhen the spare ribs were half-cooked, Nian Bing used the Morning Dew Blade to pierce them, stopping the grilling process. He walked to the side of the pot and used a strainer to scoop out the various seasonings, leaving only a pot of broth brewed from the seasonings. The spare ribs went into the pot. Nian Bing covered the pot well, murmured a few incantations, and purple flames rose from his hands. He pressed them onto both sides of the pot respectively, causing heat to continuously transfer into the pot. At the same time, he turned his head and said to Galamandis, \"Help me hold down the pot lid. Don't let a single drop of broth overflow, otherwise it'll lose its flavor*.\"\n\n---\n*   \"Haste makes waste\" (心急吃不了熱豆腐 - literally \"cannot eat hot tofu in a hurry\").\n*   \"Otherwise it'll lose its flavor\" (跑味兒了 - literally \"the flavor will run/escape\").",

    "content": "「Okay.\" Galmandis swallowed again, quickly pressing his dragon claw onto the pot lid. Steam continuously pushed up, but he couldn't push the lid open at all. Only wisps of hot air escaped from the small holes on the lid. The perfect combination of meat aroma and soup gave off an enticing rich fragrance. Let alone Galmandis, even the mercenary group members nearby were constantly swallowing their saliva.\n\nAfter a while, Nian Bing withdrew his magic, saying, \"Alright, stop pressing.\" Galmandis lifted his claw. Nian Bing opened the lid and quickly added some soy sauce and salt. He let the soup boil, allowing the seasonings to blend with the broth and the ribs. Adding salt last when stewing meat was very particular; because, while adding salt at the beginning made it easier for the flavor to penetrate, the meat would be hard to stew until tender, and the taste would be much worse. He took out the Heaven's Pride Blade, and under Galmandis's fierce gaze, directly cut off a small piece of meat from the pot, blew on the hot steam, and gently chewed it in his mouth.\n\nGalmandis saw Nian Bing's enraptured eating expression and immediately flew into a rage. He raised his dragon claw, just about to slap it down to punish this human who dared to eat *his* food, but then he heard Nian Bing say, \"Hmm, not bad. Though a bit rushed, it's barely edible.\" Galmandis's dragon claw instantly stopped mid-air. He excitedly said, \"It's edible? That's great!\" The arduous wait had finally come to an end.\n\nNian Bing again used the Heaven's Pride Blade to pick up a small piece of rib meat and nodded towards Galmandis. Galmandis didn't stand on ceremony; his right claw directly plunged into the scorching pot, grabbed a large piece of rib, and shoved the entire thing into his mouth, chewing loudly. The smacking sounds continuously echoed, making Nian Bing frown. An entire rib, after just a few chews, was completely devoured by Galmandis.\n\nNian Bing, frowning, said, \"How's the taste, great Galmandis?\"\n\nGalmandis's dragon eyes were full of intoxication. \"Delicious, truly very delicious!\"\n\nNian Bing stared at him and said, \"Just delicious?\"\n\nGalmandis said, puzzled, \"Isn't 'delicious' enough? For *my* great Galmandis to say something you made is delicious, that is your honor.\"\n\nThis time, it was Nian Bing's turn to snort disdainfully, saying, \"What kind of deliciousness can you taste by gulping it down like that? You've wasted all my painstaking effort.\"\n\nGalmandis paused, \"Is there anything else particular about eating? Don't you just chew a few times and swallow?\"\n\nNian Bing said proudly, \"There are particulars to cooking, and there are particulars to eating as well. Qingmeng, come here.\" Nian Bing gestured to Zi Qingmeng, who was standing nearby. Zi Qingmeng walked to him, perplexed. Nian Bing handed her the rib meat on the Heaven's Pride Blade, saying, \"Taste it, then tell our great Galmandis what flavors are in these ribs I made.\"\n\nZi Qingmeng took the Heaven's Pride Blade. She brought the rib meat to her mouth, chewing slowly and meticulously. After a while, her eyes gleamed with admiration as she said, \"Because of the effects of your two types of magic, the ribs transform into a hundred different flavors. The rib meat is tender and richly fragrant, aromatic without being greasy. The most unique thing is how the wine aroma, under the influence of your magic, remains within the rib meat, and combined with the various seasonings, it has thoroughly permeated. This makes the rib meat perfectly merge the flavors of the seasonings with the meat's own aroma, combined with the rich wine fragrance and the magical transformations – truly a delicacy on earth! Especially the mastery of the heat, it's just right. I certainly couldn't make such a dish.\"\n\nNian Bing took the Heaven's Pride Blade that Zi Qingmeng handed back, then turned to Galmandis and said, \"Did you hear that? What I make must be savored carefully to taste its true essence. Only by knowing how to appreciate it can one find the greatest pleasure in food. Eating it casually like you do, you'll only taste a bit of its aroma and can only comment that it's 'delicious.' Don't you think such a delicious dish, once eaten, is too much of a waste?\"\n\nGalmandis blinked, muttering, \"What you said seems to make some sense, but what should I do?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Since you're planning to keep me here, we'll have plenty of time in the future to exchange culinary insights. I know how to make many dishes. Shouldn't you also fulfill your promise and send my friends away? As long as you want to eat, I can make delicious food for you anytime.\"\n\nGalmandis's gaze swept over the people standing nearby. He hesitated for a moment, then said, \"Alright, but I have one more condition.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned and said, \"Another condition? Great Galmandis, you must live up to your 'great' title. Words spoken are like spilled water.\"\n\nGalmandis chuckled, \"Of course, my words count, but you brat are clearly very cunning. I have to guard against you, otherwise, how will I control you later? How about this: you attack me once, then I'll have the right to take your life at any time. With a threat to your life, I won't be afraid of you brat not complying. As soon as you attack me, I'll immediately send your friends out.\" A giant dragon who had lived for tens of thousands of years was certainly not that easy to deal with. At this point, Nian Bing had no choice left.\n\nWithout any hesitation, Nian Bing ignored the anxious protests of Feng Nu, Long Ling, and the others, and casually swung the Heaven's Pride Blade. A wind blade elegantly emerged, striking Galmandis's body, yet leaving not even a trace. Galmandis, somewhat excited, let out an earth-shattering dragon roar. Red light emanated from his massive body, instantly enveloping Feng Nu and over thirty other people. With a flap of his dragon wings, he created a gust that sent Nian Bing stumbling and falling to the ground. Galmandis, carrying Feng Nu and the others, flew high into the sky, ascending into the air.\n\nLong Ling, her eyes misty with tears, shouted towards Nian Bing, \"Nian Bing, you must live! You promised to tell me something!\"\n\nFeng Nu also shouted, \"Nian Bing, you must live! Only by living will you have a chance for revenge! Perhaps, I'll even consider being your girlfriend!\"\n\nZi Qingmeng likewise shouted, \"My brother and I will go to the capital of the Oland Empire to join the Silver Feather Mercenary Group. If you can leave here alive, come find us there!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and waved at everyone, not showing a hint of sadness on his face. \"Feng Nu, remember what you said. Ling'er, give me a chance, don't marry Shi Jiu.\"\n\nTears streamed uncontrollably from Long Ling's beautiful eyes. \"Idiot, I was lying to you that day. I'm not engaged at all! I'll be waiting for you in Ice Snow City. Even if it's for an entire lifetime. You promised Dad you'd go to the New Generation Mage Tournament. For our sake, you must live!\"\n\n\"Aren't you annoying? Is parting life and death so interesting?\" Galmandis suddenly accelerated his flight. Long Ling and Feng Nu's voices could no longer be heard.\n\nWatching their departing figures, Nian Bing's gaze was somewhat hazy. In this enormous cave, with a dragon for company, how easy would it be to leave? For now, he could only take one step at a time. He hoped this \"great\" Galmandis would always be so fond of eating. That way, he could at least survive. He glanced at his right hand, which was moving freely. Nian Bing simply sat down beside Galmandis's pile of treasures. He was neither optimistic nor pessimistic about his current predicament. In his mind, he recalled the term \"mimicry,\" pondering how he should continue cultivating his ice-fire dual-source magic. Rather than hoping for luck, it was better to diligently improve his strength. Although he didn't hope to contend with the Fire Dragon Galmandis, as long as his strength improved, there would always be an opportunity. Since his parents were trapped in the Ice God Tower, he had developed a resilient character that never gave up.\n\nNot long after, the ground trembled. The \"great\" Galmandis had returned. \"Brat, I've fulfilled my promise and safely sent your friends away.\"\n\nWith no more worries, Nian Bing coldly looked at Galmandis and said, \"So, I should thank you then? By the way, I'm not 'brat.' My name is Nian Bing.\"\n\nGalmandis said with slight anger, \"Bastard, is that how you talk to the great Galmandis? Don't forget, you've already attacked me. I can take your life at any time.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"I doubt you'd be willing to. After eating what I've made, I don't believe you'd be interested in other food anymore. How about we make a trade? You tell me what magic mimicry is all about, and I'll teach you how to savor delicacies. How does that sound?\"\n\nGalmandis snorted, \"You're thinking too much. Remember, you're just a humble human, with no right whatsoever to bargain with the great Galmandis.\" No sooner had he finished speaking than Nian Bing felt his entire body tighten. He had been lifted by Galmandis's enormous dragon claw. A scorching aura invaded his body, and his cloth clothes instantly turned to ash. Galmandis casually flicked him, sending Nian Bing crashing to the ground. Dozens of scratches immediately appeared on his skin from the uneven surface, and the intense pain made Nian Bing groan. His mind blurred, and he instantly fainted.\n\n\"Hey, hey, you're not that frail, are you?\" Galmandis was startled to see Nian Bing fall to the ground and become unresponsive. Of course, he didn't care about Nian Bing's life or death, but he cared deeply about his own food—something he had never experienced before. Fearing Nian Bing would just die like that, he quickly released a Light-element healing magic on him. The wounds instantly healed. Galmandis checked Nian Bing's physical condition, then contentedly lay down to sleep.\n\nWhen Nian Bing regained consciousness, the daylight above the cave had already darkened. He found that his body felt no discomfort; although his magic power wasn't abundant, he still had about fifty percent left. He cast a Flame Spell to illuminate everything around him. The giant dragon Galmandis was lying there asleep, and his treasures shimmered under the firelight. With a stir in his heart, he loudly called Galmandis's name, but the giant dragon was sleeping soundly and didn't respond no matter how he called. Nian Bing felt a surge of joy. Although he wasn't sure if he could escape, how would he know if he didn't try?\n\n\"Great Goddess of Ice and Snow! Please lend me your wrath, and guide us to the lost shore. —Blizzard!\" Ice elements converged beneath his feet. Nian Bing carefully controlled the magic energy, not letting even a wisp escape, and slowly floated up, drifting towards the cave ceiling. The power of Blizzard was originally insufficient to carry him so high, but he possessed the Lament of the Ice Goddess. With the help of the supreme Ice-element gem, the Ice Goddess's Stone, the effect of Blizzard was greatly enhanced, carrying his body higher and higher. At first, when he reached a hundred zhang*, Nian Bing was afraid of waking Galmandis, so he flew very slowly. But after passing a hundred zhang, Galmandis still showed no reaction. This discovery made him bolder, and he accelerated with full power, using Blizzard to propel his body upward.\n\nThe cave entrance grew closer and closer. Nian Bing could already see the twinkling stars in the night sky, and the moon hung like a jade plate in the distant heavens. Seeing all this, his eyes couldn't help but well up slightly. Could he finally escape? Just as Nian Bing reached the top of the cave, preparing to fly out, an enormous head suddenly appeared before him. \"Hey, Nian Bing brat, where do you think you're going?\" The voice was familiar, and red light illuminated the surroundings. The owner of that enormous head was none other than the Fire Dragon Galmandis. Nian Bing's heart sank. Just as he was about to say something, Galmandis's dragon claw lightly flicked. The blizzard beneath his feet instantly vanished without a trace. When he tried to use magic again, his body was already restrained by Galmandis's Fire-element magic. A feeling of weightlessness instantly washed over him, and his body plummeted towards the ground like a meteor.\n\n*It's over.* This was Nian Bing's first thought after his body began to fall. Falling from such a height, probably not a single bone would be intact. The intense feeling of weightlessness made Nian Bing forget everything. Memories constantly flickered in his mind. At that moment, what he first remembered were his parents' despairing eyes just before he activated that spatial scroll. *Dad, Mom, Nian Bing won't be able to avenge you.*\n\nSuddenly, his whole body lightened. Nian Bing realized that something seemed to have caught him. His downward plummet turned into a lateral shift. His body shook, and he began to spin and float. Only when he settled down did he realize that he was actually on Galmandis's broad dragon back. \"Trying to run so soon? You humans truly have no integrity.\" Judging from the voice, Galmandis didn't seem to be angry.\n\nDropping back to the bottom of the cave, Galmandis shook Nian Bing off his back, sending him flying, then pinched his body with a dragon claw and placed him on the ground. Because Galmandis was emitting red light representing fire, Nian Bing could clearly see everything around him. Being clever, he didn't ask Galmandis why he didn't kill him. He looked up at him and said, \"Are you hungry?\"\n\nGalmandis paused, clearly not expecting Nian Bing to react this way. He subconsciously nodded and said, \"Those few ribs you made aren't even enough to stick in my teeth.\"\n***\n*Zang (丈): A traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or 10.9 feet.",

    "title": "Chapter 66: Dragon King’s Specialty Cook (Part 1)",
    "content": "Nianbing chuckled, \"Then I'll make you something else to eat.\"\n\nHearing this, Galamandis immediately became excited. \"Good, good, hurry up and make it. Your friends left a lot of ingredients, probably enough for me to eat several meals. Hmm, I'll grant you an honor: from now on, you're the great Galamandis's exclusive chef.\"\n\nNianbing nodded. \"Cooking is no problem, but I want to know how you got up there? Your body is so big; if you'd flown past me, I should have known!\"\n\nGalamandis snorted. \"Fool, have you forgotten what I said about mimicry? I can mimic Light magic and Water magic, so why can't I mimic Spatial magic? A seven-tier mid-range instant teleportation is enough for these several thousand *zhang*.\"¹\n\nNianbing suddenly understood. \"So you can mimic any type of magic? Even Dark magic?\"\n\nGalamandis said proudly, \"Of course. Our Dragon race are born magic users; we can easily use what you humans call Forbidden Spells. Even other types of magic can be mimicked based on our own magic. The essence of magic² is actually quite similar; although the forms of each magic element are different, as long as you master the changes in magic fluctuations, you can mimic any type of magic you want. Of course, this is impossible for you humans, but we Dragons can mimic all magic from other types, including those below ninth-tier and even ninth-tier spells.\"\n\n\"Mimicry.\" Although Galamandis spoke very vaguely, it still gave Nianbing some hints: \"Mimicry.\" If Dragons can mimic, then can humans, mages, mimic to a certain extent?\n\nPerhaps humans don't have the Dragons' innate advantage, but he himself possessed both Ice and Fire magic. If, when circulating the two types of magic, he made one mimic the form of the other, then the Ice and Fire of the Same Origin would no longer pose any threat. Not only would cultivation be more convenient, but with just a slight change, the power of Ice and Fire of the Same Origin could be better demonstrated. However, to perform mimicry, one must better understand the similarities and various changes within Ice and Fire magic themselves, which would require a long period of comprehension to achieve.\n\nCooking for a dragon was absolutely a very arduous task. How big was a dragon's stomach? The ingredients Nianbing and his friends brought were enough for over thirty people to eat for a month. Yet, Galamandis ate one-third of them in a single meal. Although Nianbing tried to make simple dishes, finishing this meal still exhausted him terribly. He casually ate a little something, then sat aside, panting heavily.\n\nGalamandis slowly ate the delicious vegetables in front of him. \"Nianbing kid, is this how you eat slowly to get the best taste of food? Why don't I taste any of the changes you mentioned!?\"\n\nNianbing said exasperatedly, \"Boss, don't forget, you're a dragon after all. How can a dragon's sense of taste be the same as a human's? It seems your taste buds aren't sensitive enough, so naturally, you can't taste the deliciousness.\"\n\nGalamandis stopped eating and said angrily, \"Damn it, why didn't you tell me earlier, you brat? You made me eat so much without ever grasping the best taste.\"\n\nNianbing paused, then chuckled, \"Tell you earlier? What use would that be? Wouldn't you still eat like this anyway?\" Although their time together hadn't been long, Nianbing found that Galamandis, apart from being a bit arrogant, didn't seem that difficult to get along with. At least when Nianbing cooked for him, he was incredibly well-behaved, even helping out. His craving for food was like that of a gluttonous child. Since he couldn't leave here anytime soon, he simply relaxed, and getting along with Galamandis was no longer so uncomfortable.\n\n\"Nonsense, of course, telling me earlier would be useful. What are humans? If I transform into a *human form*, won't I have human taste buds?\" Under Nianbing's astonished gaze, the red light on Galamandis's body suddenly rippled like water, continuously concentrating on his colossal form. Gradually, the red light grew stronger, its blinding brilliance preventing Nianbing from seeing anything in front of him. The red light suddenly receded, and when Nianbing regained his vision, he was dumbfounded to find that Galamandis's massive body was gone, replaced by a human—a young man who looked to be around Nianbing's age.\n\nThis person was about the same height as Nianbing, with fiery red hair. Although not as handsome as Nianbing, he exuded a wild and domineering aura. A dark red warrior robe accentuated his perfect physique, his presence radiating an extremely dangerous feeling. He chuckled, then said to Nianbing, \"How about that? Didn't expect it, did you? There's nothing on this continent that the great Galamandis cannot accomplish.\" He awkwardly moved his transformed *human* body, then, with a flash, appeared before Nianbing.\n\nNianbing said, dumbfounded, \"You, you're really Galamandis?\"\n\nGalamandis raised a hand and tapped him on the head. \"Fool, you forgot to add the three words 'the great'.\" Having transformed into a human, his demeanor felt more real. Facing this person who seemed to be of similar age, Nianbing couldn't help but reveal a bitter smile. Creatures like dragons truly could not be speculated about using human ways of thinking.\n\nGalamandis continued eating the vegetables in the large basin. \"Huh, the taste really is different. Human taste buds are much better! Damn it, I really lost out before; it seems being human is better.\" Although he had taken human form, his stomach was still a dragon's stomach; his appetite showed no decrease at all. He ate all the food Nianbing had made in one go, then patted his belly contentedly and lay down on his pile of treasures. \"Nianbing, I finally experienced those taste changes you talked about. It's truly amazing! Is all the food you humans make this wondrous?\"\n\nNianbing had already stabilized his mind while Galamandis was eating. He walked over and sat down beside him. \"Not entirely. But for me, culinary art is a special culture, and human culinary culture is vast and boundless. There are many delicious things even I haven't seen. Among humans, I am indeed an excellent chef, but I can't say I'm the best.\"\n\nGalamandis flipped over in surprise to look at Nianbing. \"So, there's even better food out there?\"\n\nNianbing smiled slightly. \"Of course there is. If there's a chance in the future, I can take you to experience it.\" After Galamandis transformed into human form, Nianbing's initial fear inexplicably diminished greatly. \"Great Galamandis, didn't you lose that Maodasi Seal Bottle? Why do you seem not anxious at all?\"\n\nGalamandis snorted. \"What's there to be anxious about? There's more than one Maodasi Seal Bottle. There are six in total: one with me and the other five with the other Dragon Kings, excluding the Dark Dragon King. Unless all of them are obtained, a single one is completely useless. It must be retrieved, but there's no rush right now.\"\n\nNianbing asked curiously, \"What exactly is this Maodasi Seal Bottle? And why do you six Dragon Kings need to guard it?\"\n\nGalamandis's expression subtly changed. \"You don't need to know that. Knowing this secret won't do you any good. Also, remember this: I am a Dragon King. Not a giant dragon.\"\n\n\"Dragon King? What's the difference between a Dragon King and a giant dragon? Weren't you sent by the Dragon God to guard the continent?\" Nianbing's curiosity was very strong.\n\nGalamandis said proudly, \"After the Ancient War, many races on the Yangguang Continent were annihilated. The God Realm felt that our Dragon race was no longer suitable to continue existing on this continent because we were simply too powerful for humans. So, Dragon God Grandmaster wanted to take our Dragon race to the God Realm. At that time, Dragon God Grandmaster decided to leave one giant dragon from each type to guard the continent and let us, the seven great Dragon Kings, choose our own subordinates. Those six guys were truly cunning. They all chose to stay behind themselves, and of course, I wasn't going to be outdone.\"\n\nNianbing said, \"Do gods truly exist? What's wrong with the God Realm? Why weren't you willing to go?\"\n\nGalamandis said, \"Gods are bullshit; the so-called gods are all things you humans speak of. In fact, those gods are also humans, merely powerful humans. Before the Ancient War era, the various magic elements on the continent were much denser than they are now. It was during that time that a portion of you humans, being quite far-sighted, continuously cultivated assiduously, finally reaching extremely high levels, completely surpassing human capabilities – these are what you call gods. These individuals, who call themselves gods, relied on their powerful magic to re-open a place on another continent next to this one and sealed that continent with powerful magic. That is what I call the God Realm. So, things like the God Realm, Demon Realm, and so on, all exist together. Of course, the God Realm is impossible for you humans to find; even if your navigation technology were highly developed, due to the miraculous barrier protecting the God Realm, you couldn't even discover its existence. However, those who call themselves gods are extremely arrogant and jointly established a treaty not to interfere with humans. While humans certainly cannot easily go to the God Realm, the so-called gods there cannot return to your Human Realm's continent either. Otherwise, once discovered, they would be attacked by all other gods. We Dragon Kings are the highest-ranking existences here in your Human Realm. If we were to go to that so-called Continent of Gods, we would only be above ordinary giant dragons, subjected to the command of those gods. I have no interest in being controlled by others, so naturally, staying in the Human Realm is best.\"\n\nNianbing heard the origin of gods for the first time in this manner. After thinking for a moment, he said, \"So, that means humans can also cultivate to become gods? If I diligently cultivate to the realm of gods, will I be able to enter that so-called God Realm?\"\n\nGalamandis nodded. \"That's natural. However, things aren't like they used to be. Cultivating to the realm of those gods isn't an easy feat. Your human lifespan is limited, and in the past ten thousand years or so, I haven't seen any Emissaries of the God Realm come here to take anyone to the God Realm. But, it seems there's a mage now who is close to godhood; perhaps she has a chance.\"\n\nNianbing's body jolted. \"Are you talking about the Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess from the Ice God Tower?\"\n\nGalamandis glanced at Nianbing. \"That human girl. I truly don't know how she cultivated; she's an extremely devout believer in gods, cultivating bitterly for over a hundred years – it must have been tough on her. Always maintaining her *virgin body* since childhood cultivation gave her an advantage ordinary humans don't have, which is why she could reach what you humans call the God-Appointed Master realm. However, she still has several hurdles to clear before becoming a true god. Last time I met that Ice Dragon fellow, we talked about her. Even now, we probably can't truly harm her. That little girl's magic is indeed formidable.\"\n\n\"What? Even you can't deal with the Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess?\" Nianbing's entire body trembled violently, as if drenched in ice water, feeling a chill all over. He had witnessed the might of the giant dragons, but he never expected that even someone as proud as Galamandis would admit to being unable to kill the Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess. How could he possibly contend with such a powerful enemy?\n\nGalamandis said, \"What, do you have a grudge against that girl? If so, I advise you to quickly forget about it. That girl already possesses what's called a semi-divine body, just one step away from the realm of gods. Within ten years, she will certainly enter the God Realm, and an Emissary of the God Realm will come to take her away. According to that Ice Dragon fellow, this girl already knew about the existence of the God Realm when she was very young and has been diligently cultivating Ice magic precisely to go to the God Realm. Over a hundred years of effort for this single goal. Do you think you can surpass her?\"\n\nNianbing's mind was constantly flickering with various thoughts. \"No, no matter how powerful someone is, they have flaws. As long as I'm willing to work hard, anything is possible.\"\n\nGalamandis gave a strange laugh. \"Of course, it's possible. That girl isn't flawless either. As for you, if you can break her *virgin body*, then her Ice elemental energy will be dispelled, and she will forever be unable to enter that realm of gods.\"\n\nNianbing paused. \"Do mages need a virgin body to cultivate to the extreme? I've never heard of that.\"\n\nGalamandis snorted. \"That's just your ignorance. What do you mages nowadays understand? The little magic you know is nothing but ordinary. Mages generally don't need a virgin body to cultivate to the extreme; as long as you're willing to work hard, with the current level of magic elements on the continent, you should be able to reach the realm of gods in about three or four hundred years. But you'd have to live that long. As for that girl you mentioned who practices Ice magic, she took a shortcut: cultivating with a virgin body. Coupled with her diligence and many auxiliary magical items, that's how she reached her current realm in just over a hundred years. Kid, if you have a grudge against her, just break her virgin body and shatter her dream of entering the God Realm; that would be revenge for everything. You don't always have to kill to get revenge. Heh heh, if you want revenge, making the other person suffer the most is true revenge! How about it? If you get a chance, just *rape* her. I'll support you. I'll go with you and watch the show. What do you say?\"\n\n---\n¹ *Zhang* (丈) is a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters (11 feet).\n² The original phrase (魔法的西湖, lit. \"West Lake of magic\") appears to be a transcription error or an unusual idiom.

    "content": "Nian Bing’s expression changed repeatedly. Although Galamandis looked very lewd now, his words didn’t seem false. “Cut it out. I have no interest in that old hag. Besides, would you let me go?”\n\nGalamandis chuckled, saying, “Of course, I can’t let you go. Actually, even if you wanted to rape her, it would be difficult to succeed. Unless you have greater strength than her. But that’s impossible, at least not within a hundred years. Nian Bing, kid, to be frank, although that girl is a bit old, her physical functions have been very well preserved due to years of cultivating ice magic, no different from a maiden. It’s a pity you can’t do it. Otherwise, raping her would indeed be a good option. You could enjoy yourself and get revenge—how wonderful!”\n\nNian Bing stared at him dumbfounded, saying, “I really doubt now whether you’re actually a dragon. Are all dragons like you?”\n\nGalamandis snorted, saying, “In this world, to survive better, you must know how to adapt and prioritize your own interests. It’s precisely because I understand this that I can become a candidate for the next Dragon God. Kid, don’t tell me you want to get revenge openly and honorably.”\n\n“Of course not. As long as I can get revenge, I’ll do anything.” A faint cold light flickered in his eyes, and Nian Bing clenched his fists.\n\nGalamandis leisurely said, “It seems you really have a grudge against that little girl from Ice God’s Tower! However, if you want revenge, you’d better be quick. In ten years, she’ll be going to the Divine Realm. What chance will you have then?”\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly, “Can I still get revenge in my current state? Will you let me out?”\n\nGalamandis chuckled, saying, “I only said I wouldn’t let you go, but I never said you couldn’t leave. Didn’t you just say there were a lot of good things to eat outside? We can go out and take a look. You’re familiar with humans, so as long as you can lead me to delicious food, we don’t necessarily have to stay here. Do you think I want to stay here all day? It’s just that Lord Dragon God made me cultivate the Dragon God’s Supreme Incantation, so I had no choice but to stay here. Now that my incantation has achieved success, I can finally go out and play. Only a ghost would want to stay here!”\n\nHearing this, Nian Bing’s heart stirred. “Are you saying you want to take me out of here to taste delicacies all over the continent?”\n\nGalamandis waved his hand, saying, “No, no, no, don’t get it wrong. It’s not me taking you out, but you taking me out to taste delicacies. Of course, you have to listen to me.”\n\nNian Bing smiled. He hadn’t expected that before he could find a way to leave, Galamandis would propose leaving to eat good food everywhere. Wouldn’t that mean he could go wherever he wanted? Although his freedom would be restricted to some extent, from another perspective, having Galamandis accompany him would undoubtedly be like having an invincible bodyguard by his side!\n\n“Oh, great Galamandis! I have something I’d like to discuss with you.” Nian Bing had already made his calculations.\n\nGalamandis snorted, saying, “Discuss what? I thought you’d forgotten how to address me.”\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, “How could I forget? It’s my honor to cook for you. However, as you know, as your chef, if my magic is too weak, wouldn’t that be an embarrassment for you? When I came, I seemed to see quite a few magic books here. If I could learn some other things, perhaps I could come up with even better cooking methods. What do you think, wouldn’t it be...”\n\nGalamandis’s eyes widened. “Oh! You actually dare to covet my treasures. Don’t dream about it. Those magic books are written in ancient script; even if I gave them to you, you wouldn’t be able to understand them.”\n\nNian Bing said, a little disappointed, “You really can’t understand any of it? That’s such a shame. It seems that if we encounter danger, only you can protect me. It’s a pity you can’t directly attack humans, and my magic is too weak.”\n\nGalamandis tilted his head, looking at Nian Bing. “Kid, you don’t need to scheme against me. Given that the food you make is indeed delicious, when I’m happy, I’ll naturally guide you on some magic techniques. However, you must satisfy my stomach. If I get tired of your cooking, I might just twist your head off.”\n\nNian Bing was overjoyed. For such a powerful being as Galamandis, receiving some guidance from him on magic would naturally be of great help to his ice and fire of the same origin magic. He quickly said, “Rest assured, as one of the top chefs on Yangguang Continent, what I make will definitely satisfy you. Then, can you teach me about mimicry magic now? You know I have two types of magic, but I can’t control them well now, which limits my development in magic. It will be very difficult to advance to a higher realm.”\n\n“I’m tired, let’s talk about it later. You should first recover your magical energy. Once all these ingredients are eaten up, we’ll leave here and find good things to eat outside.”\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking, Galamandis was already emitting loud snores. Although in human form, his dragon snores were enough to shake the entire cave.\n\nEat until full then sleep—isn’t that a pig? Nian Bing secretly cursed in his heart, helplessly shook his head, and sat down to the side. He didn’t immediately begin meditating, but instead thought about Galamandis’s words.\n\nIf, as he said, the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess cultivated for a hundred years to reach her current realm, that’s simply too terrifying. Is the gap between a Magus and a God-descender really that vast?\n\nHe remembered his father once saying that his mother was punished and imprisoned by the Snow Goddess Priestess precisely because she secretly conceived him with his father. Perhaps the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess wanted his mother to inherit her position, and chose to cultivate using the method of chastity.\n\nGalamandis said that if he broke the Goddess Priestess’s chastity, that would be the best revenge. Forget it. Although he wasn’t a gentleman, he had no interest in a hundred-plus-year-old hag. Her age was enough to be his great-grandmother.\n\nIce and Snow Goddess Priestess, just you wait. Even if my strength can’t catch up to yours, I’ll definitely find a way to make you regret it.\n\nHe closed his eyes. Nian Bing stabilized his mind and began to enter a meditative state, holding the Lament of the Ice and Snow Goddess and the Roar of the God of Flame in his hands respectively, absorbing the magic elements from the air.\n\nIn fact, he himself didn’t know that his magic cultivation speed was much faster than that of ordinary mages. This was not only related to him being a dual-element mage who could absorb two types of magic simultaneously, but more importantly, to the Lament of the Ice and Snow Goddess and the Roar of the God of Flame. Although these two top-tier divine stones didn’t show much effect normally, they seemed only to make magic more powerful when used and to conserve magical energy.\n\nDuring his regular cultivation, the special energies possessed by the two divine stones had been subtly transforming Nian Bing’s physique and making his magical energy purer. A simple example can show this: Lita was a Magus, but in terms of sustained combat ability and the power of his magic when used, he definitely couldn’t compare to Nian Bing for magic of the same rank.\n\nAlthough his magical power was great, in terms of purity, it still couldn’t compare to even one of Nian Bing’s types of magic.\n\nWhat Nian Bing was currently undergoing was a foundational process. As long as his foundation could be built extremely solidly, then he could become a powerful mage in the future.\n\nThe Fire Dragon God Galamandis could naturally see this. However, in his eyes, Nian Bing was so insignificant. Naturally, he wouldn’t remind him.\n\nThree days passed. When it came to clearing out food, Galamandis was absolutely first-rate. In his human form, his eating speed had slowed down considerably, but he could eat continuously. Nian Bing’s cooking speed was just enough to keep him fed. Over three days, the two repeated the same routine: Galamandis ate, slept, and ate, while Nian Bing cooked and meditated. Fortunately, Galamandis was still considerate enough to leave some food for Nian Bing when he ate. As he continuously ate, the food ingredients Carlo and the others had left behind finally ran out.\n\nLying contentedly on his treasures, Galamandis sighed, “It’s truly wonderful. To think that I, the great Galamandis, have lived for tens of thousands of years, yet only these past few days have been the most satisfying in terms of eating. Nian Bing, you really weren’t boasting. The dishes you make vary in flavor. Now I’m increasingly longing for the outside world.”\n\nNian Bing said grumpily, “You’re having a great time eating, but I’m almost exhausted to death. If you eat like this every day, it won’t be long before I’m finished first.”\n\nGalamandis chuckled, saying, “No way, how could I bear to work you to death? Oh, right, haven’t you noticed that although your body has been tired these past few days, your spirit is much better? And your magic has progressed quite a bit?”\n\nNian Bing snorted angrily, saying, “That’s the result of my own efforts. Plus, the fire elements here are abundant, and I cook for you every day, so my spirit is constantly in a state of fatigue. Forget progress, I’m almost tired into human jerky.”\n\nGalamandis patted Nian Bing’s shoulder, saying, “Alright, alright, stop complaining. Anyway, you’ll soon get out of misery. It’s not like I must have good food every day. For me, eating is just a kind of enjoyment. Your hard days are over. Since there are no more ingredients, we’ll leave today. I’ll teach you some magic insights as a reward, how about that?”\n\nNian Bing’s eyes lit up, saying, “You’re willing to teach me? It won’t be some trashy insights, will it? Don’t forget, I’m human and you’re a dragon. Our physical structures are different, and our innate sensitivity to magic is also different. Will your insights be effective if used on my body?”\n\nGalamandis snorted, saying, “What the hell do you know? Although I’m a dragon, I’ve lived for tens of thousands of years. I’m intimately familiar with your human structure. My experience in magic alone is something you can never compare to. Enough talk, pack up your good stuff. We’re getting ready to leave.” As he spoke, he pointed to the cooking utensils on the ground.\n\nFinally able to leave here, Nian Bing couldn’t help but be overjoyed, yet he remained calm on the surface. After cleaning the cooking utensils, he put them one by one into his spatial ring.\n\nGalamandis looked at the treasures, mused for a moment, then said, “Nian Bing, I suddenly noticed a problem. Your three knives represent fire, ice, and wind magic respectively. Among them, ice evolves from water. Haven’t you noticed that when you use these three different knives to cut food, even without using magic, the same dish will taste different?”\n\nNian Bing, while packing his things, said unceremoniously, “Nonsense, you don’t need to tell me that. Because each of my three knives is inlaid with a top-grade gem containing a magic element. When cutting ingredients, they naturally infuse magic elements into them. When eaten, the taste is naturally different. This is also the advantage of applying magic to food. Ordinary chefs, no matter how exquisite their skill, cannot make dishes possess a magical aura. It was precisely for this reason that my teacher was defeated by a common roasted meat dish back then.”\n\nGalamandis chuckled, saying, “If that’s the case, wouldn’t having knives of various attributes allow you to create even more different flavors?”\n\nNian Bing’s eyes lit up, but he quickly returned to calm. “You say that easily. Ordinary magic knives are useless. Only top-grade magic knives like mine can fully integrate magic elements into food. Do you have top-grade knives? I don’t believe it. What’s more, my magic can only use ice and fire forms, and I don’t have your mimicry ability. When cooking, only ice and fire elements can fully unleash their power. Other types of magic won’t work.”\n\nGalamandis looked at Nian Bing, chuckled, and said, “Kid, you don’t need to put on an act. I know you want to learn my magic mimicry and also have designs on my treasures.”\n\nNian Bing said, his expression unchanged, “Did I? You were the one who brought these up just now. What does that have to do with me? Didn’t you say you wanted to leave here? My things are already packed.”\n\nGalamandis leaned back comfortably among his treasures and lay down, saying, “Nian Bing, it’s not impossible for you to learn magic mimicry from me. If it were an ordinary human mage, they might not be able to do it. But you are different. Ice and fire magic are inherently completely opposite. If you can cultivate true ice and fire of the same origin, using that as a foundation, it won’t be inferior to our dragon race’s inherent advantages.”",

    "content": "Nianbing's heart stirred, and he said, \"You mean to say, based on Ice and Fire Coexistence, to perform mimicry of other elemental magics, right?\"\n\nGalamandis chuckled, and said, \"Theoretically, it's completely feasible. As for whether you can truly succeed, that depends on what level your Ice and Fire Coexistence magic can reach. There's no hurry for this, you can cultivate slowly. Ice and Fire Coexistence is not that easy to control; even I don't quite understand the principle of this magic. However, I'll give you a suggestion: you need to research more from the subtle details. For example, although a magic element is very small, a sparrow may be small, but it has all its organs*. If you can thoroughly research a single magic element, then you can discern many things from it. All magic elements have commonalities; even diametrically opposed ice and fire, light and darkness, are no exception. Where is the common ground between ice and fire? As long as you figure this out, everything in the future will be easier to achieve. Consider that two opposing forces, under certain circumstances, can transform into each other. This counts as your first lesson from me. I also know that these are quite profound, and might be difficult for you, a magic beginner, to understand, but you don't need to be discouraged, take it slowly. Of course, you don't need to thank me. Even if you learn magic mimicry, you'll still be far from catching up to my level. I'm not teaching you these with good intentions. Mastering more magic means you can make more varied dishes to satisfy me. We're just using each other.\"\n\nAlthough Nianbing didn't have much goodwill towards Galamandis, he highly recognized his understanding of magic. He completely committed Galamandis's words to his mind. Although he couldn't fully understand them for the moment, he knew these were the most useful things for his future cultivation. \"Who would thank you? You also said, we're just using each other. Anyway, if you find me displeasing, at most you'll kill me. With your abilities, dealing with a small fry like me would certainly be an instant kill. However, there probably aren't many on the continent who can integrate magic into cooking.\"\n\n\"You stinking brat, you dare to threaten the great Galamandis, do you really want to die?\" Galamandis suddenly sat up, flames shooting from his eyes. He glared at Nianbing with an angry face.\n\nNianbing smiled slightly. He said, \"Alright, stop pretending. You've lived for tens of thousands of years; if you truly got angry over a few words from me, you wouldn't be the great Galamandis anymore.\"\n\nGalamandis was stunned for a moment, then burst out laughing, \"Brat, aren't you buttering up a dragon*? However, it does sound quite comfortable. How about this, I can't just use you for nothing. What you said earlier also makes sense. If you can find other elemental magic knives of similar quality, it will greatly improve your magic and cooking skills. Mm. I won't use you for nothing; let me lend you something to use first.\" As he spoke, he reached into his pile of treasures with a backhand, and with a flick of his wrist, a golden light landed in his palm. It was a knife. It was an ordinary-looking knife, no different from the battle-knives used by regular knights. The blade was wide, the spine was thick, and it was about four feet long. The blade itself was a palm's width, and its thickest part near the spine was nearly an inch. This kind of thick-backed broadsword was undoubtedly most suitable for chopping. In its normal form, the battle-knife appeared extraordinary due to the golden luster it emitted, yet there were no decorations on this blade; everything was so natural, without even a single pattern. The hilt was smooth, lacking the delicate finger-grip indentations found on the Aotian Blade. The soft golden light emanating from the blade made this weapon, which should have been a fearsome battle-knife, exude a gentle aura.\n\nGalamandis reached out and lightly flicked the knife. The blade immediately emitted a pleasant and melodious hum. The golden light on the blade swayed, showing signs of piercing the air and ascending. It seemed to be so gentle only because of Galamandis's suppression. Glancing at Nianbing, Galamandis said, \"What do you think of this knife?\"\n\nNianbing nodded, praising, \"It is indeed a good knife. It's a battle-knife specifically for knights. If my guess is correct, the weight of this knife is extraordinary. What's most valuable is the light-element magic aura it carries. Generally, weapons like knives are very difficult to become light-element magic items, because light elements are the purest and most sacred in magic, incompatible with the killing intent of weapons. For this knife to gain the recognition of light magic elements and become a light-element magic knife, if I'm not mistaken, it was originally not a weapon for killing, but rather a sacrificial knife used by Light Priests, wasn't it?\"\n\nGalamandis burst into hearty laughter, \"Well said! To have such insights is quite good for a weak human like you. What a pity, what a pity, you didn't get a single thing right. Although this knife is surrounded by a vast amount of light elements and filled with a sacred aura, it is precisely a battle-knife for killing, not some sacrificial knife. Under this knife, tens of thousands of people have perished. However, it remains a holy knife, not a demonic knife. The reason it could be imbued with the sacred aura of light elements was not through light-element mages, but because the holy knife moved Heaven, and light elements automatically converged and formed around it. This knife is one of the most precious items in my entire collection. It has a few names, embodying purity from the heavens*; the most common one is 'Dawn'. Tens of thousands of years ago, it was the dawn for all the poor and persecuted. When Dawn arrived, all suffering would end. The name of this holy knife is 'Dawn'. It appeared in your human world for a total of seventy-three years. For seventy-three years, the holy knife Dawn was the nightmare of all nobles and villains, and the dawn for all who were persecuted. Under this knife, tens of thousands of evil people perished. Even the notorious 'Killing King' Ying Qi didn't slay as many. This knife not only slew humans, but also other races. Even among our Dragon race, a mutated three-headed evil dragon once died under this knife. However, although this Dawn knife slaughtered countless lives, it only killed those who were extremely evil and treacherous. Villains cursed it, but tens of thousands of times more commoners and oppressed races praised it. When the Dawn knife killed other beings, it only needed a flash of light from the blade; the blade itself never made contact with the enemy. That irresistible white light alone was the enemy's nightmare. Later, when Dawn had swept across the continent for sixty years, this white light changed, turning golden. That wasn't the divine battle aura you humans speak of, but rather the blade itself underwent a spontaneous baptism by light elements, becoming a Holy Light Knife. No one, including me, knows what material this knife is made of. However, ten thousand years have passed, and it shows no trace of rust. Sacred light elements eternally guard it, guarding this Dawn knife that once pierced through heaven and earth.\"\n\nNianbing sighed softly, and said, \"Events from ten thousand years ago are long gone from the continent's history, but hearing you speak, and looking at this knife, I can imagine the heroic bearing of that senior. He was born for justice. In this regard, I can never compare. My pursuit is merely revenge and the pinnacle of culinary art. Galamandis, can you tell me his story in detail? I'm very curious about this senior who swept across the continent for seventy-three years and dedicated everything to justice. Can one person truly be that righteous? Did he never do anything dark? I truly find it hard to believe that he could influence the entire continent with just his own strength.\"\n\nGalamandis snorted, and said, \"Idiot, when did I say he was one person? Whether he committed evil deeds can be seen from this knife; to be directly recognized by light elements already proves everything. Can you make light elements recognize anything of yours? Only a saint with an open mind, a bright heart, and who dedicates everything to helping others can do so. I rarely admire humans, but I cannot help but admire this person. On this Yangguang Continent, humans have produced several martial artists who reached the God-Master realm; they were already powerful enough to approach the strength of those 'gods'. However, the only one who truly went to the Divine Realm was the master of this Dawn. He was also, as far as I know, the only Saint-Master on the entire continent. A Saint-Master worshipped by all races at that time. He also led one of the few unifications of the Yangguang Continent, lasting the longest and being the most beloved by the people. At that time, the Yangguang Continent was completely a vast, free, and democratic nation. Humanity's cohesion was unprecedentedly high. What a pity, what a pity.\" Speaking of this, the human-shaped Galamandis's eyes surprisingly showed a somber expression. He gently shook his head, his hazy gaze fixed on the Dawn knife.\n\nNianbing's heart stirred, and he said, \"What's a pity? Did something happen later? Didn't you say this Saint-Master went to the Divine Realm? What's regrettable about such a perfect ending?\"\n\nGalamandis caressed the blade of Dawn, and said, \"Although the Saint-Master was admirable, he had no good descendants. His descendants became worse with each generation, and the perfectly grand nation was thus ruined. In the end, humanity was even almost wiped out. This forced the Saint-Master to risk punishment from the Divine Realm and return to the Yangguang Continent. He moved the Divine Race with the price of his endless life, only then completely sealing the enemies. They were sealed into the seven Mo'aodas Sealing Vials, entrusted to us Seven Great Dragon Kings for safekeeping, allowing the continent to regain peace. Although the prosperous scene was no more, at least humanity no longer faced the crisis of annihilation. This spirit of self-sacrifice and fearlessness is what I admire most. Unexpectedly, ten thousand years later, someone has finally come to plot for the Mo'aodas Sealing Vials.\"\n\nNianbing's whole body trembled slightly, and he said, \"The Mo'aodas Sealing Vials are actually so important, then you should quickly retrieve them!\"\n\n\"Search? Of course I'll search. But, there's no use rushing. That despicable fellow that day used a teleportation scroll and God knows where he teleported to. Even if I wanted to find it, I couldn't find it in a short time. Besides, it's almost impossible to completely obtain all seven sealing vials, which is why I'm not in a hurry. After we leave here, while eating your human delicacies, we'll search slowly.\"\n\nNianbing looked at Galamandis with a wry smile, and said, \"Your thoughts are truly peculiar. Choosing you to guard this sealing vial was definitely a mistake made by those gods. Can you tell me what exactly is sealed inside those vials? And what kind of enemy almost destroyed all of humanity back then? The dynasty established by the Saint-Master was so powerful, could it have been an invasion by other races?\"\n\nGalamandis snorted, and said, \"I've said it before, it's better for you to know less about these matters. Knowing too much will only endanger your life; I have no obligation to protect you. However, what I can tell you is that only humanity itself can destroy humanity. It has nothing to do with any other race. Just like a warrior's greatest obstacle in cultivation is their own inner demon. If you humans don't strive**, no one can help you. Alright. This Dawn knife will be yours from now on; it's your fourth cooking knife. The pure light elements on Dawn will surely make the food taste great. Hehe.\"\n\n\"What? You're giving Dawn to me to use for cooking?\" Although Nianbing was eager to obtain a light-element cooking knife, Dawn's origin was so miraculous, and it was the only item the Saint-Master left behind in the human world. To use it as a cooking knife was truly a bit... Of course, this wasn't the main reason. This Dawn was longer than Feng Nu's Litian Sword, and it was also wide and thick. How could such a large knife be used as a cooking knife? Whether he could even lift it was probably a question, which was why he asked Galamandis with such doubt.\n\nGalamandis lightly swung the Dawn in his hand, and said, \"No matter how powerful Dawn's origin is, it only truly becomes Dawn in the hands of the Saint-Master. Rather than leaving it in my pile of treasures, it's better to give it to you to use as a cooking knife. Using it as a cooking knife isn't doing anything evil, so there's no problem. However, this knife is not just 'not light'; if you want to master it, you'll need to put in more effort. Give me that light-element gemstone of yours. This holy knife has existed for over ten thousand years; it's time for it to be upgraded. After all, without the Saint-Master's mastery, it has robbed itself of its soul.\"\n\nThe Dawn knife plus the Sacred Radiance Stone, isn't that too formidable? Nianbing stared at Galamandis with wide eyes.\n\nGalamandis said impatiently, \"Hurry up. If you want to leave here sooner, quickly give me that stone. I know what you're worried about. Actually, don't you yourself know that the gemstones on your three existing knives were all left behind by those 'gods' in the human realm? Without your light-element gemstone added to the knife, how could Dawn compare to your other knives? As long as the gemstone is added, if you can acquire the ability to mimicry in the future, the Dawn knife will become a top-tier magic staff, a light-element magic staff, just like your three existing magic knives.\"\n\n---\n*   Literally \"a sparrow may be small, but it has all its organs,\" a Chinese idiom meaning something is small but complete or fully equipped.\n*   Literally \"buttering up a dragon,\" a variation of the Chinese idiom 拍馬屁 (pāimǎpì, \"patting a horse's arse\"), meaning to flatter someone.\n*   Literally \"it has a few incorruptibilities/purities coming from the heavens.\" This phrase is unusual in standard Chinese and is used here to describe the knife's celestial origin or essence.\n**  Literally \"don't rush your qi/energy,\" a Chinese idiom implying a lack of ambition, drive, or internal effort.",

    "content": "\"Kid, you just cook for me properly. There are plenty of benefits; as long as you satisfy my stomach, everything else is negotiable. Who knows, if you work hard for a hundred or eighty years, you might even have a chance to become another Saint Master.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"Don't try to fool me. I certainly don't want to be a Saint Master. I don't have that good a disposition, nor that great an ambition. Can I *not* cook for you? I still don't want to die.\" As he spoke, he took out the Sacred Radiance Stone from his Spatial Ring and handed it over. Taking the Sacred Radiance Stone, Galamandis's eyes revealed a dazed light. He looked at the overhead light and said, \"Nian Bing, kid, don't forget, I am the great Galamandis, and is there anything the great Galamandis doesn't understand? You are a chef; the quality of your mood greatly affects your cooking. It's not that I haven't eaten your human food before. If your creations weren't unrivaled, do you think I would waste so much effort on you? Trying to play tricks on the great Galamandis will do you no good.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart lurched, and just as he was about to say something, he felt his whole body shake. His body was enveloped by a scorching current of air and sent to the edge of the cavern. The next moment, Galamandis, holding a blade in one hand and clutching the Sacred Radiance Stone in the other, began to chant softly. Strange intonations, like a low hum, continuously diffused outwards. Though not loud, the sound caused the entire cavern to tremble slightly. As Galamandis chanted the spell, his hands turned a ruby-like red, and his crystalline, transparent hands continuously injected red currents of air into the Sacred Radiance Stone and the Dawn Holy Blade.\n\nBack then, Feng Nü needed to expend a great deal of battle qi even with Hua Tian's smelting furnace to fuse the Sun-Correcting Blade with the Flame God's Stone. Yet everything before him was so effortless for Galamandis. When the golden-glowing Dawn Holy Blade and the Sacred Radiance Stone both turned the same color as his hands, the blade and the gem naturally fused together. The Sacred Radiance Stone, embedded in the long, sturdy hilt, looked completely harmonious, as if it had always belonged there.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was marveling at Galamandis's power, Galamandis suddenly shrieked, letting go of the Dawn Blade and flinging it away. The blade transformed into a red light, appearing before Nian Bing in the blink of an eye, giving him no time to react. The touch magic scrolls on his person unleashed brilliant colors one after another. A total of four protective scrolls exploded almost simultaneously, but their explosions failed to block the ruby-like light. That was the power of penetration, a penetration that magic attached to scrolls could not withstand.\n\nNot even his position changed due to the magic scrolls' resistance. An intense burning sensation spread throughout his body. The blade pierced through his chest, and Nian Bing clearly heard the sound of his breastbone shattering. The smell of scorched flesh was so foul. At the same time, his life force rapidly drained away, even though he was pierced in the right side of his chest. But the Dawn Blade was simply too heavy. Under Galamandis's mighty exertion, Nian Bing's body was lifted as lightly as a straw man, and pinned to the cave wall along with the blade.\n\nHaving suddenly suffered such a severe injury, Nian Bing felt no pain. Due to the blade's intense heat, the wound instantly coagulated; not even a drop of blood flowed out. His mind went blank. *Why did he want to kill me? Am I really going to die like this? Everything ending like this, just as there was hope of leaving this place, but instead, it took my life.*\n\nWith a flash of red light, Galamandis appeared before Nian Bing. He smiled strangely, continuously muttering incantations, one hand already gripping the hilt now embedded with the Sacred Radiance Stone. The tranquil sound of the magic incantation enveloped Nian Bing's body like ripples of water. He suddenly felt a warmth surge through his entire body. A warm current of air emanated from the Dawn Holy Blade, which had been continuously draining his life force. The wound, which had just transitioned from numbness to searing pain, became comfortable under the influence of this warm current. The pain rapidly disappeared, and amidst flickering light, his life force stopped draining and began to recover minute by minute.\n\nGalamandis suddenly let out a low cry, and the Dawn Holy Blade was instantly pulled from Nian Bing's chest. Covered by a golden glow, no blood spurted out either. His expression suddenly became serious. With his left palm and right blade, as he continuously chanted strange incantations, he emitted both golden and blue lights. The light and water elements simultaneously addressed Nian Bing's wounds. Light and water each had their unique characteristics in healing, and when fused together at this moment, they fully demonstrated their powerful healing abilities. Nian Bing's injuries miraculously healed, leaving no trace. Not even the circulation of qi and blood within his body, nor his magic vortex, were affected in the slightest. When the magic left his body and he slowly slid to the ground, he couldn't help but feel reborn. From life to death, then from death to life—such a feeling greatly stimulated Nian Bing's nerves.\n\nStruggling to his feet and moving his body, Nian Bing said, a mix of shock and anger in his voice: \"Galamandis, are you mad? Although my life is in your hands, if you're going to play with me like this, you might as well just kill me.\" He made no attempt to fight Galamandis to the death, knowing it would be futile. He gazed coldly at Galamandis, his eyes filled with chill.\n\nGalamandis snorted and said, \"What's so fun about you? Would I stoop to playing with you? Idiot, do you think just anyone can use this Dawn Divine Blade? Just now, when I forcibly fused your gem with it, I was met with a powerful backlash from the Dawn Blade itself. Fortunately, this gem is the purest Light Element Divine Stone, which allowed the fusion to succeed. But after the fusion, it needed some soul aura for a baptism. The Dawn Blade's original owner was human, and I am a dragon, so of course, your blood was needed. You kid actually used touch magic scrolls, almost ruining my grand plan. Luckily, the power I used was sufficient. Now, your bloodline has been acknowledged by the Dawn Blade, and this blade is yours from now on. As for whether you can make it still brilliantly emit its ancient radiance, that's up to you.\"\n\nLooking at the Dawn Blade Galamandis offered him, Nian Bing skeptically took the hilt. The moment Galamandis let go, Nian Bing felt his whole body sink. Because his mind was still caught up in the previous ordeal of the blade piercing his chest, his entire body toppled forward with the blade. With a *thud*, half the Dawn Blade's edge plunged into the ground, only then stabilizing his posture.\n\nGalamandis said gloatingly: \"Kid, it'll be anything but easy if you want to use the Dawn Blade as your kitchen knife. Enjoy it slowly yourself. Don't worry, you won't have any after-effects. With my ninth-tier Light and Water magic, unless your head explodes, you won't be able to die even if you want to.\" Looking at Nian Bing with an evil gaze, he had already devised a way to torment Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing looked at the long blade before him. Although he hadn't been focused just now, he had trained his blade techniques for years, and his arms were much stronger than ordinary people's. Yet, he couldn't hold onto this Dawn Blade. Evidently, the Dawn Blade's weight was far greater than it appeared. Gripping the hilt with both hands, he exerted all his strength to pull the Dawn Blade up, barely holding it horizontally in front of him. Nian Bing was astonished to discover that the Dawn Blade likely weighed over a hundred *jin*[^1]. Even with both hands, he couldn't possibly wield this heavy holy blade. He couldn't help but smile bitterly and say, \"Great Galamandis, if you want to harm me, just say so. There's no need to beat around the bush, is there? This blade is useless to me, utterly worthless.\" The golden blade light was completely contained. It looked less brilliant than before, yet Nian Bing vaguely felt that this holy blade seemed to have transcended the sensation of metal, as if it were composed of light elements. That pure sensation, combined with the vast holy aura, calmed his previously startled mind. The Heaven's Splendor Medallion on his chest emitted even more tranquil aura, shimmering in concert with the Dawn Holy Blade, creating an exceptionally comfortable feeling. The warmth brought by the light swept away the negative emotions in his heart. Everything returned to nature, and Nian Bing's gaze became much more peaceful.\n\nGalamandis said impatiently, \"You call such a treasured blade useless? You truly don't know a good thing when you see it. Let me tell you, this blade weighs a full one hundred and twenty-eight *jin*. That's twice the weight of a typical sixty-four *jin* greatsword. It's a heavy weapon. And after getting your gem, this blade's light element aura is extremely potent. If you encounter any dark creatures, or enemies like that scoundrel who stole Mu'aodas's sealed bottle that day, with this Dawn Holy Blade protecting you, dark negative energy won't be able to harm your body. Such a good item, originally a priceless treasure, and you still don't want it?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"I know it's a good thing, but don't forget, I'm a magician, not a warrior. Even among warriors, there probably aren't many who can wield a one-hundred-and-twenty-eight *jin* heavy blade, are there?\" *Would carrying this thing around be comfortable?* Although he felt he didn't really deserve the Sacred Radiance Stone, his rational mind knew even better that this blade wasn't of much use to him.\n\nGalamandis chuckled and said, \"I'm doing this for your own good! You human magicians often prioritize cultivating magical power and spiritual power, but you don't realize you've entered a misconception. Everything has limits, and so does the human body. Simply cultivating magical and spiritual power means physical training for magicians will inevitably be reduced to the minimum. You're still somewhat better off; as a chef, you still move around. Ordinary magicians' bodies are much weaker than yours. Because they simply don't understand that the body is the source of everything. When magical and spiritual power become strong to a certain extent, it becomes an enormous burden on the body itself. This burden then restricts your magical development. To give a simple example: human Archmagi among you would never easily use Forbidden Spell-level magic, which are eleventh-tier spells. They clearly possess that power, so why don't they dare to use it casually? If you ask, they'll surely tell you it's because they fear magical backlash and other such nonsense – that's all bullcrap. The magic they use is cast by communicating with the magic elements between heaven and earth. Apart from sacrificial magic in dark magic, which involves sacrificing something of oneself for general use, there's no such thing as backlash for ordinary magic. The backlash those Archmagi speak of is merely a resonance between forbidden spells and the magic elements in the world.\"\n\n\"Resonance with magic elements?\" Nian Bing looked at Galamandis in surprise. Since getting to know the great Galamandis, Nian Bing had realized that he was continuously coming into contact with new magical domains.\n\nGalamandis chuckled and said, \"Exactly, it's resonance with magic. At that time, the magic elements will produce strong vibrations. After all, it's an eleventh-tier spell, and the vibrations reach a certain intensity. And Archmagi are old magicians who have cultivated for many years. With their frail, aging bodies, how could they withstand such resonance? It would undoubtedly lead to their demise, which is why they dare not use them. Conversely, think about this: if your body is robust, the resonance will cause much less harm to you when using magic, or even no harm at all. That way, not only can you use higher-tier magic, but it can also make the cultivation of magical power easier to break through bottlenecks. Don't you want to learn more magical knowledge from me? What I'm teaching you today is all from my own experience. Therefore, as long as you carry this Dawn Blade and diligently train your body, your magical future will be limitless. Since you can create touch magic scrolls, it seems you still have potential.\"\n\nNian Bing thought carefully, vaguely feeling that Galamandis's words made a lot of sense, but his flickering eyes always made him uneasy. He looked at the Dawn Blade in his hand. He really couldn't bear to return it to Galamandis; after all, it was a magical blade comparable to Morning Dew, Sun-Correcting, and Arrogant Heaven! At once, he nodded and said, \"Since this blade is already mine, I want to give it a new name. I don't wish to be a saint, so this heavy blade shall be named after my gem: the Sacred Radiance Blade. To commemorate that senior, I shall call it 'Dawn that Pierces Heaven and Earth'.\"\n\nGalamandis, hands clasped behind his back, nodded in satisfaction and said, \"Dawn that Pierces Heaven and Earth—Sacred Radiance Blade. Good, it's a fine name. It shall be as you say. Alright, it's time for us to leave. Nian Bing, I'll help you properly train your body. I'll hold onto your ring for you for now. You carry the Sacred Radiance Blade yourself and walk out of the mountain range. I imagine that once you're out of the Heaven-Shaking Mountain Range, your body will definitely reach a new realm. You've cooked for me for a few days, so rest assured, I'll provide you with food along the way. Go up now.\" With a flash, before Nian Bing could understand what was happening, the Spatial Ring on his hand had already vanished. Immediately after, Nian Bing felt his body soar high as if riding the clouds, charging directly towards the top of the cave with the Sacred Radiance Blade.\n\n---\n[^1]: A *jin* (斤) is a traditional Chinese unit of weight, typically equivalent to 500 grams or 1.1 pounds.",

    "content": "Galamandis smiled sinisterly, muttering to himself, \"Nianbing, kid, aren't you easily tired from cooking? This time I'll help you train your body properly, so you won't be lazy and not cook for me later. A mage training their body, hmm, a good choice. However, what I said is also true, not deceiving you. Wahahaha, the great Galamandis is truly clever! My delicacies! I'm coming!\" With a wave of his hand among the piles of treasures, light flickered. Just as the thrown Nianbing had risen a hundred zhang, he only felt his whole body tighten, and his body was already held above Galamandis's head. Before he could figure out what was happening, the two had already appeared outside the cave. Instantly, fresh air rushed towards him. Nianbing propped himself up with his blade, his vision suddenly cleared. Finally, he didn't have to suffer the torment of being like a frog in a well^1 in the cave.\n\nGalamandis played with the Space Ring in his hand, chuckled and said, \"We can go now. Don't worry, for the next few days you just need to focus on traveling, you don't need to cook for me.\"\n\nNianbing looked at the vast mountains, smiled wryly and said, \"Do I really have to carry this blade and walk by myself? Great Galamandis, are you sure this method is beneficial for magic cultivation?\"\n\nGalamandis put on a serious expression. \"Of course, the great Galamandis never lies.\"\n\nNianbing hesitated for a moment and said, \"Then if what you say is true, aren't warriors more suitable for cultivating magic? But human magic warriors are very rare!\"\n\nGalamandis snorted and said, \"What the hell do you know? Warriors cultivate fighting qi^2. While fighting qi and magic have some common origins, their cultivation methods and the effects they display are ultimately different. One is internal cultivation, the other is external connection. If one cultivates fighting qi, their perception of magic elements in the air will change significantly. Even if they force dual cultivation, it won't have good results. Of course, powerful beings like our Dragon Race are absolute exceptions. You humans can't achieve that. So, I only told you to train your body, I didn't say to cultivate martial arts.\"\n\nLooking at the heavy Holy Splendor Blade in his hand, Nianbing's face was bitter. Carrying something over a hundred jin^3 while traversing mountains is not an easy task! Galamandis kept a stern face. With his right hand, he lightly waved towards a large tree on the mountaintop. Instantly, a tough branch broke off. He made a grabbing motion with his right hand, and the branch fell into his palm. He flicked the branch, and it made cracking sounds in the air. \"Kid, learning magic from me isn't that easy. I will teach you well, don't even think about being lazy, otherwise, this branch of mine won't be merciful.\" As he spoke, he made to whip him.\n\n\"No, great Galamandis, can't I just walk?\" Nianbing could only helplessly tell himself that this was all for magic cultivation. He reluctantly lifted the Holy Splendor Blade, and advanced along the rugged and difficult mountain path in the direction Galamandis pointed. One hundred twenty-eight jin; lifting it suddenly might not be much, but traveling with such a heavy weight on his back was no ordinary feat.\n\nThe Fire Dragon Clan^4 might have been notified by Galamandis, as they did not appear again. As he continuously moved forward, Nianbing realized that the branch in Galamandis's hand wasn't merely for urging him onward, it also became his lifeline. The mountain path was steep, and carrying the Holy Splendor Blade, weighing a hundred twenty-eight jin, Nianbing stumbled more than once due to insufficient strength. And then, that flexible branch would naturally coil around his body, pulling him back from the brink of danger. Galamandis followed behind him as if strolling leisurely. After being rescued several times, Nianbing suddenly felt that he didn't dislike Galamandis as much anymore, and believed some of what he had said earlier. His physical strength was greatly overdrawn, his coarse cloth clothes had already turned into strips. Nianbing no longer cared about any of that.\n\nAn hour after leaving the mountaintop, Galamandis finally said to Nianbing, who was slowly inching forward, \"Alright, it's been an hour. Rest for a while.\"\n\nAs soon as he heard that, Nianbing's first action was to slide to the ground. He didn't care that the Holy Splendor Blade had fallen beside him, lying on the ground, gasping for breath.\n\n\"Crack.\" Amidst the crisp crack^5, Nianbing, lying on the ground, jolted all over and sat up in intense pain. He angrily said, \"Are you trying to kill me?! Didn't you say to rest for a while?\"\n\nGalamandis squatted beside Nianbing, chuckled, took out a black, muddled thing the size of a child's fist from his embrace and shoved it into Nianbing's mouth. Nianbing only felt a putrid stench assault his nostrils. He was just about to spit it out, when a scorching current flowed through his entire body. Subconsciously, he opened his mouth, Galamandis patted his upper body, and instantly, that black, muddled lump slid down his throat, bringing with it a wave of scorching heat.\n\nNianbing looked at Galamandis in surprise. \"What did you make me eat?\" His chest and abdomen churned, waves of nausea swept over him, but under the effect of Galamandis's ability, he couldn't vomit it out no matter what.\n\nGalamandis said leisurely, \"Of course it's poison. Do you think I'd give you something good?\" As he spoke, he removed the energy he had applied to Nianbing. The thing had already been digested.\n\n\"*\"^6 Nianbing extended his middle finger towards Galamandis. Anyway, he knew Galamandis couldn't bear to kill him. \"Poison then, fine. Anyway, with you around, I'll be played to death sooner or later, so it's better to be poisoned to death. Even if I'm going to die, I want to sleep for a bit first.\" As he spoke, he lay down on the ground again. Just as he was about to relax, intense pain came again.\n\n\"Ouch,\" Nianbing flipped over and sat up, looking at the branch Galamandis had just withdrawn from his hand. Fire nearly shot from his eyes. \"Why are you hitting me again? Didn't I just eat the poison?\"\n\nGalamandis said slowly, \"If you want to improve your magic, now is the best time. The more exhausted your body, the easier it is for your mind to concentrate. Do you remember what I said earlier? To perceive the mysteries of magic from the smallest details. If you dare lie down again, it won't be just one whip.\" A hint of an evil smile hung at the corner of his mouth, and the branch in his hand continuously made cracking sounds in the air.\n\nHearing Galamandis's words, Nianbing finally understood that he was guiding him. His mind instantly cleared as if enlightened^7. He looked deeply at Galamandis, then sat cross-legged, steadying his exhausted body, trying his best to forget his physical fatigue. He concentrated his mind entirely on his magic power, just as Galamandis had said before, slowly absorbing magic elements from the air while using his spiritual power to observe these minute magic elements, sensing their mysteries within. Just as he was about to enter a meditative state, Nianbing's heart stirred, and he suddenly had an idea...\n\nGalamandis lazily leaned to the side, watching Nianbing. He thought to himself, 'This kid has some talent, and he doesn't seem that stupid. Practice hard. With Ice and Fire Twin Source^8 as the foundation, maybe after some time, he might truly grasp the ability of mimetic states. In that case, I won't have to worry about not having a wide variety of dishes to eat. Hmm, seven elemental magics, combined with various cooking methods for dishes, it'll be hard to eat the same thing twice. Haha.' Thinking of his triumph, Galamandis couldn't help but smile. He looked at Nianbing as if looking at a huge pile of wonderful food.\n\nJust then, faint red and blue currents of air rose around Nianbing's body, who was sitting cross-legged. The two currents slowly rotated around his body. Although the magic elements they carried were not strong, the rotating form was exactly the same as the Ice and Fire Twin Source within his body. The rotation speed was extremely fast. Galamandis initially paid it no mind. Suddenly, he noticed that the currents rotating around Nianbing's body were spinning slower and slower. Just as he was about to remind Nianbing, the two rotating magical forces abruptly stopped, forming dazzling red and blue light orbs on either side of Nianbing's body.\n\n\"Damn it, this kid's gone mad.\" Galamandis flashed forward to Nianbing, raising both hands simultaneously. The red light split into two streams, controlling the stagnant magical forces on either side of Nianbing's body. He truly didn't understand what Nianbing was trying to do. Why would the magic power that was rotating perfectly fine stop? One must know, to him, this was completely equivalent to suicide! By sensing the magic power within Nianbing, Galamandis clearly realized that this situation was absolutely not caused by cultivation deviation^9 during meditation, but was intentionally done by Nianbing himself. He deliberately wants to die? No, that's impossible! Galamandis immediately dismissed this thought, continuing to carefully control the two entirely opposite magical forces within Nianbing. He didn't believe Nianbing would choose suicide. However, at this point, even someone as powerful as him had no way to resolve the current predicament. Galamandis knew that as soon as the energy he was using to help Nianbing left, the ice and fire within his body would violently collide. At that time, Nianbing's body would surely be obliterated^10. Let alone his ninth-tier light and water recovery magic based on mimetic forms, even a twelfth-tier super forbidden spell couldn't reshape a destroyed body. For the sake of delicacies, he could only control Nianbing's body. His dragon mind continuously worked, pondering all possible methods.\n\nTime passed second by second. Galamandis had been thinking for nearly two hours. For him, continuously controlling the energy within Nianbing's body consumed little. But waiting idly like this, he grew increasingly impatient. After two hours, he had envisioned countless possibilities. However, although he was the Fire Dragon King, he didn't know much about the Ice and Fire Twin Source magic appearing in humans. He had thought about trying to restore the rotation of Nianbing's magic power within him, but he had no certainty whatsoever about what would happen if the two completely opposite magical forces came into contact. Galamandis truly couldn't bear to let Nianbing die like this. Although they had only known each other for a few days, Nianbing's culinary skill made him extremely satisfied. It wasn't easy to find such a dedicated chef who delivered himself to his doorstep! Therefore, although Galamandis was vexed, he had no intention of giving up on Nianbing at this moment. As he controlled the two streams of energy within Nianbing, he noticed that Nianbing's spiritual power seemed to have given up control over his own magic power, but was entirely concentrated in his brain, thinking about something unknown. Perhaps he was also thinking of a way out of this predicament.\n\nWhat was Nianbing doing? Of course, he had no reason to commit suicide. The reason he stopped the rotation of the Ice and Fire Twin Source and forced himself into a desperate situation, naturally had its own reasons. Years of magic cultivation, the Ice and Fire Twin Source had always accompanied his growth. However, he also deeply knew that this was not the true Ice and Fire Twin Source. The ice and fire magic elements merely maintained a balance under a mysterious circumstance. During his own use, although he had come to understand some characteristics of the Ice and Fire Twin Source, he ultimately couldn't make the hidden danger between ice and fire disappear. How to solve this problem was what Nianbing thought about most during his usual cultivation. Through the guidance of Long Zhi and Hei Ye, and his own insights from reviewing various magic documents, he already had some theoretically viable methods. Coupled with Galamandis's enlightenment on magic these past few days, Nianbing further affirmed his understanding. This kind of cultivation was undoubtedly very dangerous. But at this moment, with a Dragon King protecting him, it was naturally the best opportunity. Nianbing was betting that Galamandis wouldn't bear to let him die. He was extremely confident about this point. That's why, after cultivation began, he directly split the ice and fire using his powerful spiritual power.\n\nDid Nianbing really expel all his magic power? Of course not. Although he gave up control of most of his magic power, however, he still left one fire element and one ice element at the spiritual imprint on his brow. Previously, when researching how to solve the Ice and Fire Twin Source problem, how to implement it was once his biggest obstacle in thought. But Galamandis's phrase \"start small, sense from a single element\" made Nianbing's idea suddenly clear. He now concentrated his spiritual power entirely in his mind, wholeheartedly sensing the similarities and differences between these two magic elements, ice and fire.\n\nMore than three hours had passed since he began cultivating until now. They had left the cave at noon. And as Nianbing continuously sensed, his understanding of the ice and fire magic elements grew stronger and stronger. This situation was very difficult to achieve. One must know, normally during cultivation, thousands of magic elements are absorbed and released. Magic elements are always in motion. Even if he wanted to, it would be impossible to isolate just one magic element for observation. And now, by abandoning his original magic power, he was able to enter this state. It was a mysterious feeling. With deep understanding, Nianbing began to transform the ice and fire elements.\n\nHe realized that, in fact, both ice and fire elements were pure elements, only their inherent properties were different. Relatively speaking, ice elements were stable magic elements, while fire elements were much more active, constantly in agitation.\n\n---\n^1 Literally \"sitting in a well, looking at the sky,\" meaning to have a limited outlook or be ignorant of the larger world.\n^2 A concept in fantasy literature, referring to a form of internal energy cultivated by warriors for combat.\n^3 A traditional Chinese unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kilograms or 1.1 pounds.\n^4 Literally \"Fire Dragon Human Race,\" implying a race that is part fire dragon, part human.\n^5 Literally \"suffer a loss\" or \"be at a disadvantage.\" Here, it describes the sharp sound of the whip or the immediate painful consequence experienced.\n^6 The original text uses an asterisk here.\n^7 Literally \"pouring enlightened butter (ghee) on the head,\" meaning to awaken or enlighten one suddenly.\n^8 Literally \"Ice and Fire, same source,\" a common concept in fantasy implying two opposing elements originating from the same source or existing in harmony within one being.\n^9 Literally \"fire-deviation and demon-possession,\" a term in cultivation novels meaning to suffer severe mental or physical damage from incorrect meditation or cultivation practices.\n^10 Literally \"turn to ashes and smoke,\" meaning to be utterly destroyed or obliterated.",

    "title": "Chapter 68: The evolution of the same origin of ice and fire (Part 2)",
    "content": "Stable ice elements are more conducive to control, equally suitable for offense and defense. Moreover, they can transform into water, simultaneously possessing water's aura of life. This aura of life is a shared characteristic of both water and ice, much like light elements possess a sacred aura.\n\nOn the other hand, active fire elements, due to their volatile nature, are more suitable for attack. Among various magical elements, they are the most unstable, with the strongest energy fluctuations. The chill of ice and the heat of fire, due to their opposing characteristics, will either repel or counteract each other upon encountering. If they share any common trait, it is their origin. Not just ice and fire, but the foundation of any magical element lies in the word 'element.' Whether it's an ice element or a fire element, in Nian Bing's mind, they are all a single point, an extremely minute speck of light, only perceptible through mental power. Although their attributes differ, their translated energy magnitude is completely identical; the same applies to other magical elements. Thinking of this, Nian Bing's understanding of magic suddenly deepened to a certain extent.\n\nThe fundamental energy magnitude of any magical element is the same, but due to the differing characteristics of the seven basic magical elements, when using magic, as the quantity of magical elements drawn upon increases, the characteristics of various magics will become more clearly manifested. Coupled with the mutual generation and mutual overcoming of the seven magic systems, only then can so many rich and diverse magics evolve. The power of magic is related to the purity and quantity of magical elements.\n\nSo-called purity refers to the more magical elements condensed within a certain volume, the higher the magic's purity. And the quantity of magic is a manifestation of how much magical power there is. Simply put, for a fireball composed of magical elements, the smaller its volume, the greater its power. The so-called compressing the volume of magic is to enhance the magic's intensity, and mental power is the most important factor affecting magic's purity.\n\nThe higher the tier of magic, the larger the difference between various systems due to the magic's immense scale. However, currently, at the mental imprint on Nian Bing's brow, there is only one ice and one fire magical element each. At this moment, their difference is the smallest.\n\nIf the ice elements were made active, and the fire elements more stable, allowing the two elements to reach a subtle balance, perhaps they would no longer repel each other so much. This balance is what he now seeks.\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing was greatly invigorated. He realized that the reason his Ice-Fire Homologization¹ could coexist peacefully during rotation was precisely because, during the rotation process, the activeness and volatility of the fire elements were suppressed, while the ice elements became active due to the rotation. This allowed them to coexist peacefully without infringing upon each other. If rotation could achieve such a balance, could artificial mental power control also bring them to this state? If so, then he would have nothing more to worry about in the future. Having understood this point, Nian Bing's Ice-Fire Homologization had unconsciously entered its second stage. Although there was still some distance from complete homologization where two opposing magics could mutually transform, having understood this point, the crisis of Ice-Fire Homologization also disappeared. Next, what he had to do was experiment, using these two single magical elements to find that point of balance. With mental power control, suppressing the activeness of magical elements and making stable magical elements active was not difficult. At this moment, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel grateful to his first master, Cha Ji. If it weren't for Cha Ji's urging, which greatly boosted his mental power during his culinary training, enabling his mental power to far surpass that of mages of the same rank, how could he perfectly control Ice-Fire Homologization?\n\nLate at night, the Tiandang Mountain Range² grew much quieter. The birds and beasts active during the day had already returned to their nests. The reason the center of the Tiandang Mountain Range could remain spring-like all year round was naturally due to the influence of Galamandis, the Fire Dragon King. The great mountain where he had resided for thousands of years had long been infected by his fire elements, becoming a true mountain of fire elements. In one hour, Nian Bing hadn't traveled far. At this resting place, the surrounding temperature was suitable, and as the night wind blew, it brought the moist air of morning dew. Although Galamandis was currently in human form, the faint dragon aura emanating from him made any creature dare not approach. He was very depressed. For more than half a day, Nian Bing's state remained unchanged. He didn't want to give up on Nian Bing. After long consideration, he decided to try rotation. However, this required Nian Bing's mental power cooperation; otherwise, even if the ice and fire magical elements began to rotate, without Nian Bing's reception, everything would still be in vain. But Nian Bing was now like he was asleep, his mental power completely concentrated in his brain, showing no signs of overflowing. This made Galamandis increasingly agitated, wishing he could give Nian Bing a good beating to vent his frustration.\n\nJust as Galamandis was about to risk triggering Nian Bing's mental power, Nian Bing's mental power finally reacted, and the reaction was very stable. His mental power split into two strands, flowing out from his mind and separately entering the static ice and fire magical elements, seemingly trying to draw out some of these two magical elements. Galamandis perceived Nian Bing's greed and subconsciously cooperated by releasing some ice and fire magical elements. A strange scene unfolded: the two magical elements did not begin to rotate as Galamandis had imagined, to bring along other magical elements. Instead, under Nian Bing's control, they converged towards his chest. A gentle white light emerged from Nian Bing's chest; that was the aura of the Sky Splendor Card³. He chose to complete the second stage fusion of Ice-Fire Homologization at his chest precisely because the Sky Splendor Card could stabilize the magic's restlessness. The two strands of mental power, under Nian Bing's skillful control, performed different tasks: fire became much quieter, while ice became active. When they reached a perfect balance point, the two magical elements embraced each other, completely merging. This stable state greatly astonished Galamandis. A rotation, then, gradually appeared, but the speed of rotation was extremely slow. The ice and fire magical elements slowly exchanged positions, flowing naturally, as if they were a pair of close brothers, intimate with each other, without a trace of repulsion.\n\nTime passed by minute by minute. Nian Bing, relying on his mental power, little by little mobilized his original ice and fire magical elements to undergo the fusion process. As the quantity of fused elements increased, and the fusion effect became more perfected, Galamandis finally understood that this seemingly weak human before him was growing towards strength. He never imagined that Nian Bing could make such a great breakthrough in such a short time. He couldn't help but secretly tell himself to continuously output the magical elements he controlled, cooperating with Nian Bing's cultivation. Of course, he couldn't have known that today's fusion was the result of Nian Bing's years of diligent research, and only someone with his innate ice-fire constitution, coupled with his familiarity with both ice and fire magical elements, could complete this second stage of fusion.\n\nWhen Nian Bing awoke from his state, it was already the dawn of the next day. His striped clothes were mixed with sweat, emitting an unpleasant odor. However, the moment he opened both eyes, the whole world seemed to change. Everything was so clear; he could even see the纹理 (texture/veins) on distant leaves and perceive the changes in birds' feathers as they groomed themselves. Everything was so wonderful. As long as he deliberately paid attention, the amount of various magical elements in the air would clearly appear before him. At his chest, a gentle energy sphere was slowly rotating. It was completely liquid, red and blue appearing so calm, without mutual conflict or repulsion. Such comfort was simply indescribable⁴. Feeling the capacity of his magical power, Nian Bing was surprised to find that after one night, his magical power had actually made great progress, just a hair's breadth away from entering the Archmage⁵ realm. And the characteristics of ice and fire were deeply imprinted in his mind, so incredibly clear.\n\n\"Brat, speak. How will you compensate me for my mental distress?\" Galamandis's sarcastic voice sounded. Nian Bing turned around to look, only to see him leaning against a nearby rock, watching him.\n\nSmiling awkwardly, Nian Bing said, \"Great Galamandis, I didn't expect this rest to last so long either. You wouldn't blame me for such a small matter, would you?\"\n\nGalamandis chuckled, \"A small matter? I don't think so. In tens of thousands of years of living, this is the first human I've seen who dared to use me. Don't tell me your actions yesterday weren't intentional. Do you think I'll believe that?\" After all, he was a dragon who had existed for tens of thousands of years. When Nian Bing's Ice-Fire Homologization fully entered its second stage, he instantly understood he had been tricked.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, the awkwardness on his face disappearing. He said matter-of-factly, \"You can't blame me for this either! Think about it, if I'm traveling on the continent with you in the future, and my magic level is too poor, wouldn't that be an embarrassment to you? What's more, you said that as long as my head doesn't explode, I won't die no matter what. I also want to master mimicry skills as soon as possible, that way, I can make you more delicious food.\"\n\nThese words hit home for Galamandis. Galamandis was naturally arrogant, and Nian Bing's subtle flattery⁶, combined with the allure of delicious food, instantly lessened the anger in his heart. He casually picked up yesterday's branch, pointed to the Saintly Radiance Blade⁷ on the ground, and said, \"Carry that, and let's continue on our way. Yesterday you still had the energy to use me; clearly, you weren't tired enough. Today we'll walk for two hours before we can rest for a while. Each rest cannot exceed one hour. If you dare to use me again, I'll directly detonate the magical power within you.\" After speaking, he walked directly into the distance.\n\nNian Bing secretly breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that Galamandis had accepted his unspoken loss⁸. Two hours it was then. He was in a very good mood now; his Ice-Fire Homologization had made a qualitative leap. Even if his magical power hadn't fundamentally increased, his Ice-Fire Homologization magic was no longer at its previous level. He gripped the Saintly Radiance Blade with both hands, hoisted it onto his shoulder, and strode out, following Galamandis towards the outside of the mountain range.\n\nAs he walked, Nian Bing discovered two issues. The most direct was that the Saintly Radiance Blade seemed less heavy than yesterday. Although it still weighed heavily on him, its overall weight felt much lighter. The other was that he wasn't hungry at all. One should know that due to yesterday's cultivation, he hadn't eaten for a full day; magical elements certainly couldn't be eaten as food.\n\nNian Bing was a clever person. Connecting these two puzzling points, he quickly searched his brain and soon thought of the 'poison' Galamandis had given him to eat yesterday. Although he had long guessed it wasn't real poison, he hadn't expected such an effect. Could it be that he had been medicated? Nian Bing secretly rejoiced, and the gaze in his eyes as he looked at Galamandis's back softened considerably.\n\nNian Bing's lighthearted mood didn't last long. Although his body was no worse than an ordinary person's, this rugged and difficult mountain path was not something an ordinary person could traverse, let alone with a heavy fellow weighing over a hundred jin⁹ on his shoulder. Perhaps Galamandis was still holding a grudge about yesterday's utilization; this time, Nian Bing fell several times, but Galamandis offered no rescue. Only once, when Nian Bing almost fell into a mountain stream, did he use that flexible branch to pull Nian Bing back. His magic had improved, and Nian Bing had also thought of using magic to carry this heavy blade, but he only tried once before dismissing the idea, because he gained ten red welts from the branch on his body. Fortunately, Galamandis did not object to him using his ice-to-water magic to heal himself; otherwise, Nian Bing would already be covered in wounds. Recalling the easy scene of riding in a sedan chair¹⁰ on the way here, Nian Bing's heart constricted. The good days were over; now, all he could rely on were his own two legs.\n\nTwo hours passed. Nian Bing collapsed onto the ground, exhausted like a dead dog. Before the branch could whip his body, he hurriedly sat up. Before he entered a meditative state, another foul-smelling thing was stuffed into his mouth. Since he had already guessed it was a good thing, he no longer resisted. He obediently swallowed it and immediately began to meditate. In a meditative state, the recovery rate of bodily functions would be much faster.\n\nDays passed like this. For the first few days, Nian Bing was basically dazed except when in a meditative state. Physical fatigue often made it difficult for him to breathe, feeling as if he was hovering on the brink of life and death every time. However, after five days, Nian Bing gradually adapted to this life. As time went on, he became more and more convinced that what Galamandis had given him to eat was some kind of tonic, because every time he walked for several hours carrying the Saintly Radiance Blade, his muscles and bones would be aching to the extreme. But as long as he ate that foul-smelling thing and awoke from meditation, his physical condition would recover at least by half, his muscles and bones wouldn't ache as much, and he wouldn't feel hungry at all.\n\n---\n¹ **Ice-Fire Homologization (冰火同源):** A specific magical technique or state where ice and fire elements, normally opposing, are brought into harmony and even can be transformed into each other.\n² **Tiandang Mountain Range (天盪山脈):** A fictional mountain range.\n³ **Sky Splendor Card (天華牌):** A specific magical item mentioned in the story.\n⁴ **Indescribable (無法天空的):** The original Chinese text \"無法天空的\" literally translates to \"cannot sky,\" which is likely a typo for \"無法形容的\" (cannot be described) or \"無法言喻的\" (cannot be expressed/told).

    "content": "Five days passed. Not only did the Sacred Radiance Blade feel much lighter, but even his steps felt much lighter. Most valuable was the progress in his magic power. Cultivating under extreme conditions, just as Galamandis had said, had great benefits for the improvement of both mental power and magic power. Now, the mass of condensed magic power in his chest had shrunk slightly, feeling even more solidified. Nianbing vaguely felt that he seemed to have entered the Archmage realm, but he couldn't be certain yet.\n\nFifteen days after leaving the cave, Nianbing, carrying the Sacred Radiance Blade, agilely followed behind Galamandis and asked doubtfully, \"Great Galamandis, we've been walking for half a month. Why do I feel like we should have left already? Why can't we get out of the mountain range?\" Fifteen days of painful training had turned the originally handsome Nianbing into a savage. His face was covered by a beard, and his golden long hair was tangled and messy. However, the muscles on his body were much firmer than before. Beneath the grime, radiant skin was hidden. The biggest change was in his deep eyes, which sparkled with a captivating brilliance like the stars at night. His vision had greatly improved, making the entire world clearer. After fifteen days of training, the Sacred Radiance Blade was no longer a burden to him. Although he couldn't yet wield it with perfect ease, its weight was at least no longer a threat.\n\nGalamandis said matter-of-factly, \"Of course we can't get out. Because we've been walking in circles.\"\n\nNianbing stared at him dumbfounded, saying, \"Walking in circles? Are you *effing* sick or something?!* No, no, great Galamandis, what I mean is, aren't you in a hurry to go out and eat delicious food?\"\n\nThe chill in Galamandis's eyes receded as he said indifferently, \"As the saying goes, 'To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools.'** If I train you a bit better, it'll save me from losing face when we go out. In another half a month, we'll leave this place. However, from now on, our method of walking will change a bit. Currently, you can rest once after walking for three *shichen***. Hmm, that's too unfair to you, and you're too tired. I've decided to change three *shichen* back to one *shichen*. What do you think? This way, you can't say I'm unkind, right?'\" As he spoke, a sinister smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.\n\nNianbing blinked, \"I didn't hear wrong, did I? Three *shichen* changed to one *shichen*? That's not like your style!?\"\n\nGalamandis lightly waved the twig in his hand and said, \"Of course you didn't hear wrong. However, I need to add one point. Within this one *shichen*, you can choose any method to advance.'\" As he spoke, he suddenly lightly slapped Nianbing with his palm. The Touch Magic Scrolls on Nianbing had long since been used up, and at this moment, there was nothing to block Galamandis's dragon claw. A scorching current instantly spread throughout his body. Nianbing only felt as if a huge gate had severed the connection between himself and his magic power. However, he was already used to Galamandis's actions. He just looked at him with confusion, waiting for him to speak.\n\nGalamandis chuckled and said, \"You can continue advancing now. Remember, it's one *shichen*. But this time, I'll take good care of you from behind.' The twig in his hand danced lightly. Before Nianbing could react, a mark appeared on his body, and the intense pain accompanied by a burning sensation made him jump up. 'What are you doing?'\"\n\nGalamandis looked at him with ill intent and said, \"Nothing. I'm just helping you train your body. Don't you want your magic to improve more? Then you'll have to undergo physical training for the next half month. Come on, you brat. If you've got the guts, dodge my attacks. Of course, you can also use the Sacred Radiance Blade to block, but you'll have to be able to block it. Hurry up and go! Take this whip...'\"\n\nNianbing 'enjoyed' an inhuman life. For one *shichen*, under the Fire Dragon King Galamandis's whip, there was hardly a single intact spot on his body. Fortunately, Galamandis was still merciful; he didn't lay a cruel hand on his critical frontal areas. The sudden change in methods made Nianbing extremely unaccustomed. Fortunately, there was still that foul-smelling stuff to eat to recover his stamina. After one *shichen* ended, Galamandis would first give him that stuff to eat, then lift the magic seal imposed on him, allowing him to heal his wounds himself. After healing, he could meditate for an hour.\n\nHuman patience has its limits. Even Nianbing, who endured humiliation for survival, was no exception. On the third day of being whipped, Nianbing finally couldn't bear it anymore. \"Damn it, Galamandis, you son of a bitch,**** if you hit me again, I'll fight you to the death!\" Wielding the Sacred Radiance Blade in his hand, Nianbing, unable to use magic, had eyes that were almost spitting fire. The intense pain constantly coming from his body made his spirit nearly collapse.\n\nGalamandis flicked the twig in his hand, and with a 'snap,' another red mark appeared on Nianbing's body. \"It's *you* I'm whipping. What? Do you intend to resist?.\"\n\nNianbing's eyes turned red. Twenty days of abuse finally pushed his endurance to the brink of collapse. His mind went blank. All he wanted now was to tear this Fire Dragon King, who had taken human form, into shreds. His entire body surged towards Galamandis like a whirlwind. The Sacred Radiance Blade in his hand, weighing 128 *jin*, was as agile as Morning Dew in his hands at that time.\n\nThe disdain in Galamandis's eyes suddenly turned into surprise. Because he realized that Nianbing had changed. Although he didn't have Battle Qi, at this moment, the Sacred Radiance Blade in his hand had turned into a golden ball of light. Even with Galamandis's eyesight, no pattern could be discerned from this golden light. Every strike was as elusive and traceless as an antelope hanging its horns,****** yet each strike inexplicably contained the profound truths of heaven and earth. That was no longer merely the scope of a blade. Vaguely, Galamandis even saw dragon-shaped currents within that golden light, dragon-shaped currents composed of Light Element. In just the blink of an eye, the Sacred Radiance Blade was already before him. Galamandis was astonished to find that not only could he not dodge, but he didn't even know how to block it. Although he had lived for tens of thousands of years, it was the first time he had seen such a profound blade technique. With no other choice, scarlet Battle Qi surged out, forming a flame-like protective layer around his body. Since evasion or blocking was impossible, he could only rely on his advantage in Qi. Although the Fire Dragon King's Battle Qi was not golden, it was absolutely no worse than a Divine Master's Divine Battle Qi.\n\nDense grinding sounds continuously rang out. Galamandis also didn't know how many times Nianbing had struck his defensive barrier. He could only feel an unusually surging Light Element aura constantly pouring in, though it couldn't harm him. However, this Light Element aura was filled with an indomitable will. If the energy impact hadn't been so vastly different from his own Battle Qi, this aura alone would have been enough to severely wound him. With a cough, the scarlet light suddenly expanded. Nianbing's body was sent flying backward, landing heavily three *zhang******* away along with the Sacred Radiance Blade. Although he was utterly dazed and disoriented******** from the fall, his hand still firmly gripped the Sacred Radiance Blade. The round Sacred Radiance Stone emitted a layer of golden light that spread across Nianbing's entire body. Although the fall seemed severe, he was not injured.\n\nNianbing climbed up from the ground but didn't attack Galamandis again. He looked at the Sacred Radiance Blade in his hand in astonishment, unsure of what to do for a moment. Golden light radiated from the Sacred Radiance Blade's body. That translucent feeling made Nianbing feel as if he had seen the dawn. He knew what he had done. Dragon Dance of the Wind and Rain! Yes, what he had just unleashed with the Sacred Radiance Blade was precisely the Dragon Dance of the Wind and Rain blade technique! If it had been Ghost Carving, Nianbing would naturally have been confident in controlling it with ease. But what was in his hand just now was the Sacred Radiance Blade, weighing 128 *jin*! A four-foot-long blade actually displayed the technique of a carving knife. What was the secret to that? Just the flexibility and coordination of his body alone were incomparable to before. At the moment he performed the Dragon Dance of the Wind and Rain, his body and the blade completely merged, becoming one. The blade aura that naturally appeared on the Sacred Radiance Blade was entirely composed of pure Light Element. His magic was currently sealed, so what had mobilized the Sacred Radiance Blade's aura? It was determination, his indomitable determination! Truly worthy of being the peerless treasure blade that accompanied the Sage Master across the continent for over seventy years. Sacred Radiance, oh Sacred Radiance, now you've finally fully recognized me.\n\nHis gaze on the blade was filled with emotion. A hazy mist appeared in Nianbing's eyes. This treasured blade of the Sage Master, after ten thousand years, once again had a new master.\n\n\"Good blade technique. What's the name of this technique?\" Galamandis's voice came.\n\nNianbing murmured, \"Dragon Dance of the Wind and Rain. It's a blade technique my first teacher taught me. You might not believe it, but it's used for carving in culinary arts. To evaluate a person's culinary skills, one must consider five aspects: Color, Aroma, Taste, Intent, and Form. And the Dragon Dance of the Wind and Rain blade technique is precisely the peak manifestation of 'Form.' Galamandis, thank you. If it weren't for your coercion, I would absolutely not have been able to use Sacred Radiance to perform the Dragon Dance of the Wind and Rain.\"\n\n\"Thanks? No need, no need. Just make more delicious food for me to eat later. I didn't have any good intentions, so feel free to hate me. However, seeking revenge seems difficult.\" Galamandis's voice contained arrogance, along with a hint of humor. Nianbing looked up and met his gaze. Their eyes met, and both couldn't help but smile.\n\nNianbing glanced at the twig in Galamandis's hand. \"Shall we continue?\"\n\nGalamandis shook his head and said, \"There's no need for that anymore. Unless I use my absolutely superior Head Qi,********* I won't be able to hit you with speed anymore. Your physical training can end early. In the future, when you have free time, practice with the Sacred Radiance Blade more. For you, a mage, these physical conditions are already sufficient. It's time for us to leave this place.\"\n\nNianbing stood up, and just as he was about to say something, Galamandis raised his hand towards him. A brilliant golden light streamed into the Sacred Radiance Blade. In an instant, golden light enveloped Nianbing's entire body from the blade. Wrapped in the golden light, the wounds on his body quickly healed. Galamandis's hand didn't lower; instead, the golden light on it turned white. He swiftly drew a white Six-pointed Star, murmuring incantations. His magic power seemed infinite, and a ninth-tier spell gradually formed. The white light expanded as it diffused, enveloping Galamandis's body and also Nianbing's body. The white light instantly method (Original text is like this; I couldn't think of what word it should be.).********** The white Six-pointed Star transformed into silver, completely covering their location. The light abruptly converged, and the last thing to vanish in the air was a silver speck of light.\n\nA strange sensation made Nianbing feel as if he had arrived in another world, but then he suddenly jolted. When everything became clear again, he found that the surrounding mountains had disappeared. Biting cold invaded his barely clothed body, sending a shiver through him. Yet, the severe winter cold didn't make him feel much discomfort.\n\nBefore him was a river, a wide river, leading to an unknown place. The river surface had long since frozen due to the winter cold. From the spring-like warm valley to this icy river in a world of ice and snow, the vast difference still made Nianbing feel very unaccustomed. Just as he was about to ask Galamandis for his Spatial Ring back to retrieve some warm clothes, a huge fireball suddenly flew out from behind him.\n\nThe same fireball, when used by the Fire Dragon King Galamandis, had a power that was absolutely incomparable. The fireball surged forth with a piercing roar. Amidst a thunderous boom, ice shards splattered across the river surface. Under the influence of the scorching current, the river water beneath the ice surged out like a fountain, even bringing out a few fish that were instantly cooked.\n\nA great force came from his backside, and Nianbing once again experienced the feeling of soaring through clouds and mist. He flailed his limbs as he flew dozens of *zhang*. Before he could even make a move, his body plunged into the river with a splash. Galamandis's powerful Fireball spell certainly made the water instantly boil, but the river flowed, constantly moving. When Nianbing fell into the water, the bone-chilling river water immediately sent convulsions through his entire body. The river's powerful current carried his body downstream.\n___\n**Footnotes:**\n*   * Effing: The character \"丫\" (yā) is a colloquial, somewhat rude exclamation, similar to \"damn\" or \"f*cking.\"\n*   ** \"To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools\": A well-known Chinese proverb (工欲善其事，必先利其器, *gōng yù shàn qí shì, bì xiān lì qí qì*).\n*   *** *Shichen*: A traditional Chinese unit of time, equivalent to two hours.\n*   **** Son of a bitch: The original Chinese uses \"五八蛋\" (wǔbādàn), a playful but still insulting variation of \"王八蛋\" (wángbādàn), which literally means \"king eight egg\" but is a common curse equivalent to \"bastard\" or \"son of a bitch.\" The \"五\" (five) is a homophone for \"王\" (king).\n*   ***** *Jin*: A traditional Chinese unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kilograms or 1.1 pounds.

    "content": "A red figure appeared on the unbroken ice surface. Garamandis emanated a blue glow from his entire body. The river water, which had been surging and flowing beneath the ice, instantly became still. Nianbing’s body was thus preserved within the icy water of the cave.\n\nWhile learning culinary arts with Chaji, Nianbing often played in the not-very-turbulent waters of the Sky Blue River. But that didn't mean he could swim freely in an icy river. The moment he surfaced from the water, he desperately swam towards the shore, hoping to get out quickly. At that moment, he couldn't even spare a thought for cursing Garamandis.\n\n\"Kid, do you want to come up? Stop dreaming. First, get yourself cleaned up for me. Otherwise, you can forget about leaving the river.\" The only thing Garamandis did that could be considered decent was, when he kicked Nianbing away, he left the Holy Radiance Blade in Nianbing's hand. Otherwise, Nianbing would have already sunk to the bottom.\n\n\"You, you... you... cra... zy... man, this... is... so... cold, cold... river... water. Do you... want... me... to die...?\" In the extreme cold, Nianbing was already speaking incoherently.\n\nGaramandis chuckled and said, \"Don't worry, you won't die with me here. You can't even die if you want to. Hurry up and wash. If you don't want to keep soaking in icy water, that is.\"\n\nThe cold seemed to have congealed his blood. Let alone bathing, even moving his body became extremely difficult. Just as Nianbing despairingly thought he would freeze to death here, something strange happened. A stream of heat suddenly emerged from his lower abdomen. The warm current instantly filled his chest and abdomen, greatly diminishing the cold within him. Just as Nianbing's mind cleared a little, the stream of heat gradually intensified. When he looked down, he found that his skin was emitting a lustrous red glow. A scorching sensation continuously filled his limbs and bones. At this point, soaking in the icy river was no longer painful. The external cold neutralized the internal heat flow, making Nianbing feel exceptionally comfortable. He moved his body in the water, and couldn't help but look at Garamandis on the shore in surprise.\n\n\"Great Garamandis, what exactly were those foul-smelling things you made me eat?\" The changes in his body could only be explained by the things he had been eating for over twenty days.\n\nGaramandis chuckled. He said, \"What if I told you it was my feces? Would you believe me?\"\n\n\"You...\" Nianbing realized that in every aspect, he was always at a disadvantage against Garamandis. A giant dragon that had lived for tens of thousands of years had almost no flaws in wisdom.\n\n\"Don't worry, even if you wanted to eat my dragon feces, I wouldn't bear to give them to you. Hurry up and wash. These past days, you've been eating the gallbladders of the Iron Thread Snakes unique to the Heavenly Abyss Mountain Range. They are specifically for changing your physical constitution. Iron Thread Snakes are naturally cold-natured, but their gallbladders are different from ordinary snake gallbladders. Not only do they not have a cooling, 'fire-reducing' effect, instead, they are extremely hot substances. They are very beneficial for your body. Now, wash them off in the icy river to remove all the intense heat, and only then can you fully absorb them. The gallbladders of hundred-year-old Iron Thread Snakes are not something ordinary people can get their hands on. You should know, a single hundred-year-old Iron Thread Snake can easily kill several Iron North Earth Dragons. I caught all of them while you were meditating.\" In fact, Nianbing didn't just eat hundred-year-old Iron Thread Snake gallbladders. Some were even over a thousand years old. With such powerful nourishment, his body's resilience at this moment was incomparable not only to mages but also to any martial artists. Although he lacked scales compared to a dragon, the strength of his skin and meridians could already rival that of ordinary giant dragons. This was also a crucial reason why Nianbing was later known as the 'undying mage'.\n\nFloating in the river water, Nianbing gazed somewhat blankly at Garamandis, who had an indifferent expression. Recalling everything that had happened, from leaving the cave until now, although he had constantly put himself through immense suffering, all of it seemed to be for his own good. Nianbing felt a bit bewildered. What exactly did this great Garamandis want to do with him?\n\nHe washed for a full half-hour before Nianbing completely washed off the dirt accumulated over a month. After getting ashore, he used the Holy Radiance Blade to shave off the beard on his face. The handsome and dashing Nianbing reappeared.\n\n\"Here.\" He tossed the Spatial Ring to Nianbing. With a casual pat on his shoulder, the magic seal within Nianbing's body was instantly lifted. Changing into a set of dry coarse cloth clothes, and feeling the power of his Dual Ice-Fire Origin, Nianbing clearly felt that he was stronger than ever before.\n\n\"The weather's cold, and there's a river here, so naturally there are fish. I'll make you some fish soup to drink.\" Nianbing, now dressed, looked at Garamandis and said calmly.\n\nGaramandis glanced at him and said, \"What, trying to bribe me? I know what you're thinking; you really don't need to feel any gratitude towards me. The reason I helped you improve your strength wasn't out of good intentions. Ample stamina will allow you to cast magic better, and likewise, to make delicious food for me better, so you won't get tired. Hmm. Though clean, you're not as handsome as me, but you'll reluctantly do.\"\n\nNianbing was almost infuriated to death by Garamandis. It seemed impossible to hear a good word from him. He simply stopped talking, and watched this self-proclaimed great Fire Dragon King with a gloomy expression.\n\n\"What are you looking at me for? Weren't you going to make me fish soup? I haven't eaten anything you've made for almost a month; I'm actually quite hungry. Remember to make a lot; you know my stomach.\"\n\n\"Great Garamandis, I think if you were to die in the future, the way you'd choose to die would definitely be from overeating. Gluttonous dragon.\" Dropping that remark, he walked straight towards the riverbank.\n\nGaramandis stroked his handsome face and muttered to himself, \"Have I been too good to this kid? He's getting more and more impudent. Never mind, who told him he had so much utilitarian value? It's only right to be a bit good to him.\" Was he truly helping Nianbing improve his strength just for his own stomach? As a Fire Dragon King with tens of thousands of years of wisdom, he weighed all pros and cons. Only he himself knew why he was doing this.\n\nAlthough Nianbing insulted Garamandis verbally, he showed no slackness in his culinary execution. Using the few remaining ingredients in his Spatial Ring, and then catching several fish from the icy river using the Extreme Freeze method, with his increasingly flexible control over his magic power, he created a perfect dish: Eight Extremities Freshness of Ice and Fire.\n\n\"Wow, so fish soup can be this delicious. Excellent, truly excellent.\" Garamandis took a mouthful of the rich, hot soup. He only felt that his dragon body was greatly refreshed, and praised Nianbing's craftsmanship with admiration.\n\nNianbing didn't idle either. He seemed to vent all his dissatisfaction with Garamandis onto the food, eating and drinking large mouthfuls of the delicious food he had made. In the cold winter, eating tender fish meat, along with delicious fish soup and condiments, the flavor was truly a delicacy among mortals. His tightly strung nerves from these past days found excellent relief in his top-tier culinary skills.\n\n\"Nianbing kid, we're already out of the Heavenly Abyss Mountain Range. This place is twenty li* from Heavenly Abyss City. Where should we go next? Where are there good things to eat?\" Garamandis, holding the iron pot and showing no table manners, asked after drinking the last mouthful of fish soup.\n\nHearing his question, Nianbing's spirits lifted. Various thoughts constantly flashed through his mind. Ever since he realized that Garamandis no longer posed a great threat to him, his mind had become active. It was clear that this great Fire Dragon King was using him, whether for his culinary skills or something else. Wanting to get rid of a dragon? It probably wouldn't be that easy. Since that was the case, he might as well use him in return. Having a dragon by his side might not necessarily be a bad thing.\n\nThinking of this, Nianbing said, \"Great Garamandis, there are five great empires on the Yangguang Continent. The most prosperous are the capitals of these five empires. And the closest to us right now is Olan City, the capital of the Olan Empire. I've never been there before, but I imagine a prosperous place is bound to have delicious things. Let's go to Olan City.\"\n\nGaramandis did not disappoint Nianbing. He put the iron pot aside, nodded, and said, \"Alright, Olan City it is. Your human world changes too quickly. I remember when I came out to play a few hundred years ago, it wasn't like this with the Five Great Empires. You're more familiar than I am, so you arrange our journey to eat all the delicacies.\"\n\nNianbing smiled slightly and said, \"Don't worry, I will definitely make the best arrangements, ensuring your trip is worthwhile.\"\n\nAs if Garamandis hadn't heard the deeper meaning in Nianbing's words, he laughed heartily and said, \"Good, since we're going to your human world, you don't need to call me 'Great' anymore. Just call me by my name. This is the first time I've granted this privilege to a human. From now on, just follow me. Who knows, maybe one day if I'm happy, I'll give you some more benefits.\"\n\nNianbing said, \"Garamandis, you know that my Dual Ice-Fire Origin has made considerable progress with your 'help'. I also feel I have a deeper understanding of both ice and fire magic elements. Now, can I learn your Mimicry skill?\"\n\nGaramandis snorted disdainfully and said, \"You're still very far off. To learn my Mimicry skill, you'd at least have to be able to transform from ice to fire, and then from fire back to ice. Only then might it be possible. What you currently understand is merely the most superficial aspect of magic elements. Every magic element has different properties. You already have four blades now. When you have free time, you need to feel and understand the inherent properties of the wind and light magic elements more. Only then will you possibly be able to cultivate Mimicry in the future. Furthermore, Mimicry requires a large amount of magic power to support it, especially during the process of mutual conversion. If your understanding of magic elements isn't sufficient, using Mimicry won't grant you greater power; instead, it will consume your magic power exponentially. Without powerful magic power, you don't even have the qualification to cultivate Mimicry. Looking at your current situation, you can only be considered to have barely entered what you humans call the Magic Grandmaster realm. Magic Grandmasters are also not all the same. Can you use ninth-tier magic now? Only when you can use ninth-tier magic will you be qualified to cultivate Mimicry based on your Dual Ice-Fire Origin.\"\n\n\"Do I have to reach the level where I can cultivate ninth-tier magic?\" A hint of disappointment was evident in Nianbing's voice.\n\nGaramandis chuckled and said, \"Of course, that's not absolute. With external help, even with slightly lower conditions, you can still use it. It's just that this external help isn't that easy to obtain.\"\n\nNianbing looked at Garamandis's profound and unfathomable expression, and quickly said with a flattering smile, \"Of course, how could we humans easily learn such a unique skill as Mimicry? Great Garamandis, is there some shortcut you can tell me about?\"\n\nGaramandis snorted, saying, \"There's no harm in telling you. It's actually quite easy. As long as your magic power is a bit stronger and stable at the Magic Grandmaster realm, you can start trying. As for this so-called shortcut, it's about relying on certain special items to give you a basis when performing Mimicry. Of course, these special items must possess an extremely pure magic element of a certain type. You kid are quite lucky; you already have four of them now. Didn't I just say that in a few days you can start trying to sense the elements of light and wind?\"\n\nNianbing's eyes lit up, and he said, \"Are you saying that the gems attached to my magic blades can help me achieve the ability of Mimicry?\"\n\nGaramandis said, \"Of course. Do you think the 'supreme grade' in 'supreme grade gems' is just for show? Any supreme grade gem, as long as its energy can be fully unleashed, can qualitatively improve your magic. It's just that your current magic power is still too weak to truly draw out their inner potential. But with the Holy Radiance Blade and your so-called Heaven's Pride Blade, using them as guidance and your Dual Ice-Fire Origin as a foundation, you can start trying to cultivate Mimicry.\"\n\nNianbing thought for a moment and said, \"So, if I could also get supreme grade magic blades of the darkness, spatial, and earth elements, I could cultivate Mimicry even at the Magic Grandmaster level?\"\n\nGaramandis nodded and said, \"Theoretically, yes. While it wouldn't be true Mimicry of your inherent ability, being able to cultivate Mimicry with the aid of external objects would make it much easier for you to truly master Mimicry. However, do you think supreme grade magic blades are that easy to obtain? Unless by sheer coincidence, otherwise, even if you spent your entire life searching, you might not find a single one.\"\n\nNianbing smiled, \"It's alright, I'm not in a hurry. I have plenty of time. Having a goal is always good. Great Garamandis, you've also eaten your fill, shouldn't we be on our way to Olan City now?\"\n\nGaramandis rolled his eyes and said, \"Who said I'm full? I need at least three more servings of fish soup like before.\"\n\nNianbing: \"...\"\n\n---\n* *Li*: A traditional Chinese unit of distance, approximately 0.5 kilometers or 0.3 miles.",

    "content": "Embarking on the road to Olan City, Galamandis no longer made things difficult for Nian Bing. The man and the dragon, like friends, walked slowly along the main road. For Galamandis, the concept of time simply didn't exist; having lived for tens of thousands of years, it knew very well how to enjoy life. Nian Bing had originally wanted to use magic to hasten their journey, but Galamandis stopped him, saying that only by walking could they better experience the beauty of the human world.\n\nAs days went by, the arrival of March brought a touch of warmth. After several months of recuperation, the Olan Empire, which had been greatly damaged by war, was steadily recovering. At least, that was how it appeared on the surface.\n\n\"Nian Bing, how much farther until we reach Olan City?\" Galamandis asked, while looking at the tender shoots emerging on the trees along the roadside.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"I just checked the map. At our current pace, we'll reach it in three more days at most.\"\n\nGalamandis excitedly said, \"So that means I'll soon have good things to eat?\"\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile and said, \"Great Galamandis, haven't you eaten enough along the way? Forget about when we pass through cities; even when we pass a small village, you insist on feasting for several days before agreeing to continue.\" As they traveled, he became increasingly convinced that Galamandis's original claim of helping him improve his physical abilities was just so he could keep cooking better. Whenever they reached a place where food ingredients could be bought, Galamandis would insist on stopping for Nian Bing to cook him all sorts of delicacies for several days. While it was excellent for practicing his culinary skills, Nian Bing was now increasingly worried that if they continued at this pace, he wouldn't make it to the Huarong Empire for the New Generation Magician Competition after delivering his letter in Olan City. However, what comforted him was that ever since leaving the Fire Dragon Cave, not only had his physical body made tremendous leaps, but the progress in his magic alone had thrilled him. While the cultivation of magic power required time, he had gained much insight into magic control techniques and the use of mimicry magic. Galamandis's love for food wasn't a bad thing; whenever Nian Bing encountered a difficult problem, as long as he wholeheartedly cooked a grand meal for him, he could definitely coax out some information he needed from Galamandis. For Nian Bing, Galamandis was now a walking magic treasure trove.\n\nGalamandis snorted and said, \"Don't forget how big my true body is. Of course, I need to eat a lot to maintain my excellent physique! What? Do you have any complaints?\"\n\nNian Bing grumbled, \"It's not that I'm dissatisfied. It's just that you, who possess so much treasure, have been eating my meager human money all this way. My savings are gone. Shouldn't you contribute some money for our future meals!?\"\n\n\"Hmph, stinky brat, do you want to eat the great Galamandis? I don't have money. I didn't bring a single gold coin. Didn't you say you could sell magic scrolls for money? Just sell some when we reach Olan City.\"\n\nNian Bing said with a bitter face, \"But I need magic scrolls to sell them! All the scrolls I had were used up long ago in the Tiandang Mountains, and you've eaten all my money, so I can't even buy blank scrolls. How am I supposed to sell anything?\"\n\nGalamandis laughed like a child, revealing a mouthful of white teeth, and said, \"That's your business, what does it have to do with me? Anyway, if I don't get delicious food, you'd better watch out. I don't mind repeating the training I put you through in the Tiandang Mountains a few more times. I have all the time in the world to play with you, anyway.\"\n\n\"You...\" Looking at Galamandis's rascally appearance, Nian Bing truly had no way to deal with him. Meeting such a lordly figure, he could only endure it.\n\nAs they walked, the sound of cartwheels grinding against the ground came from ahead, growing from faint to clear. Nian Bing looked up and saw a group resembling a merchant caravan approaching them and Galamandis.\n\nAt the front of the caravan was the most common component on the continent—mercenaries. Over a dozen mercenaries formed a V-shaped formation, guarding the leading carriage. The carriages looked ordinary from the outside, but despite there being only a dozen or so carriages in total, they were protected by over a hundred mercenaries. Judging by the appearance of these mercenaries, their abilities should be quite good; they were at least high-level warriors. It seemed this caravan was very lucrative indeed!¹\n\n\"Hm? Nian Bing, that's a human caravan, isn't it?\" Galamandis, who Nian Bing had noticed, naturally saw it too.\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"It should be. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many mercenaries.\"\n\nGalamandis chuckled and said, \"Problem solved. Aren't you out of money? There are so many people in this caravan, and they must have plenty of valuable things. Go rob them, and then we'll have money for food, won't we?\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes widened as he looked at the nonchalant Galamandis, his voice raising a few octaves, \"You want me to rob them?\"\n\nGalamandis said as if it were obvious, \"Of course, if you don't have money, just rob them. Anyway, whether the money is spent by them or by us, it's still spent. Hurry up and go. As long as you snatch enough money, I'll tell you about that light element question you asked yesterday. How about it? Isn't that a good deal?\"\n\nNian Bing said, exasperated, \"But, great Galamandis, I'm a chef, or rather, a magician. For you to make me a bandit in broad daylight, isn't that a bit inappropriate? If I run into Olan Empire soldiers, I won't be able to clear my name even if I jump into the Sky Blue River.² We're currently within the Olan Empire's borders. If we become street rats³ later, what good will delicious food be?\"⁴\n\nGalamandis snorted and said, \"Why so much nonsense? Don't talk to me about the pros and cons; it has nothing to do with me. I only know that money can buy food. Go quickly, or don't blame me for being impolite to you. Don't forget, I can take your life anytime.\"\n\nAlthough Nian Bing understood that Galamandis wouldn't truly kill him, he also understood that if he didn't comply with Galamandis's wishes, his future days would likely be difficult. With a helpless sigh, and while the caravan hadn't yet noticed them, he quickly took out his magician's attire from his spatial ring, put it on, and donned a mask, finally feeling a bit better.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing's get-up, Galamandis burst into laughter. \"Why do you look like a clown? Hurry up and go, I'll wait for you here. Look, what are you looking at? Do you think the noble, great Galamandis would engage in such a shameless act as robbery?\"\n\nSpeechless. You can't be shameless, so you order me to be shameless? What kind of logic is that? Oh, right, there's no reasoning with him at all. Too lazy to say anything more, Nian Bing cast a Blizzard spell on himself. Without the protection of magic scrolls now, he naturally had to be more cautious in all aspects.\n\nThe caravan and Nian Bing steadily drew closer. Nian Bing walked to the center of the road, blocking the caravan's path, and stood still. Meanwhile, Galamandis had already gone to rest by the roadside, incidentally enjoying the show.⁵\n\nThe mercenaries naturally noticed this uninvited guest. They each drew their weapons. But Nian Bing was only one person, after all, so they weren't overly tense. Three of the leading mercenaries spurred their horses, suddenly accelerating towards Nian Bing, reaching him in the blink of an eye.\n\nOne of the mercenaries was tall, appearing to be in his forties. The standard mercenary leather armor on him looked imposing. His bald head gleamed in the sunlight, and his rough features made him seem like a straightforward person. \"Friend, we need to pass this way. Could you please let us through?\" he said politely to Nian Bing. After all, mercenaries were on assignment, and no one wanted to stir up extra trouble.\n\nNian Bing sighed inwardly. He deliberately made his voice a little hoarse, \"Cut the nonsense. Hand over some toll money, and I'll let you pass. I'm robbing you.\" It was his first time doing something like this, and that was the only opening line he could manage.\n\nThe three mercenaries opposite him were veterans of the mercenary trade; as soon as they heard Nian Bing's words, they understood they had encountered a rookie bandit. The two mercenaries beside him were about to act but were stopped by the one who had spoken earlier. The mercenary, sticking out his gleaming bald head, casually said to Nian Bing, \"Brother, at home, rely on your parents; away from home, rely on your friends.⁶ Our Blade King Mercenary Group will make a friend of you. Everyone calls me Liulang, and my nickname is 'Gilded Blade'. Take this money.\" As he spoke, he pulled out a rather dirty money pouch from his懷 and threw it to Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing took the money pouch, opened it, and was surprised to find over a dozen gold coins inside. He couldn't help but wonder, was being a bandit this easy nowadays? Just say a few words and get money? This was too simple. Although he thought this, he felt it was good; this way, he wouldn't have to force himself to be a bandit. Just as he was about to clear the path, Galamandis's voice, as if wishing for chaos, rang in his ear, \"Too little! It's not enough to fill me up even once. Their caravan is so big, this amount of money won't do. You figure it out yourself.\" Although he didn't know how the sound was transmitted, Nian Bing was sure that only he could hear it.⁷\n\nIn his heart, Nian Bing cursed Galamandis's ancestors eighteen generations back, but he couldn't resist. He could only stiffen his neck and say, \"Brother Liulang, while generous, this small amount isn't enough to buy passage.\"\n\nLiulang's brows furrowed slightly. The reason he chose to pay for passage was primarily due to the faint, elusive aura emanating from Nian Bing. Although outwardly rugged, his mind was very meticulous, and he absolutely did not want to make unnecessary enemies. Now, seeing that the other party had taken his money but still had no intention of letting the caravan pass, Liulang couldn't help but inwardly curse this rookie for not knowing better.⁸ He calmly said, \"So, you're not planning to let us go?\"\n\nAt this point, Nian Bing no longer harbored any wishful thinking. He said coldly, \"One thousand gold coins, and I'll let you pass. Think carefully about it.\" As he spoke, without chanting a spell, he pressed his right hand into the air towards the roadside. A red and blue intertwined current of energy flowed out. The color distinction between the currents wasn't very obvious. Just as the three mercenaries were stunned for a moment, a deafening explosion erupted. The red and blue lights instantly condensed into a light ball that violently exploded on the ground beside the road. Three large trees were uprooted, and a crater nearly ten feet in diameter appeared. Although it was somewhat shallow, its power was considerable. Some of the fallen branches on the ground turned into charcoal, while others were covered in frost.\n\nNian Bing felt a slight sense of pride. The breakthrough in Ice-Fire Homologous allowed him to no longer need to use different spells from each hand separately and then collide them in the air to unleash the power of Ice-Fire Homologous. Directly outputting it as mixed Ice-Fire Homologous magic power no longer required chanting spells. Furthermore, with the influence of mimicry magic, he now didn't even need incantations to use a second-tier Ice-Fire Homologous spell. Now, Nian Bing was starting to suspect that he didn't seem like a magician at all, but rather more like a warrior.\n\nSomething unexpected happened: Nian Bing's powerful strike did not make the three knights on horseback change their expressions. Especially the one named Gilded Blade, who remained calm, sitting nonchalantly on his horse, looking at Nian Bing with a faint smile, \"Are you done with your performance? That's Ice-Flame Palm, isn't it? It's been many years since I've seen this kind of battle qi. Good, good, good. It seems you're worth me loosening my muscles a bit.\" He pressed a hand on his saddle, and his tall body leaped into the air, landing in front of Nian Bing. The other two knights' faces revealed expressions of enjoying the show, watching Nian Bing with relaxed demeanors.\n\nFrom closer up, Nian Bing carefully examined the mercenary in front of him. Liulang was half a head taller than him, and his shoulders were extremely broad. At this moment, he had drawn a huge saber from his back. Nian Bing was surprised to find that this great saber, in both size and style, was identical to his own Holy Radiance. The saber was as light as nothing in Liulang's hand. Liulang raised the large saber, pointing it at Nian Bing, and said, \"Kid, come on. Let's see if you're worth a thousand gold coins.\"\n\nThe opponent's calmness and relaxed demeanor made Nian Bing's heart tighten slightly. He was not a careless person. He brought his hands together and then apart, and the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Flame God appeared in his grasp respectively. Two different auras, ice and fire, permeated the air around his body.\n\nChuckling, Liulang revealed his large front teeth. \"Not bad, good blades. They perfectly match your Ice-Flame battle qi. Come on, let me see what level your Ice-Flame battle qi cultivation has reached.\"\n\nNian Bing felt a bead of sweat roll down his mind!⁹ The opponent actually took him for a warrior. However, that was good; the opponent's misjudgment would provide him with more opportunities. Tapping his toes lightly on the ground, his body floated backward. Due to his understanding of the ice element, the Blizzard he used was now in an invisible state. Unless someone came close enough to feel the rapidly rotating battle qi, no one would be able to discover that he had applied Blizzard magic to himself.\n***\n¹ *Oil and water are very fat (油水很肥)*: An idiom implying something is very profitable, lucrative, or contains much valuable stuff.\n² *Even if you jump into the Sky Blue River, you won't be able to wash yourself clean (跳進天青河也洗不清了)*: An idiom meaning \"one will never be able to clear their name or reputation.\"\n³ *Street rats (過街老鼠)*: An idiom referring to someone who is universally despised or hunted.\n⁴ *What good will delicious food be (還吃個屁美食)*: A crude exclamation implying that the situation makes enjoying food impossible or irrelevant.\n⁵ *Enjoying the show (看好戲)*: Lit. \"watching a good show,\" meaning to enjoy watching a spectacle unfold, often implying someone else's misfortune or a dramatic event.\n⁶ *At home, rely on your parents; away from home, rely on your friends (在家靠父母，出門靠朋友)*: A common Chinese saying emphasizing the importance of mutual support among friends when traveling or living away from home.\n⁷ *Wishing for chaos (惟恐天下不亂)*: An idiom describing someone who delights in causing trouble or mischief.\n⁸ *Not knowing better (不識相)*: An idiom meaning \"not knowing how to read the room\" or \"not knowing what's good for him,\" implying a lack of awareness or tact in a situation.\n⁹ *A bead of sweat roll down his mind (心中這個汗啊)*: A common online expression (or internet slang) used to convey a feeling of awkwardness, embarrassment, or being speechless/flustered by someone else's actions or words.",

    "content": "Gilded Blade Roamer's eyes suddenly changed. His right foot stepped forward abruptly, changing to a two-handed grip on his blade. He let out a loud roar, like a thunderclap in the sky, and the giant blade, appearing like a holy radiance, slashed out like lightning. A faint golden light formed an arc, shooting straight towards Nie Bing. The reason he underestimated Nie Bing was actually because of the Ice-Fire Dou Qi he recognized. This type of Dou Qi indeed existed, and while very domineering, it was difficult to train to higher realms due to the conflict between ice and fire, which was why he was so confident.\n\nSeeing the faint golden blade glow, Nie Bing's heart was greatly alarmed. He had never imagined that this seemingly reckless mercenary before him was actually a Light Knight. Light-elemental magic was rarely cultivated among mages; it was a privilege of the Papal Priests. And Light-elemental Dou Qi was even rarer, even scarcer than Dark Dou Qi. Not only because it was extremely difficult to cultivate, but also because Light-elemental Dou Qi had too many restrictions.\n\nTo cultivate Light-elemental Dou Qi, the most basic requirement was to possess a Body of Light. This alone was one in a thousand among ordinary people, and it wasn't even the key. Even with just a Body of Light, cultivating Light-elemental Dou Qi was still very difficult; the progress speed was only one-fifth that of ordinary Dou Qi. Therefore, to achieve something in Light-elemental Dou Qi, one had to obtain the recognition of the Light Element. This was not something ordinary people could achieve, because the prerequisite for gaining the Light Element's recognition was to be magnanimous and act with integrity. As long as there was a single despicable thought in one's heart, it would be impossible to gain the Light Element's recognition.\n\nOnce these two conditions were met, one could begin cultivating Light Dou Qi. However, if darkness appeared in the heart of a warrior cultivating Light Dou Qi during the process, the Light Element would abandon him without hesitation. Without the Light Element's support, the power of Light Dou Qi would inevitably be greatly diminished. This was the only restriction among all types of Dou Qi. Therefore, choosing to cultivate Light-elemental Dou Qi required not only excellent talent but also a nearly perfect disposition.\n\nOn the Yangguang Continent, anyone who cultivated Light Dou Qi would naturally receive the title of Light Knight. They were also talents that various empires vied to recruit, because Light Knights were beyond any suspicion; once recruited, they would always be the most capable subordinates. One would never have to worry about them betraying, nor about them doing anything detrimental to oneself. It could be said that the number of Light Knights was extremely rare, and Light Knights who could cultivate Light Dou Qi to high realms were even scarcer.\n\nOf course, because Light Dou Qi was difficult to cultivate, if truly mastered, its power would also surpass other forms of Dou Qi. Its most significant characteristic was its suppression of Dark Dou Qi. Upon encountering creatures with dark aura, a Light Knight's strength would appear extremely formidable. In the face of Light Dou Qi, darkness would be difficult to contend with unless there was a vast difference in strength. Even other types of Dou Qi, when encountering Light Dou Qi of equal level, would be stunned by the opponent's dauntless spirit, able to exert less than eighty percent of their strength.\n\nTherefore, when Nie Bing discovered that the opponent was actually using Light Dou Qi, his astonishment was boundless. But he no longer had time for regrets. As his body drifted backward, he thrust his two magic blades forward. Light shone, and the same Ice-Fire Origin magic power as before burst forth interchangeably. However, this time, with the amplification from the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God, the effect was much stronger than before, and this time, Nie Bing used a Tier 2 magic.\n\nUnder Nie Bing's exquisite control, the two layers of ice and fire energy, upon contact with the opponent's Light Dou Qi, immediately produced a triple explosion. This was Nie Bing's ingenuity. Relying on his formidable magic power after entering the Archmage realm, he could perfectly achieve triple magic stacking. This was also the strongest attack he could unleash without chanting spells. Although a considerable amount of magic power would be lost during the stacking, the power was astonishing.\n\nA grating friction sound and violent explosions rang out simultaneously. The strong rebound force made Nie Bing feel a warmth throughout his body—that was the aura of light. Fortunately, he reacted quickly. The opponent's battle blade, after breaking through the intense explosions, had its power greatly diminished. He then used the momentum to retreat, thus avoiding being touched by the Dou Qi on the blade.\n\n\"Good, it's not easy for Ice-Fire Dou Qi to be cultivated to this extent. Why be a bandit? Come be a mercenary instead. Hahahahaha.\" Roamer did not pursue. With his large battle blade resting on his shoulder, he looked at Nie Bing with a half-smile.\n\nNie Bing now finally understood why Roamer's epithet was \"Gilded Blade.\" With Light Dou Qi, his battle blade glittered with golden light, truly like something gilded. \"Brother Roamer, do you know how ugly your smile is? Especially, you should brush your teeth.\"\n\nThe laughter abruptly stopped. Roamer closed his mouth, preventing his large yellow teeth from showing. He said angrily, \"I hate it most when people talk about my teeth! Little bandit, go. I don't want to kill.\"\n\nNie Bing's two magic blades each pointed to the ground beside him. He said calmly, \"But I must rob.\" Roamer's strength had already aroused his competitive spirit. Now, even without Galamandis's request, he wanted to contend with this Light Knight. \"I just don't understand, why would a dignified Light Knight like you become a mercenary?\"\n\nRoamer said, \"I also don't understand, why would a dignified successor of Ice-Fire Dou Qi like you become a bandit? As far as I know, your family should be quite wealthy, right?\"\n\nNie Bing offered no explanation. While mobilizing his magic power, he began chanting a spell. At this distance, while not enough to chant a stronger spell, there was still enough time to chant a Tier 4 spell. He chose a fire-elemental spell. Coupled with the blizzard beneath his feet, it was also an excellent Ice-Fire Origin attack. With Ice-Fire Origin reaching Tier 4, its power was already quite considerable.\n\nIn fact, on the surface, Nie Bing was still at a disadvantage. After all, he was a mage, not a warrior. When a mage engaged in direct combat with a warrior, it was very disadvantageous without the aid of magic scrolls, because spells required time.\n\nNie Bing's spell chanting was very soft; Roamer could only see his lips move. Red airflow continuously gathered along the direction of the Sun Blade. Nie Bing's eyes brightened, and two cold glints shot out from behind his skull mask. He raised both hands, and the blizzard beneath his feet took form, combined with a single-target Wall of Fire spell, moving up and down, rushing towards Roamer.\n\nRoamer looked at the oncoming attack, a hint of surprise in his eyes. \"When did Ice-Fire Dou Qi become usable like this? Kid, you're not bad!\" This time, he leaped up. The golden light originally on his blade instantly spread throughout his body. Light Dou Qi, like golden flames, enveloped his form. It was also a straightforward vertical chop, but this time, the momentum was much more formidable.\n\nThe golden light was like the creation of heaven and earth. Nie Bing only had time to control the Ice-Fire Origin explosion when the resplendent golden light had already descended. He clearly saw a trace of silvery abnormality flash in the golden light when it made contact with his magic. Under the shock in his heart, he didn't even think further. He didn't even have time to turn around, alternately touching the ground with his feet, rapidly retreating.\n\nThe air seemed to still for an instant. The exploding Ice-Fire Origin simultaneously unleashed its due power. However, neither the coldness of ice nor the scorching heat of fire could penetrate the silvery golden light; they were automatically repelled. The giant battle blade, as if chopping firewood, actually cut Nie Bing's proud magic in two with a single strike. At the same time, the blade light shot forward, catching up to Nie Bing's body like lightning.\n\nWhat could Nie Bing do now? He could no longer rely on his magic. Even a Tier 1 magic required activating magic power, and he simply didn't have the time. In a critical moment, his reaction was swift. He moved his two magic blades up and down in unison, and two rays of light, one blue and one red, converged in front of him. Relying on the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God, he directly resisted the opponent's blade light.\n\nIce-Fire Origin was the combination of two extreme magics; the power it could unleash was incomparable to single-element magic. Although Roamer's Light Dou Qi smoothly cut through Nie Bing's magic, it wasn't as effortless as it appeared. The blade glow he unleashed was already at the end of its strength.\n\nNie Bing's hands shook violently. The Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God were simultaneously knocked out of his grasp and flew away. The last remaining golden light still struck his chest. A warmth spread across his chest, and the impact force sent him flying three *zhang* away. No blood spurted out. Nie Bing, familiar with the characteristics of his own skin, was now very grateful to Galamandis. If not for nearly a month of torment, he might have been disemboweled by now.\n\nAt the last moment of impact, the Light Dou Qi only sliced open his outermost garment and left a faint mark between his chest and abdomen.\n\nNie Bing was rejoicing, while Roamer was astonished. He hadn't expected that even using seventy percent of his strength, he still hadn't dealt with this bandit. His figure flashed, his agile form displaying a speed completely disproportionate to his build. In the next moment, he was already in front of Nie Bing, his battle blade pointing forward, aimed at Nie Bing's neck.\n\nJust as Nie Bing was about to resist, Roamer suddenly retreated three steps backward as if he had encountered a ghost. For the first time, a look of horror appeared in his eyes. His gaze fixed on Nie Bing's chest, his whole body motionless, and he did not launch another attack.\n\nNie Bing naturally didn't understand why the opponent had stopped. But it seemed he wouldn't let such an opportunity slip. He clasped his hands in front of his chest and swiftly unleashed a Tier 2 Ice-Fire Origin attack.\n\nWith danger upon him, Roamer reacted almost subconsciously. His battle blade waved, forming a golden-silver mingled screen of light, resisting the strange Ice-Fire Origin magic.\n\nNie Bing naturally didn't expect his attack to harm him. Using this opportunity, he hurriedly scrambled up from the ground and ran towards Galamandis. \"Great One, he's a Martial Saint! If you still want to eat delicious food, hurry and help!\"\n\nHis figure flashed, and Galamandis finally appeared. However, he blocked Nie Bing's path, raising a hand and tapping Nie Bing on the head. \"Idiot, idiot, what are you even good for?\"\n\nNie Bing said angrily, \"Didn't you see his Sacred Dou Qi? Is a Light Knight with Sacred Dou Qi someone I can deal with? He's definitely not an ordinary mercenary.\"\n\nGalamandis snorted and said, \"You idiot, why do you have so little confidence in yourself? If you hadn't talked so much nonsense from the start and directly unleashed the strongest magic you could use, he might not have been able to handle a Tier 7 Ice-Fire Origin magic. A mage facing a warrior yet letting them get close for combat—if you don't die, who will? You just know how to belittle yourself. Although it's Tier 7 magic, don't forget that Ice-Fire Origin can greatly increase your attack power. You had a complete chance to suppress him. Who can you blame when you yourself gave up the opportunity? I won't intervene. The struggles between you humans have nothing to do with me.\"\n\nNie Bing's heart sank with a cold sweat. Only then did he remember that Galamandis could not casually attack humans. But what to do now? From the look of Roamer's Dou Qi, he seemed to be at a similar level to Phoenix Girl, both seemingly having just entered the Martial Saint realm. It was just that he didn't have weapons as good as Phoenix Girl's, and his Sacred Dou Qi was also slightly inferior to Phoenix Girl's. But he was a mage! Even if Galamandis was right, would Roamer give him a chance to chant spells now?\n\nTurning around, Nie Bing, left with no choice, summoned the Dawn that Pierces the Heavens—the Holy Radiance Blade—from his spatial ring. He could only take things one step at a time now, secretly chanting the spell for blizzard. At least this way, he could run a bit faster. However, something surprising happened. Roamer did not pursue. He looked up at Nie Bing with a strange gaze. Suddenly, he turned around and walked towards his two companions, saying in a deep voice, \"Go get him one hundred purple gold coins.\" After speaking, he directly mounted his horse.\n\nNie Bing was stunned. Had he misheard? He told his subordinates to give him one hundred purple gold coins—that was the one thousand gold coins he had demanded earlier! He clearly held the upper hand, so why would he give him money? Could he have been intimidated by Galamandis? Impossible! Galamandis hadn't shown his strength.\n\nWhile Nie Bing was lost in wild thoughts, Roamer's two companions were equally puzzled. The one on the left said, \"Big brother, you're not mistaken, are you? Why give him money? One hundred purple gold coins is not a small sum.\"\n\nRoamer glared at him and said, \"I know what I'm doing. Go get it quickly. This money comes out of my own pocket.\"\n\nThe subordinate seemed to be very afraid of him, not daring to say anything more. He turned his horse around and galloped towards the caravan.\n\nRoamer looked up at Nie Bing, and a look of surprise appeared in his eyes once more, because he saw the Holy Radiance Blade, gleaming with golden light, in Nie Bing's hand. At this moment, Nie Bing wouldn't give much thought to why Roamer was doing this. He was busy picking up his Morning Dew Blade and Sun Blade.\n\n\"Little brother, come here,\" Roamer said gently to Nie Bing.",

    "title": "Chapter 71 The Function of Tianhua Card (Part 1)",
    "content": "Nian Bing held three blades. Since Liu Lang had not pursued him earlier, he wouldn't pose any threat now. He raised his head, looked at Liu Lang, and said, \"How do you know I'm younger than you?\"\n\nLiu Lang laughed heartily, saying, \"Your voice sounds fake the moment I hear it. It might fool ordinary people, but trying to fool me? It's not that easy. Come over when I tell you to; I won't harm you. This time, consider your robbery a success. To think I, Gilded Blade Liu Lang, this is the first time I've ever been successfully robbed in my life. Oh, I can't not give this face!\" As he spoke, his gaze fell on Nian Bing's chest again.\n\nNian Bing subconsciously looked down. Only then did he realize that after his chest clothing was damaged, the Tianhua Tablet hanging around his neck had been exposed. Its mutton-fat white jade(1) emitted a lustrous glow. His heart stirred, and he immediately understood something. Recovering his original voice, he asked somewhat strangely, \"You know the owner of this tablet?\"\n\nLiu Lang nodded, saying, \"This belongs to my sister-in-law. Kid, since you have(2) this tablet, you should recognize me, right? Why would you come to rob me? Tell me, what's your relationship with the owner of this tablet?\"\n\nNian Bing snorted, saying, \"Aren't you afraid I stole this tablet? Since I'm here to rob, I'm not a good person.\"\n\nLiu Lang chuckled(3), again revealing his large yellow buck teeth. \"What a joke, truly the funniest joke in the world. On this continent, there are probably very few who can snatch things from my sister-in-law. And you? You can't even beat me, what makes you think you can snatch things? Alright. Since you don't want to say, I won't ask further. Anyway, I'll give face to the owner of this tablet. At worst, I'll just have her pay me back when I get home.\"\n\nAt this moment, Liu Lang's subordinate had already ridden back. His horse-controlling skill was extremely refined. He came to Liu Lang's side and handed over a sizable leather satchel(4). Liu Lang didn't even look at it, directly tossing the satchel to Nian Bing. \"Take it and spend it. Don't be a bandit anymore; this isn't a good job. If you lose your life, your family will be sad for you.\"\n\nNian Bing received the satchel. A light continuously flickered in his eyes. The two words \"family\" made him recall his parents, and at the same time, the owner of this Tianhua Tablet. He had actually robbed a merchant caravan protected by Aunt Yu's friend. No, this won't do. How could he take this money? In his heart, Hu Ruyan, who gave him the Tianhua Tablet, was one of the people he respected most. Although Nian Bing had always been unconcerned with trifles(5), he cherished those who had shown him kindness(6).\n\nHe tossed the satchel back to Liu Lang. \"Since you know the owner of this tablet, I don't want the money anymore. You can go.\" Saying this, he turned and walked towards Galamandis.\n\nA figure flashed. Liu Lang, who had just taken the satchel and was somewhat surprised, only felt his hand lighten; the satchel was gone again(7). Galamandis weighed the leather satchel(8), chuckling, \"Not bad, not bad, quite a lot of money! Enough to eat for a while. Why would he not want what was given? If it's free, why not take it? And even if you take it, it's still free anyway. You don't want it, I do.\"\n\nNian Bing turned around and looked at Galamandis with complex eyes. Suddenly, as if he had decided something, he said resolutely, \"Galamandis, give the money back(9) to them. We can't take this money.\"\n\nGalamandis snorted, saying, \"When is it your turn to demand things from me? Just because you say we can't take it means we can't? I insist on taking it.\"\n\n\"Galamandis, give the money back to them(10). Even if I have to go beg on the streets, I will definitely make sure you're full.\" Although Nian Bing's expression was calm, his voice revealed an unprecedented aura(11). Galamandis's heart trembled slightly(12). It was the first time he had seen Nian Bing with such a serious expression(13), not even when he had threatened Nian Bing's life previously. He raised an eyebrow slightly, saying, \"Begging, how much money can you get from begging?\"\n\nNian Bing took a few steps to Galamandis's front, saying in a deep voice, \"Give it back to them. I can sell Chenlu, can't I?\"\n\nA great light of surprise erupted in Galamandis's eyes. Having interacted with Nian Bing for so long, he was very clear(14) that both Chenlu and Zhenyang were Nian Bing's most treasured possessions(15). Now, he was actually willing to sell Chenlu for a bit of money for outsiders, which showed how seriously he took this matter(16). Galamandis no longer insisted. He disdainfully tossed the money bag back to Liu Lang(17). \"Alright, if you want to be a good person, then be one. As long as I get to eat my fill, that's fine.\" Saying this, he walked straight down the main road without looking back.\n\nThe shock in Liu Lang's heart was immeasurable(18). First, he hadn't even clearly seen(19) what Galamandis did. If the other party wanted to take his life, at that speed, he wouldn't even have a chance to dodge(20). What kind of power was that(21)?! Perhaps even his elder brother couldn't achieve it. Could this red-haired young man be a Divine Master(22)?\n\nNian Bing bowed to Liu Lang, saying, \"I'm sorry, I didn't know you were Aunt Yu's(23) friend. Please forgive my offense just now. We'll meet again.\" After speaking, he chased after Galamandis. At this moment, he felt that he had done something he was most proud of. Even Galamandis was swayed by him. Aunt Yu, you won't blame me, will you? How are you now, are you well?\n\nThe caravan departed. Liu Lang did not pursue them further or ask more questions(24). He noticed a detail: all the caravan's horses were trembling slightly(25) as Nian Bing and Galamandis passed by, and only regained their ability to move after they had gone. He couldn't guess the origin of Nian Bing and Galamandis, but he now fully believed(26) that these two truly had the ability to rob(27) the merchant caravan he was protecting. Liu Lang bore an important mission. Although he was very curious about Nian Bing's background, now was not the time to ask too many questions. Everything could wait until after this mission was completed and he returned.\n\nAlthough Galamandis deliberately concealed his aura(28), horses are spiritual animals(29). The faint dragon aura on him was still perceived by the horses(30). Therefore, even though these steeds were well-trained, they were still intimidated by Galamandis's aura.\n\n\"Nian Bing, do you know those people just now?\" Galamandis finally spoke. After walking for half an hour, Nian Bing had remained silent. Being proud, he naturally endured not speaking, but in the end, it was he who could no longer bear the solitude first.\n\nNian Bing shook his head, saying, \"I don't know them, Galamandis. Do you remember, I once told you that when I first began cultivating the Ice-Fire Confluence, I was saved by this Tianhua Tablet. Without the Tianhua Tablet(31), I would probably have died long ago. And it would have been impossible to cultivate the Ice-Fire Confluence. But that Light Knight who fought me(32) just now recognized the owner of this tablet, so I really can't rob them. However, one thing I lied to you about(33): the Ice and Snow Goddess Stone on the Chenlu blade is the last thing my mother left me(34). I definitely won't sell it. But don't worry, I will absolutely make sure you're full. After we reach Olan City, I'll find a restaurant to work as a chef. Feeding you should be no problem(35).\"\n\nGalamandis suddenly put his arm around(36) Nian Bing's shoulder and chuckled, \"I knew you wouldn't be willing to sell it. Let's forget about it this time; as long as there's food to eat(37) then, it's fine. But, after not dealing with you humans for these(38) many years, I didn't expect you humans to have already become(39) so strong. What level of warrior would that guy just now be considered among you humans? Looking at his attire, he should be a very ordinary warrior, right?\"\n\nNian Bing glanced at Galamandis. He said, \"If he's considered an ordinary(40) warrior among humans, then perhaps the Divine Realm you speak of wouldn't be able to maintain its mystery for too long. There are probably no more than ten Light Knights of his level on the entire continent. That's power close to the Martial Saint realm(41). Although I don't know much about the martial arts world(42) of the continent, so far, Gilded Blade Liu Lang was the third Martial Saint I've seen(43). What kind of status do you think he holds(44) among human warriors?\"\n\nGalamandis chuckled, \"So, that means the merchant caravan he led just now must have been transporting a lot of good stuff, otherwise how could a Martial Saint be dispatched?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, saying, \"That's probably the case(45). Mercenary is not a noble(46) profession on the continent. Warriors with profound martial skills(47) generally don't join mercenary groups(48). He just called himself the Blade King Mercenary Group; I think(49) it's very likely a disguise(50). As for what they were transporting, I can't guess, but it must be very valuable.\"\n\nGalamandis turned his head and looked at the retreating figures of the caravan(51). \"What a pity, what a pity. I'll give you face this time. However, I still want to drink Ice-Fire Eight-Level Fresh. You know, I love eating fish the most.\"\n\n\"Alright, no problem. Once we reach Olan City, I'll definitely find a way to make sure you're full.\"\n\nAs they drew closer to Olan City, the former capital of the Olan Empire, the pedestrians on the main road gradually increased. Most of them were humble, simple poor people(52), disheveled and gaunt. No need to ask; this was surely the result of war(53). As long as there was war(54), the most unfortunate ones were naturally the common people.\n\n\"Nian Bing, I'm hungry.\" Galamandis, like a child, leaned close to Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing smiled wryly, \"Then just eat me. Didn't you say you wouldn't have a problem not eating for several months normally? I think you're not hungry, but craving.\"\n\nGalamandis chuckled, \"You know me so well! Anyway, as long as you solve my problem. Hmm, how about this, I'll catch some wild beasts for you, and you roast them for me to eat.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head, saying, \"No, don't. We should reach Olan soon. Let's settle down(55) there first, then eat. Just bear with it for a while.\"\n\n\"Endure? I've already endured(56) for three days! You're lucky; you just eat some dry rations every day and that's it. But what about me? I haven't even had a bite of anything edible. Olan City, right? We're going now.\" Familiar yet incomprehensible incantations sounded around Nian Bing. Galamandis completely disregarded the many(57) ordinary people nearby. Wrapped in silver light, his and Nian Bing's bodies flashed and disappeared.\n\n\"This direction is correct, right?\" Galamandis's voice sounded in Nian Bing's ear.\n\nNian Bing discovered that he was now in a strange space, surrounded by a silvery expanse. He couldn't see anything clearly(58). \"How would I know? I can't even see clearly right now.\"\n\nGalamandis chuckled, \"It should be correct, but I haven't used space magic in so long, it's a bit rusty(59). I hope we didn't go to the wrong place.\"\n\nA silver light flashed, and the surrounding scenery appeared. Nian Bing was surprised to see(60) that there was nothing around his body except Galamandis. He subconsciously looked down, froze for a moment, and the next instant, a strong sensation of weightlessness spread throughout his body.\n\nBang! He fell heavily onto the ground, startling the surrounding pedestrians, who scattered and dodged, one by one watching him with astonished gazes.\n\nAfter falling heavily, his whole body felt as if it were falling apart. Nian Bing jumped up from the ground and cursed loudly, \"Galamandis, you scoundrel, what kind of lousy magic is this?!\"\n\nThe silver light once again enveloped Nian Bing's body. Under the astonished gaze of the surrounding crowd, he disappeared(61) into thin air. When he reappeared, he was already in an uninhabited corner(62).\n\nGalamandis appeared before him, chuckling, \"My bad, a mistake, a blunder(63). I forgot you can't fly, so I teleported us into the sky. Luckily, a height of ten zhang won't kill you if you fall. If it were a hundred zhang, then it would be hard to say.\" It turned out that when Nian Bing had previously discovered there was nothing around him, he was suspended in mid-air. Once the spatial magic power dissipated(64), his body naturally plummeted. However, even he himself was surprised that after falling ten zhang from the sky onto the ground, aside from some aches all over his body, nothing major happened(65). Was this still a human body?\n\n\"Serves you right! Who told you not to let me eat delicious food for days? This is still light; next time, it'll be a bit higher. This should be Olan City(66) that you mentioned. Now, you figure out how to get me something to eat.\"\n\nNian Bing composed himself and looked around(67). Indeed, this was clearly a city(68). The architectural style of the city was distinctly different(69) from that of the Ice Moon Empire. Most buildings in the Ice Dan Empire had pointed roofs, while here, tall buildings were rare(70); most were single-story houses. Peeking out from a corner, although there were many pedestrians on the road, equally alarming was the number of beggars(71). Almost every three or four zhang, there would be one or two beggars(72) sitting on the ground, begging. Was this the capital of the Olan Empire? How could it have fallen to such a state(73)?\n\nHow could Nian Bing know that among the five great empires of the Yangguang Continent, the Olan Empire was surrounded by the other four great empires? Besides its good relations with the Ice Dan Empire, the Langmu Empire, Huarong Empire, and Qiru Empire bordering it all eyed it covetously(74), viewing the Olan Empire as the best piece of fat meat. It was only due to the mutual restraint among the great empires, coupled with the Ice Moon Empire's inclination(75) towards the Olan Empire, that the Olan Empire was able to avoid destruction. However, its surrounding territory had already significantly decreased(76) compared to its original size.\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n(1) The original text has \"羊脂白it\" (yáng zhī bái it), which is likely a typo for \"羊脂白玉\" (yáng zhī bái yù), meaning \"mutton-fat white jade.\"\n(2) The original text has \"你既然哼這塊牌子\" (nǐ jì rán hēng zhè kuài pái zi), literally \"since you hum this tablet.\" \"哼\" (hēng) is likely a typo for \"有\" (yǒu), meaning \"have.\"\n(3) The original text has \"流浪給給一笑\" (liú làng gěi gěi yī xiào), which is an unusual phrasing, possibly an onomatopoeia for a chuckle.\n(4) The original text has \"一個不小的皮裳\" (yī gè bù xiǎo de pí shang), literally \"a sizable leather garment.\" \"皮裳\" (pí shang) is likely a typo for \"皮囊\" (pí náng), meaning \"leather satchel\" or \"leather pouch,\" which is used correctly later in the same sentence.\n(5) The original text has \"不狗小節\" (bù gǒu xiǎo jié), literally \"not dog small details.\" This is an idiom meaning \"unconcerned with trifles\" or \"not sticking to minor rules.\"\n(6) The original text has \"對自己哼恩的人\" (duì zì jǐ hēng ēn de rén), literally \"those who hum grace to him.\" \"哼\" (hēng) is likely a typo for \"有\" (yǒu), meaning \"have\" or \"show.\"\n(7) The original text has \"皮囊又沾失了\" (pí náng yòu zhān shī le), literally \"the satchel stuck and lost again.\" \"沾失\" (zhān shī) is likely a typo for \"消失\" (xiāo shī), meaning \"disappeared.\"\n(8) The original text has \"加拉曼迪斯掂著皮素\" (jiā lā màn dí sī diān zhe pí sù), literally \"Galamandis weighed the leather simplicity.\" \"皮素\" (pí sù) is likely a typo for \"皮囊\" (pí náng), meaning \"leather satchel.\"\n(9) The original text has \"你耙錢還給他們\" (nǐ pá qián huán gěi tā men), literally \"you rake money back to them.\" \"耙\" (pá) is likely a typo for \"把\" (bǎ), a grammatical particle indicating disposal, so \"give the money back.\"\n(10) The original text has \"把錢還拾他們\" (bǎ qián huán shí tā men), literally \"give the money back and pick them up.\" \"拾\" (shí) is likely a typo for \"給\" (gěi), meaning \"to give.\"\n(11) The original text has \"前所未唁的氣勢\" (qián suǒ wèi yàn de qì shì), literally \"unprecedented and unspoken aura.\" \"唁\" (yàn) meaning \"to condole\" is likely a typo for a character that signifies something unseen or unheard, implying an \"unprecedented aura.\"\n(12) The original text has \"心中徽震\" (xīn zhōng huī zhèn), literally \"heart insignia trembled.\" \"徽\" (huī) is likely a typo for \"微\" (wēi), meaning \"slight.\"\n(13) The original text has \"著到念冰哼如此認真的神情\" (zhe dào niàn bīng hēng rú cǐ rèn zhēn de shén qíng), with \"著到\" (zhe dào) likely a typo for \"看到\" (kàn dào) meaning \"to see,\" and \"哼\" (hēng) likely a typo for \"有\" (yǒu) meaning \"to have.\"\n(14) The original text has \"他很請楚\" (tā hěn qǐng chǔ), literally \"he very please clear.\" \"請\" (qǐng) is likely a typo for \"清\" (qīng), meaning \"clear.\"\n(15) The original text has \"念冰最寶貝地東西\" (niàn bīng zuì bǎo bèi dì dōng xi), literally \"Nian Bing most treasured ground things.\" \"地\" (dì) is likely a typo for \"的\" (de), a possessive particle.\n(16) The original text has \"他對此事地重視了\" (tā duì cǐ shì dì zhòng shì le), literally \"he on this matter ground importance.\" \"地\" (dì) is likely a typo for \"的\" (de), a possessive particle.\n(17) The original text has \"拋回拾諒浪\" (pāo huí shí liàng làng), literally \"tossed back picked up forgiven wave.\" This is a phonetic or character-based typo for \"拋回給流浪\" (pāo huí gěi liú làng), meaning \"tossed back to Liu Lang.\"\n(18) The original text has \"震撼走無以附加的\" (zhèn hàn zǒu wú yǐ fù jiā de), literally \"shock walk unsurpassed.\" \"走\" (zǒu) is likely a typo for \"是\" (shì), meaning \"is\" or \"was.\"\n(19) The original text has \"先拆他根本沒嗜看請楚\" (xiān chāi tā gēn běn méi shì kàn qǐng chǔ), with several typos. \"先拆\" (xiān chāi) literally \"first dismantle,\" \"沒嗜\" (méi shì) literally \"didn't addicted to,\" and \"請楚\" (qǐng chǔ) literally \"please clear.\" It likely means \"he hadn't even clearly seen.\"\n(20) The original text has \"躲閃地機會都沒塔\" (duǒ shǎn dì jī huì dōu méi tǎ), literally \"dodging ground chance didn't pagoda.\" \"地\" (dì) is likely a typo for \"的\" (de), and \"塔\" (tǎ) is likely a phonetic typo for \"有\" (yǒu), meaning \"have.\"\n(21) The original text has \"這走什麼樣的力量啊！\" (zhè zǒu shén me yàng de lì liàng a!), literally \"this walk what kind of power!\" \"走\" (zǒu) is likely a typo for \"是\" (shì), meaning \"is.\"\n(22) The original text has \"紅年輕人走神師不成？\" (hóng nián qīng rén zǒu shén shī bù chéng?), literally \"red young man walk divine master not make?\" \"走\" (zǒu) is likely a typo for \"是\" (shì), meaning \"is.\"\n(23) The original text has \"玉1阿姨\" (yù 1 āyí), with a stray number \"1\".

    "title": "Chapter 71 The Effect of Tianhua Card (Part 2)",
    "content": "For years, the Aolan Empire had been constantly harassed by the Three Great Empires, forcing it to dedicate most of its energy to warfare. The vast resources produced by the empire were also used for this purpose, which led to the slow development of the Aolan Empire itself. Not only could it not compare with powerful nations like Huarong, but even the Bingyue Empire was much stronger than it. Therefore, the Aolan Empire's wealth was divided by region: the closer one got to the Bingyue Empire, the more prosperous it was; the closer to the southern regions near the Huarong and Qiru Empires, the more barren. Aolan City was located in the center of the empire, and its conditions were even inferior to those of Wulan City, though its total area was considerably larger.\n\n\"What's there to eat? What's good? Hurry up and take me there!\" Garamandis was not a dragon who liked to wait.\n\n\"Fine, eat, eat yourself to death then. I still have a dozen or so gold coins that wanderer gave me, enough for a few meals for you. Let's go, let's find a restaurant.\" The two walked out from around the corner. Nianbing ascertained the direction and led Garamandis towards the center of Aolan City, figuring there had to be a place to eat there.\n\nThe closer they got to the center of Aolan City, the fewer beggars there were. Shops lined the streets, and although they weren't large, there was a semblance of prosperity.\n\nNot long after walking, Nianbing finally saw a restaurant. Before Nianbing could say a word, Garamandis had already quickened his pace towards it. The restaurant looked ordinary from the outside, with no one even at the entrance to greet them. The two entered. It was nearly noon, and about seventy percent of the tables inside were occupied. Nianbing pulled Garamandis to a table near the window. Garamandis had always been most interested in human restaurants; he looked left and right, especially at the food on other tables, and was practically drooling like a dragon.\n\n\"Gentlemen, what would you like to eat?\" A waiter walked over, asking politely.\n\nNianbing and Garamandis appeared to be of similar age on the surface. Though their temperaments differed, both had handsome appearances. Garamandis exuded a faint, almost imperceptible, domineering aura. Nianbing, though dressed plainly due to his magic cultivation, emanated a lofty aura.\n\nGaramandis said unceremoniously, \"Just bring out whatever's good, enough for ten people.\"\n\n\"Ten portions?\" The waiter looked at him with some surprise.\n\nGaramandis said impatiently, \"I told you to serve it, so serve it. Hurry up. Are you afraid we won't pay?\"\n\nThe waiter nodded and quickly left.\n\nNianbing whispered, \"Great Garamandis, when you eat later, try to be a little more refined.\" He had a deep understanding of Garamandis's eating habits. Before coming here, they had once dined in a small city's restaurant, and Garamandis's almost frenzied eating had scared quite a few people.\n\n\"What's 'refined'? Let's eat our fill first.\" Garamandis wouldn't give Nianbing the time of day.\n\nNianbing was helpless. He truly wanted to tell everyone that he didn't know this big eater in front of him, but his life seemed more important. Bear it, he could only bear it. He said nothing more and turned his attention to the side. Just then, the customers at the table closest to them were talking loudly, and Nianbing could hear them clearly.\n\n\"Did you hear? Grand Duke Lanyu has returned with his troops.\"\n\n\"Grand Duke Lanyu is back? Doesn't he need to defend anymore? What if Huarong and Qiru attack again without him leading the legion?\"\n\nHearing these two sentences, Nianbing couldn't help but perk up. Wasn't the destination of the problematic letter Luorou entrusted to him the Lanyu Duke's Mansion?\n\n\"Of course, he doesn't need to defend anymore. It's said that this matter has finally been resolved with the mediation of the Bingyue Empire. The Huarong Empire and the Qiru Empire have both promised not to invade our country for three years. Of course, our Aolan also paid a considerable price. Huarong and Qiru are simply a tiger and a wolf. Who knows how many more resources they've plundered from our country this time.\"\n\n\"Sigh, I knew the final outcome would be like this. Either cede land or pay indemnities. Our Aolan is almost finished.\"\n\n\"Shh, keep your voice down. It wouldn't be good if the officers heard you. Alas, our Aolan Empire is still supported by Grand Duke Lanyu. If not for the Silver Feather Knights he led, fighting desperately, Huarong and Qiru would have already invaded. It's getting hard to make a living here. If things don't work out, we'll just collectively migrate there, closer to the Bingyue Empire. The Bingyue Empire surely wouldn't stand by and watch our Aolan be annihilated. If the Huarong Empire becomes any stronger, the entire continent's situation might change.\"\n\n\"You can't say that either. I don't think the Bingyue Empire has good intentions either. If they just invited that Ice Snow Goddess Priestess to help, how could the Huarong Empire dare to be so arrogant? Our Aolan Empire has too few powerful mages, so we're always taken advantage of and oppressed. The Huarong and Qiru Empires have already occupied so much land and are still constantly expanding. What wolfish ambitions! Actually, if our Aolan were ruled by Grand Duke Lanyu, maybe the current situation could change? Unfortunately, Grand Duke Lanyu is too loyal to the royal family. That's almost impossible.\"\n\n\"Let's not talk about these things. Politics has nothing to do with us commoners. Drink, drink!\"\n\nThe conversation temporarily stopped, and the guests at that table continued to eat and drink. From their words, it was not difficult to discern Grand Duke Lanyu's status in the Aolan Empire. Nianbing thought to himself, *Luorou, oh Luorou, you're still hoping Grand Duke Lanyu's daughter will help you, but the Aolan Empire can barely fend for itself now.* *Never mind, no matter what, what I promised doesn't necessarily have to be fully achieved; just delivering the letter counts as completing the mission.* However, listening to what those few people said just now, this Grand Duke Lanyu was the commander of the entire Silver Feather Knights. Wasn't Aunt Yuruyan protected by the Silver Feather Knights back then? Perhaps this Grand Duke even knows Aunt Yuruyan. If he could meet Aunt Yuruyan through him, that would be great. So many years had passed, he wondered how Aunt Yuruyan was doing now.\n\nRecalling Aunt Yuruyan's kind smile, Nianbing's heart involuntarily warmed. He stood up and walked to that table of guests, addressing a man in a white robe, \"Elder brother, could I trouble you for a moment?\"\n\nThe man in white was drinking wine. Hearing Nianbing's voice, he couldn't help but look up. Nianbing's handsome appearance easily garnered goodwill, and his tone was sincere and polite. The man in white said, \"Young brother, what do you want to ask? From your accent, you must be from out of town.\"\n\nNianbing nodded and said, \"I'm from the Bingyue Empire. Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to Grand Duke Lanyu's mansion?\"\n\nThe man in white was clearly surprised, sizing Nianbing up a few times. He said, \"You want to find Grand Duke Lanyu? Young brother, I think you want to join the army, but you should go to the Military Department then. Grand Duke Lanyu isn't someone just anyone can meet.\"\n\nNianbing feigned an expression of reverence and said, \"Grand Duke Lanyu has always been my idol and the person I respect most. I just want to know where his mansion is. Maybe if I wait outside his gate, I can meet him when he comes out.\"\n\nUpon hearing Nianbing say this, the man in white's expression immediately softened. He nodded approvingly and said, \"That's good. Grand Duke Lanyu can be said to be the protector god of our Aolan Empire! Without him, the Aolan Empire wouldn't even be able to maintain its current state. There are many young people with thoughts like yours nowadays, but whether you can meet the Grand Duke depends on your luck. The Duke's mansion is in the south of the city, in Aolan City. Besides the Imperial Palace, Grand Duke Lanyu's mansion covers the largest area. You can find it easily just by asking anyone in the south of the city.\"\n\nNianbing smiled slightly. \"Thank you for the directions.\" With that, he returned to his seat.\n\n\"Nianbing, you didn't bring me to Aolan City just to eat good food, did you, kid?\" Garamandis's discontented voice rang out.\n\nNianbing smiled. \"Of course I did, why wouldn't I? But, I have a little personal business on the side; a friend asked me to deliver a letter. Don't worry, it won't take too much time.\"\n\n\"Sending a letter! Well, that's fine, but remember, you have my magic brand on you. Running away is impossible.\" Garamandis's pupils suddenly turned red, looking at Nianbing meaningfully, as if saying, *Kid, I've got you now.*\n\nNianbing shook his head helplessly, lowering his voice. \"It's my honor to be with the great Garamandis, why would I run? Don't worry. After we eat, we'll find a place to stay, and I'll deliver the letter this afternoon. If you don't like it here, we'll head towards the Huarong Empire tomorrow. The Huarong Empire is the most powerful and prosperous empire on the Yangguang Continent. There will naturally be no shortage of good food there.\"\n\nAn hour later, Nianbing, with a bitter expression, walked out of the restaurant with Garamandis.\n\n\"Pah, pah, pah, what kind of lousy restaurant is this? The food tastes awful! Nianbing! Your cooking is still the best, much better than theirs.\" Garamandis was extremely dissatisfied with the restaurant's food.\n\n\"Boss, you can keep cursing, but you didn't eat any less just now, and you ate all the most expensive dishes too. We only have two gold coins left, which is probably just enough for lodging. It looks like I really need to find a job to support you.\"\n\nGaramandis said as a matter of course, \"Even if it tastes a bit bad, I still need to eat my fill. You can find a job if you want, as long as there's good food, it doesn't matter to me where we stay.\"\n\nHearing him say that, Nianbing wasn't angry but rather pleased. He lowered his head, a glint in his eyes that Garamandis couldn't detect. The word 'utilize' kept circling in Nianbing's mind.\n\nAlthough Garamandis had high demands for food, he had no particular preference for lodging; he just needed a bed to sleep on. Eating his fill and then sleeping was always his favorite thing to do. The two found the cheapest inn to settle down. While Garamandis slept, Nianbing used one of his two gold coins to buy ten of the cheapest white scrolls at a magic shop.\n\nSelling scrolls was probably the fastest way to earn money. With Garamandis's eating habits, few people could afford to keep him fed.\n\nThe advancement in Ice and Fire Coexistence had also greatly improved Nianbing's mastery of magic arrays. Although the success rate of making magic scrolls from white scrolls was lower, making some ordinary Tier 4 trigger scrolls was not difficult for him. This Aolan City was really poor. For now, he would just sell a few to get some money, enough to live on.\n\nIt only took Nianbing an hour to make a few scrolls. Besides one that failed due to carelessness, he successfully created nine Tier 4 trigger scrolls. Garamandis's dragon snore was quite loud. Nianbing glanced at him, then quietly slipped out of the room and headed towards the south of Aolan City, following the directions he had gotten.\n\nSelling scrolls wasn't urgent; he'd deliver the letter first. Just as the man in white at the restaurant had said, finding Grand Duke Lanyu's mansion in Aolan City was no challenge. After Nianbing reached the south of the city, he only had to ask one person to find his destination. Across two streets, he could already see the red courtyard wall, two *zhang* tall. Grand Duke Lanyu's mansion covered an enormous area. The two-zhang-tall vermilion courtyard wall was like a city wall. At the main gate, sixteen Silver Feather Knights, clad in silver light armor, stood neatly in two rows. The plumes on their helmets were azure. Each had a hand resting on their knight's sword. Although they looked straight ahead, Nianbing could clearly feel that they were constantly observing their surroundings. At the slightest disturbance, these Silver Feather Knights could react immediately.\n\nSixteen low-ranking Silver Feather Knights, that's sixteen Sword Master-level martial artists! Who said the Aolan Empire was weak? Just this Silver Feather Knight order of ten thousand men could probably only be rivaled by the Huarong Empire's Flame Lion Knights. No wonder those commoners said Grand Duke Lanyu was the protector god of the Aolan Empire. The Silver Feather Knights could definitely be compared to an ordinary army of two hundred thousand!\n\nInside the Grand Duke's Mansion.\n\nA handsome middle-aged man, around forty years old, sat behind his desk in the study, his brows tightly furrowed, seemingly troubled by something. Although he was seated, he inadvertently exuded a strong, agile, and lethal aura. His eyes flickered with divine light, and his black robe could not hide his imposing physique. His hands, resting on the desk, were quite distinctive: broad palms and long, slender fingers. Though his knuckles were not prominent, from their appearance alone, one could tell they were certainly a powerful pair of hands.\n\nOutside the door, someone entered, and a soft and pleasant voice rang out, \"You're back. What did His Majesty say today?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man looked up. The person who entered was a woman, appearing to be twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, dressed in a pale blue gown. Beautiful patterns were embroidered on the gown with silver thread. She had willow-like eyebrows and a jade-like nose, her skin was like congealed fat. Her long, dark green hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall, tied with a silver ring. Her blue eyes were clear to the bottom, and her beautiful face showed a mix of concern and worry. If Nianbing saw her, he might not immediately recognize her, but she was precisely Yuruyan, who had given him the Tianhua token back then. Eight years had passed, but her appearance had not changed in the slightest.",

    "title": "Chapter 72 See Yu Ru Fuchs again (Part 1)",
    "content": "\"Ruyan, come.\" When the middle-aged man saw Yu Ruyan, his tightly furrowed brows immediately relaxed, a gentle smile appeared on his face, and the deep love in his eyes was so clear. Reaching out, he embraced his beloved wife, letting her sit on his lap, and as he breathed in her familiar and wonderful fragrance, the middle-aged man's heart calmed significantly.\n\n\"What's wrong? You look troubled! Did His Highness not approve your military expenditure request?\" Yu Ruyan's eyes showed a hint of worry.\n\nThe middle-aged man shook his head, saying, \"How could that be? When it comes to the military, His Highness never has any objections to my proposals. However, what good is it if the military funds are approved? Most of the southern regions of the entire empire are currently in famine. If this continues, major changes are bound to occur. As the saying goes, 'When the people are rich, the country is rich.' It's not enough for the empire to just have me. In such a vast Oland, there isn't even one person who can help His Majesty govern the empire. You also know that those petty individuals in court only know how to fawn and flatter. If this goes on, the nation will cease to be a nation!\"\n\nYu Ruyan sighed softly, saying, \"Forget it, Lan Yu. Even if you worry more, it's useless. The empire's problems weren't formed in a day or two. You need to take care of your health; don't overwork yourself.\"\n\nLan Yu took a deep breath, saying, \"I want to rest too, but can I? In this battle, the Silver Feather Knights lost three thousand warriors who will never see their families again. The entire knight order only has about ten thousand men. If the Huarong Empire decides to send their Flame Lion Knights, I'm afraid I won't be able to resist. Although the Ice Moon Empire is friendly with our country, they won't sincerely help us. In the long run, if our country can't undergo some fundamental changes, I'm afraid...\"\n\nYu Ruyan put her arms around her husband's neck, saying, \"Alright, don't talk about these things anymore. Be a bit happier. Oh, that's right, it hasn't all been bad news recently. The Silver Feather Reserve Corps I'm in charge of now has five thousand members, and two thousand of them are capable of going to battle. Although their strength can't compare to your warriors who have endured countless trials of iron and blood, I believe that with more training, we can definitely make up for this loss. Actually, the empire is not lacking in insightful individuals. A young brother and sister arrived a few days ago; the brother is a master-level Martial Artist. I think he can directly join the Knights.\"\n\nLan Yu smiled slightly, saying, \"Of course I'm at ease with how you handle things. Never mind, let's not talk about this anymore. I've only been back for a few days and haven't properly spent time with you.\"\n\nJust as Yu Ruyan was about to say something, a respectful voice suddenly came from outside, \"Report.\"\n\nYu Ruyan frowned, saying, \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Reporting to Madam, a young man has come from outside the mansion, saying he wishes to see the young lady.\"\n\nYu Ruyan and Lan Yu couldn't help but look at each other in surprise. Yu Ruyan said, \"Looking for Chenchen? What does this young man look like?\"\n\n\"A very handsome young man. He's holding the young lady's token and says he's here to deliver a letter to her.\"\n\nYu Ruyan stood up from Lan Yu's lap, saying, \"Bring him in. Have him meet the Duke and me here.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nNian Bing stood at the entrance of the Duke's Mansion, with sixteen Silver Feather Knights, thirty-two eyes, staring at him. The feeling was uncomfortable. He had already shown the bead Luo Rou gave him, but the knights hadn't let him in. Instead, they had reported to the mansion and sent someone to relay the message.\n\nThe massive vermilion mansion gate opened, and a servant in a green robe walked out, glanced at Nian Bing, and said, \"Please follow me.\"\n\nNian Bing breathed a sigh of relief. As long as he could get in and deliver the letter, his mission would be complete. At once, under the watchful eyes of the sixteen Silver Feather Knights guarding the entrance, he followed the servant into the Grand Duke's residence.\n\nUpon entering the main gate, Nian Bing first saw a spacious plaza. More accurately, it seemed to be a training ground, covering about two thousand square meters. In the center, over a dozen people were sparring, and neatly arranged weapon racks stood beside the training ground. Battle Qi crisscrossed the area, and from the solidness of their Battle Qi, they appeared to be at least Great Swordsmen or above. As expected, it was indeed the foremost military family in the Oland Empire! Although the attack methods used by these warriors were simple, their momentum was extremely formidable, and the combat techniques they employed were most suitable for the battlefield.\n\nThe Duke's Mansion was vast, winding and turning like a maze. The green-robed servant's face was calm; he didn't say a single word to Nian Bing, merely leading the way. After passing through three courtyards, the green-robed servant stopped in front of a row of houses and said to Nian Bing, \"Please wait a moment.\" After that, he turned to the door and announced, \"Reporting to His Grace the Duke, the person has been brought.\"\n\nA low and resonant voice sounded, \"Let him in.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The green-robed servant responded, stepped aside from the doorway, and gestured for Nian Bing to enter.\n\nNian Bing didn't stand on ceremony. He pushed open the door, and as he took his first step, even before fully entering the room, he immediately spotted Yu Ruyan standing by the writing desk.\n\nA rush of warmth surged through him. Nian Bing's previously calm eyes instantly filled with emotion. He took a few steps towards Yu Ruyan, his body trembling slightly.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing quickly approaching her, Yu Ruyan couldn't help but feel a hint of wariness. A cold glint flashed in her eyes as she lightly commanded, \"Stop.\" Nearly eight years had passed; she hadn't changed much, but Nian Bing had changed a great deal. Eight years ago, Nian Bing was just a child, but eight years later, he had become a handsome young man. With the change in his physique, how could Yu Ruyan recognize him after eight years?\n\n\"Auntie, don't you recognize me?\" Nian Bing knelt on one knee, respectfully saluting Yu Ruyan. His voice was already trembling, and tears flowed down his cheeks. He had never imagined that as soon as he arrived at this Duke's Mansion, he would see the aunt he had longed for.\n\nYu Ruyan exchanged a glance with Lan Yu, then turned back to look at Nian Bing. Nian Bing's handsome appearance gave her a hint of familiarity. She hesitated, \"You are?\"\n\n\"Mama, I used to call you Mama!\" As he spoke, Nian Bing pulled open the front of his shirt and took out the Huatian Token.\n\nYu Ruyan's entire body trembled, and her eyes widened in astonishment. She stepped forward and pulled Nian Bing up. Nian Bing was now more than half a head taller than her. She carefully observed the handsome young man, saying in surprise, \"Are you that little chubby boy from the Ice Moon Empire more than seven years ago? You, you're called...\"\n\n\"I'm Nian Bing! Auntie. You haven't changed at all; you're still so beautiful.\" Nian Bing took Yu Ruyan's hand, his voice full of emotion.\n\nFor any man other than her husband, the only outcome of trying to touch her would be death. Yet, at this moment, with Nian Bing holding her hand, Yu Ruyan felt only maternal affection in her heart, not the slightest sense of desecration. The pure innocence in Nian Bing's eyes deeply touched her.\n\nA cough sounded. If Duke Lan Yu had any flaw, it would probably be jealousy. After all, he had such a beautiful wife; who wouldn't prevent other men from getting close to their spouse? Even though the handsome young man in front of him was probably less than half his wife's age, Duke Lan Yu still felt a touch of envy. \"Ruyan, aren't you going to introduce me?\"\n\nOnly then did Nian Bing notice there was someone else sitting nearby. Duke Lan Yu stood up; he was about the same height as Nian Bing. From his presence, Nian Bing immediately made a judgment, and the emotion in his eyes subsided somewhat. He said respectfully, \"You must be His Grace Duke Lan Yu. Hello, I am Nian Bing.\"\n\nYu Ruyan proactively took Nian Bing's hand and said, \"Lan Yu, do you remember more than seven years ago, when I gave away the Huatian Token on my way back after taking Chenchen to meet her teacher? This is Nian Bing! I really didn't expect that after more than seven years, Nian Bing would find his way here on his own. Back then, he called me 'Mama' the moment he saw me. Who knew he'd grow up so much and become such a handsome young man.\"\n\nLan Yu suddenly understood, \"He's that little chubby boy you mentioned? Nian Bing, since you're here to see Ruyan, why do you have Chenchen's token?\"\n\nNian Bing wiped away his tears and smiled, \"I had no idea Auntie was here. I was entrusted by a friend to deliver a letter to your daughter. You and Auntie Yu are...\"\n\nYu Ruyan smiled slightly, \"Silly boy, he's my husband! The Duke's daughter you wish to see is our daughter! Didn't you meet Chenchen back then too?\"\n\nNian Bing finally understood, and he couldn't help but secretly praise Duke Lan Yu for his good fortune. \"So that's how it is! Auntie, is Miss Chenchen here? This letter was entrusted to me by a friend to give to her.\" A faint silver glow emanated from the Space Ring on his hand, and the letter Luo Rou had given him earlier appeared out of thin air.\n\nYu Ruyan took the letter and said in surprise, \"Nian Bing, are you a magician?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and nodded, \"Yes!\"\n\nYu Ruyan didn't open the letter. She smiled faintly, \"That's great! Our Oland Empire is really short on magicians. Is your teacher the old man from back then? But I didn't sense any magic power fluctuations from him! Chenchen isn't here; she's gone to study with her teacher and might not return even once a year. I'll give her this letter when she comes back this year.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"That's not the teacher who taught me magic. Auntie, this letter is quite urgent; it concerns my friend's lifelong happiness, so the sooner it's resolved, the better.\"\n\nYu Ruyan frowned slightly, saying, \"But this letter is for Chenchen, and I shouldn't open it. Who asked you to deliver the letter?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"It's Luo Rou, the daughter of Ice and Snow City's finance officer, known as the 'Wise Maiden'.\"\n\nYu Ruyan suddenly realized, \"Oh, that girl! I haven't seen her for several years either. Chenchen met Luo Rou the same year I met you. When we passed through Ice and Snow City, we were treated hospitably by Ice and Snow City, and Chenchen and Rou Rou became good sisters, hitting it off right away and even exchanging tokens. Do you know what this matter of Rou Rou's is about?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, saying, \"Luo Rou told me that she was because...\" At once, he described in detail everything Luo Rou had told him previously.\n\nAfter hearing Nian Bing's explanation, Yu Ruyan smiled faintly, \"Since that's the case, I understand Rou Rou's intention.\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu said, \"Currently, our Oland Empire faces internal troubles and external threats. Your aunt and I are both extremely busy. This Miss Luo Rou is also involved in a marriage alliance with the Ice Moon Empire's royal family, which makes things rather difficult! Our energy is limited, after all.\" He was speaking the truth; he was already too busy with state affairs, so how could he attend to such private matters?\n\nNian Bing had already anticipated Duke Lan Yu's reply and didn't take it to heart. After all, he was just delivering a letter. Although he had some fondness for Luo Rou, she was merely an ordinary friend. He believed that with Luo Rou's wisdom, she would certainly not compromise so easily, even without the help of Duke Lan Yu's family.\n\nJust then, Yu Ruyan suddenly smiled, looking at Lan Yu and saying, \"This letter couldn't have come at a better time. The problem you just mentioned can be completely resolved with this letter.\"\n\nLan Yu's heart stirred. He was skilled in warfare; few on the entire continent could compare to him in that regard. However, when it came to wisdom, he had always greatly admired his wife. \"Ruyan, do you mean...?\"\n\nYu Ruyan smiled slightly, \"Yu Ge, have you forgotten about that girl Rou Rou whom I mentioned to you? When she and our daughter first met, she was already quite famous in Ice and Snow City, known for her wisdom. To some extent, her father's current status is mostly thanks to her efforts. That girl's intelligence far surpasses mine, especially when it comes to handling various affairs; she's truly an expert. Although her father is far less capable, he also has good insights into financial matters and is a decent person.\"\n\nWith his wife's hint, Lan Yu immediately understood and said joyfully, \"If we secretly bring them to our Oland, change their names, and use them for my purposes...\"\n\nYu Ruyan smiled faintly, \"It's good that you understand. What you need to do is convince His Majesty to heavily employ Rou'er. Although I've rarely been to the Ice Moon Empire over the years, I'm still very familiar with Rou'er's situation. I can guarantee that if she assists His Majesty in managing the empire's various affairs, it won't be long before the empire presents a completely new appearance. Who says women are inferior to men? We can't let go of a talent like Rou'er; this is truly a good opportunity. In fact, Rou Rou probably sent Nian Bing with this letter for this very reason. That girl is very clever; since she doesn't want to marry the Ice Moon Prince, she'll naturally find a good way out for herself. Their family isn't flourishing; it's just the father and daughter, so the problem isn't difficult to solve. If worst comes to worst, I'll go myself. Nian Bing, don't worry, Auntie will handle this matter.\"\n\nNian Bing didn't understand politics, but he was very smart. From the conversation between Yu Ruyan and her husband, he had already caught some hints, and he couldn't help but secretly praise Auntie Yu Ruyan for her far-sightedness.",

    "content": "Luo Rou's reputation as a \"Wise Woman\" was by no means easily earned. If she were a man, she would likely have long been greatly valued by the Ice Moon Empire. And if Duke Lan Yu could bring Luo Rou to the Olan Empire, as long as her gender didn't lead to her being underestimated, improving Olan Empire's current situation would not be impossible. After all, for the Olan Empire, talent was the most important thing.\n\n\"Auntie, then I'll entrust this matter to you,\" Nian Bing said respectfully.\n\nYu Ru Yan smoothed her ink-green long hair, her posture graceful and serene. \"Nian Bing, you've come all this way to deliver a letter for a friend; why don't you stay with us for a while? Oh, that's right, you still haven't told me who your magic teacher is.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"My teacher is Archmage Long Zhi of the Ice Moon Empire's Mages' Guild.\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu said, \"So it's Long Zhi! I know him; his magical prowess is exceptionally high. It's a pity that with the Ice and Snow Divine Tower, the Ice Moon Empire doesn't value the Guild much. Since you are his disciple, your magical skill must not be weak. Nian Bing, do you have any other family in the Ice Moon Empire?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart trembled. After a moment, he shook his head and said, \"I no longer have any family.\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu smiled faintly. \"Since you have no attachments and have a connection with Ru Yan, why not stay in Olan City? Our Guild here also greatly needs people. I'm currently discussing with the Imperial Mages' Guild to see if we can also organize a team, similar to the Blazing Lion Knight Order, to have them join the Knight Order.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Your Grace, I'm afraid that might not be so easy, as far as I know. All the mages of the Blazing Lion Knight Order specialize in fire-element magic. Furthermore, for mages to directly join a Knight Order, they need long-term coordinated training to achieve perfect synergy. Otherwise, it's very easy to accidentally injure one's own side. I deeply respect Auntie Yu, but I still have many things I haven't resolved*, so I cannot stay.\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu didn't mind Nian Bing's refusal and smiled faintly. \"In that case, so be it. However, if you ever find yourself struggling out in the world, or if the Ice Moon Empire's Mages' Guild can't accommodate you, I welcome you to Olan City at any time. You've come a long way; staying with us for a few days would also allow us to extend our hospitality.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"I have friends waiting, so I'm afraid I cannot stay in Olan City for long. Your Grace, Auntie Yu, I have a request I hope you can grant.\"\n\nYu Ru Yan smiled gently and said, \"Just tell me what you wish for. Auntie will do her best to satisfy you.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes were filled with deep emotion as he gazed at Yu Ru Yan. \"Auntie, in my heart, I have always regarded you as a mother. Back then, we had only just met and were not familiar with each other, yet you gave me the precious Heavenly Splendor Token. Later, during my magic cultivation, it was the Heavenly Splendor Token, with its gentle aura, that pulled me back from the brink of cultivation deviation. You could say you are my savior. I hope you can give me a chance to repay you. Please grant me one day to prepare. After one day, I hope to cook a meal for you, alright?\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu and Yu Ru Yan were both stunned. Yu Ru Yan thought she had misheard. \"Cook? Nian Bing, Auntie doesn't understand what you mean.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled confidently. \"Auntie, you'll understand tomorrow. I'll go back first, and come again tomorrow. I'll be able to enter by showing the Heavenly Splendor Token then, right?\"\n\nYu Ru Yan nodded. \"Of course, you can. But aren't you a mage? How did you also become a chef?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Auntie, I was originally a chef! Do you remember the old man who was with me when we first met? He was my culinary teacher. For me, cooking is just as important as magic. Your Grace, Auntie Yu, I'll take my leave now.\" Having said that, he bowed respectfully to both of them and turned to leave.\n\nWatching Nian Bing's receding figure, Duke Lan Yu frowned slightly. \"Ru Yan, what do you think of this young man? Are you sure he's the child you met back then?\"\n\nYu Ru Yan nodded. \"There's no mistake. Not only does he have the Heavenly Splendor Token, but he can also accurately recount our first meeting. Most importantly, the emotion in his eyes is the same as it was back then, without the slightest change. It's just that this child has grown up and is much more rational than he was then. Brother Yu, I've always felt this child is extraordinary and will surely achieve great things in the future. I just don't understand why he wants to be a chef.\"\n\nLan Yu smiled faintly. \"Ru Yan, don't underestimate any profession, even that of a chef. Let us wait with anticipation and see what kind of surprise he brings us tomorrow. Judging by his confident demeanor, he clearly has faith in his culinary skills. If he truly is a talent, I would hope you could use his feelings for you to persuade him to stay. Right now, what our Empire lacks most is talent!\"\n\nYu Ru Yan frowned slightly. \"Brother Yu, how can you let me exploit Nian Bing's pure affection? If he's willing to stay, of course, that's good. But if he's not, we shouldn't force him, alright?\"\n\nLan Yu chuckled. \"My apologies, I misspoke. We'll do as you say. However, I can also sense his extraordinariness. Especially his eyes; they are eyes filled with wisdom!\"\n\nAfter leaving the Duke's residence, Nian Bing didn't return to the inn. Instead, he hurried to a nearby magic supplies store and sold all nine of the scrolls he had made. If he hadn't met Yu Ru Yan, perhaps he would have only sold three or four, but now it was different. He hoped to let Yu Ru Yan taste the delicious food he made, so he now needed more funds to purchase various precious ingredients.\n\nOf the nine magic scrolls, Nian Bing tested one on the spot. The remaining eight were immediately sold for two hundred and fifty gold coins each. After all, such protective and life-saving magic scrolls didn't require magic to activate, making them desirable to anyone, especially nobles. Therefore, even though they were only fourth-tier scrolls, it was inevitable that they would sell for a high price.\n\nAfter inquiring at the magic supplies store about Olan City's most prosperous district, Nian Bing, carrying the two hundred gold coins he'd earned from selling the scrolls, purchased a large quantity of ingredients, as well as various seasonings and culinary herbs he needed. The reason he needed a day to prepare was that the seasonings were the most crucial. In cooking, seasonings not only make food taste better but also, if used well, can bring out the original flavor of the dish even better. Truly good seasonings require a combination of multiple spices—that is the secret never passed down.\n\nBack at the inn, Nian Bing carefully pushed open the door. Galamandis's dragon snore showed no signs of lessening. Dragons were not only the strongest creatures on the continent but also the most prone to sleep. Nian Bing sighed with relief. He secretly prayed that Galamandis would preferably sleep continuously until after he had finished cooking for Auntie Yu tomorrow.\n\nHe took out packets of seasonings from his spatial ring. Then, he took out the porcelain bottles he had just bought one by one, marked them, and then began skillfully combining the various seasonings. For Nian Bing, only two things could make him fully engrossed: one was magic cultivation, and the other was cooking.\n\nCooking for Galamandis could be called a torment; it was completely against his will. In that state, although Nian Bing still made delicious food, the quality of the dishes was far inferior compared to when he cooked for himself. Since leaving the Peach Blossom Forest, Nian Bing had never desired to make a perfect meal as much as he did now. Completely focused on combining the seasonings, he didn't notice Galamandis, who, while still snoring, had opened his eyes behind him, a strange smile on his lips, with a few drops of dragon's drool trickling down.\n\nThe seasoning preparation took Nian Bing a full *shichen* (two hours). Looking at the nearly thirty porcelain bottles filled with seasonings before him, Nian Bing placed them one by one into his spatial ring. Activating it with magic power, he tentatively retrieved the bottles one after another according to his purpose, accurately grasping their positions within the spatial ring and the marks on each bottle. He nodded in satisfaction.\n\nHe fetched a basin of clear water, bought a clean towel from the inn, and took out his four peerless divine blades, carefully wiping them clean bit by bit. He didn't want the slightest flaw when cooking for Yu Ru Yan tomorrow. After preparing everything, Nian Bing sat cross-legged on the bed. He finally touched the warm Heavenly Splendor Token on his chest before entering a meditative state.\n\nThe evolved Ice and Fire Coexistence no longer required him to cautiously restrain the absorbed magic elements. With the coordination of ice and fire, both types of magic elements were absorbed at a faster rate than before. His spiritual power was fully unleashed, and soon, Nian Bing, having cast aside all distractions, entered deep meditation. His magical power was progressing bit by bit.\n\nFrom afternoon until early the next morning, the moment the sun's rays entered the room, Nian Bing opened his eyes. At this moment, he himself didn't realize that one of his deep blue eyes had turned a fiery red, while the other was as clear as the azure sky. His magical power moved with his thoughts, instantly flowing throughout his body, filling it with a magical aura that felt incredibly comfortable. He stretched his body, and his gaze fell on Galamandis beside him. Galamandis was still sound asleep; everything was as beautiful as he had imagined.\n\nHe lightly and quietly got out of bed. Although the inn was somewhat rudimentary, it did have a bathroom. Nian Bing took a refreshing bath, washing away the last trace of his unease. From his spatial ring, he took out the set of clothes Xue Jing had given him.\n\nThe white robe was embroidered with silver dragon patterns. There wasn't much embroidery, but it served as the perfect finishing touch*, making the entire outfit elegant amidst its luxury. The waist sash was simple, also white, with a slightly wide silver line on each side, and a milky white jade stone adorned its center. Stroking the soft white garment, Nian Bing couldn't help but think of Xue Jing, whom he had driven away. *Jing'er*, how are you doing now? I hope you don't blame me; I was truly forced to do it. Although your temper is a bit fiery, it doesn't change the fact that you're a good girl. I hope you can find your other half and live a happy life.\n\nDressed in this silver dragon white robe, combined with Nian Bing's already handsome appearance, his noble* aura became even more pronounced. The white robe outlined his slender physique, and a pair of ocean-deep blue eyes shimmered faintly. Taking a deep breath, Nian Bing strode out, leaving the inn.\n\nJust as Nian Bing had left the inn, Galamandis, who had been sleeping in the room, sat up from the bed. \"Good for you, kid! Going to make delicious peach shortbread for others and not call me? Hmph, I'll go have a meal too. Nian Bing, Nian Bing, do you think the spiritual imprint I put on you merely tells me your location? Heh heh...\"\n\nWalking on the street, Nian Bing felt increasingly awkward, as almost every passerby would stare at him intently, especially young maidens. Their gazes made him uneasy. \"Is the Olan Empire really so open? It seems I should have worn coarse cloth clothes!\" What could he do in such a situation? He could only quicken his pace, arriving at Duke Lan Yu's residence as quickly as possible.\n\nHe showed the Heavenly Splendor Token, and the Silver Feather Knights at the gate readily allowed him entry. Led by a servant, he walked toward Duke Lan Yu's study. On ordinary days, when Duke Lan Yu wasn't attending imperial court, he would handle his affairs in the study.\n\nUpon reaching the study door, he heard clear voices conversing inside.\n\n\"Your Grace, these are the reports our sisters have gathered over the past six months. Do you have any further instructions?\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu said, \"Yes, you've had a tough time these past days. You don't need to go back out this time. I have other tasks for you to carry out, so rest in the residence for now.\"\n\nUpon hearing these two sentences, the servant leading Nian Bing into the residence stepped forward to report, announcing loudly from outside the door, \"Your Grace, Young Master Nian Bing has arrived.\"\n\n\"Oh, let him in.\"\n\nHearing the voices from the earlier conversation, Nian Bing felt that the female voice was very familiar, as if he had heard it somewhere before, but it wasn't Yu Ru Yan's voice. While he was pondering, the servant had already gestured for him to enter. He stepped forward, pushed the door open, and entered. He saw Duke Lan Yu still seated behind his desk as he had been yesterday, and Yu Ru Yan standing beside him, looking at him with a smile. In front of the desk stood two other women, bowing respectfully. At the sound of his entry, the two women subconsciously turned to look.\n\nNian Bing's eyes widened in surprise. \"Ah! How can it be you two?\"\n\nExclamations rang out simultaneously, \"How can it be you?\"\n---\n*   *Footnote for \"沒有做豁然\": The original phrase \"沒有做豁然\" is grammatically unusual. It appears to imply \"things yet to be completed, clarified, or resolved.\"\n*   *Footnote for \"畫龍點睛\": A Chinese idiom meaning \"to add the finishing touch\" or \"to bring the piece to life.\"\n*   *Footnote for \"靜兒\": An affectionate diminutive for Xue Jing.\n*   *Footnote for \"高中\": This is likely a typo in the original for \"高貴\" (noble/dignified). Translating as \"noble\" fits the context of his appearance.",

    "content": "Who were the two women who appeared in Duke Lan Yu's study, capable of astonishing Nian Bing to such an extent? They were none other than the sisters Ruyi and Rumeng, whom Nian Bing had encountered months ago in a brothel in Ice Orchid City. After a brief blankness in his mind, Nian Bing immediately understood the sisters' identities. He had already known back then that these sisters were spies sent by another country into the Ice Moon Empire and Aolan Empire. Now that they had appeared in the mansion of Duke Lan Yu, the Aolan Empire's military brain, it was clear that they were his subordinates. And the benefactor's daughter she spoke of should be young lady Lan Chen, who was not currently in the mansion. Now, all that was left was to see a certain fickle and ungrateful person. Truly, the road for enemies is narrow!¹\n\nDuke Lan Yu, surprised, looked at the completely transformed Nian Bing and asked, \"Do you two know each other?\"\n\nRuyi snorted coldly and said, \"Duke, he is the strange young man I just told you about. That Devil Slayer Envoy also acted against us because of him. Don't let him go. Lure that Devil Slayer Envoy behind him out.\" Saying this, she raised her hand and drew her personal sword.\n\n\"Sister, he's not a bad person,\" Rumeng hurriedly pulled her sister's hand. When reporting to the Duke just now, Ruyi had been doing all the talking herself, and Rumeng had tried to interject several times but found no opportunity.\n\nRuyi said angrily, \"What good man would go to a place like a brothel? Get out of the way! If you hadn't let him off that day, perhaps I wouldn't have suffered that humiliation from the Devil Slayer Envoy.\"\n\nLan Yu said in a deep voice, \"Ruyi, stop. Do not be presumptuous.\"\n\nRuyi might not listen to others' words, but her respect for Lan Yu was entirely from the heart. She quickly sheathed her sword and stepped aside, \"I'm sorry, Duke.\"\n\nLan Yu's gaze turned to Nian Bing, and with a slight frown, he said, \"Young man. As a man, one can be romantic, but not lewd. It's better to avoid places of pleasure in the future. I want to know what relationship you have with the Devil Slayer Envoy Ruyi spoke of.\"\n\nNian Bing said indifferently, \"What you wish to know is probably not my relationship with him. You're probably curious about the origin of Ice-Fire Homologous Magic, aren't you? If it were anyone else asking, I would definitely not say, but you are Aunt Yu's husband. I don't wish to conceal it. In truth, I am the Devil Slayer Envoy, that is to say, me. At that time, I disguised myself to punish Miss Ruyi because she attacked without discerning right from wrong. Frankly, if Miss Rumeng hadn't pleaded for her sister, perhaps she would have already died by my hand.\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu's eyes lit up greatly, \"You are the Devil Slayer Envoy. I hope you can explain.\" Surprise also simultaneously appeared in Ruyi's and Rumeng's eyes.\n\nNian Bing stood tall and proud, saying coldly, \"I have nothing to explain regarding this matter, nor do I need to explain anything. Miss Ruyi is your subordinate, and it's only right that you believe her words.\" At this moment, his heart felt an unbearable pain, as if pricked by needles, because he saw coldness and a hint of killing intent in the eyes of Aunt Yu Ruyan, whom he respected the most, standing by the desk. Yes, although Aunt Yu held a high position in his heart, he had, after all, only seen her twice in so many years. What right did he have to make others believe him?\n\nNian Bing smiled. The intense sadness in his eyes caused Yu Ruyan's heart to tremble slightly. Nian Bing's heart was very, very cold. Ever since leaving the Peach Blossom Grove, he had constantly maintained vigilance, holding back with everyone, even Feng Nü was no exception. But after seeing Yu Ruyan yesterday, he finally opened his heart. Losing his parents was the greatest pain in his heart, and in his mind, Yu Ruyan's gentleness and kindness were like a mother's. Although he knew that it was normal for Yu Ruyan and Duke Lan Yu to suspect him, the pain in his heart was still exceptionally strong.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he forced himself to calm his emotions. He didn't even glance at Ruyi, saying gloomily, \"Aunt, no matter how you view me, in my heart, you will always be someone I respect. I will leave, and I won't come back again. However, I hope you can give me a chance to cook a meal for you. I'll leave immediately after.\" As he spoke, he took off the Tianhua Plaque from his neck, which had never left him for over seven years. He walked past Yu Ruyan, took a deep look at the red gem on the plaque, and with a sigh, placed the Tianhua Plaque on the table.\n\nYu Ruyan said indifferently, \"Do you truly have nothing to explain?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"To you and the Duke, I am just an outsider. Our meeting back then could be said to be a kind of connection. Perhaps now, our connection has ended.\"\n\nCold light burst from Yu Ruyan's eyes, \"Nian Bing, in my life, what I hate most are fickle and ungrateful men, especially men who inflict pain upon women for their own desires. Ruyi grew up under my watch. She has a strong-willed temperament and would never lie. Indeed, I choose to believe her. You have a very good appearance, but if this appearance of yours is used to bully women, then you are not even as good as a dwarf with a congenital defect. You may leave. I'm not in the mood to eat right now, and I certainly don't want to eat anything you've made.\"\n\n\"Aunt, can you truly not give me a chance to repay you?\" Nian Bing suddenly felt his breathing becoming difficult, and his eyes blurred slightly.\n\nYu Ruyan was about to speak, but Duke Lan Yu interjected, \"Ruyan, let him do it. I think this child isn't that kind of person. Perhaps it was just a momentary lapse.\"\n\nYu Ruyan looked at her husband, then at Nian Bing. The coldness in her gaze softened slightly, and she let out a light snort, saying nothing more.\n\nNian Bing calmly bowed to Duke Lan Yu and said, \"Thank you, Duke, for giving me this opportunity. Would you mind having a stove set up in the training ground outside? If it's in the kitchen, it's not very convenient for me to display my skills. Also, I'll need a large table for placing dishes, that's all. I've already prepared other ingredients and kitchenware.\"\n\nLan Yu nodded and said, \"Good. Ruyi, go and have someone prepare things as Nian Bing described. We'll all go to the training ground.\"\n\nRuyi assented and gave Nian Bing a cold look before leaving the study. Nian Bing followed her out; he didn't say anything to Ruyi. At this moment, in his despondent state, he didn't want to say anything more. Moreover, Ruyi herself was also a pitiful person. Seeing Nian Bing leave, Rumeng said eagerly, \"Duke, Madam, you've both misunderstood. Nian Bing isn't that kind of person.\"\n\nLan Yu and Yu Ruyan simultaneously froze. Yu Ruyan frowned and said, \"Are you saying that Ruyi was lying to us just now?\"\n\nRumeng's whole body stiffened, \"No, actually, Sister, Sister was just a little extreme.\" Immediately, she recounted what happened that day from beginning to end, from her own perspective.\n\nAfter listening to Rumeng's words, Lan Yu frowned deeply and said, \"No! From what I know, Ruyi, though strong-willed by nature, has always been someone who understands the bigger picture. Otherwise, I wouldn't have let her oversee the northern intelligence system. I truly can't believe her personality would undergo such a major change. Rumeng, are you hiding something from me? What exactly happened to Ruyi?\" The astute man had already spotted some discrepancies. A change in a person's character is never without reason.\n\nRumeng knelt down with a thud, \"Duke, Madam, I cannot say. This matter concerns my sister's reputation. Sister, Sister is already very pitiful. Please don't pursue it further, okay?\"\n\nYu Ruyan's whole body trembled, and light flashed in her eyes like lightning, \"I understand now. So it was him. I wondered why Ruyi had changed so much in the past two years and actively requested a transfer. So that's how it is. Humph, I won't let that brat off.\"\n\nRumeng was greatly startled and hurriedly said, \"Madam, actually, you can't completely blame Big Brother Lan Xun for this matter. He also has his own difficulties. Matters of the heart—\" Just as she said this, she suddenly noticed the change in Yu Ruyan's gaze. Only then did she understand that she had been tricked. \"Madam, I...\"\n\nYu Ruyan's whole body flashed with a layer of silver light, \"Lan Xun, it was Lan Xun, that brat! How dare you, you've kept me in the dark so cruelly! Rumeng, tell me everything. Do you know that your sister treated human life as mere grass in this Nian Bing matter? If you don't speak, I will punish her.\" As Duke Lan Yu's wife, how could a young girl like Rumeng compare to Yu Ruyan? With just one probing question, she discovered everything. She now finally understood Nian Bing's gaze from earlier, and her heart was filled with regret. However, what she urgently needed to know now was what exactly happened to Ruyi.\n\nArriving at the training ground, Nian Bing walked alone to a shaded spot and stood there. No one was practicing martial arts there today; the training ground was empty, with only occasional servants from the Duke's mansion passing by. He suddenly remembered what Cha Ji had told him when teaching him cooking skills. At that time, Cha Ji had said that an ordinary chef, during the cooking process, must pay attention to one very important thing: controlling their emotions. When cooking, one should try their best not to let emotions affect their culinary skills, fully displaying their inherent techniques. However, when a chef's skills reached the pinnacle, in terms of emotions, it was precisely the opposite: one was not to control them, but to fully express them, using emotions to influence the delicacies one made. For top-tier chefs, food made with different emotions, even the same dish, could taste different. Emotions were the most important thing for top-tier chefs to learn.\n\nNow, his heart was filled with sorrow. What kind of dishes could he make? He didn't know; he himself didn't know. Taking a deep breath, and then a long sigh, he thought that after he finished this meal, his relationship with Yu Ruyan would also come to an end, and there would be no further connection between them.\n\n\"Brother, I don't seem to have seen you before.\" A gentle voice sounded from behind him. Nian Bing's whole body trembled. He hadn't even noticed someone approaching him; he was truly too careless. Turning to look, he saw a young man in blue warrior attire, with a long sword at his waist, standing behind him. This person was extremely handsome, especially the vibrant heroic spirit emanating from him, which easily gave others a good impression. From the faintly discernible powerful aura around him, it was clear that he was at least a warrior at the Grand Swordsman level, or perhaps even a martial artist.\n\n\"Hello, I've just arrived at the Duke's mansion,\" Nian Bing's reply was plain and courteous.\n\nThe blue-clad warrior, upon seeing Nian Bing's appearance, couldn't help but let a flash of surprise appear in his eyes. He had always prided himself on his exceptional appearance, but compared to the young man in gold and silver clothes before him, he was far inferior. \"Brother, you are truly radiant in presence. My name is Lan Xun, I am the Duke's guard officer. May I know your name? Why have you come to the Duke's mansion?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"My name is Nian Bing. I am a chef who has come to cook for the Duke and Duchess.\"\n\n\"A chef?\" Lan Xun's eyes widened greatly with surprise. He sized Nian Bing up and down a few times and said with a strange look in his eyes, \"You, a chef?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"What, doesn't it seem so? I'll prove it in a moment.\"\n\nJust as he said this, Ruyi had already led people to the training ground, directing the servants from the Duke's mansion to set up the stove. Inadvertently looking up, she saw Nian Bing and Lan Xun together. Her pretty face instantly frosted over, and she cursed softly, \"Truly, birds of a feather flock together.\"\n\nThe spot where Nian Bing stood was not far from the center of the training ground. Furthermore, after eating so many Iron-Thread Snake gallbladders, both his hearing and eyesight had greatly improved. Hearing this, his heart stirred involuntarily. He looked at Lan Xun. At this moment, the expression on Lan Xun's face changed simultaneously, and complex emotions appeared in his pair of dark eyes.\n\n\"You're the man who wronged Miss Ruyi?\" Nian Bing's voice became even colder. His relationship with Aunt Yu Ruyan had become so strained because of Ruyi's words to the Duke, and Ruyi's change was precisely because of that faithless man.\n\nLan Xun's expression changed, and he said, \"What kind of talk is this? I never wronged Ruyi. It was she who insisted on leaving me. It seems you know quite a lot!\"\n\nNian Bing said in surprise, \"You never wronged Ruyi? But how is it that I heard you wronged her for a prettier girl?\"\n***\n¹ \"Truly, the road for enemies is narrow!\" (冤家路窄, Yuānjiālùzhǎi): An idiom meaning that adversaries are bound to meet again, often unexpectedly; \"It's a small world for enemies.\"",

    "content": "A bitterness appeared in blue eyes, \"I don't know what Ruyi said to you, but my feelings for Ruyi are absolutely true. Alas, Ruyi is good, but she is too stubborn.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingzhui asked, \"Then since you were together with Ruyi, why are you attentive to other girls?\"\n\n\n\nBlue eyebrows said, \"Are you diligent? It seems that Ruyi doesn't believe me now, it's OK. I used to like Miss Chen, but later when I was most disappointed, Ruyi walked into my world. It was her meticulous concern that helped me recover from the loss. It was me that I realized that she was the woman who suited me the most, so we were together. , I really love her. At the same time, I also knew my position. Even if I don’t talk about my status, I am far from being able to match my character and appearance. Therefore, I have already let go of my previous relationship. Later, Miss Chen returned home from her teacher, and I can already treat her as a sister. The Duke has long since he was young to take these lonely people. As his servant, I was concerned about the lady's daily life and arranged various things for her. I had done all these tasks before. However, Ruyi didn't understand. She thought that my old love for the lady was revived and interesting to the lady. No matter how I explained it, she couldn't hear it, and she quarreled with me every day about this. I am a man I still have a lot to do. One day, I was really angry with her, so I said a few words that hurt her. As a result, she asked the Duke for external comment the next day and refused to pay attention to me again. Alas, I was too moved at that time. Although Ruyi was a girl, she was very firm. I wanted to get close to her as much as possible, and she was always like an iceberg. \"\n\n\n\nNian Bing stared at Blue with wide eyes. She wouldn't be so unlucky, she turned out to be a miserable victim. \"Brother Blue, when you hurt Miss Ruyi, did you tell her that you were lustful and heartless towards her? Miss Ruyi is just a substitute for Miss Chen, and you only love Miss Chen.\"\n\n\n\nBlue also widened her eyes, \"No, you know, what's the relationship between you and Ruyi.\"\n\n\n\nLooking at the bad face of the blue face, Nian Bing hurriedly said, \"Miss Ruyi and I have nothing to do with it. This is what Miss Ruyi told me. Brother Blue, how could you say that at the beginning? Do you know how much harm a girl is like this?\"\n\n\n\nBlue gave me a sigh and said, \"You think I think I'm saying that! But Ruyi has been both dead since her childhood parents, and she is too inferior. She likes to think about everything. Since she started quarreling with me, she will ask me every day if I was with her because she went to bed with me, do you still love Miss Chen, and do you think she is a substitute? Think about it, I work so much every day, and she is so chaotic every day, can I stand it? That day, I was so angry that I was so angry that I said to her.\n\n\n\nNian Bing understood everything this time. It turns out that Blue is not a person who is indifferent.The real problem was still on Ruyi, patted her blue shoulder and said, \"Do you still like Ruyi?\"\n\n\n\nBlue said bitterly: \"If I don't like her, would it be so painful? We have already had the reality of husband and wife. I really love her, so how can I not resist it?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing pointed a little and said, \"Since you really love her, you should show your courage. The deep love and hatred of you. Ruyi is so cruel to you, it proves that she can't forget you at all. Since that's the case, you have a lot of opportunities, it depends on whether you can grasp it. She has been inferior since childhood and needs your patient understanding to change. I think you must have communicated too little in the past to have a distrust crisis. You are a man, take the initiative.\"\n\n\n\nBlue pointed at the head and smiled and said, \"I thought so too. Ruyi finally came back this time. I have already decided that no matter what, I will keep her this time. Brother, although this is our first time meeting, we have been very involved. Thank you for your explanation. Alas, I just don't know when the time is best to get close to her.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and shook her head, saying, \"Brother Blue, don't be polite. In fact, it's not difficult to find any time. If you want Ruyi to revive your heart, the first thing you have to do is to get the support of the Duke and the Duchess. I can see that they are the most respected people of Miss Ruyi. Since you have decided to be with Ruyi, why not start with the Duke and the Duchess?\"\n\n\n\nAfter hearing Nian Bing's words, his blue eyes lit up, and he slapped his thighs suddenly and said, \"Yes! Why didn't I think of it? Nian Bing, you are really a dreamer, okay, I will go to the Duke. As long as the Duke agrees to our affairs, everything will be much easier.\" As he said, he turned around and was about to leave.\n\n\n\n\"What are you anxious about?\" Nian Bing grabbed Lan, \"The Duke and the Duchess are coming here soon to taste the food I cooked. Isn't it better to say it as a girl Ruyi? It also shows your sincerity. Well, look, they are here.\" At this time, Duke of Blue Feather, Yu Ruyi, and Ruyi came to the martial arts venue from the backyard. Blue Feather and Yu Ruyi's faces were unusually dark, and Ruyi's head was lowered, looking like they were worried.\n\n\n\nNian Bing didn't know that his mistake had been clarified. When she saw their expressions, her heart sank. She touched the blue side of her body and said, \"You can't go quickly.\"\n\n\n\nBlue had only wishes in her heart at this time, and she did not notice the expressions of the Duke and Duchess of Blue Feather. When Nian Bing touched him, he quickly stepped forward and came to the Duke and Duchess of Blue Feather. \n\n\n\nYu Ruyi was holding her stomach up and there was no place to stay. She felt that someone was approaching. She looked calmly and found that it was the blue she was looking for. She was about to rush up and just opened her mouth. She saw that the blue she cried and knelt down on the ground with a sound, \"Duke, Duke, Duchess, Blue Feather has something to report.\"\n\n\n\nBlue raised his hand and slapped the Yu Rufuji that he was about to make, and said calmly: \"If you have anything, just say it.\"\n\n\n\nBlue Yu swallowed and glanced at Ruyi, who was covered with frost, and then said, \"Duke, Blue has been taught by you and your wife from now on. Although Blue knows that she is not worthy, in my heart, I have always regarded you as a father. There is one thing I have never reported to you and your wife. In fact, I had a good relationship with Ruyi three years ago. I hope that the Duke and Mrs. can allow me to marry Ruyi as my wife. I am absolutely sincere to Ruyi.\" After speaking, I respectfully kowtowed three reciprocals to the Duke and Mrs.\n\n\n\nBlue Yu and Yu Ruyi were originally full of surprise. Ru Huan Han's angry eyes were instantly occupied by surprise. Ru Meng, who was lowering her head, looked up at Blue who was kneeling on the ground in shock. Who would have thought that at this time, Blue Yu would say this, and Ruyi, who was standing far away, was stiff all over, and her eyes became dull in an instant. Still, Blue Yu's heart was the most stable and said calmly: \"You want to marry Ruyi?\"\n\n\n\nBlue decided to make a point and said, \"Please help the Lord Duke.\"\n\n\n\nThe blue-feathered eyebrows said with a slight smile: \"As far as I know, the relationship between you and Ruyi is not just so simple, Ruyi, you have come.\"\n\n\n\nRuyi woke up from the silence, with a very complicated look in her beautiful eyes. She glanced at the blue and quickly walked to the Duke of Blue Feather. He said respectfully, \"Sir, the kitchen and stove are ready, and you can use it anytime.\" Although she was talking about the tasks ordered by Duke Blue Feather, her voice was trembling uncontrollably. \n\n\n\nBlue feather pointed a little, turned his eyes to Nian Bing who was standing beside him, and smiled and said, \"Little brother, please wait a moment, I'll handle some private affairs in the house.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingzhen said, \"Duke, don't be polite, you talk to you. I'm going to cook now.\" As he said, he walked towards the chef. Yu Ruyi wanted to say something, but when he saw the blue and Ruyi in front of him, he still endured it first, winked at her husband, and signaled him to enter the topic directly.\n\n\n\nBlue feather's voice was slightly deeper and he said, \"Blue, I want to hear your explanation of your relationship with Ruyi.\"\n\n\n\nRuyi glared at her sister and said, \"Duke, don't explain anything. I have nothing to do with Blue, and I will never marry him. Ruyi will serve the Duke and Madam throughout her life and will never marry him. Please do your best.\" Her words were extremely determined, and her voice seemed to be cold and could contain the air around her.\n\n\n\nBlue felt a sigh of relief. Although he knew Ruyi was very solid, he did not expect that after more than two years of not seeing her, her solidity seemed to be more difficult to understand than before.\n\n\n\nBlue Yu smiled slightly, and his voice became softer, \"Silly, you and Blue are both things I have grown up from childhood. Blue just said it well. I have always treated you as my children. To me, you are not subordinate, but my family and children. Do you think a father will be willing to watch his daughter be alone and lonely? No, of course not. If that happens, this father will be incomparable to pain.Even if you don’t want to marry blue, you don’t have to make such a decision. I will definitely find you a good stay in the future. \"\n\n\n\nListening to the words of Blue Yu Cihe, Ruyi's eyes were red and she choked and said, \"Thank you, Duke. I...\"\n\n\n\nBlue feather held Ruyi and didn't let her continue talking. She turned her head and said in a cold voice: \"Now you don't need to explain. I just want to hear your relationship with Ruyi. Tell me, I believe you won't cheat me.\"\n\n\n\nBlue still knelt there. Without Blue Yu's instructions, he would never stand up and said respectfully: \"Duke Duke, Ruyi and I started having a relationship three years ago. I'm not afraid of you laughing. Originally, I liked Miss Chenchen. Although I know I'm not worthy, my potential idea always hopes that I have an opportunity, so I'm always working hard.\"\n\n\n\nBlue feather pointed at him and said, \"You are concerned about Chenchen's meticulous concern. Everyone sees it. There is nothing to be worthy of it. If Chenchen really likes you, I will never stop him. However, you also know Chenchen's situation. Now, Ruyi and I are worried about her final life. What will happen in the future? Everything is not easy to say.\" When she said this, the duke's face looked a little sad, and Yu Ruyi shook her head helplessly. When she thought of her daughter, she felt a little regretful. If it weren't for those people chasing them too quickly, she wouldn't have made a bad decision to send her daughter to that person as her apprentice. The Duke of Blue Feather continued, \"But you should also feel that Chenchen has always treated you as a brother. Although he is usually a little cold, she is the best for you at home except me and Ruyi.\"\n\n\n\nBlue said, \"Duke Duke. Later I understood this problem. Miss Chenchen told me that day. She said she always regarded me as a brother, and for special reasons, she could not easily combine with the man. Although her voice was cold, I could feel the inner one. The stocks were really folded. At that time, I felt that I seemed to have been relieved from the retraction of my feelings. It was also from that moment that I really gave up my pursuit of Miss Chenchen. Miss Chenchen left, and the trust in my heart disappeared for many years. Although I was already enlightened, I was filled with loss. It was at this time that Ruyi entered my world. She cared about me and accompanied me, silently sat with me all night. That night, we sat calmly. Although she didn't say anything, I felt the emotions in her heart. I only realized that the person who suited me the most was the one who suited me the most. I was actually around me, and my heart moved. My feelings for Miss Chenchen really changed into a brother-sister relationship. Just as I felt for Ruyi, I had a pursuit of her. Lord Duke, Ruyi cannot marry someone else because, because I already have a husband and wife between me and her.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing had already made preparations after he had reached the chef, but when he heard the blue account, he couldn't help but stand up and listen to how he explained to the Duke.As a sidekick, he could see that the Duke of Blue Feather and Yu Ruyi seemed to have known something, and Ruyi's destiny was a bit abnormal. It was very likely that they told them what he had happened that day. As for their current anger, it was obvious that they were going to go to the blue. It seemed that they had already learned about Ruyi and Blue from Ruyi. The guy's luck is really good. Just when Duke Blue Feather was preparing to ask for his crime, the matter might be a turnaround, but the key to it now is still on Ruyi. However, looking at her frozen look, it is probably not so easy to influence. It depends on your ability.\n\n\n\nWhen Blue said that she had already married Ruyi, although Blue Yu and Yu Ruyi had already known it, her face turned blue. Blue glanced at Ruyi, and her expression did not change because of her own narrative. She was still looking at everything coldly, as if she had not heard her voice at all. There was a secret voice, and then he repeated what he had said to Nian Bing, adding more details. When he was telling, his feelings gradually became infected by language. When he said that he and Ruyi had been incorrectly at the end, the cold face of Ruyi finally changed. The iceberg instantly turned into a volcano and its expression suddenly became extremely exciting, \"You said nonsense, at that time you had always regarded me as a substitute, but now you were just angry, and you clearly wanted to deceive the Duke and his wife by clever words. If you are beaten, I don't want to see you, let alone marry you.\"",

    "content": "Lan Xun's expression changed repeatedly. \"Ruyi, can't you calm down and think carefully? I waited for you for two years, hoping you would become calmer, but you are still so stubborn. Do you think this is good for you? Why can't you be more rational? The Ruyi I once knew wasn't like this. Ruyi, we grew up together. Although I dare not claim to be an upright gentleman*, I, Lan Xun, have never told Duke Lan Yu a single lie in my life. I can swear before you all that everything I, Lan Xun, say is the truth, or else Heaven will strike me down and Earth will consume me.\"\n\nRuyi froze for a moment, but the rage in her eyes showed no sign of subsiding. \"Then what do you mean today? No matter what, there is no longer any relationship between us. Your proposal to His Grace today, isn't that intentionally trying to humiliate me?\"\n\nLan Xun sighed and said, \"Ruyi, how could I think that way? In my heart, you have always held a position of paramount importance. You are my beloved! For over two years, you traveled far to the border to carry out a mission, and not a day passed that I wasn't thinking of you. I proposed to His Grace because I love you! What will it take for you to believe that I am sincere about you?\"\n\nRuyi's heart trembled. Looking at Lan Xun's handsome and sincere face, the anger on her face gradually subsided. She stared blankly at him. She couldn't believe that it had all just been a misunderstanding.\n\nLan Yu spoke. \"Enough, both of you stop talking. I understand the matter now. No matter what, using words to provoke and hurt Ruyi is Lan Xun's fault. Lan Xun, you have followed me for so many years. You know my temper. Ruyi, you have been wronged, rest assured, I will get justice for you. How about this: Ruyi, from now on, I will take you and Rumeng as my goddaughters**. Lan Xun has hurt my daughter, and he must pay the price he deserves. Lan Xun, you don't need to explain anything further. Ruyi traveled far to the border for you for over two years, suffering untold hardships. Now, there is no longer any affection between you and her, but the pain you inflicted upon her can never be erased. I won't say more about other things; take your own life.\"\n\n\"What?\" The three cried out in surprise simultaneously: one was Ruyi, and the other two were Yu Ruyan and Nian Bing. Yu Ruyan said urgently, \"Brother Yu, this matter can't be entirely blamed on Lan Xun. He has followed you for so many years. Don't you understand his temperament and disposition? How can you make such a rash decision to punish him? Brother Yu...\"\n\nNian Bing had already walked a few steps to Lan Xun's side. It was he who had persuaded Lan Xun to propose to Duke Lan Yu, so how could he not be anxious when such a situation arose? \"That's right! Your Grace, even if Lan Xun made a mistake, it's not worthy of death, is it? How can you disregard human life so much?\" Duke Lan Yu's rash decision greatly diminished his impression of the Duke, and at that moment, his goodwill towards the entire Duke's Manor even vanished.\n\nDuke Lan Yu's face was covered in a layer of cold frost. He said indifferently, \"Ruyan, I can listen to you on other matters, but not this one. Do you think Lan Xun is blameless? Indeed, it was a misunderstanding, but as a man, knowing it was a misunderstanding yet not properly explaining it to Ruyi, what does that show? It shows he had an intention to toy with Ruyi; it shows he valued his own dignity more than Ruyi. If he had explained to Ruyi earlier, and patiently explained things to Ruyi, would Ruyi have suffered for over two years? That child Ruyi has already suffered enough, and now she's been hurt like this. How can I tolerate it? Earlier, we wrongly accused you, but this is an internal matter of my Duke's Manor. Please do not interfere. Lan Xun, take action.\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu's tone was utterly resolute, but Nian Bing strangely noticed a hint of a smile flash in his eyes. Was it his imagination? No, absolutely not. He did smile. His mind raced, and in an instant, Nian Bing understood some of the reasons behind it. He glanced at Duke Lan Yu, then stepped back with a sigh, no longer trying to stop him.\n\nLan Xun looked up at Lan Yu, then at Ruyi. His expression became unusually calm. He said respectfully, \"Your Grace, I, Lan Xun, was raised by you since childhood. This life of mine was originally yours. I will never defy your commands. I... I have only one last request before I die, and I hope you will grant it.\" As he spoke, he knelt prostrate on the ground. His fearless resolve to face death as if returning home*** greatly impressed Nian Bing.\n\nDuke Lan Yu said indifferently, \"Speak. For the sake of you having followed me for so many years, I will try my best to grant it.\"\n\nLan Xun was not terrified despite being about to lose his life. Hearing Duke Lan Yu's assent, a hint of joy immediately appeared on his face. \"Your Grace, I truly love Ruyi sincerely. You are right; it was my inability to let go of my pride that led to Ruyi's suffering for over two years, creating an unforgettable shadow in her heart. It's all my fault; I deserve to be punished. My last request is to ask you to take good care of Ruyi, and in the future, find her a good husband, a husband who can care for and cherish her. That way, even underground, I can rest in peace. Your Grace, Madam, please take good care of yourselves. Lan Xun departs. Even in hell, I will pray for the safety of Your Grace and Madam.\" A cold glint flashed, and the longsword slid out of its sheath. Lan Xun's movement showed no hesitation. He held the sword hilt with both hands and brought it towards his own neck with almost full force. Under the sunlight, the longsword shone with a blinding cold light. Although Lan Xun did not circulate his battle qi****, everyone could see that his resolve to die was exceedingly firm.\n\nYu Ruyan closed her eyes, tears flowing down her face. Normally, Lan Yu listened to her in all aspects, but when Lan Yu became serious, Yu Ruyan would not object. Lan Xun was also someone she had watched grow up, and now he was about to lose his life just like that. She truly couldn't bear it. She quietly raised her right hand, intending to use her battle qi to rescue him. For her, there was little difference between seeing with her eyes open or closed. However, just as her hand was raised, it was grasped by Duke Lan Yu's strong hands. Yu Ruyan struggled slightly, but she immediately gave up, for she knew there was no longer enough time. Her heart gave a sudden throb, and she thought inwardly, \"It's over.\"\n\n\"No!\" A piteous cry rang out. Yu Ruyan suddenly opened her eyes, only to see Ruyi clutching Lan Xun's hand tightly with both hands, her eyes filled with sorrow. \"No! Don't die!\"\n\nLan Xun said sorrowfully, \"Ruyi. Why do you have to do this? You should understand that for us, every word from His Grace is an order. Don't stop me. Promise me, live well.\"\n\nRuyi ignored Lan Xun. While clutching his hand with all her might, she turned back to Duke Lan Yu and said, \"Your Grace, oh... no, Godfather, please spare Lan Xun!\"\n\nLan Yu said coldly, \"Ruyi, he hurt you so deeply; how can I let him off? You are my daughter; no one can bully you. Move aside. Your Godfather will definitely find you a good husband in the future.\"\n\nRuyi shook her head vigorously, tears splattering as she shook. \"No! No! Godfather, I don't want anyone else. I only want Lan Xun! Please spare him! He is the only person I have ever loved in this life!\"\n\nA hint of a smile flashed in Lan Yu's eyes again, but Ruyi, who was overwhelmed with emotion, and Lan Xun, whose spirits were low due to his impending self-execution, did not notice it. \"Ruyi, didn't you say you no longer loved him? Just now you said you would absolutely not marry him. You also know that military orders are like mountains*****. I have already given the order, and it cannot be easily retracted.\"\n\nRuyi knelt beside Lan Yu and said, sobbing, \"Godfather, everything I said just now was spoken in anger. In truth, I have always loved Lan Xun. I've thought it through. Actually, it's all my fault. It's my fault for being too extreme. If it wasn't for my jealousy back then, if it wasn't for me incessantly nagging and pressuring Lan Xun, he wouldn't have said those words in anger. Lan Xun is not at fault; I am. Godfather, if you want to punish, then punish me. Please, don't kill Lan Xun. He is a good man. He is so loyal to you. Even if he has no great merits, he has endured hardships. Please, I beg you!\"\n\nLan Yu sighed and said, \"However, the order has been given and cannot be easily changed. How about this: not all rules are absolute. If you are willing to marry him, then for the sake of him becoming my god-son-in-law******, I will spare his life. Otherwise, he has no reason to continue living. Ruyi, are you willing to marry Lan Xun?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am willing! Godfather, I am willing to marry him! Please don't kill him!\" Ruyi blurted out without thinking. Lan Xun's grip on the sword loosened, and the longsword clanged as it fell to the ground, making a clear sound. Yu Ruyan looked at her husband in astonishment, only to see Lan Yu burst into laughter. \"That's it! How nice it is to be harmonious! You children just make me worry. Now it's settled. Lan Xun, I will betroth my precious daughter Ruyi to you. You must take good care of her and cherish her from now on. If you dare to bully her again, humph, don't blame me for being impolite!\"\n\nAlthough Lan Xun was willing to die for the Duke, even ants cling to life*******, let alone humans. It was naturally best not to die. Furthermore, at this moment, being able to reconcile******** with Ruyi, everything became so wonderful. The feeling of going from great sorrow to great joy was almost unbelievable to him, but his mind was still clear. He quickly took Ruyi's hand and bowed down to Lan Yu.\n\n\"Ouch!\" The Duke, who had just been so imposing and majestic, suddenly let out a miserable cry, startling Lan Xun and Ruyi, who simultaneously jumped up from the ground. But what they saw was Yu Ruyan grabbing Lan Yu's ear with one hand, saying with an unkind expression, \"Well, Lan Yu, you were acting just now, weren't you? You even tricked me! Tell me, what are you going to do about tricking so many tears out of me?\"\n\n\"Gently, Ruyan, be gentle! I know I was wrong, please let me explain! If I hadn't acted realistically just now, how could I have made Ruyi reveal her true feelings? Did you think I would bear to kill Lan Xun? Although both of them made mistakes, Lan Xun is a man after all. For him to suffer a little bit of injustice in exchange for a wife as beautiful as a flower and as precious as jade, he still got off easy, didn't he?\"\n\nOnly then did Lan Xun and Ruyi realize what had happened. They exchanged a look, and their faces couldn't help but turn red simultaneously. They knelt on the ground again and said respectfully, \"Thank you, Your Grace, for making this possible.\"\n\nYu Ruyan released her grip on Lan Yu's ear and said, \"Still calling him Your Grace? From now on, you should call us Godfather and Godmother. I'm truly so happy that you two children can be together. Please get up.\"\n\nStanding behind Lan Xun, Nian Bing felt a hint of envy rise in his heart at this moment. How wonderful would it be if he could also marry the Phoenix Woman with the help of elders! Duke Lan Yu was truly worthy of being the Oran Empire's top military figure. His ability to orchestrate and set things right was unmatched. If he hadn't discerned some clues from his gaze, he probably would have been fooled too. His acting skills were truly superb!\n\nRuyi and Lan Xun stood up. Ruyi pulled her hand free from Lan Xun's. At this moment, her emotional burden had been resolved, and the original coldness in her eyes turned into a pool of warm spring water. She turned to Nian Bing and said, \"Mister Nian, I'm sorry. Last time, I was too impulsive and didn't clarify things before trying to kill you. Please forgive me. Actually, I could tell you weren't that kind of person; you just didn't want to admit defeat verbally. I'm sorry.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Although the feeling of being wrongly accused is hard to bear, the matter is in the past, so let's just let it be. Congratulations to Miss Ruyi and Brother Lan Xun on your union! I, your junior, don't have anything valuable on me. Today, I happen to be making a meal for Auntie Yu, so please come and taste it together. Consider it my congratulatory gift to you.\" Using a meal as a congratulatory gift seemed a bit too cheap for ordinary people. No one present paid it any mind, simply taking it as Nian Bing's goodwill. But how could they know that in the near future, the value of one of Nian Bing's meals would be incomparable to a thousand gold pieces? His skill was not something just anyone could taste.\n\nYu Ruyan walked to Nian Bing's side and said apologetically, \"Nian Bing, I wrongly accused you. Auntie was in the wrong; can you forgive Auntie?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and smiled, \"Auntie, actually, you weren't wrong. After all, we had only met twice. If it were me, I would also believe my own people. Auntie, are you still willing to give me the Heavenly Splendor Plaque?\" Facing this beautiful auntie, Nian Bing originally had no intention to blame her. At this moment, he was merely thinking, what's wrong with a mother scolding her child?\n\n\"Of course.\" Yu Ruyan took out the Heavenly Splendor Plaque from her bosom and put it back around Nian Bing's neck. The Heavenly Splendor Plaque, carrying Yu Ruyan's body temperature, pressed warmly against his chest, making Nian Bing's body and mind feel extremely comfortable. \"Auntie, I'll cook for you all now. It's about lunchtime. Please sit at the table for a bit; I'll try to be quick.\" Saying this, he walked towards the stove.\n\nYu Ruyan and Lan Yu exchanged a smile. They were also very curious about what Nian Bing, who insisted on cooking for them, would be able to make. The two of them led Lan Xun and the other two to the table set up next to the stove and sat down. Ruyi had prepared ten chairs earlier, which were now more than enough.\n\n---\n*   An \"upright gentleman\" (正人君子) in Chinese culture refers to someone of integrity, high moral standards, and honorable character.\n**   In Chinese culture, \"godchildren\" (乾女兒) are adopted symbolically, creating a bond of protection and familial responsibility without legal adoption.\n***   \"Facing death as if returning home\" (視死如歸) is an idiom describing extreme bravery and resolve, where one approaches death without fear, as if it were a familiar journey.\n****   \"Battle qi\" (鬥氣) is a common term in Chinese fantasy literature, referring to a form of internal energy or magical power used in combat.\n*****  \"Military orders are like mountains\" (軍令如山) is a Chinese idiom meaning that military commands are absolute and unchangeable, as unyielding and heavy as a mountain.\n****** \"God-son-in-law\" (乾女婿) directly translates from the previous mention of \"goddaughter\"; it implies a formal acceptance into the family through the godparent relationship, rather than a strictly biological or legal one.\n******* \"Even ants cling to life\" (螻蟻尚且偷生) is an idiom highlighting the universal desire for survival, suggesting that even the lowliest creatures value their lives.\n******** \"Reconciliation\" (破鏡重圓) is an idiom that literally means \"a broken mirror rejoined,\" signifying a couple reuniting after a separation, especially when they were previously estranged or had a significant falling out.",

    "content": "Blue Yu held Yu Ruyi's hand, and Blue held Ruyi's hand, and the five of them were all focused on Nian Bing.\n\n\n\nTake a deep breath and Nian Bing calmed down his mood. At this moment, his heart became unusually calm. With his right hand, nine pieces of cucumber appeared from the craftsmanship in the space and placed them flat on the chopping board. For the sake of today's meal, Nian Bing not only prepared the ingredients, but also prepared the dishes. The dishes that were filled with one meter were tightly covered with nine cucumbers. Nian Bing held the dishes in his left hand and led his right hand. The aura of the Aotian sword like autumn water appeared in his control. The people in front of the stove smiled and said, \"Auntie Yu, you must be a little thirsty. Each of my dishes is the body of ice and the most specialty of my ice-fire Nine Heavens cuisine---Nine Clear God Dragon Cloud.\"\n\n\n\nAotian's knife was tightly attached to the table, and nine yellow melons flew up at the same time under the action of the blade. Nian Bing placed a large plate with a straight one meter on the table. The whereabouts of the nine yellow melons were just placed flat in the plate at the same distance. The yellow melons were less than one foot long, and the nine yellow melons looked a little uneven in the large plate with a straight one meter. Nian Bing pinched a yellow melon like a flash, and her right Aotian sword was about to move. The rapid pace of his head blocked his concentration, and a silver horseman's group of riders ran in quickly.\n\n\n\n\"Report.\" The rider knelt on his knees, causing the attention of Duke Blue Feather and others to change because they were just saying \"I'm saying it.\"\n\n\n\n\"I told the Duke that there were four people outside, claiming to be acquaintances of my wife. Please see.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh?\" Lan Yu looked at her in surprise. Usually, few people came to find her wife. \"What kind of land is it? What are the characteristics?\"\n\n\n\nThe rider replied respectfully, \"The four men and two women. The two women are very young and have absolutely beautiful appearances. The two men are old men and look like seventy or eighty years old. Their common characteristics are all red clothes in their clothes, which feels like flames. The one who opened the mouth was one of the women, and they should be warriors. Everyone was carrying a long sword, and they couldn't feel that they were of their level. But they should be not weak and had a calm temperament. \"I am a member of the Silver Feathered Knights Group, and the answer was extremely simple, and I described all the basic characteristics of the other party.\n\n\n\nYu Ru's face changed and she said to Nian Bing, \"It seems that it is really not easy to eat your meal. It's finally here. Nian Bing. You go to the back and take a break first. Auntie will handle the matter.\"\n\n\n\nThe face of the Duke of Blue Feather changed at the same time, \"Like smoke, do you mean that someone is coming from there?\"\n\n\n\nYu Ruyun's eyes shone with cold light, \"Yes, it's not necessarily them. Otherwise, who would wear red clothes for men in their seventies or eighties, four people. I'm going to see which four of them are. When every one of our daughters died by them at the beginning, this account should be calculated. Brother Yu, let us all retreat.\"\n\n\n\nBlue feathers pointed their heads and said to the rider, \"Take those four people in, at the same time.\"I sent my order, without my consent, no one could disturb me regardless of the situation in the martial arts field. \"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, Lord Duke.\" The rider replied and stood up. Blue Yu twisted his head and said to Blue and Ruyi sisters, \"You are both my children and are not considered outsiders. You should also let you see what the warrior land peak is. You and Nian Bing retreated to the wall, remember, don't move no matter what the situation is, do you understand?\"\n\n\n\nThe order to Blue Yu must have been executed without any conditions. Zhao hurriedly replied, and Blue pulled Nian Bing, who was holding the Aotian knife, and retreated to the yard. Nian Bing felt something to be alive. Before retreating aside, he did not forget to put away his plate and gua. He was determined to come and report to Yu Ruyi, and he would never leave until he finished it.\n\n\n\nThe door opened, and in the middle of the meeting, four men in red-clothed men led by four riders from the Silver Feathered Riders Group, four men in red walked in. As the previous rider said, these four people were all wearing red trousers and carrying long swords on their backs. Two old men walked in front, both of whom were tall and thin, with white and red blouses in a red blouse, which looked particularly strange and strange. Their straight body was straight and invisible, scattered around their bodies. The condensing atmosphere could be seen without special observation. The two of them have eighty-point appearances, and they should be a pair of brothers. The cold eyes locked in Yu Ruyi as soon as they entered the door.\n\n\n\nBehind the two old men are two young girls. The girl on the left has a long green color, which is reflected in her red samurai uniform, which looks extremely eye-catching. Although the red and green colors are not in harmony, the girl has a different flavor. Coupled with her big ink green eyes, her beautiful appearance is as swaying as clear style. Her slender figure is very beautiful, and her walking posture is very light. The feeling of the green clothes giving people is extremely profound. Although she is very beautiful, Compared with the girl on her right, she looked a little lighter. The girl on her right looked like a pink and tidy combed behind her back. In the middle of the long section, she used a blue belt to touch her blue eyes, her blue eyes shining with her deep and deep. Her long figure and her stunning beauty were almost perfect without any flaws. Among the crowd, only Yu Ru Furnace can be compared with her. Yu Ru Furnace has a few more risks and a little less youthful breath. Four silver feathers took the four men in red into the yard and quietly retreated. Yu Ruqian stepped forward in a few steps, and her beautiful eyes were filled with murderers. \n\n\n\n\"The girl of the geese.\" Nian Bing's full of surprise sound broke the murderous atmosphere in the martial arts performance. The girl in pink and long red-clothed body shook all over. When she saw Nian Bing, she excitedly shook her body and almost reached Nian Bing with difficulty in distinguishing it with the naked eye. This girl was the girl of the geese who had just left the dragon cave, \"Nian Bing, are you really you? \"Her calm face was already dampened by the scrub water, and her voice was choked, holding Nianbing's hand tightly with both hands, and her body was shaking slightly due to the excitement.\n\n\n\nThe girl is excited, why is Nian Bing not?At this moment, he could no longer tolerate anyone in his eyes and forgot everything. He suddenly opened his arms and pushed the feather tightly into the skull. The moving skull was shaking slightly in his hug. At that moment, Nian Bing felt that his heart was so full that he had only a girl in his heart, and his feelings could not be suppressed. He knew that in this world, a girl was his first love. If his feelings for Dragon Spirit also contain silence, then his feelings for the peach girl are pure love. Love for no reason. After the pain of separation from life and death, it is either Nian Bing or Feng Girl. In their hearts, the figures of the other party have become clearer, and they are hugging each other without regard for all the tension, feeling each other's heartbeat.\n\n\n\nRu Ying said coldly, \"It seems that I am not the only one of the precedents of the gentry. The two elders and gentry are the two elders, and your ability to restrain the tribe is getting worse and worse.\"\n\n\n\nThe old man on the left, who was called Fenghuang by Yu Ru, had a bright light in his eyes. It was a red light of reality, \"Blonde, what are you doing? Who is he?\"\n\n\n\nThe girl's whole body was shocked. Only then did she remember where she was. She suddenly pushed Nian Bing open, dedicated to her, and said in a low voice: \"Grand elder, Nian Bing is one of my friends. You listen to me to explain.\"\n\n\n\nFengxian's eyes shone brightly. \"My daughter, you should remember the clan rules. I don't need you to explain it. Take action and kill him. Why didn't I even have any birth?\"\n\n\n\nYu Ru smoked and shouted, \"Yin, don't forget that this is not Fengshi Mountain, but my husband's Duke's Mansion. If you dare to kill someone here, don't blame me for being rude to the Fengshi.\"\n\n\n\nFeng said coldly, \"Little Smoke, when your father died, you gave you to us for nourishment. We raised you and conveyed your gentry's absolute learning. However, you betrayed the faith of the tribe and the gentry and combined with a human being. Don't say that boy today, even you and your husband can't be let go. Girl, don't you still act?\"\n\n\n\nFrom the moment the bird girl left, Nian Bing had already come to a clear mind. He carefully observed the situation in the martial arts scene, and listened to the conversation between Yu Ruyi and Fengxian. He had understood many things at the time. He respected Aunt Yu Ruyi, obviously, was a member of the Bi tribe like the Bi tribe. He left the Bi tribe because of the Duke of Blue Feather. At this moment, the eldest son of the Bi tribe brought people to her to trouble her. What a young man who actually lets a young woman kill him. It's so ridiculous. With a smile, he thought he was obsessed with enlightenment, \"Will you kill me?\"\n\n\n\nThe girl's face changed, and her body suddenly flashed and she came back to Nian Bing. She directly printed her chest with her palm. Nian Bing only felt a burning air wrapping her body, flying like a fog of a gust. At the same time, the girl was like a mosquito, \"Don't be put to death soon, otherwise the elders will not let you go. Our geese are no more than the Huolong tribe, so don't go out again.\"The body suddenly hit the yard wall, and Nian Bing's body slid down. At the moment of the collision, the hot air flowed out from behind him, resolving the impulse like a slab, making Nian Bing safe. \n\n\n\nAlthough Nian Bing's heart was shocked, he was so smart that he still did what the girl said. After sliding down to the ground, his eyes immediately closed and he remained silent.\n\n\n\nThe silver air was like a smoke. The girl suddenly felt suffocating. Her heartbeat and shed no hesitation without any hesitation. She had no chance to turn around. She transformed into a fire-red light and shadow, trying to resist the attack that was almost mountainous. The roar of Fengxian rose at the same time, \"Big Bo\"\n\n\n\nThere were several sounds of explosive sounds coming from the martial arts show. Blue Yu stood in the middle of the scene and faced the two elders of the tribe. His chest was undulating, and his breath was a little more effective and even. Yu Ruyi had already arrived at Nian Bing's body and pinched his wrist. The girl with blood was swept over and was taken back by the elders of the old man, and the faces of the elders of the two elders of the old man, had changed a little, which was a shocking look.\n\n\n\nFeng Kong Chang's old eyebrows were slightly browsed and said, \"I haven't seen it for ten years. You are very capable!\"\n\n\n\nYu Ruyi didn't care about Feng Kong Lao, and now that I was thinking about Bing, he said to the three blue people beside him, \"Please protect Bing well, remember the Duke and uncle, and you will definitely not interfere.\" After the explanation,\n\n\n\nIn this sentence, my body flashed and returned to my husband like I moved in an instant, \"It's been ten years since I haven't seen it. If every of our daughters is still alive, she should be almost nineteen now.\"\n\n\n\nAs soon as he heard the sentence Yu Ru smoke, the killing machine was very prosperous in Blue Feather's eyes. The bloody murder machine that had been grinding from the battlefield made the two elders of the tribe shocked. Feng Xiao said coldly: \"It's a pity that she is dead. Xiao Yi, you hid for many years and had a child again. Although you are the daughter of the former eldest son, But the tribe rules that I release my tribe cannot be violated. Today we are here to understand the problem. As long as you kill the man next to you and hand over your other daughter, I can not only allow you to return to the tribe, but also appoint you as the elder of the tribe. You should know how great honor this is.\" \n\n\n\nYu Ruyi's eyes were covered with cold light, \"I know that when I was a child, I became my goal of rainfall for the elders of the tribe. However, now it doesn't matter to me. I only know that you are my female enemy. From the moment you endure the killing of my daughter, I have no relationship with the tribe, but just an enemy. I have never had any grudges when you grew up and taught me the tribe's skills, I did not have any grudges, I never thought that You actually came to the door again to get a shot. Okay, since you have to solve it, let's solve it together today. You four keep going. To avenge your daughter, Brother Yu and I are enough.\" The slender and fair jade hand touched the waist, and a silver-colored light appeared like a spirit snake. It was a silver-colored sword. The sword was silver-colored, and the jade-like wrist was slightly vibrated. The sword became hard, and the sword was swollen in silver. It was useful to ask, it was also a sword.Blue Yu also moved. He was also touched the game. It was also a skeleton, but his skeleton was blue, which was slightly wider than Yu Ruyi's silver sword. The skeleton was straight and pointed at the two elders of the tribe in front of him. \"Do you do it, don't worry, Ruyi and I will never win more.\"\n\n\n\n  Feng. The red light in the eyes of Feng Kong and the two of them was very bright, \"Since that's the case, there is no need to talk. Feng Nu and Feng Xiang, Jiu Lu will go through the sky.\" The red fighting spirit instantly spread, and the hot Jiu Lu Lu Lu's fighting spirit both appeared on the body of the girl of similar age. The two women drank a light sound, rose up into the sky, and brought a Hokage. At this time, Feng Yun and Feng Kong also pulled out the long sword with red color behind them, and the fighting instantly turned into silver. At the same time, they took a step forward and made a simple posture of cutting forward. Although the distance between the drama is not large, there is a sharp sharp sound on the drama, which clearly has increased to the extreme.",

    "content": "Lan Xun and the two others blocked their path. Nian Bing sat against the courtyard wall. By then, he had secretly opened his eyes and happened to see Yu Ruyan and Lan Yu simultaneously unleash silver light from their bodies. Plus the two Phoenix Clan elders—clearly, they were four Martial Saint-level warriors! Nian Bing groaned inwardly. Why did he always encounter such powerful individuals? At that very moment, his heart was filled with a longing for power.\n\nFour swords clashed without any flourish. Battle Qi shattered the air and soared skyward. In an instant, the difference in Battle Qi strength was apparent. Lan Yu was shaken back a step by Elder Feng Xu, while Elder Feng Kong was knocked back two steps by Yu Ruyan. Clearly, the strongest among the four was surprisingly the sole beautiful woman.\n\nSilver light appeared, wind and thunder stirred. At this moment, Feng Nü and Qing Fengxiang had already swooped down. Feng Nü's Divine Sword Litian instantly released a silver glow just as it was about to reach Lan Yu. Lan Yu was visibly startled, and his flexible sword twisted around it. He clashed head-on with Feng Nü. Feng Nü, using the rebound force, elegantly flew up and landed to the side. Fengxiang's situation, however, was not so easy. She faced the strongest Yu Ruyan. Yu Ruyan was now radiating intense killing intent, clearly not holding back. She didn't even spare Fengxiang a glance. Her left hand directly swept upwards, silver Battle Qi surprisingly condensing into a sword shape. It collided with Fengxiang's longsword, emitting a clanging metallic sound. Fengxiang managed to suppress a mouthful of blood. Her body was sent flying high from the shock. If Elder Feng Kong hadn't intervened in time, distracting Yu Ruyan, that strike might have severely wounded her. Feng Nü's strength was unexpected by Lan Yu and Yu Ruyan. Although Lan Yu had sent Feng Nü flying, he was subjected to Elder Feng Xu's storm-like attack. A phoenix cry came from Elder Feng Xu's mouth. The red longsword in his hand, carrying a blur, directly attacked Lan Yu, who had just sent Feng Nü flying. The sounds of clashing Battle Qi and metal constantly resounded. Lan Yu grunted, retreating several steps consecutively. His shirt was torn at the chest, revealing a few traces of blood. His face had already turned somewhat pale.\n\nJust as Feng Xu was about to continue his pursuit, a sheet of silver light suddenly covered his front. Yu Ruyan displayed immense power, her flexible sword circling, surprisingly encompassing both Elder Feng Xu and Elder Feng Kong within her Battle Qi. Clashing sounds continuously rang out. Facing two elders simultaneously, Yu Ruyan did not retreat an inch; a stalemate was formed. Her formidable strength not only greatly surprised the two elders but also made Nian Bing open his mouth in astonishment. He never imagined that this aunt he called \"mother\" would be so powerful. A single Martial Saint facing the attacks of two Martial Saints without falling into a disadvantage. Yu Ruyan's strength could no longer be described merely as \"powerful.\" Level didn't represent everything; even within the same level, there were still distinctions of strength.\n\nA thunderous roar suddenly resounded. Lan Yu, who had been wounded earlier, suddenly underwent a transformation. His upper warrior's attire shredded inch by inch, revealing a body of solid muscle. The sword mark on his chest was clearly visible, but at this moment, a strange blue glow flickered around his body. The bone-deep wound surprisingly healed rapidly. Moreover, Lan Yu's body was continuously expanding. His coiled muscles were like granite. His eyes had turned completely blue. His short hair stood on end. His body expanded by a full circle compared to before. Even his height increased by a few points. His handsome face was filled with a murderous aura. An aura of iron and blood continuously swirled around his body.\n\n\"It's the Thunder Dragon Physique,\" Lan Xun whispered.\n\nNian Bing stood up, asking in a low voice, \"What is the Thunder Dragon Physique?\"\n\nLan Xun looked at the reawakened Nian Bing in surprise, but he still explained, \"Among ancient dragons, there is no such type as a Thunder Dragon. The Duke's Thunder Dragon Physique is actually a form of Berserker State, or rather, an advanced stage of the Berserker State. Through stimulating bodily changes, coupled with mutations between Battle Qi and bloodlines, it multiplies one's defense and physical recovery rate several-fold, and attacks become even more ferocious. Although it leads to a period of weakness afterward, this is the strongest physique a human warrior can possess. The reason it's called the Thunder Dragon Physique is that after transformation, the defense is formidable, and the muscle surface has the effect of dragon scales. And the Duke's Battle Qi is a rare lightning attribute, hence this title. The greatest advantage of this Berserker State is consciousness. The number of ordinary Berserker warriors is extremely small, and after berserking, they can only retain a certain degree of subconsciousness, making it difficult to distinguish friend from foe. However, the Duke's Thunder Dragon Physique can maintain original consciousness; its formidable extent is beyond my comprehension.\"\n\nWhile Lan Xun was describing, Lan Yu had already moved. Although his Battle Qi transformed from a Martial Saint's Saint Battle Qi into blue, its power increased several-fold. He discarded his flexible sword, using his fists as weapons. Each punch unleashed a violent boom, like a bolt from the clear sky. With two consecutive punches, he forced Elder Feng Xu and Elder Feng Kong back.\n\nFeng Xu said coldly, \"Good, your Thunder Dragon Physique has entered its complete state. No wonder you earned such renown within the Olan Empire. However, the real battle has only just begun.\" A resonant phoenix cry came from Feng Xu's mouth. Immediately after, Feng Kong, Feng Nü, and Fengxiang simultaneously emitted the same sound. The four high-pitched and melodious phoenix cries intertwined and soared straight up. The first to transform was Fengxiang. Her hands simultaneously raised to her sides, making movements like wings flapping against her body. Red Battle Qi instantly expanded; even her longsword turned golden-red. Her burning, fiery-red eyes showed no emotion. Her figure flashed, and she was already at the side of Lan Yu and Yu Ruyan.\n\nA hint of surprise appeared in Yu Ruyan's eyes. \"Only in her twenties, yet she has reached the first transformation of the Phoenix Transformation, Phoenix Flame. A very promising young lady. Unfortunately, you are my enemy. When I was your age, my use of Phoenix Flame was only slightly more composed than yours. It seems you must be the Phoenix of Hope for this generation of the Phoenix Clan.\"\n\nFeng Xu sneered, \"Xiao Yan, you are mistaken. Fengxiang is merely the guardian of this generation's Phoenix of Hope; the true Phoenix of Hope is Feng Nü.\" No sooner had he finished speaking than the pair of enormous red wings that had once left a deep impression on Nian Bing appeared, accompanied by Feng Nü, Feng Xu, and Feng Kong simultaneously turning their eyes golden. The massive wings brought scorching currents of air, and the enormous aura instantly forced Yu Ruyan back a step, to stand with her husband.\n\n\"Wings of Royalty.\" Yu Ruyan's eyes met Feng Nü's golden ones, a look of surprise appearing in her gaze. \"You are the Phoenix of Hope for this generation of the Phoenix Clan? How old are you this year?\"\n\nFeng Nü said coldly, \"I am nineteen years old. Traitor of our clan, prepare to die.\" A red light flashed, the Divine Sword Litian burst into a brilliant fire, carrying Feng Nü's body, transforming into a red cloud. Her wings spread wide; at this moment, she truly resembled a fire phoenix as she charged towards Yu Ruyan, her momentum suddenly surging.\n\nSeeing this situation, Nian Bing was somewhat surprised. He had once seen Feng Nü use the Wings of Royalty. At that time, Feng Nü told him she would need to rest for a very long time to recover her former strength. But now it seemed she had not only recovered but could even fully use the second transformation ability of the Nine Phoenix Transformations, with both her attack and defense having improved. What was going on?\n\nYu Ruyan snorted coldly, her figure stepping forward in an instant like a phantom. Leaving an afterimage behind, her flexible sword rose skyward. It directly parried the Litian in Feng Nü's hand. With a *thud*, Feng Nü flew back, caught by Fengxiang. Yu Ruyan, her expression unchanged, looked at the four enemies from the Phoenix Clan before her. \"The Wings of Royalty are still not enough to threaten me, little girl. We are originally clan members; do you truly believe the clan rules are so correct? We are human, why can't we fall in love with other humans?\"\n\nFeng Nü stabilized the churning qi and blood within her body. During their previous exchange, she had deeply experienced Yu Ruyan's Battle Qi, as formidable as a vast ocean. Even with the aid of the Wings of Royalty and Phoenix Flame, she still couldn't shake Yu Ruyan's defense. Hearing her words, Feng Nü couldn't help but steal a glance at Nian Bing. Seeing him standing up again, she became anxious and instantly lost her composure.\n\nFeng Xu and Feng Kong simultaneously let out long cries. The Wings of Royalty on their backs instantly spread wide. Both of them flew up simultaneously, their bodies rapidly burning with golden-red flames. Their silvery-white hair had already turned fiery red. Their golden eyes radiated brilliant light as they simultaneously roared, \"Phoenix—Illusionary—Demonic—Body~~\" Their originally solid bodies seemed to merge into the flames, becoming illusory. Scorching air currents swept forth, immense flames converged in the air, forming a fiery tornado, directly attacking Yu Ruyan and Lan Yu.\n\nYu Ruyan's delicate body transformed into a wisp of smoke, much like her name. The flexible sword in her hand emitted a slight tremor. Lan Yu roared, simultaneously throwing both fists. Two dazzling blue lights, roaring, struck the fiery tornado. A muffled thunder-like roar, amidst the tremors, greatly weakened the fiery tornado. Just as it was about to reach Lan Yu, that ethereal figure, light as a breeze, intercepted the fiery tornado. Silver light instantly surged, the flexible sword in Yu Ruyan's hand was like a blossoming flower, each strike emitting a powerful booming sound. The red and silver lights instantly blurred the consciousness of Nian Bing and the others who were watching. With a booming crash, the ground cracked into fissures radiating from the center of the battle.\n\nThe four separated. Yu Ruyan's full chest heaved continuously, her clothes appearing somewhat disheveled. Lan Yu had to support her arm to barely stand steady. Meanwhile, Feng Xu and Feng Kong were also forced back. They stood in a line with Fengxiang, who was burning with Phoenix Flame, and Feng Nü, who had her Wings of Royalty extended.\n\nYu Ruyan snorted disdainfully. \"Still no progress. Although the two elders have cultivated for many years, their talent is limited. They can probably only reach the Phoenix Illusionary Demonic Body, the third transformation of the Phoenix Transformation.\"\n\nFeng Xu snorted coldly, saying, \"What about you then? If you don't use our clan's Phoenix Transformation, you won't have a single chance. Xiao Yan, I'll give you one last chance: kill the man beside you and return to the clan with us.\"\n\nYu Ruyan snorted coldly, saying, \"That's impossible. Brother Yu is the man I love most. If I could have gone back with you, I wouldn't have left with Brother Yu back then. From the moment you killed my daughter, I no longer acknowledged myself as a member of the Phoenix Clan. Out of respect for you raising me, I have been patient until now. Since you insist on delivering killing blows, don't blame me for not holding back. Let me show you what the true Phoenix Transformation is. Without talent, without good comprehension, even if you cultivated twice as long as I have, you would never be able to defeat me.\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the silver light around her body rippled like flames. Like Feng Xu and the others, the silver light flickered and transformed into golden-red. This was precisely the Phoenix Flame unique to the Phoenix Clan's royalty. A pair of massive wings tore through her clothes and spread outwards. In but an instant, Yu Ruyan completed the second transformation, her speed causing the illusory faces of the two Phoenix Clan elders to change.\n\n\"Brother Yu, this is between me and the Phoenix Clan. Please do not interfere.\" Yu Ruyan's voice was cold, yet filled with confidence. Lan Yu gave her a complicated look, but then his figure flashed, arriving before Nian Bing and the three others, exiting the battle.\n\nFeng Xu asked in astonishment, \"Xiao Yan, are you going to fight one against four?\"\n\nYu Ruyan said proudly, \"And why not? Even if all four of you come at me together, you are absolutely no match for me.\" Her wings flapped lightly, and her body floated off the ground. Her figure swayed from side to side, and an illusory form appeared, precisely the Phoenix Illusionary Demonic Body, the third transformation of the Phoenix Transformation. \"When I left the Phoenix Clan back then, I had only completed the second Phoenix Transformation, possessing the Wings of Royalty. At that time, I was far from your match, so Brother Yu and I could only flee. We didn't even dare to keep our daughter by our side later, fearing we would repeat the same mistake. But now, it's different. I not only have the ability to protect my daughter, but also the ability to destroy you. Elders, if I recall correctly, the most outstanding talents in our clan once cultivated the Phoenix Transformation to its fifth stage. However, for hundreds of years, the Phoenix Clan's royalty could at most only complete the third transformation. Now, I shall show you the fourth transformation.\"\n\nRaising her head, Yu Ruyan let out a long cry to the sky. Golden flames instantly covered a three-zhang¹ radius and soared skyward. The clouds in the sky were completely dyed blood-red under the illumination of the red light. The edges of the red wings on her back shimmered with a faint golden light. Strangely, the seemingly intense flames did not emit a single hint of heat. Only Feng Xu and Feng Kong understood that this was due to the extreme condensation of the flames, with no energy leakage whatsoever.\n\n\"Phoenix—Shadow—Triplication~~\" A red light flashed, and within the golden-red sea of flames, three figures appeared. Three identical illusory Yu Ruyans, with the same fiery-red wings and golden eyes.\n___\n¹ A *zhang* is a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.3 meters or 10.8 feet.",

    "content": "Feng Nü knew that the Third Transformation, Phoenix Illusion Demonic Body, was precisely preparation for the Fourth Transformation, Phoenix Shadow Triplication. The three illusory figures had equally formidable attack power. From the Third to the Fourth Transformation, it was also a qualitative leap in the Phoenix Clan's strength.\n\nFeng Kong's voice trembled slightly as he said, \"The Fourth Transformation, it's really the Fourth Transformation, Phoenix Shadow Triplication. Xiao Yan, you are truly the most outstanding talent of our Phoenix Clan. Give up everything among humans. I will plead with Elder Brother on your behalf. As long as you are willing to return with us, your husband and daughter can be spared.\"\n\nThe three Yu Ru Yans spoke simultaneously, \"Elder Kong, from childhood until now, you have always been the one who cared about me the most. Among the clansmen, you are also the kindest-hearted. Thank you for your good intentions, but as I said, Yu Ge is the man I love most, and I will never leave him. You wouldn't understand.\"\n\nFeng Xu said coldly, \"Kong Di, why bother with her? So what if it's the Fourth Transformation? She might not be able to unleash the full power of Phoenix Shadow Triplication. Although we haven't reached the Fourth Transformation, our years of arduous cultivation in Ninefold Separation Dou Qi are not something she can compare to. Once she uses the Phoenix Illusion Demonic Body, all her previous borrowed power techniques will be useless. Let's attack together; we can surely destroy her.\"\n\nYu Ru Yan snorted coldly, \"Is that what you think? If the Fourth Transformation isn't enough, then what about the Fifth Transformation?\" The golden-red flames instantly receded, and the golden-red light slowly surged. \"The true color of a phoenix is neither red nor gold. According to legend, our ancestor, the Phoenix, possessed the features of a chicken's head, a snake's neck, a swallow's jaw, a tortoise's back, a fish's tail, and colorless feathers. Eight years ago, I finally broke through the Fourth Transformation realm and reached the Fifth Transformation. This is probably something you never imagined.\"\n\nThe first change appeared in the wings behind the three Yu Ru Yans. The original golden-red light rippled with five-colored patterns as it surged, though still based on golden-red. However, the wings, adorned with five-colored light, looked much more magnificent. Yu Ru Yan flicked her wrist, tossing her silver soft sword aside. Her three bodies simultaneously extended their right hands. Five-colored flames condensed in their hands, forming a plume-like object about three feet long from the five-colored light. The three bodies and six wings flapped simultaneously, and an impassioned voice echoed across the land, \"Fifth Transformation. Phoenix—Spreads—Wings—Five—Colors—Move—.\"\n\nThe hearts of Feng Xu and the other three trembled simultaneously. Feng Nü stared wide-eyed at the rebellious elder before her. Within the Phoenix Clan, she was the youngest to achieve the Royal Clan Feather, but she had no confidence at all that she could reach the Fifth Transformation of Phoenix Transformation at Yu Ru Yan's age. The captivating, splendid five-colored light and the exceptionally powerful aura made her feel suffocated.\n\nYu Ru Yan moved. Her three figures simultaneously rushed towards the four people in front of her. The Phoenix Plume in her hand was as elusive as if it were soaring through the nine heavens. Amidst flashing light, a substantial five-colored light enveloped the powerful enemies before her.\n\nAt the critical moment, Feng Xu and Feng Kong, the two Phoenix Clan elders, displayed the achievements of their years of cultivation. Although they were only at the Phoenix Third Transformation, when their Dou Qi fully erupted, it was not weak at all. They barely managed to resist two of Yu Ru Yan's figures, while the other Yu Ru Yan forced Feng Nü and Feng Xiang to retreat steadily. For a moment, eight figures battled in a tangle, making it impossible to distinguish who was who. The surging energy was completely compressed within the narrow space. Golden-red light and five-colored light intertwined, colliding continuously. Each soft explosion made the earth tremble.\n\nThe person with the most complicated feelings in the training ground was not Lan Yu, who had used his Thunder Dragon Body, but Nian Bing. Among the warring parties were the people he cared about most. He was afraid that Yu Ru Yan would harm Feng Nü, and also afraid that Feng Nü and the other three would harm the aunt whom he regarded as a mother in his heart. Subconsciously, he took a step forward, muttering a spell.\n\nA large hand appeared on Nian Bing's shoulder. \"I know you care about Ru Yan, but don't interfere. This is a grievance between Ru Yan and her clansmen. I believe Ru Yan has the strength to defeat them.\" Although it was Lan Yu holding Nian Bing, and despite being in a berserk state, a faint smile still appeared on his face.\n\n\"But...\"\n\n\"No 'buts.' Ru Yan is the most outstanding genius of the Phoenix Clan. At the same time, she is also the top master of our Olan Empire. After the Phoenix Clan used the Phoenix Transformation, even if I were to go in, I might not be able to help Ru Yan much. Just watch, I believe in Ru Yan's strength.\" Although Lan Yu said this, Nian Bing noticed that his solid hands were already clenched into fists.\n\nShould he really just watch until they decided a winner? No matter which side was harmed, it was something Nian Bing didn't want to see. His eyes shone brightly. He retreated to the courtyard wall and suddenly shouted loudly, \"Galamandis, stop watching the show! Get out here and help!\"\n\nLan Yu and the other three looked at Nian Bing in astonishment, not understanding what he was saying.\n\nNian Bing had no intention of stopping. He continued to shout loudly, \"Galamandis, stop hiding! I know you're here. Look, the ground they're fighting on is cracking, and the stove over there is almost broken. If you don't come out and help, I won't have anywhere to cook. Don't you want to eat a meal I've prepared with all my heart?\"\n\nThe eight figures in combat were all fully focused on their enemies, and no one paid attention to Nian Bing. Although Lan Yu, Lan Xun, and the Ruyi sisters saw him shouting, none of them understood the meaning of his words. Just then, an anomaly occurred.\n\nA lazy voice came from all directions, \"Not one meal, but three meals. Remember that, you stinky brat, Nian Bing.\"\n\nA red figure appeared like a ghost, darting into the battle circle—which even Lan Yu was unsure he could enter—like a needle or a wisp of light wind. Violent booming sounds appeared one after another, and the eight figures actually separated one by one after the red shadow appeared.\n\nEverything returned to calm. In the center of the previous battle, Galamandis, dressed in red, floated, a hint of an evil smile on his face, as he looked at the people around him. Yu Ru Yan's three separated figures had reunited. Her face looked very pale, and the Phoenix Plume in her hand was surprisingly only half-remaining. On the other side, Feng Nü, Feng Xiang, Feng Xu, and Feng Kong all had a trace of blood flowing from the corners of their mouths, clearly having been at a disadvantage in the recent battle.\n\nGalamandis's gaze finally rested on Yu Ru Yan. \"Little girl, that plume of yours hurt me quite a bit! Tell me, how will you compensate me? Oh, right. And you few, each one fiercer than the last, trying to tear apart my old bones?\"\n\nWhether it was Yu Ru Yan or Feng Nü and the others, their eyes now revealed a look of horror. Only they, as the direct participants, understood what had just happened. During the fierce battle, they had already deployed formidable Dou Qi around their bodies. Five top Phoenix Clan masters were fighting with all their might; it would likely be difficult even for a Godmaster to intervene. However, this red-clad young man before them easily burst into their battle circle. From the moment he appeared, his hands remained clasped across his chest, and he did not launch any attacks. All he did was use his body to block all attacks from Yu Ru Yan and the others. Yu Ru Yan and the rest clearly felt that what they were attacking was not a human body, but a solid mountain. Yet, even a real mountain would probably be pulverized under such attacks, but this person was unharmed. Not only unharmed, he could now float there and make sarcastic remarks.\n\nLan Yu gasped. \"A Godmaster.\" In his imagination, besides a martial artist at the Godmaster realm, probably no one could have done what just happened.\n\nGalamandis scoffed disdainfully, \"What's a Godmaster? I wouldn't bother with such a title.\"\n\nYu Ru Yan said coldly, \"This is our own business. What right do you have to interfere?\"\n\nGalamandis chuckled. \"I didn't interfere; I merely inserted myself. You descendants of these little phoenix brats seem a bit stronger than the previous generations. Especially you, you could have gone for the kill much earlier, but you deliberately held back, not using your Sixth Transformation. Even without the Sixth Transformation, I remember the little phoenix's five-colored feather also has some Five-Colored Sky Soar technique. Wouldn't it be easy to kill a few of them? However, the Sixth Transformation is also your limit. Unless you have some fortuitous encounter, you'll never reach the Seventh Transformation. It's fine if you fight, but go fight outside. Don't ruin the stove. Nian Bing, don't forget, you must make me three grand meals with all your heart. But, how did you, brat, know I followed you out? With your cultivation, it's impossible for you to detect me.\"\n\nYu Ru Yan was greatly alarmed. This unfathomable young man before her had actually seen through her true abilities. Feng Xu and the others were even more surprised. They, of course, knew about the Sixth Transformation of the Phoenix Transformation. Reaching the Sixth Transformation not only meant that Yu Ru Yan had achieved a half-phoenix body, but also that her strength was infinitely close to the Godmaster realm. As long as she broke through to the Seventh Transformation, she would be a true Godmaster!* Looking at it this way, she had indeed been holding back earlier; otherwise, if she had used the Sixth Transformation, they would have long been unable to resist.\n\nNian Bing walked out with a smile. \"Galamandis, don't worry, I'll definitely do what I promised you. As for how I found you, that's too simple. Although my strength isn't enough to sense your presence, when I was organizing the spices, the sound of your swallowing saliva was so loud, how could I not hear it? I'm not deaf. Aunt Yu, please stop fighting. Since you have no intention of killing them, let them go.\"\n\nGalamandis froze for a moment, his face, uncharacteristically, reddened. He muttered to himself, \"Was it really that loud...?\"\n\nYu Ru Yan barely managed to calm her emotions, smiling faintly, \"Nian Bing, you're worried about your little girlfriend, aren't you?\" As she spoke, she deliberately glanced at Feng Nü. Feng Nü's pretty face flushed, and she immediately lowered her head.\n\nSeeing this, Feng Xu was enraged. With a flick of his wrist, the long sword in his hand, like a meteor chasing the moon, flashed and was at Nian Bing's chest.\n\n\"Damn it, whoever dares to kill him is messing with my stomach!\" The high-quality long sword somehow fell into Galamandis's hand, and only then did Yu Ru Yan step in front of Nian Bing.\n\nGalamandis toyed with the long sword in his hand for a moment, then with a casual flick, the sword instantly turned into molten iron, flowing onto the ground. He coldly looked at Feng Xu and the other three. \"Let me tell you, although this brat Nian Bing isn't some powerful expert, he's my exclusive chef. He's under my protection. Anyone who wants to touch him is messing with my stomach, and anyone who messes with my stomach is my greatest enemy. You've already attacked me just now. Don't blame me for not warning you: with your meager strength, I can turn you all to ashes with a mere lift of my hand.\"\n\nFeng Nü suddenly exclaimed in surprise, \"You, you're that dragon! How is this possible? How did you turn into a human?\" From the moment Galamandis appeared, she found his voice familiar. Coupled with Nian Bing calling out the name Galamandis, and Galamandis's tone of voice, she finally confirmed that the red-clad person before her was the fire dragon from the cave back then. Only he could have blocked their previous attacks with his body, which also explained why Nian Bing was here.\n\n\"A dragon?\" Everyone present exclaimed simultaneously.\n\nGalamandis said proudly, \"That's right, I am the great Fire Dragon King Galamandis. Alright, you few little phoenix brats can scram. Nian Bing, cook, cook! I've been sleeping for two days, and I'm starving.\"\n\nFeng Xu looked at Galamandis with doubt and apprehension for a few moments, immediately judging that this was not a place to linger. Even without this powerful individual, who could transform into a dragon, Yu Ru Yan alone was someone they couldn't handle.\n\n\"Let's go,\" he said, taking the lead and walking outside.\n\nFeng Kong, Feng Xiang, and Feng Nü hastily followed him out of the Duke's Residence. Yu Ru Yan did not stop them, watching them leave with slightly furrowed brows. Nian Bing wanted to call out to Feng Nü, but recalling their earlier conversation and Feng Xu's attitude towards him, he held back. He didn't want to cause any trouble for Feng Nü.\n\n\"Alright, alright. They're all gone. For the sake of my exclusive chef, I'll help you tidy up.\" Yellow light rose around Galamandis's body, and circles of yellow aura continuously merged into the earth. Amidst the shimmering light, the huge cracks from before slowly closed under the effect of this yellow light, and the earth recovered its original form amidst the vibrations.\n\nLan Yu gasped softly, \"Earth Magic.\"\n\nClapping his hands, Galamandis, as if he had done nothing at all, walked straight to a common chair beside the table and sat down, patting his stomach. \"So hungry! Nian Bing, hurry up, hurry up!\"\n\nAlthough Yu Ru Yan hadn't fully understood what was happening, since the other party admitted to being a dragon, she absolutely could not be disrespectful. As a Phoenix Clan member, she naturally knew how powerful the dragons remaining on the Yangguang Continent were. She nodded to Nian Bing and smiled, \"Since this Dragon Senior likes your cooking so much, Auntie would like to try some too, Nian Bing. I'll trouble you with it.\"\n\n---\n* The character \"紳士\" (shēnshì) means \"gentleman,\" but given the context of a cultivation realm immediately following \"神師\" (shénshī), meaning \"Godmaster,\" and the progression of power, it is clearly a typographical error in the original text. It has been translated as \"Godmaster\" for clarity and consistency with the story's power system.",

    "content": "Nian Bing smiled faintly, saying, \"What trouble, Auntie? I was going to cook for you anyway! Please, have a seat, it'll be ready in a moment.\" Forcing down the concern in his heart for Feng Nü, he walked towards the stove. The stove had nearly been reduced to cinders during Yu Ruyan and the others' earlier battle. Fortunately, Galamandis appeared in time, and with the Earth-element magic he cast using mimicry, the ground was restored to peace.\n\nAt this moment, Yu Ruyan, who had been unstable, had calmed down significantly, and a bit of color returned to her pale face. She naturally walked over and sat down beside Galamandis. Lan Yu dispelled his Thunder Dragon form, put on an outer garment, and sat on Galamandis's other side, also having the Ru Yi sisters sit down.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was about to start, Yu Ruyan suddenly asked, \"Nian Bing, how did you come to know that Phoenix Clan girl?\"\n\nNian Bing was startled for a moment, then said, \"You mean Feng Nü? We met in the Ice Moon Empire; it's been about half a year now.\"\n\nYu Ruyan said, \"So that means you also know her identity as a Phoenix Clan member?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, saying, \"She just told me recently.\" As he spoke, he couldn't help but glance at Galamandis.\n\nGalamandis snorted, \"What are you looking at? Hurry up and cook.\"\n\nYu Ruyan looked at Nian Bing with profound eyes and said, \"I can see that she cares a lot about you, and you seem to care a lot about her too. But there's something I must tell you: the Phoenix Clan does not allow intermarriage with outside races. You saw the scene just now; it was because I married Brother Yu that all this trouble came. I don't regret it, but I must warn you: if you truly wish for something to come of it with that girl, you must make yourself stronger. Otherwise, the Phoenix Clan will not permit another Phoenix of Hope to marry a human. Go ahead and cook first, we can talk properly after we eat.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart swelled with joy. As a powerful figure within the Phoenix Clan, if he could learn more about the Phoenix Clan from Auntie Yu, it would undoubtedly greatly benefit his relationship with Feng Nü in the future.* After a slight nod, he once again retrieved the one-meter-diameter large plate from his spatial ring.\n\nAs soon as he saw the plate, Galamandis's eyes instantly lit up. \"Good stuff, truly good stuff! This is meant for me, isn't it? Heh heh.\"\n\nYu Ruyan looked at Galamandis and smiled faintly, \"Judging by your attire, you must be the Fire Dragon Lord residing on the Radiance Continent.\"\n\nGalamandis snorted, \"It's Fire Dragon King, not Fire Dragon. Get it straight.\"\n\nYu Ruyan chuckled, \"Fire Dragon King, then. I've long heard that the Dragon Clan is not only the strongest but also the proudest race, and it seems there's no mistake about it. If there's an opportunity, I'd like to spar a bit with Fire Dragon King.\"\n\nGalamandis glanced at Yu Ruyan and said, \"Spar? No need. Your level is too low. Unless you reach the Ninth Transformation, you don't have the strength to spar with me. However, reaching the Ninth Transformation isn't so easy. A Ninth Transformation 'little broken bird'** has power that directly rivals the Dragon God. You're still too far off. You should know that the final transformations in the Phoenix Transformation are the essence.\"\n\nYu Ruyan nodded, \"I certainly know that. Unfortunately, although I've reached the Sixth Transformation through exploration, the final three transformations are too difficult for me; they are almost impossible to achieve. If I could enter the Seventh Transformation, I could actually transform into a Phoenix Body. Then, even if I couldn't defeat you, a Dragon King, I would at least have the power to contend. Although you are a Dragon King, and possess a proud disposition, you must admit that the Phoenix is actually the most powerful creature on the continent.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! The strongest are us dragons! When would it ever be the turn of a little broken bird?\" Galamandis roared in anger.\n\nYu Ruyan still wore a faint smile. \"Is that truly the case? If my ancestors could match the Dragon Clan in numbers, I wonder if you would still say such things. The Dragon God is indeed powerful, beyond comparison to my ancestors, but someone who has reached his realm can no longer be described as a dragon. And true dragons like yourself cannot contend with my ancestors. Even if you are a Dragon King, you can at most be considered equal to an Eight-Transformation Phoenix, can't you? Your claim that only a Ninth Transformation Phoenix can spar with you seems to be an exaggeration on your part.\"\n\nGalamandis's face reddened. \"Exaggeration my foot! The biggest advantage of those little broken birds is that they're not afraid of mutual destruction. With that skill, of course I'm no match. I'm not like them, who can't even be killed.\"\n\nYu Ruyan didn't provoke Galamandis further, turning her gaze to Nian Bing and nodding at him with a smile.\n\nListening to their conversation, Nian Bing suddenly realized that although Yu Ruyan had left the Phoenix Clan, fundamentally, she still considered herself a member of the Phoenix Clan. Otherwise, why would she argue with Galamandis, who was clearly much stronger than herself, for the dignity of the Phoenix Clan?\n\nGathering his thoughts, Nian Bing suddenly felt somewhat dejected. Compared to these powerhouses, he was truly too far behind. How long would he have to wait to avenge his parents? Ten years—it sounded like a long time, but could he truly reach the strength to contend with the Ice and Snow Goddess in ten years? That was just a dream. Even Galamandis wasn't confident he could defeat her, so what was he? Under the influence of this dejected feeling, the nine cucumbers he had just tossed up landed slightly unevenly in the plate.\n\nGalamandis's senses were extremely keen, and he immediately noticed Nian Bing's abnormal state. He said with dissatisfaction, \"Nian Bing, you brat, I just finished exerting myself for you. You said you'd put all your effort into making me delicious food. You're not going to go back on your word, are you?\"\n\nGalamandis's words startled Nian Bing awake from his dejected state. A cold sensation transmitted directly from his brain to every part of his body. *Nian Bing, Nian Bing, how can you lose heart? No matter how strong the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess is, she cultivated to that level in a human body. For Father, Mother, you must be strong! Pursue a seemingly impossible task,*** even if there's only a one in ten thousand chance, you must never give up—this is your eternal goal!\n\nRaising his head again, Nian Bing's gaze had changed, becoming incredibly firm and persistent. He didn't speak. With his right hand, he directly lifted the large plate. His left hand pressed down on the stove surface, and a cold aura emanated from his palm. Under the effect of Ice Magic, a circular piece of ice instantly condensed on the stove. He quickly placed the plate on the ice, precisely in the center. With a flick of his right wrist, the gentle hum of the Wind of Freedom—the Sky-Shattering Blade—was already in his grasp.\n\nThe free wind, guided by the Sky-Shattering Blade, swirled. Nian Bing's hand moved. With a gentle flick of his left fingertip, a cucumber flew up from the plate. As the cucumber ascended, Nian Bing recalled Tuo Chu Zi Xiu's Emerald Curtain Knife Technique. At this moment, his eyes saw only the cucumber spinning and flying in the air. When the cucumber had just reached its highest point in the air, the Sky-Shattering Blade in his hand moved. A greenish light shimmered from the blade; it was an innate ability of the Sky-Shattering Blade. The wind current left a clear mark on the cucumber, but Nian Bing controlled the force perfectly, just enough not to cut the cucumber in half. At the same time, under the effect of this single cut, the falling cucumber paused in mid-air. It was precisely at that pause that Nian Bing's second cut arrived.\n\nA peculiar scene unfolded: the cucumber, seemingly tossed without a base, hung in mid-air as if suspended. The naked eye could only see the cucumber continuously lengthening, its thinly connected slices slowly drifting towards the plate.\n\nIn just a few blinks of an eye, the front end of the cucumber had reached the center of the plate. The greenish light faded, and the cucumber in mid-air unconsciously began to fall towards the plate. Nian Bing extended two fingers from his left hand, perfectly gripping the cucumber's tail. With a flick of his wrist, the greenish cucumber spun precisely three times, settling steadily onto the plate. The cucumber's head was perfectly curled upwards in the center of the plate, while its tail emerged from the plate.\n\n\"What excellent knife work!\" Yu Ruyan and Lan Yu exclaimed almost simultaneously. Both were masters of martial arts. Although they were confident they could reach Nian Bing's level, they absolutely could not cut each slice of cucumber as uniformly and completely as he did, nor keep the cucumber from breaking. They vaguely sensed that with every cut Nian Bing made, his left hand would emit a cold current, freezing the falling cucumber. Otherwise, with such a tiny connecting point, the cucumber would have probably broken long ago under the force of gravity.\n\nNian Bing seemed to hear nothing. The second cucumber once again flew into the air. Nine cucumbers, nine flights. When everything was complete, the entire one-meter-diameter plate was covered in verdant green cucumber. The greenish light completely disappeared, and the Sky-Shattering Blade vanished into the spatial ring. Looking at his masterpiece, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement. Through the practice of these days, and due to his significant progress in both physical and magical abilities, this cucumber-slicing knife technique had become even more refined. No, it wasn't just due to his body and magic; his consciousness seemed to have improved as well. Although this quick cucumber-slicing method still couldn't compare to Zi Xiu's Emerald Curtain, his culinary skills had greatly improved after that battle with him. His master was right: reading ten thousand books is not as good as traveling ten thousand miles.**** Only by constantly sparring with culinary masters can one's cooking reach higher peaks.\n\nWith a light wave of his right hand, the Ghost Carver transformed into a blue light and leaped into his grasp. A scene from his time at Qingfeng Zhai reappeared in the Duke's mansion: Nian Bing propped his thigh against the edge of the stove, bent his body forward at a ninety-degree angle, and with a flick of his left hand, the entire plate began to spin rapidly. The Ghost Carver, now trembling within his five fingers, had become a ball of blue light.\n\nHaving seen the Wind-element and Fire-element giant dragons afterwards, the impression of dragons as creatures was deeply ingrained in Nian Bing's mind. Without much hesitation, his palm, carrying that faint blue light, was already virtually connected to the very center of the plate. His palm trembled slightly, and not a single person, including experts like Galamandis and Yu Ruyan, could clearly see what he was doing.\n\nNian Bing's left hand was not idle; it continuously sped up the plate's rotation. When the plate reached its fastest spin, he actually closed his eyes. His hand, which had seemed motionless, pressed against the center of the plate, finally moved again, slowly drawing circles above the plate, each circle larger than the last. This time, Galamandis could see a bit more clearly, and a look of surprise couldn't help but appear in his eyes. He realized that for every inch Nian Bing's hand moved, at least dozens of cuts were made into the rapidly spinning plate. Shavings flew around, but everything was incredibly precise. A faint icy mist rose from the plate, carrying the powdered cucumber shavings, forming a layer of greenish mist. The miraculous skill was breathtaking. When Nian Bing's hand reached the outermost circle, the icy mist had already obscured everyone's view. This time, Nian Bing sped up his rotation. After three consecutive circles, his body, bent at a ninety-degree angle, fully straightened.\n\nThe Ghost Carver vanished. A small porcelain bottle appeared in his hand at some unknown point. With a flick of his wrist, white powder integrated into the plate completely enveloped by the greenish mist. With another wave of his right hand, a lychee appeared in his grasp. Nian Bing calmly peeled the lychee, and looking at its flesh, clear and shimmering like ice and snow, he smiled. \"Perfection,\" he could only use these two words to describe his dish.\n\nThe stove surface became damp from the melting ice that had been on the plate's front. Nian Bing's right hand held the edge of the plate, and the spinning finally stopped. But the greenish mist above it still lingered, hazy like a green cloud. If one were to breathe in closely, they would clearly feel a fresh, cool, pastoral scent wafting towards them, exceptionally comfortable.\n\nCarrying the plate, Nian Bing came to the table and carefully placed the large plate in the center. Galamandis said with some dissatisfaction, \"What is this thing you've made? What good taste can nine cucumbers have? No matter how you prepare them, they're still just cucumbers.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled back, \"Galamandis, I'll teach you the first lesson in appreciating fine cuisine. A good food isn't just about good taste; you need to judge its quality from five aspects. Those are: color, aroma, taste, meaning/concept, and presentation/form.***** At the same time, it needs novelty and creativity. Only then is it a good dish. My dish, Nine Green Divine Dragon Ice Cloud Concealment, is precisely such a dish. Oh, right, one more thing I need to teach you: before tasting a dish, never easily conclude whether it's good or bad. After all, you can only truly determine if it's delicious once it's in your mouth, wouldn't you agree?\"\n\nGalamandis was stunned for a moment but still nodded subconsciously. Yu Ruyan, watching from the side, couldn't help but click her tongue in wonder. For such a proud giant dragon like Galamandis to be lectured by Nian Bing without retorting—what a marvel! However, she was now also very curious to see what kind of delicacy was hidden behind that greenish mist.\n\nNian Bing carefully inserted the lychee into the icy mist. With his right hand, he gently stirred the mist, and it immediately scattered in all directions. Everyone seated around the table simultaneously caught the refreshing scent. Each person unconsciously took several deep breaths. Yu Ruyan even seemed to feel her internal injuries alleviating somewhat.\n\n---\n* The original text uses the character '售后' (shòuhòu), typically meaning 'after-sales,' which appears to be a typo for a term meaning 'future' or 'going forward' in this context.\n** \"小破鳥\" (xiǎopòniǎo) literally means \"little broken bird,\" a derogatory but sometimes affectionate term used by dragons for phoenixes.\n*** \"明知不可為而為之\" (míng zhī bù kě wéi ér wéi zhī): To knowingly do what cannot be done; to pursue a seemingly impossible task or fight against impossible odds.\n**** \"讀萬卷書不如行萬里路\" (dú wàn juǎn shū bù rú xíng wàn lǐ lù): A Chinese proverb meaning \"reading ten thousand books is not as good as traveling ten thousand miles,\" emphasizing the value of practical experience over theoretical knowledge.\n***** The \"five aspects\" (色、香、味、意、形 - sè, xiāng, wèi, yì, xíng) are traditional criteria for evaluating Chinese cuisine: color, aroma, taste, meaning/concept (the dish's artistic intent or cultural significance), and presentation/form.",

    "content": "Suddenly, when the azure mist completely dissipated, from the large platter, one meter in diameter, a large burst of dazzling azure light seemed to rise, stimulating everyone's eyes so much that it felt as if the whole world had turned azure. Crystalline light continuously reflected under the sunlight, coupled with the fresh aroma from before, everyone couldn't help but pick up their chopsticks. However, when they saw the food on the platter, not a single person could bear to use their chopsticks to pick up the delicacy.\n\nIt was still the Nine Azure Divine Dragons Hidden in Ice Clouds, but this time it was significantly different from the one at Qingfengzhai. At first glance, in the center of the platter, there were nine emerald green dragons. Their forms varied, each dragon looking different. Perhaps at a quick glance it might seem a bit messy, but upon closer inspection, one would find that their distances and postures were all so harmonious. In the center of the nine dragons, they jointly cradled a crystalline lychee. At this moment, the lychee was like a pearl, exactly the \"Nine Dragons Holding a Pearl\" formation. Extending downwards from the dragons were their bodies—yes, they seemed to be real dragon bodies. The originally sliced cucumbers were actually densely covered with scale-like patterns. Now, they finally understood what the blue light in Nianbing's hand had been doing earlier.\n\nNo one would say anymore that Nianbing had made nine cucumbers; those were clearly nine giant dragons emerging prominently from the mist! The nine dragons were lifelike; although each was not identical in the slightest, one could still feel their harmonious relationship with each other. A flawless dish presented before them was simply a work of art.\n\nGalamandis looked up at Nianbing, deep light shimmering in his eyes. \"Perhaps you are right. A delicacy is not just satisfying in taste; similarly, visual satisfaction is also very pleasant. Nianbing, I've truly learned a lesson here.\" As he said this, he suddenly paused, then gave an awkward, bitter laugh: \"But, no matter how I look at this dish of yours, it seems you want me to eat my own kind! You're not trying to do that, are you?\"\n\nNianbing laughed heartily, saying: \"Didn't you just say that no matter how it's made, they're just nine cucumbers? Since they're cucumbers, what's wrong with eating them? Go ahead, if you don't eat them soon, the flavor will change once the ice aura disappears. Aunt Yu, Duke, please also have a taste.\"\n\nGalamandis was impatient after all; he was still the first to act. Closing his eyes, imagining that they were just nine cucumbers, he reached into the platter and picked up a small section of a dragon's body. Although the cucumbers were closely linked, breaking their connection was incredibly easy. With a gentle squeeze, the cucumber broke, and he directly put it into his mouth.\n\nThe first sensation was a cool chill, followed by an incomparably refreshing aroma. Under the effect of the ice element, the cucumber's fresh sweetness was completely stimulated. Coupled with the powdered sugar Nianbing had sprinkled, the taste was extremely unique. Eating a mouthful of cucumber brought a feeling of ecstasy; everything was so wonderful. Although he had only eaten a small bite of cucumber, Galamandis found that he had reached a sensation he had never experienced before. It was satisfaction, absolute satisfaction. He was full, not his stomach, but his taste buds had completely entered a special state amidst the fresh sweetness, so wonderful. A smile involuntarily appeared on Galamandis's face.\n\nGalamandis's single chopstick also broke the overall atmosphere on the platter. Although there was some reluctance, the other four people present couldn't help but start eating one after another, sending the cucumber into their mouths. Lan Xun could also be considered lucky; he had just rushed back at this moment, and seeing the peculiar cucumbers on the platter, he immediately couldn't resist putting a dragon head into his mouth.\n\n\"Wow, that's so refreshing! This dragon head is really delicious, so cool, such a frosty feeling, and it's so fragrant, a fresh fragrance,\" Lan Xun, having eaten the \"dragon head,\" let out a heartfelt exclamation of praise.\n\nA low voice suddenly rang in his ear: \"What did you just say? Eating dragon head is 'refreshing'?\"\n\nLan Xun turned to look, only to see Galamandis's face right beside him, his eyes filled with a cold aura. Only then did he remember that there was a giant dragon present, and he couldn't help but say awkwardly: \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.\"\n\nGalamandis gave a domineering snort and scooped up the platter. At this point, the others had only eaten a single bite each. He eagerly put all nine cucumbers from the platter into his mouth, one by one, not even leaving the cucumber tails. \"Even if it's eating a dragon, only I can eat it. Hmm, it truly is refreshing, I feel comfortable inside. But Nianbing! I'm a fire dragon, not very interested in these cold things. Do you have anything else delicious?\"\n\nNianbing smiled bitterly, saying: \"Not interested, yet you ate it all. If you were interested, wouldn't you have taken the platter too?\"\n\nGalamandis's face flushed, and he said: \"Alright, you got me. But I've only just realized that you don't necessarily have to eat your fill to feel refreshed; truly delicious food can bring a feeling of satisfaction with just one bite. I can taste that this dish of yours seems to be full of reverence, reverence for my great Galamandis.\"\n\nNianbing said exasperatedly: \"Revere your head! All the dishes I've made today are for Aunt Yu. Who do you think I revere?\"\n\nGalamandis said angrily: \"What? Do you think I'm not as powerful as her? Want to have a fight and see?\"\n\nNianbing frowned, saying: \"What fight? I revere Auntie because Auntie is like my mother. What? Do you want to be my mother too?\"\n\nGalamandis's face instantly changed, as if he had eaten fly droppings, his facial muscles somewhat contorted. \"Mother... Nianbing, I'm going to kill you! You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?\"\n\nNianbing now showed not the slightest fear of Galamandis; he chuckled, saying: \"Kill? Go ahead and kill then. But I must remind you, although I can't compare to you in strength, when it comes to culinary skills, I'm afraid there are few on the entire continent stronger than me. Even mighty experts who are more powerful than me, without magic support, it would be almost impossible for them to create as many variations as I do. Galamandis, don't show me that sour face, you'd be reluctant to kill me anyway.\"\n\nGalamandis was stunned for a moment; immediately afterwards, his expression suddenly turned peaceful. He sat back in his seat, muttering to himself: \"A great person overlooks minor faults; I didn't hear anything.\"\n\nNianbing shook his head helplessly. He found that Galamandis seemed to be getting more and more adorable; whenever food was involved, he was like a child, easily manipulated. His gaze turned to Yu Ruyan and Duke Lan Yu. \"Auntie, what do you think?\"\n\nYu Ruyan smiled, that gentle smile making Nianbing feel as if he had seen his mother again. \"Nianbing, only now do I truly believe that you are a chef, and a top-tier chef who integrates magic into culinary art. Although Auntie has eaten many good things, this is the first time for such delicious cucumber.\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu nodded, saying: \"Indeed, I've eaten many rare delicacies, but this is the first time I've tasted such a unique dish. It's truly amazing how magic can perfectly integrate with culinary art.\"\n\nRuyi and Rumeng, standing nearby, both revealed expressions of surprise in their eyes. Although they had each only taken one bite, Nianbing's culinary skills had left a deep impression on them. Before Nianbing officially demonstrated, none of them believed he was a chef, but now they had no choice but to believe it, because everything was so real. Amazing knife work, dreamlike dishes. All of it proved his words.\n\nNianbing smiled indifferently, saying: \"I am a chef by nature, and my magic serves my culinary art. Auntie, Duke, please continue to enjoy. Today, I've prepared many delicacies for you. The next dish is the opposite of ice, which is fire.\" As he spoke, he had already walked back behind the stove. This time, what appeared was the Roar of the Flame God — Zhengyang Blade.\n\nAs a former member of the Phoenix Clan, Yu Ruyan, who was inherently fire-attributed, was undoubtedly most sensitive to the aura of fire. As soon as the Zhengyang Blade appeared, she immediately stood up from her seat. \"This... this is the aura of the Flame God Stone. Nianbing, how do you have this blade? As far as I know, the Flame God Stone only appeared once on the continent; our Phoenix Clan once tried to intervene and seize it, but failed, and it was...\" Just as she spoke to this point, she saw a strange light flash in Nianbing's eyes; his immense spiritual power seemed to resonate with her consciousness. Her voice halted, and she was immediately unable to continue speaking.\n\nNianbing smiled slightly, saying: \"Auntie, I know all that you're saying, but it belongs to me now, and this blade of mine is named Zhengyang; it's just my kitchen knife.\" With a muffled \"clunk,\" the Roar of the Flame God was plunged into the tabletop. The Flame God Stone, under the control of Nianbing's spiritual power, only emitted a faint glow.\n\nA large pot appeared out of thin air. Nianbing held the pot's rim with his left hand, and with his right hand, took out three large scallions from his Space Ring and placed them on the tabletop. The Zhengyang Blade glowed with red light; the cleaned scallions were transformed into neat segments, laid flat on the tabletop. The blade of the Zhengyang Blade tilted, sending the scallion segments directly into the pot. His right hand moved again, and a prepared wire mesh appeared, its size perfect for resting flat on the pot's surface. Nianbing smiled slightly, saying to those around the table: \"The easiest way to embody the aura of fire is through grilling. This dish was taught to me by my master back then, and it can only be fully unleashed with the aid of fire magic.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a fresh, tender lamb leg appeared in his right hand. He placed the pot on the nearby stove, muttering a few incantations. Scorching flames burst from his palm, going directly into the iron pot. Under the effect of the flames, the entire iron pot turned glowing red, while the scallion segments in the pot were instantly burnt to a crisp under the extreme heat; plumes of thick smoke rose from the pot. The Zhengyang Blade moved; the fresh lamb leg continuously, under the effect of the red light, produced strips of meat, about two fingers wide, that neatly floated down onto the steel mesh on the iron pot. Red light shimmered, and by the time the steel mesh was covered, only the bone of the lamb leg remained in Nianbing's hand. Placing the Zhengyang Blade aside, Nianbing's right hand began to make strange gestures; with each turn of his wrist, a different porcelain bottle appeared in his palm, and powders continuously fell onto the lamb slices on the steel mesh. Without waiting for the iron pot to cool, Nianbing injected streams of scorching flames into it. The Zhengyang Blade moved again, this time, to flip the lamb slices and sprinkle over ten more types of seasonings. The Zhengyang Blade brought forth a fiery red light; those lamb slices were completely lifted, the blade's light vanished, and another large platter appeared. When the lamb slices floated down, they neatly spread across the bottom of the platter. The originally red lamb slices now looked somewhat black, but the rich aroma emanating from them was impossible to conceal. Nianbing walked out from behind the stove, placing the platter on the previous one-meter diameter platter, and smiled slightly, saying: \"Please taste my dish: Ice Fire Nine Heavens - Extreme Fire Scallion-Fragrant Roast Lamb Leg.\" This dish looked very simple, and Nianbing had only used one-third of the time it took to make the Nine Azure Divine Dragons Hidden in Ice Clouds.\n\nGalamandis was just about to snatch the platter, but found Nianbing's Zhengyang Blade placed horizontally in front of him. \"Great Galamandis, if you want to taste the essence of this dish, you can only eat one slice. Eating more will prevent you from finding the true sensation. In this roast lamb leg, there are a total of eighty-one variations of flavor. Try to taste how many you can discern.\"\n\nGalamandis was stunned for a moment, then retracted his hand. He used his chopsticks to pick up a slice of lamb from the platter and put it into his dragon mouth. Yu Ruyan and the others also each picked up a slice with their chopsticks. Even without eating, the rich aroma had already made their mouths water. Nianbing did not conceal the gamy odor of the lamb; instead, he completely brought out its essence. As soon as the lamb entered his mouth, there was a spicy aura; immediately, the rich scallion fragrance mixed with the gamy taste of the lamb exploded. A strong aromatic sensation, accompanied by a fiery feeling, filled everyone's senses. The lamb slices were about one-third of an inch thick, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside; the flavors of the seasonings were perfectly integrated. With each chew, the aroma seemed to change; Nianbing's claim of eighty-one variations was not an exaggeration. It was a deliciousness that made one want to linger forever. Compared to the sweet and refreshing Nine Azure Divine Dragons Hidden in Ice Clouds, this dish was like a scorching flame. Although the spicy taste greatly stimulated the taste buds, the rich aroma filled them with appetite.",

    "content": "Seeing the satisfied and surprised expressions of the crowd, Nian Bing smiled slightly, \"Although this dish looks very simple, it's not easy to make. Similarly, magic is the foundation of this dish. I put scallions in an iron pot, but no oil. When the pot is intensely heated by fire magic, the scallions soften, releasing their aromatic essence. At this point, the lamb is spread flat on top, and with the addition of chili powder, cumin powder, salt, and a powder made from nine kinds of medicinal herbs, the lamb's natural aroma is perfectly preserved. The most crucial part of this dish is actually the process of me slicing the lamb. Each time the Zhengyang Blade cuts a slice of lamb, the fire elements on the blade will undergo nine changes under my control, causing different amounts of fire elements to attach to the lamb at one-inch intervals, from shallow to deep. This creates more variations when smoked and roasted by the onion vapor. The lamb fat renders out under intense roasting, making the aroma even richer. To be precise, the variations in this Extreme Fire Scallion-Fragrant Roasted Lamb Leg are more than eighty-one kinds. Lamb itself has nourishing properties, making it most suitable for this kind of weather, with benefits for qi and vitality. Don't be shy, everyone eat the rest.\"\n\nHearing Nian Bing's last sentence, Galamandis realized he had been tricked. However, when he tried to snatch more, there was only one piece left for him on the plate. But he had to admit that what Nian Bing had said earlier made some sense; only by savoring it carefully could he truly perceive the variations of this roasted lamb leg. The satisfaction of his taste buds kept him from getting angry, and he waited for Nian Bing's next dish.\n\nWalking back to the stove, Nian Bing took a deep breath. At this moment, even he himself was immersed in the process of cooking. Although he hadn't eaten, seeing the satisfied expressions of Yu Ruyan and the others after they finished consuming his food, his heart felt equally content. After all, as a chef, having one's dishes acknowledged by others is the most fulfilling feeling.\n\nThe Aotian Blade once again leapt into his hand. Nian Bing said, \"Today I've prepared nine dishes. The first four dishes each have a unique characteristic. The first dish embodies the essence of ice, and the second is the ultimate expression of fire. After tasting the rich and spicy flavors, I'm sure your taste buds have been considerably stimulated. Now, I'll use the freedom of wind to help cleanse away the heat.\" Although the first dish, Nine Azure Divine Dragon Ice Cloud Concealment, used the Aotian Blade and Ghost Carving Divine Blade, what it wielded was the characteristic of ice. But at this moment, using the Aotian Blade again truly represents the essence of wind.\n\n\"Ice of extreme frost, fire of searing heat, I invoke you, diametrically opposed in essence. Wind of freedom, hear my call, condense within space, and unleash your unbound essence.\" As the incantation was chanted, first appeared red and blue light. The red and blue lights subtly resonated as they intertwined. Suddenly, the light transformed into a red and blue magic circle that gently floated into Nian Bing's body. The Aotian Blade in his hand, humming with the wind of freedom, was raised high, suddenly emitting a strong azure light. The gem at the hilt of the blade shone like a brilliant star. All other magical elements in the entire courtyard were completely replaced by wind elements. Wisps of fine azure light continuously converged towards Nian Bing, and the essence of wind rapidly rotated around his body under his command, guided by the Aotian Blade. That was the true essence of wind.\n\nLan Yu and Yu Ruyan were both somewhat bewildered. They exchanged glances. They wondered what kind of magician Nian Bing truly was, transitioning from ice initially, then to fire, and now transforming into wind. All of this revealed a peculiar nature. In their minds, Nian Bing, who was both a magician and a chef, was full of mystery.\n\nThe Aotian Blade in Nian Bing's hand made an upward flicking motion. Guided by the blade, the vortex spinning around his body transformed into a small tornado that leapt onto the kitchen counter. The azure wind spun rapidly, causing Nian Bing's golden hair to stream backward, making him appear even more handsome against the backdrop of his silver dragon robe. Mimicry. He was using mimicry. However, his mimicry magic was vastly different from Galamandis'. Galamandis had once carefully instructed him based on his situation: to use magic of other elements, one first needs to understand the structure and characteristics of various magical elements. In essence, one must have the root to draw upon these magics, and drawing upon other elements is an extremely difficult task. Galamandis, relying on his dragon body, could achieve it simply by being a Fire Dragon. However, for Nian Bing, it required two processes: using the mutually repellent energies of ice and fire from the same origin as the foundation, combined with the activation from a peerless treasure blade, only then could mimicry be accomplished. Although his mimicry magic was much more difficult to cast and consumed a large amount of magical power, it had one advantage: the mimicked magic would always be only one rank lower than his ice and fire magic. Nian Bing was ecstatic when he first successfully performed mimicry magic. In the days since, he had been constantly pondering the applications of mimicry magic, not just in combat, but also in his culinary skills. And today was his first time using mimicry magic for cooking. What appeared now was precisely the power of wind. Wind is freedom. Only by fully unleashing its free characteristic can the effect of wind truly be displayed.\n\nLooking at the 5th-rank wind magic, Free Tornado, which he fully controlled before him, Nian Bing did not hesitate. To maintain this magic, his magical power was being consumed every moment, and time did not allow him any hesitation. The Spatial Ring was removed from his right hand and placed on his left. With a gesture from his left hand, a cucumber appeared first. The Aotian Blade in Nian Bing's right hand transformed into a three-foot-diameter azure light sphere. The cucumber was directly tossed into this azure light sphere. Immediately after, a wisp of fine cucumber shreds floated out from the blue light. Without Nian Bing needing to consciously control it, the azure wind spinning on the kitchen counter had already whisked these cucumber shreds into itself. Next appeared a carrot. Nian Bing's action was the same, and the carrot also turned into fine shreds. After that, onions, green peppers, green radishes, plus six kinds of green vegetables, swiftly blended into the whirlwind. The originally azure whirlwind became brightly colored due to the intermingling of the vegetable shreds, appearing extremely striking.\n\nSmall porcelain bottles appeared one by one in Nian Bing's hand. These were all sauces he had prepared. The first used was a bottle of red liquid. The liquid scattered and was swept into the tornado. It did not spread out; instead, it was completely concealed within the whirlwind. Next was a golden yellow liquid, followed by a small amount of powder and grain. Nian Bing's movements stopped.\n\nThe Aotian Blade returned to its calm state from the light sphere, and the azure light receded. The whirlwind, under Nian Bing's command, lifted from the kitchen counter, and another large plate appeared. When the clear wind stopped spinning, vegetable shreds slowly drifted down from the sky as if colorful rain were falling. The plate in Nian Bing's hand trembled slightly. Not a single shred of vegetable was left behind, and when all the shreds had fallen, they perfectly filled the plate. He walked out from behind the stove and placed this plate on top of the previous one containing the roasted lamb leg, smiling slightly. \"Please taste, 'Ice and Fire Nine Heavenly Rushes - Wind Demon Dance of Chaos'.\"\n\nGalamandis said with some doubt, \"Nian Bing, this dish seems a bit inferior compared to the previous two, doesn't it? It's just some raw vegetable shreds. What's so special about it?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"This dish is mainly for refreshing the palate. If there's anything special about it, it's the two sauces I added. Those are the fruits of my master's decades of immersion in culinary arts. When he taught me, he said that these were the true treasures. I used the Free Tornado to perfectly blend these vegetable shreds with the two sauces, along with a small amount of powder and grain, so that every single shred could be evenly moistened by the seasoning, and furthermore, infused with some of the wind elements' essence. It has unique characteristics. Although it looks simple to make, it's far from easy. The two sauces I used weren't freshly mixed yesterday; I brought them with me when I left my master. To truly make these two sauces, it takes at least several months to succeed.\"\n\nGalamandis looked at Nian Bing in surprise and asked, \"You're talking about them so mysteriously, what exactly are those two sauces of yours?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"Vinegar and soy sauce, used for cold dishes.\"\n\n\"What?\" Galamandis looked as if he had been pranked. \"Nian Bing. Are you bluffing me? Even though I'm not human, I know that soy sauce and vinegar are the most basic seasonings for you humans. You're talking about just soy sauce and vinegar so mysteriously, are you deliberately trying to deceive me?\"\n\nNian Bing said proudly, \"Do I need to deceive you? You are not human, so you don't understand humanity's great culinary culture. Your Grace, you are a member of Olan Empire's upper echelon. I wonder if you have heard of Ghost King Soy Sauce and Red Soul Vinegar?\"\n\nLan Yu's heart stirred. A look of surprise appeared in his eyes. \"Are you talking about the Ghost King Soy Sauce and Red Soul Vinegar that are more valuable than gold?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. Lan Yu thought for a moment and said, \"When I was young, I once heard that there were two such seasonings on the continent, made through extremely special processes. Even the most ordinary food would become a delicacy of the world if either of these two seasonings was added. Ghost King Soy Sauce and Red Soul Vinegar are also known as Purple Gold Soy Sauce and Diamond Vinegar. It is said that a small bottle of such soy sauce or vinegar is worth hundreds of purple gold coins, and they are also priceless yet unmarketable. They are the delicious seasonings most desired by all nobles on the continent, and the ultimate cooking ingredients most longed for by all chefs. It seems only one chef could make these two seasonings. That chef once received the title of Chef God for five consecutive terms, and his culinary skills were unrivaled through ancient and modern times.\"\n\nNian Bing gave a self-deprecating laugh. \"If he truly was unrivaled through ancient and modern times, he wouldn't have lost. Although he lost due to carelessness, he still lost. From then on, he completely withdrew from the culinary world, living out his retirement in the mountains, and even until his death, he was still thinking about how to reach the pinnacle of culinary art. Your Grace, the person you are referring to is precisely my teacher, the Ghost Chef, once the leader of the five Chef Gods of the continent.\"\n\nSilence. The entire training ground was deathly quiet, and everyone's gaze fell upon Nian Bing. After a long moment, Yu Ruyan finally said, \"Is this Ghost Chef the one I saw last time?\"\n\nNian Bing slowly nodded and said to Galamandis, \"Do you still think this vinegar and soy sauce are ordinary now? They are the crystallization of my master's many years of research, and his proudest treasures. My master is gone, and on this entire continent, only I know how to make Ghost King Soy Sauce and Red Soul Vinegar. Perhaps this dish isn't precious in itself, but it is unique.\"\n\nGalamandis said dumbfounded, \"Since they are both soy sauce and vinegar, what's the difference between yours and ordinary ones?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly, \"Ordinary soy sauce and vinegar are made through fermentation, but what my master developed is not. As for the exact method, it is a secret that cannot be passed on, so I cannot say.\"\n\nGalamandis picked up his chopsticks and murmured to himself, \"Then I must try what's so good about your soy sauce and vinegar.\" Led by him, everyone picked up their chopsticks and tasted the Wind Demon Dance of Chaos made by Nian Bing. The various vegetable shreds were mixed together. Upon tasting, they were crisp. The different aromas of various vegetables brought a unique sensation. As soon as the dish entered the mouth, it was as if wind was flowing, subtly salty, subtly sour, and subtly sweet. None of the flavors were intense, but combined, they were surprisingly harmonious. When a mouthful of vegetables was swallowed, the lingering taste was umami. Yes, it was an umami flavor, as delicious as having just eaten prime seafood. Galamandis discovered that even the Snow Fish Soup he had drunk before couldn't compare to this umami flavor, yet there wasn't a hint of seafood's fishy smell. It was such an captivating sensation. The umami completely dispelled the heatiness from the roasted lamb leg, filling his taste buds in such a miraculous way. Were these still ordinary vegetable shreds? No, they weren't. Nian Bing was right. Although this dish looked the simplest, its flavor had already surpassed the previous two. There was only one explanation: the miraculous application of Ghost King Soy Sauce and Red Soul Vinegar.\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly, \"Galamandis, how does it feel?!\"\n\nGalamandis's face reddened. \"This, how can this thing taste so savory? Your soy sauce and vinegar are indeed good. Can you give me some?\"\n\nNian Bing said irritably, \"No. Giving them to you would be a terrible waste. Without proper application, even the best seasonings are useless. Ghost King Soy Sauce and Red Soul Vinegar are most suitable for preparing two kinds of food: one is cold mixed vegetables, and the other is as a dipping sauce for seafood, by which I mean for dipping, not for direct cooking. You'll have a chance to taste them again in the future.\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu laughed. \"I truly didn't expect that I would have the good fortune to taste the flavor of such a lost seasoning, Nian Bing! Now I both want you to keep cooking and want to stop you. Because, if I eat any more of your food, I'm afraid nothing else will ever taste delicious again.\"",

    "content": "Nianbing smiled faintly: \"Food itself has its own distinct flavors. Eating simply to fill your stomach and eating for the sake of deliciousness are fundamentally two different concepts. Please rest assured, Duke, after you've tasted my cooking, you will only become more interested in fine cuisine. If there's an opportunity in the future, I will certainly cook for you again. Please enjoy this 'Wind Demon's Dance' for now; I will prepare the final dish.\"\n\nReturning to the stove, Nianbing took out a lidded pot from his Secluded Ring. The lid was tightly sealed. He placed the pot on the table, then picked up the iron pot previously used for smoking the roasted lamb leg. His left hand condensed a large block of ice, using it to remove the burnt scallion bits from the iron pot, then melted the ice into water, thoroughly cleaning the iron pot. Placing the iron pot flat on the stove, Nianbing retrieved a small oil gourd from his Secluded Ring and added a little oil to the pot. Holding the iron pot, his left hand ignited a ball of flame to heat it from below, while his right hand gently shook the iron pot, ensuring the added oil evenly coated the bottom. Various sauces and seasonings entered the pot one after another. As they cooked in the hot oil, a rich aroma immediately burst forth. The liquid in the iron pot turned golden. Finally, Nianbing added three drops of red vinegar to the liquid before stopping the heat and setting the iron pot aside. A clean plate, one chi (a unit of measurement, roughly 1/3 of a meter) in diameter, appeared from his Secluded Ring and was placed flat on the table. Glancing at the scalding sauce, Nianbing drew out his Pure Yang Blade.\n\nUsing the hilt of his Pure Yang Blade, he propped up the previously retrieved sealed lidded pot. Nianbing had sealed this pot by melting the edges of the lid with fire magic, making it utterly airtight. Muttering a few incantations, the Flame God Stone radiated a brilliant red light. A stream of red aura, carrying an unusually scorching heat, enveloped the entire pot. In mere moments, the pot began to tremble slightly; the liquid inside was already boiling. Nianbing let out a loud shout, and flames surged abruptly, actually lifting the entire pot into the air. This lidded pot had turned fiery red, and as the liquid inside continuously churned, the lidded pot subtly began to expand. A glint flashed in Nianbing's eyes. With a wave of his left hand, enveloped in a faint golden glow, the enormous Sacred Radiance Blade appeared. His right hand, wielding the Pure Yang Blade, pushed upwards. Amidst the embrace of flames, the lidded pot flew high into the air. At this moment, the pot's volume had expanded by one-tenth compared to before. The Pure Yang Blade vanished. Nianbing held the Sacred Radiance Blade with both hands, gazing at the pot suspended in the air by flames, and chanted: \"Extreme frost, scorching fire, by your opposing essences as guide, oh dawn that pierces heaven and earth! Release your sacred light, baptize all sins in time, release, Holy Light!\"\n\nThe Sacred Radiance Blade was held high with both hands. The Sacred Radiance Stone on its hilt emitted a blinding golden light. A massive golden pillar of light, ten meters long, shot out from the blade's edge directly into the sky. Just then, the flames in the air vanished, and the lidded pot began to fall. Nianbing used his arm to guide his hand, and his hand to guide the blade. His body half-turned, and the ten-meter-long golden blade light instantly swept across the air, directly cleaving the lidded pot.\n\nUnder the effect of steam, the lidded pot was already on the verge of collapse. As the golden blade light swept past, with a thunderous roar, countless droplets of liquid scattered in all directions. The Sacred Radiance Blade in Nianbing's hand transformed into a golden glow, preventing a single drop of scalding liquid from falling on him. With a turn of the blade, something appeared at its tip – the object that emerged after the pot exploded. Garamendis, Yu Ruyan, and Lan all had excellent eyesight and clearly saw that it was an abalone, a colossal abalone, precisely a premium \"one-headed abalone.\" At this moment, this one-headed abalone was completely enveloped in the golden light at the tip of the Sacred Radiance Blade. Nianbing flipped his wrist, transferring the abalone into the prepared plate. With his left hand, he held the Sacred Radiance Blade inverted, while his right hand picked up the iron pot and poured the seasoned sauce over the abalone. Immediately, the abalone turned completely golden under the sauce. Nianbing let out a soft \"heh.\" The Sacred Radiance Blade's light swirled, and the abalone on the plate was instantly divided into six equal portions. The sauce flowed into the cuts. He then inverted the blade, aiming the Sacred Radiance Stone on its hilt at the abalone. Golden light completely enveloped the plate, and gentle light elemental energy, under Nianbing's control, continuously circled around the plate. The blade light receded. Nianbing carried the plate to the table and placed it into the empty \"Wind Demon's Dance\" dish, smiling at the astonished crowd: \"Please savor this, 'Ice and Fire Nine-Tier Heaven: Radiant Abalone with Original Sauce'.\"\n\nThe six people seated around the table remained silent. Each picked up a piece of abalone with their chopsticks and put it into their mouths to chew. The moment the abalone entered their mouths, they immediately felt a rich aura of light. The abalone's freshness, combined with the thick sauce and the flavor infused with light, made their minds exceptionally serene, allowing them to deeply appreciate the deliciousness of this Radiant Abalone with Original Sauce.\n\nNianbing smiled faintly: \"This 'Radiant Abalone with Original Sauce' uses Light magic as its primary cooking method, supplemented by Fire magic. Yesterday, I finally managed to acquire this one-headed abalone and immediately sealed it in the lidded pot with purified water. Abalone usually requires three days of soaking, but during my earlier cooking process, I used a high-pressure method to fully rehydrate and instantly cook it. This way, the abalone's original flavor is preserved. Combined with the baptism of light aura and my specially prepared premium abalone sauce, this delicacy was created. Perhaps anyone can make an abalone with original sauce, but infusing it with Light magic can better bring out the abalone's deliciousness. When one's mind is calm and peaceful, the resilient abalone, with its nutritional value and fresh taste, becomes the finest seafood.\"\n\nAfter eating the abalone, Yu Ruyan looked at Nianbing with a puzzled expression. \"You've made four dishes, used four types of magic, and all of them are exquisite delicacies, Nianbing. Can you tell Auntie which school of magic you learned? I'm fifty-two this year, and I've never heard of any mage capable of using more than two types of magic. Even dual-constitution humans are extremely rare.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly: \"Auntie is right. Dual-constitution humans are already very rare. Even if someone truly possessed three constitutions, they would likely find it very difficult to cultivate due to the conflicting nature of magic. I myself am dual-constitution, possessing both ice and fire essences simultaneously, and I cultivate Ice-Fire Dual-Origin Magic. As for the wind and light you observed, I simulated them using my Ice-Fire Dual-Origin in conjunction with my magical blades. They are merely simple applications. All of this is thanks to the great Garamendis; without his guidance, I would never have progressed so quickly.\"\n\nA surprised glint appeared in Yu Ruyan's eyes. Lan Yu, beside her, said, \"The last two spells you cast earlier must have been fifth-tier or higher. Judging by the intensity of these two spells, you should already possess strength close to that of an Archmage, Nianbing. You are the most talented mage I have ever met. Given time, you will surely carve out a piece of sky for yourself on the continent.\"\n\nNianbing offered a faint smile. Facing this high-ranking official of the Orlan Empire, he had no desire for them to know too much about him. He naturally understood that Duke Lan Yu wanted to recruit him, but his ambitions did not lie there, and even with Yu Ruyan's influence, he could not agree. Nianbing was a very strong-willed person. He knew exactly what he should do and when, and he would never forget his ultimate goal. \"Duke, I am a person who takes things as they come. I don't have grand ambitions; it's enough for me to simply become the best chef.\"\n\nGaramendis let out a long breath. \"Delicious, truly delicious. Nianbing, I now understand some of the mysteries of flavorful food. Sigh. It seems devouring food is truly squandering heaven's gifts! You, whatever Duke, rein in your thoughts. Nianbing is my exclusive chef; he won't do anything else besides cooking for me.\"\n\nYu Ruyan's brow furrowed slightly as she said, \"Elder Fire Dragon, if I recall correctly, when your kind remained on the continent in ancient times, the Dragon God commanded you not to casually harass humans, did he not?\"\n\nGaramendis snorted. \"I haven't harassed any humans. Nianbing attacked me first. I already had the right to kill him; he's using his culinary skills to repay his life, which is already a great bargain.\"\n\nYu Ruyan was about to say more, but Nianbing stopped her. \"Auntie, I am willingly cooking for Garamendis.\" Hearing this, not only were Yu Ruyan and Duke Lan Yu somewhat startled, but even Garamendis himself was stunned. As the Fire Dragon King, he could naturally sense the genuine sincerity in Nianbing's words, knowing they were not spoken merely to flatter him.\n\n\"Please wait a moment. The remaining dishes are made by fusing several types of magic. Their flavors will be more complex, and there will be more variations. However, sometimes I feel that such blended flavors are not as direct as a single flavor.\" As he spoke, Nianbing returned to the stove. He now had his own thoughts. When he was first controlled by Garamendis, he spent every day pondering how to break free from this Fire Dragon King. However, he no longer thought that way. Firstly, as their time together increased, Nianbing discovered that Garamendis was not as terrifying as he had imagined. He even helped Nianbing improve his abilities; with Garamendis's assistance, Nianbing's strength had made a qualitative leap in a short time. Secondly, Garamendis was arrogant and extremely intelligent, but he had a weakness: food. As long as his appetite was satisfied, everything would become much easier. As long as he was eating, even if Nianbing's attitude towards him was a bit poor, he would accept it. With food as his leverage, being with him was not a difficult thing. Not only would Garamendis not control Nianbing's actions, but he could also become his best teacher. One must know that on the entire continent, the only human whose strength level was comparable to Garamendis was probably that Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess. If Nianbing wanted to find the Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess to avenge his parents, he didn't necessarily have to follow Garamendis around. Fully learning the Mimicry Art and making significant progress in magic would be his best choice. Having witnessed the powerful strength of Yu Ruyan, Feng Nü, and others, Nianbing knew how insignificant his own strength was. In culinary arts, he had already reached the pinnacle, but in magic, he still had a very long way to go. Only the Fire Dragon King Garamendis could provide him with the best assistance.\n\nFor the remaining five dishes, Nianbing no longer prepared them one by one as before. Instead, he began working on all five simultaneously. The preparation of ingredients left everyone dazzled. Completely focused on his cooking, Nianbing seemed to have grown eight arms; his speed was breathtaking. Yet, amidst the constantly flickering magical lights, everything appeared incredibly orderly. His self-understood and utilized Profound Jade Hand (Breaking Water to Protect the Surface), his naturally adept Ruyi Hand (Muscle-Separating, Bone-Dislocating), the Dragon Plume Gathering Dance Blade Art, the half-mastered Jade Curtain Graceful Blade Art, and his various insights into culinary arts were all fully displayed with fervent emotion.\n\nRed, blue, green, and golden four-colored magical lights were displayed to their fullest under his focused concentration. Various strange aromas, previously unheard of by Yu Ruyan, wafted into their noses as magic and culinary art combined. When the final five \"Ice and Fire Nine-Tier Heaven\" delicacies were fully presented before everyone, centered around the Nine Dragon Supreme Cauldron, everyone present understood that Nianbing's culinary skills were absolutely more than just magic; his intrinsic technique had reached an extremely high realm. After all, as the successor of the Ghost Chef, how could his cooking be anything but exceptional?\n\nEveryone, including Garamendis, meticulously tasted the delicacies before them, which resembled works of art. Nianbing quietly introduced them from the side. Half an hour later, when all the food had been cleared, everyone realized that Nianbing, who had toiled for half the day, hadn't eaten a single bite. Yu Ruyan praised, \"Nianbing, this is the best meal I have ever had in my life. Thank you.\"\n\nNianbing lowered his head, then after a long pause, looked up and said, \"Auntie, ever since our meeting more than seven years ago, your gentle smile has always warmed my heart, and your Heavenly Splendor Token saved my life. My birth mother is no longer here, and I have always regarded you as a mother. When I was learning to cook with my master, I already had a wish: that after my culinary skills matured, I could prepare a delicious meal for you. Now, that wish has been fulfilled. Auntie, I must leave with Garamendis. Please take good care of yourself in the future.\"\n\nYu Ruyan stood up and walked over to Nianbing. Looking at the handsome young man who was half a head taller than her, her heart couldn't help but feel a surge of warmth. She was originally a proud person, but Nianbing's genuine emotions deeply moved her. She took Nianbing's hand and said, \"Child, since your mother is gone, from now on, you can treat Auntie as your mother. Would you be willing to be my child?\"\n\nFeeling the warmth radiating from Yu Ruyan's hand, Nianbing's heart filled with joy. He knelt down with a thud, his voice trembling slightly as he said, \"I am willing, Mother! I finally have a mother again!\" His long-held longing for his mother burst forth instantly, and tears streamed down his face. Yu Ruyan pulled a clean white handkerchief from her embrace, helped Nianbing to his feet, and gently wiped the tears from his face. \"Good child, don't cry. Mama will treat you just like she treats Chenchen. The Duke and I have always regretted not having a son, but unexpectedly, today we gained two sons.\"",

    "content": "Lan Yu stood up amidst hearty laughter. \"Good, good, good. Nian Bing, from now on, this is your home.\"\n\nYu Ruyan gave Nian Bing a look. Nian Bing had only intended to acknowledge Yu Ruyan, but out of deference to her, he could only brace himself and, somewhat awkwardly, called out, \"Godfather.\"\n\nYu Ruyan glanced at Galamandis, then said to Nian Bing, \"Are you in a hurry to leave today? Do you have anything important to do? Why not stay in the mansion for a few more days?\"\n\nNian Bing also looked at Galamandis, his gaze questioning. Galamandis stretched comfortably and said, \"Don't look at me, I don't care. As long as there's good food.\"\n\nYu Ruyan smiled faintly, \"Olan City is, after all, the capital of the Olan Empire. There are some famous local delicacies worth tasting, so why don't you all stay for now. Lan Xun, please arrange rooms for Nian Bing and the others.\"\n\nGalamandis yawned, \"How come I'm a bit sleepy after eating my fill? Nian Bing, I'm going to sleep first. Just call me when it's time to eat.\"\n\nNian Bing thought to himself, *Eat your fill and then sleep, aren't you a pig?* However, he also hoped Galamandis would leave for a bit, as there were many things he still didn't quite understand and wanted to ask Yu Ruyan. Galamandis departed under Lan Xun's guidance. The sisters Ruyi and Rumeng, delighted, excused themselves and followed. At this moment, Ruyi was no longer cold; a hint of shyness could be seen on her pretty face from time to time.\n\nYu Ruyan beckoned Nian Bing, and together with Lan Yu, led him back to the study. After closing the door, she pulled Nian Bing to sit down. \"Child, we've only met twice. Can you tell Mom about yourself?\"\n\nPerhaps because of Yu Ruyan's kind and gentle voice, Nian Bing's emotions were particularly fragile today. His eyes reddened, and he slowly nodded, saying, \"Mom, I'm originally from the Huarong Empire.\"\n\nYu Ruyan showed no surprise. Stroking Nian Bing's golden hair, she smiled, \"Gold is indeed the symbol of the Huarong Empire. However, the eyes of Huarong Empire citizens are mostly brown, which you don't quite resemble.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"I'm a mixed-blood. My mother is from the Bingyue Empire, and my father is from the Huarong Empire. Due to some special circumstances, they were separated. My father trained diligently in magic to rescue my mother. However, when I went with my father to save her, we found the gap between us and our enemies was so vast that not only did we fail to rescue my mother, but my father was also captured by the enemies. Only I managed to escape overseas by using a spatial magic scroll my father had prepared beforehand. I was only ten years old then, and under the enemies' pursuit, I had no choice but to leap into the swift Tianqing River. Luckily, I was fortunate enough to grab a large log and happened to drift right into the fishing net my master had laid out, which is how I survived. My magic was taught by my father when I was young. Later, I don't know why, but ice magic appeared in addition to my original fire magic. I could only grope my way through cultivation. It wasn't until I met Galamandis that I finally found some direction and truly entered the realm of Ice and Fire of the Same Origin.\"\n\nYu Ruyan sighed softly, \"Child, do you have some unspoken difficulty? Why don't you name your enemies? Since I've adopted you as my son, your vengeance is naturally mine.\"\n\nNian Bing slowly shook his head. His tone firm, he said, \"No, Mom, I cannot implicate you. My enemies are powerful, but their existence is also the motivation that drives me to strive for self-improvement. If I achieve my goal by relying on external help, I would be ashamed to be a son. I want to accomplish all of this with my own strength. Mom, please rest assured, I will not face my enemies until I have sufficient power.\"\n\nYu Ruyan could see that Nian Bing harbored deep feelings, but since he was unwilling to speak, she couldn't force him. With a faint smile, she said, \"Mom just wants to tell you that no matter when, whenever you need Mom's help, I will surely be by your side. I believe that one day, you will tell me the truth, won't you?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"Mom, I overheard your conversation with the Phoenix Clan Elder. I can probably guess the conflict between you two. Does the Phoenix Clan truly forbid intermarriage with outsiders?\"\n\nYu Ruyan's eyes dimmed, \"If there had been even a shred of leniency, the later tragedy wouldn't have occurred. Since you are already my child, there's no harm in telling you. I am fifty-one this year, and your godfather is fifty-three. My birth name is Feng Yan. Thirty years ago, when I was seventeen or eighteen, I was one of the most outstanding among the younger generation of the Phoenix Clan. Due to my talent and my profound understanding of the Nine-fold Fiery Qi, on the day of my eighteenth birthday ceremony, I was appointed the Phoenix of Hope. The Phoenix Clan, like the Dragon-human Clan, is governed by an elder system. There were originally five elders in the Phoenix Clan. Not only were they top experts within the clan, but they also had to possess royal blood. Back then, my father was one of the five great elders of the Phoenix Clan. His Phoenix Transformation had reached its Fourth Change, but on the very day he completed the Fourth Change, due to his overly hasty cultivation, he suffered qi deviation and died. Before his death, my father entrusted me to the other four elders. And because of my father's death, the Phoenix Clan needed a new elder to take his place. The selection of a new elder is made from all those with Phoenix Clan bloodline: whoever is most talented can become the Phoenix of Hope, which is the successor to a Phoenix Clan elder. Once the Phoenix of Hope reaches forty, they directly become an elder of the clan. And I was precisely that generation's Phoenix of Hope. Unfortunately, in the end, I did not become an elder of the Phoenix Clan.\"\n\n\"Was it all because of me? Ruyan, I've always regretted it, wondering whether our meeting back then was right or wrong. If I hadn't appeared, you wouldn't have had to go through such difficulties, nor would all those later hardships have arisen. Perhaps, under your leadership, the Phoenix Clan would have long flourished and prospered.\" Duke Lan Yu said with some melancholy, but his gaze toward Yu Ruyan was filled with deep affection.\n\nYu Ruyan smiled faintly, \"Brother Yu, our meeting was arranged by fate, something no one can change. Although we've been through many trials, our feelings have never weakened, even to this day. I've never regretted it. If I had to choose again, I would still choose to leave the Phoenix Clan with you.\"\n\n\"Ruyan.\" Lan Yu's voice trembled slightly. He stood up, went straight to Yu Ruyan's side, and opened his broad arms, embracing both Yu Ruyan and Nian Bing. At this moment, Nian Bing clearly felt a long-lost warmth. His vision blurred for a moment. *Dad, Mom, how wonderful it would be if you were still alive! Do you see? Nian Bing is very happy now.*\n\nAfter a while, Lan Yu finally released them. Looking at Nian Bing, whose eyes were red-rimmed, he said, \"When I was young, I was just a commoner; my title wasn't hereditary. In that place, the only way for a commoner to become a noble was to join the army and earn merits. In one respect, I'm like you: I also lost my parents when I was young, and it was my master who raised me. However, when I was thirteen, my master also passed away due to a chronic illness. Before he died, he told me to join the army, that truly powerful martial arts could only be experienced on a battlefield filled with blood and iron. So I went. I was tall from a young age; at thirteen, I already looked like an average fourteen or fifteen-year-old. Coupled with my robust physique from practicing martial arts since childhood, I smoothly entered the Olan Empire's army. Through my own efforts, ten years. It took a full ten years. I fought my way up from an ordinary soldier to a Brigadier General capable of commanding five thousand men. At that time, my martial arts had also entered the Martial Artist realm, making me the youngest Martial Artist in the Olan Empire. Another ten years passed, and I had been promoted to Major General. Due to my dedicated cultivation of martial arts, my strength was already quite renowned within the Olan Empire. Around that time, I also began organizing the precursor to the Silver Feather Knights. In one operation, the legion I led successfully ambushed an enemy supply depot, slaying ten thousand enemies. When we returned, our five-thousand-strong force had fewer than five hundred left. However, precisely because of our sacrifice, the tide of the battle was turned, and the enemy fled in defeat. That time, I was promoted to General and granted the title of Viscount, officially beginning my official career.\" At this point, he paused, a look of bewilderment in his eyes, as if he had returned to his military days. The iron and blood of the battlefield had left an indelible impression on his heart.\n\n\"I should be grateful for that battle. After it ended, the military headquarters gave me an extended leave so I could rest properly. I was alone in the world, without family, so since I had a holiday, I chose to travel. The travel destination was the Langmu Empire, which bordered the Olan Empire. And it was during this trip that I encountered Ruyan in the forest. Sigh, it's shameful to admit, I always prided myself on my peerless martial arts, but from the moment I met Ruyan until now, I've consistently been no match for her. The first time we met, Ruyan mistook me for an intruder and, with her strength already close to the Martial Saint realm, captured me and brought me back to the Phoenix Clan. The Phoenix Clan is actually a peace-loving race; they didn't kill me. After confirming I was just a traveler, they were ready to release me. But at that moment, I realized that I, who hadn't been involved in any romantic relationships at twenty-three, had fallen irrevocably in love with the girl who had captured me. Ruyan was already a core member of the Phoenix Clan then, but even though she was over thirty, she was still so pure and beautiful, looking like a girl in her early twenties. Her beauty hadn't changed in the slightest over twenty years. What attracted me most was her dark green hair and her pure, unblemished clear eyes. I couldn't bear to leave. Having studied at a military academy, I possessed decent military theory, so I stayed in the Phoenix Clan and imparted my military knowledge to them. All I wanted was to stay and have more opportunities to interact with Ruyan. As time passed day by day, a pure affection developed between Ruyan and me. Just before my extended leave was about to end, I took Ruyan and petitioned the Phoenix Clan elders, hoping they would allow Ruyan to marry me. However, at that time, how could I have known the rules of the Phoenix Clan? As soon as I made this request, I was immediately met with a stern refusal from the Phoenix Clan elders. They even severely injured me and expelled me from the Phoenix Clan. I didn't leave, because I couldn't bear to abandon the love of my life! Even if it meant giving up the title I had just received for Ruyan's sake, I would never regret it. I waited, believing that Ruyan loved me too. My waiting was not in vain. Three days later, Ruyan finally found an opportunity to escape from the Phoenix Clan. Young people are easily impulsive, and driven by love, we eloped back to the Olan Empire.\"\n\nYu Ruyan interjected, \"Upon returning to the Olan Empire, Brother Yu and I held our wedding. A year later, we had our first daughter. At that time, we were truly happy, envisioning a beautiful future together. I even naively thought that since Brother Yu and I already had a child, even if we returned, the elders wouldn't blame us anymore. But when our child was just six months old, an unimaginable calamity befell us. The clan elders finally found our whereabouts. Although Brother Yu and I were not weak, how could we contend against several elders? Ordinary soldiers posed no threat to us Phoenix Clan members. We could only run, running like mad with our child. The elders pursued us relentlessly. It was during that period that my Phoenix Transformation entered its Third Change. Running, after all, was not a solution. In a mountainous area not far from the Bingyue Empire, we were successfully cornered by the elders. The four elders launched a full-power attack on us. The exchange didn't last long before our child was snatched away by the elders. Elder Feng Xu—the very Elder Feng Xu who had watched me grow up—used Nine Heavens' Fiery Blaze to burn our daughter to ashes right there. At that moment, Brother Yu and I were both stunned, driven mad. That was the fruit of our love! By that point, we had no more inhibitions; our minds were blank, as if the flame of life was about to burn out at that very moment. Brother Yu, due to excessive grief, actually activated the potential within his body and unleashed the Thunder Dragon's Body, his battle qi completely merging with heavenly thunder, reaching a new realm. Afterwards, we both fell unconscious. I only remember that the four elders were all injured to varying degrees. Perhaps they thought we were dead from our severe injuries and didn't take our 'bodies' with them. When we regained consciousness, it was three days later. It took a full month of recuperation before we fully recovered, but our wounded hearts were irreparable. Our first daughter died just like that. Do you know how lovely she was? Even now, I remember her big blue eyes. I believe that if she had lived, she would have been even more beautiful than me. But she just died like that, consumed by cruel flames.\" As she spoke, Yu Ruyan clenched her fists, already sobbing uncontrollably.",

    "content": "「媽媽，您別傷心了，過去的都過去了，您現在還有晨晨，還有我……」這個時候，念冰也不知道該如何支勸慰玉如煙了。\n\n  藍羽深深的嘆息一聲，道：『念冰，或許你不相信，雖然我們的孩子沒了，但是，我和如煙對鳳族並沒有太深刻的仇恨。畢竟，如煙是鳳族長老們撫養長大的，是鳳族的一切培養了她，恨雖然深，但轉恩卻同樣深厚，所以，即使後來我們有了足夠報仇的實力卻依舊沒有行動。為了不讓如煙太傷心，一年之後，我們有了晨晨，我們怕悲劇重演，當晨晨一歲時，就把她送給了一個大人物做弟子，在那裡至少她是安全的，每年，我們偷偷的定期將她接回來共聚，一直到現在，我們才有把握保護女兒不受傷害。沒想到他們今天又來了，不過，這一次也給了他們教訓，就算是鳳族四大長老齊至，也未必就能戰勝我們。為了能夠保護晨晨，如煙這些年以來沒有一天懈怠，加上她的天賦，才史無前例的達到了鳳凰變的第六變。這就是我們與鳳族之間生的一切。現在我只是希望他們不要再來打擾我們的生活。我們不想再與鳳族有任何瓜葛。「\n\n  念冰用先前玉如煙的那塊手帕幫她擦拭著臉上的淚水，輕聲道：「媽媽，其實我知道，您還是無法忘記鳳族的一切，但事情都已經生了，一切都成為過去，放開心情吧。鳳族現在又有了新的希望之鳳，鳳女我是知道的，她這麼年輕就已經進入了武聖境界，將來成就不一定不低。「\n\n  玉如煙輕嘆一聲，道：「這正是我擔心的事。當那叫鳳女的姑娘激動的拉住你的手時，我仿佛又看到了二十年前那一幕重演。一個女孩子，一旦真正的愛了。就很難放棄，刻骨銘心地愛並不是時間可以沖淡的。念冰，能說說你們認識的過程麼？「 \n\n  念冰點了點頭，道：「我和鳳女是在冰雪城認識的，那裡，我到冰雪城是為了找一位著名的鍛造大師將火焰神之石融入正陽刀內，但沒想到的是，那位大師已經去世了，只剩下他的弟子，就是鳳女……「當下，他將自己與鳳女之間生的一切詳細的說了一遍，連在火龍洞中地事都毫無遺漏的說出。藍羽公爵和玉如煙都仔細的聽著他描述，當念冰說到他犧牲了自己的自由而讓加拉曼迪斯放過其他人時，兩人的臉色都變了。\n\n  玉如煙皺眉道：「念冰，雖然我和你叔叔的實力加起來也比不上那位火龍王，但你已經是我們的孩子。我們可以請晨晨的師傅幫忙。或許有機會地，只要你想離開加拉曼迪斯，並不是不可能的。現在我算明白鳳女為什麼再次見到你時會那麼激動了。捨己為人，在可能會付出生命的情況下你依舊選擇了拯救他人，這高尚的品質已經打動了她的心，恐怕，我的擔心是對的。鳳女已經不可自拔地愛上了你，但是，我真怕你們像當年我和羽哥那樣受到如此痛苦。坦白說，我不希望你和鳳女結合，不但是為了你，同時也是為了鳳女和整個鳳族。身為曾經希望之鳳的我已經離開了鳳族，如果鳳女在因為你而脫離鳳族，對鳳族的打擊將是無法估量的。畢竟，即使在鳳族。培養一名武聖也並不容易。「\n\n  念冰點了點頭，道：「媽媽，我明白您的意思，。但是，您也知道，當感情到了之時。根本不是人力所能抵擋的。不過，我可以向您保證，在我沒有報仇、沒有實力保護鳳女之前，我絕不會真的和她在一起。而且，我會尊重鳳女的選擇，如果她不願意和我在一起而選擇繼承鳳族長老之位，我一定不會勉強她的，您看這樣可以麼？其實，我真地不明白，為什麼鳳族就不允許王族成員和人類結合呢？鳳族本身也是由人類演化而來的，所謂的血統，就那麼重要？「 \n\n  玉如煙苦笑道：「這是鳳族社會下來的規矩，如果非王族成員，只是普通的鳳族人，或許長老們還有通融地可能。但是，鳳族現在的王族成員就那麼幾十人，每減少一個，對鳳族都是很大的打擊，你根本不可能得到任何通融，幸好有那頭巨龍跟在你身邊，我也能放心了。不過，你跟在他身邊真的好麼？他畢竟限制了你的自由，如果你想離開他，我們一定盡全力幫你。「\n\n  念冰微微一笑，搖頭道：「不，媽媽，我絕不會離開加拉曼迪斯的。「\n\n  念冰堅決的語氣讓玉如煙和藍羽同時吃了一驚，畢竟，加拉曼迪斯是限制念冰自由的，可他為什麼會如此堅決的準備留在加拉曼迪斯身邊呢？\n\n  看出自己新認的這對父母心中驚訝，念冰道：「不錯，在剛見到加拉曼迪斯之時，我心中大多數情結都是恐懼，畢竟，人類面對巨龍，幾乎是無法抵抗的。我並不是一個捨己為公的人，相反，我更重視利益。在當時那種情況下，如果我不站出來，恐怕所有人都無法離開火龍洞窟，那樣的話，我也一樣會留下。與其那樣，我何不大方一點，用自己的廚藝來吸引加拉曼迪斯放走其他人呢？至少，當只有我一個人的時候也更容易逃脫。那時在我眼中，加拉曼迪斯就是一頭殘暴的巨龍，隨時都有可能結束我的生命，只有吃才是他的弱點。但是，隨著不斷的接觸，我發現加拉曼迪斯並沒有想像中那麼可怕。至少從認識他到現在，他還沒有殺過一個人，他很狡猾，但是，狡猾卻要由聰明來做基礎的，他那幾萬年的智慧和淵博的知識，是我們人類遠遠無法相比的。和他在一起也有兩個月左右的時間了，他不但沒有傷害過我，甚至並沒有限制我的自由，而且，與這麼強大的巨龍在一起，對我會產生一種無形的壓力，在這種壓力的作用下，我在修煉時自然倍加努力。從加拉曼迪斯身上我學到了許多東西。其中包括你們先前見到的擬態魔法。如果不是與他在一起，如果不是他的全力相助，我根本不可能有現在這樣的實力。魔導士，對於大多數魔法師來說是可望而不可及的，但是，我卻在加拉曼迪斯的幫助下，短短一個多月來不但身體素質大幅度提高，而且水平也有了質的飛躍，沒有它。我的冰火同源根本無法有現在的小成。如果說開始時我只是一個被動的奴隸，那麼，現在我已經將加拉曼迪斯當成了朋友，或許，也是老師吧。「 \n\n  公爵府內的某個房間中，某個正在流著口涎地傢伙喃喃自語道：「還算你有點良心……「\n\n  玉如煙夫妻閒聊了一會之後，念冰告辭而出。藍尋已經給他安排好了居住的房間。他並沒有急於回房間休息，而是悄悄的出了公爵府。鳳女的出現攪亂了念冰的心，在惦念之中，他在奧蘭城中閒逛起來。雖然空間之戒中有可以呼喚鳳女的風笛，但他現在卻不敢吹，畢竟，鳳女和那兩位長老在一起。聽了玉如煙的話後，他對這些鳳族地長老們已經生起了很強地戒心。\n\n  下午的奧蘭城陽光依舊明媚，念冰走了大半個時辰，茫然尋不到自己的目標，無奈的嘆息一聲，心中暗想，鳳女，難道我們真的是有緣無份麼？\n\n  正在這時候，一個尖銳的聲音突然在念冰耳邊響起。驚訝中他抬起頭，周圍的行人熙熙攘攘，似乎並沒有什麼變化，而那尖銳的聲音，仿佛也只是針對他一個人似的，正在他以為自己神經過敏之時。在街道的轉角處一抹紅衣吸引了他的注意，定睛看去，只見一頭自己所熟悉的粉紅色長髮隨風飄動，還沒有來得及確認，那紅衣粉髮身影轉過街角不見。\n\n  是鳳女，念冰心中大喜，畢竟天生粉紅色長髮的人太少見了，而且念冰自問目光犀利，那襲紅衣正是鳳女今天去公爵府時所穿的長裙啊！沒有任何猶豫的，他立刻跟了上去，轉過街道時卻沒有發現鳳女地身影。念冰心中一動，鳳女一定是怕在嘈雜的環境中被自己的族人發現，想引自己到一個安靜的地方去。當下，他趕忙順著街道前行，接連轉過幾個彎，卻依舊沒有看到鳳女的足跡。 \n\n  正在念冰懷疑自己地判斷之時，尖銳的聲音再次響起，聲音的來源很明顯，他知道，這是鳳女在召喚自己，自己並沒有聽錯，在欣喜之下他趕忙快步朝聲音發出的方向走去。\n\n  尖銳的聲音不斷響起，在急切的心情中，念冰不知不覺間已經被引出了奧蘭城，越過城門，遠遠的，他終於看到了那抹自己所熟悉的身影，粉紅色的長髮在風中飄轉，是如此的動人，身影一閃，已經鑽進了大道旁的樹林之中。\n\n  念冰看了看周圍，默念咒語，以冰火同源引動風元素，在傲天刀的輔助下給自己施加了一個二階的疾風術，飛快的朝樹林中衝去。有了疾風術的幫助，他的身體如同輕飄飄的樹葉一般，在鳳女進入樹林的數息之後，也鑽了進去。尖銳的聲音適時響起，念冰辨別出確切的方位趕忙跑了過去。\n\n  終於，一路緊隨並沒有白費，當他跑入樹林深處之時，那抹紅色的身影再次出現，這一次，她並沒有跑開，站在那裡，背對著念冰方向，靜靜地等待著他的到來。\n\n  「鳳女。「念冰激動的呼喚著，身形快速飄飛到鳳女背後，伸手就向她肩膀抓去。\n\n  就在這時，胸口處的天華牌突然升起一股炎熱信息，念冰心底升起強烈不安，伸出去的右手硬生生的收了回來，身形快速向後一飄。\n\n  如同來自地獄的紅芒從他所處的方位掠過，狂躁的熱流會令念冰一陣窒息，如果他還在原來的地方，恐怕已經被那道紅光一斬為二了。 \n\n  粉紅衣的女子轉過身來，這哪裡是鳳女啊！分明是今天和她在一起的美女鳳香。由於她與鳳女都似乎鳳族的王族，在氣質上十分相象，再加上這一頭偽裝用的粉紅色假髮，不仔細看，從後面根本無法分辨的出。\n\n  紅色的光芒在鳳香手中長劍上跳動，冰冷的面龐令念冰心底升起一絲寒氣，強烈的殺機覆蓋著周圍方圓十丈的每一個角落，雖然鳳香在修為上遜色於鳳女，但念冰卻毫不懷疑，擁有鳳凰火焰的她絕對有殺死自己的實力。\n\n  穩定著自己的心神，念冰平靜的道：「原來是鳳香姑娘，不知你引我來這裡有什麼事麼？」\n\n  鳳香冷哼一聲，道：「你會不知道為什麼？我引你來的目的只有一個，就是殺了你。不用想怎麼逃跑了，在這裡，你根本沒有任何機會。」\n\n  念冰冷然道：「姑娘這句話未免大了些，難道你們忘記加拉曼迪斯說過什麼嗎？」\n\n  鳳香眼中流露出一絲不屑，「你堂堂一個男人，卻要依靠別人保護算什麼本事。何況，我們鳳族從來就沒有怕過任何人，即使是巨龍也不例外。今天殺了你，我們就會離開這裡，那頭巨龍想找我們麻煩也不是那麼容易的。有祖先鳳凰守護著我們，任何困難在我們面前都無法阻擋。為了鳳族的未來，我必須要殺了你。」\n\n  念冰笑了，英俊的面龐上流露出自內心的歡喜，陽光般的笑容看的鳳香不禁一楞，微怒道：「就要死了，你還笑？」\n\n  念冰微笑道：「鳳香姑娘，你知道我為什麼要笑麼？有兩個原因。第一個自然是因為鳳女。你們鳳族的長老派你來殺我，無非是怕鳳族的希望之鳳再像當初似的變成另一個玉如煙。其實，你們這樣做卻是在告訴我鳳女的心中有我，否則，你們也不會這麼在意了，我說的對麼？能得到鳳女的愛，你說我該不該高興呢？」",

    "content": "Feng Xiang rarely left the Phoenix Clan. Although she possessed formidable martial skills, how could she compare to Nian Bing in cunning? Recalling the elders' instruction to kill Nian Bing at all costs, her eyes immediately blazed with intense killing intent. Without waiting for Nian Bing to state the other reason, she instantly leapt forward, her longsword sweeping towards Nian Bing's waist with a gleam of red light.\n\nThe scorching airflow caused the surrounding vegetation to wither. Nian Bing's figure suddenly feinted to the left, yet appeared to his right in the blink of an eye, miraculously evading Feng Xiang's attack. Golden light and azure light flashed simultaneously as the Heaven's Pride Saber and Holy Radiance Saber appeared in his hands. Strangely, he did not use these two precious blades. Instead, he plunged both sabers into the ground before him. Light flashed again, and the Morning Dew Saber and Righteous Sun Saber appeared in his hands. This series of movements was completed in just two breaths' time.\n\nLooking at Feng Xiang, who evidently hadn't anticipated his ability to dodge her attack, Nian Bing calmly said, \"Miss Feng Xiang, you are truly impatient. Will you attack without letting me finish my words? The other reason is very simple: because you are the only one who has come to kill me. If the two Phoenix Clan elders were here, undoubtedly, I would certainly die. But with just you, it's not necessarily certain that you can kill me, is it?\"\n\nIt turned out that when he realized the other party was not a Phoenix Maiden, Nian Bing conversed with Feng Xiang while simultaneously projecting his spiritual power outwards. Through this period of cultivation, his spiritual power had greatly enhanced, especially his keen perception. Even Galamandis, once within a ten-meter radius of his body, would be easily detected. Through careful investigation, Nian Bing discovered that only Feng Xiang had come to kill him this time; the two elders were not present. This discovery immediately made him breathe a sigh of relief. With just Feng Xiang, although he didn't have absolute certainty, he still had a chance.\n\nIndeed, only Feng Xiang had come to assassinate Nian Bing. In some aspects, the Phoenix Clan was similar to the Dragon Clan, also being a proud race. As a proud Phoenix Clan member, Feng Xu hadn't seen any signs of strength in Nian Bing, believing that sending Feng Xiang alone would be more than enough to easily complete the mission. Nian Bing's guess was correct; the Phoenix Clan would not allow anyone who could threaten their Phoenix of Hope to exist. The Phoenix Clan could no longer afford to lose. If another Phoenix of Hope, painstakingly cultivated, were to be seduced by a human again, it would bring a devastating blow to the Phoenix Clan.\n\nFeng Xiang proudly said, \"Boy. Don't think that just because you've trained in martial skills for a few days, you're immortal. You're right, only I have come to kill you today, but that's already enough. Take my sword!\" The longsword in her hand flared with red light. Standing rooted to the spot, she suddenly slashed her sword towards Nian Bing. A crescent-shaped light slash of red energy appeared in mid-air. This kind of Dou Qi-consuming attack was not difficult for Feng Xiang to execute.\n\nAt this moment, Nian Bing's mind was exceptionally calm. In a fight between a mage and a warrior, although he was at an absolute physical disadvantage, this did not mean he had no chance. He pointed the Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess forward, and cold light radiated from the saber. Condensed magical power formed an ice barrier before Nian Bing. The next moment, his body had already shifted sideways. His Righteous Sun Saber also swung out. However, the saber he swung was very peculiar; it was not an attack. This Righteous Sun Saber, known as the \"Gnashing Roar of the God of Flame,\" instantly traced a red triangle in the air.\n\nThe ice barrier was not a Tier 4 Ice Wall Spell. This Tier 2 ice magic made little difference compared to paper in the face of Feng Xiang's formidable Nine-Parting Dou Qi. As red light flashed, the ice barrier didn't even have a chance to shatter before it was melted into water. But at this moment, the red triangle Nian Bing had drawn with the Righteous Sun Saber began to spin rapidly.\n\nThe blade light, originally aimed at Nian Bing, suddenly trembled and astonishingly slashed towards the red triangle. Red light flashed, emitting a loud bang. A nearly ten-foot-long gully immediately appeared on the ground, and the blade light vanished. With a pull of the Righteous Sun Saber, a large hand burning with raging flames surprisingly appeared at the location of the red triangle that had just been slashed by the Dou Qi attack. It was none other than the Tier 5 fire magic — Hand of the Fire God.\n\nThe magical changes were so astonishing that Feng Xiang even forgot to continue attacking. Originally, the Dou Qi slash was completely under her control, but in that instant, she suddenly found a powerful suction force pulling her Dou Qi slash aside. Most of her Dou Qi struck the ground, but about one-third of her Dou Qi was still drained away. That uncomfortable feeling of being unable to exert force made her instinctively take a step forward.\n\nFeng Xiang was uncomfortable, and Nian Bing was equally so. Under the mental resonance, a wave of dizziness swept through his mind, and his handsome face appeared a bit paler. The distance between him and Feng Xiang was less than thirty-three meters. With Feng Xiang's martial cultivation, it was impossible for him to get an opportunity to chant high-tier spells. Therefore, he had no choice but to test the magic he had only recently researched, and to his surprise, it actually succeeded. The two previous spells had cost him a great deal of effort; the calculations involving magical elements alone were extremely difficult. The purpose of the ice barrier was not to block the enemy, but to serve as a catalyst for this ice and fire fusion magic. As the ice shattered, the not-so-intense ice magic elements scattered around. And the red triangle, drawn with the Righteous Sun Saber, began to spin under Nian Bing's impetus. Ice and fire are two distinct elements; Nian Bing deliberately used ice elements to stimulate fire elements, allowing the full ferocity of the fire elements to be unleashed. In the sudden rotation, the volatile flame triangle generated a powerful suction force, pulling Feng Xiang's Dou Qi slash off course and absorbing some fire elements from it to replenish itself.\n\nThe most difficult part of this magic was control. The ice magic elements scattered after the ice barrier shattered must absolutely not stimulate Feng Xiang's Dou Qi. Instead, they had to completely act upon his own flame triangle. Otherwise, the magic would not only fail but also backfire. Furthermore, although some of the pulling force was mitigated when the flame triangle was attacked, Feng Xiang's attack was simply too strong. Under the guidance of his spiritual power, Nian Bing's spiritual power suffered a strong impact. Fortunately, his spiritual power, being that of a prodigy, was much stronger than that of ordinary mages; otherwise, he would probably have already fainted from the spiritual impact.\n\nAs the saying goes, opportunity is not to be missed. Nian Bing deeply understood this principle. The Righteous Sun Saber flew out of his hand. Under the control of his spiritual power, the Hand of the Fire God grasped the Roar of the God of Flame. Under the effect of the pure Flame God Stone, the Hand of the Fire God's magic system immediately elevated to Tier 6, and fire sparks flew in all directions. Immense flame blades shot out from the Righteous Sun Saber, intimidatingly slashing towards Feng Xiang.\n\nAt this moment, Feng Xiang finally realized that she was actually facing a powerful mage. Her original contempt for the enemy greatly diminished. Amidst the cry of a phoenix, her body shot into the sky, and the longsword in her hand burst forth with vast Dou Qi, going to meet the Hand of the Fire God.\n\nSeizing this opportunity, Nian Bing controlled the Hand of the Fire God while rapidly chanting a spell, \"Oh, great ice elements! Condense! Transform into the ice of eternal frozen rivers! Transform into the solid ice of moonlight essence! Fusion of ice and ice, appear! Dual-Colored Ice Sealing Sphere!\" With the Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess, the ice elements condensed at an extremely fast rate. Yellow light continually gathered before Nian Bing. This Tier 6 magic, the Dual-Colored Ice Sealing Sphere, was completed in an extremely short time. And at this moment, the Righteous Sun Saber, controlled by the Hand of the Fire God, had already clashed with Feng Xiang.\n\nNian Bing's control over magic was very tactical. He knew Feng Xiang's Dou Qi was overbearing. Just as the Righteous Sun Saber was about to clash with Feng Xiang's Dou Qi, the Hand of the Fire God suddenly flashed to the side. The flames on the Righteous Sun Saber instantly retracted, sliding past the Dou Qi on Feng Xiang's longsword. The flames reappeared, sweeping upwards towards Feng Xiang's lower body. In the midst of crisis, Nian Bing could no longer care about the distinction between genders. However, his attack completely enraged Feng Xiang.\n\nFeng Xiang, her phoenix-like aura brimming with majestic fury, her pretty face flushed crimson, her beautiful eyes seeming to spit fire. Her delicate body twisted strangely in mid-air, and the longsword in her hand transformed into countless sword shadows, sweeping towards the Hand of the Fire God.\n\nBoom—amidst the explosive sound, the Hand of the Fire God, which had been elevated to Tier 6, was forcibly twisted by Feng Xiang into a shower of light. The explosion of the Tier 6 magic surprisingly failed to push her back even a single step. However, she was not completely gaining the upper hand either. The sharpness of the Righteous Sun Saber was something she hadn't anticipated. The instant her Dou Qi burst forth, the Righteous Sun Saber had already sliced off a section of the longsword in her hand, drawing an arc in the air as it flew back in Nian Bing's direction.\n\nFeng Xiang's heart was now filled with intense killing intent. Chasing the Righteous Sun Saber, she rushed towards Nian Bing. The longsword, with a section broken off, had its power undiminished, brandishing a phoenix-like gleam in the air.\n\nAs a mage, the most important thing was to remain calm. Nian Bing did very well in this regard. As Feng Xiang followed the Righteous Sun Saber and rushed towards him, his Dual-Colored Ice Sealing Sphere was already complete. With a backhand motion, he integrated the Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess. The not-so-long saber body was like a spike protruding from the Dual-Colored Ice Sealing Sphere. With a pull of both hands, Nian Bing sent the Ice Sealing Sphere flying out in fierce rotation.\n\nWith the Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess as the core of the magic, the Dual-Colored Ice Sealing Sphere, like the Hand of the Fire God, elevated one tier. This Tier 7 magic contained a peerless divine blade within. Nian Bing gave this magic a very good name — Strangling Ice Sealing Sphere.\n\nAlmost the instant the Ice Sealing Sphere charged forward, Feng Xiang, bringing her vast Nine-Parting Dou Qi, attacked. Amidst a thunderous roar, the Strangling Ice Sealing Sphere followed in the footsteps of the Hand of the Fire God, turning into a sky full of ice shards. The Morning Dew Saber flew high into the air in rotation, falling towards Nian Bing. Nian Bing's whole body trembled, and he took a step back. His mind felt a wave of confusion, but he knew that at this moment, he could not show the slightest carelessness, or it would mean the end of his life. He forcefully patted his head and pulled out the Righteous Sun Saber that had fallen forward.\n\nIn the explosion of magic and Dou Qi, Feng Xiang was not as relaxed this time as before. Tier 7 magic was naturally much stronger than Tier 6. Furthermore, the original Dual-Colored Ice Sealing Sphere was solid condensed ice, and in terms of both impact force and hardness, it was far from comparable to the Hand of the Fire God. Although she shattered this magic with her Dou Qi, her body suffered a great shock. The Ice Sealing Sphere was rapidly spinning as it collided with her Dou Qi. Under the powerful control of Nian Bing's spiritual power, the Morning Dew Saber integrated into the Ice Sealing Sphere naturally impacted Feng Xiang severely. Fortunately, Feng Xiang had noticed Nian Bing's movements when she charged, and having learned from the precedent with the Righteous Sun Saber, she was not misled by the Ice Sealing Sphere and injured by the Morning Dew Saber. Even so, the longsword in her hand was twisted into fragments. Feng Xiang's originally forward-rushing body flew back. A sharp, icy current emanated from the Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess, clashing with the Nine-Parting Dou Qi in her body, causing Feng Xiang's expression to greatly change. She landed on the ground, kneeling on one knee, gasping heavily. She desperately tried to control her Nine-Parting Dou Qi to counterattack, gradually forcing the extreme cold energy out of her body. However, the internal injuries she sustained that afternoon showed signs of stirring. After all, among the four Phoenix Clan members, her injuries were the most severe, having only recovered seventy percent with the help of the two elders. Now, with Dou Qi consumption and magic invasion, her suppressed injuries showed signs of flaring up again.\n\nGenerally, mages possessed a strong sense of timing. Nian Bing attached particular importance to this aspect. Seeing Feng Xiang repelled, he immediately caught the Morning Dew Saber falling from the air. Forcibly suppressing the dizziness, he began to chant a spell.\n\n\"Ice, you are the representative of coldness; Fire, you are the source of heat. Oh, auras of ice and fire! Please allow me to merge your properties! Using your common origin as a catalyst, resonate!\" A soft hum simultaneously rose from the Roar of the God of Flame and the Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess. Amidst flashing light, the suppressed auras of the two peerless divine blades were completely released, tinting Nian Bing's body on both sides with red and blue respectively. Each drew a triangle; red and blue intertwined, forming the trigger for a magic hexagram. Surging magical aura rapidly swirled around Nian Bing.\n\nUsing ice and fire of the same origin as a catalyst, magic elements of various types rapidly condensed around Nian Bing's body. Faintly, seven-colored radiance could be seen appearing. Unfortunately, Nian Bing could only control four types at the moment. After all, without supreme magic blades, even Nian Bing, who possessed ice and fire of the same origin, could not use the Dragon Clan's mimicry technique.\n\n\"Wind of Freedom, you whisper gently. When facing friends, you are as warm as a spring breeze; when facing enemies, you are as biting as winter. Please lend me the extreme of your biting force!\"\n\nAnd the wind—the azure light of the Heaven's Pride Saber instantly soared, breaking free of restraints and soaring straight into the sky. The whisper of the Wind of Freedom, amidst a wailing sound, stirred the wind's very essence, shifting from gentle to fierce, sweeping through the vegetation in the forest and causing it to sway violently.\n\n\"Solitary Ice, coldness is your nature, hardness is your aura. Please merge your coldness and hardness, transform into an irresistible sharp blade!\" Blue light points condensed in the strong wind, forming into solid keen blades. These were not Tier 2 ice blades, but true profound ice. The solid ice blades shone with a chilling light, as the Tier 7 Ice Shatter Rain continuously formed.",

    "content": "The wind grew increasingly fierce, and the number of ice blades constantly increased, spreading through the air. Under the sunlight, these unmelting, solid ice blades swayed with the wind.\n\nFeng Xiang had just barely managed to expel the cold air from her body. Feeling the changes in nature, a sense of inexplicable panic arose in her heart. She vaguely felt that the magic Nian Bing was completing was not something she could resist. She spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, suppressing the internal injuries induced by the cold air. Clear phoenix cries continuously rang out from her mouth. The extinguished flames reignited, their color gradually turning from red to gold. This was precisely the Phoenix Flame, the first transformation in the Nine Phoenix Transformations.\n\nThe coldness in Nian Bing's eyes remained. Having gathered enough magic elements, he began the final incantation for this magic: \"Wind and Ice, you both possess the aura of nature, you are parts of nature. With Ice and Fire of the Same Origin as the guide, burst forth, Hurricane Ice Rain Art!\" Amidst two crisp 'zheng zheng' sounds, the Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess and the Whisper of the Free Wind floated before Nian Bing amidst the light that instantly burst forth from the red and blue magic hexagram.\n\nThe wind changed, becoming so violent. The aura of ice merged with the wind, just like the biting cold currents in winter. Ice shuttles, only three inches long but exceptionally solid, constantly wove and swayed in the wind. Like hailstones, they swept into the sky with the wind.\n\nA cold light flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. The ice blades in the wind, as if part of his body, swept towards Feng Xiang, who was over ten *zhang*¹ away. At this very moment, Nian Bing's body seemed to have completely merged with nature. Against the backdrop of the four-colored light from the four magic blades, he appeared so calm and harmonious.\n\nThe Sky Pride Blade and Morning Dew Blade, floating in the air, were fully displayed. Although this ice and wind fusion magic was only seventh-tier, under Nian Bing's nearly perfect fusion, it unexpectedly erupted with magic power reaching the ninth-tier. Feng Xiang's biggest mistake was giving Nian Bing the chance to chant a great magic. After entering the Archmage realm, though he had only just reached it, he could already use seventh-tier magic, and for both ice and fire elements, he could even barely use eighth-tier single-target attack magic. Facing such a magician, if they had time to chant spells, it would be very difficult for a martial artist of the Martial Arts Master level to win.\n\nIf Feng Xiang were in full condition now, perhaps she could have put up a fight. However, the injuries within her body made it impossible for her to exert her full strength. What's more, because Nian Bing possessed strong magic control, the Hurricane Ice Rain, which was clearly an area-of-effect magic, could be used by him as a single-target attack magic, just like the blizzard back then. Only, its power was much stronger than the blizzard's.\n\nThe wind, rolling with ice, surged down from all directions. Their target was only one: Feng Xiang, enveloped in golden Phoenix Flames. Those ice shuttles, directly piercing and shooting, were so powerful under the wind's rotation that even Nian Bing himself hadn't anticipated it.\n\nA clear phoenix cry emanated from Feng Xiang's mouth. With both hands raised, she propped up the Phoenix Flames into a golden flame barrier. The first ice cones that attacked melted upon entering the flames. But it was obvious that these ice cones, condensed with numerous ice elements, were not so easy to deal with. Although melted by the flames, each melted ice cone weakened Feng Xiang's Phoenix Flames by a few points. She no longer even had a chance to escape. Witnessing the overwhelming rain of ice cones, despair filled Feng Xiang's beautiful eyes.\n\nThe cold glint in Nian Bing's eyes suddenly weakened a bit. With a pull of his right hand, the powerful impact of the magic suddenly changed direction under his control. At this point, the Phoenix Flames around Feng Xiang's body were only burning on her skin's surface. Through the golden flames, her pale and despairing face could faintly be seen.\n\nUnder Nian Bing's control, the Hurricane Ice Rain swept around once, becoming more condensed. Just as Nian Bing was pondering how to deal with this incredibly powerful magic, he suddenly sensed a strong crisis. Without any hesitation, the Hurricane Ice Rain suddenly attacked behind him. The massive hurricane swept past, and he himself quickly dashed forward a few steps before turning around.\n\nSimilar golden flames were burning; however, this golden flame, in its form², actually had a pair of fiery red wings. Elder Feng Kong calmly looked at Nian Bing. Although the Hurricane Ice Rain blocked his path, it could not cause his burning Phoenix Flames to show the slightest sign of extinguishing. Nian Bing gasped sharply. He clearly understood the gap between himself and a Martial Saint. But at this moment, he had no burden; running was impossible. Wouldn't racing a Martial Saint be seeking death? Now, he could only seize the chance to chant spells and fight to the death; perhaps there was still a sliver of hope.\n\nThe attack method of Hurricane Ice Rain suddenly changed. Its original forward charge suddenly stopped under Nian Bing's control. The hurricane suddenly blew outwards from Elder Feng Kong as its center. Only, they blew along a specific trajectory, instantly forming a huge tornado. The wind blew even more intensely than before. The tornado carried surging cold currents, and with the ice shuttles that could pierce metal and stone, it continuously squeezed and attacked inward, trapping Elder Feng Kong within it.\n\nNian Bing didn't hesitate, quickly chanted spells, and a resolute light shone in his eyes. He recalled a sentence Galimardes once said: \"To become strong, one must struggle on the brink of death.\" Escaping might bring temporary luck, but one couldn't be lucky for a lifetime.\n\nAll along, Nian Bing had relied on his wisdom to avoid many crises. However, after hearing Galimardes's words, he gradually understood that if everything was primarily about avoidance, then he would never be able to become a true powerhouse. How could a person who frequently avoids things possess the aura of a strong individual? And in battles between true masters, aura often determined the inclination of victory. At this moment, with no chance to escape, Nian Bing finally understood the meaning behind Galimardes's words. At this instant, he secretly swore that no matter what difficulties he encountered in the future, he would never evade them again. In this situation, as long as he didn't die, the rate of his strength improvement would definitely increase significantly, and he might not be without a chance to contend against that Ice and Snow Goddess Priest.\n\nThe resolve he had made in his heart did not affect the speed of his spell chanting. Instead, his chanting was a few points faster than usual. Amidst the modulated sounds, the long blade Shengyao, which had been stuck in the ground, was now in Nian Bing's hand. Surging golden light continuously ascended under the effect of the spell. Dazzling light continuously emanated from the Shengyao Blade.\n\nPerhaps it was because it sensed Nian Bing's unyielding resolve. This time, the Shengyao Blade gathered light elements much faster than usual. The surging golden light filled the area around Nian Bing's body with warmth, and his heart also became exceptionally calm under the effect of the light elements. Nian Bing did not immediately make his next move, but instead intensely stared at Elder Feng Kong, who was trapped in the Hurricane Ice Rain.\n\nElder Feng Kong's appearance greatly startled Nian Bing and also solidified his resolve to fight to the death. However, the surprise in Elder Feng Kong's heart was far greater than Nian Bing's. Upon waking, Feng Xu had sent Feng Xiang to lure and kill Nian Bing. He wasn't worried; Feng Xu was currently asking Feng Nu everything about Nian Bing. And he didn't want to see such a scene, nor did he like that oppressive atmosphere, so he came to meet Feng Xiang along the route she should have returned by. When Nian Bing used the Hurricane Ice Rain, Feng Kong sensed the restless magical elements. Coupled with Feng Xiang's despairing and mournful phoenix cry, it made him rush over at the fastest speed, and he happened to see the scene of Nian Bing controlling the magic as it swept past Feng Xiang.\n\nThe Hurricane Ice Rain, this fusion magic of wind and ice, caught Feng Kong off guard. For a moment, although he had already prepared the Royal Feather, the second Phoenix Transformation, facing a fusion magic powerful enough to reach the ninth-tier, it was very difficult for him to break out. After all, the combination of wind and ice was so perfect. Possessing both the characteristics of wind and ice, the wind's ferocity and the ice's chilling cold posed a great threat to Feng Kong, who had a fire-attribute body. Furthermore, he himself was injured, so breaking out of this fusion magic unharmed was not an easy task.\n\nFusion magic was extremely rare on the continent, belonging only to a very small number of genius magicians. Moreover, these magicians had to possess dual elemental physiques. He never expected that this human, whom Feng Nu had secretly given her heart to, would possess such powerful strength, not in the least inferior to Duke Lanyu back then.\n\nThe golden light in Nian Bing's hand gradually burned into white. The Zhengyang Blade burst forth with splendid flames with a 'peng' sound. Nian Bing bit his tongue, focusing his mental power to a high degree, and rapidly chanted spells. His voice was deep, but the flames on the Zhengyang Blade grew increasingly intense. The scorching flames continuously merged with the golden light from the Shengyao Blade. Nian Bing's spell was complete, but the process of his magic condensation seemed endless. His bright blue eyes had now turned white due to excessive consumption of mental and magic power. The magical aura around his body fluctuated unstably. The white light on the Shengyao Blade continuously showed flame-like fluctuations, and the light grew increasingly intense. Its brightness seemed to have surpassed the afternoon sun, illuminating the surrounding forest brightly. And under the illumination of this strong light, the plants in the forest were actually slowly growing at a clearly discernible rate. A strange aura continuously spread around Nian Bing's body.\n\nGolden flames lit up behind Nian Bing, carrying a scorching aura. Didn't Nian Bing feel it? Of course he did, but he paid no heed. That slender figure, carrying golden flames, suddenly crashed into the white light surrounding Nian Bing. A scream rang out, and her body bounced back at twice the speed it had come. This sudden attacker was precisely Feng Xiang, whom Nian Bing had let go earlier.\n\nFeng Xiang, who cultivated the Nine Departures Dou Qi, now had her clothes scorched black by the flame backlash. Her body suffered a massive impact, and she fainted to the ground in the warmth, completely losing her combat ability.\n\nNian Bing stood there motionless. At this moment, in his eyes, there was only Elder Feng Kong of the Phoenix Clan, trapped within the Hurricane Ice Rain. He clearly knew that the real threat was imminent.\n\nFeng Kong naturally felt Nian Bing's gaze, especially Nian Bing's continuously condensing magic, which unexpectedly brought immense pressure to Elder Feng Kong, a Martial Saint. Seeing Feng Xiang's life and death unknown, Feng Kong no longer held back. The golden flames around his body instantly surged, and his entire body became illusory. This was precisely the Phoenix Illusionary Demonic Body, the third transformation in the Phoenix Transformations.\n\nThe golden flames transformed into the form of a phoenix, and surprisingly spun upwards, following the hurricane tornado. The phoenix's body swallowed the hurricane. When the flames changed direction and charged towards Nian Bing, the Hurricane Ice Rain had already completely disappeared, and the wind that had been blowing also became silent. At this moment, the entire forest seemed to have become still. The fire phoenix, somewhat weakened by the Hurricane Ice Rain, continuously flickered with Elder Feng Kong's figure. It instantly rushed before Nian Bing, and the golden flames, just like the Hurricane Ice Rain had enveloped Feng Kong earlier, engulfed Nian Bing's body.\n\nNian Bing moved. In an instant, he discarded the Zhengyang Blade. He gripped the thick hilt of the Shengyao Blade with both hands, using his waist to drive his back, his back to drive his arms, and his arms to drive his hands. His entire body seemed to move forward with the Shengyao Blade, and white light flames burst forth amidst the blade's glow. Countless barely discernible blade shadows continuously flickered in the air.\n\nFeng Kong, now transformed into a fire phoenix, suddenly discovered with terror that Nian Bing had disappeared from before him. In his place were nine giant dragons burning within massive white flames. The nine white giant dragons, enveloped in flames, lunged at him from different directions. The pure aura of light and the scorching aura of flame both reached their limits instantly.\n\nThe combination of light and fire formed the Holy Flame. And when unleashed with the power of the Dragon Dance Collection, it was the attack Nian Bing now presented. Fusion magic was absolutely not as simple as one plus one equals two. Even if it was the same magic, if used in different forms and ways, its power would seem completely different. And the Dragon Dance Collection before him was clearly the best way to unleash this Holy Flame technique.\n\nThe nine white giant dragons were no longer as simple as mere carvings. Under the effect of the Holy Flame, their power was absolutely no weaker than any martial skill. Applying a carving blade technique to magic was probably something only Nian Bing could have thought of.\n\nGolden flames and white flames surged upwards in a mutual struggle. All plants within a hundred *zhang* radius turned to ashes. When the light reached its limit, it gradually dimmed. Nian Bing's body, like a tattered sack, scraped a long gully across the ground. His clothes had completely vanished, not even a hair remained. His entire being had turned charcoal black under the effect of the Phoenix Flames, lying there like a piece of charcoal.\n\nFeng Kong had indeed been injured that afternoon, but he was, after all, a Martial Saint. Although Nian Bing had used all his potential when unleashing this final move, the gap between an Archmage and a Martial Saint could not be completely bridged. After all, a lean camel is still bigger than a horse³.\n\nHowever, if Nian Bing were still conscious now, he would definitely be proud of his achievement, because, although standing, Feng Kong's body was also charcoal. Only, his body was still able to move.\n\n---\n¹ *Zhang* (丈): A traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.3 meters or 10.9 feet.\n² The original Chinese for \"in its form\" was 評價 (píngjià), meaning \"evaluation\" or \"assessment.\" This appears to be a likely typo in the original text for a word meaning \"form\" or \"appearance.\"\n³ A Chinese idiom (瘦死的駱駝比馬大, *shòusǐde luòtuó bǐ mǎ dà*) meaning that a powerful entity, even in decline, still surpasses a less powerful one, even when the latter is at its peak.",

    "content": "Spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood, Feng Kong looked at Nian Bing in the distance and said haltingly, \"Such a strange mage, so young yet so powerful—this is the first time I've ever seen one. To think you can use four magic elements to attack me. If you were a little stronger, perhaps I would be the one dead. Unfortunately, you're still not strong enough. Sigh, actually, I shouldn't kill you. You just let Feng Xiang go, and I...\" Speaking of this, Feng Kong suddenly remembered Feng Xiang, whom Nian Bing had sent flying earlier. His heart jolted. Gritting his teeth and enduring the immense pain constantly radiating from his body, he flashed a few times and arrived at the spot where Feng Xiang had previously fainted. To his surprise, Feng Xiang was actually lying there perfectly unharmed, and had not been 'baptized' by the earlier explosion of the two flames. He probed a little, and although Feng Xiang had fainted, her breathing was still steady, with no signs of further injury.\n\nPicking Feng Xiang up from the ground, Feng Kong let out a long sigh, shook his head with some helplessness, and glanced deeply at Nian Bing, who had turned into charcoal. Taking faltering steps, he slowly made his way deeper into the forest.\n\nJust as Feng Kong's figure disappeared from sight, a man dressed entirely in red leisurely emerged from behind a distant large tree. Although he seemed to walk slowly, he arrived before the charcoal-like Nian Bing in just two steps. He was none other than Garamandis, the Fire Dragon King.\n\nGaramandis couldn't help but let out a chuckle as he looked at Nian Bing's pathetic state. \"Usually, you're the one barbecuing meat for me, but I didn't expect you to be barbecued by someone else this time. Hmm, it smells awful, not fragrant at all. The meat you barbecue tastes better. You stinky brat, stop playing dead and get up.\" As he spoke, he kicked Nian Bing in the waist, sending his entire body flying.\n\nA scream came from Nian Bing, who had already been reduced to charcoal, along with a large mouthful of fresh blood. A weak voice rang out, \"What the f***, Garamandis, do you f***ing have no sympathy at all? You were clearly nearby, why didn't you save me? Damn it, don't even think about me cooking for you again.\"\n\nGaramandis feigned innocence and said, \"Who said I was nearby? I just arrived. By the time I wanted to act, it was already too late. Sigh, can you blame me?\"\n\nNian Bing, completely blackened, sat upright and opened his eyes. His eyes revealed a furious expression. \"You're lying! Don't I know you? You were definitely off to the side. If I hadn't been lucky enough to survive, I really would have been roasted alive!\"\n\nGaramandis chuckled, \"Since you had a way, why should I help you? Even at the last critical moment, you had the strength to protect that woman. How could you die? But what I don't understand is why you didn't go all out and fight. Under all the situations you created, your strength and that Phoenix Clan fellow's were already basically leveled out. Why take the risk? Were you really that confident you wouldn't die?\"\n\nNian Bing snorted, shaking off the charcoal from his body. Amidst the charcoal, a blue light was revealed, and a cold aura permeated out. It was precisely the Sigh of the Ice Goddess — Morning Dew Blade.\n\nGaramandis suddenly realized, \"Good boy, so you relied on it to escape disaster! No wonder you were so confident.\"\n\nNian Bing gasped weakly, panting heavily. \"Martial Saints are really hard to deal with! I never expected Elder Feng Kong, weakened as he was, to still be so fierce in the end. Fortunately, I had a backup plan and kept the Morning Dew Blade in my embrace, otherwise, I would definitely have died. I'm not an idiot. If I really had no confidence in the end, I would definitely have used a curse. I saved Feng Xiang because I didn't want to forge a deep grudge with the Phoenix Clan. For Feng Nü's sake, I had to take the risk and try! It hurts so much.\" As he spoke, he agitated his wounds, and Nian Bing's whole body convulsed involuntarily. He glared angrily at Garamandis and said, \"Do you have no sympathy at all? Hurry up and treat me!\"\n\nGaramandis thought deeply for a moment, and said, \"Sorry, Nian Bing, I've forgotten how to use the mimicry of Light magic.\"\n\nNian Bing raged, \"Bullshit! You forgot Light magic, can't you use Water magic? I'm suffering from fire injuries right now!\"\n\nGaramandis still had the same expression. \"But I've forgotten Water magic too. How about this, I'll be a good person and help you.\" As he spoke, he casually waved his hand and drew the Holy Radiance Blade, which had fallen not far away, into his hand. Then he threw it in front of Nian Bing, \"Heal yourself.\"\n\nNian Bing wanted to argue, but he no longer had the strength to speak much. Heal himself? If he still had magic power, would he need Garamandis to tell him? Gritting his teeth and enduring the agony throughout his body, he painstakingly gathered the last trace of magic power within him and cast an extremely ordinary Water Healing Spell on himself. Although the effect was very poor, it was still better than nothing.\n\nHis mind felt heavy, and the dizziness grew stronger. He just wanted to collapse and fall asleep. Just then, a scorching current flowed into his body, making Nian Bing's entire body tremble. Garamandis's deep voice rang out, \"Nian Bing, kid, if you don't want your magic to regress, start meditating immediately! If you want to save your parents, you must be stronger than anyone else.\"\n\nNian Bing's body jolted, and his mind instantly cleared somewhat. He opened his eyes and glanced at Garamandis. From Garamandis's gaze, he saw a hint of seriousness. He took a deep breath, painstakingly sat cross-legged, and without another word, immediately began to meditate. It wasn't that he didn't want to complain, but that he simply didn't have the strength to do so now.\n\nWatching Nian Bing enter a meditative state, Garamandis withdrew the hand he had placed on him. He smiled as he looked at Nian Bing, and a look of approval appeared in his eyes. He mumbled to himself, \"This kid's comprehension is really good, and his innate conditions are excellent. He's a talent with great potential. I'll help him out then. After all, I still want to eat what he cooks.\"\n\nIn the previous battle, Nian Bing made the best judgment after realizing Feng Kong's appearance. If he were to confront him head-on, he knew he was definitely no match for Feng Kong. However, as a mage, as long as he could complete his incantations, he could possess stronger attack power than a warrior of the same rank. Therefore, he immediately used his powerful spiritual force to make the Ice Rain he had just cast unleash its maximum power. He launched a fierce attack while Feng Kong had not yet stabilized his footing. His purpose was not to wound the opponent, but to weaken their strength.\n\nNian Bing's calculations were precise. He knew that Feng Kong, like Feng Xiang, had been injured in the battle against Yu Ruyan that afternoon. Internal injuries don't heal that easily; even with strong Dou Qi, the body needs time to recover. It was precisely because of this that he didn't use a curse to enhance his strength. Then, he unleashed the strongest magic attack he could currently use.\n\nThe siege of Hurricane Ice Rain gave Nian Bing the opportunity to chant spells for a long time. After the seventh-tier magic, Holy Radiance, was cast with the Holy Radiance Blade as a conduit, he immediately activated his strongest eighth-tier fire magic — Burning Heaven. For survival, he held nothing back this time. All his magic power was wagered on this fusion magic of Light and Fire. Since Light magic and Fire magic had no conflicting properties, and one was eighth-tier while the other was seventh-tier, their fusion presented no difficulties. When Feng Kong, weakened, attacked him with the Phoenix Illusionary Demonic Body, he then used Dragon's Elegiac Dance to activate his fusion magic, Sacred Flame, instantly unleashing unimaginable powerful might.\n\nHurricane Ice Rain reached the ninth tier, while Nian Bing's Sacred Flame powerfully surpassed the ninth tier, entering the tenth-tier realm. A wounded and weakened Martial Saint facing his Archmage-level magic attack might not gain any advantage. This was something he had calculated long ago. The Sacred Flame, on the other hand, was conceived based on the Dragon's Elegiac Dance he had suddenly used under Garamandis's pressure back then. Over these past days, the application of mimicry and fusion magic, combined with the improvement of his own strength, had allowed Nian Bing to achieve such an advancement. If not for the effect of the recent Ice Rain, even he himself wouldn't have dared to believe that all of this was true.\n\nHowever, a Martial Saint was a Martial Saint after all. Compared to the single-target tenth-tier attack magic Nian Bing unleashed by exhausting all his potential and magic power, Feng Kong, although greatly weakened by various circumstances, was still somewhat stronger than Nian Bing had imagined. The formidable Phoenix Flames, based on the Phoenix Illusionary Demonic Body, almost took Nian Bing's life. Fortunately, Nian Bing had prepared the Morning Dew Blade in advance, and relying on the Sigh of the Ice Goddess, he managed to resolve the lingering fire poison. Coupled with his resilient body, which had been modified by Garamandis, he thus survived. His judgment was correct: Feng Kong was much easier to talk to than Feng Xu, and he had already suffered severe injuries from Nian Bing's attack, so he naturally wouldn't pay much attention to the charcoal-like Nian Bing, which was why Nian Bing feigned death and lay there. Of course, at that moment, he himself was only a hair's breadth away from fainting. If it weren't to ensure his own safety, he probably would have fainted long ago. There was also another important reason: he had to retrieve his precious blades. They were treasures as precious as his life! Without them, how could Nian Bing have displayed his current level of skill? Alas, he managed to deceive Feng Kong by playing dead, but he couldn't deceive Garamandis.\n\nWith the help of the energy Garamandis infused, Nian Bing's almost depleted magic power re-coalesced within his body and began the recovery process. Perhaps because the depletion was too severe, this time, when he entered meditation, his spiritual force completely entered a dormant state, losing all perception of the outside world.\n\n...\n\n\"Please, Elder Xu, spare Nian Bing! I will never leave the Phoenix Clan for him, I beg you!\" Feng Nü knelt before Elder Feng Xu, her face streaming with tears. Her exquisite face was filled with pleading, and her beautiful aquamarine eyes were filled with worry.\n\nFeng Xu coldly looked at Feng Nü, who was kneeling before him, and said indifferently, \"It's too late. I won't allow any opportunities to exist. Feng Xiang has already gone to kill that boy. I imagine she'll be back soon. Although Feng Xiang's strength is not as great as yours, you should be clear that she will never defy my orders.\"\n\nFeng Nü trembled violently and cried out in dismay, \"What? You... you already sent Sister Xiang? Why? Why?!\" She knew Nian Bing's strength very well. Although Nian Bing's magic was very peculiar, Feng Xiang was a martial artist approaching the Martial Saint realm. She had only been delayed in entering the Martial Saint realm because her comprehension was slightly inferior to Feng Nü's. In terms of cultivation time, Feng Xiang had cultivated for at least three more years than her. In Feng Nü's mind, if Nian Bing were to encounter the cold and ruthless Feng Xiang alone, he would have no chance at all. Now, she had only a sliver of hope: that Nian Bing would not leave the Duke's mansion, or that he would always stay with that dragon.\n\nFeng Xu looked indifferently at the pale-faced Feng Nü. \"As the Phoenix of Hope of the Phoenix Clan, you should know what a great responsibility rests on your shoulders. You are the future of the Phoenix Clan, and I will never allow anyone to undermine your loyalty to the clan. I don't object to you expressing your emotions, but the object of your affection can only be someone from our clan. Even if that boy only developed feelings for you unilaterally, he absolutely cannot be spared. I don't want a second Feng Yan to appear.\"\n\n\"Why? Why?\" Feng Nü looked impolitely at the elder before her. \"As a child, I had no childhood at all. From the day I understood things, I've been diligently cultivating. Back then, you all taught me that I must work hard for the future of the Phoenix Clan. You and the other elders cared for me meticulously and placed strict demands on me. For more than ten years, I've almost constantly been thinking about how to improve my strength. To retrieve the Nine Departures Dou Qi that Hua Tian had secretly learned from our clan, I found him. He used his own body to forge the Departure Heaven Sword as a final memento, and before his death, he imparted his miraculous forging techniques to me. Elder Xu, you should know that my sense of responsibility has always been strong. No matter what I do, I always prioritize our clan. Why can't you trust me? Why must you kill the innocent?\"\n\nFeng Xu let out a long sigh. \"Child, perhaps you don't fully understand the matter of emotions yet. If this thing called emotion truly comes, it's something you can't stop. Love is a mysterious power. Back then, your mother, she...\" Speaking of this, Feng Xu suddenly paused, as if he had let something slip, and covered his embarrassment with a cough.\n\nFeng Nü's body trembled. \"Elder, my mother? What happened to my mother? Didn't you say she sacrificed herself for the safety of our clan? You...\"\n\nJust as Feng Xu was about to explain, heavy footsteps suddenly sounded. With a slight frown, he turned to look, and red flames had already risen from his body.\n\n\"Big Brother, it's me.\" A weak voice came with the heavy footsteps.\n\nFeng Xu's heart jolted, recognizing it as Feng Kong's voice. He truly flashed and rushed over, and just then, he saw the completely blackened Feng Kong, stumbling, carrying Feng Xiang back.\n\n\"Kong, my brother, what happened to you?\" In great alarm, Feng Xu truly took Feng Xiang from Feng Kong's hands. Feng Nü flashed to Elder Feng Kong's side, supported his body, and channeled her pure and robust Dou Qi into Feng Kong's body.\n\nWith Feng Nü's help, Feng Kong visibly perked up. He shook his head and said, \"Don't worry, I'm fine. I'm not dead yet. Feng Xiang only fainted, it's nothing serious.\"\n\nA cold glint flashed in Feng Xu's eyes. \"Is it Little Yan?\" In his opinion, only Yu Ruyan could have injured Feng Kong and Feng Xiang to such an extent.\n\nFeng Kong shook his head and said, \"No, it's not Little Yan. Big Brother, didn't you realize that Little Yan actually has no hostility towards us at all? Otherwise, as that fire dragon said, if Little Yan has reached the Sixth Transformation, then even if we join forces, we wouldn't be her match. Her strength should already be infinitely close to a Divine Master. Aside from Feng Nü, I haven't seen anyone with better aptitude than her.\"\n\nFeng Xu looked at Feng Kong in surprise. \"Who was it? Who else could possess such strong power?\"\n\nFeng Kong glanced at Feng Nü with some hesitation, sighed, and said, \"It was that boy.\"\n\nFeng Xu's entire body trembled. \"Impossible. I don't believe he could reach the Martial Saint realm at such a young age.\"\n\nFeng Kong smiled bitterly, \"Big Brother, he isn't a warrior, but a mage; one could say, a genius mage. He can actually use four magic elements. Although his own strength couldn't contend with mine, the fusion magic he unleashed was extremely powerful.\"\n\nHearing Feng Kong's words, Feng Xu couldn't help but fall into a daze. \"Could it be... could it be that what happened back then is going to repeat itself again?\"\n\nFeng Kong shook his head and said, \"It won't repeat. Although his strength far exceeded our estimates, I still killed him after all. Compared to his magic, a mage's body is even more fragile than an ordinary person's. Having been struck by my Phoenix Flames, unleashed via the Phoenix Illusionary Demonic Body, he had no chance of survival.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\"Excellent!\"\n\nFeng Xu let out an excited cheer, while Feng Nü's entire body swayed, as if the sky had collapsed. Hot blood rushed to her brain, and everything before her eyes turned completely blood-red. She knew very well that Elder Feng Kong wouldn't lie. Since he said Nian Bing was dead, he must truly be dead. But how could Feng Nü be willing to believe this fact?\n\n\"No, no. This isn't real, this definitely isn't real! Nian Bing wouldn't die! He was with that dragon!\"\n\nFeng Kong sighed and said, \"Girl, calm down a little. That boy was lured into the forest by Feng Xiang, who disguised herself as you. No one was following him. Actually, he has good character. He originally had the chance to kill Xiang'er, but he gave it up. If his final magic hadn't been so strong, perhaps I could have let him live. But under those circumstances, if I had relaxed even a little, I might have been the one to die. Girl, that person is dead. Stop thinking about it.\"\n\nWhy, why? The sky seemed to collapse at that moment. Feng Nü's delicate body trembled unceasingly. Her originally bright large eyes were veiled with a misty, ashen gray. Only at this moment could she be certain that Nian Bing had left an indelible mark in her heart. She didn't know if this was love, but she was very clear that losing Nian Bing caused her such immense pain.\n\nIf Nian Bing hadn't died, Feng Nü would certainly not have defied the elders' wishes and would have followed them back to the Phoenix Clan. However, now that Nian Bing was dead, the various thoughts that Feng Nü had suppressed now constantly surged within her heart. All she could think of now was Nian Bing's goodness. From the pigeon meat rice Nian Bing made for her when they first met, all the way to Nian Bing abandoning his freedom, and even his life, to save everyone in the Fire Dragon Cave. Each of those scenes was so clear before her eyes.\n\nThe wind blew gently. The spring wind should have been warm, but Feng Nü's heart was so cold.\n\nThe dazed Feng Nü, standing motionless, was completely unaware that red flames were gradually igniting on her body. The color of the flames was changing, undergoing peculiar transformations with her emotions. The red light gradually turned dark red, and then from dark red, it gradually became even dimmer. Her aquamarine eyes were turning deathly gray, and a pair of massive dark red wings gracefully emerged from her back.\n\n\"Ah—\"\n\nThe piercing sound was so mournful; it was entirely pain from the depths of her heart. Under the shock of the sound, the leaves on the surrounding trees fell like tears. She suddenly raised her head, staring angrily at Feng Kong and Feng Xu. \"Why, why couldn't you spare him? What did Nian Bing do wrong? Without him, I would probably have died long ago. Why did you have to kill him? Why did you have to drive me to despair? Why wouldn't you believe my explanation? Now I finally understand why Senior Feng Yan chose to be with that human back then! Because you didn't even give her a chance to explain! Nian Bing is innocent. He was implicated by me. He's dead, he's dead! I, I...\" Amidst her mental disorientation, the Departure Heaven Sword unsheathed itself. Feng Xu and Feng Kong were shocked to realize that the dark red flames erupting around Feng Nü's body were actually several degrees hotter than the golden Phoenix Flames. That seemed to be the burning of anger and sorrow, and the Departure Heaven Sword radiated an incomparably intense hatred.\n\nHolding the sword with both hands, Feng Nü faced the two elders. The formidable aura emanating from her body actually made Feng Xu's heart feel a pang of weakness. The feeling of being completely locked onto by hatred was unbearable. He suddenly realized that fear had reappeared in his heart.\n\n\"No, I can't kill you. I can't fight you. You are the ones who raised me. Kill—!\" Feng Nü's body suddenly floated off the ground. The Departure Heaven Sword, which had been aimed at the two elders, suddenly swept sideways, and a dark red light, nearly ten *zhang*¹ long, swept across the vegetation.\n\nFeng Xu's movements were very fast. The instant Feng Nü's Departure Heaven Sword swept out, he had already darted to her front and chopped a palm onto her slender neck. After unleashing that sword strike, Feng Nü's body seemed to have been completely drained. Combined with this palm strike, her body slowly slumped to the ground. At the moment her delicate body fell, Feng Xu and Feng Kong clearly saw two drops of faint red tears gracefully slide down.\n\nJust at this moment, a rustling sound suddenly came from the forest. The area previously swept by that dark red light, whether shrubs or tall trees, had completely turned gray. No, to be precise, it should be ash. Under the gentle breeze, in just a few blinks of an eye, a large, fan-shaped clearing had appeared in the forest.\n\nFeng Kong gasped sharply. \"Heavens! What kind of power is this? Big Brother, are you confident you could block it?\"\n\nFeng Xu shook his head and smiled bitterly, \"Now I'm also doubting whether the decision I made earlier was correct. Feng Nü's Phoenix Flames seem to have undergone some strange mutation. That last strike seemed to have drained all her Dou Qi. But even I'm not confident I could have blocked that strike. Was killing that boy truly the right thing to do? The girl's reaction is so strong. It seems she truly has feelings for that boy.\"\n\nFeng Kong sighed and said, \"I have to admit, that boy's magic is extremely powerful, and he's handsome too. Girls are bound to be attracted to him. Big Brother, you don't need to worry too much. Didn't you see that Feng Nü still maintained a shred of clarity at the last moment and didn't attack us? Let's take her back and slowly guide her. I believe she is a sensible girl.\"\n\nFeng Xu took a deep breath, neither confirming nor denying, and said, \"At the very least, a thorn has already been planted in her heart, one that can never be removed. But our Phoenix Clan can no longer endure any more losses. Back then, after Big Brother Feng Ming passed away, he entrusted Little Yan to our care. But she chose to unite with an outsider, instead of taking Big Brother Feng Ming's place. Five years ago, Feng Tian also passed away. Of the original five elders, only three remain. If we can't find two more to fill the ranks, then in two more years, how will we hold the Phoenix Beacon Sacrifice, which only occurs once every fifty years? Sigh. I'm truly worried!\"\n\nA look of dejection appeared in Feng Kong's eyes. \"I'm also troubled by this. Big Brother, Little Yan has actually reached the Sixth Transformation! This is much more powerful than we imagined. We originally came this time to ask her to return. How about we no longer demand that she kill that boy named Lan Yu, and ask her to come back with us to preside over the ceremony? With her Sixth Transformation ability, if she guides Feng Nü a bit more, Feng Nü will surely complete her Third Transformation sooner. Together with us three old fellows, if we gather five royals above the Third Transformation, we'll be able to hold the Phoenix Beacon Ceremony. Moreover, with Sixth Transformation Little Yan presiding, the ceremony will be relatively much easier.\"\n\nFeng Xu shook his head and said coldly, \"Even if we don't demand she kill Lan Yu, do you think she'll come back with us? Don't forget, in Little Yan's eyes, we are the murderers of her daughter. Perhaps she'll spare us due to old ties, but she will absolutely never acknowledge herself as a Phoenix Clan royal again.\"\n\nFeng Kong hastily said, \"But we didn't kill her daughter back then!\"\n\nA sharp cold glint burst forth in Feng Xu's eyes. He glanced at Feng Nü, who had fainted on the ground, and said, \"Are you asking me to tell her that Feng Nü is that little girl who turned to ash in the flames back then?\"\n\nFeng Kong nodded, \"That's the truth. Back then, Big Brother, at the last moment, secretly protected Feng Nü's body with Dou Qi and kept her alive. Facts prove that your choice was correct. Feng Nü perfectly inherited her mother's genes, and her comprehension is in no way inferior to Little Yan's. Perhaps our decision not to intermarry with outsiders was fundamentally a mistake.\"\n\n\"Bullshit!\" Feng Xu flew into a rage. \"The royal bloodline must be kept pure! To uphold the dignity of our clan, to uphold the rules of our clan, the secret of Feng Nü's lineage absolutely cannot be spread. Otherwise, where would the authority of the clan rules be?\"\n\nFeng Kong agitatedly said, \"Big Brother, is authority really that important? What we need to face now is the ceremony two years from now! Now, not only does Little Yan resent us, but even this girl Feng Nü already harbors resentment. With internal worries and external threats, how are we to cope with such a situation?\"\n\nFeng Xu bent down and picked up Feng Nü. He tossed a porcelain bottle to Feng Kong and said, \"You take some medicine first. We'll talk after we leave here. There are still two years. We'll find a way eventually. That boy you killed should have some connection to Little Yan. I don't want her to know we were the ones who did it. If, in the end, there's still no way, perhaps I'll go find Little Yan again and explain everything clearly.\" With that, he walked to the side, also cradled Feng Xiang in his arms, and walked step by step into the distance.\n\nLooking at Feng Xu's retreating back, Feng Kong let out a long sigh, \"Big Brother, why do you put yourself through this? You clearly care about Little Yan the most in your heart, yet you insist on putting on a facade of sacrificing personal feelings for righteousness. Back then, it was precisely you who decided to spare Little Yan and her husband!\"\n\n...\n\nTwo distinct sensations, warmth and coolness, continuously nourished his body. His dormant spiritual force received ample rest. As his spiritual force gradually awakened, Nian Bing's consciousness, residing within his body, witnessed a strange sight. It was two light clusters, one red and one blue. The red light cluster was below, sinking into his *dantian*², while the blue light cluster was above, suspended near his throat, above his chest. The red and blue light clusters emitted rings of halos, interweaving within his body. Strangely, when these two interweaving lights came into contact, not only did they not conflict, but they easily passed through each other. When Nian Bing used his spiritual force to sense the light emitted by these two clusters, he was surprised to discover that the upper and lower light clusters were highly condensed Ice magic power and Fire magic power, respectively. However, the light they emitted was constantly changing. But regardless of the changes, whenever the Fire magic power's aura came into contact with the Ice magic power's aura, the volatile characteristics of the Fire magic power would completely disappear, becoming unusually calm, while the Ice magic power would become much more active. Although the characteristics of the two magic powers were different, there was no sign of incompatibility. Instead, they complemented each other. Each time they made contact, they would absorb magic power from outside to replenish themselves, enhancing Nian Bing's magic strength.\n\n---\n¹ **Zhang (丈):** A traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.3 meters or 10.8 feet.\n² **Dantian (丹田):** In Chinese internal alchemical and martial arts traditions, the *dantian* refers to the main energy centers in the body, typically located in the lower abdomen.

    "content": "Nian Bing nodded, saying, \"But, top-tier magic gems aren't that easy to find. My luck has been quite good, but I only have four so far. I'm still missing Earth, Space, and Dark types. Do you know where I can find them? You have so many in your collection, aren't there any top-tier gems among them?\"\n\nGalamandis said, slightly annoyed, \"Good boy, trying to scheme against me. No, no, if you want to use them, find them yourself. Don't forget, even your gems should belong to me. I'm just lending them to you now. You said you'd take me to Aolan City for special delicacies? Bullshit! You didn't even spend enough time in Aolan City before leaving. You were clearly just going to find someone.\"\n\nNian Bing said, a bit awkwardly, \"You saw it yourself, because of the war, the Aolan Empire is so desolate. Of course, there are very few delicacies of any kind. After all, only when a country prospers can all industries flourish. This time it's different, our destination is the prosperous Huarong Empire. By then, there will naturally be good things to eat. My former teacher once said that the Huarong Empire gathers the most high-level chefs.\"\n\nGalamandis showed Nian Bing his fist, saying, \"That had better be the case. If I find out you've tricked me again, you're dead.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Trick you? How could I? Galamandis, I've thought of another magic combination. How about you let me try it out? Using you as the target.\"\n\nGalamandis was startled, saying, \"You want to use me as a target? Dream on.\"\n\nNian Bing tempted, \"A big pot of Pearl Jade White Porridge. Deal or no deal?\"\n\nHearing this, Galamandis was immediately swayed. He glanced at Nian Bing, somewhat hesitant. Nian Bing quickly said, \"Great Galamandis, you know that if I directly cast magic, it will inevitably cause significant magical fluctuations, easily attracting unnecessary trouble. But with you, it's different. Even a casual barrier from you can easily block my magic.\"\n\n\"Two pots of Pearl Jade White Porridge, made with your full heart for me, otherwise, forget it.\" Galamandis stated his demand.\n\n\"No problem, you have my word.\" Nian Bing smiled, looking at Galamandis. Whether human or dragon, as long as they had a weakness, he wasn't afraid they wouldn't comply.\n\nA red light flashed, enveloping Nian Bing's body, followed by a burst of silver light. Both simultaneously disappeared from the official road.\n\nHalf an hour later, two people reappeared on the official road: one was naturally the triumphant Galamandis, and the other was a disheveled and pale Nian Bing.\n\n\"Why is it like this, Galamandis, you pervert, how can you reflect magic?\" Nian Bing's voice, though angry, was weak and powerless.\n\nGalamandis chuckled, \"Do you think your enemies will show you mercy? If you want to survive better, work hard and figure it out yourself. When are you making the Pearl Jade White Porridge?\"\n\nNian Bing fell into thought. He couldn't understand why the magic he devised this time, which used Ice-Fire Homology combined with two mimetic forms, a total of four magic fusions, still wasn't as powerful as the two he used that day. What on earth was going on? Where did the problem lie?\n\n\"Kid, I know what you're thinking. Alright, make it three pots of Pearl Jade White Porridge instead of two, and I'll tell you what you did wrong.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes lit up. He said eagerly, \"Good, no problem, three pots it is, tell me quickly. Why did I expend over eighty percent of my magic power, using two seventh-tier and two sixth-tier, a total of four magic fusions, yet the power wasn't much stronger? Although it looked more spectacular, the effect was too poor, completely disproportionate to the magic power consumed.\"\n\nGalamandis chuckled, \"You idiot, do you think fusion magic is that easy to use? Even if you have Ice-Fire Homology as a guide, when using four types of magic, you simply can't fully bring out the characteristics of each magic system. Especially when four types of magic appear simultaneously, they will produce either repelling or attracting characteristics among themselves. These characteristics are extremely subtle. Even when using the same magic, each time there will be different changes. Unless your mental power is strong enough to control even higher-tier magic, why bother with such a difficult and unrewarding method of fusing four types of magic? So, I'll tell you a simple theory: fusion magic is indeed good, but the fusion of two types of magic is already sufficient. Fusing too many magic systems will only produce a counter-effect. When you were using that magic just now, I almost burst out laughing, wanting to see you make a fool of yourself. Fortunately, your strength is decent, and you weren't backfired. If you do this again later and become a laughingstock, don't say you ever followed me.\"\n\nAfter hearing Galamandis's words, Nian Bing suddenly felt a sense of enlightenment. Yes, excessive fusion was not something he could control. Even a powerful dragon like Galamandis, his strongest magic was only a single fire-element spell. Why should he pursue fusing too many types of magic? It would be better to fully master the characteristics of each magic system and use different combinations when facing different enemies. That way, the effect would naturally be much better. Having understood this, a faint smile unconsciously appeared on Nian Bing's face.\n\nJust then, Galamandis's expression suddenly changed. He said in a deep voice, \"Wait here for me, don't move.\" With a flash of red light, his figure vanished. The moment Galamandis left, Nian Bing's heart tightened, because he clearly felt a heavy killing intent emanating from Galamandis. This was the first time he had felt such an aura since he knew Galamandis. Although he didn't understand why, he knew that whatever could provoke such killing intent in Galamandis, and become Galamandis's enemy, was definitely not something he could deal with.\n\nNian Bing walked to a large tree by the roadside and sat down, slowly recovering the magic power he had lost earlier, carefully observing the surrounding movements. It wasn't long before the red light shone again, and Galamandis returned. His handsome face was filled with fury. Red light flickered faintly around his body. He came before Nian Bing and slammed his palm onto a large tree, instantly turning the trunk into flying ash, covering Nian Bing's head and face. \"Bastard. Damn it, he got away again, that scoundrel, faster than a monkey.\" Galamandis cursed furiously.\n\nNian Bing brushed the dust off his body and asked, \"What did you find?\"\n\nGalamandis said, \"Just now, I suddenly sensed the aura of a Mo'aodasi Sealing Bottle, and immediately gave chase, but that guy escaped using spatial magic.\"\n\nNian Bing said, puzzled, \"Did that guy steal your Mo'aodasi Sealing Bottle and then come around to provoke you? Isn't he tired of living?\"\n\nGalamandis shook his head, saying, \"No. Although that was also a Mo'aodasi Sealing Bottle just now, it wasn't the aura of *my* one. The seven Mo'aodasi Sealing Bottles are identical, but because they are guarded by us Seven Dragon Kings, each one will have some of our aura on it. I can be certain that the one that appeared just now was not the one stolen from me. It seems these guys truly have some ability, daring to attack all Seven Dragon Kings at once. Nian Bing, I'm afraid I won't be able to drink your Pearl Jade White Porridge for a while. Things are much more serious than I imagined. I must now gather the other six Dragon Kings to see how many Mo'aodasi Sealing Bottles have been stolen. The mission entrusted to us by the Dragon God must not be taken lightly in the slightest. You be careful. I'll come back for you after these matters are resolved.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Galamandis in surprise, \"You mean, you're leaving now?\"\n\nGalamandis glared at him unhappily, saying, \"Haven't you always wanted your freedom back? What? Regretting it now? Do you still want to come with me to see the other six Dragon Kings? The Dragon World is not a place for humans to enter. Take care of yourself. As for your future cultivation, you just need to meditate regularly to increase your magic power, and look for top-tier gems when you have the chance. I'll lend you this for now. Don't worry, finding you is easy for me. Be careful and protect your life. You are absolutely not allowed to die before you've repaid me three times with Pearl Jade White Porridge.\" The red light transformed into silver, and a dazzling silver glow appeared in Galamandis's hand. It was a peculiar weapon. At its center was a hexagonal gem, silver in color, but its silver light constantly changed, each shift causing the entire weapon to shimmer. Centered around the hexagonal silver gem, six blades extended outwards, each only about half a foot long. With the silver light flickering, Nian Bing had no doubt about its sharpness.\n\nGalamandis held his palm upwards, and the six-bladed silver weapon rapidly spun in his palm. No matter how his arm moved, the blades continued to flicker as if stuck to his palm. The silver light danced with Galamandis's hand. He mumbled a few incantations, and the blades suddenly vanished. When Nian Bing's thoughts stirred, the six-bladed silver weapon reappeared ten zhang away, drawing a graceful arc, and all plants in its path were cleanly severed.\n\nThe six-bladed silver weapon returned to Galamandis's hand. It was still spinning. Galamandis said, \"Did you see it clearly now? This weapon is very difficult to control. Whether you can truly unleash its power will depend on you. You should have noticed that the central gem is a top-grade Space-element magic gem. The rarity of Space-element magic gems is no less than that of Light and Dark. Moreover, for you right now, if you can master Space-element magic through mimicry, the benefits are immense. At the very least, it can help you save your life better. But be careful, don't cut off your own hand before you even use it. This weapon has many ways of being used; it depends on your wisdom. The weapon's name is Xuan Ji. It was forged in ancient times by one of your human master smiths, completed with the help of twelve Space-element Archmages. Compared to the Sacred Radiance Blade, it is much more mysterious, but its origin is no less significant. Go and experience it for yourself. Oh, right, it already has a title, you don't need to come up with another one: The Ever-Changing Hexagram—Xuan Ji Blade.\" With a flash of silver light, it landed at Nian Bing's feet. The next moment, Galamandis's figure vanished, enveloped in red light.\n\n\"I only have this one top-grade magic gem, so keep it safe. Remember the Pearl Jade White Porridge you owe me. Take care of yourself...\" The voice faded into the distance, and the dragon's aura completely vanished from the air. He had regained his freedom, but at this moment, Nian Bing's heart was filled with a sense of loss. He didn't even understand why, but looking at the strangely shaped Xuan Ji Blade on the ground, his heart was full of reluctance. Galamandis's handsome appearance and teasing tone echoed repeatedly in his mind. His heart trembled slightly, \"Galamandis, are you just leaving like this?\"\n\nSuddenly, Nian Bing looked up and shouted loudly at the azure sky, \"Galamandis, listen to me! If you don't come looking for me within three months, what I owe you will be voided!\" His voice was loud, startling the birds in the forest. After shouting this, Nian Bing slowly lowered his head and muttered to himself, \"If you can come back within three months, I will definitely cook for you well, without any conditions.\" In truth, he didn't even realize it himself, but after two months of interaction, Galamandis had become a mentor and a friend in his heart. The sudden separation inevitably made him feel somewhat lost.\n\nWhat exactly was inside the Mo'aodasi Sealing Bottle? Galamandis wouldn't tell him. What secrets were sealed within those seven bottles? Nian Bing's heart was filled with doubt, and also curiosity. He increasingly realized that there was too much he didn't know on this Sunshine Continent. Those things were not at his current level. If he wanted to understand everything, he had to start with himself.\n\nNian Bing vigorously shook his head, casting aside the distracting thoughts in his mind. The sense of loss gradually faded. After all, Galamandis would still come back; he surely wouldn't part with the delicious food Nian Bing made. Now, what he had to do was travel to Tiandu City, the capital of the Huarong Empire, and fulfill his promise to Long Zhi. He remembered being only seven years old when he left Tiandu City. It had been over ten years; he was finally going back.\n\nNian Bing wasn't in a hurry. Whenever he reached a city, he would rest for a few days to meditate and study magic. When he left Aolan City, there were still three months until the Five-Nation Rising Magic Master Tournament, which was enough time for him to travel. Just as he had heard in Aolan City, the further south he traveled within the Aolan Empire, the more barren the surroundings appeared. Looking around while on the road, he often saw desolate landscapes. This phenomenon continued until Nian Bing entered the Huarong Empire from the southwest of the Aolan Empire.",

    "title": "Chapter 82: The six-pointed rhyme of the divine machine—Xuanhuan Sword (Part 2)",
    "content": "Far away, a gigantic city sprawled like a monster on the vast plain. It could no longer be described as merely a city; Taru City, straddling the border between the Oland Empire and the Huarong Empire, was clearly an enormous fortress. On both sides of the fortress, Huarong Empire troops stretched for hundreds of miles. The Huarong Empire boasted an excellent geographical location; as an empire deep in the south, it occupied large stretches of fertile land. Furthermore, its southwest and western sides were coastal, and although it bordered the Langmu, Qilu, and Oland Empires, the defensive range it needed was not extensive. The Huarong Empire placed extreme importance on its military. The empire's main combat strength was comprised of four group armies: the Northern Group Army stationed at the border with the Langmu Empire in the north, the Northeastern Group Army stationed near Taru City in the northeast, the Eastern Group Army stationed at the border with the Qilu Empire in the east, and the Central Group Army stationed near Dudu Tiancheng. The number of active-duty troops nationwide never fell below 1.2 million. For the other empires, maintaining so many legions would undoubtedly be an immense burden, but for the prosperous Huarong Empire, this was not a difficult matter at all. For example, when they launched attacks on their neighbors, it wasn't truly to seize anything; more often, it was for military training. After all, soldiers who had never seen battle were certainly not qualified soldiers.\n\nEach of the Huarong Empire's four group armies was commanded by a Marshal, with the Central Group Army being the most powerful. The renowned Flame Lion Knights were the elite of the Central Group Army. What Nian Bing now saw was precisely the Huarong Empire's Northeastern Group Army stationed at Taru City. Taru City was not like Ice Orchid City, which was jointly administered by two nations; the Huarong Empire's vast army was stationed here, while the Oland Empire's troops had freely withdrawn inland. In terms of equipment, pay, numbers, and all other aspects, the Oland Empire was far inferior to the Huarong Empire. If it weren't for the Langmu Empire, also a powerful nation, restricting the Huarong Empire, the Huarong Empire would have long ago opened its massive Flame Lion's maw and devoured the Oland Empire.\n\nBefore reaching Taru City, Nian Bing first had to pass through the Huarong Empire's defensive line, where he would undergo strict inspection. If even a shred of suspicion was aroused, entry into the Huarong Empire would be denied outright. However, Nian Bing had his own way of dealing with the inspection. After all, he himself was from the Huarong Empire, and although most of his understanding of the Huarong Empire was limited to his father's accounts. Although he didn't particularly love his homeland, his roots were in Huarong, and all his memories concerning the Huarong Empire were deeply etched.\n\nStanding behind the inspection queue, Nian Bing looked up at Taru City's massive city gate, resembling a giant lion's maw, and murmured, \"Huarong, I've returned. After more than ten years, I've returned. I remember passing through here when I left back then, Father. Rest assured, if possible, I will reclaim what is rightfully ours.\"\n\nThe inspection moved quickly. Most commoners and merchants entering the city possessed transit permits issued by the Huarong Empire, and with these, they could easily enter the city. After all, few people dared to cause trouble in the Huarong Empire currently, and it wasn't wartime. The inspection naturally wouldn't be very strict.\n\nFinally, it was Nian Bing's turn. The armored guard captain, just like he did with others, told him, \"Show your pass.\" His tone wasn't stern; this was because he saw Nian Bing's long golden hair. Golden hair was very common in the Huarong Empire. Guards were always more polite to their own countrymen. It had once been statistically shown that over ninety percent of high-ranking nobles in the Huarong Empire had golden hair.\n\nShaking his head, Nian Bing calmly said, \"I'm sorry, I don't have a pass.\"\n\n\"None?\" The guard captain looked at him somewhat surprised. Nian Bing carried no luggage, and his clothes were very ordinary, yet the captain, who had seen countless people, discerned an unusual aura about him. \"Since you have no pass, a full body search is required. Please go over there.\" As he spoke, he pointed to a simply constructed hut next to the city gate.\n\nShaking his head again, Nian Bing extended his right hand. \"I think that won't be necessary.\" With a soft whoosh, a ball of flame ignited from his palm. The flame flickered in the gentle breeze, immediately raising the surrounding temperature by several degrees. \"I am a magician.\"\n\nThe surprise in the guard captain's eyes instantly turned to respect. \"Ah, a Mr. Magician. Please, enter the city.\" After speaking, he quickly stepped aside, and Nian Bing strode in without any further obstruction.\n\nThe Huarong Empire was a nation that revered fire. Due to the flourishing state of magic within the country, everyone from the king to the commoners held magicians in extreme respect, especially powerful ones. Therefore, the king had once issued an order that any magician, regardless of their nationality, could freely enter the Huarong Empire. Fire magicians were especially welcome in the Huarong Empire. Combined with Nian Bing's golden hair, the guards naturally wouldn't obstruct him further.\n\nThe first feeling upon entering Taru City was prosperity, a stark contrast to the Oland Empire. The streets were teeming with bustling crowds, including quite a few soldiers on leave. Businesses of all kinds were thriving. For a border city to be so affluent, perhaps only the Huarong Empire could achieve it. Here, no one worried about foreign invasion; after all, the Huarong Empire's Northeastern Group Army stationed here was not to be trifled with.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Nian Bing sighed softly, \"Is this the air of my homeland? Homeland, I suppose no one would admit I belong to Huarong.\" As a Huarong Empire native, he was returning this time to represent the Ice Moon Empire in the Rising Star Magician Competition. To him, this wasn't really an irony.\n\nWalking down the street, Nian Bing prepared to find an inn to stay in. There were still two months until the Magician Competition, and although Dudu Tiancheng was not close from here, half a month was more than enough time to reach it, so he had plenty of time. Nian Bing was currently preoccupied with magicians. He had absolute confidence in his culinary skills. On his way to the Huarong Empire, he had decided to use these three months before the competition as a journey for his magic cultivation. In each place he visited, he would stay for at least a day to practice the various spells he had contemplated on his journey, especially the newly acquired Xuanji Knife, which was the utmost priority in his training. Someone once said that at close quarters, warriors were the bane of magicians, but spatial magicians were the bane of all warriors. This showed the status of spatial magic in the continent's magic world. Possessing spatial magic was equivalent to having an amulet against warriors. Of course, spatial magicians also had their weaknesses. Namely, their attack capabilities were relatively poor. Spatial magic excelled most at teleportation and confinement. Only at the Arch-Magician level or higher would their offensive power gradually become apparent.\n\nSuddenly, Nian Bing saw the crowds on the street rapidly surging in one direction, as if something had happened. He thought to himself, 'Could someone dare to cause trouble even in Taru City? Surely there aren't people that foolish.'\n\nThe crowd surged. Pushed by the flow of people, Nian Bing involuntarily moved forward in that direction. Curious, he asked a passerby beside him, \"What's happening over there? Why is everyone going that way?\"\n\nThe passerby said, \"Little brother, you must be new here! This is a grand event that only happens once every few years! The Hualong Restaurant's triennial Culinary Challenge, held in Taru City Square, just began today and will last for three days. These three days will be a carnival for our Taru City! Famous chefs from all over the country come here to participate in the challenge. This competition is said to be second only to the God of Cooking Competition in the culinary world! What a shame if you don't see it! Hurry up, or you won't be able to see it if you're too far!\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred. He had never heard Cha Ji mention this \"Hualong Culinary Challenge.\" He figured it must have emerged in recent years. However, since it was said to be second only to the God of Cooking Competition, it should be quite a spectacle. Driven by curiosity, he quickly followed the crowds towards Taru Square.\n\nIn the distance, a massive square could already be seen. This square was so large that it probably occupied one-third of Taru City's area. It was originally a parade ground specifically used for troop reviews. But at this moment, it had become the venue for a culinary competition. The entire square was packed with people, at least nearly 100,000, gathered in the square. It was only thanks to the large number of guards maintaining order that no commotion occurred.\n\nIn the center of the square was a circular platform nearly two *zhang*^1 high and about fifteen *zhang* in diameter. A red carpet was laid out on the platform, making it extremely eye-catching even from below. What surprised Nian Bing most was that this giant circular platform could actually rotate. Around the platform, ten brand new cooking stoves were arranged, with essential kitchen tools behind them. Clearly, it could accommodate ten chefs for competition simultaneously. Seeing such a colossal culinary display stage, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement. As a chef, to be able to showcase one's culinary skills on such a stage—how wonderful that would be! No wonder his master once said that the Huarong Empire gathered the most outstanding chefs. It seemed he hadn't been wrong; perhaps only in the Huarong Empire could there be such a grand event in the culinary world.\n\nTen *zhang* away on either side of the circular platform, there was a raised stage, each with a canopy and chairs inside, clearly meant for VIPs.\n\nAt this moment, a dozen or so people walked onto the giant circular platform. From their attire, it was easy to discern that these were high-ranking officials and dignitaries of the Huarong Empire. Among them, one person walked to the front of the platform. This individual was somewhat plump, wearing a long red robe with gold trim that appeared exceptionally lavish. His small eyes sparkled, and he held a strange object from which a magical glow seemed to emanate.\n\n\"Everyone, quiet down. Please listen to me.\" He did not shout hoarsely, but his deep, resonant voice easily reached everyone's ears. Nian Bing's heart jolted. If it were a Martial Saint-level expert, they could naturally achieve this with powerful *dou qi*. However, this person clearly wasn't using *dou qi*. In an instant, he understood and gasped inwardly, realizing that the object held by that person was actually a magical amplifier. An amplifier capable of producing such sound would undoubtedly require extremely precious magical gemstones as its backing. It seemed the investment in this competition was truly significant!\n\nThe square gradually quieted down. The five thousand soldiers responsible for maintaining order appeared well-disciplined, their long spears pointing diagonally into the air, constantly watching the surrounding populace to prevent any unforeseen incidents.\n\nFatty Hua, on the rotating circular platform, looked down at the crowd below and smiled, \"Hello everyone! I believe anyone from Taru City should recognize me, right? That's right, I am Hua Feizi of Hualong Restaurant. You can just call me Fatty Hua.\"\n\n\"Fatty! Fatty! Fatty!...\" Instantly, a chorus of cheers erupted from below the stage. Seeing the jubilant expressions of the commoners, it was clear that Fatty Hua of Hualong Restaurant was extremely popular in Taru City. Nian Bing inquired with a cheering commoner nearby and only then learned that this Fatty Hua was the owner of Hualong Restaurant. He was extremely amiable and charitable. Eighty percent of the money Hualong Restaurant earned each year, he would donate to the government, the military, and the Huarong Empire Magician's Guild. Furthermore, he often introduced delicious and affordable dishes for ordinary commoners, thus earning an excellent reputation in all regards. He had even been bestowed the title of Viscount by His Majesty, the King of the Huarong Empire. It was precisely because of his connections that the Hualong Culinary Challenge was able to grow more popular with each edition, gradually catching up to the influence of the God of Cooking Competition.\n\nFatty Hua spoke again, \"Thank you all for your immense support for this edition of the competition. This is already the fourth Hualong Challenge. Ah, I, Fatty Hua, am gradually getting old, but the culinary world of our Huarong Empire is continuously flourishing and developing. I am honored to witness this current prosperity. Alright, I won't ramble on any further, lest you all start throwing eggs at me.\" As he spoke, he made a comical expression, instantly eliciting thunderous laughter from the crowd below.\n\nWith a smile, Fatty Hua waited for the laughter from the crowd below to subside, then said, \"The rules are the same as previous editions. The competition will still proceed through three stages: preliminaries, semifinals, and finals. The preliminaries are being held on the south side of the square, inside our Hualong Restaurant. They've already been underway for ten days. Within these ten days, we've selected over a hundred outstanding chefs, and they will participate in the semifinals here. For the semifinals, I will designate three main ingredients, and these chefs will cook various delicious dishes for evaluation. Finally, ten people will be chosen to participate in the ultimate finals, which will be the day after tomorrow. All the delicacies prepared for this competition, I will present to the most respected people of our Huarong Empire—namely, the Northeastern Group Army, who have continuously defended our homeland!\" As he spoke the last five words, he deliberately raised his voice. Instantly, the entire scene erupted in a burst of cheers, a surging wave of sound that even people outside Taru City could probably hear. The fervent atmosphere greatly astonished Nian Bing.\n\n---\n^1 A traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or 10.9 feet.",

    "content": "Just from the scene before their eyes, one could see how much the common people of the Huarong Empire revered the army. With such public sentiment, how could the entire empire not be strong and prosperous? No wonder it could become the strongest nation on the continent.\n\nA slender man walked out from among the people on the stage. Saying he was slender was no exaggeration at all; his waist was supple as he walked. Dressed in a white robe that highlighted his overly handsome and delicate face, he came before the crowd. From his appearance, his age was completely indiscernible. Without using a magic amplifier, he smiled and said, \"Thank you, Fatty Hua. Perhaps you don't know me yet. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Arc Light, the new marshal of the Northeast Army Group.\" His voice was somewhat gentle, yet it reached the ears of the people more clearly than Fatty Hua's, who had used a magic amplifier.\n\nA commotion immediately broke out below. This marshal, who somewhat resembled a woman, did not cause resentment among the people; in the eyes of most, there was a strong look of respect. Nian Bing vaguely heard someone beside him saying, \"Heavens! Is he Marshal Arc Light, known as the Demonic Marshal? He's actually been transferred here from the Northern Army Group! That's wonderful! I heard he's a Martial Saint!\"\n\nNian Bing's heart trembled slightly. This marshal, who looked like an elder sister, actually possessed Martial Saint-level strength. Being transferred from the Northern Army Group to become a marshal here, he was definitely not someone to be trifled with. He quietly inquired among the enthusiastic people around him and immediately learned some of Arc Light's exploits. It turned out that before coming to the Northeast Army Group, Marshal Arc Light was the Deputy Marshal of the Northern Army Group. He had led troops in many battles against the Langmu Empire and was known for his cruelty and bloodlust. It was said that thousands of lives had been claimed by his sword. If anyone were to be deceived by his appearance, they would certainly be the first to die. Now, being transferred here as a marshal, he had clearly received a promotion. His nickname in the Imperial Capital was the Demonic Snake, but because the people of the Huarong Empire respected him greatly, they directly called him the Demonic Marshal.\n\nOn the stage, Demonic Marshal Arc Light revealed a smile that could bewitch men. \"Alright, I won't disturb everyone from enjoying the magnificent culinary arts. This time, Fatty Hua and I will be the chief judges. My tongue is very discerning, so the chefs preparing to compete must work hard.\" After speaking, he nodded slightly to everyone and walked behind the circular platform. The crowd automatically parted to both sides, watching Arc Light and the Guizhou people¹ walk onto the left and right viewing stands. On the stage, only Fatty Hua remained.\n\nFatty Hua cleared his throat, smiled slightly, and the fat on his face jiggled continuously. \"This old fatty here has only one hobby in this life: eating. For this hobby, I started learning cooking at seven years old and studied under many masters. By this year, I've had fifty years of cooking experience. Now I only have one wish: to promote and expand culinary arts, allowing more people to taste delicious food. The rewards for this competition are more generous than before. In previous sessions, only the champions of our competition were recommended to participate in the Chef God Competition. However, as the influence of the Hualong Culinary Challenge has increased, after discussions between me and the Chef God Competition organizing committee, the top three contestants in this competition will all have a chance to participate in the Chef God Competition. At the same time, the prize money has also increased. Chefs who advance to the semifinals will each receive one hundred purple gold coins, and the ten chefs who enter the finals will be rewarded five hundred purple gold coins. As for the final top three, they will receive generous rewards of two thousand purple gold coins, one thousand five hundred purple gold coins, and eight hundred purple gold coins respectively. Oh, this Fatty Hua is going to go bankrupt again! Those who still want to register, hurry up! Today is the last day for registration.\" His comical appearance couldn't help but draw a burst of laughter from the crowd.\n\nNian Bing's heart pounded somewhat fiercely. How could he let such an opportunity slip by? He didn't care how much the prize money was. What he cared about was the opportunity to compete on the same stage with high-level chefs. Both Zha Ji's previous teachings and his own personal experience told him that, under the pressure of competition, chefs often display two types of performance: one is a significant drop in standard due to nervousness, and the other is to fully exert their skill, creating even more wonderful food. Without a doubt, Nian Bing belonged to the latter type.\n\nWithout further hesitation, he inquired among the people about the location of the Hualong Hotel. He immediately squeezed out of the crowd. This was an opportunity not to be missed; whether it was the Hualong Culinary Challenge or the Chef God Competition, he absolutely would not give up on either.\n\nThe Hualong Hotel was much more magnificent than Nian Bing had imagined. If Dachengxuan represented magnificence, then the Hualong Hotel was the pinnacle of magnificence. The eleven-story building represented the highest level of architectural expertise on the Yangguang Continent. The entire building was semi-circular, facing Talu Square like a gaping maw collecting wealth. The entire building was completely covered in gold. The four characters \"Hualong Hotel\" each occupied an area of about a zhang² square. Their gleaming golden splendor was especially prominent under the sunlight. Although only four female attendants were responsible for reception at the entrance, their quality was much higher than those at Dachengxuan. They were all around 1.75 meters tall, their slender figures were so captivating beneath their white dresses, and their beautiful faces were pure and lovely. Although not as stunning as Feng Nu, they could all be considered high-class beauties.\n\nArriving at the hotel entrance, Nian Bing was about to go in, but he was stopped by an elder sister. With a captivating smile on her pretty face, she said, \"Sir, I'm sorry, but due to the Hualong Culinary Competition, our hotel is temporarily closed for business.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, and his handsome face caused the woman to momentarily freeze in a daze. \"Hello, I'm here to register.\" The young lady was clearly the best of the four at the entrance, both in demeanor and appearance. After a slight moment of disorientation, she immediately recovered and said with some surprise, \"Are you participating in this competition? But, you're so young...\" The golden age for a chef is between forty and fifty, as both their physical condition and the time and experience accumulated in culinary training are at their best. Although there were also young people participating in this competition, they were extremely rare, and only one young person had ever reached the semifinals before.\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Is there an age limit for the competition? As the saying goes, 'ambition is not determined by age,'³ and the standard of culinary skill is not measured by it.\"\n\nThe young lady bowed slightly and said, \"I apologize, sir, it was my mistake. Please follow me.\" Her gentle service attitude immediately made Nian Bing's impression of her greatly increase. He nodded with a smile and followed the young lady into the Hualong Hotel.\n\nUpon entering, there was a massive hall. The center of the hall was clearly for reception. And on both sides, hundreds of tables were arranged. The decor was mainly golden, complemented by clean red carpets, making it look exceptionally magnificent. Just the circle of pillars around the hall, carved with golden dragons, had an unimaginable value. The craftsmanship was incredibly exquisite; even the dragon's scales could be clearly seen.\n\nLed by the attendant young lady, Nian Bing was directly led to the second floor. According to this attendant, the entire second floor was the Hualong Hotel's kitchen.\n\nIndeed, when they arrived on the second floor, Nian Bing was stunned by the scene before him. The entire second floor was composed entirely of kitchens. It was divided into several sections. The largest section was where ordinary chefs cooked. At this moment, the preliminary rounds of the Hualong Culinary Competition were being held here. At least a hundred chefs were diligently working to make an appearance on that huge circular platform and advance to the semifinals. And nearby, many more people were waiting. Beside the chefs who were currently cooking, some people in blue clothes were patrolling back and forth. Each person held a clipboard, continuously writing something on it.\n\n\"Sir, look, this is the competition area. The innermost part is the judging panel. After you finish a dish, you send it over for tasting and evaluation, which will determine if you can participate in the semifinals,\" the beautiful attendant explained to Nian Bing. Nian Bing's handsome appearance made her speak a bit more than usual.\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"What about the separated sections? Are those also kitchens?\"\n\nThe beautiful attendant said, \"Yes, that's where our Hualong Hotel's senior chefs cook. For this competition, our Hualong Hotel has also sent three chefs to participate, and they have all already entered the semifinals. Alright, I'll take you to register now.\"\n\nLed by her, the two arrived at a small room beside the kitchen hall. Inside the room sat an old man, appearing to be sixty or seventy years old. He was lazily leaning⁴ back in his chair, dozing off. His appearance was very ordinary, no different from any other old man, except for a small fleshy bump on his forehead. Seeing this, Nian Bing's heart couldn't help but stir.\n\nThe beautiful attendant walked up to the old man and respectfully said, \"Old Man Ling, someone is here to register.\"\n\nThe old man opened his eyes and immediately showed a kindly smile upon seeing the young lady. \"Oh, lass, it's you again! Aren't you tired from standing outside? I told Fatty Hua a long time ago to give you a different job, but you insisted on staying. Really, it's not good for your skin, you pretty young girls always standing outside.\"\n\nThe young lady smiled slightly and said, \"Thank you for your concern. If you have time, wouldn't it all be made up for if you cooked us some good food?\"\n\nNian Bing stepped forward and said, \"Hello, I would like to register for the competition.\"\n\nThe old man's gaze turned to Nian Bing, and seeing his handsome appearance, he couldn't help but frown slightly. \"Registering, are we? What's your name, and do you have any culinary specialties? This is a cooking competition; we don't accept registrations from pastry chefs or cold dish artists.\"\n\n\"My name is Nian Bing, and I don't have any particular specialty. I can cook most general dishes.\"\n\nThe old man pursed his lips. \"Young man, quite the boast, aren't you! Alright, I'd like to see what you're capable of. Registration for this competition is free, but you need to pass my test to proceed.\" As he spoke, he pulled a smooth wooden plaque from under the table and handed it to Nian Bing, saying, \"No matter what method you use, neatly carve your name onto it. You have the time of ten breaths.\"\n\nNian Bing took the wooden plaque but did not make a move. His gaze fell upon the old man's hands. Those were hands that absolutely should not appear on someone his age. The old man's hands were long and slender, fair, and emitted a faint, glowing⁵ light.\n\nHis nails were meticulously trimmed. Although his hands did not have prominent knuckles, Nian Bing clearly sensed that these hands were filled with explosive power. Subconsciously, he exclaimed softly, \"Spirit Chef Na Yan.\"\n\nHearing these four words, the old man's eyes blazed with light, and his previous disdain completely vanished. \"You know me?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"I didn't expect to meet you here, Venerable Elder. Let me complete your test first.\" Holding the wooden plaque in his left hand, he extended his right index finger, and a faint blue light condensed on it. Nian Bing made a single stroke, and two characters, like iron strokes and silver hooks, appeared on the wooden plaque. The two characters were naturally formed, without any trace of carving, yet they were deeply embedded within the wooden plaque.\n\nSpirit Chef Na Yan did not look at the wooden plaque in Nian Bing's hand but instead scrutinized him from head to toe. \"Not many people can recognize me. I don't think we've met before. How did you do it?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"It's not difficult. Spirit Chef seems to have two other titles: 'Two-Headed Chef' and 'Jade Hand Chef.'⁶ Although these two nicknames are far less renowned than 'Spirit Chef,' I saw these two characteristics in you. With a bold guess, I hit the mark.\"\n\nNa Yan looked deeply at Nian Bing. \"In that case, you must be the disciple of an old friend. People who know these two nicknames of mine are quite rare. Who is your master?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Venerable Spirit Chef, you don't need to ask me now. You'll understand naturally after you watch my competition. It's not out of disrespect that I don't say it, but out of fear of diminishing my master's reputation. Excuse me, where should I participate in the preliminary rounds?\" As he spoke, he extended his hand towards Na Yan.\n\nAt this moment, the female attendant beside them realized that Nian Bing's hands were extremely similar to Na Yan's. They were equally long, slender, and radiant, even surpassing them slightly in luster.\n\nNa Yan's eyes flashed repeatedly. \"I didn't expect to meet a disciple of an old friend. Young man, you're very interesting. Ling Dang, take him directly to the semifinals registration. Just tell them I said so. He doesn't need to participate in the preliminary rounds.\"\n\nThe attendant Ling Dang was stunned for a moment and said, \"Old Man Ling, isn't this improper? It doesn't follow the rules.\"\n\nNa Yan smiled calmly and said, \"My test *is* the assessment, lass. If you go and watch the competition, you'll understand what I mean. Young man, you must work hard. I hope to see you in the finals. Don't be careless; among the people participating in this competition, there are some whom even I am not confident I can defeat.\"\n\nNian Bing was startled. For Spirit Chef God, ranked fourth among the Five Great Chef Gods⁷, to say this, it showed how strong the competition opponents were. He immediately nodded in agreement.\n\nLing Dang took Nian Bing to register, but deep emotion appeared in Spirit Chef Na Yan's eyes. \"Old Ghost, it's been decades.

    "content": "Successfully qualifying for the semi-finals, Nian Bing was scheduled for the second day of the official competition. He only found out after asking that hardly anyone was signing up anymore. Over the past ten days, a total of over 130 chefs had entered the semi-finals. After a culinary display on the outdoor circular platform, only ten people would advance to the final after a comprehensive evaluation, competing together on the last day to determine the rankings. The competition format was simple: the preliminary round involved processing ingredients specified by Hualong, while the semi-finals required making a signature dish. The final round would consist of three contests: the first would be processing ingredients selected by Hualong staff, the second would involve finalists fulfilling various requirements set by the judges, and the final contest would be free play.\n\nHolding the marked wooden token, Nian Bing left the Hualong Hotel. Since his competition was tomorrow, he might as well watch others compete today. Nian Bing wasn't worried at all about what signature dish to make tomorrow; after all, a chef of his caliber had no flaws when it came to confidence. Nian Bing's biggest gain today was encountering Spirit Chef Na Yan. Zha Ji once told him that while the Five Great Kitchen Gods were initially ranked, the actual culinary gap between them was very small. Each had their own unique specialties. Nian Bing now truly wanted to witness Na Yan's cooking skills; competing with culinary masters was the only way to help him the most.\n\nThe semi-finals at Taru Plaza were in full swing. When Nian Bing arrived at the plaza again, he couldn't squeeze through the crowd to watch up close. The surging crowd wasn't clamorous or noisy*, it seemed everyone here understood that only by giving the chefs the best environment could they witness superb culinary skills. Fortunately, Nian Bing's eyesight was astonishing since he ate the snake gall. Although it was a long distance, he could still barely see clearly.\n\nUpon observation, Nian Bing was surprised to find that every chef who made it to the semi-finals possessed considerable strength. Not just their practiced techniques, but the sheer spiritual flair they displayed in their cooking was incomparable to ordinary chefs. Various glimpses of magnificent culinary artistry were constantly displayed on the competition stage. Seeing this, Nian Bing not only didn't retreat in the slightest, but became greatly excited. He knew that his decision to participate in the competition was absolutely correct. Every chef here had something he could learn from.\n\nAdvanced chefs, after all, were not comparable to ordinary chefs. Although there were only ten people cooking on stage, due to the appropriate height of the competition stage, combined with their profound culinary skills, the aroma surprisingly covered most of Taru Plaza.\n\nThe competition proceeded round by round. Because the competition stage was constantly rotating slowly, Nian Bing couldn't possibly clearly see everyone's movements. However, just observing parts had given him significant enlightenment. Especially some chefs' unique methods used during cooking filled him with great admiration.\n\nWhen the semi-finals reached the fifth round, Nian Bing's eyes lit up. He saw a young man about his age. Although this person's appearance was ordinary, a familiar feeling emanated from him. As the fifth semi-final round began, everyone else was busy cooking their signature dishes, but he didn't move, instead focusing intently on the simple vegetables on the kitchen counter. His gaze was calm, yet extremely focused, as if trying to see through the vegetables on the counter. Seeing his expression, Nian Bing knew he had encountered the strongest opponent since his debut, apart from Zi Xiu. He was too familiar with that expression; it was something only top-tier chefs possessed!\n\nPerhaps sensing Nian Bing's focused gaze, the young man raised his head, his gaze meeting Nian Bing's. The light in their eyes sparked intensely in the air. The young man pursed his lips, the corners turning up, and cast a provocative look at Nian Bing. Nian Bing looked at him calmly. At this moment, the young man's hand moved.\n\nA phantom, Nian Bing saw a phantom in his eyes. The young man's simple right hand surprisingly created a blur in the air. In an instant, the vegetables that were originally on the kitchen counter had all disappeared. Meanwhile, his gaze was still fixed on Nian Bing. Hand blurs permeated, and aside from not obstructing his gaze, which was like a cold star, they completely obscured the young man's body, as if thousands of hands were constantly waving. Each wave would bring forth several colors, which were the colors of the vegetables.\n\nThe crowd below also noticed this peculiar scene, their gazes immediately focusing on the young man. Nian Bing inwardly exclaimed, \"Phantom Severing Thousand-Cut Hand!\" He hadn't expected to see one of the culinary world's Seven Forbidden Hands in this competition. This Phantom Severing Thousand-Cut Hand ranked fifth among the Seven Forbidden Hands, slightly below the Water-Breaking Jade-Face Mysterious Hand. From the opponent's proficiency and his fluid, unconstrained movements, Nian Bing could clearly feel that this young man had completely mastered the essence of the Thousand-Cut Hand. Needless to say, this person was certainly a genius chef.\n\nWhen Nian Bing wanted to see what this person could do, it was already a bit late, because the circular platform had already carried him in another direction as it rotated. By the time the circular platform rotated back again, the young man had already stopped his hand movements and quietly left the platform, only a plate of vibrant vegetables remaining. Looking at this dish, Nian Bing knew this young man could definitely enter the final on the last day. Not only because of the appearance of the Thousand-Cut Hand, but the perfect combination of vegetables and oil alone told him everything.\n\nThe fifth semi-final round concluded; the results would only be announced on the second day of the competition. Just before the sixth semi-final round was about to begin, Nian Bing's spiritual energy suddenly stirred. He felt someone watching him. He subconsciously turned his head to look, only to find the young man who had previously used the Phantom Severing Thousand-Cut Hand not far behind him, watching him, a gentle smile appearing on his face.\n\nNian Bing turned around and slowly walked towards the young man. The two gazed at each other. As they got closer, Nian Bing more clearly sensed the young man's extraordinary nature. His ordinary appearance nonetheless exuded an ethereal temperament. His hands were large, somewhat disproportionate to his body, with fingernails about an inch long. The nails were translucent like jade, looking extremely clean. Nian Bing knew that those skilled in the Phantom Severing Thousand-Cut Hand wouldn't use kitchen knives; their hands were the best tools.\n\n\"Hello, your performance just now was splendid,\" Nian Bing took the initiative to greet him.\n\nThe young man smiled faintly and said, \"To be watching him from the start, I presume you are also one of us?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"My semi-final is tomorrow.\"\n\nThe young man smiled slightly and said, \"My name is Xiao Tian.\"\n\n\"My name is Nian Bing. It's a pleasure to meet you. I believe we'll meet in the finals.\"\n\nXiao Tian smiled confidently; although his smile was a bit provocative, it wasn't unlikable. \"With me here, I'm afraid you can only be third. I'll go all out in the finals.\"\n\n\"Third place?\" Nian Bing looked at him with some surprise.\n\nXiao Tian gestured with his chin towards the semi-final stage and said, \"Although I haven't seen your skills, I don't think you'll surpass her. But I believe she won't be able to defeat me.\"\n\nNian Bing turned back to look; the sixth semi-final round had already begun. Without Xiao Tian needing to point it out, he already understood who Xiao Tian was talking about. It was a young girl, with an appearance as ordinary as Xiao Tian's, and her pristine white chef's uniform looked incredibly clean. The girl on stage wasn't intently observing like Xiao Tian, but a faint light-shadow rose before her. It was a soft and bright light-shadow. It wasn't magic. The light-shadow was created by her pair of nimble small hands.\n\nIf Xiao Tian's hands were characterized by their large size, then this girl's hands were characterized by their smallness. Her small hands, white as jade, were exceptionally fair. In front of her was a head of cauliflower. Under the action of those small hands, the cauliflower was being broken into uniform small pieces. And that light-shadow was precisely due to her incredible speed, combined with the luster on her hands being illuminated by sunlight.\n\nNian Bing said with some astonishment, \"This must be the Snowfall Heavenly Spirit Hand! This is Spirit Chef Na Yan's lost technique!\"\n\nThe Snowfall Heavenly Spirit Hand ranked sixth among the Seven Forbidden Hands. It was a technique for effectively dividing any ingredient. It was said that any ingredient separated by the Heavenly Spirit Hand would become imbued with spirituality. Of course, Nian Bing knew this statement was incorrect. In fact, the Heavenly Spirit Hand's greatest characteristic was to fully bring out the inherent qualities of the ingredients in an instant, making it the best preparation technique before cooking. From the perspective of ingredient preparation alone, it surpassed the Thousand-Cut Hand. However, the Thousand-Cut Hand had a wider range of applications, which was why it was ranked above it.\n\nThe girl's movements weren't ostentatious, far less flashy than Xiao Tian's earlier technique. But her serenity amidst simplicity clearly told Nian Bing that this was another extremely strong opponent. Furthermore, she must have an inseparable relationship with Spirit Chef Na Yan.\n\nIf Zi Qingmeng had only learned three-tenths of Zi Xiu's culinary skills, then Nian Bing could be certain that this girl possessed at least eighty percent or more of Spirit Chef Na Yan's strength. No wonder Na Yan hadn't participated in the competition himself; it turned out he already had a suitable successor. It seemed there were indeed opponents among the younger generation!\n\n\"Her name is Momo, and she is Spirit Chef Na Yan's niece. She began learning culinary arts with Na Yan from the age of five. It is said that in some aspects, she has not only fully inherited Na Yan's culinary skills but even surpassed them. Coming here to participate in the Hualong Challenge, she has always been my greatest opponent. Of course, now there's also you. Even so, I will still win,\" Xiao Tian's voice, coming from behind, was full of confidence.\n\nNian Bing turned back and glanced at him, then said calmly, \"Let's see the truth on the competition stage. Anything said now is superfluous.\" After speaking, he turned and walked out of the plaza. For him, there was no longer any need to keep watching. He had already seen what he needed to see, and Xiao Tian's challenge ignited a surging fighting spirit within Nian Bing.\n\nWatching Nian Bing's departing back, Xiao Tian smiled faintly. \"As expected of someone I consider an opponent. It seems the culinary world is indeed producing new talents! His hands seem very distinctive; I just don't know what he excels at.\"\n\nJust as Nian Bing had left, two more people appeared in the viewing stand. A middle-aged man in white robes, accompanied by a petite young girl, stepped onto the main platform and sat down beside Demon Marshal Huguang.\n\nHuguang turned his head to look, a smile of excitement on his face. \"Old Xi, you're finally here.\"\n\n\"Don't look at me with that kind of gaze. Don't you think you're disgusting?\" The middle-aged man's opening words startled everyone in the VIP section. It wasn't the first time they had seen someone dare to speak to the Demon Marshal like that.\n\nHuguang seemed not to grasp the sarcasm, chuckling as he said, \"Old Xi, long time no see. You're still the same, but I didn't expect you'd actually come. That's not like your style at all!\"\n\nThe middle-aged man grumbled, \"Do you think I wanted to come? I was just pestered relentlessly by this girl, Maomao, until I had no choice.\" The middle-aged man was none other than the continent's sole Dragon Summoner, Hilarad, and accompanying him was naturally his beloved daughter, Maomao.\n\nMaomao blinked her pair of cute, big eyes at Huguang, \"Little Demon Serpent, I just happen to be missing a little snake among my small pets…\"\n\nHuguang seemed somewhat afraid of Maomao, his expression shifting as he forced a smile, \"Maomao, you should be calling me Uncle.\"\n\nMaomao looked at him curiously and said, \"But even Papa isn't clear whether you're an uncle or an aunt! Papa said a man who doesn't like women can't be called Uncle. Little Demon Serpent, I heard your Demon Snake Guard has more people now. Will you take me to play with them?\"\n\nA chill went down Huguang's spine. He clearly remembered the last time Maomao \"played\" in his Demon Snake Guard, famous throughout the Huarong Empire. It seemed a fox had randomly urinated in the guard's quarters, which resulted in attracting a Master-level magical beast, causing the entire Demon Snake Guard to be thrown into utter chaos**, especially some who accidentally drank water from a water vat where the fox had urinated, had to lie down for a full month before regaining their combat strength. In his eyes, Maomao was absolutely a veritable little demoness.\n\n\"Uh… Maomao, I've sent the Demon Snake Guard out on official business. Let's talk about it another time.\"\n\nMaomao blinked her big eyes repeatedly, \"Really? But we clearly saw them when we arrived! I even let Foxy and Moo-Moo go in and play for a bit.\"\n\nHuguang's expression changed dramatically, and he suddenly stood up, looking at Hilarad. Hilarad, however, was watching the chefs competing on the circular platform, as if everything had nothing to do with him. Coughing awkwardly, Huguang said, \"You, you all watch first. I have something to take care of.\" His figure flashed, disappearing from sight, leaving behind a faint silver light where he had been.\n\nMaomao giggled, \"Papa, Little Demon Serpent is so funny. His face turned so white.\"\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n*   Literally \"not salty noisy.\" This is highly likely a typo in the original text for \"喧囂嘈雜\" (xuānxiāo zá luàn), meaning \"clamorous and noisy.\"\n**   Literally \"chickens flying and dogs jumping,\" an idiom describing a scene of utter chaos and turmoil.",

    "content": "Hillard looked at his beloved and said, \"Just make me trouble. Although Arc Light is not like a man in some aspects, his strength is definitely in the top ten in the Huarong Empire. I'm afraid he can only do anything to you. Don't tease him again in the future. After all, he is a dignified Yuanxiang.\"\n\n\n\nThe cat snorted and said, \"No, I'm going to tease him. Who told him to claim that I was a goddaughter last time.\"\n\n\n\nHillard said helplessly, \"You are so stupid! As soon as you leave, I will make trouble for me. If I see you and let the fox pee everywhere next time, I will snatch it.\"\n\n\n\nThe cat smiled and said, \"Dad, you won't be there. The fox is very smart. He is the first one in my little girl to enter the second stage. Where do you want it?\"\n\n\n\nHillard glared at the cat and said, \"I regret teaching you to summon the arts more and more. You are so simple that you are afraid that the world will not be in trouble. This time, it is not because of your great progress in mental power and some of the pets that have evolved to the second stage, so I won't take you out for fun. Give me a little more honest, otherwise I will take you home early.\"\n\n\n\nThe cat spitted out his cute little tongue and said, \"Okay, I'm just good at it. But, Dad, will Brother Nianbing come to participate in this Hualong Crafts? If he comes, he will definitely win the championship, right?\"\n\n\n\nHillard hummed and said, \"There are people outside of people, and there is heaven beyond the sky. Although that kid Nianbing is good at cooking art, he may not be able to win everyone.\"\n\n\n\nA confused look appeared in the cat's eyes, and he murmured, \"I don't know what Brother Nian Bing is doing now. I really want to eat the barbecue he made!\"\n\n\n\nHillard said, \"You will never have any chance to see him in the future, don't forget. He is a chef, if you mingle with him, make all your pets into dishes sooner or later.\"\n\n\n\nThe cat said in a voice, \"It won't be true. Brother Nian Bing has the best heart. He won't let the cat hurt.\"\n\n\n\nLooking at the daughter's expression, Hillard was shocked and wondered if he was carrying a cat this time. If he really met Nian Bing, what would he do? Kill him? No, it’s better to go back as early as possible.\n\n\n\nIn a corner of the Talu Plaza, a tall man kept swallowing and swallowing, which attracted curious eyes from the surrounding people.\n\n\n\nThe man was two meters tall and had a gray short look very distinctive. Especially his two black eyes. The eyes are completely black. His body was very thin, looking about thirty years old, and his appearance was like a knife and an axe. Although he was very thin, when he saw that his body seemed to be made of steel. Clearly gives people a solid feeling.A black trouser looked a little cold. She held her back with her hands and looked in front of her. At the place where he saw her residence, there was a young girl who was almost the same as a cat. She had a dark blue length, combed into a seed and pounded behind her. Her big ink green eyes looked extremely motivated. She looked unhealthy than her fair skin, and a vicious smile was hanging on her delicate little face. It was a smile that was not as good as her age could show.\n\n\n\n\"Brother Pingchao, I want to eat what they cook, it looks delicious.\" The girl raised her head to the tall man who was much taller than her. \n\n\n\nThe tall man's expression was still cold and hard, and he said lightly: \"No, Miss, I want to ensure your safety.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl dug her mouth apart and suddenly stepped on the tip of Pingchao's feet. At the same time, she used her hand to press hard on the inner side of his thighs. Pingchao's face changed and her white face was slightly twisted, but he didn't move, as if he had become accustomed to the girl's movements.\n\n\n\n\"Everyone said, let you call me Youyou, and then call me Miss, I will pinch you.\" As he said, Youyou glanced at Ping Chao's body with unhappiness and glanced at a certain part of Ping Chao's body.\n\n\n\nPingchao's face changed drastically, and he coughed, \"Yes, Miss, I call you Youyou.\"\n\n\n\nYouyou returned to the competition in the stands with satisfaction, but the evil smile at the corner of her mouth became even more depressed.\n\n\n\nAt this moment, Youyou suddenly saw a small figure running onto the competition platform. No one stopped her. The figure was moving quickly. There was a pair of chopsticks in her hand, constantly stuffing the prepared dishes on the table into her mouth, stuffing them one by one, and muttering something. An angry look appeared in Youyou's eyes, and he stomped Pingchao's feet, \"Look, look, why can't she go up and eat? I can't. I don't care, I want to eat too.\" As he said, he was about to walk towards the crowd.\n\n\n\nThe huge black cloak of the flat tide spread out, and the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the silence of the s\n\n\n\nYouyou glared at Ping Chao with hatred, and pouted her mouth but it finally didn't respond. She used her hand to pinch Ping Chao in a convenient place. Then she was unwilling to accept it and turned away unwillingly. Before leaving, she glared at the small girl on the stage with a fierce look, and she had already figured it out in her heart. \n\n\n\nThe cats were eating delicious food on the stage. They ate one side and criticized the chef's art. Most of them only had one comment, \"I don't think that Brother Bing made it delicious.\"\n\n\n\nThere are many people responsible for maintaining safety, but when the cats came on stage, no one stopped her. It was not that she didn't want to stop her, but when the cats passed by them, the guards felt confused in their brains, and they actually watched her walk up with their eyes silence.\n\n\n\nThe last cat food object was Momo who Xiaotian praised before, \"Wow, sister, the dishes you cook are so delicious! So soft and fragrant.\"\n\n\n\nMomo looked at the girl in front of him with some surprise and smiled, \"Is it delicious? Then you can eat more.\"\n\n\n\nAt this time, the guards had already seen the cat, the cat, and they rushed to the rooftop. The cat stuffed two bites of cauliflower into their mouths, and smiled at Momo, \"Sister, I'll eat what you cook next time, I'll leave first.\" After saying that, he jumped down the rooftop. When she had been through those cares, things happened again. The guards watched her leave in a daze with their old eyes.\n\n\n\nIf you change one person. The people below may be out of full capacity, but the cat is really too cute. Every action will make the spokesperson feel sad, and no one is dissatisfied because of her.\n\n\n\nHillard looked at the daughter running back and said in a deep voice: \"I'm telling you that your spiritual magic is just for you to steal food?\"\n\n\n\nThe cat grabbed his father's soft and thick big hand and said, \"Mom is not a cat that often says this family is a foodie. Dad, if you are mad at me, I will tell my mother when I go back. She will let you sleep on the floor.\"\n\n\n\nHillard's muscles swelled up. \"You. You will use your mother to press me.\"\n\n\n\nThe cat smiled and said, \"Mom said you have gastrointestinal inflammation. Dad, what does gastrointestinal inflammation mean?\"\n\n\n\nHillard was speechless, and as a powerful dragon caller, he could do nothing. I'm afraid there's only my daughter and wife. If they were broadcasting two, he would be even more disappointing.\n\n\n\nAfter leaving the Talu Plaza, Nian Bing didn't go far, so she found a hotel nearby and stayed in. The last time she sold the lobby, there was still a lot left. Although the hotels here were expensive, he didn't care much. Fortunately, the hotel was worth the money. The clean and tidy environment and the large room shining with sunlight brought Nian Bing a lot of good feelings. After eating something simply, he put on the lap, meditated, and recalled what happened today.\n\n\n\nXiaotian and Momo, they are good at long-term Phantom Division Thousand Cut Hands and Bai Xuefang Zero Heavenly Spirit. The Heavenly Spirit is the ultimate skill of the Spiritual Chef, and this cutting hand is not good at long by any of the five great chef gods. Xiaotiandi is still a mystery to Nian Binglai, but From Xiaotian's strong self-confidence Bing, it can be seen that his cooking art is not just as simple as Qianqiu's hand. However, Nian Bing did not have too many thoughts because of the other party's confidence. After all, he thought in his heart that no matter how strong Xiaotian's cooking art is, it cannot be compared with the Child God Zi Xiu.\n\n\n\n   Open the thoughts in his heart, Nian Bing closed his eyes and entered a deeper meditation realm, leaving only a piece of mental power to remain vigilant outside his body. Before meditating, he had already used magic scroll to lay a boundary around his body. Since he obtained the six-pointed lights of the magic weapon, the Xuanhuan Knife, his creations on the magic weapon suddenly rushed forward. After all, with more understanding of space, the magic weapon can be engraved and unchanged.Since I made the same origin and made a breakthrough, meditation for a long time every day has become Nian Bing's habit. He is not a person who likes peace, but the benefits brought by meditation are too obvious. The attraction of magic elements produced by the same origin of ice and fire has been extremely strong, which makes him achieve twice the result with half the effort during the meditation process. Effects, you will have a new feeling after each meditation, and your magic power is significantly improving. It is precisely because of these reasons that Nian Bing's interest in meditation for a long time has greatly increased. Before participating in the Magician New Summit Competition, he must go to Tiandu City as soon as possible and conduct closing meditation at that time until the competition begins.\n\n\n\nMeditation made Nian Bing's spirit unusually concentrated, and the two red and blue magic elements kept pouring towards his body. In the best state of magic, his magic power was increasing one by one. Now he has completely stabilized the magic commander's cultivation. Time has always been very fast in meditation. Unconsciously, the sky outside has darkened, the sun has disappeared, and the night has become deep.\n\n\n\nNian Bing, who was meditating, suddenly felt a little mentally. A magic wave woke him up from meditation, and opened his eyes quietly. The darkness in the room could not affect his vision, and his mental power was released, and he was carefully feeling the wave of the magic.\n\n\n\nThe waves of magic bring a cold feeling. The goal is not me, but toward the east of the tower city. It is so late. Why are there still magicians acting? Moreover, from the perspective of the other party's magic wave movement, it is not like an ordinary magician. Is it a wind-type magician? No, the cold feeling was not the few magics I had already contacted, it seemed to have evil breath. Is it hard to be a dark magician? When he thought of the dark magician, Nian Bing remembered the stolen Meordas seal bottle. In curiosity, he pushed open the window and applied a violent snow on himself. He suddenly raised his mind and chased towards the magic wave. \n\n\n\nNian Bing flew very high, feeling his current magic power and mental control. Feng Fengxue had been able to maintain it for a long time. With the feeling of mental power, he soon caught up with the evaluation of the scattered magic waves. They were two people. The body in front was covered by a large black cloak. She looked not tall. Her body seemed to be flying around, and she did not feel like she was jumping. Behind him, she was a tall man, with the tip of her feet shifting at least ten feet at every point, and followed the man in front easily. The magic wave that Nian Bing felt before was the one who came out of it.\n\n\n\nSeeing the true appearance of the two people, he was even more sure that the dark air was scattered on these two people. There seemed to be a faint black air scattering on their bodies, and the cold air was full of evil.\n\n\n\nNian Bing did not surprise them, and quietly followed in the far air. He took out the Xuanhuan sword from the ring of space, and used the same source of ice and fire as the guide. He used the Xuanhuan sword to completely calm his breath. In Talu City, a dark magician appeared. What are they going to fuck?The time was not long, and the two people suddenly stopped. The man in front took off the cloak from his head, revealing the dark blue color. The place where they stopped was a hotel that looked very much. The blue girl looked around and saw that there were no pedestrians. Then she stretched out her white little hand and carved something on the wall. Nian Bing looked away, shocking that it was a magical aquarium that he had never seen before. The faint black fog kept escaping from the magical aquarium and headed towards the hotel.\n\n\n\nJudging from the other party's magic wave, the magic power is not very powerful, but this dark magic is indeed very strange. The mist is heading towards a direction in the hotel as if it is alive. \n\n\n\nNian Bing felt a little hesitant, shouldn’t he come forward? The Dark Magicians are very rare on the mainland, or they may find some traces about the bottle of the Mergokudas Seal.\n\n\n\nAt this moment, a low roar sounded, \"Moo, moo---\"\n\n\n\nThe black fog that was swept into the hotel and flew back. The girl was shocked and turned to look at her companion. The door of the hotel opened, and a naive and lazy voice sounded, \"Who is this nagging, I'm sleeping in the middle of the night,\" the cat, who was a little arrogant, walked out of the side of the door, and happened to meet the dark maid.",

    "content": "When Maomao appeared, Nian Bing, in the distant sky, couldn't help but be startled. He had an excellent impression of Maomao, that adorable little girl, and a surge of joy filled his heart at her appearance. But then, a thought struck him, and he realized that the Dark Mage was targeting Maomao. Where was Shilade? Could it be that Maomao had snuck out on her own again?\n\nYouyou was truly annoyed. She had woken up intending to use her skilled hypnosis to put Maomao to sleep, then drag her out and prank her thoroughly. But unexpectedly, her hypnosis had no effect whatsoever; instead, it drew the other girl out. Youyou twisted around and shot a glance at Pingchao, then, head held high, said, \"Little girl, you dared to sneak food during the day. I'm going to teach you a lesson.\"\n\nMaomao rubbed her sleepy eyes and looked at Youyou. \"Who are you calling a little girl? Are you older than me?\"\n\nYouyou let out a hmph. A flash of light in her hand revealed a small magic staff. The staff was about a foot long, with a sparkling blue gem set at its tip. As soon as the staff appeared, a faint black mist began to swirl around Youyou.\n\n\"Oh?\" Maomao also noticed the change in her opponent. But instead of being scared, she excitedly cried out, \"A Dark Mage! Daddy said Dark Mages are the hardest to deal with. And today I get to meet two! This is great. Hey, who are you?\"\n\nYouyou still held her head high and said, \"I am Youyou, the Super Witch, loved by all, beautiful and generous, gentle and evil. And you?\"\n\nMaomao stuck out her tongue, not to be outdone, and said, \"What 'Super Witch'? At most, just a little witch. As for me, I am Maomao, the gentle and lovely, breathtakingly beautiful, stunningly gorgeous<sup>[1]</sup> Super Summoner!\"\n\nYouyou was stunned for a moment. \"You're a Summoner?\" she asked, surprised.\n\nMaomao said proudly, \"Scared now, aren't you?\"\n\nYouyou scoffed. \"Scared of nothing! You can only summon a cow. Let me show you my power. Lost lamb! Under the guidance of great darkness. Awaken, for darkness shall...\"\n\nYouyou's incantation was only halfway chanted when a white light suddenly flashed in Maomao's eyes. A not-so-strong yet piercing sound abruptly interrupted Youyou's spell, and the dark magic elements she had condensed dispersed with it.\n\nPingchao cried out softly, \"Mental magic! Miss—oh no, Youyou, be careful.\"\n\nYouyou said indignantly, \"What's the big deal? All you did was interrupt my magic. Hey, Maomao, if you're so capable, find somewhere private and let's have a match. If you lose, you have to acknowledge me as your older sister. And you have to give me the best of everything first.\"\n\nUpon hearing Youyou's words, Pingchao nearly choked on his own spit. Great Moon Lord! Why is your daughter like this?\n\nMaomao huffed irritably. \"Who cares about you? I still need to sleep. How much time would it even take to deal with you? Cow, attack!\"\n\nCow's enormous black-and-white body suddenly reared up. Maomao gripped its two cow ears to stabilize herself as eight beams of white light shot out, heading straight for Youyou and Pingchao.\n\nPingchao's figure flickered, blocking Youyou. His large black cloak rose horizontally, deflecting the eight white lights. In an instant, Pingchao's eyes turned an eerie red, and his body seemed to expand a few sizes. Two fangs protruded from his mouth as he stared at Maomao, seemingly ready to launch an attack at any moment.\n\nMaomao couldn't help but feel a little scared looking at Pingchao's red eyes. She took a step back and quickly chanted, \"By my Xiyun's name, I summon you, come forth, my pet, Tiantian!\"\n\n\"By my Xiyun's name, I summon you, come forth, Shidi's pet, Nana!\"\n\n\"By my Xiyun's name, I summon you, come forth, my pet, Guanguan!\"\n\nInstantly, an enormous rat, a shameless fox, and a pink and tender piglet appeared one after another in faint glows.\n\nSeeing this, Nian Bing in the sky couldn't help but smile. Half a year later, Maomao still had these beloved pets protecting her. However, their attack power truly wasn't very strong; only the piglet Guanguan seemed a bit formidable.\n\nThe fox, Nana, upon its first appearance, immediately leaped onto Cow's head. It seemed to sense danger too, blinking its small eyes and looking around. The fox had changed somewhat since Nian Bing last saw it; its body had grown a bit, and its fiery red fur looked glossier. Especially its eyes, darting around, appeared exceptionally cunning.\n\nSeeing the fox, Nian Bing immediately recalled how it had once urinated to attract the Golden-backed Earth Dragon King. Wasn't Shilade planning to make that Earth Dragon King Maomao's pet? Why hadn't Maomao summoned it?\n\nYouyou pushed Pingchao away and looked at Maomao curiously. \"Are these all your summoned beasts? They're so cute!\"\n\nMaomao said proudly, \"Of course they are! They're my four summoned beasts. How about it, scared now? If you're willing to acknowledge me as your older sister, I'll let you off. After this, you have to give me the good food first.\"\n\nYouyou scoffed. \"A cow, a pig, a rat, and a fox. What's there to be afraid of? Let me show you my power.\" As she spoke, she reached into her bosom and pulled out a dark green skull. A ghastly green light emanated from the skull, making it look sinister. With a flick of her wrist, Youyou threw the skull. Instantly, loud shrieks filled the air as countless black energy streams gushed from the skull, coiling around Maomao and her pets.\n\nMaomao blinked her adorable large eyes. \"Tiantian, go!\"\n\nThe large rat Tiantian suddenly leaped up. A layer of iron-gray light emanated around its body, its arrow-shaped teeth exposed, as it pounced directly at the skull. The black energy couldn't penetrate the iron-gray light surrounding its body. A hint of disdain appeared in Youyou's eyes as she softly cried, \"Explode!\"\n\nThe charging green skull suddenly halted in mid-air. The black energy currents that had been scattered around it suddenly congealed into a mass, also taking the form of a skull, though much larger than the dark green one. The skull instantly charged forward, directly impacting Tiantian. Tiantian plunged headfirst into the black skull, and the iron-gray light around its body instantly dimmed.\n\nMaomao cried out in alarm and hastily shouted, \"Tiantian, go back! Guanguan, Beast Blood Boil!\"\n\nThe piglet Guanguan leaped out from Maomao's arms. Its originally pink and tender body instantly turned crimson, and a brilliant light burst forth from its tiny pig eyes. In an instant, it emitted a powerful king's aura, its body expanding slightly, and the red glow around it even revealed a faint golden light. It let out a sharp squeal unique to pigs, lowered its head, and charged forward fiercely.\n\nBack then, Guanguan's Beast Blood Boil<sup>[2]</sup> had temporarily repelled the Golden-backed Earth Dragon King. Its impact force was far stronger than that of the large rat Tiantian. The king's aura around its body instantly flared, tearing the black skull to shreds, and its pig head directly impacted the main body of the dark green skull.\n\nWith a bang, the hard black-green skull flew backward. Guanguan's forward momentum remained unchanged, its large rear wiggling in the air as it charged directly at Youyou.\n\nYouyou blinked her eyes. The magic staff in her hand suddenly vanished, and a ghastly green large hand appeared before her. She muttered a few incantations, and the large hand took advantage of Guanguan's charge not being as fierce as it was at the beginning, and the opportunity that its king's aura had also diminished, to grab it.\n\nGuanguan struggled ceaselessly, its pig squeals sounding somewhat piercing. Youyou controlled the large hand to bring Guanguan in front of her, pinched its pig snout, and said, \"You little chubby pig, why are you squealing so much? You dared to knock flying my Greeny-head! I'll spank your butt.\" As she spoke, she pinched Guanguan's small tail with one hand, lifting it upside down, and used her small hand to firmly spank its pink and tender pig butt a few times.\n\nMaomao angrily said, \"Don't bully my little pet!\"\n\nYouyou scoffed and spanked Guanguan twice more. \"I insist on bullying it, so what? Why don't you admit defeat and call me older sister, and I'll let it go.\"\n\nMaomao was greatly anxious, unsure what to do, when she suddenly saw Guanguan's body turn red again. A look of excitement suddenly appeared on her originally anxious little face. \"Go ahead and hit it! Guanguan is always disobedient anyway. You can even consider it teaching it a lesson for me!\"\n\nYouyou was stunned for a moment. Just then, Pingchao, who had been standing by Youyou's side the entire time, suddenly let out a low shout, \"Be careful!\" He stepped forward and abruptly severed the connection between Youyou and the magic-conjured large hand. He swung his right palm, an explosion rang out, and Guanguan<sup>[3]</sup> along with the magic hand, flew up simultaneously.\n\nIn an instant, the inky black night seemed to be visited by light, as dazzling golden light instantly burst forth. The ghastly green magic hand was completely blown to pieces, and the pink and tender Guanguan floated quietly in mid-air. Its originally chubby body had doubled in size, and a golden king's aura continuously flared, its powerful sensation even felt by Nian Bing in the distant sky.\n\n\"Yay! Guanguan, you've finally evolved to Tier 2! This is great!\" Maomao excitedly cheered.\n\n\"Brother Pingchao, kill that hateful pig for me!\" Youyou's shock was replaced by anger, and she looked at Guanguan in the sky with hatred.\n\nPingchao moved. His tall body, like a black bolt of cold lightning, rushed towards Guanguan in the air. In an instant, his eyes turned completely blood-red, and black claws grew from the tips of his extended right fingers. An intense dark aura was startling.\n\nSeeing this, Nian Bing couldn't help but be startled. That was Dark Battle Aura! He knew he couldn't just watch anymore. If Maomao was harmed, he would regret it too late.\n\nGuanguan and Pingchao collided. Amidst a piercing pig squeal, Guanguan, who had just entered Tier 2, was sent flying by Pingchao's shockwave before it could even unleash its Beast Blood Boil ultimate technique. Its plump body slid through the air, like a round ball.\n\nMaomao cried out in alarm, leaped down from Cow, and shouted, \"Nana, hurry!\"\n\nThe shameless fox cringed its head, then suddenly lifted its leg and urinated some yellow liquid onto Cow's head. The usually docile Cow let out an angry roar, while the shameless fox had already vanished, no one knew where. Cow stood on its hind legs, white light continuously flashing from its underside, as if its milk was endless, and it frantically attacked Youyou in the sky ahead.\n\nA black stellate array formed in front of Youyou, and the ghastly green light around her petite body intensified greatly. \"Tentacles of Darkness, devour all unknown energies!\" Numerous black lights intertwined in front of her, blocking wave after wave of Cow's attacks.\n\nMaomao lowered her head and glanced at the fox hiding behind her. She said, displeased, \"Nana, you're getting naughtier and naughtier! After entering Tier 2, your urine gained the effects of Blood Leeching Art, but you can't use it on Cow! If he gets exhausted, I'll spank your butt and let Little Stutterer torment you.\"\n\nThe fox blinked its eyes. Its shameless demeanor seemed a little scared. It shook its head repeatedly, squeaked twice, and charged forward again.\n\nAlthough Guanguan in the air was sent flying by Pingchao, its body quickly stabilized itself in seconds. A pair of pink wings had actually grown on its back. It steadied itself and charged towards Pingchao again.\n\nNian Bing had already flown over at the same time Guanguan was sent flying. He hadn't expected Guanguan to have wings and fly back. One person and one pig coincidentally collided, and the magic Nian Bing had prepared to attack Pingchao completely exploded on Guanguan. It was the Instant Explosion Technique of the Tier 2 Ice-Fire Fusion Magic. With a thunderous roar, Nian Bing was sent flying high by the recoil force, while the poor Guanguan changed direction, crashing towards the ground like a stray bullet.\n\nDazed and disoriented, Nian Bing subconsciously shouted, \"Holy crap! A Flying Divine Pig!\"\n\nThe coincidences continued. Guanguan's descent and direction were precisely towards Youyou, who was continuously using Tentacles of Darkness to block Cow's attacks. Amidst a thunderous roar, the dark aura was completely shattered by Guanguan's free fall. Youyou cried out in alarm, her petite body, enveloped in a layer of dark green light, floated out. Although she reacted quickly, she still ended up covered in dust and looking disheveled.\n\n\"Dead pig! You dirtied Youyou's clothes! You're dead meat!\" Youyou flew into a rage. Just as she was about to chant a powerful spell, Nian Bing and Pingchao had already descended. Nian Bing stood in front of Maomao. At this moment, the Heaven-Piercing Dawn was held in his hand.\n\nThe golden halo on the blade was especially conspicuous in the night. The sacred light aura dispersed the evil in the darkness. Standing in front of Maomao, Nian Bing was like a God of War, the light emitted by the Sacred Radiance Stone enveloping him in a golden glow.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Pingchao's expression changed drastically as he looked at the blade in Nian Bing's hand. From that exceptionally pure power of light, he felt an irresistible force. He subconsciously retreated in front of Youyou, shielding her body.\n\n---\n<sup>[1]</sup> 國色天香 (guó sè tiān xiāng) and 沉魚落燕 (chén yú luò yàn) are Chinese idioms describing a woman of extraordinary beauty, often translated as \"peerless beauty\" or \"stunningly gorgeous.\"\n<sup>[2]</sup> The character 箅 (bì) is likely a typo for 血 (xuè, blood), given the previous mention of \"獸血沸騰\" (Beast Blood Boil) and the context of the ability.\n<sup>[3]</sup> The character 經 (jīng) is likely a typo for 官 (guān), referring to the piglet Guanguan.",

    "content": "The fox, which had originally charged out, immediately retreated upon seeing someone appear, while the dizzy and disoriented Guanguan also moved to Maomao's side. Only the cow continued to spray incessantly, its jets continuously blocked by Pingchao's waving cape. The fox, that 'spokesperson', was caught in the powerful effect of the enraged urine, which was indeed potent.\n\n\"Brother Nianbing!\" Maomao's voice was filled with pleasant surprise. She pounced from behind, grabbing Nianbing's large hand.\n\nDue to excitement, Maomao's small face flushed crimson. She vigorously shook Nianbing's hand, seemingly forgetting that they were still facing a powerful enemy.\n\nNianbing glanced at Maomao somewhat awkwardly, then immediately stared at Pingchao, asking coldly, \"People from the darkness, why are you attacking my friends?\"\n\nPingchao did not answer Nianbing's question. He looked at the Holy Flame Blade in Nianbing's hand, and suddenly his entire body trembled violently. His upper body hunched forward. Nianbing thought he was about to attack, so he immediately held his long blade horizontally and quickly chanted a spell.\n\n\"Youyou, it's the power of light. Let's leave here first.\" The golden light from the Holy Flame Blade gave Pingchao an unfathomable feeling. Although he was not afraid, he had to consider Youyou.\n\nYouyou's angry eyes stared intently at the little pig Guanguan, her hands constantly patting off the dust from her body. For her, who had a cleanliness fetish, Guanguan's behavior was unforgivable.\n\nPingchao suddenly let out a sharp cry from his mouth. Fine, short fur grew on his body, the fangs beneath his lips became more prominent, and his red eyes were filled with an eerie sensation. Suddenly, his hunched body trembled violently, and two huge wings spread open, emerging from beneath his cape. Seeing this strange sight, Nianbing was momentarily stunned, and the spell he was chanting also paused briefly. Seizing this instant, black mist suddenly surged, and Pingchao's body retreated like lightning. In an illusion, Youyou was already on his back. With a sudden flap of those huge wings, countless black currents, like wind blades, shot towards Nianbing.\n\nNianbing's spell was also completed at this instant. Just as Pingchao feared harming Youyou, he likewise feared Maomao being harmed. He sought no merit, only to avoid fault. Golden light, carrying a sacred aura, suddenly burst forth. The Holy Flame Blade conjured a golden light barrier. As soon as those black currents touched the holy golden light, they vanished without a trace. They didn't even generate much impact. Light is the nemesis of darkness, and this was especially evident on this Holy Flame Blade, which had once been wielded by a Saint Master.\n\nThe dark currents vanished with the golden light. When Nianbing and Maomao looked again, Pingchao had already transformed into a black speck in the night sky, taking Youyou with him. Youyou's resentful voice clearly reached their ears: \"Little dead pig, you wait! I won't let you off! You dirtied my clothes. I'll make you regret ever being a pig in this world!\"\n\nGuanguan suddenly felt a chill run through its body, instinctively shivered, and dodged behind the cow. Its intuition told it that Youyou's words were not merely a simple threat.\n\nBy this time, the cow had stopped its milk spray. It seemed to have consumed a lot of energy, hot air continuously spouting from its nostrils. Its angry cow eyes stared fixedly at the fox not far away.\n\nNianbing did not pursue. In his opinion, people from the dark world had no direct connection or threat to him. As long as they didn't harm his fundamental interests, why make enemies? He already had enough troubles. He turned to look at Maomao, just about to ask a few words of concern. He saw Maomao suddenly leap, and Nianbing felt a tightening around his neck—he had already been hugged by Maomao. Maomao was much shorter than Nianbing; with such a hug, she was practically hanging on him. \"Brother Nianbing, I missed you so much! It's so great to finally see you again!\"\n\nNianbing awkwardly put his arm around Maomao's waist. Although Maomao was only around sixteen, the fresh scent of a young girl on her still caused the hot-blooded Nianbing a wave of panic. \"Maomao, don't be like this. Get down first. Your little pets are still watching.\"\n\n\"No, I won't get down. I want you to hold me. Brother Nianbing, don't you see me as your sister?\" Maomao insisted on clinging to him, refusing to let go no matter what.\n\nHearing the word 'sister', Nianbing's heart, instead, calmed down. 'That's right!' he thought. 'Haven't I always regarded Maomao as my sister? To have such thoughts just now, I deserve a slap!' No longer awkward, he smiled slightly as he held Maomao's delicate body and said, \"Of course not! In Brother Nianbing's heart, you've always been the cutest little sister! Maomao, what happened just now? Why did those two people attack you?\"\n\nMaomao pouted angrily and said, \"Who knows why! That Youyou person called herself a little witch, she was so annoying! I was just about to go to sleep when I encountered her sneak attack. Luckily, my Spirit Magic senses are very sharp, so they didn't succeed in their ambush. The way they left just now was so strange! That big guy seemed to have turned into a beast.\"\n\nNianbing thought for a moment and said, \"Are you sure that was a beast? How can a person turn into a beast? Does that fellow have non-human bloodline?\"\n\nMaomao released her grip on Nianbing's hand, letting him hold her, and shook her head, saying, \"I don't know either, but I could feel that at the moment they left, that person was indeed emitting a beastly aura.\"\n\nNianbing put Maomao down and said, \"First, put away your precious pets. It's not good for outsiders to see them. Oh, right, Maomao, you didn't run out by yourself again, did you?\"\n\nMaomao giggled, waving her hands repeatedly, putting away the little pig, the fox, and the cow. She said, \"Of course not! I'm the best-behaved! This time, I came out with Daddy!\"\n\nHearing that Hilade was also present, Nianbing's heart tightened. He still clearly remembered Hilade's warning to him last time. That unfathomably powerful Dragon Summoner was no ordinary strong individual. However, with such obvious dark aura appearing, and his daughter being the target, why didn't he come out to help? There was no reason for him not to sense it!\n\nMaomao saw Nianbing's thoughts and giggled, \"Daddy went drinking with Uncle Molong, so he wasn't here. Uncle Molong doesn't seem to welcome me much, so he didn't take me along.\" Thereupon, she recounted how she came to Talu City. It turned out that after her father Hilade took her home, no matter how much Hilade pressured her, Maomao just wouldn't properly cultivate Spirit Magic. She was Hilade's apple of his eye, and with her mother supporting her, even if Hilade's magic was stronger, he had no way to deal with her. Finally, Hilade reluctantly promised her that as long as her magic made certain progress, he would take her to travel across the continent. Under this temptation, Maomao finally complied and diligently began learning Spirit Magic. More than half a year passed, and with her excellent innate comprehension, she made considerable progress in Spirit Magic and summoning. It so happened that Marshal Gulong sent an invitation for them to come to Talu City to watch the Hua Long Culinary Challenge. To encourage his daughter, Hilade brought her here.\n\nAfter listening to Maomao, Nianbing was inwardly surprised. The powerful Hilade indeed had a wide circle of acquaintances. Even military bigwigs like Marshal Gulong were his friends. \"Maomao, have you really never seen those two people before? Think hard. Although they use dark power, even people from the darkness wouldn't easily make a move without some purpose, right?\"\n\nMaomao pouted, \"Don't you believe me? I really haven't seen them before! Although that Youyou looked very annoying, she actually helped me this time! Guanguan evolved to second tier! It seems external stimuli are very beneficial for their evolution. From now on, I need to find ways to stimulate them more often.\" Poor pets of hers, oblivious in Maomao's dimensional space, unaware that their upcoming fate would be pitiable.\n\nNianbing's thoughts raced. Maomao wouldn't lie to him. But why did those two people attack her? What exactly was going on? However, judging from their attacks, they didn't seem to intend to kill Maomao. Just as he thought of this, suddenly, his spiritual power vibrated intensely. The immense pressure made him involuntarily take a step back, his gaze instantly locking onto the darkness not far away, and the Holy Flame Blade in his hand was raised again. A tall figure slowly walked out from the darkness. \"Nianbing, why are you here?\"\n\n\"Senior, it's you.\" The newcomer was none other than Hilade. His expression was calm, but his eyes gleamed with a stern light. Maomao also saw her father, but she didn't run over. Instead, she complained, \"Daddy, why did you only just come back? Maomao was bullied just now! Luckily, Brother Nianbing saved me, or else I would have suffered a great loss.\" Maomao's words were naturally somewhat exaggerated. Even if Nianbing hadn't intervened, with her second-tier fox and little pig, it wouldn't have been easy for Youyou and her companion to harm her.\n\nHilade walked to his daughter's side and asked in surprise, \"Someone bullied you? Who was it?\"\n\nMaomao genuinely exaggerated and embellished the previous events, completely describing Youyou as a terrifying witch. Hilade's heart thumped as he listened. He placed a hand on his daughter's shoulder, confirmed Maomao hadn't suffered any harm, and only then let out a sigh of relief. He put his arm around his daughter's shoulder and muttered to himself, \"It's a vampire, it's been many years since I've seen such a creature. Maomao, next time you encounter them, try not to engage. Hmph, to ambush my daughter while I'm away... it seems these dark fellows are stirring again. I just wonder what level this rare vampire is.\"\n\nMaomao asked in surprise, \"A vampire? Isn't that just a bat? Daddy, I want a bat as a pet.\"\n\nHilade frowned slightly and said, \"Vampires are pure dark creatures. They possess the ability to turn into bats, but they are not true bats; they have human bloodlines, so it's impossible for them to become pets. Moreover, the spiritual power of dark creatures is much stronger than that of other elemental creatures. If one is not careful, they can easily be subjected to a backlash. Vampires are very strong in both power and speed. If a Prince-level vampire were present, perhaps only Karodis could deal with it. However, Prince-level vampires are almost impossible to exist, after all, during the Ancient War...\" He paused here before continuing, \"Vampires are not that terrifying. They also have their weaknesses. During the daytime, even the strongest vampires will have their combat power significantly reduced. Our ancestors once raised dark-type pets, and they were called Dark Summoners. However, raising dark-type pets requires a great deal of sacrifice, especially one's own essence blood and soul. Although it can quickly increase power in a short time, it's impossible to become a truly powerful summoner. To have a vampire for protection, that little witch named Youyou must have an extraordinary background. In the future, you must be more careful and try not to leave my side.\"\n\nMaomao said somewhat unconvinced, \"Then why can that little witch have a vampire as a pet?\"\n\nHilade smiled faintly and said, \"Silly girl, theirs isn't a pet, it's more like a servant. Although the dark magic that little girl used wasn't very strong, judging from your description, it should be the most authentic dark magic. Her elders' abilities are probably not beneath mine, so it's natural for her to have a vampire servant.\"\n\nHearing this, Nianbing couldn't help but interject, \"They didn't seem to have any hostility; they didn't really try to kill Maomao.\"\n\nHilade looked up at Nianbing. \"The situation with dark beings is hard to predict. Their thoughts are extreme, and their actions often differ from ordinary people. Why are you here? This seems quite a coincidence!\"\n\nNianbing's anger flared. He knew that Hilade always had reservations about him. Forcibly suppressing his rage, he calmly said, \"Senior Hilade, I came to Talu City to participate in the Hua Long Culinary Challenge. I sensed a dark aura while meditating and followed it out. Maomao has already explained what happened afterward. I've always regarded Maomao as my sister. How could I not act when she was in danger? It's late. You and Maomao should also rest. I'll take my leave.\" After saying this, without waiting for Hilade to ask further, he turned and headed towards his inn.\n\n\"Brother Nianbing, please don't leave!\" Maomao cried out anxiously.\n\nNianbing stopped, looked back at Maomao, and smiled. \"Go back and sleep with your daddy quickly. Girls who sleep too late won't be pretty anymore. Brother has to go back too. Goodbye, Maomao.\" He quickly chanted a spell, and a blizzard lifted his body high into the air, vanishing in the blink of an eye. He was filled with indignation towards Hilade's wariness, and at the same time, it further strengthened his desire for power. He knew clearly that whoever was stronger would have more power. If his own strength could reach the same level as Hilade's, would Hilade still treat him this way?\n\nWatching Nianbing leave, Hilade frowned slightly, thinking to himself, 'He hasn't been seen for just over half a year, yet this kid's strength seems to have grown a lot. Ice-Fire Confluence is truly extraordinary!'",

    "content": "\"Dad, why did you make Brother Nian Bing leave? He saved me, and it's bad enough you didn't thank him, but you were also so cold to him. Nian Bing didn't offend you.\" Mao Mao's voice was filled with indignation.\n\nHilliard sternly said, \"Mao Mao, you must remember, you are a White person. We White people have our own world; it's better to have less contact with outsiders. As the saying goes, 'you know a person's face but not their heart.' The human heart is the hardest thing in the world to see clearly. What you saw was only Nian Bing's good side, but you don't truly understand him. Remember what I told you, you are not allowed to contact him again, understand?\"\n\n\"No, I don't understand.\" Mao Mao protested, \"Brother Nian Bing is so good to me, how could he be a bad person? He was willing to sacrifice himself to save me back then, were those things fake? Dad, you are measuring a gentleman's belly with a petty person's heart.\"[^1]\n\n\"Presumptuous, how dare you speak to your father like that?\" Hilliard's face darkened. If it were anyone else, they would have probably developed fear under his powerful mental pressure. However, Mao Mao could be said to be his nemesis; she looked at her father without backing down, \"I wasn't wrong, Brother Nian Bing *is* good to me. Daddy is so mean! *Wuwu*, Mao Mao doesn't have a brother, and now that I finally recognized one, Daddy is so fierce to him. *Wuwu*, Daddy is so mean, when I go back, I'm going to tell Mommy to make you sleep on the floor for a month, no, three months.\"\n\nHilliard looked at his daughter, utterly helpless against her. However, at this moment, a strong killing intent arose in his heart. He knew very well that although Mao Mao currently only regarded Nian Bing as a brother, if their contact continued, it would be hard to say that Mao Mao wouldn't develop feelings for Nian Bing once she matured. After all, Nian Bing was a top choice in both appearance and strength, naturally possessing a strong attraction to girls. No, he absolutely could not allow such a thing to happen. As his heir, Mao Mao's future husband could only be a White person.\n\n\"Alright, alright. Don't cry. Daddy promises you, if we see Nian Bing again in the future, I'll be nicer to him, how about that?\" While deep in thought, Hilliard comforted his daughter.\n\nMao Mao immediately broke into a smile, embracing Hilliard's arm and saying, \"Daddy is the best! Mao Mao will be a good girl and listen.\" Naive as she was, she had no idea that her plea had brought a deadly disaster upon Nian Bing. Embracing his daughter's delicate body, cold light flickered in Hilliard's eyes. Looking in the direction Nian Bing had disappeared, he had already made his decision.\n\nBack at the hotel, relying on his firm willpower, Nian Bing quickly forgot the previous unpleasantness. He didn't hold a grudge against Hilliard for anything. Hilliard had already made it very clear to him why he wasn't allowed to approach Mao Mao: it was due to the White people's own reasons. After all, only White people could cultivate summoning magic, especially Dragon Summoners like them, who passed down their lineage. Nian Bing's heart was very open; after all, he only regarded Mao Mao as a younger sister. The only women who held a place in his heart now were Chu Chu, the pitifully charming Long Ling, and the peerless beauty Feng Nu.\n\nThe second day of the Huálóng Culinary Challenge was as lively as the first. Today, there were the last six rounds of semifinals. After the final sixty semifinalists finished their competition, the finalists for the last day would be announced. This quadrennial grand event was something no commoner wanted to miss. Although they couldn't taste those wondrous delicacies, they were already quite satisfied just by witnessing the skills of these master chefs.\n\nNian Bing stood at the center of the circular stage and the podium canopy. From afar, he already saw Mao Mao and Hilliard on the podium, but he didn't greet them. He wore the straw hat he had bought earlier, concealing his appearance. He had already asked; his semifinal round was the last of all the semifinals, likely not taking place until after noon. So, he wasn't in a hurry. He decided to observe others' culinary skills first. After a night of meditation, his mental energy had reached its peak state. Being closer to the competition stage today, he could clearly see every movement of the chefs on it. Soon, Nian Bing forgot everything around him, fully immersing himself in the appreciation of the culinary arts. Every chef who could enter the semifinals had something worth learning from him. Although no other culinary masters like Xiao Tian and Mo Mo appeared, these chefs' unique designs and ideas broadened his horizons, directly inspiring many novel thoughts for his own cooking.\n\nWhen one is focused, time often passes the quickest. Unconsciously, the fifth group of semifinals had ended. The MC on stage announced the list of participants for the sixth round of semifinals. When Nian Bing's name was called, he awoke from his immersion in culinary arts, realizing it was his turn to go on stage. He didn't want to easily display his magical culinary skills in front of so many people. Before going on stage, he first took out the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God, tucking them into his bosom. Based on Ice-Fire Affinity, he applied seals to both precious blades, making them appear inconspicuous from the outside, though their magical aura still remained. Walking leisurely onto the stage, Nian Bing was the last one to ascend. As the final group of the semifinals, there were only seven participants, including him. Apart from Nian Bing, the other six were all between thirty and fifty years old, each exuding a calm demeanor and a serene expression, clearly master chefs who had been practicing culinary arts for many years.\n\nThe MC led Nian Bing and the six chefs each to a cooking counter. \"Everyone, you are the last group of the semifinals. If you want to catch up with your colleagues from previous rounds, you must work hard. I'm sure you've observed a lot over the past two days. The rules are the same: various ingredients are in the center of the circular stage, which you can freely take and use to create your most skilled dishes. Then our staff will take them to the podium for judging. The time limit is half a *shichen* (one hour).[^2] Chefs who fail to complete their dishes will be considered to have forfeited. Alright, Day Two of the Semifinals, Group Six, begin now!\"\n\nAs soon as the other six chefs heard the MC announce \"begin,\" they immediately walked towards the central platform where various ingredients were laid out. This circular stage used for the competition was extremely large, and the central storage platform occupied two-thirds of its area. Hundreds of ingredients were neatly arranged in square boxes. On the cooking counters, after the fifth group of chefs finished their cooking, fresh sets of various seasonings had been placed. One could say that everything a chef needed was readily available there. Nian Bing did not rush to choose ingredients like the other chefs. He looked up towards the podium, spotting several familiar faces besides Mao Mao and Hilliard. Chief Chef Na Yan sat at a position on the edge of the podium, and Mo Mo stood behind Na Yan, watching him. Their eyes met. A hint of curiosity appeared in Mo Mo's eyes; she smiled faintly at Nian Bing and nodded. Although her appearance was ordinary, the gentle smile on her face made her very endearing.\n\nNian Bing also nodded back at Mo Mo. Just then, his mental energy stirred slightly, and his gaze shifted to the side, meeting Xiao Tian's eyes. Although Xiao Tian wasn't conspicuous in the crowd, his sharp gaze easily drew the attention of someone with strong mental energy like Nian Bing. Xiao Tian's eyes showed a hint of challenge; he looked at Nian Bing, then at the cooking counter, as if saying, \"Let's see what you've got.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. His gaze returned to his cooking counter. What should he make? Before coming here, driven by strong self-confidence, he hadn't even considered this question. With a slight smile, a divine light flashed in his eyes. He had figured it out. Since Xiao Tian and Mo Mo clearly held back, he absolutely couldn't display his strongest techniques either. In that case, he would settle for the next best thing and use some ordinary culinary skills to advance to the finals. Thinking this, Nian Bing turned around and walked to the center of the circular stage to select the ingredients he needed.\n\nAt this moment, the other chefs had already begun various preparations before cooking. Since the Huálóng Culinary Competition only allowed the chefs themselves to participate without any auxiliary personnel, everything during cooking had to be done by the chef alone. For chefs who usually only handled the final cooking steps, the half-a-shichen (one hour) time limit seemed much tighter. In previous rounds, some chefs had failed to finish because their dishes were too complicated. Therefore, the chefs participating in the later semifinal rounds all tried to save as much time as possible to complete the competition more quickly.\n\nNian Bing didn't wait for the circular stage to turn to another side. After preparing his ingredients, he immediately began. Holding the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God in each hand, he looked up at Xiao Tian once more before beginning his actions. The Morning Dew Blade and the Righteous Sun Blade each emitted faint red and blue light, respectively. Amidst the shimmering lights, just like when Xiao Tian performed Thousand-Cut Hands yesterday, various ingredients on the cutting board seemed to leap. Nian Bing's hands each created a blur, and amidst the flashing lights, he wielded countless rays of light.\n\nBelow the stage, Xiao Tian's eyes lit up. \"Lotus Root Separates but Fibers Remain Knife Technique.\"[^3] This Lotus Root Separates but Fibers Remain Knife Technique was often used by Nian Bing when making the Nine Green Divine Dragon Ice Cloud Concealment. Although it wasn't one of the Five Great Divine Blades and most ordinary chefs knew how to use some variation of it, truly mastering it to a state of perfection was extremely difficult. Its greatest characteristic was to make cuts from both sides, allowing the ingredients to fully extend and take shape. The phrase \"lotus root separates but fibers remain\" naturally means the connection point should be as subtle as possible, yet the ingredient must not break and must retain its overall integrity. This depended entirely on the chef's knife skills.\n\nUnder Galarmandis's rigorous training, Nian Bing's physical strength was far beyond what it once was. He had even mastered the Dragon Dance, hailed as the top knife technique in the culinary world, let alone the Lotus Root Separates but Fibers Remain Knife Technique, which wasn't even listed among the Five Great Divine Blades. With his current level of mental energy, he could discern all sorts of complex conditions within ingredients even without observing them as carefully as Xiao Tian. Guided by his perception of the various textures within the ingredients, he didn't need to consciously pay attention to his technique at all. Subconsciously, he used his mental energy to guide his wrists and fingers, and the two peerless divine blades already produced the desired effect. At this moment, even a slight superfluous tremor could lead to extreme changes. However, Nian Bing's grip on the knives was so stable. From the outside, his knife work seemed far less flashy than Xiao Tian's Thousand-Cut Hands yesterday. Yet, in the eyes of culinary experts, one could faintly perceive a \"field\" forming under Nian Bing's twin blades—a field composed of knife edges. Within this field, all ingredients transformed according to his own will.\n\nThe knife light receded. Nian Bing smoothly waved his hand, and amidst the shimmering light, the few ingredients floated down to lie flat on the steamer. He simply took a few seasonings, sprinkled them evenly over his prepared ingredients, put on the lid, and began steaming them directly over the fire. His movements were extremely fast; the spectators below couldn't possibly see clearly, but Xiao Tian saw it, and so did Spirit Chef Na Yan and Mo Mo on the podium.\n\nThe ingredients Nian Bing prepared were very simple: four green peppers and five different kinds of meat. The common folk didn't notice, but it was impossible for culinary experts like them not to. When the four green peppers were placed in the steamer, the five kinds of meat that had been swept into the air along with the green peppers simultaneously vanished. Although each piece of meat wasn't much, what did this sudden disappearance signify? The seasonings Nian Bing used were very simple, merely common chef's ingredients like salt, cooking wine, and the like. However, in the instant Nian Bing added the seasonings, no one clearly saw what he did.\n\nNian Bing put his twin blades back into his bosom. He glanced at the cutting board; only some green pepper seeds remained on it, which had floated down when he performed his knife technique earlier. A knowing smile appeared on his face, and he murmured to himself, \"It's been a long time since I performed like this. It seems my knife techniques and perception haven't regressed, and my speed is much faster than before. Master, did you see that?\"\n\nNian Bing paid no attention to the steamer, leisurely watching the other chefs' cooking processes. By the time other chefs began their various complicated preparations, he had already opened his steamer. A faint aroma drifted out. Nian Bing once again took out the Righteous Sun Blade. The blade light flashed four times consecutively, and the four green peppers appeared steadily on the not-so-large plate. Without any excessive decoration, he directly signaled to the MC that his cooking was complete. Although his cooking process wasn't the fastest, it had only taken him half the allotted time.\n\nThe MC approached Nian Bing with some surprise. Having witnessed Xiao Tian and Mo Mo's culinary skills, he no longer dared to underestimate any young chef. However, when he saw the plate with four green peppers on the cooking counter in front of Nian Bing, he almost burst out laughing. He looked at Nian Bing doubtfully and asked, \"Are you really planning to use these four steamed green peppers as your semifinal entry?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Are you perhaps doubting how I advanced from the preliminary round to the semifinals?\"\n\nThe MC's face flushed. \"No, any chef who can enter the semifinals naturally possesses a certain level of ability. Our Huálóng Culinary Competition has always been renowned for its fairness and impartiality.\"\n***\n[^1]: `以小人之心度君子之腹 (yǐ xiǎo rén zhī xīn dù jūn zǐ zhī fù)`: A Chinese idiom meaning to judge a noble person's intentions with one's own petty or narrow-minded thoughts; to impute mean motives to an honorable person.\n[^2]: `半個時辰 (bàn gè shí chén)`: A *shichen* is a traditional Chinese unit of time equal to two hours.

    "content": "Nian Bing said calmly, \"I did not go through the preliminary round; I was specially permitted to enter the semi-finals.\" The moment he spoke, it immediately caused an uproar among the crowd below, and countless questioning gazes shot towards the main platform.\n\nThe master of ceremonies' face changed dramatically. He naturally knew how bad an impact Nian Bing's words would bring. He looked up at Hua Fatty, whose face had also changed dramatically on the main platform. Just as he didn't know how to respond, Nian Bing spoke again. This time, he faced the hundreds of thousands of people below the circular platform: \"Everyone, there's no need to question the fairness of the competition. Do you want to know why I didn't participate in the preliminary round? Because, for me, it has no meaning whatsoever. My only goal in participating in this competition is to win the championship. You can just watch. It won't be long; tomorrow, everything will be revealed.\" After saying this, he glanced at Xiao Tian, whose expression on the stage below was not good, then lifted his head and proudly walked off the stage. The crowd below was silent for a moment, then, they burst into laughter, pointing at Nian Bing's dish of four green peppers. Clearly, they thought Nian Bing was boasting. After all, from the start of the semi-finals until now, no chef's entry had looked so unappetizing.\n\nWalking off the circular platform, Nian Bing put on his bamboo hat and quickly blended into the crowd. After all, there were too many people. At first, some still noticed him, but soon, he was swallowed by the surging human tide.\n\nNian Bing lowered his head, constantly pondering what was wrong with him today. He had never been accustomed to being high-profile, yet why did he say such things today?\n\nThe last group of semi-finalists quickly finished. Because Nian Bing was the first to complete his dish, his four green peppers were naturally the first to be presented to the judging panel. The judges on the panel looked at the four dark green peppers, and only two did not show disdain: one was the Dragon Summoner Xi Lad, specially invited to judge this competition. The other was the Spirit Chef God, Na Yan. Xi Lad could remain calm because he had witnessed Nian Bing's culinary skills, while Na Yan was the only one on the judging panel who could barely make out what Nian Bing had done.\n\nHua Fatty glanced at Demon Commander Hū Guāng beside him and whispered, \"I think there's no need to taste this dish, is there? Such an unappetizing dish, just from its color, intent, and form, is not enough to qualify for the finals. Did that chef just now really say he didn't go through the preliminary round? Elder Ling, you are the head of the preliminary round, this...\"\n\nNa Yan smiled calmly and said, \"That's right, I allowed this person not to participate in the preliminary round. Just as he said, the preliminary round serves no purpose for him. Perhaps, only I here will believe that he will ultimately become the champion of this Hua Long Culinary Competition.\"\n\n\"Who said that? I also believe Brother Nian Bing can win the championship of this competition,\" Cat Cat, sitting next to Xi Lad, immediately interjected upon hearing Na Yan's words.\n\nDemon Commander Hū Guāng looked at Xi Lad with some surprise and said, \"Did you bring that person? Old Xi.\"\n\nXi Lad shook his head and said, \"No, my daughter and I have only met him a few times. His culinary skills are indeed excellent. I think these four green peppers are probably not as simple as they appear on the surface.\"\n\nNa Yan smiled, his gaze sweeping over Hua Fatty. \"Fatty, oh Fatty, it's a shame you've immersed yourself in culinary arts for so many years, yet you can't even see this. Culinary works are generally judged by five aspects: color, aroma, taste, intent, and form. You said his dish lacked advantages in color, intent, and form, but that's because you simply don't know what he did with this dish.\"\n\nHua Fatty was stunned for a moment, carefully looking at the green peppers in front of him. He hadn't paid attention to Nian Bing's cooking earlier and truly didn't know what Nian Bing had done to these four green peppers. He looked at Na Yan doubtfully and said, \"Elder Ling, you know, although I like cooking, my talent in this area isn't great. Don't keep me in suspense. What's so special about these four green peppers? Could they possibly be better than Miss Mo Mo's skill?\"\n\nNa Yan chuckled, \"Heh heh, then are you willing to bet with me? I'll bet that young man Nian Bing will ultimately win the championship. If you lose, you'll give me two jars of your treasured century-old liquor to drink. If he doesn't win the championship, I won't ask for your payment anymore. How about that? Fair enough, right?\"\n\nHua Fatty looked at Na Yan in surprise. One must know that Na Yan's salary was sky-high. Although two jars of century-old liquor were valuable, they were far less compared to his salary. However, as a businessman, he would never fight a battle he wasn't sure of. He chuckled, \"Heh heh, there's no need for a bet. If you want to drink, I'll just bring out two jars. Please tell me quickly, what's the mystery of these green peppers?\"\n\nNa Yan turned and nodded expressively to Mo Mo. Mo Mo took out a pair of very thin silver chopsticks from her bosom and handed them to him. Na Yan scanned the other judges and smiled, \"Watch carefully.\" As he spoke, he extended the silver chopsticks towards a green pepper. Unexpectedly, the chopsticks met no resistance from the green pepper and went straight in. He gently picked it up, slowly lifting the chopsticks. At this moment, everyone saw a peculiar sight: under Na Yan's chopsticks, a coil of fine threads lifted from the green pepper. It wasn't a single thread but was composed of six kinds of fine threads arranged together. Although the distinction between the other five threads and the green pepper thread wasn't obvious, from the surface, one could still discern that the six threads were uniformly arranged. Na Yan stood up, lifting the chopsticks higher. The fine threads showed no sign of breaking, and the entire green pepper became smaller in coils, while the threads grew longer and longer.\n\nExcept for Na Yan, everyone's faces showed expressions of astonishment. They found it hard to believe this was real; within a seemingly unremarkable green pepper, such profound mystery was hidden.\n\nNa Yan said calmly, \"Do you still think this dish lacks characteristics in color, intent, and form? This dish is known among our older generation of chefs as the Six-Thread Coiling Pepper. However, those who have truly seen this Six-Thread Coiling Pepper are pitifully few. Generally speaking, this dish is not meant to be eaten, but rather to train knife skills. You should all know the Lotus Root Unbroken Thread Knife Technique*. This Six-Thread Coiling Pepper is precisely the ultimate manifestation of the Lotus Root Unbroken Thread Knife Technique. I can do it myself, but perhaps not with the same ease as that young man. Although this green pepper still looks like a whole, it is actually composed of extremely fine green pepper threads, and the five other kinds of threads inside are lamb, pork, beef, horse, and donkey meat, respectively. These five meat threads and the green pepper threads, through the meat's own stickiness, are formed and adhered together. When eaten, there is no scattering at all, and its own flavor, because the five meat threads and the green pepper threads perfectly fuse during steaming, can display a unique taste. Even if this dish lacks color, intent, and form, judging solely by its taste, it's already enough to compensate. From that young man's calm and swift movements, the mastery he displayed in knife skills is absolutely the most exquisite in this culinary competition. Now, you should understand why I allowed him to have a bye in the preliminary round. For a chef like this, he is fully capable of directly participating in the finals. Alright, have a taste.\" Watching the surprise in the judges' eyes, Na Yan thought to himself. Old friend, old friend, I never expected you to teach such an outstanding disciple. I truly envy you. I hope the Ghost Chef's techniques can reappear in the human world.\n\nHua Fatty felt lucky in his heart, lucky that he hadn't bet with Na Yan, as he looked at the miraculously skillful Six-Thread Coiling Pepper in front of him. He truly found it hard to believe that this was made solely with knife skills.\n\nNone of the judges said anything more. They all moved their chopsticks, each picking up some Six-Thread Coiling Pepper and putting it into their mouths. Exclamations of wonder rang out one after another. Just as Na Yan had said, even if this dish relied solely on its taste, it would be enough to enter the finals. Among everyone, the most surprised was Na Yan himself. As one of the former luminaries of the culinary world, the Six-Thread Coiling Pepper made by Nian Bing brought him immense shock. Compared to previous Six-Thread Coiling Peppers, Nian Bing's dish had several times more variations in flavor. However, Na Yan couldn't fully discern where these additional variations came from. A Spirit Chef was a Spirit Chef after all. After a brief thought, he immediately recalled the two blades in Nian Bing's hands. He naturally recognized the Righteous Sun Blade, and while the Morning Dew Blade wasn't conspicuous on the surface, its archaic design also left a deep impression on him. Na Yan immediately realized that the additional variations in the Six-Thread Coiling Pepper must be related to those two blades.\n\nSoon, the results of the semi-finals were announced. Xiao Tian, Mo Mo, and Nian Bing were selected. To alleviate the public's doubts, Hua Fatty instructed the master of ceremonies to display a complete Six-Thread Coiling Pepper in front of everyone, which finally made the public accept the fact that Nian Bing had entered the finals.\n\nXiao Tian had been watching from below the stage. Having practiced culinary arts for many years, he naturally knew about the famous Six-Thread Coiling Pepper dish. Listening to the master of ceremonies' explanation, his eyes shone brightly, and his fighting spirit rose to an unprecedented level. \"Nian Bing, it seems I still underestimated you. However, the champion of this competition can only be me. Even if I use all my abilities, I will never lose to you.\"\n\nNian Bing walked out of the crowd and headed towards the inn. If Spirit Chef Na Yan hadn't been there today, he definitely wouldn't have chosen the Six-Thread Coiling Pepper. After all, without rich experience, it would indeed be difficult for an ordinary chef to discern its mystery. His mood had calmed down a lot by now. He didn't wander around Talu City but went straight back to the inn. After eating something, he entered meditation again.\n\n...\n\nA certain high mountain in Langmu Empire. Clouds and mist drifted vaguely, and gusts of strong wind blew, carrying flakes of snow. Due to the high altitude, this place was already a world of white. Even those with extremely formidable martial arts would find it difficult to ascend this mountain range. Only some extremely cold-resistant plants could grow here, bringing a touch of vitality to the snowy peaks.\n\nSuddenly, the originally clear sky abruptly darkened. A distant dragon roar echoed, and a colossal white giant dragon emerged from the clouds and mist, circling in the air, bringing forth an intense white light. The light completely enveloped its massive dragon body. Suddenly, the light vanished abruptly, and on the highest snowy peak, an handsome man, completely enveloped in white robes, appeared.\n\nHe looked at the clothes on his body with satisfaction, murmuring to himself in intoxication, \"Human bodies look more and more comfortable the more I look at them. They are much more flexible than dragon bodies. Truly excellent.\"\n\n\"Kai Ao Di Li Si, you're indulging in self-admiration again.\" A booming voice shook the snowy peak, making it tremble as if an avalanche could occur at any moment. A ball of green light, like a meteor, fell onto the peak. Beside the white-robed Kai Ao Di Li Si, a young man clad in green robes suddenly appeared. He appeared even more handsome than Kai Ao Di Li Si, and faint spiritual energy emanated from his entire body.\n\n\"Kai Luo Di Li Si, is that how you talk to your elder brother? You've been hanging out with those white-clad summoners lately, and you've become increasingly garrulous.\" The green-robed man was none other than the Wind-element Giant Dragon, Kai Luo Di Li Si.\n\nKai Luo Di Li Si smiled calmly and said, \"Brother, it seems we haven't seen each other for a few hundred years, have we? So you still remember I'm your younger brother, but who was it who stole my superb silver crystal back then?\"\n\nKai Ao Di Li Si's eyes showed a hint of awkwardness. \"This, this, you can't blame me. You're the Wind-element Giant Dragon King; what would you want with a superb space-element gem? That thing is only of some use to me. You know, we dragons love gems of our own element the most, especially superb ones.\"\n\nKai Luo Di Li Si unhappily reached out his hand and said, \"Now you can return it to me. No matter what, I found that thing. Or, you can exchange it for something of equal value with me.\"\n\nKai Ao Di Li Si's eyes flashed with a hint of anger. \"Don't even mention it! I did want to return it to you, but that silver crystal was stolen less than a year after I got it. Damn it, it depresses me just thinking about it.\"\n\nKai Luo Di Li Si said with some disdain, \"After not seeing each other for a few hundred years, you've even learned human curses. But your lie is too fake, isn't it? Who could steal a gem from you, the Space Dragon King?\"\n\nKai Ao Di Li Si pointed his right middle finger upwards, indicating the sky, and said, \"Although I took your silver crystal, I, Kai Ao Di Li Si, wouldn't stoop to lying. Damn it, it's that bastard Jia La Man Di Si! Besides him, who would be so bold as to steal from my place? You also know that Jia La Man Di Si's strength among us Seven Dragon Kings is the most despicable, impossible to guard against! Humph, he'll probably arrive soon. When he does, we brothers will go after him together. He won't dare not comply. I'll get the silver crystal back for you, but I want to vent my anger on that bastard Jia La Man Di Si.\"\n\n---\n*   *Lotus Root Unbroken Thread Knife Technique*: Lit. \"Lotus Root Unbroken Thread Knife Technique,\" referring to a knife skill where an ingredient is cut into extremely thin, continuous threads, mimicking the way lotus root breaks but leaves fine, connected fibers.",

    "content": "Carlo de Rys looked at Kao de Rys's gesture, frowning deeply. He took a step back and said, \"Can you be a bit more civilized? You're truly disgracing us dragons.\"\n\nJust then, a teasing voice suddenly rang out, \"Carlo! Your brother has always been like this. Having a brother like him, I truly feel sorry for you.\" Red light shimmered, and a figure appeared in mid-air, slowly floating towards the snow peak. It was Galamandis, the Fire Dragon King whom Kao de Rys hated to his very bones.\n\n\"Galamandis, you bastard, I'll fight you to the death!\" A flash of silver light, and Kao de Rys's body abruptly vanished. When he reappeared, he was already in front of Galamandis, suddenly punching him in the chest. The instant Kao de Rys's human fist struck, a silver hexagram instantly burst forth with dazzling light, and silver rays enveloped Galamandis from all directions.\n\nGalamandis chuckled. In an instant, his entire body emanated a layer of fiery red aura. The red light immediately enveloped an area of a thousand *tai*^1, and the massive silver hexagram vanished instantly. The extreme heat brought by the red light immediately melted the once towering snow peak into water, causing the entire snow peak's height to drop sharply.\n\nCarlo de Rys, the Wind Dragon King, cursed angrily. He quickly rose with the wind, circling in mid-air, thus avoiding the collateral damage.\n\nGalamandis remained floating there, while Kao de Rys was slightly panting a hundred meters away, his expression also showing a few changes. Galamandis chuckled, saying, \"Kao, I admit that in terms of escape techniques, I definitely can't compare to you. However, when it comes to combat power, you're far behind. To fight me, you'll need to go back and train for a few more millennia. Your sealing techniques are useless against me.\"\n\nKao de Rys, the Space Dragon King, roared, \"Damn it. Galamandis, you freak, have you been holed up all these years just training every day?\"\n\nGalamandis said proudly, \"For someone as great as me, even if I don't train for a single day, it's still easy to beat you, Kao. I advise you to save your strength. Perhaps I'll treat you better when I inherit the Dragon God's position. Hahahaha.\" His smug, cocky appearance greatly displeased Kao de Rys, but he also knew he was no match, so he could only retort with an angry glare, \"Pah, pah, pah! You think you can inherit the Dragon God's position? Only I have that possibility. Don't think that just because your attack power is strong it's enough. To become the Dragon God's successor, wisdom is even more important. In that regard, you've always been the worst.\" Kao de Rys looked at Galamandis with disdain but did not attack again.\n\nCarlo de Rys floated to the same height, looking at Galamandis and asking, \"Old Ga, my brother says you took the Silver Crystal. Is that true?\"\n\nGalamandis said naturally, \"Yes! I did take it. That day, I accidentally saw your brother smugly flying off somewhere, not knowing where he was going. I quietly followed him and heard him say something like, 'That idiot Carlo actually found such a superb Silver Crystal. This time, I got a bargain, hehe. With this Silver Crystal, my magic power will definitely improve a lot, and in the future, I, alone, will be supreme among the Seven Dragon Kings.' He mimicked him very well, completely imitating Kao de Rys. Upon hearing this, Kao de Rys roared and charged at Galamandis again.\n\nThe red flames instantly turned purple. Galamandis's dragon might surged dramatically, forcing Kao de Rys back from below. Although Kao de Rys, as the Space Dragon King, had a profound understanding of space, he was indeed far inferior to Galamandis in terms of magic power. At their level, while technique was still important, absolute power was the foundation. Galamandis simply gave Kao de Rys no opportunity to employ his techniques. Relying solely on pure energy attacks, Kao de Rys naturally had no way to deal with him.\n\n\"Hehe, Carlo, you see? I wasn't lying. What I hate most is your brother's smug look, so I stole the Silver Crystal. Back then, he chased me for tens of thousands of miles, trying to get it back. Unfortunately, while I'm not as good as him in technique, his power wasn't enough to easily harm me. In the end, he had no choice but to give up dejectedly.\"\n\nCarlo de Rys glared at his brother, slightly annoyed, \"I called you 'brother,' but you're becoming more and more obscene, just like Mao Mao's summoned fox-like beast. Galamandis, I don't care what happened back then, just give me back that Silver Crystal. As for what happens between you and my brother, I'm too lazy to care. Fight however you want to.\"\n\nGalamandis spread his hands and said, \"Carlo, it's not that I don't want to give it to you. It's just that I later used your Silver Crystal to make a knife, and then gave it to a human. Even if I wanted to return it to you now, I couldn't.\"\n\nCarlo de Rys said, slightly angered, \"Galamandis, are you trying to covet my treasure? Others might not know where your dragon lair is, but I know it very well. Be careful, or I'll go dig up your precious collection.\"\n\nGalamandis said, his expression unchanged, \"I'm telling the truth. You know, although I have a few minor flaws, the greatest virtue of I, the great Fire Dragon King Galamandis, is that I never lie. Besides, I have no reason to deceive you. That Silver Crystal is useless to me. It really has been given away. If you truly want it, just go find that human yourself and ask for it.\"\n\nKao de Rys's eyes darted, and he said, \"Little brother, I'm not one to stir up trouble, but if someone took my things, I wouldn't be able to tolerate it.\"\n\nGalamandis made a dismissive gesture towards Kao de Rys, \"You're not one to stir up trouble?! Then I'm a true gentleman!^2 Kao, if you're not convinced, let's have a fight.\"\n\n\"Oh, you're all here. It seems the two of us truly arrived a bit late.\" Two masses of light, one gold and one black, swiftly approached from afar. In a blink, they were before the three Dragon Kings. With a flash of light, two dragon-like figures quickly shrunk, and a man and a woman stopped beside the trio. Their position perfectly separated Galamandis and Kao de Rys.\n\nThe woman in golden robes was very tall. Her slender yet voluptuous figure could absolutely be considered that of a peerless human beauty. Her long golden hair cascaded down her back, and her entire being exuded a sacred aura. Bathed in a faint golden glow, she was as captivating as a goddess descended from heaven. Her right thumb and forefinger continuously flicked in front of her, sending out dazzling golden flowers.\n\nThe man in black robes appeared extremely cold on the surface. Standing beside the woman in golden robes, he remained silent. His somewhat pale complexion looked very stern. But regardless of whether it was the two brothers Carlo and Kao, or the always arrogant Galamandis, their gazes all remained fixed on his handsome yet pale face. The earlier quarrel immediately ceased.\n\nThe golden-robed beauty smiled sweetly and said, \"Why are you all silent? Wasn't it very lively just now? Continue. Go on!\"\n\nKao de Rys chuckled, saying, \"Dimantti, don't tease us. You know we were just fooling around. I didn't expect you two to arrive so quickly. Boss Kajetossis, you look well!\"\n\nKajetossis, clad in black, flashed a cold light in his eyes and uttered two short words: \"Nonsense.\"\n\nKao de Rys showed strong apprehension towards Kajetossis. He gave a few dry chuckles and said no more. Galamandis, however, seemed very composed. He smiled faintly and said, \"Kajetossis, both you and your spouse have come. How could Bingbing and the Dark Dragon King be a couple?^3 This is almost unimaginable.\"\n\nDimantti smiled faintly, \"Galamandis, looking at you, it seems your strength has improved quite a bit over the years! Kajetossis hasn't been in a good mood lately. If your hands are itching for a fight, you can spar with him. I absolutely won't interfere.\"\n\nGalamandis snorted, \"Stop with the sarcasm. Who doesn't know that you, Miss, are always subtly protective? Kajetossis is your husband. Let alone me not being able to beat him, even if I did, would you let it go? Sometimes I truly don't understand which of you two is light and which is darkness.\"\n\nKao de Rys, standing aside, chuckled, \"Dimantti, I'm not one to stir up trouble, but if I were you, I wouldn't be able to tolerate it.\"\n\n\"Shut up.\" Kajetossis impatiently snapped. Kao de Rys's body trembled, and he immediately closed his mouth with an apologetic smile.\n\nDimantti giggled, \"Galamandis, your guts seem to have shrunk quite a bit compared to before! Didn't you always want to challenge Kajetossis? Why are you backing down now? Don't worry. Even if I wanted to help him now, I couldn't. Our baby is due soon, and I don't want to affect the pregnancy.\" As she spoke, she looked at her flat lower abdomen, her pretty face slightly flushed. Her current appearance was purely an illusion, not her true form, so the signs of pregnancy weren't visible.\n\nKajetossis, with his perpetually cold and proud expression, rarely showed a hint of tenderness. He looked up at Galamandis and said, \"Interested?\"\n\nA trace of gloom appeared in Galamandis's eyes. He shook his head and said, \"Not interested. Congratulations to you two. We're gathered here this time not for fighting. Let's discuss serious matters when Bingbing and Fatty Shi arrive.\"\n\nDimantti looked deeply at Galamandis and smiled faintly, \"They won't be coming. I received their message. Bingbing is currently undergoing her final metamorphosis and will soon fully transform into her Dragon King form. Fatty Shi said he's going into secluded cultivation, so he won't be coming either.\"\n\n\"Secluded cultivation? That dead fatty is going into secluded cultivation? His dragon belly is so fat he can barely fly. I bet he's definitely gone to the seaside to feast again. Dimantti, we should think of a way to help him lose weight.\" Kao de Rys said in a strange, mocking tone.\n\nGalamandis nodded and said, \"Kao's pretty much right. Among the seven of us, Fatty Shi is probably even more fond of eating than I am. That fellow has no taste at all when it comes to food; he just knows how to win by quantity.\"\n\nDimantti looked at Galamandis with some surprise and said, \"So, you're saying you have great taste in food now? I remember back when you and Fatty Shi ate together, you didn't look much better than him.\"\n\nGalamandis snorted, \"It's different now. I've specially hired the best chef. Eating is an art. The finest delicacy, even just a bite, is far better than hundreds of catties of ordinary food. Gourmet food needs to be savored.\"\n\nKajetossis, the Dark Dragon King, looked at Galamandis with some surprise and uttered three words: \"Makes sense.\"\n\nDimantti looked at Galamandis in surprise, \"A dedicated chef? Galamandis, you haven't forgotten the Dragon God's instructions, have you? We're not allowed to disturb humans.\"\n\nGalamandis snorted, \"That human willingly cooks for me. Besides, I've paid him.\"\n\nCarlo de Rys, the Wind Dragon King, who had been silent, said discontentedly, \"It wouldn't happen to be my Silver Crystal, would it?\"\n\nGalamandis chuckled, \"That thing was useless to me, so I gave it to him. If you want it, go get it yourself.\"\n\n\"You...\"\n\nA cold light burst forth in Kajetossis, the Dark Dragon King's eyes. He said coldly, \"Speak of serious matters.\"\n\nDimantti said, \"Right, let's talk about serious matters. You can sort out your personal affairs yourselves later.\"\n\nHearing the words of the strongest twin-dragon combination among the Seven Dragon Kings, the expressions of Galamandis and the other three dragons became serious. Kao de Rys, the Space Dragon King, was the first to lower his head and said, \"My Seal Bottle of Morda is lost.\"\n\nKajetossis, the Dark Dragon King, calmly said, \"Explain.\"\n\nKao de Rys, the Space Dragon King, glanced at the other four Dragon Kings and stammered, \"I, I saw a beautiful girl last time. She also seemed to like me, and then we lived a happy life together. But not long after, I found that she suddenly disappeared, and the Seal Bottle of Morda that I was keeping, it, it was also gone. You can't really blame me for this; how was I supposed to know she was a spy?\"\n\nDimantti frowned deeply, \"You good-for-nothing, you still can't change your lecherous ways.\" Although Kao de Rys made it sound simple, all the other four Dragon Kings knew that the matter was far from that simple. Galamandis couldn't help but say, \"It's probably not that she stole it. With your lustful heart, it's possible you even gave it to her.\"\n\nKao de Rys, the Space Dragon King, chuckled, \"Well, she said the bottle was very pretty and distinctive, so I...\"\n\n\"You should die.\" Black light suddenly flared. Even Kao de Rys, who was most adept at dodging, had no chance to escape. A startling explosion rang out in the air. His human body was instantly forced back into its true form and abruptly sent flying far away, letting out a miserable dragon roar.\n\nKajetossis, the Dark Dragon King, looked at Kao de Rys, the Space Dragon King, and smiled, \"My hands have really been itching lately, Kao. After things here are settled, please be my guest at Dimantti's and my home for a while.\"\n\nKao de Rys, who had just flown back, cried out miserably, \"Boss Siss, no! I know I was wrong!\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n^1: *Tai*: A unit of measurement, specific value not given in the text.\n^2: The original Chinese text uses asterisks (***) to imply a strong curse word or an extremely disdainful rhetorical question.\n^3: In the context of the story, Kajetossis *is* the Dark Dragon King, and his partner is Dimantti.

    "content": "Galamandis gloated, \"It's too late to know your mistake! Didn't you see Kajeosius smiling? And he said such a long sentence. You're in trouble, fellow, but you've long deserved such a punishment.\"\n\nDimantedi snorted coldly, \"Galamandis, don't be too pleased with yourself. According to the information I've received, the bottle in your hand should be gone too, right? And the chunky guy's as well. How did you three complete Lord Dragon God's mission? Tell us your situation.\"\n\nGalamandis said somewhat awkwardly, \"Well, it's not that I was careless, but the enemy was too cunning. They actually prepared space scrolls of Tier 10 or higher. They seized the bottle and ran the moment I was distracted. I couldn't catch them in time. A few days ago, I suddenly sensed the aura of the bottle, but when I chased it, the aura disappeared again, and then I received your message and rushed over.\"\n\nDark Dragon King Kajeosius smiled again, \"Excellent! You're really getting more and more capable. In your eyes, losing one of the seven bottles isn't a big problem, is it? You come over to our side too.\"\n\nThis time, it was Kaodris's turn to gloat, \"Gala, Kajeosius's sentence seems even longer this time. You're doomed, hehe. If we brothers work together, we might not suffer any losses, right?\"\n\nGalamandis said proudly, \"Who's brothers with you? Being a guest is being a guest. However, I'm ready. Kajeosius, I will absolutely not team up with that sordid fellow Kaodris. If your hands are itching for a fight, let's just go one-on-one.\"\n\nDark Dragon King Kajeosius nodded coldly, \"You have backbone. You're stronger than him.\"\n\nDimantedi's gaze turned to Wind Dragon King Karodris and she asked, \"Karo, where's your bottle?\"\n\nKarodris said, \"I wasn't as careless as them. The bottle has been sealed by my dragon power in a secret place in a human village. It's guarded by four powerful human summoners. With their mental magic strength, it's impossible for the enemy to steal it. If it's a direct confrontation, the summoning techniques of those four humans are not something anyone can contend with. Furthermore, my human friend, with whom I have a contract, recently subdued a Golden-Backed Earth Dragon King that has already begun to evolve into a true dragon. With its assistance in guarding, there won't be any problems.\"\n\nDimantedi nodded and said, \"You've always been cautious, and we trust you on that. After you return, it would be best for you to guard it yourself. From the current situation, it's clear that the enemy, who obtained three Sealing Bottles of Anoda, is organized and premeditated. The remaining four bottles in our possession are undoubtedly their target. We must not only guard these four bottles but also try our best to retrieve the other three, otherwise, if Lord Dragon God blames us, none of us can bear the responsibility.\"\n\nWind Dragon King Karodris said, \"Diman, the enemy is hidden in the dark. Since they dared to steal the bottles, they naturally have the ability to conceal the bottles' aura. Could it be that they really want to open the Gate of Space and let those abandoned races return?\"\n\nDimantedi nodded and said, \"Besides this purpose, I really can't think of any other reason. Most of the gods are currently in slumber. Once those abandoned races return to Yangguang Continent, it will inevitably bring about a bloody storm. Even if the gods can awaken on time, they might not be able to avoid a catastrophe. So many years have passed; who knows how powerful those abandoned races have become? After all, during the War of the Gods back then, they were only narrowly defeated and severely wounded the gods. If the gods had the power to destroy them, they would have done so long ago.\"\n\nSpace Dragon King Kaodris grumbled, \"Gods, abandoned races, aren't they all just human farces? I really don't understand, if these seven bottle-auras are so important, why don't the gods guard them themselves instead of letting us guard them?\"\n\nDimantedi snorted coldly, \"There are many things you don't understand. If the gods could guard the seven bottles themselves, they would have done so long ago. These seven bottles have a great influence on our dragon race as well; you should understand this point.\"\n\nKaodris said, \"Isn't it Kajeosius, those clansmen of yours...\" At this point, suddenly feeling Kajeosius's sharp gaze, he couldn't bring himself to say the rest of the sentence.\n\nCold light flashed repeatedly in Dimantedi's eyes. \"I hope you understand that Kajeosius is one of us. Although he was once a prince of the Dark Dragon race, he now has no connection whatsoever with the Dark Dragon race. If anyone brings up his painful past again, don't blame me for turning hostile.\"\n\nKaodris said awkwardly, \"Me, I spoke too quickly, I'm sorry. But Diman, when will you change your temper? You're about to become a mother. If you pass on this temper to your child, it won't be a good thing.\"\n\nDimantedi grumbled, \"None of your business! My child will definitely be the most outstanding.\"\n\nGalamandis gazed deeply at Dimantedi and said, \"I also want to see what attribute the child born to the Dark Dragon King and Light Dragon King will have. Since the enemy's existence is confirmed, we must also begin our actions. We still have four bottles in our hands. The first thing to do is to protect these four bottles well. Only then should we try to retrieve the other bottles. Diman, you're about to give birth; your strength will be greatly weakened then, and Kajeosius, in order to take care of you, probably won't be able to tend to too many things. Your child will also need some time to hatch. Therefore, I want to go find the chunky guy. That fellow has always been too lazy; let him go search for the stolen bottles. After I find him, I'll immediately come to you and guard you during your delivery.\"\n\nA hint of tenderness flashed in Dark Dragon King Kajeosius's eyes. \"Thank you.\"\n\nGalamandis said coldly, \"No need to thank me. You should know that I'm not doing this for you, but for Diman. I don't want anything to happen to her. After all, she's the only one I've loved in this life. Although she chose you, she will always be important in my heart. Kajeosius, do you know? I've wished more than once that you would treat her badly, so I'd have a reason to take her back.\"\n\nKajeosius looked calmly at Galamandis, and said in an unusually firm tone, \"Unless I die, no one can harm or take my beloved. Although you are my rival in love, I have never considered you an enemy. Do you know why?\"\n\nGalamandis gave him a cold glance. \"Your words seem particularly numerous today. I don't know, and I don't want to know. I'm going to find the chunky guy now. Before I return, protect Dimantedi well, and you, Kaodris, remember to set up more barriers around the place where Diman gives birth.\" As soon as his voice fell, his human form suddenly expanded, transforming back into his fire dragon appearance. His huge dragon wings scattered the surrounding white clouds as he vanished in the blink of an eye, like an arrow loosed from a bowstring.\n\nKaodris watched Galamandis's enormous figure gradually disappear and asked curiously, \"Kajeosius, why don't you consider him an enemy? I'm not one to stir up trouble, but back then, when he was pursuing Diman, he was like a fly drawn to dung.\"\n\nKajeosius snorted dismissively but did not speak. Instead, Dimantedi seemed to be recalling something and said indifferently, \"That's because, in Kajeosius's eyes, Galamandis is a true man. At least, he knows what true love is. To make me happy, he eventually gave up pursuing me. Back then, if it weren't for his help, Lord Dragon God would never have allowed Kajeosius and me to unite. The rest of you don't know about that matter, but Galamandis truly is a good person. If there's a next life, perhaps I'd marry him.\"\n\n\"No! Even if he's a good person, even if there's a next life, you can only be mine.\" Kajeosius's voice was deep and powerful, filled with an overbearing dominance. He wrapped an arm around Dimantedi's waist and gazed deeply into her golden eyes.\n\n\"Alright, you're like a jar of vinegar!^1 I only said 'perhaps'. Alright, Karo, you go back and guard your bottle. Kaodris, you come with us.\" Four figures simultaneously soared into the sky. The golden, black, azure, and silver giant dragons circled once in the air before heading in different directions.\n\nThe towering mountain range returned to calm. Only the snow-capped peak, whose height had been lowered by several hundred meters due to Galamandis, could bear witness to the extraordinary changes that had previously occurred.\n\n...\n\nIn the early morning, Nianbing stood by the window, bathing in the warm sunlight, stretching his body leisurely. The feeling of basking in the morning sun after a night of meditation was his favorite.\n\nToday, the Hualong Culinary Competition was holding its finals. He was about to face Momo and Xiaotian. He had confidence in himself but would never underestimate his opponents. Xiaotian's confidence was certainly not without reason.\n\nHe took a comfortable bath, changed into a brand new coarse cloth garment, and touched the Spatial Ring on his hand. Within his body, the power of ice and fire of the same origin circulated harmoniously, their trajectories so clear. Ice and fire elements in the surrounding air continuously converged towards his body. With every gesture, it was as if magic was taking form. That feeling was so wonderful. Nianbing knew that he had advanced another step on the path of magic, and his continuous arduous cultivation over these days had not been in vain. However, what he hadn't realized was that his current achievements were greatly related to his eight years of cultivation in the Peach Blossom Forest. In those years, Nianbing only felt his magic power gradually improving. In fact, he didn't know that by continuously cultivating daily with the Stone of the Ice Goddess and the Stone of the Flame God, the energy nurtured by the two supreme-grade gems had already been nourishing his body imperceptibly. Eight years of continuous meditation had subtly changed his body a great deal. After Fire Dragon King Galamandis helped him remove impurities from his body, the results of eight years of meditation finally began to manifest. This was the fundamental reason for his magical progress during this recent period, though his magic improvement was also inseparable from his continuous insights.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he used his mental power to conceal the magical fluctuations around his body and simply combed his golden long hair with his ten fingers. Nianbing pushed open the door and stepped out. After last night's meditation, he suddenly understood some things: whether it was magic or culinary skills, there was no longer a need for him to hide them. The High Priestess of the Ice Goddess was renowned as the continent's foremost magician; did anyone dare to provoke her? No, the reason was simple: because she was powerful enough. As long as he displayed his ice and fire of the same origin power to outsiders, then the pressure from now on would become his greatest motivation. Therefore, he had already made two decisions, and today, the first goal he had to achieve was his very first objective.\n\nThere was still an hour left until the finals began. Talu Plaza was already a sea of people. Before the competition, Fatty Hua was leading the staff of his Hualong Restaurant, distributing small pastries made by the restaurant to the spectators. Although the number of pastries was limited and only some people received them, his actions still drew thunderous cheers from the people of Talu City. In an instant, Hualong Restaurant's prestige had reached new heights. Undeniably, Fatty Hua was an extremely excellent businessman. His vision was far-reaching, and he was deeply liked by the people of Talu City; this way, he would get more business.\n\nOn the main stage, Demon Marshal Huguang sat in the center. Dragon Summoner Shirad sat beside him, his eyes flickering, divine light constantly flowing within them, seemingly searching for something in the crowd. Maomao stood behind her father, also looking at the sea of people below. She was full of confidence in Nianbing and was currently fantasizing about tasting the delicious dishes Nianbing would prepare in the finals. The Spirit Chef, Yan, was comfortably dozing off at the very edge of the main stage, while the high officials from Talu City and the gourmets specially invited by Fatty Hua were whispering among themselves, discussing who would win the final championship this time.\n\nTime passed minute by minute. Half an hour remained until the start of the competition. At this moment, Fatty Hua, who was sweating profusely from busyness, had already changed into a new outfit and stepped onto the central circular platform. The staff had also finished arranging all the necessary materials for the competition. The fat on Fatty Hua's face trembled slightly as he held a magical loudspeaker and said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, Fatty is almost dead from exhaustion. Please quiet down for a moment. The finals are about to begin shortly. Although Fatty has lost a few pounds of fat from being tired these past two days, Fatty's mood is always excited! It is Fatty's honor to have so many friends supporting the Hualong Culinary Competition organized by Fatty. Without your support, there would be no Hualong today. Alright, Fatty won't waste any more words. Before the competition begins, let's first invite the ten contestants from the previous day. First, for our first participant, we invite the only female in the finals, Miss Momo.\"\n\n---\n^1: \"Jar of vinegar\" (醋罈子) is a Chinese idiom referring to a person who is easily jealous.",

    "content": "With a shout from Hua Fatty, Mo Mo, still in her white chef's robe, slowly ascended the stage from one side. Her steps were light, and every movement appeared soft. Although she wasn't exactly a beauty, she was, after all, the only female in the finals of this Hua Long Culinary Arts Competition, immediately drawing a round of warm applause from the audience.\n\nHua Fatty smiled faintly, \"Miss Mo Mo possesses exquisite culinary skills and has received unanimous praise from the judges. We hope she can achieve new heights in the competition. Miss Mo Mo, do you have anything you'd like to say to everyone?\"\n\nMo Mo smiled and shook her head. She walked over to a kitchen counter and stood behind it. Hua Fatty smiled, \"Girls, naturally, are a bit shy. Alright, next, we invite our next contestant, Chef Xiao—Tian—.\" With a drawn-out final syllable, Xiao Tian deftly stepped onto the revolving platform. Today, he was unexpectedly dressed in warrior's garb, also white, with broad shoulders and a slender waist. Coupled with his handsome face and a faint trace of arrogance, he immediately drew a burst of cheers from the young women in the audience. Without waiting for Hua Fatty to speak, he took the magical megaphone. \"It is my great honor to enter the finals of this competition, though it is something I had long anticipated. For me, there is only one satisfactory outcome in today's finals, and that is the championship. Second place holds no meaning for me. I will display all of my skills.\"\n\nThe audience's cheers were not as enthusiastic as when Mo Mo had first ascended the stage. After all, arrogant and domineering chefs were not what people liked. Xiao Tian, like Nian Bing yesterday, caused many in the audience to dismiss him with scorn. Hua Fatty, however, was not displeased by Xiao Tian's demeanor. To him, chefs with exquisite culinary skills all possessed their own unique personalities; only such chefs could be truly uncommon.\n\nNext, under Hua Fatty's introduction, seven more chefs appeared one by one, all culinary elites who had emerged from this competition. Judging solely by their demeanor, they were distinctly different from the contestants in the semi-finals. The nine individuals stood upon the revolving platform as if each possessed their own domain, none yielding in terms of aura.\n\nHua Fatty cleared his throat. \"Alright, next, we invite the last contestant to enter the finals, Nian Bing. Yesterday, he brought me immense surprise. His flawless to the extreme Six-Thread Spiraling Pepper left me speechless with admiration. We hope he can bring us more miraculous cooking skills today. We invite Chef Nian Bing!\" As soon as he finished speaking, everyone waited expectantly for Nian Bing's appearance, but there was no new figure at the platform's entrance. A hint of awkwardness appeared on Hua Fatty's face, and he spoke again, \"We invite Chef Nian Bing to the stage.\" Despite the second call, Nian Bing's figure was still absent.\n\nHua Fatty frowned slightly and said loudly, \"Has Chef Nian Bing arrived? If you don't come up to the stage now, it will mean you've forfeited your qualification for these finals.\" Quite a bit of time had been spent introducing the previous nine chefs, and it was almost time for the competition to begin.\n\nJust then, the west side of Taru Plaza suddenly turned ablaze with red. Marshal Gu Guang, who was on the main stage, abruptly stood up. A layer of faint silver light shimmered as his gaze darted towards the direction of the fiery red glow. A dragon's roar resonated at that moment, shaking the entire area and causing all the onlookers to turn their gaze in that direction, immediately inciting a commotion, for no one knew what was happening there. Just then, a mass of red light suddenly ascended into the sky. The red light took shape, revealing itself to be a giant dragon formed of flames. The dragon was over ten meters long. Although formed from fire, its head, body, and claws appeared exceptionally clear. The resonant dragon's roar was indeed coming from its mouth. This sudden, magnificent spectacle immediately stunned the entire audience. Marshal Gu Guang's heart jolted; was someone causing trouble? Judging by the fire dragon's appearance, it should at least be a level eight magic or higher. It was actually an Archmage! With so many people in the plaza, the power of such high-tier magic, if unleashed, would undoubtedly cause countless casualties.\n\nAs the commander of the Northeastern Army Group, Gu Guang dared not show any negligence. If something happened in Taru Plaza, even he wouldn't be able to bear the responsibility. Just as he was preparing to use his battle qi to destroy the fire dragon, Hilard placed a hand on his shoulder. \"Don't rush, that's not an enemy. Nian Bing has arrived. Look, on the dragon's head.\"\n\nListening to Hilard's words, Gu Guang then noticed that a person was standing on the head of the giant, ten zhang long dragon. Dressed in ordinary coarse cloth attire, with golden long hair and a handsome face, it was indeed Nian Bing, who had entered the Hua Long Culinary Arts Competition finals yesterday with his Six-Thread Spiraling Pepper. Seeing this, Gu Guang couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, \"Isn't he a chef? How did he become a magician as well?\"\n\nHilard said calmly, \"When I saw him last time, he was already a Grand Mage. However, even if his magic has improved, it's impossible for him to reach the Archmage realm so quickly. Although this fire dragon appears magnificent, it's merely a bit of cleverness in magical control; its true rank is merely sixth tier. After half a year's absence, this kid certainly has more tricks up his sleeve than before.\"\n\nMao Mao's beautiful large eyes sparkled like stars. \"Wow, Brother Nian Bing is so handsome! This magic is amazing, Papa, when can I use my Little Stutterer? I want a dragon too!\"\n\nHilard smiled faintly and said, \"You rascal, do you understand the consequences of not working hard normally now? If you want to possess your own dragon, you need to achieve stronger power; it's not something you can get just by talking, do you understand? Unless your mental power reaches over sixty percent of mine, I won't let you try to control Little Stutterer. A dignified dragon, yet you gave it such a name, sigh.\"\n\nWhile they were speaking, Nian Bing, escorted by the massive fire dragon, had already arrived above the platform. Nian Bing stood with his hands behind his back on the dragon's back, nodded to Hua Fatty, and said, \"Sorry, there were too many people outside, I had to use this method to enter.\"\n\nHua Fatty was, after all, a man who had seen the world. After a brief moment of surprise, he immediately broke into a smile and said, \"So you're not only a chef, but also a powerful magician! This is the first time I've seen such a strange combination of professions. Since you're here, prepare for the competition.\"\n\nUnder Nian Bing's mental power control, the fire dragon lowered its large head and directly sent him onto the platform. The scorching airflow completely vanished the moment Nian Bing stepped onto the platform. The fire dragon transformed into a shower of sparks and drifted away with the wind. Golden-haired Nian Bing said no more, walking directly to the last kitchen counter.\n\nThe entire final venue became even more enthusiastic due to Nian Bing's appearance. Fire was the most revered magical element in the Hua Rong Empire. The magnificent fire dragon ignited the atmosphere of the entire arena. Various cheers rang out one after another. After all, how many could see, like Hilard, that the fire dragon was outwardly strong but inwardly weak?\n\nDid Nian Bing not have the ability to use a true fire dragon? Of course not. Having reached the Archmage realm, he could already control eighth-tier magic like the fire dragon. However, he only used the fire dragon to send himself onto the stage, not for combat. Being rational, he naturally prioritized conserving his magical power. Since he could achieve the same effect, why expend too much?\n\nXiao Tian and Mo Mo, who were originally the highest calls for championship, were now completely overshadowed in terms of aura by Nian Bing. As luck would have it, Nian Bing's position was exactly between Mo Mo and Xiao Tian. Mo Mo nodded with a friendly smile towards Nian Bing, while Xiao Tian's eyes were filled with challenging flames.\n\nNian Bing looked at Xiao Tian and smiled faintly, \"Do you still think you can defeat me now?\"\n\nXiao Tian said coldly, \"Why not? Although your fire-element magic is very beneficial for your cooking, that doesn't mean your culinary skills are superior to mine. Let our skills prove themselves; anything more said now is meaningless.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"Is that what you think? Very well, I'm also curious to know what exactly you rely on. Let's see who surprises whom more.\"\n\nThe competition had not yet begun, but the revolving platform was already filled with the scent of gunpowder. Hua Fatty chuckled, looking at Nian Bing, then at Xiao Tian. In his heart, both of them were rising stars of the culinary world. For this competition, Mo Mo was the strongest contestant representing the Hua Long Hotel. Hua Fatty had originally hoped Mo Mo would win first place to uphold Hua Long's prestige. However, he now had a better plan; recruiting even one first-class chef with genuine talent and skill, like Nian Bing or Xiao Tian, would be far more valuable than empty fame.\n\nClearing his throat, Hua Fatty spoke loudly through the magical megaphone, \"Alright, time is almost up. I've already announced the rules before. The finals are divided into three stages: the first stage will be held this morning, the second stage this afternoon, and the final stage will take place tonight. If anyone is hungry, our Hua Long Hotel has prepared some simple food and drinks, sold only at cost price. Everyone is welcome to purchase them. I, Hua Fatty, would never make money against my conscience at a time like this!\" As soon as these words were spoken, a burst of cheers immediately erupted from the audience. Even ordinary food produced by Hua Long Hotel was definitely far superior to what was available outside.\n\nNian Bing looked at Hua Fatty, thinking to himself, \"This guy is truly a talent; it would be a waste if he didn't go into diplomacy.\"\n\nWith a faint smile, Hua Fatty said, \"No need to be polite, this is what I should do. The first stage of the competition will have the main ingredient decided by the judges, to be cooked by the ten finalist chefs. Now, I shall announce the main ingredient, which is...\" He paused there for a moment, then continued, \"Watermelon.\"\n\nThe two words, \"watermelon,\" not only shocked the audience below, but also surprised the competing chefs above. No one had expected these judges to come up with such a bizarre main ingredient. Watermelon contained a large amount of water, was the most common fruit platter ingredient, inherently cool and juicy, sweet in taste, and had the effect of relieving summer heat. However, cooking with watermelon seemed to be anything but easy.\n\nWhile the chefs were still pondering, competition staff had already brought up the main ingredients. It was truly a challenge for Hua Fatty; the ten watermelons for the ten chefs were almost identical in size, with no discernible difference. Nian Bing lowered his head to look at his watermelon, then at Hua Fatty. He knew that these watermelons were not only identical in size, but likely also in their ripeness level. Only this way could the fairness of the competition be ensured.\n\nXiao Tian held his watermelon and kept tossing it upwards, his gaze fixed on Nian Bing. He said with a hint of schadenfreude, \"What if you're a magician? I want to see how you apply fire-element magic to a cooling watermelon.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at his own watermelon, stroking its uniform tiger-stripe pattern with his hand, and said calmly, \"With ears deaf to the outside world, and a mind focused solely on the task at hand. You should mind your own business.\"\n\nWith a 'crunch', an impatient chef had already cut his watermelon in half. Nian Bing's gaze swept over it, seeing that the cut watermelon was perfectly ripe, with red flesh and black seeds, giving off a fresh, sweet aroma. It was indeed a good melon. Since the finals were divided into three stages, it was clear that the sum of scores from all three stages would determine the final champion. This was the first round, and he had to gain an early advantage no matter what. Since that was the case, he couldn't hold back his true abilities.\n\nThinking this, Nian Bing carefully placed the watermelon in front of him and slowly closed his eyes. At this moment, everything around him was completely filtered by his mental power; no noisy sounds could affect his current state of mind.\n\nHua Fatty had already returned to the main stage while Nian Bing and Xiao Tian were engaged in verbal sparring. Now, only the emcee and the ten finalist chefs were on the revolving platform for the competition.\n\nSeven of the ten top chefs had already become busy, either slicing the melon, removing seeds, or carving. The revolving platform immediately became a hive of activity. The three who hadn't moved were Nian Bing, Xiao Tian, and Mo Mo. Xiao Tian and Mo Mo were both carefully examining their watermelons. As the main ingredient for the first round, they cleverly chose to observe thoroughly before cooking. Only Nian Bing looked the strangest, with his hands gently resting on either side of the watermelon, eyes closed, doing who-knew-what.\n\nMental power, like eyes, covered the entire watermelon. For a moment, Nian Bing's mind was filled with red—the red of the watermelon. Under the effect of his mental power, he could hear no sound other than the watermelon. He simply slowly rotated the watermelon in his hands, carefully exploring it with his mental power. What he needed now was understanding—understanding every detail he required—because the culinary skills he was about to display could not have the slightest flaw in control. This required him not only to have a complete understanding of the watermelon's external texture but also to thoroughly grasp the unseen watermelon flesh inside. For ordinary people, this would naturally be impossible. However, Nian Bing's mental power was so strong that it surpassed ordinary Archmages, so this was not a difficult task for him. But to strive for perfection, he could not afford to be careless in the slightest.\n\nMo Mo was the first of the three to move. A small and exquisitely crafted carving knife appeared in her nimble hands. Her White Snow Drifting Heavenly Spirit Hand was equally miraculous when used for carving. Intricate patterns gradually emerged on the watermelon she continuously rotated.",

    "content": "Soon after Momo made her move, Xiao Tian also started. His watermelon was instantly divided into eight portions by a phantom division. The complex cooking movements appeared exceptionally unhurried in his hands. Once he truly began cooking, he no longer paid attention to Nian Bing, fully dedicating himself to his own culinary art. However, after the other nine individuals began their actions, Nian Bing still maintained his original posture, his eyes still closed, slowly rotating the watermelon in his hands.\n\nMost chefs chose to stir-fry watermelon as the main ingredient. After all, fruit platters were too common; to win by unconventional means, unique cooking methods naturally held a significant advantage. Time passed minute by minute. The crowd below was now deathly silent, their eyes fixed on the ten chefs on the revolving platform, especially Nian Bing, who had made his entrance with a fire dragon. But they gradually grew disappointed. The platform spun round and round, yet Nian Bing still made no move. From below, it seemed as if he had fallen asleep standing up.\n\nThe stipulated time for cooking had not changed; each competition was limited to an hour. When an hour had passed, nearly half the chefs had already completed their dishes, while Nian Bing remained standing there. Xiao Tian had finished his cooking. He let out a long breath, casting a satisfied glance at the dish born from his hands, filled with confidence. Under the pressure brought by Nian Bing's appearance, he had performed his culinary art at his peak, using over ten exquisite techniques during the cooking process, feeling very confident of victory. He turned his head to look at Nian Bing, wanting to see what this magic chef had created. When he saw Nian Bing still standing there, he couldn't help but be stunned. \"Why hasn't he moved yet? What is he thinking?\" As a top chef himself, he naturally knew Nian Bing couldn't possibly be asleep at this moment, but even observing the ingredients, it was taking too long. Just as Xiao Tian was wondering, Nian Bing finally moved. His slowly opening eyes revealed two streaks of cold light. When that dazzling, ghostly blue light leaped into his hand, Xiao Tian couldn't help but tremble all over, exclaiming, \"Ghost Carving Divine Blade!\"\n\nThe Ghost Carving continuously danced among Nian Bing's fingers, but he was not in a hurry to cut. With his left hand resting on the watermelon, he lightly flicked the Ghost Carving with his right hand, and a platter a foot and a half in diameter had already appeared on the plain board. A gentle lift with his left hand, and the watermelon settled onto the platter. The instant it landed, Nian Bing shaved a piece off the bottom of the watermelon, allowing it to rest steadily on the platter. Immediately after, nine small cups, each weighing one *liang*, were scooped into the platter by the Ghost Carving, evenly placed around the watermelon, with equal distances between each cup. With a slight smile, a divine light burst forth in Nian Bing's eyes. \"Xiao Tian, watch closely. I'm going to leave you utterly convinced.\" The curved blue light gently kissed the watermelon as it pulsed. This time, Nian Bing did not use his exquisite carving technique, but rather the penetrating blade technique. Each time the Ghost Carving extended and retracted, it would bring out a watermelon seed from within the watermelon, yet it left only very small marks on the fruit. Remarkably, no watermelon juice flowed from those minuscule openings.\n\nAs watermelon seeds leaped out of the platter one by one, Xiao Tian's face grew increasingly solemn. He could rack his brain and still not figure out how Nian Bing knew the exact location of the watermelon seeds inside the fruit; it was simply too miraculous. The Ghost Carving continuously hovered in Nian Bing's right palm. It circled the watermelon, seemingly slow but actually fast. Every movement Nian Bing made caused the watermelon to subtly tremble, but from the surface, the watermelon showed no change. A clear, resonant chant rang out from Nian Bing's lips. His movements gradually quickened, as he chanted: \"Ghost blinds the moon's halo, ice stream shattered. Carved into green parasol, phoenix returns. Divine music, a clear note trills. Blade rings, clouds stir, startling birds fly.\" It was still a chant using the four characters of \"Ghost Carving Divine Blade\" as an acrostic, but it was completely different from before. The Dragon Dance Collection Blade Technique performed with the Ghost Carving could become the culinary world's number one divine blade, not just because it could carve lifelike dragons. Its exquisite intricacies were profound and extensive, applicable in every domain of culinary art. The form Nian Bing was currently employing was another variation of the Dragon Dance Collection Blade Technique, developed by Zha Ji only after he retreated to Peach Blossom Forest. Compared to its previous forms, its refinement was even greater. Xiao Tian was dumbfounded. He had, of course, heard of the Dragon Dance Collection Blade Technique, but this was his first time seeing it. On the main stage, the usually languid Spirit Chef God Na Yan stood up agitatedly, his body trembling slightly. He muttered to himself, \"It's appeared again, has it appeared again? The Ghost Carving, it's really the Ghost Carving! The Dragon Dance Collection Blade Technique, old ghost, I never thought you'd teach such an outstanding disciple! What's so great about the lotus root severed, but fibers connected? This is the true divine blade! Old ghost, old ghost, you've overshadowed us for a lifetime, and now you've trained such a monstrous apprentice. The world has truly changed; these young kids' talents are far superior to ours back then.\" Accompanying the last character 'fly' in the chant, Nian Bing abruptly scooped with the blade. As the Ghost Carving, guided by his right hand, reached its highest point, it vanished instantly. Everything returned to calm. The watermelon was the same watermelon; if one didn't look closely, there seemed to be no change, but everything was finished. Nian Bing was the last to complete, though only a very few could tell that he was done.\n\nTen dishes, all made with watermelon as the main ingredient, were placed on the chefs' respective counters. Hua Pangzi, Na Yan, Hilard, Maomao, and all the judges ascended the stage. The host announced the judging process: first, each chef would describe the characteristics of their dish, then the judges would taste it, and finally, determine the score. Scores would be given in stars, with ten stars being the maximum, proceeding one by one according to the initial roll-call order.\n\nThe first to begin her narration was Momo. Nian Bing placed his hand on the unchanged watermelon in front of him, listening carefully to her description. The host gestured for Momo to begin and handed her the magic amplifier. Momo took the magic amplifier, smiled faintly, and said, \"My dish is called Jade Crystal Cage. Using watermelon as the main ingredient, I first removed the dark green rind, turning it white, and then carved a simple bas-relief of Huaglong Hotel onto it. I cut open the watermelon at one-third of its height, then carefully scooped out the pulp and seeds, hollowing out the inside of the watermelon. At this point, the entire watermelon shell appeared completely translucent.\n\n\"From the outside, you can see the color changes within, like crystal. After removing the seeds from the watermelon pulp, I cut them into small strips, then coated them with egg yolk to lock in moisture, soaking them in coconut milk. Watermelon has a very pure taste, and few ingredients can perfectly match it. Coconut milk is one of those rare ingredients that can complement watermelon. After soaking for a period, I heated a pot and added water. I directly coated the soaked watermelon strips with some batter and boiled them. During the boiling process, I used various auxiliary ingredients to thicken the sauce. Once the batter coating the watermelon strips was cooked, I placed them directly into the watermelon shell, then poured the prepared thick sauce over them. After replacing the watermelon lid, from the outside, the dish looks like a crystal ball, while the watermelon inside, illuminated by the sauce, appears like jade encased within the watermelon shell.\n\n\"That's why it's named Jade Crystal Cage. The entire dish is primarily fresh and sweet, coupled with the refreshing fragrance of watermelon, making it perfectly suitable for people of all ages. Please, judges, have a taste.\" Looking at the crystal-like, white-jade sphere in front of Momo, it was indeed hard to imagine that it had once been a watermelon. Nian Bing secretly marveled. This idea alone was highly original. Although Momo described it simply, the preparation of this dish required highly refined techniques. Just the nearly transparent carving on the watermelon surface demanded great skill, plus the uniform hollowing out of the interior. If one's technique wasn't extremely skilled, it would be easy to puncture the watermelon shell. Momo had described the final cooking process very simply, but Nian Bing realized that she must have used some special techniques and ingredients during the sauce-thickening, otherwise, the liquid couldn't have appeared emerald green. The fusion of coconut milk and watermelon was indeed a brilliant idea, though he wondered about the taste. The judges all cast admiring glances at Momo. Momo personally opened the lid of the watermelon shell, inviting them to taste. An expression of admiration appeared on every judge's face. Demon Marshal Hūguāng smiled slightly, \"The taste is truly excellent, very distinctive, and highly unique. I think it deserves a perfect score.\"\n\nHis words immediately drew agreement from others; the judges all nodded. Maomao slipped to Nian Bing's side and whispered softly, \"Brother Nian Bing, the dish that elder sister made is really delicious! It has a refreshing fragrance and a subtle sweetness; it feels so comfortable in the mouth. You have to cheer up, okay?\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" Xiao Tian suddenly stood up, glanced at Momo's dish, and then said, \"I think it might be a bit premature for the judges to make a decision now.\"\n\nDemon Marshal Hūguāng's gaze fell on Xiao Tian's face. \"Oh? Are you implying that Miss Momo's dish isn't worthy of a ten-star score?\"\n\nXiao Tian shook his head and said calmly, \"I haven't tasted it, so I cannot judge Miss Momo's skill. However, if the esteemed judges are in such a hurry to give scores now, it would be unfair to the chefs who come after. After all, the maximum score is ten stars. If Miss Momo receives such a score, then even if the chefs who follow surpass her in skill, their scores could at most only be equal. This is unfair. I hope the judges can taste all the chefs' dishes before giving their appraisals; only then can it be considered fair and just.\"\n\nHis words were powerful and articulate, pointing out a flaw in the competition's judging process. The judges looked at each other in dismay, momentarily unsure how to decide, after all, there was some truth to what Xiao Tian said. Demon Marshal Hūguāng turned his gaze to Hua Pangzi, who was beside him, and said, \"Do you think this judging rule needs to be changed?\"\n\nBefore Hua Pangzi could speak, Spirit Chef Na Yan, who had been silent all this time, said, \"I think the rule does need to be changed. Chef Xiao Tian makes a lot of sense; we can revise it according to his suggestion.\"\n\nHūguāng turned to Momo and said, \"Miss Momo, what do you think about this...\"\n\nMomo smiled slightly and said, \"Xiao Tian is right; this change is very appropriate. I think his suggestion is excellent; it's fair to every chef.\"\n\nHūguāng smiled faintly, \"Alright, it's decided then. After we've tasted the dishes of the other nine chefs, we'll give out the scores collectively at the end. Xiao Tian, it should be your turn next, right?\"\n\nMomo handed the magic amplifier in her hand to Xiao Tian. A confident smile appeared at the corner of Xiao Tian's mouth as he said, \"My dish emphasizes the character for 'fragrance.' It's called Jade Melted Fragrance. Everyone, please take a look.\"\n\nSaying this, he pointed to the platter in front of him. On the platter was a white block, truly like jade. It was watermelon rind with its outer green layer removed. Upon closer inspection, one could discern that the entire half-foot square \"white jade\" block was composed of many small pieces joined together, yet there were no visible seams. Within this \"white jade\" block, a red light flowed, as if something was inside. The surface of the white jade was even more translucent and crystal-clear, reflecting dazzling light under the sun's rays. Xiao Tian smiled faintly, \"You all must have noticed, this block of mine is made from fourteen 'white jade' strips crafted from watermelon rind. Watermelon rind itself is edible, and after my special processing, it becomes even crisper. And inside these watermelon strips, I hollowed out each one, then used watermelon pulp as the main ingredient to prepare a fragrant juice, which I poured into them, sealing the watermelon rind strips. Finally, I stacked them to create this Jade Melted Fragrance.\n\n\"I won't introduce too much more. Please, esteemed judges, taste it directly. I believe this dish will not disappoint you.\" After speaking, he handed the magic amplifier to the host beside him, stood with his hands behind his back, and remained silent. His gaze met Nian Bing's, as if asking, \"Can you compare to me?\" Nian Bing's expression remained unchanged, but a tumultuous surge of thoughts rose within him. From the surface, many might think that Xiao Tian's method of hollowing out the watermelon rind strips was difficult, especially the need to seal them neatly at the end. However, Nian Bing understood that the key to this dish lay in the juice inside each watermelon strip. Since Xiao Tian stated that the dish primarily emphasized fragrance, then the juice prepared mainly from watermelon pulp must possess a fragrant quality. How did he achieve that? What could be mixed with watermelon juice without affecting the watermelon's taste, yet make it even more fragrant? While Nian Bing was pondering, the judges had already begun. Just as Xiao Tian had said, a red light flickered inside each watermelon strip. When Demon Marshal Hūguāng was the first to bite into a watermelon strip, a rich aroma immediately permeated the revolving platform. That dense fragrance contained the refreshing sweetness of watermelon, but the aroma was even more intense.\n\nNian Bing sniffed intently, quickly identifying the various seasonings in this mixed scent in his mind. Soon, he understood. He looked up at Xiao Tian and nodded at him. \"So fragrant!\" Maomao's delightful sigh seemed to voice the sentiments of all the judges. The crispness of the watermelon rind strips, combined with the warm, extremely fragrant juice, made Xiao Tian's dish almost perfect.",

    "content": "A moment later, including Spirit Chef Na Yan, every judge's face showed an intoxicated expression. In fact, when Nian Bing identified the composition of the watermelon's internal juice, he already knew that Xiao Tian had surpassed Momo. Although the main ingredient in that watermelon was watermelon juice, what truly produced the aroma was something else: raw salted duck egg yolk. Salted duck egg yolk has always been a fragrant food, but when it's raw, it's liquid, just like an ordinary egg yolk. Only after cooking does it solidify and release its fragrance. However, Xiao Tian had precisely used salted duck egg yolk to create this dish. While Nian Bing understood the basic principle of the dish, he admitted he couldn't replicate it. Just preventing the salted duck egg from turning from liquid to solid during heating was something Nian Bing confessed he couldn't do.\n\nEvery judge understood Xiao Tian's previous meaning at this moment. Indeed, his dish, from every perspective, was superior to Momo's.\n\nNext, the remaining seven chefs introduced their dishes one by one. However, compared to Momo and Xiao Tian, they were significantly inferior in both creativity and flavor. After the judges circled the revolving circular platform, they finally arrived before Nian Bing. Having seen the exquisite dishes prepared by the first nine chefs, they couldn't help but show curiosity when they saw the watermelon Nian Bing held down. Because of yesterday's Six-Threaded Coiling Pepper, no one dared to underestimate Nian Bing this time, especially his dazzling fire dragon magic performance upon taking the stage, which had become the focus of this competition.\n\nThe emcee handed the magic amplifier to Nian Bing, looking at the watermelon he held down with a puzzled expression, and said, \"Chef Nian Bing, please begin your introduction.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, holding the magic amplifier. \"Actually, there's not much to introduce about my dish. Perhaps they also saw my preparation process. When making this dish, I didn't use any seasonings. I believe that watermelon itself is the finest fruit; no other fruit can possess the unique characteristics of watermelon. Therefore, with watermelon as the main dish, there's no need for other things to accompany or enhance it. Since watermelon is meant for fruit platters, it should be used that way. Why bother cooking it? There's nothing more to introduce about my dish; please take a look. Its name is Phoenix Blood Juice.\" As he spoke, he released his left hand, which had been pressing on the watermelon, and lifted the platter.\n\nIn the center of the foot-and-a-half diameter platter was naturally the watermelon, and around it, a circle of nine cups. The distance between each cup was perfectly equal. But was this a dish?\n\nJust as everyone was filled with doubt, the watermelon on the platter suddenly moved on its own. Nine thin watermelon threads emerged, falling precisely into the nine cups. Immediately after, those watermelon threads gradually turned red, and a drop of vibrant red juice slid down the threads into the cups. The audience below might not have seen clearly, but the judges on stage were stunned, including Spirit Chef Na Yan. No one understood what Nian Bing had done. The red watermelon juice continuously flowed into the cups along the thin threads. As the juice in the cups increased, the watermelon began to emit faint crackling sounds, like an egg about to hatch, the sound delicate and crisp, without any interruption.\n\nJust as everyone was too astonished to close their mouths, a change suddenly occurred. Faint golden light suddenly emerged from the clear cracks on the watermelon. In an instant, dazzling golden light soared from the watermelon, shooting straight into the sky. At this moment, no one could see anything in front of them. The watermelon Nian Bing held radiated an unusually strong radiance, like the sun itself. It was a sacred aura, a gentle aura. A rich, refreshing fragrance seemed to transport people to a field, and that cool, crisp sensation was so refreshing and comfortable.\n\nFinally, the golden light gradually dimmed. Only a layer of golden light shield still enveloped the platter, making it impossible for people to see what was inside. Nian Bing waved his right hand, and the golden light shield instantly vanished. Gasps of astonishment erupted, because everyone saw that in the center of the platter, there was a lifelike fire phoenix in a pose of soaring flight. Beneath the phoenix's feet were carvings in the shape of flames, looking incredibly miraculous. A cold aura permeated the air, and the fire phoenix, as clear and lustrous as agate, seemed alive, gently rippling as the light halo flowed.\n\nNian Bing offered the platter to everyone. \"Please taste, Phoenix Blood Juice.\" Arc Light was the first to pick up a cup. He gave Nian Bing a deep look, then took a light sip of the juice. Immediately, an ineffable sweetness mixed with a cold sensation instantly penetrated his lungs and spread to every corner of his body. The pores on his skin opened at that moment. A refreshing shiver ran through Arc Light, and only then did an extremely comfortable feeling spread throughout his entire body. He eagerly drank the entire cup of watermelon juice. The sacred aura nourished his body, and the blood in his meridians felt much clearer; it was so comfortable, as if he had been baptized by a healing spell from Light Magic. His mental state instantly reached its peak. The nine delicacies he had tasted earlier were completely forgotten at this moment. His mind contained only the dazzling and magnificent fire phoenix before him. Subconsciously, Arc Light exclaimed, \"Excellent! What a Phoenix Blood Juice! Nian Bing, I'm truly curious. Although I know you applied magic to this dish, what kind of magician are you exactly? A fire dragon appearing, ice-sealing the watermelon for carving, plus that Light baptism illusion just now—all of this shouldn't appear simultaneously on one person, should it?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"There are many magical wonders that we still haven't comprehended. This is just a dish; it doesn't have as many profound mysteries as you say.\" In truth, his dish wasn't extraordinarily remarkable; it was merely ice-cold watermelon juice infused with a Light aura. However, Spirit Chef Na Yan had once said that a dish comprised five elements: color, aroma, taste, intent, and form. When one aspect reached an unimaginable level, it could completely compensate even if the other aspects were slightly lacking. Nian Bing's Phoenix Blood Juice had reached its pinnacle in color, intent, and form, and its aroma and taste were not bad. Coupled with the subtle magical application, it naturally received the judges' praise. No one would consider his dish ordinary.\n\nXiao Tian walked beside Nian Bing and whispered, \"Why do you possess multi-element magic? Using magic in cooking—is that your ultimate skill? However, I doubt the effect of magic on culinary arts. Besides being flamboyant, what else is there? I lost the first round, but not because of your magic. I lost to the Dragon's Dance of the Sky Gathering, the continent's top knife technique. But the same thing won't happen again.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"I'll show you the effect of magic on culinary arts. Your cooking skills are good, but if you want to win against me, your performance just now isn't enough.\" He clearly understood Xiao Tian's feelings at that moment. A true magician would never fail to grasp the effect of magic on culinary arts. It wasn't just about flamboyance; magic could greatly assist culinary arts in many aspects. Just Nian Bing's lightning-fast method of removing watermelon seeds earlier was due to his spiritual power. Without the marvelous use of spiritual power, how could he have detected the position of every single watermelon seed?\n\nThe competition results were quickly announced. Just as Nian Bing and Xiao Tian had surmised in their conversation, Nian Bing received a perfect score of ten stars, while Xiao Tian got nine stars, and Momo eight, placing them in the top three for the first round of the competition. To allow the chefs to perform better, the second round would be held in the afternoon. The ten chefs left the stage one by one and were led by staff to the resting area. They would return for the second round in the afternoon. The resting area had the best facilities; each finalist chef had a comfortable large sofa to rest on, with various snacks and drinks readily available.\n\n\"Nian Bing, come out for a moment.\" Nian Bing had just sat down in the resting area, before he had even settled down, when Spirit Chef Na Yan called him out.\n\n\"Senior, are you looking for me?\" Nian Bing smiled slightly at Na Yan. He held great respect for this senior in the culinary world.\n\nNa Yan nodded and said, \"Nian Bing, how is your master doing? Originally, the first time I saw you, I could tell you were Old Ghost's disciple, but I couldn't be entirely certain. Today, you performed the Dragon's Dance of the Sky Gathering, and I saw Old Ghost's ultimate skill again. The amazing skill of carving through the melon skin was something even Old Ghost had never displayed before. It seems you have surpassed your master.\"\n\nNian Bing lowered his head and said sadly, \"No, my culinary skills are still far from my master's. It's only because magic gave me an advantage. If I hadn't frozen the watermelon pulp beforehand, I wouldn't have been able to complete that carving. In terms of cooking experience, I'm far from comparable to seniors like yourselves. I still have a long way to go. Senior Na Yan, my master passed away over half a year ago.\"\n\nNa Yan trembled violently. \"What? You—you said Old Ghost is dead? How could this be? That's absolutely impossible. Old Ghost's body was the best among us; how could he die?\"\n\nNian Bing sighed. \"Everyone must die. Back then, Master lost his gamble and voluntarily severed his hand and foot tendons. The physical blow was far less severe than the mental one. Perhaps no one could bear that. Master passed away when my skills were perfected. He went very peacefully, perhaps because he had already passed on all his techniques.\"\n\n\"Dead, Old Ghost just died like that. It seems we old fellows are indeed gradually retreating from the stage of history. The culinary world will belong to you young people from now on. Alright, go rest. I'm leaving.\" Na Yan left, his back appearing somewhat desolate. The deep sorrow in his eyes as he departed made Nian Bing think of everything about Cha Ji. Master, oh Master, you had so many friends who cared for you, why did you have to seclude yourself in the mountains back then? If your spirits had been better, perhaps you wouldn't have passed away so early.\n\n\"Big Brother Nian Bing, you're amazing!\" Mao Mao jumped out from somewhere, giggled, and came up to Nian Bing, holding his big hand, her eyes full of excitement.\n\nSeeing Mao Mao, Nian Bing's heavy mood immediately lightened significantly. \"How was it? Was the watermelon juice good?\"\n\nMao Mao giggled and said, \"Of course it was good! But there was just too little. Big Brother Nian Bing, next time, can you make some just for Mao Mao?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Of course. Mao Mao, you should go back too, don't make Senior Hillerd worry.\" He didn't want Mao Mao to be scolded by Hillerd because of him.\n\nMao Mao giggled and said, \"Of course it was good! But there was just too little. Big Brother Nian Bing, next time, can you make some just for Mao Mao?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Of course. Mao Mao, you should go back too, don't make Senior Hillerd worry.\" He didn't want Mao Mao to be scolded by Hillerd because of him.\n\nMao Mao nodded obediently and said, \"Big Brother, you must win the next two rounds too! Mao Mao will be cheering you on!\"\n\nNian Bing laughed, \"I'll do my best. But if you're willing to give me your little pets as ingredients, perhaps my chances of winning will be even greater.\"\n\nMao Mao was startled. Seeing Nian Bing's strange smile, she realized she had been tricked. \"Big Brother Nian Bing, you're so naughty! Don't keep thinking about my little pets, they're all so good. I'm leaving.\"\n\nMao Mao left. Nian Bing returned to the resting room. The other nine chefs weren't conversing with each other, each doing their own thing. Nian Bing was happy to be left in peace, sitting in his spot and entering a semi-meditative state. The pursuit of magic was what he desired most now; he didn't want to waste a single moment.\n\nHillerd and Mao Mao were invited by Demon Marshal Arc Light to rest in the military camp. Sitting in the comfortable carriage, Hillerd closed his eyes, thinking about how Nian Bing's dish had finally been presented. Originally, he had always thought Nian Bing was just a Grand Magician, but when that light magic shone, he realized he had underestimated Nian Bing. An Ice-Fire Dual Source Magician was already extremely rare; why could he also possess the power of Light? What on earth was going on? Should he proceed with his original plan against him, to prevent him from ever getting close to his daughter?\n\nWhile Hillerd was contemplating, Demon Marshal Arc Light spoke. His gentle voice, though comfortable to listen to, was difficult to accept coming from a man's mouth. \"Old Hillerd! What do you think of that chef called Nian Bing? You're an expert in magic; why does he possess three types of magic? Could there be a magician on the continent who can simultaneously cast three types of magic? It can't be that unbelievable, can it? I think he should be a fire magician, and as for the ice and light magic, he should be casting them through magic scrolls.\"",

"希拉德微微一笑，道：「弧光，這次你可走眼了。你不用拐彎抹角的套我，我以前確實認識他，貓貓也認識，他是一名冰火同源魔法師，在魔法方面很有天賦，年紀輕輕就達到了大魔法師的境界，至於他所施展的光明魔法，正像你說的那樣，很有可能是通過魔法捲軸施展的。不過，即使以我的精神力，也沒有感覺到他在施展魔法時過多的精神波動，如果說他是使用的捲軸，他的動作似乎太隱蔽了一些。」\n\n弧光嘿嘿一笑，道：「你們認識就好，老希，你和他熟悉麼？你也知道，現在我這東北親團軍中最缺的就是魔法師。我國除了中央團軍是由國家直接招募魔法師以外，其他的幾個集團軍都是自行招募魔法師的，中央親團軍中擁有的魔法師軍團實在太讓人羨慕了，那個融老兒的號召力極強。現在我這邊，只有二十幾名魔法師，魔導士只有一個，實力參差不齊。如果可以的話，我希望能夠多招些魔法師入軍團，待遇方面好商量，你看，能不能幫我這個忙？」\n\n希拉德沒好氣的瞪了他一眼，道：「幫你？別做夢了。我和念冰一點都不熟悉，而且，你別忘記他是一名廚師。有本事，你自己去招募好了。不過，你招募誰我不管，不要打我們白人的主意，我們召喚魔法師是絕不會參與任何國家軍隊的。」\n\n弧光訕訕一笑，道：「不用說的這麼絕情吧。怎麼說我們也是朋友。你們族人那麼多，如果肯投身到軍隊該多好啊！」\n\n「報告。」馬車外傳來一聲洪亮地呼喊。弧光臉色一整，淡道：「講。」\n\n「稟告元帥大人，城外來了一隊人馬，據說是冰月帝國前來本國參加新銳魔法師大賽的隊伍，包括護衛一共二十餘人，據說是由冰月帝國的七皇子燕風帶隊，是否允許他們進入我國境內？」\n\n弧光猶豫了一下，道：「進入我國境內可以。但是，請他們出示一下參賽的證件，然後就放他們進城。派我們的人秘密監視，如果他們有什麼異常的舉動，立刻向我報告。」\n\n「是，元帥大人。」貓貓靠著自己的父親已經睡著了，希拉德看著弧光，道：「五國新銳魔法師大賽又要開始了麼？為什麼冰月帝國是由皇子護送參賽選手而來呢？」\n\n弧光搖了搖頭，道：「這個我不清楚，不過，據我國的資料顯示冰月帝國這個七皇子一向不得寵愛，嗜武成痴，據說長得很英俊。」\n\n看著弧光臉上隱約的邪氣，希拉德無奈的搖了搖頭，道：「你啊！這臭毛病就是改不了，連人家的皇子都要惦記惦記。弧光，你年紀也不小了，是不是該找個女人成家了。」\n\n弧光無奈的道：「老希，你也知道，我對女人一點興趣都沒有。哎，為什麼我是一個男人呢？在性取向這方面，我看我這輩子是改不了了。你也不用勸我，反正我們家不止我這一個孩子。我父母都對我放棄了。嗯，有機會我要去見見這個七皇子，他要是有念冰那麼俊就好了。不過，念冰不是我喜歡的風格，那種英俊小生是女孩子們的最愛。我最喜歡有男人味兒的。」\n\n「行了行了，你再說下去我要吐了，你這個著名的『南菊花』*，和你在一起真是讓人受不了。我警告你，以後當著我女兒不許露出這種淫蕩的神態，否則，我讓你連男人都搞不了。」希拉德一臉嫌惡之色的看著弧光，沒好氣地斥責著。弧光哼了一聲，溫柔而邪惡的道：「老希，敢當著我的面叫出『南菊花』三個字的，恐怕除了我國陛下就只有你了。」\n\n希拉德翻了個白眼，道：「你不用威脅我，什麼時候等你強大到神師境界再找我報復好了。別忘了當初你在我手下敗過幾回。」\n\n弧光頹然道：「好，算我服了你。媽的，大陸上除了那變態的冰雪女神祭祀以外，真正讓我佩服的也只有你了。我弧光活了三十八年，和你比試那次是輸的最慘的。你那精神魔法也太變態了，再加上龍召喚術，誰能和你抗衡？有本事，你去把那冰雪女神祭祀搞一下好了，聽說，她還是個老處女呢。你要是能把她搞定，我弧光拾你做牛做馬都認了。」或許是因為弧光的聲音提高了一些，貓貓從睡夢中驚醒過來，「小破蛇，搞什麼啊！搞對象麼？\n\n你要和誰搞對象？」弧光頓時被貓貓問得語塞，趕忙掩飾道：「沒什麼沒什麼，我是和你爸爸說是冰月帝國的人到華融來參加新銳魔法師大賽。」\n\n一聽這話，貓貓眼睛頓時一亮，「魔法師比賽？我也要參加。爸，讓我參加好不好？」\n\n希拉德皺眉道：「貓貓，別胡鬧了，那不是你能參加的。必須代表國家才行。而且，你以為這是兒戲麼？以你現在的水平，還不如一名大魔法師，還想參加魔法比賽？等這天華融廚藝大賽的決賽結束後，你就跟我回家，繼續練你的魔法，當有所成就後，我再考慮要不要帶你出來玩兒。你這丫頭啊！就是好奇心太重。」\n\n一邊說著，他還狠狠的瞪了弧光一眼。塔魯城外，在出示了參賽證件後，冰月帝國一行二十餘人共三輛馬車緩緩進入塔魯城。隊伍最前面是一匹白色的高頭大馬，一身銀色甲胃的燕風騎在馬上顯得英姿颯爽，他臉上依舊散發著冰冷的氣息，表情很平靜，眼眸中沒有任何情感色彩流露。在他身後，是六名全身武裝的武士，緊接著是三輛馬車。馬車周圍還有十騎護衛著，一行浩浩蕩蕩進入城中。\n\n初進塔魯城，燕風有些驚訝地發現，這座看似繁華的城市卻並沒有想像中那麼多民眾，放眼望去，街道上極少有人出現，連道路兩旁的店鋪大多也已經關閉了，「來人，塔魯城為什麼這麼安靜？」\n\n一名騎士趕忙策馬上前，恭敬的道：「七殿下，我去打探一下吧，我國在這裡有一家秘密旅店，為了安全起見，我們就到那裡居住。只要穿過塔魯廣場，很快我們就能抵達旅店。」燕風點了點頭，道：「你先去打探一下，看看有什麼情況，回報。」「是。殿下。」騎士答應一聲趕忙去了。\n\n時間不長，那名騎士快馬而回，看到燕風詢問的目光，趕忙道：「殿下，是這樣的。塔魯城正在舉行一個什麼華融廚藝挑戰賽，今天就是決賽，所以大部分民眾都到塔魯廣場那邊去觀看比賽了。現在那邊人山人海，我們想穿過恐怕沒有那麼容易。殿下，您看……」燕風回頭看了一眼身後的馬車，淡然道：「我們過去看著，在塔魯廣場外圍暫時休息，等那什麼比賽結束後再穿過去找宿處。阿二、阿三，你們兩個去購買一些乾淨、新鮮的食物給冰雲小姐和各位祭祀食用。我們在塔魯廣場邊集合。」\n\n「是。」兩名騎士飛騎而去。燕風從馬上跳了下來，走到第二輛馬車旁，道：「冰雲小姐，塔魯城今天有重要的集會。我們可能要誤一段時間才能到宿處，您暫時先在馬車中休息吧。」\n\n如同天籟般地聲音在馬車中響起，「一切由七殿下做主就是，冰雲在馬車中並無不妥。」馬車中傳出的聲音是如此美妙動人，任何音樂也無法比擬這樣動聽的聲音，可惜的是，這聲音卻如同萬載寒冰一般，聽入耳中給人以顫慄地感覺，仿佛說話之人根本就沒有感情存在似的。\n\n燕風皺了皺眉頭，他本身對女人就沒興趣，再加上這位冰雲小姐在冰冷上比自己還猶有過之。這一路上，他雖然是負責護送的，但與這冰雲小姐交談的次數加起來也不過十次而已，每次最多也只是三句話，他早已習慣了。重新上馬，在燕風的帶領下，馬隊朝塔魯廣場方向而去。\n\n除了簡單的進食以外，念冰在第一場與第二場比試中間休息的過程中一直都處於半冥想狀態。終於，第二場比試的時間就要到了。\n\n緩緩睜開眼睛，念冰發現小天正站在自己身旁看著自己。站起身，看著小天道：「時間快到了吧。」\n\n小天點了點頭，道：「同樣的好運不會再降臨到你身上，這次，我要讓你見識到絕對的實力。這次參加比賽對我來說最大的收穫，恐怕就是見識到了你的龍雩集舞刀法吧。這第二場，我也一樣讓你看一場好戲的。」\n\n念冰笑了，「小天，你知道麼？如果你能贏我，那對我來說將是件好事。」丟下這句話，他率先走出了休息區。「好事？」\n\n小天皺了皺眉頭，半晌，才自言自語的道：「勝利使人驕傲，失敗使人進步。或許，他是這個意思吧。這麼看來，第一的失敗對我來說也是好事了？念冰，你從來沒有輸過麼？我也沒有，讓我們今天就好好比一下，看看誰是最後的勝利者。」\n\n漠漠從小天身邊經過，掃了他一眼，微笑道：「不要太執著了。你就是太好勝了，念冰說的沒錯，失敗或許才是好事。」小天笑了，「我明白，不過，失敗是要建立在全力以赴基礎上的。如果全力以赴我都贏不了，那麼，我一定會坦然的接受失敗。要看念冰有沒有這個本事了。走吧，時間真的快到了呢。」\n\n念冰從容地蹬上旋轉圓台，來到自己的廚案前。突然，一個熟悉的身影打破了他心中的平靜。遠遠的，那個人坐於高頭大馬之上，上身挺得筆直，身上散發著清冷的氣息，是他，他怎麼也到華融帝國來了？念冰對於燕風的印象並不壞，但是，燕風那奇特的愛好實在是他無法接受的。\n\n念冰看到了燕風，燕風自然也看到了高台上的他，嘴角處流露出一絲難得的微笑，「念冰，我聽說你是一名廚師時還不敢相信，看來，這是真的了。念冰啊！半年多不見，你似乎變得更帥了。」\n\n說到這裡，他臉上那層冰冷漸漸消融了，看著念冰的眼神也更柔和了些。還好距離比較遠，念冰看不清他臉上的表情，否則，不知道還有沒有心情繼續比賽了。\n\n不過，念冰雖然沒有看清燕風的表情，卻看到了他身後那三輛馬車，馬車上有著他太熟悉的東西了，那就是冰花的標誌，在整個仰光大陸上，只有冰神塔會使用這個標誌。\n\n強烈的仇恨，瞬間充斥著念冰的心扉。父母慈祥而悲傷的容顏不斷在他腦海中徘徊著。冰神塔的人，竟然是冰神塔的人！那三輛馬車裡面會是誰呢？正在這時，中間那輛馬車撩起一道縫隙，清澈而冰冷的目光瞬間穿過近千米空間與念冰對個正著。念冰全身一震，精神力快速的波動著。冰冷的壓迫力雖然間隔千米，卻沒有絲毫減弱的意思。念冰只覺心中一冷，趕忙集中精神力才抵禦住那龐大的壓力，神色微微一變，很快就恢復了正常。\n\n低下頭，不再與那冰冷的目光相對，他在思考著馬車中究竟是誰。此時，他的心情已經穩定下來，因為他已經感覺到馬車中並不是自己的死敵冰雪女神祭祀，否則，單是精神上的壓力就不是自己所能承受的。冰雪女神祭祀畢竟是神師啊！但是，那馬車中的人給他的感覺卻出奇的冷，氣息雖然遠沒有冰雪女神祭祀那麼強大，但卻非常相象。能與七皇子燕風一同前來，會是誰呢？\n\n「好了，經過上午第一場比試之後，目前念冰廚師暫時有十顆星高居決賽榜，我們馬上將開始第二場測試，這一次，將對每名廚師輪流進行測試，各種測試題是我們事先想好的，絕沒有相同之處，也絕對公平。比賽抽籤順序按照第一場比賽的成績以倒序方式開始。」華胖子的話將念冰從思索中驚醒。自己還在參加比賽，一切都等比賽結束後再說吧，只是，有冰神塔的人在，看來，自己的晨露刀是不能用了。\n\n倒序進行比賽麼？這麼說，自己是最後一個了，小天和漠漠排在自己前面。此時，評委們已經走上了高台，魔帥弧光手中拿著一個木箱子，來到上午比賽獲得第十名的廚師身前由他抽籤。那名廚師在箱子裡摸了半天，才拿出一個簽來。華胖子接過紙簽，先向台下民眾示意了一下紙簽封著的印記，這才將簽打開，高聲道：「本簽要求，請抽中的廚師用羊肉做一個湯，湯中不允許放任何配料，湯的顏色最後要呈白色，現在開始，時間限制半個時辰。」一聽完題目，那名廚師立刻動了起來，跑到旋轉圓台中央取羊肉。\n\n魔帥弧光走到第二名廚師面前，由他繼續抽籤。那木箱子中的簽千奇百怪，都是以一樣或幾樣材料為主，再加上特殊的烹飪要求由廚師們完成，其中有一名廚師抽到用蔥做主菜，簡直是倒霉到了極點。如果說第一場比試還完全拼的是實力，那麼這第二場比試中運氣就占了一定成分。\n\n漠漠抽完簽去製作她的菜餚了，下一個輪到了小天。小天沒有任何停頓的隨手抽出一簽交給華胖子。華胖子同樣展示了一下上面封印的印記，這才念道：「本簽要求廚師以麵為菜，可以搭配任意四種輔菜，但菜完成時，卻不能有主菜的感覺。」小天淡然一笑，「簡單。」瞥了念冰一眼，這才向中央的各種材料走去。\n\n最後一個輪到了念冰，弧光走到念冰面前，臉上流露出怪異的表情，用他那特有的柔和聲音道：「念冰，目前你排名第一，要繼續努力嗯。\n\n「小伙子長得真英俊，魔法又好，真是不可多得的人才。」聽著弧光的聲音，念冰的心一陣收縮。想想台下的燕風，心中暗道，這不會又是朵『菊花』*吧。他可是堂堂的華融帝國元帥之一啊！邊想著，他用比小天更快的速度趕忙抽出一簽給了華胖子，然後立刻退到一旁，盡量保持與弧光的距離。華胖子將簽展示後拆開，當他看到簽中的內容時不禁有些怪異的笑了。「念冰啊！或許是因為你的實力強吧，這次你可中大獎了，竟然抽到了所有簽中最難的一個。不過你放心，我們會根據你最後完成的菜給你在所得的分數上加上一顆星。」念冰淡然一笑，道：「那就不用了，我對自己的廚藝有信心，你宣布內容吧。」\n\n華胖子嘿嘿一笑，道：「本簽要求，廚師除了盛放菜的器皿以外，不允許使用任何廚具進行烹調，材料可以任意選擇。現在，你可以開始了，時間限制同樣是半個時辰。」聽了華胖子的話，念冰頓時意識到這加一顆星的簽並不好完成。怪不得他會說這是最難的一簽，對於一名廚師來說，不使用任何廚具進行烹飪，那幾乎是天方夜談。沒有廚具要怎麼烹飪呢？但是，這或許能難得住別人，卻難不住念冰。簡單的想了一下，他轉身朝材料走去。\n\n台下的民眾們本以為念冰占了便宜，但一聽這烹調的要求，頓時流露出同情之色。沒有廚具如果做不出菜來，那加一顆星又有什麼意義呢？燕風身後的第二輛馬車中傳出一聲輕咦，顯然，車中的主人也想著看，念冰是如何不使用廚具進行烹飪的。念冰選擇的材料有三種，分別是鮮蝦、螃蟹和一塊牛肉，沒有選擇任何蔬菜。他將三種材料放在砧板上，扭頭朝旁邊的小天看去，當他看到小天的動作時，不禁大吃一驚。\n\n小天正在揉麵，他的動作很緩慢，但緩慢的動作卻異常有力。看著他那揉麵的姿勢，不禁讓念冰想起了駝廚紫修的「生撕活裂重鷹手」。他在加強麵的勁道麼？他要用什麼樣的方法來烹飪呢？正在念冰疑惑之間，小天的動作突然變了。他猛的將手中之麵提了起來，雙臂在身前合抱，身體如同水波一樣微微的蕩漾著，變換著異常柔和的姿勢。麵落下，竟然憑空懸浮在他雙手之間。他左掌前推，右掌回帶，那團麵已經飛快的旋轉起來。小天的臉上已經沒有了傲氣，變得異常平和，身體不斷做出各種柔和的姿勢，而那團麵就在他的雙手之間不斷跳動著。淡淡的黃色『氣』浮現於麵團周圍，但是『氣』並不內侵，而是隨著小天的動作不斷的運轉著。念冰的眼睛直了。他原本準備處理自己材料的雙手停了下來，雙目一瞬不瞬的盯視著小天的雙手。對他來說，哪怕是輸了這場比賽，也一定要看清楚小天的每一個動作，因為，從小天的動作中他想到了一種手法，那就是冠絕七大禁手的「陰陽調和太極手」。\n\n「太極手」是七禁手中最神秘的一種，只在傳說中出現過，就連念冰的師傅鬼廚查極都沒有見過，只是從典籍中看到過而已。但是，僅僅是傳說卻依舊將它排列在七大禁手之首。據傳說中講，曾有一名廚師，一輩子只會做饅頭，而他做饅頭的手法就是這種「陰陽調和太極手」。「太極手」並不是簡單的處理材料之法，它本身就是一種烹調的方法。「太極手」練到極處，甚至可以憑藉手法本身將材料烹熟。其所蘊涵的味道，是無比奇異的，太極所生，無窮無盡，即使是最頂尖的廚師，也無法分辨出「太極手」烹調出美味的每一種味道。\n\n念冰臉上流露出一絲苦笑，他知道，這場比賽自己已經輸了。無論自己的魔法有多麼精妙，在不使用幾柄頂級神刀的前提下，他無論如何也不可能贏得了這七大禁手之首。不過，他卻並沒有因此而頹廢，畢竟，能夠見識到「太極手」，對他來說已經是非常美妙的事情。\n\n小天的表情依舊平和，他的手就像他的表情，每一次動作都會讓那團麵柔柔的轉動著。突然，他那柔和的雙手猛的一扳，快速旋轉的麵團中飛出一道麵絲，均勻的平鋪在他面前的砧板上。此時，整個旋轉圓台上只剩下呼吸聲。不識貨地人不明白，但畢竟有識貨的人，一旁的魔帥弧光喃喃自語道：「這是怎麼了，天下都變了麼？大魔法師和武鬥家都不來從軍卻當起了廚師，這套手法真是好啊！以守代攻，竟然找不到一絲破綻。」除了念冰以外，九名廚師都在忙碌著。小天的動作已經變了，手中的那團麵已經完全變成了細絲。他沒有看念冰，似乎也沒有感覺到念冰注視的目光，開始了接下來的烹調過程。\n\n正在念冰處於呆滯之時，一個清脆的聲音將他喚醒，「念冰哥哥，加油啊！」抬頭看去，主席台上，貓貓正興奮的向自己抬著手。念冰雙目才一接觸，精神剎那間興奮起來，自己這是怎麼了？「陰陽調和太極手」確實神妙，但是，自己也並不是沒有抗爭之力，只要盡力而為，就算輸了又怎麼樣呢？小天啊小天，我果然沒有看錯你，真沒想到，失傳的「太極手」竟然會在你手中出現，不過，我不會認輸的。\n\n想到這裡，念冰也開始動了。他快速的將自己準備好的蝦去殼，用手指挑掉蝦線，再憑藉手力將活的螃蟹直接捏開，取出蟹黃和蟹肉與蝦肉放在一起，把牛肉與蝦、蟹放在一起，他開始了自己的動作。雙手簡單地活動了一下，念冰開始均勻的拍打起面前的材料，開始時還能看清他出掌的方向，但隨著速度的提升，廚案上只剩下一片掌影。掌拍、掌切、背打，每一個動作都從不可思議地角度出現，念冰的手仿佛沒有骨頭一般，圓轉如意的拍打在面前的材料上，但卻能夠保持材料的汁液並不外流，正是「分筋錯骨如意手」。\n\n隨著他手法加快，三種材料漸漸混合在一起。念冰沒有看，依舊在不斷的拍打著，以蟹入牛肉，使牛肉本身的香味中多了海鮮的鮮美，直到時間過去一半，他的動作才停了下來。深吸口氣，念冰喃喃的念了幾句咒語，一個直徑過三尺的巨冰球出現在他面前。緊接著，是澎湃的火球，火球瞬間包裹了冰球。冰在火中不斷融化著，卻並不蒸發，仿佛被一個無形的罩子遮蓋著。漸漸的，原本的冰球縮小了一些，在半空中凝結成一個水球，水球中的水在灼熱的火焰作用下逐漸沸騰起來。「不讓使用廚具麼？魔法就是我的廚具。」融合了三種材料的圓球被念冰拋了起來。他沒有「千切手」那樣分割材料的技巧，但卻可以將肉揉成球，一個大的圓球逐漸分成數十個丸子直接侵入那沸騰的水球之中，在其內不斷的翻滾著，神奇之處令人嘆為觀止。念冰的心隨著自己的手在動，全神貫注的看著水中翻滾的肉丸。突然，他的雙手同時幻化而起，憑藉著精神力控制著那個水球，飛快的將砧板上的各種調料按比例加入其中。水球按照念冰的想法不斷的波動著，將調料直接打入丸子內。這時，念冰控制著水球來到自己面前，右手探出，手在火焰的包裹中，有節奏的在水中旋轉起來，正是「破水保面玄玉手」。\n\n丸子在他模仿出的「玄玉手」作用下均勻受熱，完全被調料浸透。最後一刻，念冰從空間之戒內取出了自己的紅魂醋輕點入其中。雙手一推一收，數十個丸子已經進入了準備好的大碗之內。完成了，憑藉著冰、火兩種魔法，他在不使用廚具的情況下完成了這道菜，而此時，在他前面開始烹飪的九名廚師也都各自完成了自己的使命。第二場比試的評審與第一場並沒有什麼差別，只是順序改變了一些而已。\n\n念冰此時心中沒有別人，只有小天面前的那盤看上去像是粉絲的菜。\n\n手打！粉絲，那是麵啊！以「太極手」做出的菜會產生什麼味道呢？小天同樣沒有去管別人介紹菜肴，又一次走到了念冰身邊，微微一笑，道：「念冰，我承認自己錯了，沒想到，魔法還可以如此應用到廚藝之中，你在這方面的領悟真的很強。」\n\n念冰同樣微笑的看著他，兩人眼中都流露出惺惺相惜之色。畢竟，對手難求，廚藝到了他們這個層次，想尋找一名對手也並不是件容易的事。「可惜，這場我還是輸了。小天，你先前施展的就是傳說中的『陰陽調和太極手』麼？」小天微笑點頭，「可惜我練的還不到家，告訴你個秘密，其實『太極手』和『重鷹手』一樣，本身就是一種武技，分成不同的階段。我現在還不能發揮出太極無限味的能力，但卻可以憑藉『太極手』將任何材料本身的成分破壞，轉化成我需要的味道，很快你就會明白了。這次來參加比賽真是精彩啊！你的第一刀對上我的第一手，你說，我們最後誰會贏呢？」念冰道：「輸贏對我來說已經不重要了，能見識到傳說中的手我已經不虛此行。等比賽結束後，有機會一定要和你多切磋，我想，這裡絕不會是我們最後的舞台，還有廚神大賽等著我們。不是麼？」\n---\n*Translator's

"小天哈哈一笑，道：「不錯，還有廚神大賽，我想，我們都能成為新的廚神吧。哦，對了，我曾經聽說冰月帝國出了一名神奇的廚師，外號叫做，似乎也是憑藉魔法做菜的，那就是你吧。」\n\n  念冰點了點頭，道：「不錯，既然你向我說出太極手的秘密，我也沒有什麼好隱瞞的。我是一名冰火同源魔法師，擅長冰與火兩種魔法，你也看到了，這兩種魔法都是最適合用在廚藝之中的，雖然你有太極手的玄妙，但是，我不會就這麼認輸的，我們比賽帶有最後一場要進行，到時候才是我們全力揮的最佳時機。」\n\n  很快，輪到小天講解他的菜餚了，小天的講解很簡單，他這道菜就叫魚翅。是的，那些面竟然被他做成了魚翅的味道，再加上輔料，竟然沒有人吃出任何面的氣息，那完全是最頂級的魚翅之味啊！這一現頓時震驚全場，就像沒有人明白念冰是如何隔著外面西瓜皮雕刻出鳳凰一樣，這一次，也沒有明白小天是怎麼做到的，幸好他在烹飪時是當著所有人的面，所以才沒有誰會懷疑他在做假。\n\n  最後，輪到了念冰，憑藉著紅魂醋和冰火魔法對三種材料的烹調，極品冰火丸鮮嫩的味道、柔滑的口感同樣令評委們大加讚賞，他也獲得了極高的好評，最後的結果很快出來了，比賽得分依舊以念冰和小天為，只不過，這次是小天獲得了十顆星，而念冰獲得了九顆，而漠漠依舊同第一場比試一樣，獲得了八顆星的好評，她地廚藝並不是不好，但與念冰和小天比起來，還是要差了一線。\n\n  「我們又一次見識到了頂級廚師們神奇的烹調技藝，這次，雖然是小天廚師獲得了十顆星的第一名。但是由於念冰廚師所抽籤的難度更高，所以我們將給他加上一顆星，同樣是十星滿分。」華胖子興高采烈的宣布著，這次比賽的質量與以往幾界顯然要強的太多了。尤其是念冰和小天的出現。都帶給他極大的震撼。\n\n  「等一下。」念冰突然開口阻止華胖子繼續說下去。\n\n  華胖子楞了一下，道：「念冰廚師，你還有什麼意見麼？你抽地簽雖然很難，但這也是經過我們多方協調後才決定的，也只能如此評分了。」\n\n  念冰微微一笑，道：「華老闆，我並不是覺得結果對我不公平，而是對小天廚師不公平，這場比試，我確實是輸了。請你取消給我加一顆星的決定，我就是九顆星吧，這樣，我和小天廚師的部分相同地，就由最後一場比賽來決定我們之間地勝負，您看這樣可以麼？」\n\n  作為比賽的主辦者。華胖子當然希望比賽變得更加精彩，一聽念冰這話頓時大喜，讚嘆道：「念冰廚師，你真是高風亮節啊，好，就依你所言。最後一場比試，將決定這界華龍廚藝挑戰大賽的結果。好了，第二場比試到這裡，今天晚上，當太陽落山的一刻我們將展開最後一場比試的角逐。」\n\n  念冰和小天相視一笑，結伴走下了比賽台，小天伸了個懶腰，哈哈一笑，道：「真是累死我了，念冰，你知道麼，施展陰陽調和太極手是非常耗費體力的，不知道我晚上還能不能再用出來呢。」\n\n  念冰微笑道：「希望你能用出來吧，我還想再多見識幾次，可惜我練的不是鬥氣，否則非要纏著你把這門絕藝學到手不可呢。」\n\n  聽念冰這麼一說，小天眼睛突然一亮，嘿嘿笑道：「你這是在教我麼？你雖然學不了我的太極手，但我卻可以學習你的寶貝刀法啊！比賽結束後，你等著我纏你吧。」說完這句話，他自己先忍不住哈笑起來。\n\n  「念冰。」冰冷的聲音在不遠處響起，念冰回頭一看，只見燕風正站在遠處看著自己，他地聲音雖然冰冷，但臉上的神色卻異常柔和，「我們又見面了，找個地方聊聊好麼？」\n\n  小天上下打量了燕風幾眼，試探著向念冰總產：「你朋友？」\n\n  念冰點了點頭，雖然他對燕風的性取向很感冒，但燕風畢竟曾幫過他，對他也沒有任何不利的地方，他又怎麼能否認呢？「你先去休息吧，我和朋友出去聊聊。」說完，快步走向燕風。\n\n  燕風看念冰來到自己身邊，臉上的笑容不禁更濃了，兩風一走出廚師休息區，他就迫不及待的道：「念冰好久不見，你還好麼？上次真是不好意思，父親如我回都實在太急，都沒有來得及和你說一聲。」\n\n  念冰微笑搖頭，道：「沒關係，畢竟你地身份不同。」\n\n  燕風輕嘆一聲，道：「你已經知道我的身份了吧。哎，這次父親召我回都，就是為了皇位繼承人一事，包括我在內，父親一種有七個兒子，理論上來說，我們七個都有繼承皇位的權利，父親佌已經大了，為了避免今後出現不必要的爭端，必須要早曰確定繼承人選才行，所以，我才回了都。父親本意是想讓五哥繼承皇位的，但我母親，也就是冰月帝國的皇后卻極力反對，母親為父親生了兩個兒子，一個是我大哥，另一個就是我了。大哥是長子，雖然在才幹上不如五哥，到也並無大錯，在母親和母親一系家庭地支持下，使父親非常為難，直至現在，最終的繼承人選都沒有確定下來。捲入這種權力的爭端實在是一件痛苦的事，我好不容易這次才找了個藉口能夠離開都，沒想到，卻在這裡遇到了你。」\n\n  聽著燕風的敘述，念冰能夠清晰地感覺到他心中的悲哀。生在帝王家，未必就是一件幸運的事，在權力面前，親情已經不再重要，他也曾經有過同樣的感受，不禁輕嘆道：「清音俗世留，紛爭合時休，誰能破名利，太虛任遨遊。」¹\n\n  燕風全身一震。「兄弟，你說的太好了，好一個誰能破名利，太虛任遨遊。你說的對。反正我對權力沒有絲毫興趣，他們願意爭就讓他們去爭好了，我只想做個逍遙王爺，兄弟，等我這些麻煩事結束後，我們一起暢遊大陸如何？」\n\n  念冰臉上的肌肉有些尷尬的牽動了一下，轉移話題道：「燕兄，你這次來華融帝國是因為什麼？華融雖然並沒有對冰月帝國有什麼侵略的想法，但彼此地關係也並不是那麼協調吧。你身為王子，親自來到華融帝國。就不怕他們對你不利麼？」\n\n  燕風微微一笑，有些感激的道：「兄弟，恐怕我來並不是代表冰月帝國。而是負責護送代表帝國來參加五國新銳魔法師大賽地選手而來地。你剛才在上面沒有看到那幾輛馬車麼？」\n\n  念冰心中一動，這才明白過來，是啊，龍智曾經說過，新銳魔法師大賽每個國家都會派遣兩名選手參加，自己是冰月帝國的一名選手。而另一名自然是由冰神塔派出，燕風這次過來，魔法師護送那名冰神塔的參賽選手了，那這麼看，先前與自己精神力碰撞的，就應該是那個人了。「燕兄，我看到了那幾輛馬車，這次冰神塔派誰來的呢？」\n\n  燕風對念冰可以說是知無不言，「新銳魔法師大賽已經開展有很多年了，是五大帝國魔法師角逐的最佳場所，冠軍所得到的不光是榮譽，同時，也是對其他帝國的威懾，對於五大帝國來說，這個比賽是非常重要的。從第一界比賽開始，得到冠軍最多的就是我們冰月和華融帝國了。上一界我們大意了些，被華融得了冠軍，這一界我們一定要得回來，對於這一點，我可是信心十足啊！為了得到這次冠軍，我父親親上冰神請示冰雪女神祭祀大人派出最強地弟子，冰雪女神祭祀大人感念父親心誠，派出了冰神塔中新一代最優秀的魔法師冰雲小姐。冰雲小姐也是這幾年才逐漸嶄露頭角的，卻已經得到了千幻的美譽，她的冰系魔法千變萬化，令人防不勝防。」\n\n  「千幻冰雲？」念冰喃喃的念叨著這個名字，按照龍智所說，參加新銳魔法師大賽地選手年紀都不能過二十五歲，從自己與她的精神力交鋒來看，她的實力不在自己之下，年紀輕輕就達到了魔導士境界，也難怪燕風如此信心十足了。\n\n  燕風再見念冰，顯得很興奮，「不錯，正是千幻冰雲，她這個名字和本人完全不像，尤其是性格，我還是第一次見到如此冰冷的女人，這樣也好，我最討厭那種糾纏不休的，念冰，你也是魔法師，可要和冰雲小姐多學學，這一路走來，她似乎除了吃飯以外都牌冥想之中，也難怪魔法實力會如此高深了。哎，可惜父親非要給帝國的魔法師工會一個參賽名額，否則，只要冰神塔派出兩名選手，這新銳魔法師大賽每一界地冠軍還不都是屬於我們的麼？」\n\n  念冰心中暗暗苦笑，燕風啊燕風，恐怕你沒想到，在你心中認為是廢柴的另一個選手就站在你面前。\n\n  正在念冰思索著如何才能擺脫燕風之時，一個柔柔的聲音響起，「念冰廚師，你不去休息準備最後一場比賽，在這裡幹什麼呢？」\n\n  不用看，念冰也知道來的是誰，心中突然有些好笑，如果這位魔帥弧光真的有那方面的愛好，那麼，他和燕風到是一對了，一個是來自極北冰月帝國的北菊花，一個是華融帝國著名的魔帥南菊花。²\n\n  「弧光元帥您好，這位是我一個遠道而來的朋友，我和他聊幾句就去休息。」\n\n  聽到弧光二字，頓時引起了燕風的注意，眼中冷光連閃，淡然道：「你魔法師魔帥弧光？最近，你們華融帝國的活動似乎頻繁啊！」\n\n  弧光也看到了燕風，眼中頓時一亮，微笑道：「七皇子來到我們華融帝國就先到了我的領地，真是讓弧光興奮啊！七皇子比傳說中還要英俊的多，只是顯得冷了一些。」\n\n  燕風眉頭微皺，看著面前這相貌英俊不再念冰之下，眉宇間卻有一股陰柔之氣的魔帥，心中不斷碟片著對方的實力，他既然敢來這裡，就沒怕被人認出身份，但是，他也沒想到這麼快就見到華融帝國東北集團軍的腦。\n\n  「魔帥大名燕風早就聽說過，傳說中，你似乎是華融帝國最年輕的武聖，幾年前我有幸拜見冰雪女神祭祀大人時，還聽她提起過你，據說，那一次你在冰雪女神祭祀大人面前竟然堅持了頓飯工夫才敗北，真是令我佩服啊！」燕風雖然說的很平淡，但語氣已經不怎麼客氣了。\n\n  看著這南北兩大菊花碰撞出的火花，念冰心中一陣叫苦，天啊，夾兩個有特殊傾向的男人之間，絕不是件享受的事。\n\n  弧光微微一笑，目光變得更加柔和了，上下看著燕風，「小伙子說話要注意分寸，冰雪女神祭祀我早晚還會再去拜訪她的，不過，她的年紀似乎已經不小了。」\n\n  燕風冷哼一聲，道：「女神祭祀大人與天地同壽³，就算歲數再大，她也永遠是冰月帝國的支柱。我想，我和你之間沒有什麼好說的，念冰，我們走，到外面去聊聊。」說完，伸手就去拉念冰。\n\n  念冰反應極快，不著痕跡的躲閃過燕風這一拉，跟著他向外面走去，少一朵菊花在身旁綻放總會好一點。\n\n  鑽入人群中，念冰已經帶上了自己的斗笠，廣場上的民眾們已經被調動起了極大的熱情，他可不希望自己成為民眾圍觀的對象。燕風身上散著淡淡的白光，不仔細看根本辨別不出，但熟悉各種元素的念冰卻清晰的感覺到，他的鬥氣竟然是光明屬性的，廣場上民眾雖多，但兩人所過之處，人群頓時被鬥氣微微排開，正好能夠容他們穿過。\n\n  眼看那三輛馬車越來越近，念冰心中的仇恨火焰不斷燃燒著，他的心在收縮，冰神塔，令自己失去美好童年的冰神塔，令自己失去至愛父母的冰神塔，總有一天，我會親手將你毀滅。\n\n  周圍一輕，兩人已經從人群中鑽了出來，燕風吩咐手下騎士一聲，帶著念冰向廣場旁略清淨一些的大樹下走去，念冰在經過那三輛馬車時，特意看了一眼第二輛馬車，雖然車簾已經放下，但那冰冷的感覺卻依舊存在著，仿佛那馬車本就是一塊巨大的冰。\n\n  念冰眼中流露出一絲淡淡的寒光，千幻冰雲，不久後，我們一定會交手的，我對冰神塔的報復，就從擊敗你開始吧。落冰神塔的面子絕對是他最願意做的事。\n\n  「念冰，你怎麼會到這裡來參加廚藝比賽呢？「燕風的聲音已經重新變得溫和了。\n\n  念冰淡然一笑，目光依舊停留在中央那輛馬車上，道：「冰雪城是好，但那裡畢竟不是我的家，我答應過傳授我廚藝的師傅，一定要游遍大陸，將廚藝揚光大，成為大陸上最好的廚師。所以，我才會來這裡參加比賽，只有多見識更多的廚藝高手，才能讓我有更大的提升。「\n\n  燕風眼中流露出嚮往的神色，「真羨慕你啊！如果我也能像你這樣天高任鳥飛該多好。⁴能夠游遍大陸每一個角落一直是我的願望。「\n\n  感受到燕風的落寞，念冰扭送向他看去，伸手在他肩膀上拍了拍，道：「別想那麼多了，一切都會成為過去，一切都不是那麼重要，你有你的勘誤苦衷，我同樣也有著苦衷，沒有誰能夠永遠一帆風順的⁵。看開點吧。就像你自己說的那樣，做一個逍遙王爺不是很好麼？「\n\n  燕風哈哈一笑。道：「是啊！逍遙王爺，等父親正式確定王位繼承人後，我就能重新恢復自由，到時候我一定會再找你的。「\n\n  正在這時，一名騎士快步來到燕風身前，恭敬的道：「殿下，廣場上的人已經少了一些，我們可以過去了。「\n\n  燕風眼底深處閃過一絲不舍，向念冰微笑道：「跟我們一直去投宿吧。我們也好多聊一會兒。「\n\n  念冰搖了搖頭。道：「不了，我就先不去了，晚上我還有一塊比賽，有一段時間才開始，我想先回住的地方休息一會兒，也好養足精神。「\n\n  燕風向念冰伸出了自己的右手。「加油，你一定會贏的，晚上我來看你比賽。「\n\n  念冰雖然心中有些不願，但還是與他右手相握，「謝謝，不論輸贏，我都會盡全力。「見識了小天地陰陽調和太極手，他已經沒有絕對把握。\n\n  目送著燕風和那三輛馬車漸漸遠去，念冰現，自己對燕風已經不像原來那麼厭惡了，他雖然貴為王子，但是，他卻並不快樂，王子的身份帶給他太多地束縛與責任了，除了性取向以外，燕風算的上是一個可交的朋友。此時此刻，念冰心中對燕風的排斥正在逐漸消失。\n\n  看了一眼漸漸散去的人群，念冰轉過身朝自己的旅店走去，回去休息一會兒吧，等晚上兩晉參加比賽，安靜的環境才能更適合自己冥想。\n\n  正準備回旅店，念冰耳中突然聽到一個聲音，「念冰，我有事找你，跟我來。「回頭看時，只見希拉德正站在不遠處向自己點了點頭，然後轉向朝塔魯廣場外走去。短短的一瞬，念冰並沒有從希拉德臉上看出什麼，他的自己會有什麼事呢？快步跟上希拉德，兩人一前一後，朝塔魯城深處走去，拐入一個清淨的小巷後希拉德停下了腳步，念冰走到他背後一丈外站了下來，」前輩，您找我有什麼事？「\n\n  希拉德緩緩轉身，念冰從他身上感受到了一絲冰冷地氣息，「念冰，在人類之中，你確實算地上非常出色了，年紀輕輕，不但是一名大魔法師，更是一名優秀的廚師，再加上你英俊的外表，很容易就能給人以好感。但是，你知道麼？你的這些好處卻給你帶來了殺身之禍。「\n\n  希拉德右手一振，手腕上緊箍的手鐲散出一層淡淡地銀光，一個捲軸跳入他手中，「很快你就會明白的。「沒等念冰做出反應，他已經打開了那個捲軸，銀光形成一個巨大的光罩將他與念冰完全籠罩在其中，周圍的一切瞬間被銀光所包裹，念冰意識到，這是一個空間傳送捲軸，從法力波動上感應，應該不會過七階，是中短距離傳送魔法捲軸，希拉德要幹什麼？從他語氣來看，難道他想殺自己麼？\n\n  銀光一閃，當念冰再次看清眼前的景物時，他和希拉德已經來到了一個山谷之中，周圍群山環抱，放眼望去，整片山谷都籠罩在一層灰濛濛的氣息中，希拉德似乎也不知道自己的傳送捲軸將他們傳到什麼地方，剛一現出身形，立刻仔細打量起了周圍的一切。\n\n  「前輩，您用的是無定位中距離瞬間轉移捲軸哪，這應該是個六階的空間魔法，如果是定位傳送的話，就能達到八階了。「\n\n  希拉德停止了觀察，淡然一笑，道：「你應該明白我為什麼會帶你來這裡吧，是你自己了斷還是由我動手，這裡人煙稀少，到也是個不錯的埋骨之所，你放心，我會留下全屍給你的。可惜了你這麼好的一位廚師。你要是有什麼後事，現在還來得及交代，我全儘量為你去辦的。「\n\n  念冰平靜的看著希拉德，「是因為貓貓吧。前輩，從我們第一次見面的時候，您似乎就很為貓貓擔心，似乎怕我與她生些什麼，其實，我一直都只是把她當成一個可愛的小妹妹。當然。您可以不相信我的話。但是，你仔細想想。就算我死了，以後只要貓貓還接觸普通人類，她就會遇到她喜歡的人。會遇到英俊的男子，難道您要將所有貓貓遇到的男性都殺光麼？「\n\n  希拉德冷哼一聲，「你什麼都不用說了，龍召喚師的衣缽必須由貓貓來繼承，她是我唯一的女兒，所以。就算為她殺了天下的男人。我也絲毫不會手軟，我從來沒覺得自己是一個善良的人，為達到目的不則手段一向是人類最擅長的，雖然我是白人⁶，但也是人類。如果你沒有什麼遺言，那麼就動手自裁吧。當然，你也可以選擇反抗，但是，我要提醒你地是，在精神魔法中死亡，是一種極痛苦地事。「\n\n  從希拉德眼中，念冰看的出他對自己地蔑視，確實，人家是堂堂的龍召喚師，擁有著級魔導師境界的強大精神力，再加上奇異的精神魔法，確實是自己不可能對付的，但是那頭叫卡羅迪里斯的風龍，就可以輕易將自己毀滅，這一刻，念冰不禁想起了加拉曼迪斯，如果有他在身旁，這樣的威脅恐怕也不會出現了吧，想歸想，但他還是要面對現實，雖然他不想和希拉德動手，但是希拉德眼中的殺機卻已經清晰的告訴他這一切都是真地，並不是在演戲，想殺我是麼？希拉德，我已經不是半年前地念冰了。\n\n  念冰笑了，「前輩，在我死之前只有一個願望，不知道您能否答應。「\n\n  希拉德點了點頭，道：「你說吧，只要我能做到。「從內心來說，他對念冰還是非常欣賞的，年輕的冰火同源魔法師，未來的前途不可限量。\"\n\n  念冰道：「您是一名就是，我也是，我想，就算是死，我也願意死在您的魔法之下，不論有多麼痛苦，所以，我想與您決戰，但是，您是前輩，在決戰之前，能不能讓我先畫一個魔法陣，這樣，或許我會堅持的久一些。「\n\n  「魔法陣？「希拉德有些疑惑地看著念冰，從念冰的眼神中，他沒有看出什麼，」念冰，你還會畫魔法陣麼？那似乎是空間魔法師的專利。「\n\n  念冰微微一笑，道：「我一直都喜歡魔法陣，後來得到一位老師的指點，對魔法陣有了些初步的認識，不知道您能否給我這一點時間呢？「\n\n  希拉德淡然一笑，道：「你畫吧，我給你一頓飯的工夫⁷，不過，你不用想試圖逃跑，就算你身上有空間魔法捲軸也是無效的，因為這周圍方圓百丈之內，已經完全被我的力封死，沒有我的同意，任何傳送類魔法都會完全失效。「\n\n  念冰苦笑道：「前輩，您看我想能擁有空間魔法捲軸的人麼？「空間魔法捲軸，是所有魔法捲軸中最珍貴的，尤其是擁有傳送能力的魔法捲軸，那可都是救命的好寶貝啊！念冰身上確實沒有，自從擁有了璇璣刀以後，他不止一次想試圖製作出空間魔法捲軸，但是，最終的結果都是以失敗告終，不知道為什麼，他在製作的時候總會覺得缺了點什麼東西似的，或許，是因為自己以擬態魔法製作的的關係吧。面對眼前的強敵，念冰心中暗暗誓，如果能逃的出眼前的這一劫，自己以後一定要製作出空間系魔法捲軸。\n\n  沒有浪費一點時間，一聽希拉德同意自己畫魔法陣，念冰強忍著心中的興奮，雙手分持冰雪女神的嘆息和火焰之神的咆哮，紅、藍兩色刀光同時閃動，快的在地上刻畫著複雜的紋路，剛開始時希拉德並沒有過多的注意，但隨著念冰的雙手由於度過快已經變成了兩色幻影，這才引起了希拉德的注意，身為一名龍召喚師，他自然對魔法陣也有一定的研究，越複雜的魔法陣，所能體現的威力就越強大，看念冰那繁瑣的動作，以及地面上這個不斷成型的魔法陣，他心中隱隱有了一絲不安的感覺，這個魔法陣看上去外表古樸，似乎並不是普通的魔法陣，而且畫起來如此複雜，究竟它有什麼樣的功能呢？不安逐漸的增強著，希拉德突然驚訝的現，念冰身上竟然散出一層淡淡的霧氣，他的額頭上已經布滿了汗水，顯然因為這個魔法陣而消耗了大量的精神力。看到這裡，希拉德的心反而平靜下來了，在他心中，念冰畢竟只是一名魔法師，就算耗盡他的精神力，畫出的魔法陣也不會給自己帶來太大的威脅，更何況，那明顯不是空間傳送魔法陣，應該是增強攻擊力的而已，這小子真是不自量力，消耗了那麼多精神力，就算他的魔法攻擊力增強了，沒有良好的控制又能起到什麼作用呢？\n\n  頓飯時間眨眼過去了，地面上已經出現了一正一反兩個魔法陣，正魔法陣的紋路與一般魔法陣類似，以火焰之神的咆哮刻畫面出，呈現為紅色，而那個反魔法陣在畫的時候，不是從邊緣勾勒起，而是從內部的細小符號開始進行刻畫，當正魔法陣完成之時，反魔法陣也正好竣工了，微微一笑，念冰眼中流露出一絲淡淡的寒光，那紅、藍兩色融合的魔法陣，感受著魔法陣被壓抑的氣息，他知道，自己已經接近了成功的邊緣。雙手握住兩柄魔法刀的刀柄聚攏在胸前，低聲吟唱道：「冰，你是寒冷的代表，火，你是灼熱的源泉，冰與火的氣息啊，請你們允許我將你們的特性融合，以你們共同的源頭為引，共鳴吧。」\n---\n¹

    "title": "Chapter 91 Ancient Magical Sleep Eternal (Part 1)",
    "content": "The Stone of the Ice Goddess and the Stone of the Fire God simultaneously gleamed with an unusually dazzling brilliance. The magic array seemed to come alive; at the center of the array core, a ball of intertwined red and blue light rose, continuously pulsing and shimmering. Suddenly, the surrounding world seemed to change; the red and blue vanished simultaneously, and everything turned faint and pale. Nian Bing and Hilahd both swayed, clutching their heads as they fell to the ground, expressions of agony on their faces. The magic array on the ground had now subtly transformed into a faint purple, with every magic symbol within it slowly revolving around the array. And the world Nian Bing and Hilahd could see had completely turned purple, everything so real yet so illusory.\n\nNian Bing continuously gasped for breath, large drops of sweat rolling down. Though in extreme pain, his face revealed a true smile, a smile of exhilaration. Even a Dragon Summoner had been outsmarted by him. How could he not be excited? His internal magic power remained, but his spirit power had been completely drained, leaving him only able to support his body with basic consciousness. For a magician, losing spirit power was equivalent to losing control over magic. If one were to rashly chant spells, there was a high chance of being consumed by one's own magic. However, none of this mattered to Nian Bing anymore; he had achieved his goal. Looking at Hilahd, who was in even greater pain than himself, Nian Bing's lips curled into a faint smile. He forced himself to compose his thoughts, suppressing his feeling of weakness, and stood up. \"Didn't expect this, did you, Senior Hilahd? I imagine you never thought I could use such a magic array to deal with you. To be honest, when I was carving this magic array, even I wasn't sure if I could succeed.\"\n\nPreviously, the moment the magic array unleashed its power, Hilahd had already sensed trouble, but it was too late to react. A needle-prickling sensation instantly surged into his brain. His powerful spirit power, which he had always been so proud of, flowed out like lightning, and his control over it completely vanished. Amidst the intense pain in his brain, he fell to the ground. At this moment, listening to Nian Bing's words, he had somewhat recovered his wits, not his strength. It was because his spirit power had almost entirely disappeared, so his brain no longer hurt. A strong sense of dizziness continuously assailed him. Hilahd was filled with regret. He had never imagined that \"he who hunts geese all day would one day have his eye pecked out by a goose.\"* Struggling, he also stood up. Looking at the purple-light-shrouded magic array, his body trembled. \"Is this... the legendary restricted magic array?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, saying, \"Senior, you didn't expect this, did you? Actually, generally speaking, this array isn't very useful. Its effect is only to suppress spirit power within a thousand zhang† radius. As long as one steps outside this range, it will naturally recover. It's an array that suppresses a magician's strength. However, the greater benefit of this array is probably for dealing with people like you, the Whitemen. Whitemen themselves don't possess magic power; your proficiency in spirit magic is entirely derived from spirit power. Under the effect of this magic array, I'm afraid your powerful spirit magic can no longer be cast, can it? Even summoning spells require spiritual connection. Without spirit power, even if you are a powerful Dragon Summoner, you are now no different from an ordinary person. Am I right?\"\n\nHilahd endured his physical discomfort and let out a cold snort, saying, \"Indeed, I am no different from an ordinary person. But as you also said, as long as I step out of this thousand-zhang radius, my spirit power will recover. This magic array limits my magic, but it also limits yours. I don't believe you dare use magic now. Without spirit power to control it, it might not be me who dies in the end.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Indeed, Senior, you are absolutely right. Right now, I truly don't dare use magic. Otherwise, if something goes wrong, we'll both perish. Senior Hilahd, I've always held you in high regard, yet I never imagined you would try to kill me for your own selfish reasons. Originally, for Mao Mao's sake, I shouldn't have made things difficult for you. But I certainly don't want to be hunted down by a powerful Dragon Summoner in the future. After all, good luck doesn't come often. Senior, your loss today lies in that sliver of mercy you showed after deciding to kill me. Neither of us has magic now, so I think we can start close combat. Under my blades, I wonder how long you can last? You should remember, I am a chef. As a chef, my physical strength is much greater than that of an ordinary magician.\"\n\nThe Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God were raised respectively. Nian Bing walked step by step towards Hilahd. At this moment, his heart was filled with killing intent. Although Hilahd was Mao Mao's father, if he didn't kill him, he would surely be killed by him. To survive, killing the opponent was the only choice.\n\nFeeling the aura emanating from the two divine blades, Hilahd's face grew increasingly grim. Indeed. For a Summoner, the most terrifying thing was having their spirit power restricted. However, magic that could restrict spirit power simply didn't exist; only the legendary restricted magic arrays could possibly achieve this. Facing this fellow, who was merely a Great Magician, yet capable of drawing such a lost array — he was already a public enemy of all Whitemen. As long as he existed, Whiteman Summoners would be completely restricted. But now, how could Hilahd possibly resist? The massive loss of spirit power had harmed him far more than Nian Bing. Nian Bing had already expended a large amount of spirit power when drawing the magic array, so for him, the loss of spirit power didn't bring too great a burden. But Hilahd was different; as a Summoner, spirit power was his lifeblood. Whether it was summoning spells or spirit magic, both had to be based on spirit power.\n\nWith a slight smile, Nian Bing suddenly stopped. \"Senior, I think if you die without knowing what this magic array is called, you'll regret it deeply even in hell. This magic array is an ancient magic array that I accidentally found in a classic text. When I first saw it, it was incomplete, missing its most crucial activation part. To figure out how to activate it, I theoretically designed countless ideas. I finally realized that this kind of magic array requires a balanced state of magic elements to activate, and my Ice-Fire Homologous ability just happens to achieve that. However, what attracted me to this magic array was merely its complexity and unique properties. I originally didn't plan to use it. After all, restricting spirit power offers no benefit to me either. But just now, when you tried to kill me, I suddenly thought of it. Isn't this magic array precisely the bane of Summoners like you? As long as you step into the range of this magic array before casting a summoning spell, everything becomes easy. Remember this clearly. The name of this magic array is 'Eternal Slumber,' meaning the slumber of the spirit. Senior, you can rest assured and depart. I will do my best to take care of Mao Mao. And there's one thing I must reiterate: I have absolutely none of the feelings for Mao Mao that you imagine; I truly only regard her as a younger sister.\" As he spoke, the blades in his hands were already raised.\n\n\"Wait a moment!\" Hilahd suddenly roared. His weakened body tried to dodge backward, but due to his spiritual exhaustion, he couldn't exert any strength. His physical condition was indeed far worse than Nian Bing's. Nian Bing looked at Hilahd. He was no longer in a hurry at this point. Anyway, after killing Hilahd, he had no intention of returning to Da Lu City, because he didn't know how he would face Mao Mao. After all, he had lost loved ones before, so he naturally understood the pain of losing a father. However, the current situation compelled him, and he had no choice but to do this. Don't kill, or be killed – a simple choice between two, requiring no extensive deliberation.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing temporarily halt his movements, Hilahd forced a bitter smile. \"Boy, you are smarter than I thought, and your schemes are much deeper. Magic is indeed different from martial arts; under special circumstances, even the strongest magician will suffer. However, your magic array is not without its flaws. I doubt its control range is as large as you claim. Furthermore, if I were a magician like you, with strong magic power, I could completely break out of this magic array. At the Archmage‡ stage, even without spirit power, one isn't entirely unable to control magic. From a certain perspective, your magic array is specifically designed to deal with us Summoners. To be frank, I don't want to die. I have a beloved wife and daughter. If you let me go now, I can swear I will never harm you again. Not now, nor in the future. What do you say?\" Faced with a life-threatening crisis, Hilahd bowed his head. He wasn't a man afraid of death, but he didn't want his wife to lose her husband or his daughter to be without a father. Thinking of his wife and daughter's sorrowful faces, he had no choice but to yield to Nian Bing. As a proud Dragon Summoner, this was the first time Hilahd had ever admitted defeat in his life.\n\nNian Bing paused, somewhat stunned. Hilahd was indeed a formidable Archmage. He was right; the thousand-zhang distance he had mentioned earlier was just a bluff. With his current Ice-Fire Homologous magic power, it was simply not enough to support such a long distance. The magic array could only control a radius of a few dozen zhang at present. Moreover, the flaws Hilahd pointed out were indeed accurate. Long Zhi had once told Nian Bing that this magic array was completely ineffective against magicians above the Archmage stage, because at the Archmage stage, even if one lost spirit power, while they couldn't completely control magic, they could still control its direction. As long as they destroyed the magic array or killed all enemies, everything would be meaningless. If it weren't for this, Nian Bing would have long since used this magic array to seek out the Ice Goddess priestesses.\n\n\"Senior, what makes you think I should trust your words? Even if you are a trustworthy person, playing word games is easy. You only said you wouldn't kill me, but you didn't say your tribesmen or pets wouldn't kill me. As a powerful Summoner, you have too many ways to deal with me. I am just one person, a small magician, a small chef. I cannot take that risk.\" Nian Bing looked at Hilahd. With the opponent completely unthreatening, he spoke his true thoughts. For his own life, killing him to silence him was the best method now. After all, when he and Hilahd left, no one saw them. As long as he killed Hilahd and went far from Da Lu City, even if someone suspected him, there would be no evidence.\n\nHilahd angrily retorted, \"Are you questioning my integrity? What kind of person do you take me for, to do such a despicable thing?\"\n\nNian Bing calmly said, \"As the saying goes, 'the world is unpredictable.' I once risked my life to save Mao Mao, yet aren't you trying to kill me today? Your mind can change very quickly, but I don't want to play games with my own life. How about this: you swear that for the rest of your life, you will not use any means to retaliate against me or harm me, otherwise the Whiteman tribe will be utterly destroyed. Only then can I believe you.\" He knew very well that for Summoners of the Whiteman tribe, oaths involving divine retribution were utterly ineffective; they inherently hated the heavens. Hilahd's Achilles' heel was his own tribesmen.\n\nHilahd's expression kept changing. \"Nian Bing, you are truly ruthless! Alright, alright, alright, I swear it. However, you should be careful; a person too despicable will not come to a good end.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, saying, \"I don't think there's anything despicable about me. I'm merely protecting myself better. Is that wrong? I need to live; I still have many things to do. Senior, I still want to return to Da Lu City to participate in the final competition. Please, hurry and swear your oath.\" He smiled. At this moment, his heart felt lighter. Not having to kill Hilahd was naturally the best choice.\n\nHilahd let out a resentful grunt, pointed a single finger at the sky, and stated in a deep voice, \"I, Hilahd, swear that if Nian Bing does not harm me today, I will not, in my lifetime, use any method or means to harm him. Should I violate this oath, may my Whiteman tribe vanish from the annals of history forever.\" During the oath, his voice trembled, showing that his anger had reached its peak.\n\nNian Bing felt a surge of pride in his heart. To be able to force a Dragon Summoner to swear not to harm him—he was probably the first to ever achieve such a feat. Just as he was about to put away his blades and deactivate the magic array, an unexpected change suddenly occurred. The valley shook violently, and rumbling sounds continuously echoed. The purple magic array emitted a heaven-reaching purple light. In an instant, the entire valley was enveloped in purple. This time, the magic array's power truly extended a thousand zhang away, but it only lasted for an instant. Just as Nian Bing and Hilahd felt their spirit power begin to recover as the magic array disappeared, the earth suddenly cracked open. Massive fissures ran through the entire valley, black-grey aura surged skyward, and wave after wave of cold, sinister energy spread forth.\n\n---\n*   A Chinese idiom meaning to be outsmarted by someone you underestimated, or to be hoist with one's own petard.\n† One zhang (丈) is a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or 10.9 feet.\n‡ 魔導師 (Módǎoshī) is translated as Archmage, a high-tier magician. The literal meaning is 'magic guiding master' or 'magic conductor master'.",

    "content": "Nianbing subconsciously lunged at Shilade, grabbing him and pulling him aside, just dodging a crack that spread from behind Shilade. Before the two could even feel lucky, with a thunderous bang amidst the violent tremor, they could no longer control their bodies, tumbling through the air and falling towards the bottomless abyss. As they fell, Nianbing tightly clutched Shilade's arm, sent his two blades into his ring, and using the little mental energy he had just recovered, he summoned his Xuanji Blade.\n\nDarkness engulfed Nianbing and Shilade's figures. The black mist was filled with an icy coldness. The valley, already scarce in life, had now turned into a death zone. Both plants and animals were gradually dissolving within this black mist. A Dead Valley was gradually forming. It seemed as if countless shrill roars echoed through the valley; that was an abnormally icy evil power, an immensely vast evil aura.\n\nTalu City. Maomao was bored, sitting on the podium, eating food brought by the staff. As she ate, she grumbled discontentedly, \"Why isn't Daddy back yet? Didn't he say he'd just wander around to stretch his legs and be back soon? Where did Nianbing Gege¹ go? He was just here. He must be resting, right? The competition is about to start.\"\n\n\"Maomao, eat less, or you'll turn into a little fat cat.\" Huguang's teasing voice suddenly rang out. Maomao looked up at the Demonic Marshal, who was so handsome he didn't look like a man. She snorted and said, \"Little rascal snake, *you're* fat! I'm the beautiful girl Maomao, is there anyone with a more perfect figure than me? Hmph. And if you say my figure isn't good, I'll have Daddy teach you a good lesson. I heard you really like being attacked by mental magic, oh. Hehe, these past few days, aside from the competition, have been so boring, oh, little rascal snake, I want to go play in your army camp again, will you take me?\"\n\nSeeing Maomao's ill-intentioned gaze, cold sweat broke out on Huguang's back. He would rather charge into the Emerald Army than be an enemy of this girl Maomao. This little witch truly gave him a headache. \"No need. Maomao, how about Uncle takes you to play somewhere else another day? There are also many fun places in Talu City. Tonight's competition will be even more exciting than during the day, as it will determine the final champion. Also, that kid named Nianbing is a magician. Cooking with magic will definitely be more dazzling tonight.\"\n\nSure enough, as soon as Nianbing was mentioned, Maomao's attention was immediately diverted. A faint smile appeared on her pretty face. \"Yes! Yes! Nianbing Gege's cooking is the best! He's definitely going to win the championship today.\"\n\nAt this moment, in a corner of Talu Plaza, the vampire Pingchao, dressed in commoner's clothes, was eating food he had just bought from the Hualong Restaurant with his young master Youyou. As she ate, Youyou grumbled discontentedly, \"Pingchao Gege². Why can we only eat this? I want to eat the food made by the chefs on that round platform. The things they make are so special, oh, they must be very delicious, right?\"\n\nPingchao whispered, \"Youyou, don't make trouble anymore, we should go back now, shouldn't we? Otherwise, if Moon Lord comes down, I won't be able to bear the responsibility!\" Just as he said this, Pingchao suddenly trembled all over. His gaze shot towards the distant sky, a flash of blood-red light flickered in his eyes, and his body convulsed slightly from excitement. \"This, this is the aura of our kin. Young master, it's the aura of our kin!\"\n\nYouyou was stunned for a moment, and said, \"Our kin? Do you mean those powerful beings who roam outside? Didn't Daddy say they were all sealed away back then?\"\n\n\"No,\" Pingchao said, though he tried his best to lower his voice, the excitement in his heart was hard to conceal. \"Young Master, you don't know, after the great war back then, although most of our people were sealed, there were still some powerful and clever kin who escaped the ultimate seal. Although they were also sealed to a certain extent, the seal was not firm and could be lifted under certain conditions. Just like Moon Lord, one of the magicians, Lord has always been looking for these kin who were under lower-level seals. Only by gathering more strength can we succeed! Youyou, let's go quickly and see, I can already feel that aura growing stronger and stronger. If we can contact these people who have broken their seals, it will definitely be a great achievement, and our side's strength will be greatly enhanced.\"\n\nYouyou popped a pastry into her mouth and said, \"Then what are we waiting for? Let's go quickly and see. I just don't know which clan they belong to, it would be best if they were from my own clan.\" The two quietly slipped out of the crowd. In a short while, they had disappeared from Talu Plaza. Before long, a dark figure rose into the air and headed towards the distance.\n\nThe sky gradually darkened. Talu Plaza once again gathered a great number of people. As the final round of the competition, the public's excitement had reached its peak. The chefs participating in the finals slowly stepped onto the rotating circular platform. Xiaotian looked around, but couldn't find Nianbing's figure anywhere. He frowned slightly, thinking to himself, \"Where did Nianbing go? He would never shy away from a fight, but the competition is about to start, how come he hasn't arrived yet? If Nianbing doesn't come, the championship will undoubtedly be his. However, Xiaotian did not wish to win the championship this way. He strongly hoped to have this final ultimate duel with Nianbing; winning by true skill was what he yearned for.\"\n\nTime passed minute by minute. Fatty Hua was also awaiting the ultimate showdown. He had deliberately delayed the competition time, but Nianbing's figure still did not appear. Left with no choice, he had to announce that Nianbing had forfeited the final match, and the competition officially began. Without Nianbing present, Xiaotian also lost interest, but with his culinary skills and the advantages he had accumulated from the previous two rounds, he still easily won the championship of the Hualong Culinary Challenge. Momo won the runner-up title with a score of eight stars in all three rounds, and another excellent chef took Nianbing's place, unexpectedly winning third place. The prize money and certificates to participate in the Chef God Competition were quickly processed and handed to the contestants. The three-day Hualong Chef Competition finally concluded, and Talu City's revelry also came to an end, albeit not a perfectly satisfactory one.\n\nEverything returned to calm. The next Hualong Culinary Competition would only be held three years later.\n\nXiaotian walked off the rotating circular platform, angrily smashing his hands together. He roared to himself, \"Nianbing, why didn't you come, you fellow? What meaning does a championship like this have for me?\"\n\n\"Don't be angry.\" Momo's soft voice sounded behind Xiaotian. Her gentle figure walked to his side, took his crystal-clear, fair hand, and said, \"There must be a reason Nianbing didn't come. Perhaps he encountered something, otherwise, he would never not come. However, even though you couldn't have an ultimate battle with him this time, there will still be opportunities in the future, after all, there's still the Chef God Competition, isn't there?\"\n\nIf Nianbing had seen such intimate actions between Momo and Xiaotian, he would definitely have been greatly surprised. Xiaotian looked at Momo, and the anger in his eyes subsided a little. \"Forget it, the competition is over anyway, saying more is meaningless. I hope to see him at the Chef God Competition. Until I defeat him, I will never consider myself the number one chef of the younger generation.\"\n\nA slight blush rose on Momo's gentle face. She gently nodded and said, \"Wherever you go, I'll be there. Let's go. Let's go say goodbye to the elders. Then we'll depart.\"\n\nXiaotian nodded, gazed at the distant sky, and sighed softly, saying, \"Nianbing, you are my greatest opponent since I debuted, and also the opponent I most long to battle. I hope nothing has happened to you. May we meet again soon.\" After saying this, he glanced at his hands, which were even more beautiful than a woman's. A series of lights flashed in his eyes, and a faint yellow battle qi flickered and disappeared.\n\nDarkness, the surroundings were completely endless darkness. Gritting his teeth, he endured the pain in his body. Nianbing was trying to sit upright. The sudden violent tremor from the ground left him and Shilade with no power to resist. Although the Eternal Sleep magic array had helped him restrict Shilade, it had also brought both their mental energies to their lowest point. Facing the sudden change, they had no chance to react at all. As they fell towards the abyss, fortunately Nianbing timely retrieved the Six-pointed Star of Divine Machine Transformations—the Xuanji Blade. Using Ice-Fire Homologous Source as a guide, and relying on short-range teleportation magic, he continuously reduced their falling speed. Only then, when they fell into the depths of the abyss, were they not smashed to death. However, the excessive consumption also pushed Nianbing's mental energy close to the brink of collapse. If not for the tenacious willpower cultivated through years of training, he would probably have already fainted.\n\nShilade also remained conscious. His current situation was much better than Nianbing's. Sitting not far from Nianbing, he was rapidly recovering his mental energy. He knew very well that only by fully recovering his mental energy a hundredfold could he possibly face this unknown. The strong evil aura from deep underground filled his heart with unease.\n\nSharp and mournful howls sounded almost incessantly. Each sound was a little stronger than the last. Taking a deep breath, Nianbing touched the not-too-deep wounds on his body. He barely managed to sit cross-legged, using a simple Water Healing Art to treat his wounds. His heart was now filled with gratitude, gratitude towards Galamandis. If not for Galamandis's hellish baptism back then, he would probably have had broken bones and torn tendons from that last fall. It was his tenacious body that saved his life, and of course, the Six-pointed Star of Divine Machine Transformations.\n\n\"Kid, are you dead yet?\" Shilade's cold voice rang out. It was pitch black in the abyss, and Nianbing could only sense Shilade's current location by his aura.\n\n\"Thanks to you, I'm still alive. Senior, how are you? You're not injured, are you? The magic array is gone, your mental energy should have recovered a bit. I hope you haven't forgotten your oath.\" In such a dangerous place, he certainly didn't want to have a powerful enemy beside him. However, he believed that as long as Shilade wasn't an idiot, he wouldn't act against him. After all, in a situation with unknown dangers like this, the rational choice was only cooperation. Lately, he had been really unlucky, encountering so many things just by participating in a competition. Not to mention the two great 'chrysanthemums'³ of the North and South, just the threat Shilade posed to him was already fatal. He had only just managed to subdue Shilade with a bit of cleverness, yet now he had encountered this situation. \"Why is it always me who gets hurt!\"\n\nShilade was silent for a moment before saying, \"My mental energy has recovered about fifty percent. Your magic array earlier caused me quite a bit of damage; it will take some time to fully recover.\"\n\nFrom Shilade's voice, Nianbing could no longer detect any hostility. He immediately breathed a sigh of relief and said, \"Senior, where are we now? Was that an earthquake just now?\"\n\nShilade snorted and said, \"What earthquake? This disaster was clearly caused by your magic array. Didn't you notice that this place is filled with a cold and evil aura? There must be something utterly evil existing here. If my guess is correct, your magic array must have activated some kind of seal placed here, which would cause landslides and earth fissures. As for the consequences, it's hard to say.\"\n\nNianbing gasped, \"Senior, do you mean I unleashed the seal of some evil magical beast? You should be most familiar with various magical beasts, is there any solution?\"\n\nShilade sighed softly and said, \"There's no solution right now, let's wait until we've recovered our strength before talking. However, what's sealed here might not necessarily be a magical beast; it could even be a person.\"\n\n\"A person? A person can be sealed underground?\" Nianbing's voice was filled with surprise. Shilade said indifferently, \"Nothing is impossible. This aura is so evil, it's probably something extremely ominous.\"\n\nNianbing's mind raced, and he quickly said, \"Senior, don't you have summoned beasts? Since it's so dangerous here, why don't you bring out your precious summoned creatures and take us out?\"\n\nShilade said, \"Do you think I don't want to? However, the evil energy here is too strong, I'm afraid my pets won't be able to bear it. We don't even know how high up the outside is from here. Once my flying pets are affected by the evil energy and drop us, do you still have spatial magic scrolls to support us so we don't fall to our deaths?\" Until now, he still hadn't realized that Nianbing was not using scrolls but actual spatial magic.\n\nHearing the words \"spatial magic\", Nianbing immediately perked up. \"That's right, I still have Mimicry that can work. With wind magic, it's not impossible to fly out. With my magic power, sustaining flight for tens of thousands of meters in height shouldn't be a problem.\"\n***\n¹ **Gege (哥哥):** A Chinese term meaning \"older brother,\" often used as a respectful or affectionate address for a slightly older male, regardless of actual family relation.\n² **Gege (哥哥):** A Chinese term meaning \"older brother,\" often used as a respectful or affectionate address for a slightly older male, regardless of actual family relation.\n³ **'Chrysanthemums' (菊花):** In this context, \"chrysanthemums\" is likely used in a colloquial or humorous way to refer to two notable or powerful, perhaps eccentric, individuals, without a literal meaning.",

    "content": "Thinking of this, he immediately relaxed a great deal. Just as he was about to recover his mental energy to leave this place earlier, that ghastly shriek rang out again. However, this time the shriek was much clearer, and it seemed to be human language: \"I'm finally out again. Sealed for thousands of years in the Place of Nether Yin, I have finally regained my freedom.\"\n\nNianbing's heart tightened. Remembering what Hilard had said, he dared not delay and immediately summoned the Dawn That Pierces the Heavens — Saintly Brilliance Blade from his Spatial Knot. In an instant, golden light swirled, and his eyes, which had adapted to the darkness, suddenly felt a sharp sting. After a moment, they returned to normal. With the golden glow from the Saintly Brilliance Blade, Nianbing saw Hilard sitting not far from him. Apart from his pale face, Hilard showed no other discomfort. He was currently staring in astonishment at the Saintly Brilliance Blade in Nianbing's hand, too surprised to speak. The last time Nianbing used the Saintly Brilliance Blade to scare away Youyou and her companion, he had sealed its light with magic, and Hilard had drunk quite a bit with Huguang that day, so he hadn't noticed it. Now, seeing this blade full of the aura of light in the darkness, it greatly astonished him.\n\nNianbing instantly became even more mysterious in Hilard's mind. Nianbing looked at his own state, and compared to Hilard, he was much more disheveled; his upper clothes had turned into shredded rags, bloodstains were clearly visible. If not for his tough body, he would probably have become minced meat long ago. Enveloped by the aura of light, both felt their spirits lift, instantly recovering some of their strength.\n\nThe Heavenly Splendor Tablet on Nianbing's chest sensed the Saintly Brilliance Blade's aura, emitting a gentle warmth that nourished Nianbing's body. His mental energy recovered significantly at this moment. He looked up and around. It was a massive canyon; even with the Saintly Brilliance Blade's illumination, he couldn't see its end. The canyon was about three zhang¹ wide, and the towering rock walls surrounding it were surprisingly black. Nianbing was surprised to discover that in this place, the Saintly Brilliance Blade's light was somewhat suppressed. It wasn't as bright as it usually was², but the aura of light still enveloped an area of one zhang square, preventing evil energy from approaching.\n\n\"Nianbing, where did you get this blade?\" Hilard looked at the Saintly Brilliance Blade in Nianbing's hand with surprise and uncertainty, constantly recalling things in his mind. In such a dense evil place, for a blade to repel evil energy by its own aura alone, this certainly wasn't an ordinary blade. How could he not be confused? Unlike the red or blue (blades), this golden long blade filled with light before his eyes was a teacher's priceless treasure³. As a mage, how could Nianbing possess so many treasures?\n\nNianbing smiled slightly and said, \"This blade was given to me by a friend. Senior, with it here, can it protect your pet and take us flying out? The evil energy here is too strong; wouldn't it be better for us to leave sooner?\" Flying out with Hilard's pet would be much easier than flying out using magic, not to mention that his magical power had not yet recovered to its optimal state.\n\nHilard nodded and said, \"Alright, we'll leave this place first.\"\n\nSlowly rising, just as he was about to chant a spell to summon his pet, that ghastly voice rang out again. The surrounding evil energy fluctuated violently. \"Since you've come, don't leave. After thousands of years of loneliness, I never expected to see humans again. Humans, I must thank you for releasing me. Cackle, cackle, cackle.\"\n\nNianbing's heart tightened, and he sincerely stepped forward a few steps to stand with Hilard. Relying on the light from the Saintly Brilliance Blade, the two saw a black figure slowly approaching them.\n\nThe black figure was tall and thin. It didn't seem to be walking on its feet, but floated steadily forward. A light flashed in Hilard's eyes, and he coldly shouted, \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Human? I stopped being human long ago. Such a hateful aura of light! Back then, mages used this aura to forcibly suppress me in this ten-thousand-zhang abyss. However, seeing that you released me, I will suck your vital essence dry and leave your corpses intact.\"\n\nAs they got closer, Nianbing and Hilard finally saw clearly: the source of the evil-filled voice was not a person, but a mass of black mist.\n\nThe dense evil mist slowly floated, and all the surrounding evil energy seemed to be converging towards it. The entire mass of mist stretched outwards with countless misty tentacles, looking exceptionally strange.\n\nHilard, experienced and knowledgeable, couldn't help but gasp at the sight before him. \"Nether-Witch. Are you a Nether-Witch?\"\n\n\"Cackle, cackle, cackle! To be able to discern my identity, that's impressive! It seems you humans haven't completely forgotten us. The auras of you two are quite good, possessing a strong magical essence. As long as I absorb your vital essence, I can make another breakthrough, perhaps even reaching the Great Nether-Witch realm. I will destroy all humanity, then go find those hateful bastards and settle accounts!\"\n\nUpon hearing Hilard utter the words \"Nether-Witch,\" Nianbing's heart immediately grew cold. He had also heard of the existence of Nether-Witches. He had read about them in an ancient book on the fourth floor of the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild. A Nether-Witch was a mutated form of a Dark Mage, and one of the two most difficult forms of Dark Mage to cultivate. Dark Mages found it very difficult to improve their strength after reaching the Archmage realm, because the backlash⁴ from dark magic was extremely intense. Although the power of dark magic was the greatest among all magic systems, its drawback was that the caster would be devoured by darkness. Therefore, Dark Mages who reached the Archmage realm had only three choices: one was to cease cultivating dark magic and diligently use various magical items to strengthen their physical bodies. Once their bodies reached a certain level, they could resume cultivation. This method could be considered the orthodox path for Dark Mage cultivation, but it was extremely difficult to practice. A single mistake could lead to immediate destruction by the powerful backlash.\n\nDark Mages cultivated much faster in the early stages compared to other systems, but upon reaching the Archmage realm, they would stagnate due to the difficulty of further progress.\n\nHowever, there were also two forbidden cultivation methods in the dark magic world, one of which was to cultivate into a Nether-Witch.\n\nA Nether-Witch referred to a Dark Archmage who, through special methods, completely abandoned their body, sacrificing their flesh and blood in exchange for powerful dark magical power. Though their bodies perish⁵, their souls endure. Not only would their magical power greatly increase, but they would also no longer fear any physical attacks.\n\nHowever, the cultivation method for a Nether-Witch⁶ was extremely arduous, with success rates of one in a thousand. The ultimate fate for most Dark Archmages who chose the Nether-Witch cultivation method was the destruction of their fleshly body⁷ and the dispersion of their soul along with it.\n\nBut precisely because Nether-Witch cultivation was extremely difficult, once successful, they would immediately enter the realm of a Dark Grand Mage. They would be much more powerful than Grand Mages of other systems, with nearly infinite dark magical power coupled with a soul body that feared no physical attacks, making them a nightmare for powerful individuals. Continued cultivation for a Nether-Witch required absorbing the vital essence of other living beings; only then could they continuously enhance their own evil energy. The book Nianbing read stated that once a Nether-Witch appeared, it became a public enemy of all humanity. Every appearance of a Nether-Witch brought great disaster to humanity. Defeating them required countless sacrifices.\n\nAt this moment, Nianbing finally understood why this Nether-Witch said it had been sealed for thousands of years. How could an ordinary human survive for such a long time?\n\nBut a Nether-Witch was different; they possessed endless life. Unless destroyed, they would continue to exist until the day they were annihilated. Those who cultivated into Nether-Witches were the most evil existences; even the dark magic world itself would not tolerate their presence. After all, Nether-Witches were too powerful. Moreover, the existence of Nether-Witches posed the greatest threat to other dark practitioners who also cultivated dark magic, because Dark Mages were the best nourishment for Nether-Witches.\n\nAs for the third cultivation method for Dark Mage advancement, that was the legendary Lich. A Lich was the ultimate dark magic practitioner. Although a Nether-Witch could also advance to the Divine Descendant realm through continuous cultivation, they were unable to unleash the most powerful dark magic forbidden spells due to lacking a physical body. However, a Lich was different; they possessed their own body, and could be considered an advancement of a Dark Grand Mage. Only a Dark Grand Mage could cultivate into the strongest Nether-Witch⁸. That was the true powerful being of the dark realm. Upon reaching the Lich realm, there was no distinction between good and evil. With their formidable dark magic, even light could not become their bane. However, Liches only existed in legends. After all, cultivating into a Lich was much more difficult than cultivating into a Divine Descendant.\n\nA Lich that had survived for thousands of years, what a powerful existence that would be⁹! Even if it had been sealed all this time, its strength was likely incomparable to a Dark Grand Mage. Not to mention that both of them were currently greatly weakened; even in their perfect state, it would probably be difficult to contend with the Nether-Witch before them. They had truly run into a steel plate¹⁰. A bitter smile appeared on Nianbing's face. He subconsciously glanced at Hilard beside him and whispered, \"I'll try my best to hold him off. You summon a dragon. Perhaps only a giant dragon can contend with him.\"\n\nHilard smiled bitterly. \"I'd like to summon one too, but Karodelis went to their Dragon King Assembly. We don't know when it will return¹¹; my mental energy isn't enough right now, so I can't contact it at all. Now we'll just have to fight. I hope the blade in your hand has more suppressive power against darkness.\"\n\nIf he were in his full state and Karodelis were by his side, Hilard would certainly have the confidence to fight the Lich before them. But in their current situation, he had no celebratory thoughts. Regret was meaningless now. Covertly, he seized every second to accumulate his mental energy.\n\nThe Nether-Witch had endured so many years of loneliness. Having finally seen humans, it was not in a hurry to kill Nianbing and Hilard. In its eyes, these two humans were its food, with no possibility of escape. A light cackle sounded again. \"Which of you two broke the seal? The method of destruction was quite good! You must have used Divine Forbidden Magic of some kind. Unfortunately, the energy was a bit weak, so it took my power combined with yours to destroy this seal that trapped me for many years. Tell me, what method did you use?\"\n\nNianbing's heart stirred. He understood that both he and Hilard needed time to recover their magical power. Every bit of strength recovered would increase their chances of survival. A slight smile appeared on his face. \"Esteemed Mr. Nether-Witch, I was the one who broke that seal. I merely drew a magic array unintentionally, and I didn't expect to release you. Are you the only one in this abyss? Your strength is truly formidable! I have never felt such a dense evil aura before.\"\n\nThe Nether-Witch seemed quite pleased to hear Nianbing's praise. \"There wasn't just me here originally, kid. Don't use the word 'human' to describe me. I told you, I stopped being human long ago. Back then, when the eight of us ran rampant across the continent, it was 'kill anyone who blocks, kill gods who block¹².' Damn it, later those bastards who called themselves gods imposed¹³ those hateful Divine Prohibitions, generating enormous energy by self-destructing. I was originally close to reaching the Lich realm, but their Divine Prohibitions forcibly destroyed me. To survive, I had to risk transforming into a Nether-Witch. That's how I survived. Of the eight of us, only I and the Black Martial Emperor survived, but we were sealed in this place. The powerful evil energy you feel is what those six idiots left behind after they died. I alone don't have that much evil energy. It's a pity I can't absorb vital essence; otherwise, I would have transformed this evil aura into myself¹⁴ long ago. If I succeed, hmph hmph, I can become the first person to cultivate from a Nether-Witch into a Witch God. At that time, I could even reconstruct my body.\"\n\nHearing him say this, Nianbing and Hilard's hearts immediately sank. A Dark Mage close to the Lich realm transforming into a Nether-Witch, how powerful would that be! In other words, he had already surpassed the realm of a Dark Grand Mage before transforming into a Nether-Witch. Perhaps, even the Ice Snow Goddess Transcendent, the only Divine Descendant on the continent now, might not be its match.\n\nThe Nether-Witch's black mist rippled slightly. \"Kid, put away that worthless blade of yours. Damn it, although light has no effect on me now, this aura is still truly annoying¹⁵.\"\n\nNianbing said, \"Esteemed Mr. Nether-Witch, if I put away the blade, I won't be able to see your magnificent form. Anyway, it can't harm you, so let me hold it, please.\" He was joking, of course; putting away the Saintly Brilliance Blade would only lead to a faster death. With the Saintly Brilliance Blade's aura of light present, Nianbing and Hilard at least felt somewhat safer.\n\nThe Nether-Witch snorted. \"What, do you think I'm afraid of this blade? Fine, let you see¹⁶ my strength.\"\n---\n¹ A *zhang* is a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.3 meters or 11 feet.\n² The original text contained a likely typo \"入學\" (entering school/admission); it has been translated as \"as it usually was\" to reflect the probable intended meaning of \"as before\" or \"as usual.\"\n³ The original text for this sentence (\"否認是紅色、藍色不是眼前這柄充滿光明氣息的金色長刀，教師無價之寶\") is garbled and possibly contains typos. The translation reflects a plausible interpretation that Hilard is comparing this unique golden blade to other types of valuable magic items (perhaps typically red or blue) that he knows of.

    "content": "As soon as he finished speaking, a tentacle formed from black mist shot out like lightning towards Nian Bing. Nian Bing had no time to react, feeling as if his body had plunged into an ice cellar, his blood seemingly freezing solid at that moment. The Holy Radiance Blade in his hand had already been coiled by the black tentacle. Just as the Nether Lich had said, the Holy Radiance Blade's golden light had not the slightest power to harm its tentacles.\n\nThe Nether Lich brought the Holy Radiance Blade towards its mass of black mist. The mist suddenly swelled, completely engulfing the Holy Radiance Blade. The golden light vanished, and the surroundings plunged into darkness once more. \"See? Light *finally* has an effect on me. What I, Safen, want to do, no one can stop now. Not speaking for thousands of years, having so much to say is truly comfortable! Ah-----\" The triumphant Nether Lich Safen suddenly let out a miserable shriek. Golden light instantly burst forth from within the black mist, radiant golden beams shooting out, illuminating this ten-thousand-foot abyss brightly. The golden light gradually transformed into sacred white, and shrill roars continuously echoed. The black mist, under the effect of the white light, actually began to melt.\n\n\"Bastard, it's actually that Holy Master's Dawn Blade. Damn it, why am I so unlucky?\" Safen's voice gradually weakened, but the white light grew increasingly intense. The Holy Radiance Blade floated in mid-air, appearing utterly sacred. The pure white light emanating from the blade made Nian Bing and Shirade feel as if they were bathing in a spring breeze. The two exchanged surprised glances, both reading joy in the other's eyes. This was truly a reprieve from certain death! Who would have thought the Holy Radiance Blade could severely wound the Lich before them?\n\nThe Nether Lich Safen seemed to still be resisting, his thick, liquid-like black mist churning ceaselessly. At this moment, Shirade moved. His eyes gradually turned white, and he recited loudly: \"Gate of Spirit! Open with my heart, transcend the limits of time and space, unleash infinite waves! Mental Wave.\" Every word he uttered resonated in Nian Bing's heart like the solemn tolling of a morning bell and evening drum. With each word, the mass of black mist violently fluctuated. Its resistance to the white light released from the Holy Radiance Blade would also weaken a fraction. When the final four words, \"Mental Wave,\" were spoken, Nian Bing clearly felt an incomparably vast mental power violently oscillating in the air, like sharp blades dissecting the Nether Lich's mass of black mist.\n\nNian Bing secretly congratulated himself. Although he could already use five types of mimetic magic, he probably had no opportunity to employ it against such monstrous mental magic as Shirade's. No wonder Shirade had been willing to let him draw the magic array earlier. With such potent mental magic, how could he lack confidence? The most terrifying aspect of mental magic was its immunity to interference from any other energy. Unless the opponent's mental power surpassed the caster's, it was exceedingly difficult to resist. This was also why Shirade held such a high position within Arc Light. A powerful Dragon Summoner, who also possessed formidable magic that commanded a certain fear from anyone, his strength, though still not comparable to the God Descender or the Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess, probably meant that apart from her, few mages on the continent could contend with Shirade.\n\nUnder the onslaught of mental magic, the Nether Lich Safen's resistance immediately weakened significantly, and his shrill screams also became much fainter. Even Nian Bing hadn't expected that this divine blade, once wielded by the Holy Master, would possess such immense power. Actually, when Galamandis had recounted the Holy Master's story to him back then, it was just a rough outline. In those days, after the Holy Master gained renown on the Yang Guang Continent, he relied on the Dawn Blade to right all injustices in the world. The blade was exceptional, and the man was even more so. The Holy Master's righteous aura had imperceptibly been absorbed by the blade. This was no longer just simple light energy, but the Holy Master's Sacred Energy. The Nether Lich was inherently the most evil practitioner in the world. Carelessly, he drew the sacred blade into his body, intending to utterly shatter it, but this thoroughly activated the sacred energy within the blade. All positive energies completely erupted. Let alone Safen, even a powerful Lich, if they were to absorb this blade, the outcome would certainly not be any better.\n\nSafen's resistance grew weaker and weaker, and the black currents of energy scattered. Finally, when the shrill screams ceased, everything returned to peace. The sacred blade descended from mid-air and, under its own gravity, plunged into the ground. Over eighty percent of the evil aura within the entire abyss was swept away by the Holy Radiance Blade's sacred energy, leaving only faint remnants of evil lingering in the distance, yet it dared not approach the Holy Radiance Blade. The pure white light of the Holy Radiance Blade did not vanish; instead, it became even more sacred, rendering the entire blade a jade-like white.\n\nNian Bing let out a long breath. Just as he was about to retrieve this precious blade that had saved him and Shirade, something else occurred. A layer of hazy, sacred energy emanated from the Holy Radiance Stone on the hilt, coalescing into a mass in the air, gradually forming a blurry human figure. Nian Bing was startled, his raised foot instinctively dropping. Shirade was equally surprised, subconsciously preparing to attack with mental magic.\n\nA low and ethereal voice slowly rang out, \"I never expected, truly never expected, that the mental imprint I left within the blade would be activated. Brave human, you did not flinch even when facing an enemy like the Nether Lich. It seems humans now are much stronger than before.\" Although the blurry human figure's appearance was indistinct, its tall stature imposed immense pressure on Nian Bing and Shirade, like a towering mountain.\n\nNian Bing and Shirade exchanged glances, then Nian Bing tentatively asked, \"Are you the Holy Master? How are you...\"\n\nThe white light rippled slightly and said, \"Indeed, I am the Holy Master of whom the Nether Lich spoke. This Dawn Blade accompanied me for many years, slaying countless great villains and evils. Young man, are you its current master? You truly are worthy of this blade. Back then, when your blood seeped into the blade, I sensed it from afar. Although your aura contains many impurities, your heart is kind. Although your path is not the same as mine, one day, you will also become like me. However, before that, you must guard your heart and not let hatred blind your eyes. I can sense your body; your physical structure is already very different from ordinary humans. It can be said that you are not a simple human. The potential you possess surprises even me. Develop your potential well. Well, this mental imprint of mine, once activated, can only last for a short time. I will not appear again in the future. This Holy Radiance Blade will also fully become your weapon. Use it well, and do not let its brilliance be tarnished. I hope one day, when you reach a realm like ours, we can meet again. Come with me. There is something here that you need. While my aura has not completely dissipated, I will guide you to subdue it. With it, your strength will greatly increase.\" As soon as he finished speaking, the white light figure extended a hand-shaped beam of light, grasped the Holy Radiance Blade, and slowly floated deeper into the ten-thousand-foot abyss. Nian Bing and Shirade quickly followed. The white light floated slowly; their pace was just right to keep up.\n\nAs they walked, Nian Bing couldn't help but ask, \"Holy Master, did you know that Nether Lich from earlier? He said he was sealed here for thousands of years, and that there were eight dark powerhouses like him back then.\"\n\nThe Holy Master said calmly, \"Indeed. This Nether Lich Safen is from my era. Back then, there were eight of them in total. Four chose to cultivate as Liches, but none succeeded. The other four were Dark Warriors, wreaking havoc with their tyrannical dark battle qi. These eight individuals once brought immense disaster to humanity. Wherever they passed, no grass grew. When they were running rampant, it was just when I first debuted. At that time, I was not their match. However, their malevolent arrogance was truly too extreme; the lives slaughtered by their subordinates were countless. One time, I encountered them and fought a desperate battle. Just as I was about to be killed by them, the light of a god finally enveloped the land. These eight most evil beings in the darkness had already approached the power of gods. To eliminate them, a god exhausted their life to unleash a powerful restriction. In the end, only Safen and the Dark Warrior Emperor survived. For generations, he was the strongest among these eight. Safen and the other four Dark Mages, unable to advance to Liches at the last moment, chose to switch to cultivating as Nether Witches. With their powerful dark abilities, transforming into Nether Liches had a high success rate, but even so, only Safen survived. Later, the power of the divine restriction weakened, no longer enough to kill Safen and the Dark Warrior Emperor. So, they were sealed here. Without the supply of blood essence, a Nether Lich would gradually die. But unexpectedly, Safen used the evil energy of his deceased comrades and a dark treasure to forcibly suppress his dark aura from dissipating, thus holding on until today. The Dark Warrior Emperor was, after all, human, and had died long ago. Originally, in another hundred years, Safen would have nearly succumbed, living without blood essence. But you released his seal. Fortunately, you had my blade with you, and the Nether Lich Safen carelessly absorbed the blade into his body. This is how he was destroyed by a strange coincidence. Child, do you know? You nearly caused a catastrophe for humanity! After I take you to retrieve that item and completely absorb the remaining evil aura here, it will prevent harm to the human world.\"\n\nCold sweat broke out on Nian Bing's back. He nodded repeatedly and said, \"This time it was all my oversight. I never expected that magic array to cause such a huge fluctuation.\"\n\nThe Holy Master sighed and said, \"Even we didn't expect the original key magic array to still be recorded on the Yang Guang Continent. Nian Bing, didn't you feel that that magic array had no special effects? Not only was it extremely complex to draw, requiring immense mental energy, but its effect wasn't particularly good, and it would even backfire.\"\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile and said, \"When I first researched this magic array, it was because of its strange and complex structure, and it had lost its most crucial activation part, so I studied it out of curiosity. Later, I discovered that using Ice and Fire Homologous could activate this magic array. Today, when facing Senior Shirade, this magic array was able to exert great effectiveness. I never expected that a Nether Lich would be sealed here.\"\n\nThe Holy Master said calmly, \"What's past is past. In the future, you must think clearly before doing anything, lest you regret it. You must remember my words: do not let hatred blind your eyes.\"\n\nNian Bing's body trembled. He retorted, \"But, can I not avenge my hatred? My parents cannot have died in vain.\"\n\nThe Holy Master sighed and said, \"It is not appropriate for me to get too involved in the affairs of the Yang Guang Continent. You must manage yourself. This time, with my mental imprint activated, I see that the Yang Guang Continent has entered a rare period of peace. As long as there are no more disasters, all will be well.\" The two, accompanied by \"the blade,\" gradually walked deeper into the darkness. The place where Nian Bing and Shirade had originally been became desolate once more.\n\nA faint wisp of black energy condensed, forming a small mass of black mist. The Nether Lich Safen's low voice was filled with anger: \"Bastard, Holy Master, you bastard, you actually destroyed so much of my cultivation! Fortunately, after so many years, I mastered the ability of the Dark Nether Clone; otherwise, you truly would have killed me. Just you wait. Once I recover my magical power, I will make you pay dearly.\" Safen was not dead. Although his current power was less than one percent of his peak, he firmly believed that with enough blood essence, it wouldn't take long for him to recover his cultivation. After all, his foundation as a Nether Lich remained. Sensing that eighty percent of the surrounding evil aura had dissipated, Safen knew he had to quickly leave this place; recovering his abilities was paramount.\n\nJust as Safen was about to float away, a giant figure descended from the air. A soft \"Hmm?\" sounded, the huge wings retracted, and a petite figure leaped onto the ground. \"Finally, we're at the bottom. We flew so far, I'm so tired. Brother Pingchao, your back is really hard; next time, you should prepare a cushion.\" Seeing that more people had arrived, Safen immediately prostrated himself on the ground, not daring to make a sound. The current him was not as powerful as before. This vampire's aura was not weak; it was not something he could deal with now.\n\nPingchao inwardly gave a wry smile. He was the one who had flown hundreds of kilometers, and she, comfortably sitting on his back, actually complained about being tired. It was truly outrageous. But Youyou was his young master after all, what could he say? He looked around and said with doubt, \"Why is the dark aura here so much weaker? What I sensed in Talu City was much stronger than now. No, something must have happened here. By my soul, I summon you, open, my Dark Eye.\"\n\nUpon hearing Pingchao's incantation, Safen couldn't help but inwardly cry out \"This isn't good,\" but he was now extremely weak. The little energy he had managed to accumulate was no longer enough to support him in stealth or a normal escape. A faint green light swept out in a fan shape, and Pingchao's first sensation was the presence of the Nether Lich Safen.",

    "content": "Even with Pingchao's nerves of steel, the moment Safen appeared, he couldn't help but be greatly startled, exclaiming loudly, \"Nether Witch!\" With a flash, he immediately blocked Youyou, simultaneously raising his abilities to their limit, his blood-red eyes radiating a terrifying ferocity.\n\nYouyou was startled at first, then curiously poked her head out from under Pingchao's armpit, looking at the Nether Witch revealed in the green light of the Eye of Darkness. She giggled, saying, \"What a cute little Nether Witch! Big Brother Pingchao, are you sure he's a Nether Witch? Daddy said Nether Witches are extremely powerful Darkness Practitioners, but he doesn't look strong at all.\"\n\nPingchao's brows slightly furrowed. While continuously gathering his Darkness Power, he observed the Nether Witch before him. At this moment, Safen was inwardly wailing in distress. He knew he couldn't run now, because with his current abilities, he couldn't run fast at all. If he ran, the other party would immediately realize his weakness, and as fellow Darkness Practitioners, how could they let him go? Helpless, he could only feign a cold voice, saying, \"Indeed, I am the great Nether Witch. You two youngsters, you've trespassed into my domain without permission. Are you not afraid of being destroyed?\"\n\nPingchao said, \"Senior Nether Witch, we sensed your aura earlier, which is why we hurried over. My master hopes to unite all dark forces to establish a grand enterprise. May I ask if you would be willing to join us?\" As he spoke, he secretly released a dark aura, probing towards Safen the Nether Witch. He also sensed the issue Youyou had mentioned. How powerful a being a Nether Witch was! Yet, this small wisp of black mist before him gave him no sense of oppression at all. This was completely illogical. However, the black mist spoke in a human voice, and combined with its aura full of death and evil, it was clearly a true Nether Witch. For a moment, Pingchao was also somewhat confused, secretly discerning Safen's strength.\n\nSafen snorted coldly, saying, \"I have no interest in alliances. As a powerful Nether Witch, I don't need to ally with anyone. For the sake of our shared origin, leave. Otherwise, I won't be polite.\"\n\nYouyou giggled. She slipped out from behind Pingchao. \"Not polite? How won't you be polite? You look so weak, like a little child. Oh, great dark aura! Please transform into an infinite demonic barrier, envelop everything before me, and reveal the true world, Eye of Truth!\" The light in Youyou's beautiful black eyes flared, rippling outwards. A green light flashed in her lovely gaze, and the next moment, she had observed everything around them. Although the dark aura here wasn't weak, it was far from as strong as Pingchao had previously stated. And this small wisp of black mist before her was pitifully weak, so much so that even her own dark demonic energy could easily surpass it. \"Is there such a weak Nether Witch? This is my first time seeing one. Daddy said my precious Lil' Green needs a soul to become a more powerful magic artifact. Since you're a little Nether Witch, then be the soul for my Lil' Green. Lil' Green, go!\" Green light suddenly flared. The green skull that had once been used to deal with Mao Mao suddenly appeared before Youyou, and eerie green flames spewed from its eyes, transforming into streams of green fiery threads that wrapped around Safen the Nether Witch.\n\nAt this moment, Safen knew that any further intimidation was useless. In utter desperation, he could only gather his last bit of demonic energy and rapidly escape into the air. The black mist condensed into a small black-purple orb, shooting towards the darkness above like a skipping star-pellet. Youyou was still a bit too inexperienced after all; she couldn't fully unleash the power of her magic artifact. Safen suddenly accelerated, instantly bursting out from the threads formed by the green flames. However, Safen had now lost his composure. Having suddenly revealed his cowardice, how could those of the same dark alignment let him go?\n\n\"Go back.\" A cold voice sounded above Safen. If vampires had a few most proficient skills, speed was definitely one of them. A Nether Witch Safen at his peak could naturally deal with Pingchao with ease, but now, he was by no means Pingchao's match. A massive dark aura pressed down like a black cloud. Safen felt his entire body tighten, as if he had crashed into a quagmire, unable to break free. And at this moment, Youyou had already commanded her green fiery threads to wrap around him, securely binding Safen with Pingchao's help.\n\nSafen was utterly depressed! He never expected that after being sealed for thousands of years, having finally endured until he escaped his suffering, he would encounter such a situation. Before he could think any further, the dark-purple spherical energy that his body had transformed into was sucked into the large mouth of the skull before Youyou by the green fiery threads. Youyou changed several hand gestures in succession, and the skull flared with green light, completely sealing off the external aura from the inside. Although on the surface Youyou was just a cute little girl who sometimes acted impulsively based on her whims, the various dark magic she had cultivated with her father since childhood were extremely pure, and she completely knew what to do in any given situation.\n\nRetrieving the green skull, Youyou looked at Pingchao the vampire, who had landed beside her, and asked, \"Big Brother Pingchao, do you think this little ball is really a Nether Witch?\"\n\nPingchao nodded, saying, \"Definitely. When I came into contact with his true form just now, I found that although his current dark energy is extremely weak, he is absolutely a Nether Witch. His spiritual aura is very strong, but I don't know why he suffered such immense trauma, which is why he is so weak. Youyou, this time you've gained a priceless treasure. With a Nether Witch as a soul, it will undoubtedly create an extremely powerful magic artifact. However, you'd best not use Lil' Green anymore for now. I'm afraid you won't be able to control the Nether Witch inside, and he might escape. Let's go quickly. After we return, let Master help you perfect this magic artifact. Nether Witches are rare in this world; those who choose to cultivate as Nether Witches and succeed are pitifully few. I think perhaps Master will know this Nether Witch's origin. With Master's Nine Nether Demonic Flame, he will surely be able to ascertain everything about this Nether Witch. With him, your strength, little Miss Youyou, will undoubtedly grow by leaps and bounds. Unfortunately, I don't know what happened here; the originally dense dark aura has become much thinner. Otherwise, it would have been a very suitable place for you to cultivate. Let's go.\" After speaking, Pingchao lowered his body and transformed back into a gigantic bat.\n\nYouyou jumped onto Pingchao's back. \"Big Brother Pingchao, you have to fly faster! I like the feeling of speed. Oh, when we get back, I'll definitely tell Daddy to help you get promoted to Count soon, so you can fly even faster.\" Poor Safen, a Nether Witch of his generation, had thus become the soul of Youyou's magic artifact, unable to realize his dreams ever again. He could only lament within the green skull.\n\nYouyou and Pingchao quickly departed from this vast Abyss of Darkness. Meanwhile, Nianbing and Shilard, led by the Holy Blade, were entering the deepest part of the Abyss of Darkness.\n\nThe Abyss of Darkness was exceptionally clear under the illumination of the Holy Blade. There was no path at all; the intricate and complex terrain was extremely difficult to traverse. Nianbing cast a Fourth-Tier Wind Magic: Levitation spell on both himself and Shilard, which made their progress not difficult. Shilard was greatly astonished when he saw Nianbing actually use Wind Magic, but at that moment, he didn't question Nianbing. Although Fourth-Tier Levitation was not a powerful spell, it was a symbol of a Wind Mage advancing from intermediate to advanced level. While Levitation could not grant flight and only allowed one to float within a zhang (approximately 3.3 meters) off the ground, it was a very practical spell that consumed very little magic power, most suitable for use in complex terrain, and could achieve excellent results.\n\n\"We're here.\" The Holy Blade, which had been floating ahead, slowly came to a halt. Nianbing looked forward through the Holy Blade's illumination and found that they had reached the end of the abyss. Ahead was a ten-thousand-foot-high cliff soaring into the darkness. At the very bottom of the stone wall lay a strange skeleton. It was strange because its bone structure was pure black, and the black bones looked exceptionally eerie. Leaning against the stone wall behind it, its bony hands tightly clutched a long blade. This long blade was different from the Holy Radiance Blade, as it was not wide or thick; the blade itself, including its sheath, was only an inch wide, yet its length surpassed that of Holy Radiance. If not for the extremely strong light from the Holy Radiance Blade, this entirely black blade would be impossible to spot in the darkness. Under the Holy Radiance Blade's light, the slender black blade was actually trembling slightly, not with fear, but rather as if in challenge, seemingly excited as if it had met a formidable opponent. A small gemstone was inlaid at the end of the hilt. The gemstone was purple and triangular, with a sharp tail protruding from behind the hilt, appearing to be one of the blade's own attack methods. The dark-purple gemstone didn't shine; instead, a faint black airflow enveloped it, obscuring the gem's reflected luster.\n\n\"Ah, the Black Martial Emperor could be said to be the pinnacle of martial artists in the dark world, yet he died here like this. Speaking of it, it's nothing short of a tragedy.\" The Holy Master's tone held a hint of lament, yet within that lament, there was a touch of respect. A formidable opponent capable of earning his respect made Nianbing and Shilard look at him with new eyes. This Black Martial Emperor must have led a legendary life.\n\n\"The Black Martial Emperor, in our era, was a pinnacle that no dark warrior could surpass, hence the title 'Martial Emperor'. After I first started out, I fought him three times. The first time, he used one saber and nearly killed me. The second time, it was two sabers, and the third time, three sabers. After he defeated me the third time, he told me that he could have easily killed me, but he felt I had great potential and could gradually improve to become his sparring partner for testing his blade, which is why he spared my life. To catch up to the Black Martial Emperor's strength, I continuously worked hard, but even by the last time I saw him, I still couldn't withstand a hundred blows from him. Among the Black Martial Emperor and his eight companions, the most cunning was the Nether Witch Safen we just saw. But the one whose strength truly contended with gods, able to make gods sacrifice themselves in a Divine Explosion to eliminate him, was the Black Martial Emperor. At that time, over seventy percent of the immense power generated by the Divine Explosion was aimed at the Black Martial Emperor, yet he still survived, showing just how powerful he was. In truth, the Black Martial Emperor couldn't be considered truly evil; he was merely a martial arts fanatic. To cultivate higher-level martial techniques, he delved into darkness. When he finally faced the Divine Prohibition, he had already surpassed what is now called the Divine Master realm on the continent, reaching another level, a level that even we gods had to fear. That's why we had no choice but to destroy him with a Divine Explosion. Otherwise, he would eventually challenge the domain of the gods.\"\n\nThe Holy Master's respect in his tone became increasingly apparent. The light on the Holy Radiance Blade was noticeably dimmer than before. \"Do you see the blade in the Black Martial Emperor's hand? That is the Demon Devouring Blade, reputed to be the third magic artifact of the dark realm. In the Black Martial Emperor's hands, this blade was an almost invincible existence. The three blows I mentioned earlier from my first three clashes with the Black Martial Emperor were all struck with the blade still in its sheath. Throughout his life, the Black Martial Emperor's heart held only the blade. This blade had completely merged with his essence, qi, and spirit. In the later stages of his cultivation, the Black Martial Emperor used his soul as the blade, his entire being completely fused with this Demon Devouring Blade—that was power capable of splitting heaven and earth! Although my Dawn Blade also reached the Divine Artifact realm later due to the enhancement of holy power, it couldn't compare to this Demon Devouring Blade. However, with the Holy Radiance Stone inlaid earlier, it shouldn't be much worse than the Demon Devouring Blade. Nianbing, you are fortunate; each of your blades has an extraordinary origin and possesses powerful energy. In fact, during your cultivation, you don't need to pursue other cultivation methods. As long as you can fully unleash the power of these few blades, then you will already be a powerful mage. Cultivating mimetic magic with human power, even I am seeing for the first time. Since that is the case, I shall fulfill your wish. The Black Martial Emperor's Demon Devouring Blade can completely fill your gap in the darkness attribute. However, although the Black Martial Emperor is dead, gaining the Demon Devouring Blade's recognition will not be easy. You must try at the cost of your flesh and blood. If you fail, you will at least become crippled. Are you willing to try?\"\n\nNianbing fell silent. No one wishes to become crippled, yet after listening to the Holy Master's explanation of the Black Martial Emperor, it was absolutely impossible for him not to be tempted by this slender Demon Devouring Blade. From the day he began cultivating mimetic magic, Nianbing knew how difficult it would be to gather all seven Divine Blades. Especially magic blades with darkness and spatial attributes; let alone top-tier ones, even ordinary ones were extremely precious and incredibly rare to find. Darkness-attribute magic items, in particular, were inherently taboo on the continent, not to mention top-tier ones. Facing the Demon Devouring Blade now was an excellent opportunity. If he could possess it, the only magic blade he would lack would be the earth-attribute one.",

    "content": "Darkness was mysterious to Nian Bing. At the same time, it was the domain he most wished to explore.\n\nShilard was watching Nian Bing. Although he detested dark aura the most, he had unwavering faith in the Holy Master's words. Mimicry Magic. What was that? Could Nian Bing cast magic of all elements? Would he want this blade, considering the possibility of paying the price of disability? If it were him, how would he choose? He felt lost. Shilard also understood how difficult this choice was.\n\nAfter a long moment, Nian Bing slowly raised his head. His gaze had already become peaceful. A soft glow emanated from his clear gaze, without any discernible fluctuations. He calmly said to the Holy Master, \"I am willing to try.\"\n\nOnly five simple words, but how much courage they represented! Nian Bing's composure deeply shocked Shilard's heart. It made him gain a new understanding of the young man before him. He suddenly had a feeling that when it came to judging people, he seemed to be inferior to his daughter. The young man before him was indeed outstanding, and so exceptionally so, not just because of his peculiar magic, but even more so because of his character. Shilard gazed deeply at Nian Bing. His gaze had already softened.\n\nIn fact, ever since he and Nian Bing fell into the abyss, he had no longer harbored any ill will towards Nian Bing. Nian Bing didn't say, but Shilard knew very well how the wounds on Nian Bing's body came to be. When they fell into the abyss from the crevice, both their spiritual powers were very weak, especially his own. His spirit magic couldn't be wielded at all due to his spiritual power being restricted, and he couldn't even summon his pet. Under such circumstances, Shilard had gently closed his eyes, waiting for death. But he didn't die. It was Nian Bing who grabbed his arm in mid-air. Nian Bing's spiritual power was also weak. While using space magic to slow their descent, their falling speed was still getting faster and faster. For survival, Nian Bing pulled Shilard as close as possible to the abyss's stone wall. Every time he used space magic, he would kick the stone wall with all his might, combining it with space magic to reduce their falling speed. At that time, Nian Bing continuously used his body to shield Shilard. All the wounds on his body were caused by the stone wall, while Shilard was completely unharmed. When they landed on the ground, Shilard was overwhelmed with emotions. Although he tried his best to maintain outward calm, his heart was already surging like a tempest. When Netherworld Mage Safen appeared, Shilard had already secretly decided that even if he sacrificed his own life, he would save Nian Bing and repay this favor. However, in the end, it was Nian Bing's blade that saved them. At this moment, in order to gain greater power, Nian Bing resolutely chose to attempt it. This kind of courage was something Shilard admitted he could not compare to.\n\nThe Holy Master's voice became even more benevolent, \"Nian Bing, are you truly certain? There's no medicine for regret in this world. Even on the Divine Continent, it's the same. I hope you understand.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded firmly and said, \"I am willing to try. How can one gain without paying a price? I understand this principle, Holy Master. Please teach me what to do.\"\n\nThe sacred white light on the Sacred Radiance Blade dimmed a little more than before. The Holy Master said, \"I have brought you here, and I have told you the potential price you might pay. As for what exactly to do, that's up to you. To gain the Demon Devouring Blade's recognition is equivalent to gaining the Black Martial Emperor's recognition. This requires your resolve. I believe you will succeed.\"\n\nNian Bing was slightly taken aback. Was he supposed to figure it out himself? A look of confusion flashed in his eyes. He nodded and walked with firm steps to the Black Martial Emperor's remains. Without needing to test or reach out to touch, Nian Bing could clearly feel the steel-like sensation emanating from the Black Martial Emperor's black skeleton. To cultivate martial arts to such an extent, no wonder even the Holy Master spoke so highly of him.\n\nA faint smile appeared on Nian Bing's face. He knelt on one knee, firmly extended his right hand, and gripped the middle section of the Demon Devouring Blade. The black scabbard was so chilling. It was a coldness completely different from that of the Morning Dew Blade. In an instant, Nian Bing's body trembled violently, and various illusions continuously appeared in his mind. The illusions weren't clear, but Nian Bing seemed to see everything that had happened in the Black Martial Emperor's life, each scene filled with a sense of power. In the Black Martial Emperor's hands, this slender blade possessed an imposing aura that permeated heaven and earth. Vaguely, Nian Bing felt as if the Black Martial Emperor hadn't died. The cold dark aura was so pure, yet within that pure darkness lurked an evil many times more powerful than what the Sacred Radiance Blade had previously dispersed. The chilling evil force continuously stimulated Nian Bing's body, as if trying to induce something. The Heavenly Brilliance Plate emitted a gentle aura. Under its guidance, the Ice and Fire Conjoined power fully unleashed, merging into a red and blue intertwined orb of light. Although it couldn't repel the vast evil aura, it could guard his true self, working with the Heavenly Brilliance Plate to prevent his mind from being invaded by evil.\n\nFrom the outside, Shilard saw a different scene. Nian Bing, kneeling on one knee, had his body enveloped in red and blue light, with an outer layer of sacred white aura. Yet the Demon Devouring Blade was filled with a sense of darkness. Black vapor covered the Black Martial Emperor's skeletal remains. It seemed to be an exchange of energy, yet also a struggle between them. Shilard knew that at this moment, no one could help Nian Bing; only he himself could. Unconsciously, Shilard had clenched his fists. He suddenly realized how tall and great this young man, who repaid evil with good, had become in his heart.\n\nNian Bing didn't know how much time had passed. In the final moment, all the illusions completely merged. All he saw was the blade, the Demon Devouring Blade. That was a supremely evil blade, full of imposing power!\n\nWhen Nian Bing opened his eyes, he found himself standing, and the Demon Devouring Blade, previously held firmly in the Black Martial Emperor's hand, was now in his own. In stark contrast to the Sacred Radiance Blade, this narrow blade seemed weightless. It was extremely light in his hand, with a cold, evil aura brewing within it, calm like a dormant magical beast. Nian Bing understood that he hadn't yet gained the blade's recognition; he had only undergone the first trial of the Demon Devouring Blade and the Black Martial Emperor. He firmly believed that this blade possessed sentience, and its sentience surpassed that of the few precious blades he had acquired.\n\nOne hand gripped the scabbard, the other gripped the hilt. The chilling sensation seemed to intensify somewhat, especially the evil aura. It shifted from outward release to inward containment. Nian Bing understood that the real test had arrived. A faint cold light appeared in his eyes. Nian Bing forcefully drew the Demon Devouring Blade from its scabbard with his right hand. The blade, like the scabbard, was equally dull and lusterless. Even in the Sacred Radiance Blade's brilliance, there was no reflection of light. Nian Bing, gripping the hilt with his right hand, slowly raised the Demon Devouring Blade. The black blade curved only slightly at the front. Although the blade was very thin and light, gripping it felt substantial. It felt as if a single strike could cleave through all obstacles. He gently moved his wrist, gazing at the pure black blade. Nian Bing softly said, \"Demon Devourer, Demon Devourer, from now on, I am your new master. Although I don't possess the formidable power of Senior Black Martial Emperor, I will never let you be disgraced. One day, I will make you unleash your most dazzling brilliance.\" After speaking the last sentence, Nian Bing's eyes suddenly blazed with light. Amidst Shilard's gasp of surprise, he forcefully threw the Demon Devouring Blade high into the air. The Demon Devouring Blade vanished into the air as it spun. Nian Bing extended his left arm straight out to his side and closed his eyes. His purpose was very simple: to wager his left arm to see if the Demon Devouring Blade would recognize him. Blades possessed sentience; he firmly believed this.\n\nShilard's heart suddenly constricted, but he did not stop Nian Bing. Since Nian Bing had made his choice, he respected this courageous decision. The spinning blade reappeared; its rotation was no longer as fast as when it was thrown upwards, and it was falling directly towards Nian Bing's left arm. No one would doubt that if the blade landed on Nian Bing's left arm, it would surely sever his arm.\n\nShilard suddenly closed his eyes. With a soft clang, the blade landed, a little less than half its body already embedded in the hard rock of the ground. Nian Bing and Shilard opened their eyes almost simultaneously. Their gazes were both fixed on Nian Bing's left arm. The left arm was still there, with a thin red mark appearing on his forearm. Blood, drop by drop, dripped from the red mark. It landed precisely on the sharp purple gemstone on the Demon Devouring Blade's hilt. The gemstone was stained blood-red. The previously dull blade suddenly erupted with a red glow. The purple gemstone lit up like a beacon. Although it wasn't as bright as the other gemstones Nian Bing possessed, it harbored immense dark energy. The moment it lit up, the light on the Sacred Radiance Blade violently fluctuated, instantly dimming by half.\n\nWith a soft hum, the Demon Devouring Blade's body trembled slightly. It was a sound of craving, as if Nian Bing's blood had reawakened it. A strange scene unfolded. The Black Martial Emperor's steel-like black skeleton suddenly changed. The black skeleton melted like ice and snow, forming a cloud of black powder that drifted upwards, surging towards the blade's red glow. When the red glow came into contact with the black powder, it devoured it, completely absorbing the black powder. The powder gradually vanished. The red glow on the blade also turned dark red, and the purple gemstone's brilliance gradually receded, returning to its original appearance. A circle of black aura drifted up from the blade, entwining around Nian Bing's left hand. With a *whoosh*, the blade actually flew towards Nian Bing's hand, guided by that black aura. Nian Bing subconsciously opened his palm and firmly gripped the Demon Devouring Blade's hilt. Upon this second contact, the feeling was completely different. Although the evil was still present, there was no longer any sense of invasion. It was as if connected by bone and flesh. The Demon Devouring Blade seemed to have become an extension of Nian Bing's left hand. He slowly raised his arm, holding the blade horizontally before his eyes. A faint smile appeared on Nian Bing's face.\n\n\"Your courage has gained the Demon Devourer's recognition. Master it well. Even the most evil blade, when used for good, can still be a blade of justice. I must return now. The Sacred Radiance Blade, which you renamed, will no longer bear my spiritual imprint. It will truly become your blade. Use it well. Just as you said, do not disappoint these divine blades of yours. One day, make them unleash their rightful brilliance. Oh, right, there's one thing I must remind you. When the Demon Devouring Blade was in the Black Martial Emperor's hands, it had a title: 'Curse of Eternal Hell'. Once your heart is filled with resentment, you might activate the curse. What will happen then, even I am not clear. I hope such a situation never arises. Since it's called a curse, it certainly won't be anything good.\" The white light also dimmed. With a soft clang, the Sacred Radiance Blade plunged into the ground. The white light forming the Holy Master drifted away, yet the Sacred Radiance Blade still gleamed with sacred white light. Nian Bing walked to the Sacred Radiance Blade. He gripped the hilt with his right hand and drew it out. He extended both arms to his sides. The auras of light and darkness simultaneously stimulated his body. Under this intense stimulation, the red and blue magical power of Ice and Fire Conjoined actually expanded more than before. Suddenly, a clearly visible black aura rapidly converged towards the Demon Devouring Blade. Rings of black aura continuously poured into it, while the evil aura in the surrounding air rapidly weakened. The Demon Devouring Blade itself didn't change, but the sense of evil it gave Nian Bing grew increasingly stronger.\n\nTime passed minute by minute. Nian Bing maintained his original posture throughout. Finally, when the last wisp of black aura surged towards the Demon Devouring Blade, its scabbard, which had been on the ground, turned to dust, and the stone walls surrounding this ten-thousand-zhang abyss turned gray. The original black evil aura completely disappeared. Nian Bing understood. After the Demon Devouring Blade recognized him as its master, it used its blade body to absorb all the remaining evil energy in the area, sealing it within itself. At this moment, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a little lost. Was gaining this blade of darkness a good thing or a bad thing? The Holy Master had just said that no matter how evil a blade, as long as the wielder isn't corrupted by evil and resentment, the Demon Devouring Blade could still be used for righteous purposes. That's right! The blade itself wasn't wrong. The only one who could be wrong was the person. He understood. To truly master this Demon Devouring Blade, he still had a very long road ahead. \"Demon Devourer, Demon Devourer, I will take you to devour all demons in this world.\"\n\nEarlier, when the Demon Devouring Blade descended, its blade did indeed touch Nian Bing's arm, but it merely grazed the surface, then landed on the ground while still spinning. The red mark on Nian Bing's left arm was only a minor scratch. Not even the muscle was harmed.",

    "content": "When Nian Bing felt the coldness of the Devouring Demon Blade, he truly thought he had lost his left arm, but. The moment the Devouring Demon Blade touched the ground, he clearly felt its call to him and its yearning for the Black Martial Emperor. At that moment, he understood that he had been recognized by this demonic artifact of the dark world, becoming its new master.\n\nWith a flash of silver light from the Spatial Ring, both the Sacred Radiance Blade and the Devouring Demon Blade were taken into its space by Nian Bing. Suddenly, the gem on the Spatial Ring, which had not had much light before, burst into a brilliant silver glow. The entire gem completely turned a crystal-like silver. As Nian Bing watched in astonishment, the ring seemed to fuse with his finger, silver light circling his finger once and then disappearing. But the gem on it still maintained its crystal-like silver color. What was going on? Had the Spatial Ring evolved?\n\n\"It evolved. You've placed so many exceptional blades into this ring, which isn't even top-grade. Under the influence of various auras, it has evolved into a better spatial magic item. That a storage magic item can evolve shows the wondrous nature of your precious blades. Master them well. I believe that one day you will surpass us predecessors and become a strong one among humans.\"\n\nNian Bing turned his gaze to Hilliard, smiling slightly, and said, \"Senior, thank you. We should go out now, I think. You should be able to summon your pet now.\"\n\nHilliard nodded, a smile also appearing on his face, and walked to Nian Bing's side. \"Don't call me Senior anymore. I'm older than you, and you and Mao Mao are friends. Just call me Uncle.\"\n\n\"Uncle?\" Nian Bing looked at Hilliard in surprise. \"You don't object to me interacting with Mao Mao anymore?\"\n\nHilliard sighed softly, \"If it's destined by heaven, how can human effort force it? After everything that happened today, I've understood many things. Nian Bing, you repaid kindness for hostility. Not only did you not dwell on my attempt to kill you, but you saved my life after falling into the abyss. For that alone, I already owe you too much. You are an excellent young man. Even if Mao Mao truly chooses you when she grows up, I can be at ease. So, there's nothing more to worry about. You and Mao Mao are friends, and I hope we can become friends too. I owe you a life.\"\n\nNian Bing stretched his body, smiling faintly, and said, \"The feeling of the sky clearing after the rain is truly wonderful, Uncle Hilliard. Don't worry, I truly regard Mao Mao as a younger sister. It's getting late. You should go back, otherwise, Mao Mao will worry. I think I'll walk by myself. By now, the culinary competition in Daru City must have ended, so there's no point in me returning. I'll go somewhere else; only by experiencing more can I grow better. We will meet again someday, Uncle. Goodbye, please take care. Ice, you are the representation of cold. Fire, you are the source of heat. Oh, auras of ice and fire, please allow me to fuse your characteristics, using your common origin as a guide, resonate!\" His hands crossed in front of him, drawing, a red triangle and a blue triangle intersected, forming a red and blue hexagram. Surging magic energy revolved around Nian Bing, the hexagram in front of him shining brightly.\n\nHilliard looked at Nian Bing, smiling, \"Young man, today you taught me a lesson. I also believe that we will meet again someday. Have a safe journey.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded with a smile. Amidst the silver light flashing on the Spatial Ring, the Whispers of the Wind of Freedom flew into Nian Bing's hand. \"Whispers of the Wind of Freedom! You can see everything in the world. You can travel to every corner of the earth. I request you, become my wings, and carry me to fly!\" Green light surrounded the Ice and Fire of the Same Origin magic hexagram. Guided by the Whispers of the Wind of Freedom, it enveloped Nian Bing's body, causing him to float up. Although the speed was not fast, his body steadily ascended. Nian Bing in the air waved to Hilliard, \"Goodbye, Uncle Hilliard.\"\n\nWatching Nian Bing gradually disappear at the end of the abyss, Hilliard smiled, \"Mimicry magic guided by Ice and Fire of the Same Origin. The abilities of a dragon are actually being used by a human. Nian Bing! You really are a strange mage. Perhaps, you will also be the first all-elemental mage on the continent. I await the day your radiance shines brightly.\"\n\nEscorted by the wind, Nian Bing finally flew out of the underground abyss, breathing the fresh air on the surface again. The feeling of being reborn greatly relieved his heart. He didn't land immediately; he simply distinguished the direction and flew southwest. While flying, Nian Bing looked at the Sky-Defying Blade in his hand, thinking to himself, \"When can I truly master the techniques of Mimicry Magic without using these magic blades?\" After the events of this night, Nian Bing became even more aware of the power of magic arrays. Such a powerful being as Dragon Summoner Hilliard, he was able to restrain him with an ancient magic array. If he could unearth more ancient magic arrays, it would certainly be of great benefit to his future magic cultivation.\n\nThinking of ancient magic arrays, he couldn't help but recall a place. Although he had only been there once, he clearly remembered how many records of magic arrays were there. His father once told him that if he could fully comprehend and master the magic books there, he could at least reach the realm of an Archmage. This time, going to participate in the Newcomer Mage Competition, he happened to think of a way to go and see, but he didn't know if he could successfully sneak in.\n\nSomewhere in the Langmu Empire.\n\nThe air in the forest was always so comfortable, but the atmosphere was not as relaxed as the air. Feng Xu's face was ashen as he looked at the wooden house in front of him. This was not an ordinary wooden house; around it, there was the Phoenix Clan's most primitive ancient magic array, specifically used to detain prisoners of their own clan.\n\n\"The second one. The second person to escape from here is actually you. Feng Yan, oh Feng Yan. You surely never thought that your daughter would become the second person to escape from here after you. Go on, all of you go. Is Heaven truly trying to destroy my Phoenix Clan lineage?\" As he spoke, two lines of tears streamed down Feng Xu's aged face. At that moment, he seemed to have aged a few more years.\n\n\"Big Brother,\" Feng Kong walked behind Feng Xu. \"Perhaps we pressured her too much. Feng Nu is still a child, and every girl yearns for love.\"\n\nA red light flashed, and the tears on Feng Xu's face vaporized. He snorted coldly, \"As the Phoenix of Hope of our clan, she should have long known what to give up. Moreover, does our clan lack excellent young people? Kong Di, you don't need to defend her. There's still time now. Before the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony, Feng Nu must be brought back, otherwise, we won't have even a sliver of a chance. Kong Di, Feng Nu has been closest to you since childhood. You take Feng Xiang, Feng Di, Feng Yue, and Feng Shun and set off now. By tracking her aura, I don't believe you won't catch her.\"\n\nFeng Kong sighed. He wanted to say something more, but seeing Feng Xu's desolate back, he shook his head and turned away.\n\nSomewhere in the forest. Pink long hair fluttered in the air. Feng Nu galloped through the mountains and forest. She was extremely familiar with this forest. Even with her eyes closed, she would never go the wrong way.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Elder. I had to leave. I love Nian Bing, Nian Bing died because of me, but I didn't even get to see him one last time. I must go collect his body. I must keep vigil for him for two years. Don't worry, before the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony, I will definitely return.\" At this moment, Feng Nu's heart was filled with sorrow and longing for Nian Bing.\n\nFeng Xu was wrong about one thing: as the Phoenix of Hope of the Phoenix Clan, Feng Nu had always known how great her responsibility was, and how deep the impact of Feng Yan's departure was on the Phoenix Clan. The first time she saw Nian Bing, when Nian Bing personally cooked her that pigeon meat meal, she developed a good impression of that handsome young man. Although he had a deep hatred, although he had a distant pursuit, he was so outstanding.\n\nLater, every time she saw Nian Bing again, Feng Nu was surprised to discover the changes in him, and she could clearly feel the sorrow Nian Bing kept hidden deep in his heart. Also having no parents, Feng Nu felt great sympathy for Nian Bing, and her good impression of him rapidly increased. However, despite this, Feng Nu only regarded Nian Bing as a friend. She knew she couldn't easily fall in love, especially not with an outsider. She represented the future of the Phoenix Clan.\n\nIn the Fire Dragon Cave, Nian Bing confessed his love to Feng Nu. Feng Nu suppressed her inner turmoil and explained her difficulties. Nian Bing did not make things difficult for her. At the last moment, he would rather sacrifice himself to save everyone. All of this left a deep imprint on Feng Nu's heart. At that time, although Nian Bing's life or death was unknown, Feng Nu could guess that Galamaidis, the Dragon King, under the temptation of food and the Dragon God's rules, would not necessarily harm Nian Bing. At that time, she still did not release her feelings. In her heart, her own clan members came first.\n\nAt the Duke's Mansion, seeing Nian Bing again, and seeing him return safely, emotion instantly triumphed over reason, causing her to throw herself into Nian Bing's arms. However, after just a moment, Feng Nu's reason returned. She knew that doing so would be detrimental to both herself and Nian Bing. So, she resolutely chose to pull away. But she never expected Elder Feng Xu to send Feng Xiang to kill Nian Bing. When she learned of Nian Bing's death from Elder Feng Kong, the suppressed emotions in her heart finally broke through all obstacles, breaking through all her inner taboos. Only at that moment did she realize that the name Nian Bing had firmly occupied her heart. She loved Nian Bing. Her heart only held Nian Bing. But he was already dead, killed because of her. That handsome young man who had once saved her, a man who, like her, had no parents, was just gone. His revenge had not yet been taken. He too suppressed his love for her, always thinking of her, yet he was just gone.\n\nWhen Feng Nu regained consciousness, she was back with the Phoenix Clan, imprisoned by Elder Feng Xu in the Restraint House. Feng Xu told her to think clearly, punishing her with confinement. Feng Nu did think clearly. She understood three things: the first was her love for Nian Bing. She knew that she could never love another man in this life. The second was Nian Bing's body, which was still in the forest. He was dead, and no one had even collected his body. No matter what, she had to ensure he was laid to rest! The last thing was Nian Bing's revenge. At that moment, she decided that no matter the cost, she would avenge Nian Bing's profound hatred. Nian Bing's hatred was her hatred. Although Nian Bing was already dead, she vowed to remain faithful to Nian Bing.\n\nOnly one person had ever escaped from the Phoenix Clan's Restraint House, and that was Feng Yan. Feng Nu never thought that she could escape with her own abilities. However, when her emotions completely erupted, when her beautiful blue eyes shed blood-red tears upon remembering Nian Bing, the restraint actually failed. The Phoenix Blood Tears sent her out of the Restraint House. She now only wanted to find Nian Bing's body as soon as possible and lay him to rest.\n\nWith her strength, having just reached the Martial Saint level, traveling was nothing for Feng Nu. Ten days later, she had returned to the forest where Nian Bing had the incident, but she searched every inch of land there and found no trace of Nian Bing's body. Was he carried away by wild beasts? No, because the forest was very close to Olan Empire, and fierce wild beasts had long been cleared from here. But where did Nian Bing go? Did he not die? Were the elders lying to her?\n\nWith an anxious heart, Feng Nu entered Olan City. Olan City was as it always was, but when she arrived at the Blue Feather Duke's Mansion entrance, she hesitated. Neither Yu Ruyan nor Duke Blue Feather was someone she could contend with. Should she go in and ask them? After hesitating for a while, Feng Nu gritted her teeth and walked towards the Duke's Mansion gate. She believed that Yu Ruyan, after all, was of her own clan, and since she wasn't seeking revenge, she might not harm her.\n\nJust as Feng Nu was about to enter the Duke's Mansion, the Duke's Mansion gate opened. A familiar figure appeared in Feng Nu's sight.\n\n\"Zi Qingjian, is that you?\" Feng Nu asked tentatively.\n\nZi Qingjian was wearing custom-made silver armor, which, combined with his majestic physique, made him appear even more robust. He was preparing to go out to buy some things he needed, but he never expected to encounter the person he longed for day and night as soon as he stepped out the door.\n\n\"Feng Nu.\" Zi Qingjian's voice was filled with eighty percent excitement and twenty percent surprise. He walked a few steps to Feng Nu's front. His resolute face seemed a little flustered. Suddenly seeing Feng Nu, he didn't know what to say.",

    "content": "「清劍大哥，你怎麼會在這裡？」鳳女驚訝地問道。\n\n紫清劍看著鳳女，心中不禁一痛。數月不見，鳳女變了，變得比以前憔悴了許多。她的眼神黯淡了，皮膚也失去了往日的光澤。雖然她依舊是那麼美麗，但從她那一身風塵就能看出受了許多苦。\n\n「鳳女，你這是怎麼了？你看上去很疲憊啊！當初和你分手後，我和妹妹就到這裡來投軍了。我拜了藍羽公爵為師，現在是銀羽騎士團中的一份子。」\n\n拜了藍羽公爵為師？鳳女心中一喜。既然如此，自己就不用進公爵府了，也省卻了許多麻煩。她趕忙急促地問道：「清劍大哥，後來你見過念冰麼？他曾經來過這裡。」\n\n紫清劍聽到鳳女提起念冰，心頭不禁一沉。就算他再粗線條，也能感覺得到鳳女的心並不在自己身上。他暗嘆一聲，道：「當然見過了。不過，念冰兄弟沒在這裡逗留多久就和那頭龍走了。他走的時候，還是我和妹妹去送的呢。」\n\n鳳女全身一顫，「大哥，你確定麼？你送走念冰是什麼時候？」\n\n紫清劍想了想，說出了日子。鳳女仔細一算，正是自己得知念冰死訊的兩天後。她的心顫抖了。「為什麼，空長老您要騙我？念冰沒死，沒死……」\n\n鳳女的嬌軀不斷地顫抖著，淚水不受控制地澎湃而下<sup>1</sup>。此時的她，看上去是如此的軟弱，哪兒還有一點 Martial Saint 的樣子。此時此刻，她心中充滿了對念冰無盡的思念。\n\n「鳳女，你沒事吧？」紫清劍看著鳳女。雖然他不明白鳳女為什麼會哭，但也隱約猜到與念冰有關。這些年來，自己是真的失去了一點希望都沒有了。心如死灰的感覺雖然不好受，但紫清劍還是控制住自己的情感沒有表露出來。畢竟，不論是念冰還是鳳女，都可以算是他的生死之交。他也只能將自己對鳳女的愛深埋於心底。\n\n鳳女擦掉眼中的淚水，追問道：「清劍大哥，你肯定念冰沒事麼？那他去了哪裡？」\n\n紫清劍堅定地點了點頭，道：「他沒事啊！和一頭龍在一起能有什麼事，那隻龍還指望他做飯呢。我聽念冰說，他好像要去華融帝國參加什麼 New Talent Magician Competition。估計現在正在路上吧。那個比賽要幾個月後才會開始呢。」\n\n鳳女美眸一亮。剎那間，失去的光彩似乎已經恢復了。她深深地看了紫清劍一眼，道：「謝謝你，清劍大哥，我先走了。」身影一閃。她也顧不得驚世駭俗，以最快的速度朝南方而去。\n\n看著鳳女消失的背影，紫清劍一陣失神，重重地嘆息一聲，轉身向公爵府走去。他已經沒有心情再去買東西了。\n\n「清劍，是你啊！」公爵府門開，婀娜的身影走了出來。一身藍色長裙的玉如煙看上去是那麼的高貴。\n\n「見過 Shimu (師母)<sup>2</sup>。」紫清劍自從聽藍羽公爵說了玉如煙是 Aolan Empire 第一高手後，對這位 Shimu 佩服地五體投地<sup>3</sup>，所以語氣上一向都非常恭敬。\n\n紫清劍是個直性子人，他臉色的變化立刻引起了玉如煙的注意，「清劍，你這是怎麼了？似乎有點不高興似的。」\n\n紫清劍輕嘆一聲，道：「Shimu，我剛才碰到鳳女。我聽藍尋兄說，上次鳳女他們曾經襲擊過您，您，您能不能不追究她？」\n\n「什麼？鳳女？」玉如煙全身一震，想起念冰據說的可能性，頓時急切地問道：「鳳女在哪裡？她人呢？」\n\n紫清劍誤會了玉如煙的意思，有些警惕地道：「Shimu，您不要難為她好不好？我想，鳳女也不是誠心與您為難的。」\n\n玉如煙眉頭一皺，道：「你這傻小子，我有說過會為難她麼？快告訴我她在哪裡，我要立刻去找她說點事。」\n\n紫清劍對鳳女的關心使他沒有完全說實話，「鳳女已經走了一會兒，她可能是要去找念冰吧。Shimu，您找她有什麼事？」\n\n玉如煙臉上流露出一絲苦笑，心中暗想，如果鳳女真的是自己的女兒，卻過門而不入，說起來，真是悲哀啊！以鳳女的能力，自己又不能確定準確的方向，想追也不容易了。「算了，既然她去找念冰了，事情總會水落石出<sup>4</sup>的。希望他們能夠早些見到吧。」\n\n***\n\n沒有參加 Hualong Culinary Competition 的最後一場比賽，對於念冰來說極為遺憾。並不是為了獎金，也不是為了 Chef God Competition 的參賽資格，而是因為小天。作為念冰出道以來的最大對手，作為 Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand 的使用者，念冰非常想堂堂正正地與他一戰。他之所以選擇離開而不是回去尋找小天重新比試，是因為時間的關係。\n\n得到了黑暗世界的 Demon-Devouring Blade，令念冰對實力的渴望更加強烈了。現在對他來說，魔法要比廚藝更為重要。所以，他選擇早些到 Dutian City 利用最後的一段時間多加修煉。同時，他也想多用一些時間將自己的 Seven-Element Culinary Arts 完善。那樣，才是一個整體的菜系，才能更好地和 Tai Chi Hand 抗衡。可惜的是，他現在還缺少一柄土系的魔法寶刀。\n\n不過他現在也不急，畢竟，得到那種級別的寶貝是可遇而不可求<sup>5</sup>的。念冰現在越來越覺得，自己的運氣實在不錯。\n\n用飛行前進是完全不受地形控制的。念冰為了不引起別人的注意，故意選擇了比較荒僻的地形，但卻距離官道並不遠。這樣就可以遠離人群，放心地飛行了。他飄然落在地面上，伸展著自己的軀身體，雙手在胸前畫出兩個三角，紅、藍兩色光芒在交織中構成了 Ice-Fire Coexistence Hexagram。\n\n念冰輕喝一聲。在精神力的引動中，六道光芒接連從自己的 Spatial Ring 中飄飛而出，氤氳寶氣飄然而出。六色光芒在 Ice-Fire Coexistence Hexagram 的控制中圍繞著念冰的身體緩慢旋轉著。念冰心中充滿了成就感，雙手在身前一引，再向下按出。「定。」\n\nIce-Fire Coexistence Hexagram 瞬間擴大，印在念冰腳下。而那六色光芒中的紅藍兩道光芒瞬間插於念冰腳下那 Hexagram 的中央，其餘四色光芒則穩穩地插在魔法陣的周圍。六色光芒閃耀，形成一個氤氳光罩圍繞著念冰的身體。\n\n念冰滿意地笑了。這是他根據 Ice-Fire Coexistence Mimicry Magic，不會有魔法力銜接不上的情況出現。\n\n看著周圍的六柄神刃，念冰不禁輕吟道：「Sigh of the Ice Goddess。Roar of the Fire God。Whisper of the Free Wind。Dawn Piercing the Heavens。Ever-Changing Hexagram。Curse of Eternal Hell。是你們帶給我強大的魔力，你們是我未來的希望啊！」\n\n或許是感受到了念冰精神力波動，氤氳寶氣升騰而起，變得更加濃郁了。微微一笑，念冰眼中光芒大放，雙手下按，眼中神光湛放。他輕輕地一掌下拍，引動那氤氳寶氣。緊接著，他伸出自己的右手，掌心向上。第一個出現的是藍色的光球，那並不是魔法，而是純純的魔法力。藍色的潛力散發著冰冷的氣息。緊接著，藍光突然一轉，變成了紅色，再由紅變青、由青變白，由白變銀，由銀變黑。六色光芒交替閃耀著，空氣中的各種魔法元素不斷地圍繞著念冰的身體旋轉升騰著。感受著魔法元素在變換間產生的種種特性，念冰深深沉浸於其中。自身的冰火兩種魔法力就在這 Ice-Fire Coexistence Magic Array 中不斷地增強著。因為飛行而消耗的魔法力快速恢復，這就是他現在最主要的修煉方法。可惜，這種修煉方法太過於醒目，所以只能在無人的野外進行。否則，別人看見，必然會因為他這六柄刀而動心。\n\n在修煉魔法力的過程中不忘修煉精神力已經成了念冰的習慣。精神力完全外放，覆蓋防禦數百丈<sup>6</sup>範圍。哪怕只有一點風吹草動<sup>7</sup>，他都能第一時間感覺到。這樣，不但對他的精神力鍛鍊很有好處，同時，也能夠保護自己不被突然出現的敵人傷害。\n\n光影閃爍，六柄神刃同時升騰起一層光芒。念冰心中突然產生一絲明悟，並不是因為魔法，反而是對廚藝的感觸。得到了 Demon-Devouring Blade 後，他一直感覺到自己對血腥的厭惡，並不是厭惡殺人，而是厭惡刀上的血腥氣息。自己是一名廚師，如果自己的刀上有血腥氣息，又如何能夠烹飪呢？\n\n六柄神刃不但是自己的魔法刀，同時也是自己的菜刀啊！作為一名廚師，尊敬自己的廚具，尊敬吃自己東西的人，是必須的。在這一剎那，念冰決定了，除非是在烹飪的時候，絕不讓自己的這些神刀再沾染上血腥的氣息。\n\n雖然在今天之前，即使是自己的刀斬殺敵人時，也只是刀上的光芒所致，但從現在開始，自己一定要倍加小心，一定不能讓這些神刀成為自己的殺人武器。他們是魔法刀，魔法，同樣可以對付敵人。\n\n精神力引動魔法陣中的能量。嗡的一聲，最沉重的 Sacred Radiance Blade 已經躍入念冰手中。雙手握住 Sacred Radiance Blade 高舉過頭。Saint Master 出現過後，這柄 Sacred Radiance Blade 上的聖潔氣息更加濃郁了。Ice-Fire Coexistence Magic Array 的紅、藍兩色光芒驟然大盛。念冰吟唱道：「以 Dawn Piercing the Heavens 為引，給大地帶來溫暖的光明，聖潔無暇的光明啊！請你們融合為一，凝結於天地之間，化為淨化萬物的聖光吧。」\n\n白色的光芒驟然升騰，以 Dawn Blade 為中心射入高空，籠罩的範圍正好是念冰腳下的魔法陣。除了 Demon-Devouring Blade 以外，其他的幾柄神刃都在這聖光之中發出了歡快的清吟。念冰是在用聖光化解這些神刃上的戾氣。\n\n只有 Demon-Devouring Blade 散發出一層黑色的霧氣，與聖光碰觸在一起，發出噗噗的聲響。念冰沒有停止自己的動作，將 Sacred Radiance Blade 送回原來的位置，再次換過一柄神刃，同樣用出了一個七階魔法。當他換到最後一柄刀時，卻愣住了。作為一名魔法師，他對黑暗魔法的咒語並不熟悉。以前在圖書館時雖然也看到過一些黑暗魔法的咒語，但是他從沒想過要使用黑暗魔法。再加上黑暗魔法的大都殘缺不全，咒語吟唱的語調又非常艱澀。所以，他知道的黑暗咒語並不多，一時間都不知道應該如何吟唱了。看著手中狹長的 Demon-Devouring Blade，念冰隱隱感覺到，如果自己想真正掌握 Mimicry Magic，關鍵並不在能否得到一柄土系神刃，而是在於能否真正掌握這柄 Demon-Devouring Blade。\n\n以 Ice-Fire Coexistence 為引，念冰先後使用了五個七階魔法。精神力並沒問題，但是他的魔法力卻消耗得有些多了。就算是 Archmage，不間斷地使用這麼高階魔法，負荷也是極大的。幸虧念冰的精神力極為充裕，這才能夠堅持得住。\n\n重新回到冥想狀態，念冰恢復著自己消耗的魔法力。從開始的凝聚到魔法的使用再到最後的冥想，是念冰一整套修煉的過程。每經過一次這樣的過程，在最後的冥想時他才會有一些體悟，而他在魔法力上也會有一定程度的進步。\n\n對於念冰來說，現在已經沒有了白天黑夜之分。每次飛行兩個 *shichen*<sup>8</sup> 左右，他就會找到一片偏僻的地方修煉一遍，然後再起身飛行，偶爾吃上一些簡單的食物充飢。對於他來說，這樣不但不會使他疲倦，精神反而越來越好，能夠清晰地感覺到自己的魔法在不斷地進步上，尤其是使用 Mimicry Magic 的圓融上更是體現得很清晰。\n\n連念冰自己也不知道在這種修煉過程中過了多長時間，但他的方向感很強。再加上幼年時的回憶，始終能夠認清準確的方位前進著。\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> The original text contains a likely typo: \"不牛農對泣\" (bù niú nóng duì qì).

    "content": "The Flying Art was much more proficient than when he first used it. The feeling of soaring in mid-air was extremely wonderful. Feeling the refreshing breeze on his face, watching the birds and clouds beside him, the sensation of floating to immortality¹ was so comfortable. Suddenly, Nianbing, who was flying in mid-air, trembled all over. His forward speed abruptly decreased. Although still far away, he had already seen that city.\n\nDutian City, situated on the Dutian Plateau. The Dutian Plateau is the only plateau in the southern part of the Yangguang Continent. At first, the terrain gradually rose, but halfway through, it ascended sharply. Although there were no high mountains or steep ridges, the air had gradually thinned due to the rising altitude. Dutian City itself was located in the exact center of the entire Dutian Plateau, not far from where the terrain began to rise. From here, one could get a bird's-eye view of a large part of the Dutian Plateau ahead, making its geographical location excellent. If enemies could attack here, by simply utilizing the elevation difference of the plateau and relying on the Huarong Empire's powerful cavalry, they could easily scatter the enemy's formation. Even if merely defending, the advantage of the terrain would allow the immense Dutian City to remain as stable as a rock.\n\nDutian City boasted an extremely vast built-up area and was known as the Continent's Foremost City. The garrison within the city totaled a full fifty thousand troops, of whom twenty thousand were cavalry. The Flame Lion Knights, the most elite knight order in the entire Yangguang Continent, were among them, numbering ten thousand strong, and were the Huarong Empire's most formidable force. Another ten-thousand-strong knight order served as the reserve force for the Flame Lion Knights, named the Fire Bloom Knights. Although not as formidable as the Flame Lion Knights, those capable of serving as their reserves were all knights selected one in a thousand. The Flame Lion Knights were the continent's most elite knight order; similarly, their benefits were also the highest. Maintaining such a knight order was equivalent to maintaining three fully equipped heavy cavalry knight orders. However, everyone knew that one Flame Lion was enough to crush three heavy cavalry knight orders.\n\nIn front of Dutian City lay a moat ten *zhang*² wide, which encircled the entire city. Dutian City's structure was very peculiar. Unlike ordinary cities with gates on all four sides, it only had city gates in the north and south directions. The entire city was rectangular, narrow north-south and long east-west. This made the city walls on both the north and south sides extremely wide. At these two walls, there were eight arch gates on each side, four *zhang* high and three *zhang* wide. These could be connected to the opposite bank of the moat via chain drawbridges. The fifteen *zhang* high city walls looked incredibly magnificent. The walls were one and a half *zhang* thick and had powerful defensive magic arrays on them, maintained by mages in rotation.\n\nGazing at the magnificent city below, Nianbing's eyes unconsciously moistened. He was back, he had returned. This was his hometown! What was ridiculous was that this time, he had returned representing another country. Huarong Empire, the place that had caused his father to leave heartbroken; he had finally returned. \"Father, rest assured, Nianbing will not disgrace you.\"\n\nFrom afar, Nianbing had already landed on the ground. He certainly did not wish to be discovered by the soldiers on watch atop the city walls. Only four of Dutian City's eight colossal northern gates were open; all eight gates would only be opened during wartime. Perhaps because the Huarong Empire's most elite troops were stationed here, and the Central Army Group's barracks were not far outside the city, the gates of Dutian City were undefended. Only a few soldiers symbolically guarded each gate entrance.\n\nNianbing straightened his ordinary clothes and strode towards the city gate. As he walked, he calculated the time: there was still a month and a half until the Five-Nations New Talent Mage Competition. He could use this month and a half to familiarize himself with his hometown's environment and make a final push in his magic. For this competition, Nianbing's goal was simple: to defeat Qianhuan Bingyun, who represented the Ice God Pagoda. As for the championship, it was not particularly important to him. Nianbing firmly believed that even if Qianhuan Bingyun's magical power was higher than his own, he would certainly have a chance by virtue of his ice and fire of the same origin trait.\n\nHe smoothly entered Dutian City. The city's spaciousness was evident in its roads. Even the roads within Ice Snow City, the Ice Moon Empire's second-largest city, were not half as wide as those in Dutian City. The roads were paved with neat bluestones, and besides the dense rows of shops along both sides, there was a large tree every so often, making the air within the city very comfortable. Although it was a plateau, because the Sky Azure River flowed into the Huarong Empire and it was located in the south, the air here was very humid. Even though Nianbing had no good impressions of Dutian City, he had to admit that it was indeed a very livable city. Compared to when he left as a child, the city looked even tidier. There were none of the hawkers' cries found in other cities; although there were many pedestrians, the city still appeared very quiet.\n\n\"Oh, Little Prince, why are you dressed like this? What are you up to today?!\" An astonished voice rang out. Nianbing looked back and saw a middle-aged man in luxurious clothes passing by, looking at him in surprise. Was he greeting him? As he thought this, a surprised expression appeared on Nianbing's face. The middle-aged man in luxurious clothes had a plum blossom mark on his left chest. Childhood memories instantly welled up in Nianbing's mind. The plum blossom symbol represented the Mei Family of the Huarong Empire. This family held upper-middle influence within the Huarong Empire, with its patriarch being a hereditary count. Clearly, this middle-aged man was a noble.\n\nSeeing Nianbing look at him in surprise, the middle-aged man in luxurious clothes stepped forward and said cordially: \"Little Prince, although you're wearing commoner's clothes, your demeanor simply cannot be changed. My sister has been thinking of you, you know. When you have time, come visit us. Soon it'll be time to host the New Talent Mage Competition, and I'm sure you'll be the final champion then. At that time, His Majesty will bestow a high position upon you, but please don't forget your Brother Mei!\"\n\nNianbing's thoughts raced like lightning. Suddenly, he understood something. A faint smile appeared on his face. \"Hello, Brother Mei. I still have some matters to attend to. Let's talk another day.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man in luxurious clothes quickly said, \"Alright, alright, Little Prince, go attend to your business. When you're free, please come visit me as a guest, don't forget!\" After speaking, he chuckled heartily and turned away.\n\nStanding rooted to the spot, various thoughts surged within Nianbing's mind. For a long while, he did not move, his right fist tightly clenched. It seemed he would also participate in this New Talent Mage Competition, only he would be representing the Huarong Empire. Upon realizing this, Nianbing suddenly understood something. His gaze swept over the surrounding shops. Seizing the moment when no passersby were paying attention, he retrieved his bamboo hat from his spatial ring, put it on his head, and strode into a ready-to-wear clothing store.\n\n\"Sir, what can I do for you?\" a shop assistant politely asked.\n\nNianbing said, \"I'd like to buy a more luxurious piece of clothing, one that symbolizes status. Also, I'd like to buy some gold thread and needles. Do you have them here? Money is not an issue.\"\n\nThe shop assistant smiled slightly. \"Of course we do. Please come with me. You can choose for yourself inside.\" Led by the assistant, Nianbing followed him into the clothing store. In a short while, he selected a luxurious red garment with gold trim. The garment was made from premium fabric, soft to the touch, and the size was just right. Although it cost Nianbing two purple gold coins, he was very satisfied. After buying two needles and a spool of gold thread, he then left the clothing store. With these items, he had enough to complete his plan.\n\nBack on the street, Nianbing found an ordinary inn and checked in. After the attendant left, he immediately took out the luxurious garment. Gazing at the robe, resplendent in its red and gold hues, he murmured to himself: \"If I remember correctly, you liked red and gold when you were little. This outfit should be suitable for your status, right?\" As he spoke, he threaded the gold thread into a needle. Although needlework was generally done only by women, Nianbing had lived with Cha Ji for so many years, and it was he who mended Cha Ji's and his own clothes. Therefore, this did not pose a challenge to him. After recalling carefully, Nianbing flattened the left chest area of the luxurious garment and cautiously began embroidering. As he embroidered, he recalled the former emblem. Even the Dragon Dance Collection blade technique, he could wield with ease, so simple embroidery was no challenge to him at all. In a short while, a fist-sized golden lion's head emblem appeared on the left chest of the luxurious garment.\n\nPutting away the needle and thread, Nianbing gently felt the golden lion emblem. He sighed lightly and said: \"It's at least seventy to eighty percent similar, right? That's enough. After all, who would check the Little Prince's emblem?\"\n\nPlacing the luxurious garment into his spatial ring, Nianbing became lost in his memories. Everything from his childhood was still so clear.\n\n...\n\n\"Ouch, it hurts so much! Brother, I'm in pain.\" A child of about five years old fell to the ground, immediately crying out in pain.\n\n\"Nianbing, how could you be so careless? Come, get up quickly. Ah! Your knee is scraped. Come on, I'll carry you to the doctor.\" A slightly older child quickly helped him up. Apart from being taller than the younger child, their appearances were remarkably seventy to eighty percent alike, both with golden hair and blue eyes.\n\n\"Brother, you're so good. Why are you so good to me?\"\n\n\"Idiot, because I'm your brother! Our fathers are the closest brothers, and we are also the closest brothers. This will never change, Nianbing, I will always protect you.\"\n\n\"Bro...\"\n\nHis eyes felt warm from the memories. Nianbing still clearly remembered everything from that time. He was half a year older than himself. Among their many siblings, only he genuinely treated him well. Perhaps it was because his father and his own father were twin brothers. \"Brother, I've returned, but I can't go see you. Brother, how are you doing? Perhaps, our paths will only cross at the Mage Competition.\"³\n\nSuppressing the emotions in his heart, Nianbing stood up, put on his bamboo hat, and left the inn. He still needed one more thing.\n\nLeaving the inn, Nianbing quickly found a shop specializing in magic items. No matter the country, magic item shops always had the best business. Of course, without some significant strength, how could one easily open such a shop?\n\n\"Customer, what would you like? We have all kinds of magic gems and magic items here, especially many excellent defensive pieces. We're sure to have something that satisfies you.\"\n\nNianbing looked around. Inside the shop was a circular counter, and on the wall one *zhang* behind the counter hung various magic items. With his mental power, he could naturally easily detect whether the magical aura on these magic items was potent. However, even if there were truly excellent items here, they were not what he needed. Besides, how could truly excellent items just appear casually?\n\n\"I'd like a magic item that can change one's appearance. Do you happen to have one?\" Nianbing asked.\n\nThe shop assistant was stunned for a moment, then quickly said, \"Sir, as you know, these special magic items are extremely expensive.\"\n\nNianbing said calmly, \"I only asked if you have it. Money is not an issue. As long as the item is suitable, the price is negotiable.\"\n\nThe shop assistant said with some regret, \"I'm very sorry. We originally had one here, but unfortunately, it was just chosen by a young lady. Perhaps you could come back in a few days.\"\n\nNianbing frowned slightly, thinking to himself, *it seemed he would have to find another shop.* Just as he was thinking, the curtain to the inner room of the shop suddenly parted, and a red-clad girl walked out, accompanied by a middle-aged man who looked like the shop manager. At this moment, Nianbing was preparing to leave. The moment the girl emerged from the inner room, she saw him. A hint of joy flashed in her eyes, and with a flicker of her figure, she was already behind Nianbing. A warning barely rose in Nianbing's heart before the bamboo hat on his head was gone, revealing his long golden hair.\n\n\"I knew it was you! Hmph, I'd recognize you even if you changed your clothes. Tell me, were you secretly following me?\" The red-clad girl's voice held a hint of eagerness.\n\nNianbing turned to look at her. He did not know this girl. Her face was extremely beautiful, her figure tall and slender, and she was looking at him with a charming smile. He couldn't help but sigh inwardly, *another one who's mistaken me*. He could only bite the bullet and say, \"Of course I wasn't looking for you. I came to buy a magic item.\"\n\nThe girl pouted slightly and said, \"Hmph, cut it out. I don't believe you. What magic items *doesn't* your family have? Why would you need to come out and buy one?\"\n\nThe shop assistant, seeing that the girl knew Nianbing, quickly said, \"Miss Yinuo, this gentleman indeed came to buy a magic item. What he wanted to buy was the one you just selected.\"\n\nYinuo looked at Nianbing in surprise and said, \"Oh, so you are! Are you trying to go on a secret rendezvous⁴ somewhere? Otherwise, why would you hide your appearance?\"\n\nNianbing said, a little amused, \"Me? Am I that kind of person? On the contrary, why did *you* buy this magic item? According to your logic, aren't you going to...\"\n\n---\n¹ *Piāopiāo yù xiān zhī gǎn* (飄飄欲仙之感): A feeling of extreme lightness and euphoria, as if one is about to float up and become an immortal.\n² *Zhang* (丈): An ancient Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or 10 feet.\n³ The original Chinese character here (網頁, *wǎngyè*) literally means \"webpage,\" which appears to be a typo or anachronism.

    "content": "Yinuo's pretty face reddened, and she looked at Nianbing somewhat surprised, saying, \"Why are you talking so much today? But, I like you like this; it's not good to be cold all day long. Alright, I'm leaving. I'm warning you, don't tell anyone that I snuck out, otherwise, hmph hmph, you know. I'll let you have it. Remember, you owe me a favor, okay?\" As she spoke, she tossed a brocade box to Nianbing, gave him a deep look, and turned to leave. Nianbing stared blankly as Yinuo departed, sighing bitterly to himself. It seemed his brother's identity was truly useful! \"When we grow up, will our appearances still be so similar? First, that Sister Mei, and now Miss Yinuo… Brother, just how many lady friends do you have?\"\n\nNianbing asked the attendant, \"How much is this? And how do I use it?\" As he spoke, he opened the brocade box, revealing an unremarkable brooch. The brooch was gourd-shaped, inlaid with two dark green gems. Its inherent magical fluctuation wasn't strong, yet Nianbing clearly sensed two strange magic arrays within it that he had never seen before. In his previous understanding, regardless of the type of magic array, the foundation lay in those magic symbols, but the magic arrays hidden within this brooch were clearly not the same. Both the construction of the magic arrays and the effects produced by the peculiar symbols within them greatly surprised Nianbing.\n\nThe attendant respectfully said, \"Sir, Miss Yinuo has already settled the bill for this brooch. Since she gave it to you, it is yours. I'll briefly explain its usage. The most precious aspect of this brooch is that it doesn't require a mage to use it. You just need to wear it on your chest, and when you wish it to activate, gently press the two gems on it. The slightly larger one will alter your appearance, and the smaller one will change your hair color. As for its principle, I am not sure. However, after each use, its internal magic power needs to be replenished. Mages of any element can replenish its magic. You will need to ask a mage for help for it to work next time. Currently, it is fully charged with magic.\"\n\nLooking at the small brooch, Nianbing curiously asked, \"Then what is the price of this brooch? I want to know how big of a favor I owe.\"\n\nThe shopkeeper, who had seen Yinuo out, returned. Hearing Nianbing's question, he smiled and said, \"Such a precious brooch. Its price naturally wouldn't be low. After all, sometimes altering one's appearance can save a life! It is valued at three hundred Purple Gold Coins, but since Miss Yinuo is a VIP of our shop, she received a thirty percent discount, making the total three hundred and ten Purple Gold Coins.\"¹\n\nNianbing gasped, \"Two hundred and ten Purple Gold Coins, that's two thousand one hundred Gold Coins!\" He truly owed no small favor this time. It seemed Miss Yinuo's status was not low; otherwise, how could she casually give away such a precious item? \"Brother, it seems she is truly deeply in love with you!\" Thinking this, Nianbing couldn't help but smile. He had gained such a huge advantage by utilizing his brother's identity.\n\nBack at the inn, Nianbing ate a simple meal. Although the inn's food was good, for him, it merely served to fill his stomach and couldn't be considered enjoyment.\n\nIt was just afternoon when he returned to his room. Nianbing sat cross-legged on the bed and began his daily meditation. Unfortunately, after entering the city, he could no longer use high-level magic to expend his magic power, which was the most effective way to cultivate. His mental energy extended outwards as usual, and the ice and fire elemental magic within him rapidly gathered the magic elements in the air. Soon, he entered a state of profound meditation.\n\nAs his strength increased, Nianbing could accurately control his meditation time unless he was on the verge of a major breakthrough. When he awoke from his meditation, it was just dusk.\n\nHe opened his eyes. Feeling the surging magic power within him, a hint of longing appeared in Nianbing's eyes. His mood was a little tense. \"Am I really going today? Go. Since I'm already back, and since I've decided to seek out ancient magic array scriptures, I can't hesitate any longer. What must be faced will eventually be faced. As long as I'm careful, I shouldn't be discovered.\" Thinking this, he resolutely got out of bed and took out the newly purchased luxurious robe from his Spatial Ring. Donning the robe, Nianbing looked down at the golden lion he had personally embroidered on his chest. A sudden feeling of boiling blood surged through him. He should have had this status originally! Unfortunately, he had already been unrecognized ten years ago.\n\nWithout using the door, Nianbing quietly opened the window, cast a Blizzard spell on himself, and swiftly soared into the air, heading towards the depths of Dutian City. The place he sought was not mysterious; it was a place almost everyone in Dutian City knew. Indeed! Even if someone didn't know the location of the imperial palace, it was impossible not to know where Prince Rong, the Huarong Empire's Imperial Advisor, known as the Flame Lion King, resided. The Rong family rose during times of war. It could be said that the Rong family was responsible for at least half of the Huarong Empire's current success. Back then, it was the old Prince Rong who led his clansmen and retainers, forming a thousand-strong cavalry, and with powerful fire element magic, helped the Huarong Empire's current monarch, Emperor Hua Tian, conquer the present empire. It was often said that as long as Prince Rong was present, the Huarong Empire would always remain the continent's foremost nation. For decades, Prince Rong commanded the Huarong Empire's military power nationwide. Through his efforts, the Huarong Imperial Army achieved its current flourishing state. Prince Rong and Prime Minister Su Yue, one civil and one martial, were the Huarong Empire's greatest contributors. Of course, Emperor Hua Tian was also a wise monarch. Back then, after the Huarong Empire entered its golden age, some people suggested to him that Prince Rong held too much power and, by controlling the national army, could potentially stage a coup at any time. All those who made such suggestions died, falling under the executioner's blade. Hua Tian had stated that the Huarong Empire, named Huarong, intrinsically held half of the Rong family's legacy. When the Huarong Empire was first established, the imperial throne was originally yielded to him by Prince Rong. If Prince Rong desired to be emperor, he would not need a military coup at all. As long as Prince Rong lived, the Huarong Empire's military authority would forever remain in his hands. When Prince Rong heard these rumors, he laughed heartily, saying, \"Hua Tian and I are not only monarch and subject, but also brothers. What good is a small-minded person's instigation?\"\n\nFrom afar, Nianbing already saw the enormous compound. Its fiery red walls enclosed a garden the size of a small city, filled with a stern aura. Nianbing's eyes welled up. He thought of his parents, his lineage, and simultaneously, the surname he should bear. \"My surname is Rong, I am Rong Nianbing! Father, do you see? I have returned.\"\n\nPrince Rong Yan was Nianbing's grandfather. Nianbing knew too much about the relationship between his grandfather and Emperor Hua Tian. Although his father took him away from the Rong family, his father's respect for his grandfather never diminished. Fifty years ago, the Huarong Empire did not exist on the continent. It was Hua Tian, Rong Yan, and Su Yue who, working together, established this foundation with the strength of their respective families. At that time, the Rong family's power was originally the strongest, but Rong Yan knew he was not suitable to be an emperor, so he yielded the position of monarch to Hua Tian. This was how the Huarong Empire came into being. Rong Yan had six wives, who bore him seven sons and six daughters. Among them, Rong Yan's most beloved were his eldest and second sons, a pair of twins. To commemorate his joint founding of the Huarong Empire with Hua Tian and Su Yue, Rong Yan named his twin sons Rong Yue and Rong Tian. Later, Rong Tian fell in love with the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's direct disciple, who was Nianbing's mother, Bing Ling. As a powerful Fire Element Grand Archmage, Rong Yan was always at odds with the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess. How could he allow his son to associate with the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's disciple? Similarly, Nianbing's mother was also reprimanded by the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, who forcibly separated the loving couple. However, they did not know that Rong Tian and Bing Ling were deeply in love and had already consummated their marriage. To protect her child, Bing Ling secretly escaped from the Ice God Tower and came to the Huarong Empire to find Rong Tian. Rong Yan greatly loved his two brothers, Rong Yue and Rong Tian, and after confining Rong Tian for a few days, he released him. When Bing Ling arrived in Dutian City and reunited with the man she deeply loved, Rong Tian dared not make a fuss. He quietly arranged for Bing Ling to stay in a quiet small courtyard, and every day, apart from his family's routine cultivation, he would secretly meet Bing Ling in the courtyard. Although everything was done in secret, they lived very happily. Unfortunately, their happiness was brief. Less than two months after Bing Ling gave birth to Nianbing, disaster suddenly struck.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess had always considered Bing Ling her successor, yet she never expected her most cherished disciple to quietly run away like that. Enraged, the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess mobilized the entire Ice God Tower's power to search the continent for Bing Ling's whereabouts, finally finding her in Dutian City when Nianbing was two months old. The appearance of the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess in the capital of the Huarong Empire immediately caught the attention of Flame Lion King Rong Yan. Rong Yan, leading his two younger brothers, all three Grand Archmages, engaged in a great battle with the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess. That battle was truly world-shaking; the four fought for three full hours on the outskirts of Dutian City. In the end, the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, who had already entered the God Descender realm, still gained the upper hand, defeating Rong Yan and his two companions. That battle not only established the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's prestige but was also regarded by Rong Yan as a great humiliation. Bing Ling was taken away by the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, and Rong Tian was imprisoned back in the Rong family. He painstakingly raised Nianbing. After this incident, Rong Yan was greatly disappointed in his second son. He refused to see Rong Tian again and placed him under Rong Yue's custody. Both Rong Tian and little Nianbing were unwelcome in the Rong family. If not for Rong Yue protecting them, Rong Tian didn't know how much hardship he would have endured. At that time, besides caring for his son, Rong Tian desperately practiced magic every day, hoping that one day he could rescue his wife. However, magic alone was not enough. After several instances of nearly suffering cultivation deviation², Rong Yue could no longer bear to watch. He helped Rong Tian secretly take out the Rong family's most treasured Flame God Stone and quietly sent Nianbing and Rong Tian out of the city. At that time, Nianbing was only six years old.\n\nAfter leaving the Rong family, Rong Tian was not well. Rong Yan learned that Rong Tian and Rong Yue had stolen the Flame God Stone.³ He not only severely punished Rong Yue but also sent people to pursue Rong Tian and his son for a thousand li. Fortunately, Rong Tian was powerful and extremely clever, managing to evade capture by constantly hiding. Rong Tian's suffering was known only to himself: his wife taken away by forced separation, having a home yet unable to return. He endured the pain, wandering the continent with Nianbing. With the help of the Flame God Stone, he finally reached the Archmage realm. Later, he unexpectedly heard that the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess was going to hold an Ice Goddess Priestess Succession Ceremony for Bing Ling. Once this ceremony was held, Bing Ling would be completely purified by her master, the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, by invoking the divine power of the Ice and Snow Goddess. She would not only regain her virginity but also forget everything that had happened before, like a newborn infant. Rong Tian could no longer bear it. How could he watch his beloved wife forget him and their son? So, when Nianbing was ten years old, he took his son to the Ice God Tower.\n\nThe battle at Ice God Tower did not last long. Although Rong Tian was exceptionally gifted, even the Flame Lion King was no match for the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, let alone him. Just as Rong Tian was about to die by the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's hand, Bing Ling erupted, breaking through the seal's restraints in one go and saving Rong Tian from her master. However, she knew very well that she and Rong Tian would never be able to escape. In that moment of crisis, she and Rong Tian separately slipped the Ice and Snow Goddess Stone and the Flame God Stone to Nianbing, then unleashed their most powerful magic, covering Nianbing's escape using a spatial magic scroll.\n\nFloating in mid-air, recalling everything that had happened to his parents, tears had already soaked Nianbing's collar. At this moment, his heart was filled with longing for his parents. \"Heavens! Why do you treat our family like this? Father, Mother, and I—we had no excessive demands. We only wished to live a peaceful life, that would have been enough. But even such a small request was such a luxury for us. Damn it, what are gods, what is heaven? It's all fake. If I can possess the power to control everything, everything will be trampled beneath my feet.\"\n\nCarrying a heart full of hatred, Nianbing suddenly reined in his aura and headed towards the Rong Mansion below at the fastest possible speed. Could he successfully infiltrate the Rong Mansion?\n\n...\n\nDarkness, endless darkness. An ominous aura permeated the entire Cave of Nothingness. Although it was full of yin energy⁴, it was exceptionally dry.\n\n\"Daddy, Daddy, aren't I amazing? I even captured a Necromancer! Daddy, you have to reward me, okay?\" Youyou bounced and skipped excitedly in the cave. The vampire Pingchao stood some distance away, head bowed, his demeanor extremely respectful.\n\n***\n¹ Translator's Note: There is a numerical discrepancy in the original text. The shopkeeper states the item is valued at 300 Purple Gold Coins with a 30% discount, making the total \"three hundred and ten Purple Gold Coins.\" However, Nianbing's internal monologue immediately calculates the price as \"Two hundred and ten Purple Gold Coins,\" which is 70% of 300. The translation retains this inconsistency as present in the original.\n² Cultivation deviation: A common concept in cultivation fiction, referring to a dangerous state where a practitioner's cultivation goes awry, leading to mental instability, physical harm, or a loss of control over their powers.\n³ Translator's Note: The original Chinese phrase here is \"盜趣聞火焰神之石\" (dào qùwén huǒyàn shén zhī shí). \"趣聞\" (qùwén) typically means \"anecdote\" or \"interesting story.\" Given the context that a physical item, the Flame God Stone, was stolen and its theft led to severe punishment and pursuit, it is highly probable that \"趣聞\" is a typographical error in the original text, and the intended meaning was simply \"stole the Flame God Stone\" or a similar phrasing indicating the theft of the item itself. The translation reflects this probable intent.\n⁴ Yin energy: In traditional Chinese philosophy and medicine, Yin is a concept representing the feminine, darkness, cold, and passivity, often associated with negative or spiritual energies in a fantastical context.",

    "content": "Standing in the very center of the cave was a person shrouded entirely in black robes. His figure was extremely tall, yet his large black cloak and the black mask on his face concealed every inch of his skin. The faintly green skull was being held in his hands. Beside him stood a woman of exceptionally stunning beauty. The woman had long, blood-red hair, and a faint cold arrogance emanated from her black eyes. Her aura was so chilling, and her devilish figure could not be concealed by the black robe she wore. Only when her gaze fell upon Youyou did a hint of softness appear in her eyes.\n\nThe woman spoke, \"Pingchao, you've done well this time. Not only did you protect the Young Mistress admirably, but you also helped her capture a Nether Warlock. I think it's time to help you achieve the Count rank.\"\n\nPingchao trembled all over, an unconcealed gleam of excitement flashing in his eyes. He knelt down with a thud, prostrating his upper body on the ground, his voice trembling slightly as he said, \"Your Majesty the Queen, I...\"\n\nThe woman snorted, \"That's enough. I just want you to know that as long as you serve me and the Evil Lord well, we will not shortchange you. You have only one mission: as my servant, you only need to protect Youyou. If she suffers any harm, then you will have no reason to exist. What I value is your loyalty; otherwise, you wouldn't be where you are today.\"\n\n\"Yes, my esteemed Queen, even if it costs my life, Pingchao will protect the Young Mistress well. I will never disappoint you and the Evil Lord.\" The Count rank, as a servant among vampires, was originally an unattainable dream. However, as the Vampire Queen's servant, it was different.\n\nYouyou giggled, suddenly jumping onto Pingchao's back. \"Mommy, look, have I grown taller? Mommy, Brother Pingchao is very good; please don't scold him anymore.\"\n\nA smile appeared on the woman's face. \"Good girl, Youyou. You're not short anymore, little Youyou! From now on, don't run around recklessly. Be careful of encountering danger, after all, there are still many hypocritical humans you can't deal with.\"\n\nYouyou bounced on Pingchao's back. \"Mommy, I know, don't lecture me anymore. Youyou is very smart, you know.\"\n\nJust then, the person who had been silent all this time, shrouded in black from head to toe, spoke. A cold, low voice resonated from behind the black mask. \"Youyou, this time, you truly did well. Sina, do you know what our daughter brought back?\"\n\nSina said with a hint of surprise, \"Evil Lord, didn't Youyou bring back an energy fragment left by a dark practitioner who cultivated Nether Warlock arts?\"\n\nThe Evil Lord shook his head. \"Of course not. Although the fragment has value, it pales greatly in comparison to what Youyou brought back. Although I don't know why this Nether Warlock became so weak, I can affirm that what Youyou brought back is indeed a true Nether Warlock. Perhaps, even an old friend of ours.\"\n\nSina's eyes widened in even greater surprise. Suddenly, she let out a chuckle, her charming demeanor filled with seductive allure. \"So, our daughter's luck is truly good, isn't it? A Nether Warlock, that's indeed a fine thing!\"\n\nThe Evil Lord said calmly, \"Pingchao, take Youyou down first. Youyou, if what you brought back was just an energy fragment left by a Nether Warlock, it would be suitable as the soul for your demonic artifact. However, what you brought back is an actual Nether Warlock, and using it merely as a soul for a demonic artifact would be too wasteful.\"\n\nYouyou pouted her small lips. \"I don't care, Father, you can't take my thing.\"\n\nThe Evil Lord said calmly, \"You are my daughter. Although this Nether Warlock cannot become part of your demonic artifact, he can become your protector, an absolutely loyal protector. Go down first. Once I've handled everything, I will naturally hand him over to you in another form. The use a Nether Warlock can provide is beyond your imagination. Go.\"\n\nAlthough a bit confused, Youyou still dared not disobey her father's command. She could only jump off Pingchao's back and left the cave with him.\n\nWatching Youyou leave, the Evil Lord said coldly, \"Let me see, is space the friend I imagined?<sup>1</sup> O, eternal darkness that shines everywhere! Heed my command, scatter into the abyss of overwhelming joy,<sup>2</sup> based on my soul, release!\" A circle of eerie green light suddenly emanated from the skull in his hand. The skull in the Evil Lord's hand seemed to come alive, and the entire cave was blackened by this green light, forming a sturdy barrier.\n\nIf, at this moment, a high-level human mage were to witness this scene, they would undoubtedly be so astonished their mouths would hang open. For this was a 10th-tier Dark Defense Magic with simplified incantations. A person who could so easily cast 10th-tier Dark Magic, what immense power would they possess! Far surpassing any Dark Archmage.\n\nThe Vampire Queen Sina seemed to have long grown accustomed to the Evil Lord's power. She smiled slightly and said, \"Yue, let's see.\"\n\nThe Evil Lord's right hand, adorned with a black glove, shot out like lightning and touched the green skull's eyes. Amidst a shrill shriek, a wisp of black mist drifted out from the green skull. Without any hesitation, as soon as the black mist appeared, it immediately darted outwards at top speed.\n\nThe Evil Lord did not move, nor did Sina. The black mist collided with the outer layer of green light and was immediately bounced back, letting out another shriek, much weaker than the previous one.\n\nThe Evil Lord's cold, low voice resonated. \"I advise you to behave yourself. Even as a mere soul, you cannot escape from me, not to mention a Nether Warlock actually still has a body; it just lacks form.\"\n\nA voice filled with both shock and fury rang out, \"Who are you? Since we are kindred spirits, why make things difficult for me?\"\n\nThe Evil Lord said coldly, \"If my guess is correct, you should be one of the four Dark Archmages among the Eight Dark Demons of that era, correct? Who are you? Are you Dark Fiend? Evil Blood? Black Demon? Or Necrosoul?\"\n\nAfter all, Safen had lived for thousands of years. Upon hearing the Evil Lord's words, he gradually calmed down and asked suspiciously, \"How do you know I'm one of the Eight Demons? And who are you? Your aura is deeply hidden; my current energy is insufficient to sense it.\"\n\n\"Back then, you eight caused such a huge commotion. It's a pity that the Black Martial Emperor, a hero of his generation, ultimately met his demise by the Divine Ban. If my guess is correct, you must be the most cunning one, Necrosoul. To think you escaped by transforming into a Lich, I truly must admire you. According to what my subordinate and daughter said, I presume you were sealed within that abyss. It's already quite remarkable that you managed to escape. In your era, I was nothing special; perhaps you wouldn't even give me a proper look. However, thousands of years have passed, and this world no longer belongs to you. Necrosoul Safen, look closely.\"\n\nA layer of dark green aura emanated from the Evil Lord. Amidst flashing light, it enveloped everything around him. The black robe vanished, and an exceptionally handsome middle-aged man appeared before Safen. His skin was so pale it lacked any trace of blood, yet he possessed a pair of dark green eyes. Within his eyes, no pupils could be seen, only two flickering masses of dark green flame. The flames gradually shifted from green to dark red. The eyes formed by the dark red flames appeared utterly wicked.\n\n\"Lich, you—you actually mastered Lichdom? No, this is impossible, absolutely impossible!\" Safen's voice was filled with horror. He truly could not imagine that his former dream had been realized by someone else. He himself, in the past, had been extremely close to the Lich realm. He clearly knew how difficult it was to become a Lich. It was definitely not something that could be achieved in a day, two days, a year, or two years.\n\nThe Evil Lord chuckled softly, the red light in his eyes receding somewhat. \"It's strange, isn't it? Strange how I, a human, could live for so many years and even master the most difficult to cultivate Lichdom. Alas, this is my private matter, I cannot tell you. You only need to understand how powerful I am. Now I give you two choices: one, to pledge allegiance to me by the method of soul dedication through a curse; the other, to become the soul within my daughter's demonic artifact, serving as a Nether Warlock. You should be well aware of the difference between these two situations. I don't need to teach you how to choose, do I?\"\n\nSafen said bitterly, \"So what if you're a Lich? If it weren't for the sudden descent of the Divine Ban back then, I would have already cultivated to the Lich realm. You just had a bit more luck than me. Making me submit is impossible. At worst, I'll choose self-destruction. That's still better than being a servant.\"\n\nThe Evil Lord said calmly, \"Then you can try. Before me, even death would likely be a luxury for you. You are already this weak; dealing with you is too simple for me. If you are willing to submit to me, I can not only help you restore your original abilities, but also grant you a certain degree of freedom. As a Lich, my ambitions are grand. I need someone to help me achieve these goals. How about this? I'll show you something, and then you can choose whether to submit to me. As fellow dark practitioners, I believe our goals should not be too dissimilar.\"\n\nA green hexagram instantly appeared before the Evil Lord. Amidst flashing light, three black bottles gradually emerged from the green hexagram. Each bottle was over a foot tall. Extremely intricate patterns were carved onto the bottles. Due to the extreme intricacy of the patterns, they would be difficult to distinguish without close inspection. Three identical bottles each had a circle of dark green gems inlaid in the center of their bellies. The gems were small, with roughly an inch of space between each pair. Aside from the bottles appearing somewhat somber due to their black color, there was nothing particularly special about them. However, the appearance of the bottles immediately made Safen exclaim in surprise. \"These—are these the Gao Das Sealing Bottles? How are they in your hands? Back then... weren't these what those fellows used to seal the Lost Kingdom...\"\n\nThe Evil Lord said coldly, \"Indeed, they are the Mo'ao Das Sealing Bottles.<sup>3</sup> There should be a total of seven of these bottles, forming the strongest seal in a ten-star formation. Originally, with the power of the gods themselves,<sup>4</sup> the Lost Kingdom was sealed into another dimension. Those so-called gods, due to expending too much energy, most of them fell into a deep slumber and have not awakened even now. Alas, they made a mistake. At the moment the King of the Lost Kingdom was finally sealed, he sacrificed his own life to imprint his curse upon the seven Mo'ao Das Sealing Bottles. The curse was simple, not powerful enough to break the seal, because the King of the Lost Kingdom could no longer contend with the gods at that time. However, he used his life to give the Lost Kingdom one last chance. The curse he placed on the seven Mo'ao Das Sealing Bottles was simple: these ten bottles<sup>5</sup> could never leave the Yangguang Continent. Only then would they have a glimmer of opportunity. After all, the Yangguang Continent is not like the Gods' Continent; anything is possible here. Before the gods entered their slumber, they specifically instructed the mighty Dragon God to guard these seven bottles. The Dragon God then dispatched the Bian lineage Dragon Kings to guard the ten Mo'ao Das Sealing Bottles.<sup>6</sup> I presume you've heard this story before, haven't you? In our era, there was no one who didn't want to find these ten bottles<sup>7</sup> and break the seal of the Lost Kingdom.\"\n\nSafen snorted. \"That's natural. The King of the Lost Kingdom once said, before he initiated his self-destruction curse, that whoever could break the seal and allow them to return to the Yangguang Continent, then that person would become the new master of the Lost Kingdom. However, how could the Seven Great Dragon Kings be easy to deal with? They are all stronger than the last. Back then, we Eight Demons once tried to provoke the giant dragons. However, only Black Martial Emperor, our leader, could defeat a giant dragon, while we were far too inferior. We were eventually forced back by the combined might of the Seven Dragon Kings. That time, Black Martial Emperor severely wounded Kagao Xis, the strongest among the Seven Dragon Kings, which also became the root cause of our later destruction by the gods. It's a pity Black Martial Emperor's strength was still a little short. If he could have dealt with Kagao Xis that day before the other Dragon Kings came to assist, perhaps we would have succeeded. Hmph, don't think that just because you've obtained three bottles, it means anything. The Mo'ao Das Sealing Bottles must be completely assembled, all seven of them,<sup>8</sup> to be effective. Although I don't know how you obtained these seven bottles, I can be certain that you have already attracted the attention of the giant dragons. Do you think this is a good thing? Although you've become a Lich,<sup>9</sup> there have been Liches throughout history. I think your strength can at most be compared to Black Martial Emperor in his prime. I don't believe you can contend with the Seven Great Dragon Kings by yourself.\"\n\nThe Evil Lord listened calmly as Safen finished speaking. With a wave of his hand, the three bottles vanished simultaneously. \"Indeed, no matter how arrogant I am, I am not so arrogant as to believe I can simultaneously contend with the Seven Great Dragon Kings. However, now there is a very good opportunity.\"\n___\n<sup>1</sup> The meaning of \"space\" (空間) here is ambiguous. It might refer to the nature or origin of the captured entity, or possibly be a conceptual space related to the spell.\n<sup>2</sup> \"Abyss of overwhelming joy\" (喜出望外深淵) is an unusual phrase for a dark spell, as 喜出望外 typically means \"overjoyed\" or \"pleasantly surprised.\" This may be a deliberate stylistic choice, or a typo in the original text.\n<sup>3</sup> The name of these bottles, previously referred to as \"Gao Das Sealing Bottles\" (歌奧達斯), changes to \"Mo'ao Das Sealing Bottles\" (默奧達斯) here. This inconsistency is preserved from the original text.\n<sup>4</sup> The original text uses 親眾神之力 (qīn zhòng shén zhī lì), which literally means \"the power of the gods themselves.\" This may be a typo for 傾眾神之力 (qīng zhòng shén zhī lì), meaning \"exhausting the power of the gods,\" which fits the context of gods depleting energy.\n<sup>5</sup> The text states \"ten bottles\" (十支瓶子) but earlier establishes there are \"seven of these bottles\" (七支). This numeral inconsistency is preserved from the original text.\n<sup>6</sup> The text states \"ten Mo'ao Das Sealing Bottles\" (十支默奧達斯封印之瓶) but earlier establishes there are \"seven of these bottles\" (七支). This numeral inconsistency is preserved from the original text.\n<sup>7</sup> The text states \"ten bottles\" (這十支瓶子) but earlier establishes there are \"seven of these bottles\" (七支). This numeral inconsistency is preserved from the original text.\n<sup>8</sup> The original text uses 萊合 (láihé), which is likely a typo for 湊齊 (còu qí), meaning \"to collect/gather all, to assemble.\"\n<sup>9</sup> The original text uses 揀成了 (jiǎnchéngle), which is likely a typo for 練成了 (liànchéngle), meaning \"to have practiced and achieved, to have mastered.\"",

    "content": "「As long as we make good use of this opportunity, we may not be unable to realize our wishes. From what I've discovered, the Ice Dragon King is cultivating alone, but he alone cannot pose a threat to me. So, my next target is him. However, while I can easily defeat him, I may not be able to capture or kill him. Therefore, I need more powerful dark beings to help me. To deal with the Seven Dragon Kings, we must tackle them separately. For each one we eliminate, their overall strength will weaken by a few points.\"\n\nSafen asked with some curiosity, \"I'd like to know what kind of opportunity you're talking about. Do the Seven Dragon Kings have a weakness we can exploit?\"\n\nThe Evil Lord said calmly, \"Of course. Among the Seven Dragon Kings, the strongest are undoubtedly the Dark Dragon King Cajiaoxiusi and the Light Dragon King Dimantidi, that couple. They can be said to be the leaders of the Seven Dragon Kings as a whole. As long as they are present, the Seven Dragon Kings are impregnable. However, the Light Dragon King will soon enter the weakest state of her life; she is about to give birth. At that time, the Dark Dragon King will certainly guard her constantly. Those two are also simultaneously guarding two Modaosi Sealing Flasks. Therefore, if I want to deal with them, I will definitely choose the days when the Light Dragon King gives birth. At that time, by concentrating all my forces, it's very likely I can acquire two Modaosi Sealing Flasks in one fell swoop, and even possibly severely injure a few Dragon Kings. So, I need your help. The stronger the assistance, the greater my chances of success. Once I obtain all seven Modaosi Sealing Flasks, this world will be mine, not only the Yangguang Continent but also the Divine Continent.\"\n\nSafen scoffed, \"What you're thinking is quite good, but the Seven Dragon Kings aren't fools either. When the Light Dragon King gives birth, won't they invite other great dragons to guard them?\"\n\nThe Evil Lord said, \"Of course they will. However, to my knowledge, currently guarding them is only the Space Dragon King Kaodili, the weakest in attack among the Seven Dragon Kings. Even if one or two more Dragon Kings join, this operation will absolutely not be canceled. Once the crystallization of the Light Dragon King and Dark Dragon King is born, who knows what kind of monstrous dragon it will be? If the Seven Dragon Kings use their dragon power to make it grow quickly, then trying to seize the Modaosi Sealing Flasks later... I will face another powerful enemy. The Seven Dragon Kings will become Eight Dragon Kings, and there will be no chance to seize the flasks then.\"\n\nSafen's heart stirred. The ideal envisioned by this Lich before him was indeed grand. If he could truly become the master of this world, what did it matter if he submitted to him? Thinking of this, Safen hesitated for a moment, then continued to press, \"Then aren't you afraid that all the Seven Dragon Kings will gather with the Dark Dragon King? If that happens, with six Dragon Kings united, we couldn't possibly be their match.\"\n\nThe Evil Lord said calmly, \"I've already thought about that point. But that's impossible. The Seven Dragon Kings' gathering only happens in times of crisis. Not long ago, I sent people to secretly track them and discovered a meeting of theirs in the snowy mountains. However, only five of the Seven Dragon Kings attended, and... there were many unpleasantries between them. Although we kept a distance during observation to avoid detection, making their conversations inaudible, judging from the situation at the time, the Fire Dragon King Jialamantis seemed to have been angered away by the Dark Dragon King Cajiaoxiusi, while the Space Dragon King was only forced to follow the couple by the Dark Dragon King. A simple analysis: among the Seven Dragon Kings, the Fire Dragon King Jialamantis and the Dark Dragon King Cajiaoxiusi were once love rivals. Therefore, it's almost impossible for Jialamantis to help Cajiaoxiusi protect his wife. You and I both understand that the only way to deal with a love rival is modern warfare*—that is, to utterly destroy the other party. I believe that even for a dragon, Jialamantis must harbor such negative emotions in his heart.\" What he said was true; Jialamantis indeed held negative emotions in his heart. With Dimantidi, whom he loved deeply, taken from him, how could he not hate Cajiaoxiusi? Unfortunately, the Evil Lord overlooked one thing: the Fire Dragon King Jialamantis's love for the Light Dragon King Dimantidi. When love surpasses hate, the choice is often the opposite.\n\nAfter a pause, the Evil Lord continued, \"The Ice Dragon King didn't even attend the Dragon King gathering because of his secluded cultivation. As long as we don't provoke him first, he shouldn't have a chance to help the Light and Dark Dragon Kings. And the Wind Dragon King's task is to guard those white people, so he won't appear either. The Earth Dragon King is famously lazy and gluttonous among the Seven Dragon Kings; who knows where he's sleeping now? So, we will only face three Dragon Kings—no, just two Dragon Kings. For this, I am almost 100% certain. What we need to guard against is merely the potential outburst from the Dark Dragon King because he is guarding his wife.\"\n\nSafen thought for a moment and said, \"So, the opportunity is still great. But you are, after all, still too weak on your own. Furthermore, why should I believe that you can completely break the seal after obtaining all seven Modaosi Sealing Flasks? You know, even with seven flasks, breaking the seal isn't that easy.\"\n\nThe Evil Lord smiled, and his powerful evil aura made the weak Safen tremble. Black mist continuously condensed. \"If I didn't have a foolproof plan, do you think I would begin operations against the Seven Dragon Kings? As early as over a thousand years ago, when I first entered the Lich domain, I already began arranging all of this. Sina, show your power.\" The Vampire Queen, who had been listening quietly, let out a charming laugh. A layer of dark red airflow instantly released from her body, and her graceful figure spun lightly. A pair of not-very-large dark red wings appeared behind her. At the same time, her bewitching eyes instantly turned golden. Her body didn't change much, but the dark aura emitted by the Evil Lord was forcibly pushed aside.\n\nSafen was astonished once again. \"Red-Winged Golden-Eyed, you... you are the Vampire Queen? Heavens! So many of our kind still exist on the Yangguang Continent! It seems those so-called gods are in trouble.\" He clearly knew that a Vampire of Prince rank was absolutely a powerful being on par with a Nether Lich. Let alone the Evil Lord, even this vampire herself might be difficult to handle.\n\nThe Evil Lord said calmly, \"Sina is my wife and also my subordinate. To be able to open the Modaosi Sealing Flasks, we underwent a thousand years of gestation and finally gave birth to a Demonic Siren. There are only two ways to open the Modaosi Sealing Flasks: one is by using the fresh blood of a Holy Maiden of God, and the other is for a mage to use the blood of a Demonic Siren. You've already met her; that is our daughter Youyou. At that time, with just seven drops of her vital blood, I am fully confident I can open the Modaosi Sealing Flasks. Furthermore, the dark magic I have cultivated over these years is beyond your imagination.\"\n\nSafen knew it was time for his decision. The Evil Lord had told him so much; if he couldn't give a satisfactory answer, he would likely be destroyed immediately, facing a Lich and a Vampire Queen. He held no illusions in his heart. \"Alright, since it's for the pursuit of the great dark cause, what does it matter if I serve you? In our dark realm, there are no promises, only interests. I believe that as long as I am still useful, you will treat me well. Nether Lich Safen, is willing to pledge loyalty to you.\"\n\nRed light flared in the Evil Lord's eyes. His goal was to truly subdue the Nether Lich before him. Although he had cultivated many capable subordinates over the years, none, apart from his wife Sina, had reached the strength of a Lich. What he needed were powerful beings of the dark world. \"Good, Safen. Welcome to join. My name is Xie Yue. You may call me the Evil Lord, or the Moon Lord. Now, you know what you should do, don't you?\" In the dark world, there were no promises, nor was there trust. Only cursed oaths could ensure Safen's resolve.\n\nSafen hesitated for a moment. For his survival, and to witness the greatness of dark unity, he submitted. The black mist gradually turned purple. He gradually offered up his soul. The entire cavern was filled with a rich dark aura, an intense presence permeating every corner. Only the red in Xie Yue's eyes, the golden in Sina's eyes, and the purple light emanating from Nether Lich Safen could be faintly seen.\n\n...\n\nNian Bing floated lightly to the ground. Looking at the tall courtyard wall before him, he sighed inwardly, trying to recall his memories of this place from his younger years. Now, his greatest hope was that nothing here had changed. His tall figure, set against a golden-red long robe, appeared exceptionally handsome, especially with the subtle noble aura he exuded. The embroidered fire lion on his chest looked extraordinarily majestic.\n\nThe Rong Prince's Estate was heavily guarded, making it almost impossible for outsiders to trespass. Yet, at the main gate of the Prince's Estate, only two people stood guard. Both guards had calm expressions, wearing only ordinary soldier's cloth uniforms, without even armor. However, a large \"Soldier\" character was embroidered on their chests, and on their left shoulders was a small blue lion emblem.\n\nNian Bing recalled his father's past descriptions. The Flame Lion Knight Order not only possessed extremely formidable overall combat capabilities but also very strong individual fighting prowess. Like the Silver Feather Knights, their most basic combat strength was that of a Primary Sword Master-level knight. The Silver Feather Knights distinguished ranks by the color of feathers on their helmets, while the Flame Lion Knight Order distinguished them by the color of the lion embroidery on their shoulders. From lowest to highest, they were white, blue, yellow, red, and gold. Among these, the white lion represented general combat knights of the Flame Lion Knight Order, meaning knights above Primary Sword Master. The blue lion emblem represented Senior Sword Masters. Upon reaching the yellow emblem, one was at least a Grand Sword Master-level knight. The Red Lion Knights were the backbone of the Flame Lion Knight Order; they possessed the strength of a Martial Half-Saint. The highest-level golden lion emblem, apart from the controllers of the Rong family, was awarded to only eight individuals. Among them, five were also Martial Half-Saints, but Magic-Martial Fighters. The Magic Lion Squadron, commanded by these five, had strong combat capabilities and also served as the guard unit for the Flame Lion Magic Order under Prince Rong. The three Martial Saints with golden lions, along with Prince Rong's two younger brothers who were also Archmages, were the five great vice-captains of the Knight Order.\n\nTo use Senior Sword Masters as gate guards, perhaps only Prince Rong could achieve this, aside from the royal courts of various nations. A few days ago, when the Huarong Empire and Qilu Empire jointly attacked the Aolan Empire, Prince Rong dispatched three of his five vice-captains, leading five thousand Flame Lion Knights to rendezvous with the Northern Army Group, deterring the powerful enemy Langmu Empire from making any move.\n\nNian Bing tidied his clothes and strode towards the gate, as if he hadn't seen the two guards. As he approached, the two blue lion guards hastily saluted respectfully, without any obstruction. Nian Bing secretly sighed in relief. Having passed the first hurdle, it would be much easier once inside. Carefully controlling his inner magical power, he stepped purposefully into what was once his home.\n\nThe Rong Prince's Estate covered an extremely vast area, and, like the Huarong Empire's imperial palace, it was a city-within-a-city in Dutian City. Night permeated the air, and the lights within the mansion were not particularly bright. Looking at the familiar scenes, Nian Bing's heart swelled with emotion. He had returned to his former home, but through impersonation. His father's handsome and benevolent face constantly lingered in his mind.\n\nNot daring to linger too long, Nian Bing quickly headed towards his destination. He had already adjusted his mental power; as long as he firmly remembered what he needed, this trip would not be in vain.\n\n\"Rong Bing, did you just go out?\" A surprised voice rang out. Nian Bing's entire body trembled. He naturally knew that Rong Bing was the name of his elder brother. He stopped, maintained his composure from above, and looked in the direction of the voice. He saw an old man walking towards him. He recognized this person: the somewhat gloomy face, the tall figure, and the eyes that contained a sharp glint—all were so familiar to him. Aside from looking a bit older than back then, not much had changed. Back then, he was one of the people most dissatisfied with his father!\n\nForcing down the hatred in his heart, Nian Bing bowed and saluted, saying, \"Greetings, Third Granduncle. Are you going out?\" This old man was precisely Rong Fei, Prince Rong's third younger brother, a Fire Archmage.\n\nRong Fei laughed heartily and said, \"Yes, I'm going out to find someone for a game of chess. That's always been my favorite pastime, your Third Granduncle's! What? Have you forgotten? Have you been tangled up with that girl Yinuo lately?\"\n\nNian Bing gave an awkward smile and said, \"Third Granduncle, you're teasing me. I was just thinking of going to the study to read. Since you're going to play chess, I won't hold you up.\"\n___\n*The term \"modern warfare\" (現代戰爭) is used here metaphorically to describe a fierce, no-holds-barred conflict between love rivals, implying a desire for the complete destruction of the opponent, rather than literal contemporary combat.",

    "content": "Rong Fei patted Nian Bing's shoulder, smiling slightly: \"Kid, work hard. A few days ago, Eldest Brother said you've already entered the Magician realm. Grandfather is truly happy for you. Among the younger generation, you're the most promising. Third Grandfather supports you. In a few days, the Rising Star Magician Competition will begin; you must make us proud! I heard news from the front that Ice God Tower has sent a genius from their younger generation this time, seemingly named Qianhuan Bingyun. If you can beat her, I think your Grandfather will be very pleased.\"\n\nNian Bing meekly agreed, fearful that Rong Fei would spot a flaw. After all, though he resembled Rong Bing in appearance, there were still some differences. For an acquaintance, a careful look would reveal him. Fortunately, it was dark, and Rong Fei didn't linger, leaving the Prince's Manor to find someone to play chess with.\n\nRong Fei left, but Nian Bing found his back drenched in cold sweat. If Rong Fei had discovered his identity, it would be difficult for him to escape in Rong Prince's Manor, a place *full of crouching tigers and hidden dragons*[^1].\n\nHaving been away for over a decade, his childhood memories were somewhat blurry. Nian Bing searched for the path while quickly recalling his childhood memories of the manor. His memory, much stronger than an ordinary person's, played a crucial role. After searching for less than an hour, he finally found his destination. His luck was good; besides encountering Rong Fei, he only met a few groups of patrolling guards and some servants along the way. All of them mistook him for Rong Bing, so naturally, no one stopped him.\n\nThe tall and spacious study was in an independent courtyard. The courtyard was planted with various exotic flowers and rare herbs, and only a narrow path led to the four large rooms in the center of the courtyard. As soon as Nian Bing approached the courtyard, his mental power gave him a warning sign. He quickly used his mental power to scan the surroundings. He detected at least a dozen hidden sentries within this courtyard. Nian Bing knew this was only what he had found, and there were probably many more he hadn't. The study was a vital area of Rong Prince's Manor; outsiders needed a handwritten order personally issued by Rong Prince to enter, aside from the Rong Prince's immediate family.\n\nStepping into the courtyard where the study was located, no one stopped him. However, Nian Bing clearly sensed mental fluctuations from the hidden sentries detectable by his mental power. Had they noticed him? Surely not. Since he had already come, there was no turning back. He calmly walked towards the study. The main door of the study had a red six-pointed star pattern. Nian Bing knew his greatest test was approaching. The guards might not recognize his identity, but entering the study required passing the final checkpoint: the magic array's test. This magic array did not recognize people. Only by knowing the method to activate it could one enter. Nian Bing had known this long ago, but he still came because he had full confidence in his knowledge of magic arrays.\n\nStanding before the door, disregarding the hidden sentries, he fully concentrated his mental power. Like a sharp blade, it directly pierced into the magic array. In that instant, he felt his whole body heat up, and before his eyes, countless magic symbols seemed to dance around him. Every symbol was filled with the aura of fire. The complex structure of the magic array startled Nian Bing. However, though startled, he did not panic. He quickly sorted through the magic array's intricacies, enduring the hot currents that assaulted him wave after wave, mobilizing the aura within his body, and sensing the subtle changes in the magic array. When he finally probed the center of the magic array, he understood what kind of magic array this was. The most important component in the center of the magic array, its array core, was a drop of fresh blood. There was no need to probe further; he could guess that this was precisely his grandfather Rong Prince's blood. The effect of this magic array was for magicians to use this drop of blood as a guide to probe the identity of the newcomer. What could be a more accurate probe?\n\nHaving discovered this, Nian Bing knew he no longer needed to search for a method to activate the array. Without any hesitation, he reached out and pressed the center of the red six-pointed star. Red light instantly burst forth. Nian Bing felt his entire body heat up, and the next moment, he was already inside the study. What a magnificent magic array! It combined three major functions: probing, attacking, and teleportation. It seemed his decision to come and secretly read the magic books was entirely correct.\n\nOutside the study, two hidden sentries were talking. Hidden Sentry A said, \"Brother, I wasn't mistaken just now, was I? Earlier, I remember the Young Prince already went in. How did he change clothes and come back from outside again? Was I seeing things?\" Hidden Sentry B said, \"No, you weren't seeing things; I saw it too. But you know Xiao Wu's temper[^2], and besides, the study is a vital area of our Rong Prince's Manor. Perhaps there's some mystery inside. Maybe the Young Prince used a teleportation array to go out and then changed clothes and came back. Anyway, it was definitely the Young Prince. Moreover, no outsider would be recognized by that magic array except for the Prince's blood relatives! Don't be *a man of Qi afraid the sky might fall*[^3]. Just pay close attention to our surroundings. Although no one might dare to cause trouble here, we still need to fulfill our duties.\"\n\nEntering the study, the scent of paper wafted over him. Nian Bing had been here once as a child, led by his father, but he had no memory of that visit. The rooms within the study were fully connected. There were still some elementary magic books here, all the accumulated effort of the Rong family over many years. All of them were deliberately interconnected. The rows of tall bookshelves made Nian Bing's heart itch with anticipation; these were all treasures that could help him improve his strength! He lunged with a single step to the nearest bookshelf and began checking the titles of the books, searching for what he needed.\n\n\"Oh. Who came in? It's rare for someone to come read at this hour!\" A clear, cold voice came from behind the leftmost bookshelf, making Nian Bing, who had just found a top-tier fire magic spell book, stiffen. At this hour, how could there still be someone in the study? His first action was to put the magic book into his Space Ring, then quickly gather his magic power. Who was here?\n\nAt this moment, Nian Bing felt no fear. After all, having managed to enter the study, he wasn't afraid of being recognized. As long as the other person mistook him for his elder brother, even if they read together, the other person might not discover any flaws. Thinking this, he steadied his mind and turned to the left, saying: \"It's me. Who's still reading here so late?\"\n\nFootsteps sounded. Nian Bing and the unknown person simultaneously walked in one direction. When Nian Bing turned a corner, a tall figure appeared before him. In an instant, Nian Bing and the other person were both stunned, their minds going blank. They stared at each other, neither able to speak. Their identical height, similar appearances, and temperaments made them feel as if they were looking into a mirror. If not for the different colors of their clothes, they might have thought they were seeing an illusion. Standing opposite Nian Bing was a young man in white clothes. Likewise, on his left chest was a golden lion emblem. The two gazed at each other, their initial daze gradually turning into surprise. \"Who are you?\" The three words were spoken simultaneously from both their mouths.\n\nNian Bing had already come to his senses when he uttered those three words. He had never imagined he would meet his elder brother under such circumstances.\n\nA gleam flashed in Rong Bing's eyes, revealing a murderous aura. A fiery light instantly rose around him. With a flick of his left hand, a fireball appeared at his chest. A strange thing happened: the fireball transformed into a large hand, instantly reaching for Nian Bing's face. Nian Bing's reaction was also swift; a similar red light illuminated his body. After a flash of fire, peace returned to the study.\n\nA bitter smile appeared on his face. \"Don't doubt my face; I'm not wearing a mask. Elder brother, twelve years unseen, have you forgotten Nian Bing?\"\n\nRong Bing's entire body trembled. He exclaimed, \"You, you are Nian Bing?\" He scrutinized the young man before him, who was extremely similar to himself in both build and appearance. His heart trembled.\n\nNian Bing knew there was no longer a need to conceal. Otherwise, he would absolutely be unable to leave the study. Since they had already met, he could only choose to face it. He slowly nodded. \"Brother, yes, I'm back. So many years have passed. Are you doing well?\" His heart was slightly trembling, and he tried his best to suppress his agitated emotions.\n\nA flicker of tears appeared in Rong Bing's eyes. He lunged forward, opening his arms. Nian Bing also opened his arms and hugged his elder brother. The two brothers simultaneously felt each other's surging heartbeats.\n\nAfter a long while, Rong Bing released him, grasping Nian Bing's shoulders and carefully examining him. Rong Bing smiled. \"Good lad, you're still so much like me; now even your height is almost the same. Where's Uncle Tian? Did Uncle Tian come back with you? It's truly wonderful that you're back. You rascal, you must have disguised yourself as me to get in, didn't you?\"\n\nNian Bing sadly shook his head, saying, \"Brother, Father didn't come back, and he can't come back anymore.\" From that hug just now, Nian Bing knew that his elder brother's feelings for him hadn't changed. Perhaps *the Rong family's elders*[^4] would consider him and his father traitors and fugitives of the Rong family, but he deeply believed his elder brother wouldn't. This was a blind trust, a trust born of intuition.\n\nA look of shock burst forth in Rong Bing's eyes. \"Nian Bing, what do you mean by this? Could it be that Uncle Tian...\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"You must know about my parents. Eight years ago, Father, to rescue Mother from Ice God Tower, went up to Ice God Tower with me without hesitation. But in the end, only I escaped. It's been eight years; Father and Mother have been deceased for eight years.\" As he spoke, his eyes reddened, and tears streamed down his face. The emotions he had suppressed for many years finally broke free when facing a relative. Tears fell as his body trembled, and the study was filled with an aura of sorrow.\n\nRong Bing[^5] looked at Nian Bing somewhat dazedly. Although Nian Bing had only given a simple account, he could feel how much suffering his younger brother had endured these past years. Without parents, how had he managed to live?\n\nYears of independence had taught Nian Bing strength. Wiping away the tears from his face, he looked at Rong Bing and said, \"Brother, I won't hide it from you. I only came here today to secretly read the magic books in the study, but I didn't expect to meet you. It seems everything is destined. Don't worry, I won't make things difficult for you. If you still consider me your younger brother, then don't stop me from leaving, alright?\"\n\n\"No.\" Rong Bing firmly grabbed Nian Bing's arm. \"Nian Bing, how can you just leave like this? You are a member of the Rong family! This is your home; don't go anywhere.\"\n\nNian Bing let out a bitter laugh. \"Home? Will anyone still consider Father and me members of the Rong family? Even if so, it's probably just you and Eldest Uncle. Elder brother, I don't want to bring you trouble.\"\n\nRong Bing gripped Nian Bing's hand tightly and said, \"Perhaps no one recognizes you now, but yes, one day, I will let everyone know that you are my younger brother, a part of the Rong family.\"\n\nListening to Rong Bing's firm voice, some of *the rigid notions of the past*[^6] in Nian Bing's eyes disappeared. \"Brother, do you mean that Rong Prince has already designated Uncle Yue as his successor?\" Ever since he was driven out of the family, Nian Bing no longer had a grandfather in his heart. His memories of his grandfather were only of strictness, never kindness. He still deeply remembered how Father angrily cursed Father and himself. From the day he left the Rong family, he no longer acknowledged himself as a member of the Rong family, nor did he acknowledge Rong Prince as his grandfather. Rong Prince's successor had always been a mystery. After all, whether it was Rong Prince himself or his two younger brothers, they all had numerous descendants, and not a few outstanding ones. How difficult it was to choose a successor from among them!\n\nRong Bing nodded: \"Two years ago, Father already confirmed that after his passing, Father would inherit the position of Prince. Father often says that in truth, his talent is not as good as Uncle Tian's. If Uncle Tian were still here...\"\n\nNian Bing stopped Rong Bing from continuing. \"Brother, everything is in the past now. Please congratulate Eldest Uncle for me. Don't tell anyone I was here, alright?\"\n\nA trace of sadness appeared in Rong Bing's eyes. \"Nian Bing, do you really want to leave? Father's status in the family is already very high now. Uncle Tian is gone. Perhaps if Father and I suggest it, Grandfather[^7] will allow you to come home again? After all, Rong family blood flows in your veins! Stay.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, a cold, sharp glint flashing in his eyes. \"Brother, you must understand, I don't need anyone's charity. Even if I stay, what then? To be ostracized like before? I won't stay. However, one day, I will prove everything with my own abilities. I will make Grandfather regret this. I must avenge my parents.\"\n\nRong Bing released Nian Bing's hand. He knew Nian Bing was right. Even if Rong Prince agreed to Nian Bing's return, among the Prince's children and grandchildren in the family, he would absolutely be the least valued and would only be ostracized.\n\n---\n[^1]: *Full of crouching tigers and hidden dragons* (藏龍臥虎, cáng lóng wò hǔ): A Chinese idiom literally meaning \"crouching tiger, hidden dragon,\" used to describe a place or organization where there are many hidden talents or formidable individuals.\n[^2]: *Xiao Wu's temper* (小五一斧脾氣, xiǎo wǔ yī fǔ pí qì): \"Xiao Wu\" is likely a nickname. The phrase \"一斧脾氣\" (yī fǔ pí qì) literally means \"one axe temper,\" implying a quick, decisive, or stubborn nature.\n[^3]: *A man of Qi afraid the sky might fall* (杞人憂天, qǐ rén yōu tiān): A Chinese idiom used to describe someone who worries unnecessarily about something that is highly unlikely to happen.\n[^4]: The original text contains \"融家的加價\" (róng jiā de jiājià), meaning \"the Rong family's price increase,\" which is a likely typographical error. Based on context, it has been interpreted and translated as \"the Rong family's elders\" (融家長輩, róng jiā zhǎngbèi) to preserve the narrative intent.\n[^5]: The original text uses the name \"融閔\" (Rong Min) here, which is likely a typographical error and has been translated as \"融冰\" (Rong Bing) for narrative consistency, as Rong Bing is Nian Bing's brother and the character involved in the immediate preceding and succeeding dialogue.\n[^6]: *Some of the rigid notions of the past* (念冰眼中的歷史人物消失了一些, niàn bīng yǎn zhōng de lìshǐ rénwù xiāoshī le yīxiē): Literally \"some historical figures in Nian Bing's eyes disappeared.\" This is an unusual and somewhat ambiguous phrase. It likely signifies a shift in Nian Bing's perception or emotional state, perhaps his long-held resentments or a hardened view of his family's past began to soften due to the emotional reunion.\n[^7]: The original text uses \"爸爸\" (bàba, father) here, but given the context of authority over returning to the family and the previously established power structure of the Prince's Manor, Rong Bing is likely referring to the current patriarch, the Prince (Nian Bing's grandfather), as the ultimate decision-maker. This translation prioritizes the narrative consistency of who holds the authority.",

    "content": "Staring directly into Niàn Bīng's eyes, Róng Bīng calmly said, \"Niàn Bīng, ever since you left back then, I started wearing white, because I remember, you like white. Today you came wearing red, although it was to disguise yourself as me to enter the manor, but I know, you haven't forgotten me, your older brother. I don't want to say anything else, I just want to tell you, I still remember the promise we made as children.\"\n\nNiàn Bīng's whole body trembled, tears once again flowed unrestrained, and he fiercely embraced his older brother. Róng Bīng's words warmed his heart; he knew that everything from their childhood hadn't changed, everything was so real. After a long while, Róng Bīng pushed Niàn Bīng away. \"Brother, you must remember, if you want to avenge Uncle Tiān and Auntie, you must become strong. As long as you need me, I will definitely help you.\"\n\nNiàn Bīng took a deep breath, a trace of a smile appearing on his face. \"Brother, I will remember your words. You will always be my good older brother. I have to go now. If anyone else comes to the library, I won't be able to leave.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Róng Bīng called out, stopping Niàn Bīng who was about to leave. He quickly walked behind the bookshelf, picked up a thick tome, and handed it to Niàn Bīng. \"These are my research notes on magic from over the years. Perhaps, they might be of some use to you. Niàn Bīng, what kind of books did you intend to look for this time?\"\n\nNiàn Bīng was startled for a moment, but he still accepted his brother's kind gesture. He took out the book he had previously retrieved from his Space Ring: \"I was originally looking for some high-tier magic spells and books about ancient magic arrays.\"\n\nRóng Bīng nodded and said, \"Since you don't want to expose your identity, then you should leave first. Tell me where you're staying, and I'll come find you in a few days.\"\n\nNiàn Bīng stated his address, carefully put away the thick magic notes, and left the library under Róng Bīng's watchful gaze.\n\nWalking out of the study. Breathing the night air, Niàn Bīng suddenly felt his whole body become incredibly clear. His suppressed emotions seemed to vanish in his embrace with his older brother. Róng Bīng's words greatly warmed his heart, letting him know that there were still relatives in this world who truly cared for him.\n\nWalking slowly outwards, feeling the warmth within his chest, Niàn Bīng's hidden, ice-cold heart was gradually melting.\n\n\"Ah! Young Prince, you're here! I had a hunch you'd be in the study. That's great, the Prince is looking for you. Please come with me quickly.\"\n\nNiàn Bīng looked up and saw a Red Lion Warrior standing before him, smiling at him. It couldn't be such a coincidence, could it? Was this good luck or bad luck?\n\nThe Red Lion Warrior appeared to be in his forties and seemed quite familiar with Róng Bīng. Without waiting for Niàn Bīng's reply, he pulled him and walked towards the deeper parts of the manor. If the Róng Imperial Prince summoned, and it were his older brother, there would be no reason not to go. The Róng Imperial Prince was the patriarch of the entire Róng family. No one dared to disobey his orders.\n\nNiàn Bīng's previously relaxed heart tensed up again. As he walked, he mentally calculated how to deal with the Róng Imperial Prince. Now he only hoped that the Róng Imperial Prince was dim-sighted enough not to see that he wasn't Róng Bīng.\n\nSoon, the Red Lion Warrior led Niàn Bīng to a large building. Niàn Bīng recognized it: this was the main house of the Prince's Manor, and also the Róng Imperial Prince's personal study. Furthermore, it was a vital military stronghold of the Huáróng Empire; who knew how many strategic decisions were made here.\n\n\"Alright, Young Prince, you can go in yourself. I'll be leaving first. His Highness the Prince seems to be in a bad mood today. You should be careful.\" After speaking, the Red Lion Warrior winked at Niàn Bīng and turned to leave.\n\nStanding outside the Róng Imperial Prince's study, Niàn Bīng was stunned for a moment. Go in? Or not go in? He hadn't seen him in over a decade, did he really have to go in? At this moment, he had forgotten his own safety; what filled his mind were the intertwined emotions of kinship and hatred.\n\nJust as Niàn Bīng was hesitating, a robust and profound voice came from inside the room. \"Is that Bīng'er? Why aren't you coming in after reaching the door? Does Grandpa have to invite you in? As an excellent mage, mental fortitude is very important, yet you seem quite uneasy. Have you perhaps made some mistake recently?\"\n\nIt was him. Hearing that long-unheard voice again, Niàn Bīng couldn't help but feel a rush of emotion. The Róng Imperial Prince's voice lacked the sternness he remembered from his childhood. His voice was as if it pierced his spiritual world, every word bringing a sense of shock.\n\nPushing the door open, he entered. The room was brightly lit. The vast room was simply furnished; besides a few potted green plants, there were only a desk and chairs. Behind a massive desk sat an old man clad in a fiery red mage's robe. His beard was snow-white, and though seated, one could still feel the extraordinary aura emanating from his tall frame. His pair of black eyes were filled with profound light, completely devoid of the murky, dull yellow seen in ordinary elderly people.\n\nFeeling that gaze, like cold lightning, Niàn Bīng unconsciously lowered his head. After a slight hesitation, he respectfully said, \"Grandpa, did you need me for something?\"\n\nThe Róng Imperial Prince looked at his grandson standing before the desk, his gaze flickering several times. Suddenly, as if he realized something, a strange glint appeared in his eyes. However, the strangeness lasted only a moment before disappearing. He calmly said, \"Bīng'er, have a seat first.\"\n\n\"Yes, Grandpa.\" Niàn Bīng called out \"Grandpa\" without much emotion. He walked to a chair beside the desk and sat down.\n\nThe Róng Imperial Prince said, \"Bīng'er, don't you usually like to wear white? Why did you change to red today?\"\n\nNiàn Bīng's heart rate quickened slightly, but he understood that in front of a powerful individual like the Róng Imperial Prince, any lapse in his mind would easily lead to him being recognized. He hurriedly regulated his mental power, trying his best to relax his body. Only then did he reply, \"Always wearing white clothes is simply too monotonous, so I changed to red today. I remember, don't you like red the most?\"\n\nA rare smile appeared on the Róng Imperial Prince's face, and the red mage's robe with gold trim on his body subtly trembled. A faint hint of melancholy appeared in his profound eyes. \"Red is indeed very good. Red symbolizes the flames we possess, and at the same time, it symbolizes passion, boldness, and vitality. Bīng'er, you are the most outstanding person among the younger generation of the Róng family. To reach the Archmage realm at less than twenty years old, while certainly related to the family's help, your own efforts are the most important. Today I called you here to ask you a few things.\"\n\nNiàn Bīng nodded and said, \"Grandpa, please ask.\"\n\nThe Róng Imperial Prince calmly said, \"I received news. The mages sent by the Ice God Tower to participate in this Rising Star Mage Competition are exceptionally outstanding. What are your thoughts on this?\"\n\nIn an instant, strong confidence burned in Niàn Bīng's eyes. \"No matter how strong the dwarves are, for me, there is no reason to fail.\"¹\n\n\"Is that all?\" A trace of majesty appeared in the Róng Imperial Prince's eyes.\n\nNiàn Bīng didn't answer, merely nodded firmly. Indeed. In his heart, the thought of failure no longer existed.\n\n\"Good. Truly worthy of being my grandson.\" The Róng Imperial Prince nodded with deep meaning in his eyes.\n\nAt this moment, Niàn Bīng's mind had gradually regained its composure. He looked up at the Róng Imperial Prince. This time, he finally saw his grandfather clearly after twelve years. His first feeling was that he had aged. After twelve years, his originally streaked beard had turned snow-white. Although the Róng Imperial Prince's eyes were still as sharp, the wrinkles on his face could not hide the traces of time's vicissitudes. Grandpa had grown old.\n\n\"Hmm, Bīng'er, I like the look in your eyes now. I haven't seen you in a few days, and your mental power seems to have improved quite a bit!\"\n\nNiàn Bīng smiled faintly and said, \"This is all thanks to Grandpa's excellent guidance.\"\n\nThe Róng Imperial Prince said, \"I called you here today not only to ask about your attitude towards the competition, but also to pass something on to you. I hope you can wear it to participate in this Mage Competition. However, to obtain it, you must pass my test.\"\n\nNiàn Bīng was startled for a moment and said, \"A test? Grandpa, don't you already know my strength? There's no need for a test, is there?\" Although Niàn Bīng was confident that he also possessed the strength of an Archmage, he was not purely a fire-attribute mage after all. If he truly had to confront a powerful Archmage like the Róng Imperial Prince, he would likely expose himself very easily.\n\nThe Róng Imperial Prince shook his head and said, \"No, to obtain this item, a test is naturally required. I've taught you since childhood that there's no such thing as a free lunch in this world. Come with me.\" After speaking, he lightly pressed something on the desk. With a grinding sound, a crack about five and a half feet wide appeared in the floor where Niàn Bīng had previously stood in front of the desk, revealing bluestone steps leading directly deep underground.\n\nSeeing this secret tunnel, Niàn Bīng secretly sighed to himself. If he hadn't disguised himself as his older brother, he probably would never have known the secrets within the Róng Imperial Prince's manor in his entire life.\n\nThe Róng Imperial Prince walked out from behind the desk. His height was slightly shorter than Niàn Bīng's. However, as he passed in front of Niàn Bīng, he was like a towering mountain, exerting immense pressure on Niàn Bīng. Ever since his confrontation with Elder Fèng Kōng of the Phoenix Clan, Niàn Bīng had not feared Archmages. He wasn't afraid of how strong the Róng Imperial Prince was; however, at this moment, what he feared most was exposing his identity.\n\nThe Róng Imperial Prince descended the steps, and Niàn Bīng could only steel himself and follow. The steps were very long. Wherever the Róng Imperial Prince passed, two flame-like lamps would light up on the walls every ten feet apart.\n\nThe Róng Imperial Prince didn't speak, and Niàn Bīng wouldn't speak either. As the saying goes, \"the more one talks, the more one errs.\" Although his voice was very similar to Róng Bīng's, there were still subtle differences.\n\nAfter descending for about a hundred meters, the steps disappeared. The Róng Imperial Prince led Niàn Bīng along a narrow, long passageway into the depths of darkness. Niàn Bīng controlled his aura, managed his turbulent emotions, and constantly thought about how to deal with the situation he was about to face.\n\nFinally, the end of the passageway was reached. This was a spacious hall. A square hall, about fifty-five feet high and approximately eleven hundred feet in side length. The entire hall was constructed from hard stone. Niàn Bīng took a deep breath. How many people would it take to construct such an underground hall! Furthermore, he sensed a magical aura within this hall; no need to ask, there was definitely an extremely powerful magic seal here, an oppressive seal. Within this hall, magic elements became very sluggish. Although the air wasn't stuffy, Niàn Bīng, as a mage, felt a sense of oppression.\n\n\"You should be very familiar with the situation here. When you first began cultivating magic, you spent three years here, and those three years laid a strong foundation for you. Although the magic elements here are sparse, under the effect of the magic array, the magic elements are very uniform and pure, completely unaffected by any external impurities. Come, let me see your strength.\" The Róng Imperial Prince walked to the center of the hall and stopped. Beneath his feet was a massive red Magic Hexagram, about thirty-three feet in diameter.\n\nNiàn Bīng looked at the Róng Imperial Prince. He simply didn't know how to launch an attack. Did he really have to fight? He somewhat doubted his own thoughts. \"Grandpa, I am your junior, how can I attack you?\"\n\nThe Róng Imperial Prince smiled faintly and said, \"Now you are the student, and I, your examiner. There's nothing that cannot be attacked. Go ahead and do your best. If you cannot pass my test, I will not only revoke your qualification to represent the Huáróng Empire in the competition, but also confine you here for three months. For your freedom, strive hard yourself. You should know that under these circumstances, I will absolutely not hold back.\" Flames surged around the Róng Imperial Prince's body. The red fiery glow brought immense heat, causing the temperature of the entire underground hall to gradually rise. Fire elemental particles in the air rapidly condensed towards the Róng Imperial Prince; with every bit more that condensed, the flames around the Róng Imperial Prince's body grew stronger.\n\nWith a silent sigh, Niàn Bīng knew he couldn't avoid acting. What he could do now was to complete the test without the Róng Imperial Prince discovering his true identity. Thinking of this, Niàn Bīng's expression became calm. As an excellent mage, calmness was absolutely the most crucial thing.\n\nFlames also surged around Niàn Bīng's body. Although not as imposing as the Róng Imperial Prince's, the scorching flames' speed in seizing fire elements was by no means slow. Niàn Bīng's surroundings gradually turned fiery red. He extended his right hand flat, and a fireball suddenly appeared in his palm. The fireball continuously transformed as fire elements condensed, and its aura constantly strengthened with its increasing size.\n\nThe Róng Imperial Prince nodded and said, \"Good, simplifying complexity is indeed a good method. I'll see what you can turn that fireball into.\"\n\nNiàn Bīng smiled faintly and said, \"Then just wait and see. I definitely won't disappoint you.\" He clearly understood that since the Róng Imperial Prince had told him to attack, he would give him ample time to condense his magic power. Since that was the case, everything became much easier. Although a single fire-attribute magic might not reach the Archmage level, his advantage lay in his mental power.\n***\n¹Translator's Note: The term \"矮人\" (dwarves) is used here. In this context, it may refer to the mages from the Ice God Tower, implying their robust build or perhaps that the Ice God Tower employs actual dwarves in its ranks.",

    "title": "Chapter 98: Confrontation·Nian Bing and the Prince of Song (Part 1)",
    "content": "The fireball in Nian Bing’s hands grew larger and larger. Gradually, its volume exceeded two feet, and the surging fire elements continuously made whooshing sounds. Nian Bing had by now raised it above his head, and the heat around his body was constantly intensifying.\n\nThe Fireball Spell was merely a second-tier magic. For a Magus, it was a spell that required no chanting. However, what Nian Bing was now condensing was no longer a simple second-tier magic. Using low-tier magic methods to condense the magic power required for high-tier magic was what Prince Rong called \"Simplifying the Complex.\" Since Prince Rong wanted to test him, Nian Bing decided to rely solely on magic power.\n\nWhen the fireball’s volume increased to three feet, its size stopped growing. The Fireball Spell itself was a very stable low-tier magic, but with Nian Bing condensing such a massive amount of fire elements using this spell, how could it remain stable? No one would doubt that this enormous fireball, with a diameter of three feet, could explode at any moment. But what Nian Bing did next startled Prince Rong.\n\nThe giant red fireball, held by Nian Bing, gradually began to change. Instead of continuing to enlarge, it started to shrink. The first part to shrink was the outermost ring of flames. The fireball, which had originally radiated brilliant light, immediately dimmed considerably, and the entire fireball changed from red to dark red.\n\nPrince Rong let out a soft exclamation. He was surprised to find that Nian Bing’s blue eyes were now covered with a layer of white glow. As a Magus, he naturally knew that this only happened when one’s mental power reached a certain level. A smile appeared on Prince Rong’s face as he muttered to himself, \"Kid, it seems I underestimated you. Your mental power is actually so strong.\"\n\nYes, what Nian Bing was using now was indeed his immense mental power. After the fireball grew huge, it was indeed extremely unstable, yet he dared to use his mental power to compress it, showing how confident he was in his mental power. The cultivation over many days had not been in vain; both his magic power and mental power had made significant progress.\n\nAfter its color change, the dark red fireball began to compress. Each time it was compressed a bit, the fireball would pause, then continue compressing. The white glow in Nian Bing’s eyes grew more and more intense. His mental power had been pushed to its limit. What he had to do was no longer just compression; at the same time, he also had to effectively control the fire elements inside the fireball, even arranging their precise alignment. Otherwise, if this massive fireball exploded, the first one to suffer would be himself.\n\nThe fireball continued to shrink. Nian Bing was full of confidence. At this moment, he was not only dealing with the test before him. Deep down, there was also a subtle desire to win. He wanted to show this grandfather, who had been harsh to him and his father, that he was not a useless person.\n\nWhen the huge fireball shrank from three feet in diameter to two feet, its color changed again. A layer of deep blue flame appeared on the surface of the dark red fireball. The flame was small but clearly present. The space within three *zhang* around Nian Bing’s body had already become somewhat distorted due to the high heat, and the fireball Nian Bing was continuously shrinking was gradually developing towards blue.\n\nPrince Rong watched Nian Bing in astonishment. He still wouldn’t stop? He wanted to keep compressing it? Had his mental power perhaps reached the realm of a Magus? At this point, he suddenly realized a problem. He stopped merely watching and began to silently chant a spell. After all, facing such a massive fireball of unknown power, even a powerful individual like Prince Rong dared not show the slightest contempt.\n\nFinally, the fireball turned completely blue. Looking at the blue fireball in his hand, even Nian Bing himself found it a bit hard to believe. However, he knew that this was all his mental power could accomplish. From three feet in diameter to one foot, having condensed such a massive amount of fire elements, if he were to compress it further, his mental power would likely struggle to bear it.\n\n\"Grandpa, you’d better be careful,\" Nian Bing warned Prince Rong, and then the fireball flew out of his hand.\n\nThe fireball did not attack in a straight line, but instead drew a graceful arc in the air and descended towards Prince Rong’s head.\n\nLight burst forth from Prince Rong’s eyes. His spell seemed to have also been completed. The flames around his body instantly changed from red to dark blue. The flames rapidly condensed before the fireball arrived. Amidst a dragon’s roar, they transformed into a blue flame dragon, fifteen feet long, soaring to meet Nian Bing’s compressed fireball.\n\nOf course, Prince Rong’s magic was not yet finished. As one of the continent’s most outstanding fire elemental magicians and the First National Preceptor of the Huarong Empire, how could his strength be limited to just this? As the first blue flame dragon charged towards the compressed fireball, a second fire dragon was also rapidly condensing. At the same time, blue flames formed a blue flame barrier around his body, isolating him from external energies. The second fire dragon also took flight, meeting the fireball from another direction, though its forward speed was much faster. As the first blue flame dragon was about to make contact with the fireball, the second fire dragon arrived simultaneously.\n\nNian Bing certainly didn't want his painstakingly condensed fireball to be destroyed just like that. He immediately reacted. The fireball, which had been flying in an arc, suddenly descended sharply, as if a meteorite, plummeting towards the ground. The two fire dragons rapidly pursued it. Just as the fireball was about to hit the ground, it suddenly flew low, skimming the surface, swaying left and right to divert the two fire dragons, and then suddenly accelerated, heading towards Prince Rong.\n\nPrince Rong praised, \"Good, truly my grandson! Let's have a grand show of 'Two Dragons Snatching the Pearl'!\"* As he spoke, he lightly gestured with his right hand in the air. Nian Bing witnessed a strange scene: one of the two fire dragons instantly expanded to its limit, almost filling a third of the entire hall, engulfing Nian Bing's fireball. The other fire dragon then directly plunged into the first fire dragon’s body and, before Nian Bing could react, had already caught up to his fireball.\n\nIt was too late to break free. However, Nian Bing would not allow the energy of the two fire dragons to devour his compressed fireball. Even if it was to explode, he would find the best timing. The fireball moved with lightning speed, without any specific target, its movements chaotic, yet it created a series of afterimages within the first expanded fire dragon. Just as the second fire dragon blindly pursued the fireball, a white light suddenly burst forth from Nian Bing’s eyes.\n\nBoom—!\n\nA tremendous roar shook the entire underground hall violently. The four walls, the floor, and the hall ceiling simultaneously emitted intense red light. The violent roar forced Nian Bing to retreat several steps, continuously casting one Fire Wall Spell after another in front of him.\n\nThe entire hall groaned amidst the interweaving red and blue lights. No one could imagine the power generated by that fierce explosion. Everything passed. Nian Bing, his face somewhat pale, fell to the ground. However, thanks to the physique strengthened by Flame Dragon King Galimandis in the past, he had not suffered any harm. Only the shock to his mental power was quite severe.\n\nA smile appeared on Nian Bing’s face. Looking at Prince Rong, who was still standing on the other side of the hall, he knew that he should have passed the test.\n\nThe blue barrier around Prince Rong’s body was still there, but the two seventh-tier fire dragons he had unleashed were blasted to smithereens, leaving not a single trace of flame. Although Nian Bing had consumed a good amount of magic power, it was only equivalent to a single seventh-tier spell. Yet Prince Rong had used two seventh-tier fire dragons, both of which were destroyed by Nian Bing’s highly compressed fireball. From the current situation, Nian Bing had actually gained some advantage.\n\n*Clap, clap, clap.* Prince Rong clapped his hands and said lightly, \"Even if the real Rong Bing were to do it, he could probably only achieve this level. Not bad, very good. Young Magus, how should I address you?\"\n\nNian Bing’s body stiffened. He had no idea where he had revealed a flaw. Suppressing the surprise in his heart, he feigned astonishment and said, \"Grandpa, what do you mean? I am Rong Bing! Don’t you recognize me?\"\n\nPrince Rong shook his head and said, \"It is precisely because I know my grandson that I know you are not him. In fact, I already realized you weren’t him when I first met you. Otherwise, why would I bring my own grandson here for a test when I wanted to give him something? As you said yourself, how could I not understand my own grandson's abilities? However, I must admit, your strength is formidable, so strong that it approaches Rong Bing’s realm. But if you cannot show me strength to contend with me next, your ultimate fate will be to perish here. Fight for honor. I will show no mercy to an invading enemy. It’s been a long time since I’ve had some activity, and having a Magus as an opponent, I think, is quite good.\"\n\nNian Bing stood up. He knew that whatever he said now, Prince Rong would not believe he was his grandson, Rong Bing. So be it. Was he afraid? The grievances he and his father suffered in his childhood instantly erupted. A hateful light shot out from his eyes, and Nian Bing’s voice turned very cold, \"Prince Rong is indeed Prince Rong; you actually discovered it. However, I’d very much like to know how you figured out I wasn’t Rong Bing?\"\n\nPrince Rong smiled faintly and said, \"That’s not difficult. First, Bing’er’s clothing hasn’t changed for over ten years; he wears white clothes regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter. Why would he suddenly change? Also, there’s the golden lion embroidery on your chest. Indeed, you embroidered it very well; most people would find it hard to tell. But don’t forget my nickname. As the Flame Lion King, if I couldn't even recognize my own symbol, I would have gained this title for nothing. Now, you should understand, right?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"I understand. If that’s the case, then let's fight.\" Slowly closing his eyes, he felt the turmoil in his heart, as if he had returned to his childhood. He remembered very clearly that almost every time his father took him to see this grandfather, apart from scolding, his grandfather never seemed to show any other emotion. Therefore, every encounter with Prince Rong was what Nian Bing least wanted to do. Today, he finally had to face him again, in an adversarial situation. \"Father, if it weren’t for him, perhaps we could have at least had a home! But since the day I was born, apart from the small hut where you and mother lived, I have had no home. The Rong Family does not belong to me, nor am I a part of the Rong Family. Today, let me abandon everything and fight my own grandfather. Whether the outcome is life or death, it no longer matters.\"\n\nThinking this, Nian Bing no longer concealed anything. He slowly brought his hands together in front of him, and his index fingers of both hands simultaneously drew out. Blue and red lights instantly condensed into two shining triangles. The Ice-Fire Conjoined Hexagram formed in an instant. At this moment, the aura emanating from him changed again; it was a change in light. Blue and red lights simultaneously surged, truly the power of Ice-Fire Conjoined. At this very moment, he displayed his true strength.\n\nPrince Rong looked at Nian Bing in surprise, \"Is that Ice-Fire Conjoined? Young man, not only do you look very much like Bing’er, but you also possess a talent no less than his. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen such strange magic. I feel the urge to fight.\"\n\nNian Bing said coldly, \"Then let your fighting spirit fully unleash. Even if I die, I hope to face the Flame Lion King in his full state.\"\n\n\"Sigh of the Ice Goddess.\" Blue light instantly flared, a speck of blue light in Nian Bing’s hand instantly magnified. With a *ding* sound, the Morning Dew Blade plunged into the ground at Nian Bing’s feet, emitting an exceptionally cold sheen that immediately brought a chill to the otherwise extremely hot hall.\n\nUpon seeing the Ice Goddess Stone, Prince Rong’s face drastically changed. He stared directly at Nian Bing, a hint of anger flashing in his eyes.\n\n\"Roar of the Fire God.\" The red light was no less intense than the blue, similarly plunging into the ground at Nian Bing’s feet, fusing with the Ice-Fire Conjoined Hexagram. At this moment, Nian Bing had cast aside all burdens in his heart. He only wanted to fight, to fight with all his might.\n\n\"Fire God Stone.\" Prince Rong’s red magic robe, edged with gold, suddenly swelled, and the expression on his face fluctuated.\n\n\"That’s right, it is the Fire God Stone. Back then, weren’t you chasing after Rong Tian for it? Good, today I’m returning it. As long as you can kill me, you can reclaim this supreme treasure of the Rong Family.\" Nian Bing’s voice was even colder than before. He did not stop his actions.\n\n\"Whisper of the Free Wind.\"\n\n\"Ever-changing Hexagram.\"\n\n\"Dawn Piercing Heaven and Earth.\"\n\n\"Curse of Eternal Hell.\"\n\n---\n*   \"Two Dragons Snatching the Pearl\" (二龙抢珠) is a Chinese idiom describing two powerful entities or forces competing for a single, valuable object or goal.",

    "title": "Chapter 98: Confrontation·Nian Bing and Rongwei King (Part 2)",
    "content": "Blue, silver, white, and black lights burst forth simultaneously. In the great hall, where magic elements were not particularly active, one could almost hear the cheers of the magic elements—such was the effect of top-grade gemstones. Ao Tian Dao, Xuan Ji Dao, Sheng Yao Dao, and Shi Mo Dao were successively inserted into the Ice-Fire Dual-Origin Hexagram. The six supreme magic blades, shining with different lights, didn't require Nian Bing to chant any spells or deliberately do anything. They naturally formed a layer of misty aura, shielding his body.\n\nNian Bing smiled, his eyes filled with sorrow. \"Prince Rong, back then, my father only took one Flame God Stone. This time, I'm returning six supreme gemstones to you. I think my father's mistake from back then can be atoned for now, can't it? These six gemstones can completely compensate for your kindness in raising him. My father and I have no relation whatsoever with the Rong family. Today, I won't hold back. Although I know I'm no match for you, I still want to fight it out with you. Even if I die, I'll choose to die in battle.\"\n\n\"Ascend, Holy Light that pierces the heavens and earth! You represent endless light, illuminating the earth. Manifest, aura of Holy Light, in the radiance of Ice-Fire Dual-Origin, release your divine splendor! Holy Light!\" Under the effect of Nian Bing's spell, the holy white light on Sheng Yao Dao instantly rose to its peak, illuminating the entire hall as if it were daytime.\n\nHoly Light, this was the Holy Light that purifies all, and one of the rare offensive spells in Light magic, having a doubled attack effect against dark creatures and dark mages. A huge white pillar of light condensed before Nian Bing.\n\nPrince Rong calmly watched the agitated Nian Bing chanting spells. When he realized that Nian Bing was not using Ice-Fire Dual-Origin magic, but an eighth-tier Light magic spell, Holy Light, his face revealed a look of astonishment. He had never imagined that Nian Bing could actually use a third type of magic.\n\nBut what surprised Prince Rong even more was yet to come. Nian Bing's spell chanting didn't stop. The Holy Light, under his mental control, completely enclosed the Ice-Fire Dual-Origin Hexagram. He continued to chant, \"Wind of Freedom, you gently whisper. To friends, you are as warm as a spring breeze; to enemies, you are as harsh as winter. Please lend me the extreme of your harshness.\" The wind stirred. Ao Tian Dao's blue light instantly surged, and the blue blade light broke free of its restraints, shooting straight into the sky. The whisper of the Wind of Freedom, in a moan, stirred the essence of wind. From gentle to fierce, it blew Nian Bing's clothes, making them flap loudly.\n\n\"Solitary Ice, coldness is your nature, hardness is your essence. Please merge your coldness and hardness, and transform into an invincible sharp blade!\" Blue points of light condensed in the fierce wind, forming solid sharp blades. These were not second-tier ice blades, but true frigid ice. The reinforcing ice blades shone with a chilling light—seventh-tier Ice Shatter Rain.\n\nThe purpose of Holy Light was merely to serve as a protective barrier. Relying on this eighth-tier Light magic spell, Nian Bing was confident that he wouldn't suffer significant damage from Prince Rong before his spell was complete.\n\nHurricane Ice Rain. Every time Nian Bing used this spell, he faced Elder Feng Kong, an Archmage at the Martial Saint realm. Although Feng Kong was injured at the time, he was still a Martial Saint, yet he was helpless against Nian Bing's spell.\n\nThe wind began to spin violently, and the solid ice blades were continuously merging with the wind. Hurricane Ice Rain had already begun its prelude to bursting forth.\n\n\"Fire, ice, light, wind. Four types of magic. It seems I truly am getting old.\" A hint of gentleness appeared in Prince Rong's eyes. A red light flashed, and a long-handled magic staff appeared in his hand. His chanting voice was very low, completely inaudible from Nian Bing's side. However, the blue flames surrounding his body had transformed into purple during the continuous low chanting.\n\nTwo mages: one was the continent's top Archmage, while the other was the first human to possess Mimicry magic, capable of controlling six types of magic. What would be the final outcome of their battle?\n\nAo Tian Dao and Morning Dew Blade simultaneously leaped into his hands. Nian Bing moved. Both blades swung forward simultaneously, light suddenly bursting forth. Hurricane Ice Rain fully formed in an instant, passing through the Holy Light in the form of a tornado, heading towards Prince Rong on the other side of the hall.\n\nPurple flames exploded at the tip of the long magic staff—Wall of Fire, yes, a simple Wall of Fire. A wall formed by purple flames moved out horizontally, directly meeting Hurricane Ice Rain, this fusion magic.\n\nA scene that astonished Nian Bing occurred. When Hurricane Ice Rain encountered that purple wall of flames, its power rapidly diminished, while the purple flame wall continuously strengthened under Prince Rong's support.\n\nSuddenly, Prince Rong roared. The purple flame wall instantly ascended to the same height as the great hall, and Hurricane Ice Rain, which had once ensnared a Martial Saint, simply vanished.\n\nNian Bing understood. It wasn't that his magic power had weakened, but that Prince Rong's magic power was truly too strong. The powerful Hurricane Ice Rain was swallowed before it could even unleash its full power. *Is* this the true power of a Fire Archmage?\n\nPrince Rong's eyes glowed brightly. He raised his magic staff high, and the purple flame wall instantly condensed into a giant flame lion, pouncing towards Nian Bing with unparalleled speed.\n\n\"Grandpa, no!\" A horrified voice came from the direction of the passageway. A white figure quickly rushed towards the great hall; it was Rong Bing.\n\nNot long ago, after Nian Bing left the study, Rong Bing's mood constantly fluctuated. Seeing his younger brother again, his excitement was no less than Nian Bing's. Although anxious that Nian Bing had left, he knew he couldn't go out too quickly, otherwise Nian Bing could easily expose his identity. However, he suddenly felt a faint uneasiness in his heart. After Nian Bing had left for a short while, he finally couldn't help but leave the library too.\n\nRong Bing was about to go find his father and tell him about meeting Nian Bing today, but on the way, he encountered the Red Lion Guard who had earlier led Nian Bing to Prince Rong. The Red Lion Guard was extremely surprised to see him, and couldn't help but ask how he had left the Prince's study so quickly. Hearing the Red Lion Guard's words, Rong Bing immediately realized something was wrong. Grandpa was simply too familiar with him; Nian Bing's disguise could never fool him. Without time to think further, Rong Bing immediately rushed at the fastest speed to the secret great hall beneath Prince Rong's study—but how could he not know? However, he was still a step late. Just as he was about to rush out of the passageway and into the hall, he saw the giant purple flame lion pouncing towards Nian Bing.\n\nRong Bing was a Magician, but he was only a mage. How could a mage's running speed be fast? Watching the purple lion charge towards Nian Bing, he had no ability to stop it whatsoever. His mind instantly went blank. No one understood better than him that it was already the power of a Forbidden Spell!\n\nHearing his elder brother's voice, Nian Bing, facing the giant purple lion, suddenly felt a fearless courage rise in his heart. Sheng Yao Dao leaped into his hand, and he plunged his entire being into that fearless sea of flames. At that instant, he not only burst forth with all his magic power, but also all his mental power. On the ground, the red and blue Ice-Fire Dual-Origin magic array floated up gracefully, instantly merging into the Holy Light. For a moment, white, blue, and red lights surprisingly merged completely together in an impossible fashion, merging with Nian Bing's heart. The mixed lights enveloped Nian Bing's body, and also enveloped the Sheng Yao Dao in his hand.\n\n\"Dragon Dance of the Sky!\" A dragon's roar sounded from the enormous three-colored light covering Nian Bing. It was not the sound of one dragon, but the full roar of nine dragons. At that instant, Nian Bing, through the perfect fusion of Ice-Fire Dual-Origin and Light magic, suddenly elevated his attack power to the Archmage realm. Although this was merely a moment of potential bursting forth when facing a threat to his life, it was already enough.\n\nNine giant dragons, entangled with white, blue, and red lights, lunged out simultaneously. The scene of nine dragons galloping covered the entire great hall.\n\nPrince Rong was not intimidated by the sight before him. Watching the nine dragons, the purple lion he controlled suddenly stopped its charge, and the light of the purple flames rose again. That was an absolutely surging divine light, a divine light no one could imagine.\n\nThe nine dragons were swallowed one by one. Even if Nian Bing reached the Archmage realm, the gap in power was still there after all. How could he break through the power of a Forbidden Spell?\n\nRong Bing knelt on the ground in despair and closed his eyes. Tears streamed down his face. Without even looking, he knew Nian Bing couldn't defeat Grandpa.\n\nThe great hall gradually quieted down, and all kinds of complex lights gradually disappeared. Prince Rong was suddenly astonished to find that only five shining blades remained across from him, and Nian Bing himself was gone. His heart shook. He suddenly turned around. The giant purple flame lion also arrived by his side.\n\nIndeed, Nian Bing was half-kneeling behind him, constantly gasping for breath. His recently bought gold-red robe was damaged in multiple places, his face frighteningly pale, and large drops of sweat rolled down his forehead. The extreme overexertion of his magic and mental power had sent him into a semi-conscious state. In his hand, he clutched a strange silver blade with six sharp, gleaming edges.\n\nPrince Rong felt his heart skip a beat. If Nian Bing's power were a bit stronger, what would happen if he still had stamina when he got behind him? He shook his head with a bitter smile; he somewhat dared not imagine. However, if he had attacked with full force earlier, Nian Bing probably wouldn't have been able to get behind him. Space magic—this must be the fifth type of magic he's used. Kid, how many more surprises do you have for me?\n\nWith a thud, Nian Bing, who had been struggling to hold on, finally couldn't sustain himself and collapsed to the ground, unconscious. But his hand still tightly clutched Xuan Ji Dao. When the first dragon touched the purple flame lion, he already knew he couldn't resist. So, he wisely chose to escape. And the best way to escape was naturally Space magic. In the instant the last three dragons burst forth, he abandoned Sheng Yao Dao and chose Xuan Ji Dao, using the moment the light blinded eyes to activate short-range teleportation. Originally, he wanted to teleport himself outside, but he forgot that there was a powerful seal within this underground great hall. Therefore, the short-range teleportation magic, by an unforeseen twist of fate, sent him behind Prince Rong, leading to the previous scene.\n\nEverything returned to calm. Rong Bing slowly opened his eyes. The first thing he saw were the five divine blades at Nian Bing's previous location, and only then his grandfather.\n\n\"Grandpa, he's Nian Bing! He's your grandson too! Why did you want to kill him?!\" Rong Bing's voice was filled with sorrow.\n\nPrince Rong said calmly, \"Facing enemies, I've always been iron-blooded and ruthless. But even a tiger doesn't eat its cubs. Do you think I would kill my own grandson?\" As he spoke, he turned sideways, revealing Nian Bing unconscious not far behind him.\n\n\"Nian Bing!\" Rong Bing cried out in joyful surprise, rushing to Nian Bing's side at the fastest speed. He lifted his upper body, checking his vital signs.\n\nPrince Rong said calmly, \"Rest assured, he'll be fine. He only fainted from excessive exhaustion.\"\n\nRong Bing let out a long breath. \"Grandpa, I...\"\n\nPrince Rong waved his hand and said, \"Don't say anything more. First, settle him down, then come to the study to find me. I need your explanation.\" As he spoke, with a sweep of his large hand, fiery red light flared, and all six divine blades, including the Xuan Ji Dao in Nian Bing's hand, fell into Prince Rong's grasp.\n\nRong Bing's mood was joyful. At least Nian Bing wasn't dead; that was enough. Carrying his younger brother's body, he followed his grandfather along the passageway back to the study. Following Prince Rong's instructions, he settled Nian Bing in his own room. Only then did he return to the study to see Prince Rong.\n\nWhen Rong Bing returned to the study, Prince Rong was quietly sitting behind the writing desk. On the writing desk before him, six distinct divine blades were neatly arranged.\n\n\"Grandpa, I'm here.\" Rong Bing's mood was a bit apprehensive. Within the Prince's Estate, the only one who could make him fearful was his own grandfather.\n\nPrince Rong said calmly, \"Now you can begin speaking. You should know what I want to hear.\"\n\nRong Bing's heart sank with a silent sigh. Since Nian Bing had already been discovered by Grandpa, there was nothing left to hide. At once, he briefly recounted Nian Bing's sneaking into the study tonight, only omitting the part where he gave the notes to Nian Bing.\n\n\"Are you saying that Rong Tian is dead?\" Prince Rong's expression and tone remained calm, but Rong Bing clearly saw his grandfather's hand, placed on the writing desk, trembling slightly.\n\n\"Yes, Grandpa. Nian Bing said so. He has no reason to lie to me. Grandpa, Nian Bing is already pitiful enough. He finally returned with great difficulty. Over the years, he must have suffered a lot, you...\"",

    "content": "\"Silence!\" Prince Rong coldly shouted, stopping Rong Bing mid-sentence. \"I don't need you to teach me what to do. Alright, you may leave. Tomorrow, after he wakes up, bring him here to see me. If you dare let him out without my permission, I will even deal with you.\"\n\n\"Yes, Grandfather.\" Rong Bing agreed, hesitated for a moment, then sighed softly before turning and leaving Prince Rong's study.\n\nOnly Prince Rong remained in the study. Looking at the six magical blades on the desk, each glowing with various colors, Prince Rong's eyes gradually blurred. \"Tian'er, are you truly dead? Why didn't you return all these years? Don't you understand, back then I was 'hating iron for not becoming steel'!¹ Was that woman truly worth you sacrificing so much?\" In truth, as early as Nianbing entering the study and revealing his flaw, Prince Rong had vaguely guessed Nianbing's identity. With his experience, he could naturally see that Nianbing's appearance was not magically disguised. And his resemblance to Rong Bing naturally made Prince Rong connect some dots. Therefore, Prince Rong led him into the underground hall to test his magic. When Nianbing summoned the Roar of the God of Flame, Prince Rong immediately understood that the person facing him was indeed his grandson, the son of his once most beloved Rong Tian.\n\nHe didn't know how much time had passed. Nianbing slowly recovered from his stupor. Constant waves of pain and dizziness from his brain made him groan aloud. He tried to open his eyes but couldn't exert an ounce of strength, as if his entire body had been hollowed out. *Am I dead?* Nianbing asked himself in his heart. He didn't know that just as his conscious mind was at a loss, a familiar warmth from his chest flowed into his body, nourishing his meridians. *It's the aura of the Heavenly Splendor Tablet. So, I'm not dead yet.* Nianbing was greatly excited in his heart. He no longer delayed his full awakening, re-establishing calmness. He felt the gentle energy bestowed by the Heavenly Splendor Tablet. Focusing his mind and looking inward, he sensed his current physical condition. After a simple observation, Nianbing couldn't think of any other way to describe it besides the two words: 'terrible.'\n\nInside his body, both his mental energy and magical power had reached a state of exhaustion. Nothing was wrong with his body, but the extreme consumption of mental energy had plunged him into his current semi-conscious state. Nianbing knew that if it weren't for the nourishment and protection of the Heavenly Splendor Tablet, he didn't know how long it would take for him to recover consciousness. He was still alive. But he had no idea what was happening outside. The most important thing now was to quickly recover his strength; only then could he deal with everything outside. Thinking this, Nianbing used the energy from the Heavenly Splendor Tablet and lay there, beginning the process of meditation.\n\nMeditating under conditions where both mental and magical power were equally exhausted was undoubtedly a very painful thing. Without a powerful mental pull, the speed of magical power condensation was astonishingly slow. If he didn't fully concentrate to perceive, he simply couldn't detect the slightest trace of magical power seeping into his body. Nianbing wasn't anxious, because he knew rushing was useless. In this situation, he could only recover gradually. While condensing magical power, he recalled in his mind the battle with Prince Rong. The magnificent magical battle didn't last long. However, Nianbing learned many things from Prince Rong. Despite being an Ice-Fire Dual Origin Archmage, capable of using six types of magic, he was so vulnerable when facing Prince Rong's singular magic. Only the compressed fireball at the beginning was barely able to contend with Prince Rong, but after his flames turned purple, even when Nianbing used his strongest spell, he still couldn't block Prince Rong's attack. Was this the gap in power? In the face of an absolute disparity, any technique was useless.\n\nOriginally, before Nianbing used his last spell, he had time to cast that life-sacrificing curse spell. However, before that, he still harbored a glimmer of hope because he still had the Xuanji Blade. Moreover, though he was unwilling to admit it, the enemy he faced was indeed his own grandfather! Therefore, he didn't use the curse magic. In the end, the result of ignoring the barrier was collapsing from exhaustion and falling unconscious.\n\nPrince Rong had merely used a magic staff that was nothing special. Even if its quality was good, it absolutely couldn't compare to Nianbing's Roar of the God of Flame. Yet, the magic he cast was much faster than Nianbing's in terms of speed, and judging by its power, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say it was tenth-tier. To use such powerful magic in such a short time, Prince Rong was indeed worthy of being called the Flame Lion King. But, by extension of his strength, the Priestess of the Ice Snow Goddess had still emerged victorious when facing Prince Rong and his two brothers. Wouldn't the gap between Nianbing and her be even greater? Thinking this, Nianbing couldn't help but feel a little disheartened.\n\nMagical power and mental energy were recovering little by little. As the two different abilities recovered to a certain extent, Nianbing could already feel that, as they mutually supported each other, the speed of his magical power condensation was getting faster and faster. The Ice-Fire Dual Origin magical power connecting his chest and lower abdomen gradually took on a red and blue glow. Looking at the genuine magical elements, Nianbing's heart was filled with a sense of intimacy. He was calling for the condensation of this power, calling out to his companions.\n\nOpening his eyes, Nianbing saw a pure white expanse. It was a spacious, large bed. The bed wasn't soft; on the contrary, it was hard and stiff. He slightly moved his body, and waves of soreness and aching immediately spread through him. His magical power had recovered by thirty percent. He really wanted to see his current situation, so he temporarily stopped meditating and truly woke up.\n\n\"Nianbing, you're awake.\" An excited voice rang out. Before Nianbing could react, someone was already standing by the bed. It was his older brother, Rong Bing.\n\n\"Brother, was it you who saved me?\" Nianbing's heart immediately felt a little calmer upon seeing Rong Bing, and a hint of a smile appeared on his face.\n\nRong Bing shook his head and said, \"No, it wasn't me who saved you. One could say you saved yourself, or that Grandfather couldn't bear to harm you.\"\n\nNianbing's brows slightly furrowed. He said, \"So that means I'm still in the Rong family's home? Brother, is Prince Rong planning to put me under house arrest in the Prince's Residence, just like he did with my father?\"\n\nRong Bing sighed softly and said, \"I don't know. Grandfather just said to bring you to see him after you woke up.\"\n\nNianbing sat up from the bed. With thirty percent of his magical power and mental energy recovered, his body was fine now. He sighed and said, \"The more you don't want to face something, the sooner it arrives.² It seems evasion is useless. Brother. Take me to see him.\" It wasn't that he didn't want to leave here, but he didn't want to cause trouble for his brother who cared about him even more.\n\nA flicker of light appeared in Rong Bing's eyes. Suddenly, he pressed Nianbing's shoulder. \"No, don't go. You should leave. You're right, I think Grandfather is very likely to put you under house arrest.\"\n\nNianbing was startled for a moment, then slowly shook his head and said, \"No, I'm going to see him. What must be faced will always be faced. Even if he really intends to put me under house arrest, it's nothing.\" Although Rong Bing hadn't said it, Nianbing was very clear that if he were to just leave like this, it would definitely bring great trouble to Rong Bing. The Rong family's household rules were extremely strict; no one could violate them and not be punished.\n\nRong Bing said, \"Are you really going to see Grandfather? Nianbing, even if Grandfather was wrong back then, he is our father after all! That day, after you fell unconscious, Grandfather once said, 'Even a vicious tiger won't eat its cubs.'³ Grandfather is old; he no longer has the strictness he had when he was young. If you're going to see him, be careful to restrain your tone and don't provoke him. Promise me, okay? Otherwise, I won't take you.\"\n\nNianbing's eyes flickered. He thought of his father, and the days of his childhood, drifting and wandering in hardship⁴ with his father. Nianbing smiled. \"Brother, I've grown up. I'm no longer a child. I know when to do what. Take me, I think I will talk properly with him. But, from the day my father and I left the Prince's Residence, I was no longer a member of the Rong family.\"\n\nChanging into a set of Rong Bing's clothes, the two brothers stood together, like brothers born of the same mother. They exchanged a glance, and couldn't help but reveal a knowing smile. Rong Bing extended his right hand to Nianbing. \"Nianbing, no matter when, I will always stand by you.\" Nianbing similarly extended his right hand and firmly clasped his brother's hand. Without saying much, his eyes already conveyed a look that Rong Bing understood.\n\nWalking inside the Prince Rong's Residence, Nianbing and Rong Bing's appearance didn't attract anyone's attention because Nianbing was wearing his bamboo hat. When he took the hat from his Spatial Ring, he already knew that the magic blades he relied on were gone; not a single one was left. However, his heart was very calm. About to face his grandfather, he had a feeling of wanting to laugh [missing text]. His father took the Stone of the Flame God, and he brought back six top-grade gems. If his father were still alive, how would he handle everything before him?\n\nThe place where Rong Bing lived wasn't far from the study. The two quickly arrived at this familiar place. Rong Bing gave Nianbing a meaningful look, then stepped forward a few paces and knocked a few times on the door. \"Grandfather, Rong Bing has brought Nianbing to see you.\"\n\n\"Come in,\" Prince Rong's voice sounded very calm, without the slightest emotional fluctuation.\n\nRong Bing pushed open the study door and walked straight in with Nianbing. Prince Rong was still dressed the same way as that day, his red magical robe accentuating his majesty.\n\n\"Grandfather, Nianbing just woke up, so I brought him here,\" Rong Bing said respectfully.\n\nPrince Rong said indifferently, \"You may return first. I want to talk to him alone.\"\n\n\"Grandfather, let me stay,\" Rong Bing said urgently.\n\n\"Withdraw.\" A glint flashed in Prince Rong's eyes. His formidable aura intimidated Rong Bing, making him retreat two steps. He looked up at Nianbing, gave him a cautionary look, and only then did he slowly withdraw from the study. Prince Rong's long-standing prestige was something he dared not offend.\n\nRong Bing closed the study door behind him as he withdrew. Listening to the sound of the door closing, Nianbing slowly took off the bamboo hat from his head. His gaze was calm and cold, looking directly into Prince Rong's sharp eyes.\n\n\"I heard Rong Bing say that Rong Tian is dead,\" Prince Rong said indifferently, looking into Nianbing's icy gaze.\n\nNianbing said calmly, \"Dead. Eight years ago, Father and Mother perished in the Ice God Tower. However, this seems to have nothing to do with you. From the moment we left the Rong family's home, we no longer bore the surname Rong. My name is Nianbing, meaning 'father's longing for mother'.\"\n\n\"Bastard!\" Prince Rong burst into a rage, suddenly standing up. \"Even if he turns to ash, Rong Tian is still a member of my Rong family.\"\n\nNianbing sneered, his eyes filled with sorrow. Although he knew that the powerful Prince Rong before him could kill him at any moment, the emotions suppressed within him could no longer be controlled. His eyes rimmed with red, his body trembled slightly, and he roared with emotion, \"A member of the Rong family? Who ever treated my father and me as members of the Rong family? Back then, if you treated us as members of the Rong family, why did you treat us like that? Just because father fell in love with mother? Just because they gave birth to me? You are a Flame Lion, so you targeted the Ice God Tower. But by what right did you connect all this to the next generation? Father and Mother were so loving, yet you cruelly tore them apart. Mother had me, and finally found Father, but after only a few comfortable days, our happiness ceased to exist. You say we are members of the Rong family? When Father and I were being hunted down by the Rong family's personal guards, was that what you were thinking? When we were wandering the four seas, making homes wherever we could,⁵ where was the Rong family? Home? When Father and I left here that year, we already had no home. You abandoned us long ago, and now you tell me Father is a member of the Rong family? Is it true that only dead people can return to the Rong family? I disdain it! I disdain such a home! Perhaps others think the Rong family is supreme, but in my eyes, it's just a cold prison. There's no family affection, only rigid rules and cold relationships! From when my mother was captured by the Priestess of the Ice Snow Goddess, my father and I lived in the Rong family for six years. Father lived every day in longing for Mother and under the disdainful looks⁶ of so-called family members. Prince Rong, do you know what impression I have of you? In my memories, you never acted like a grandfather. You only had furious roars, roars like a lion. Watching Father grow indifferent amidst your roars, watching Father become more haggard day by day—although I was very young then, I understood that this so-called home simply couldn't accommodate us. I don't admit I'm a member of the Rong family, and even less your grandson. You can treat me as an invading enemy. Kill me if you wish, do as you please. If you want me to acknowledge you as my grandfather, it's absolutely impossible unless my parents are resurrected. I am already an orphan!\"\n---\n¹ **hating iron for not becoming steel (恨鐵不成鋼):** An idiom meaning to be disappointed with someone for not living up to expectations or for not working harder.

    "content": "Nianbing’s words were filled with sorrow, yet each word was so resonant and forceful. His resolute tone brooked no doubt. The grievances endured for years and the patience towards hatred completely erupted at this moment. Nianbing hated the Ice Goddess Priestess because she killed his parents, but at the same time, he also hated Prince Rong. If Prince Rong hadn't opposed his parents’ marriage, at least he and his father would have still had a home! An orphan, yes! Ever since he was ten years old, hadn't he always been an orphan? If he hadn't met his master, he probably would have died long ago.\n\nPrince Rong stood behind the desk, watching Nianbing, watching the tears that had fallen on his face without him knowing when. The anger on Prince Rong’s face gradually faded. He said indifferently, \"If your father were still alive, he would never dare speak to me like that. To be precise, since the day the Huayao Empire was founded, you are the first person to dare contradict me like this.\"\n\nNianbing smiled, took a few steps forward, walked to the desk, and looked into Prince Rong’s eyes, saying, \"I'm not even afraid of death, so what's a few defiant words to you? Do you always think you're never wrong? But, in my eyes, you're just an obstinate old man. If I can survive this time, when I one day possess enough strength, perhaps I won't come looking for trouble with the Rong family.\"\n\nPrince Rong said coldly, \"Are you forcing me to kill you?\"\n\nNianbing said calmly, \"Go ahead and kill me. You have so many descendants, so many subordinates. Killing me won't affect you in the slightest. My magic power is only at thirty percent now, I don't even have a chance to resist. If you kill me, the voice defying you will disappear. I am not my father; Father would only yield before your authority. But I won't. I will fight for my own ideals.\"\n\nPrince Rong said indifferently, \"Do you think dying in my hands like this has any meaning to you? You don't want to avenge your parents anymore?\"\n\nNianbing’s body trembled, and the muscles on his face twitched. Indeed, before coming here, he had already disregarded life and death. However, the moment Prince Rong mentioned his parents’ revenge, his heart was stirred.\n\nPrince Rong said, \"You were right about one thing; I have many descendants, and one more or less like you dying is nothing. However, don't forget, Rong Tian only has you as a son. If you, a magician, cannot avenge your parents, that is unfilial. 'The deceased are heavier than mountains, or lighter than a feather.'¹ Do you think it's meaningful to die in my hands like this?\"\n\nNianbing’s agitated mood gradually calmed. \"So, you're willing to let me go?\"\n\nPrince Rong sat back in his seat. \"Let you go? Yes, I never intended to kill you. Killing you would bring me no benefit. However, if you want to leave the Prince’s Mansion alive, you must pay a price. Nothing can be gained without a price. Present something that can be exchanged for your life's worth, and you may leave.\"\n\nNianbing sneered, saying, \"I have nothing precious enough to exchange for my life. My six most prized blades are all in your hands.\"\n\n\"No, you do.\" Nianbing was surprised to find a hint of a smile on the face of Prince Rong, who he had always considered extremely stern.\n\n\"I do? What is it? How come I don't know?\" Nianbing looked at Prince Rong with doubt.\n\nPrince Rong said indifferently, \"It's simple. I want to know how you can control so many types of magic. I've been immersed in magic for nearly seventy years, and it's the first time I've seen someone able to use so many. The value of this secret is far higher than your life. Of course, I don't want to hear lies. You should understand that lies are useless to me.\"\n\nNianbing stared blankly at Prince Rong. \"It's that simple? You'll let me go just for wanting to know this?\"\n\nPrince Rong said indifferently, \"Do you really want to die?\"\n\n\"No, I don't want to die.\" Nianbing vigorously shook his head. For the sake of avenging his parents, he couldn't die.\n\n\"Then you may begin your account. I'm very interested in your magic. Rong Bing is the successor of your generation whom I've painstakingly cultivated. From the age of four, he began practicing meditation, and his process of learning magic was entirely cutting-edge. Furthermore, he possesses extremely high comprehension and is willing to work hard, only recently reaching the Arch-Magus realm this year. But you, who are a year younger than him, have also reached the Arch-Magus level, and in the versatility of your magic, he cannot compare, especially in the use of fusion magic and control of spiritual power. I want to know how you cultivated.\"\n\nNianbing said, \"Your meaning is, as long as I tell you my cultivation process, I can leave?\"\n\nPrince Rong nodded, \"Precisely. I, Rong Yan, have never gone back on my word. You may begin your account.\"\n\nNianbing said, \"Actually, there's no harm in telling you, because my situation is very difficult to replicate. When I was young, I always followed my father, cultivating fire-elemental magic. Later, after leaving this place, no matter where my father went, he would diligently cultivate, because to save Mother, he had to possess powerful strength. Under Father's influence, my fire-elemental magic continuously improved. Finally, Father couldn't bear it any longer and went to see Mother. However, the power of the Ice Goddess Priestess was something Father couldn't resist. As Father was about to be swallowed by the Ice Goddess Priestess’s magic, Mother broke free from her restraints and joined forces with Father to resist the Ice Goddess Priestess’s magic. They did it for me to escape. Mother gave me the precious Ice Goddess Stone. I used the spatial magic scroll Father had prepared beforehand to escape the scene. At the moment I left, I clearly saw Father's and Mother's bodies consumed by the Ice Goddess Priestess's magic. Later, I was rescued by my first master. When I started cultivating magic again, I discovered that my body no longer contained only fire elements, but also ice elements. Perhaps it's because my parents respectively possessed both fire and ice abilities that I inherited their physiques simultaneously, and the Ice Goddess Stone triggered my ice-elemental physique. From then on, I began to cultivate Ice-Fire Affinity magic.\"\n\n\"No, that's impossible. If you simultaneously possess both ice and fire magic, the greatest possibility is to be consumed by their clash. Who is this first master you speak of? Did he guide you?\"\n\nNianbing shook his head, saying, \"My first master was a great chef. I learned culinary skills from him, not magic. Perhaps Heaven took pity on me, wanting to give me a chance for revenge. I met a fated benefactor, who later became like a mother to me. She gave me a supreme quality jade. When I first faced the clashing of ice and fire, this jade saved my life, allowing me to truly enter the initial cultivation of Ice-Fire Affinity. It was then that my strength began to make significant progress. As for my later growth, it was perilous but ultimately safe. When my Ice-Fire Affinity magic power reached a certain level, I met my second master. He imparted his magical insights to me, and there, I saw many magic books and continued cultivating by combining them with my own comprehension. That's why I said, even if I tell you all these cultivation methods, they would be useless. After all, a person simultaneously possessing both ice and fire physiques is probably one in ten thousand, and someone who can also obtain both the Ice Goddess Stone and the Flame Stone is even more impossible. Coupled with various strokes of luck, that's how I became who I am today.\"\n\nPrince Rong's eyes flickered continuously. Nianbing spoke very simply, glossing over the crucial points. But Prince Rong understood that Ice-Fire Affinity cultivation was by no means simple; one careless mistake and he could be consumed by the magic. Nianbing's body was like a giant bomb buried within, capable of exploding at any moment. And to control this bomb and use it—no wonder his spiritual power was so formidable. \"What about later? How do you explain your other types of magic? Don't tell me you have several physiques too. I've seen people who simultaneously possess three magical physiques, but due to their mutual antagonism, they either die or remain mediocre magicians their entire lives. Yet, I saw five types of magic on you, and each reached rank seven or higher. How do you explain that?\"\n\nNianbing smiled calmly, saying, \"That's even simpler. In fact, what I possess is only Ice-Fire Affinity magic. The other types of magic you saw are not something I inherently possess. Rather, it's by virtue of a mimicry ability, maintaining a subtle balance in my Ice-Fire Affinity magic power, and using those top-tier magic blades to draw out different elemental magics. To be frank with you, I can use not just five types of magic, but even seven elements. It's just that I recently acquired the Demon-Devouring Blade, which represents darkness, and I don't understand dark magic spells very well yet, which is why I haven't used it. All I lack now is an earth-elemental magic blade. If I could obtain it, by utilizing the characteristics of mimicry magic, I would become an all-elemental magician. You don't need to overthink what mimicry magic is; this ability doesn't originally belong to humans. Only my Ice-Fire Affinity can allow magic elements to reach that subtle balance, and then through the magic blades, draw out different elemental magics.\"\n\nPrince Rong snorted coldly, saying, \"Instead of properly utilizing Ice-Fire Affinity, you choose to research some mimicry magic. Based on your explanation, the mimicry magic you use must surely be weaker in intensity than Ice-Fire Affinity. Why didn't you use Ice-Fire Affinity to attack me yesterday? In that case, your chances might have been greater.\"\n\nNianbing said, \"It's not that I didn't want to use it, but in yesterday's situation facing you, a top-tier fire-elemental magician, both ice and fire posed relatively much smaller threats to you. That's why I chose a combination of ice and wind, and fire and light, to offset more of your offensive power. However, I still miscalculated. Your magic intensity already far surpassed my magic usage; technique could no longer bridge the gap between us, so I lost. It's true, Ice-Fire Affinity is already excellent, it will benefit me for a lifetime. But you cannot deny that other elemental magics each have their own characteristics. For example, wind magic can carry me aloft, spatial magic can save my life at crucial moments, and light magic can dispel all evil auras. Do you really think they are useless? Furthermore, what I'm researching are just the techniques for using these different types of magic. During my meditation and cultivation process, what I truly practice is still Ice-Fire Affinity magic power; that is my foundation.\"\n\nPrince Rong's eyes flickered continuously. From Nianbing's explanation, he heard too many incredulous things. Having been immersed in magic for decades, it was not the first time he had encountered a magician like Nianbing. Nianbing was not only a genius in the magic world, but his luck was also astonishingly good. Aside from anything else, merely being able to grasp Ice-Fire Affinity through exploration and obtaining several other supreme quality gems already proved his luck. Prince Rong had always believed that strength and effort were directly proportional, but he also believed in luck. If a person had not even a shred of luck in their entire life, then they could not possibly achieve great things. One might ask, among the powerful individuals in the world, whose growth could be separated from luck? Ordinary people also have luck, but the difference between ordinary people and the powerful lies in their inability to seize the opportunities presented by their luck.\n\nNianbing watched Prince Rong as he pondered. \"I've said everything I needed to say. Now, it should be time for you to fulfill your promise and let me leave, right?\"\n\nPrince Rong looked up at Nianbing and said, \"You may. You can leave at any time. However, don't you want to retrieve your blades? Without them, your mimicry magic cannot be cast at all, and even your own strength will be greatly diminished. There's one thing you might not know: even though you are already an Arch-Magus, you have never fully unleashed the power of the Flame God Stone.\"\n\nNianbing snorted disdainfully, \"Don't think too highly of yourself. What you know, I might not necessarily not know. The power of these supreme quality gems is closely related to the user's ability. Only when my strength is great will the power they display be greater. Am I wrong, Prince Rong? I indeed want my treasures back, but are you willing to give them? Back then, for a single Flame God Stone, you even sent people to hunt my father and me for thousands of miles. Now, with six gems of the same caliber before you, are you truly willing to give them up?\"\n\nPrince Rong chuckled coldly, suppressing the anger Nianbing had provoked. \"You claim to understand, but in truth, you don't fully understand these six blades. They are no longer just six gems. The gems and the blades, in their union, have formed a soul-body relationship. Even if the gems were removed, a portion of their energy would be consumed by the blades, significantly diminishing the gems' inherent value. And these six magic blades are now not something just anyone can use. This is what's called a divine artifact recognizing its master. Once a divine artifact of this caliber confirms its master, its aura becomes completely linked to the master. Unless their master dies, no one else can absolutely use them. I presume these six blades have all drunk your blood, haven't they?\"\n\nHearing Prince Rong say this, Nianbing immediately remembered. \"That's right! Whether it was the Morning Dew Blade and True Sun Blade, which he saw being forged with his own eyes, or the four precious blades he obtained later, they had indeed all drunk his blood. Even the Arrogant Sky Blade of the Gentle Whisper of Freedom, before he left Ice City, Long Zhi had known to nourish the Wind Whisper Stone with blood. A treasured blade recognizing its master—his heart immediately warmed.\n___\n¹ This is a classical Chinese saying, implying that death can be weighty or insignificant depending on its cause or purpose.",

    "content": "Since Prince Rong had already spoken thus, then he must intend to return the treasured blades to him. As he thought of this, a fervent look unconsciously appeared in his eyes.\n\nPrince Rong thought to himself, \"Kid, old ginger is spicier.* You're still a bit green if you want to contend with me. I refuse to believe there's nothing that can attract you.\" He said impassively on the surface: \"It's not difficult to retrieve these treasured blades. You only need to do one thing for the Rong family, and I will return all of them to you. I can even lend them to you for use while you're doing this. Judging by your capability, completing this matter won't be difficult. Are you willing?\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment. Although he was eager to retrieve the treasured blades, his mind was not flustered. \"Doing one thing for you in exchange for the treasured blades is nothing, but this matter cannot be against morality and cannot go against my will. Please tell me the matter first, then I will decide whether or not to do it.\"\n\nPrince Rong smiled faintly and said: \"This matter is very simple. I want you to replace Rong Bingyun in a competition taking place in a little over a month. Use your mimicry magic. When you compete, you must do so in the Rong family's name.\"\n\nNian Bing was momentarily stunned, then flatly stated: \"No, absolutely not. I cannot agree to this.\"\n\nPrince Rong's brows slightly furrowed. \"Don't you want to get your treasured blades back? You should know that although I've already agreed to let you leave, treasures of that caliber are rare and hard to come by.\"\n\nNian Bing said: \"It's not that I don't want to get my treasured blades back, but that I cannot represent the Rong family in this competition, because I myself am a participant in this competition.\"\n\nPrince Rong was startled. \"What? You're a participant yourself? Which country do you represent?\"\n\nNian Bing looked up at him, then slowly said: \"I represent the Ice Moon Empire. Of course, it couldn't be the Ice God Tower. Rather, it's the Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild, which is at the bottom of the rankings in every session.\" As he spoke, he took out his number ten plate from his spatial ring and placed it in front of Prince Rong: \"My second master is Long Zhi, the Guild Master of the Ice Water Empire Magician's Guild and a Wind Arch-Mage. He showed me kindness, and I myself am an elder of the Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild.\"\n\nLooking at the number plate on the writing desk, Prince Rong suddenly smiled. Nian Bing's heart was filled with a strange feeling as he watched his smile. How much he had wished to see his grandfather's smile when he was little! But all his childhood memories combined didn't amount to as much as he'd seen today. Alas, in his heart, he was no longer his grandfather. Prince Rong said: \"I can't deny it, you're very clever. If I'm not mistaken, you intend to use the Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild to contend with the Ice God Tower, don't you? This time, you came to participate in the competition specifically to strike a blow to the Ice God Tower's arrogance, didn't you!? But, do you have the confidence to defeat the Ice God Tower's representative?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart greatly shook. As expected of the Huayong Empire's First Imperial Preceptor! He had discerned so much just from this small number plate. Although inwardly shaken, he showed no change in expression on the surface, saying indifferently: \"In life, some things cannot be lost. Even if the Ice God Tower's representative is strong, I don't believe she can reach the Arch-Mage realm before the age of twenty-five. You've already seen my mimicry magic; as long as the opponent is still a Mage, I have a chance to win through skill. If I truly cannot win, I wonder if you've heard of a forbidden spell that comes at the cost of cursing oneself?\"\n\n\"What?\" Nian Bing's previous words had not surprised Prince Rong, but his last sentence made Prince Rong stand up from his seat again. \"You've learned the Curse of Life? Where did you learn it?\" Prince Rong couldn't be more familiar with the magic of the Curse of Life. This was an absolute forbidden magic, used to fight with one's life on the line. Back then, he had a friend who learned this incantation from somewhere unknown, and in a crisis, that friend, relying on the Curse of Life, completely burned away his own life to save Prince Rong. Thus, he had a deep emotional connection to this curse.\n\nNian Bing said calmly: \"I'm sorry, Prince Rong, I cannot tell you that. You only need to know that I know this magic. I am determined to win this competition.\"\n\nSighing deeply, Prince Rong looked at Nian Bing with flickering eyes. This suddenly returned grandson brought him too much shock. \"Tian'er, you are gone, yet you've sent back such an outstanding grandson. Are you blaming me? Perhaps Nian Bing is right; I was indeed too stubbornly self-willed and arrogant back then. I only considered myself and my family, never your feelings.\" A person's character changes with age. Ten years ago, Prince Rong would probably have already locked Nian Bing up, but now it was different. He was old, over eighty years old, and had changed from preferring quietness to preferring liveliness, especially valuing familial affection many times more than before. Looking at the handsome, tall grandson before him who refused to acknowledge him, and thinking of his already deceased son, his heart softened.\n\nWith a flash of light, Prince Rong, using some spatial magic item, summoned six-colored light onto his writing desk. A hazy, treasure-like aura instantly filled the entire study. These were Nian Bing's six magic blades. Perhaps sensing Nian Bing's aura, the six divine blades trembled simultaneously, and the Arrogant Heaven Blade even emitted a faint hum. Suddenly seeing the six blades, Nian Bing could barely conceal the excitement in his heart, his gaze fixed on the blades' gleam, as if looking at his best friends.\n\n\"Take them. Whether you acknowledge it or not, you are my grandson. Whoever between you and Rong Bing wins the final championship will make the Ice God Tower lose face for me. However, if you don't want to get into trouble, find a way to change your appearance after leaving here.\" Prince Rong's gaze softened as he looked at Nian Bing, waiting for him to take his things.\n\nNian Bing looked somewhat dazed at Prince Rong. He had never thought he could retrieve these six blades so easily. Lights flickered continuously in his eyes. Finally, the allure of the treasured blades dispelled the doubts in his heart. One by one, he placed his six divine blades into his spatial ring. \"Prince Rong, I'm leaving.\"\n\nPrince Rong nodded. \"Go. You're wearing Rong Bing's clothes right now. With your similar appearances, no one will stop you. I imagine we'll meet again soon.\"\n\nTaking a deep breath, Nian Bing gazed deeply into Prince Rong's profound eyes. He found that the hatred in his heart had somewhat faded, and couldn't help but secretly think, \"Is this the feeling that blood is thicker than water? Even if I still hated him, even if he had done so many wrongs to me and my father before, he was still my grandfather after all.\" Nian Bing now somewhat understood why his father had never resisted Prince Rong back then. Without bowing, he turned and walked towards the door. As he pulled open the study door, his steps halted. \"If I avenge my parents, perhaps I will return to this home.\"\n\nNian Bing's figure disappeared. Prince Rong sat back down in his chair as if he had suddenly aged several years. His deep eyes became dazed, and his hands trembled slightly. \"Tian'er, Tian'er, are you truly dead? Don't worry, I will seek justice for you. You are my son after all! It seems my remaining twilight years will be spent in conflict.\" Seeing Nian Bing again and learning of his son's death, Prince Rong, Rong Yan, had made a decision. He looked up, gazing towards the distant north. \"Wait for me. We will have a chance to meet again.\"\n\nNot far after Nian Bing exited the room, he met Rong Bing, who was anxiously waiting. When Rong Bing saw Nian Bing was unharmed, he immediately sighed in relief. \"How was it? Did Grandfather make things difficult for you?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head. \"No. And he even returned all my blades to me. Brother, there's something I must tell you: I will also participate in the New Talent Magician Competition a little over a month from now.\"\n\nRong Bing said indifferently: \"That's good! Since Grandfather chose for you to participate, it proves your strength is above mine. Nian Bing, it seems you haven't wasted your years.\"\n\n\"No, Brother, you misunderstood. Although I will participate, I will not be representing the Huayong Empire. I will represent the Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild. Perhaps we will meet on the competition grounds.\"\n\nRong Bing's brows slightly furrowed. \"You represent the Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild? That's fine. Even meeting on the competition grounds is nothing to worry about.\"\n\nNian Bing grabbed Rong Bing's shoulder. \"Brother, promise me, if we meet on the competition grounds, please don't show any mercy, okay?\"\n\nA hint of a smile flashed in Rong Bing's eyes. \"Don't worry, I won't show mercy. However, I hope we don't meet too early; that way, we can clear more obstacles, can't we?\"\n\nNian Bing clearly hadn't expected Rong Bing to be so indifferent about the competition. \"Brother, if I ultimately win the championship, will you blame me?\"\n\nRong Bing laughed heartily. \"Do you think I'm that kind of person? The championship is earned through one's own ability. If you win the championship, it only means you have the strength. I'll only be happy for you.\"\n\n\"Then I'm leaving. Prince Rong didn't make things difficult for me. Remember the address I gave you; if anything happens, go find me there.\" The matters here were concluded, and there was no need to stay.\n\nRong Bing nodded, smiling faintly. \"Then I won't see you off. Just leave the way you came in. It seems I'll have to hide a bit longer before reappearing.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly: \"Indeed! We really do look alike. But, Brother! You seem to have quite a few romantic debts. On my very first day in Dutian City, two of your lady friends already mistook me for you. In the future, it'll be troublesome if my sisters-in-law mistake me for you!\"\n\nHearing Nian Bing's teasing, Rong Bing couldn't help but blush. \"Don't talk nonsense, I'm not even married yet, where do these 'sisters-in-law' come from? And I don't have that many lady friends! Who did you run into?\"\n\nNian Bing said: \"One was some 'Brother Mei's' sister, and the other was named Yinuo. Thanks to your kindness, Miss Yinuo even gave me a very useful magic item and paid for it for me. Brother, next time you see her, you really must thank her. Hehe.\"\n\nRong Bing wryly smiled: \"So you're talking about those two. Miss Mei and I have absolutely nothing going on; she just unilaterally keeps bothering me. Her brother always knows how to fan the flames for no reason.\"\n\nNian Bing's gaze shifted, and he smiled faintly: \"So in that case, there *is* something between you and Miss Yinuo?\"\n\nRong Bing sighed lightly. \"It's just a political marriage. Her full name is Hua Yinuo, and she's the current Emperor Huatian's most beloved granddaughter. We've been betrothed since childhood, and we're supposed to marry in two years. Luckily, I'm fortunate; Yinuo doesn't have the arrogance typical of the royal family. Still, you even fooled her; it seems we really are incredibly alike!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly: \"Now I can relax. Accepting a gift from my official sister-in-law is nothing. When you two marry, I'll definitely give you a grand gift.\"\n\n\"Alright, you brat, you just escaped from Grandfather's place and you're already grinning mischievously. Hurry up and go. It wouldn't be good if we ran into anyone together.\" Rong Bing said with a smile.\n\nNian Bing sighed lightly. \"Brother, do you know? It's been so long since I felt this relaxed. It feels so good to be with you. Before, I had to rely on myself for everything. Now that I've seen you, at least my heart has someone to lean on; I don't have to live with a mask on anymore. Brother, I'm leaving. Take care.\" He squeezed his brother's shoulder firmly, then turned and left.\n\nIt was already afternoon when he returned to the inn. Nian Bing's stomach was already rumbling. Earlier, due to mental tension, he hadn't noticed, but now that he was relaxed, an intense hunger constantly assailed him. His mental energy had only recovered by thirty percent, making him feel very tired. He was too lazy to go out to eat, so he just ordered some random food at the inn. Tasting these ordinary foods, he couldn't help but miss his own cooking. Lately, he had been busy cultivating magic, and he had indeed neglected his stomach quite a bit. After this competition ended, he definitely had to cook a grand meal to reward himself, and also let his brother taste his culinary skills.\n\nAfter eating, meditation occupied most of Nian Bing's time. When he awoke from meditation, his magical and mental energy had fully recovered. The feeling of fully recovered magic was truly good. Nian Bing didn't bother to continue meditating; instead, he took out the magic notes Rong Bing had given him from his spatial ring and began reading them. Although the two followed different cultivation paths, Rong Bing was, after all, a Mage. From his notes, Nian Bing saw many of Rong Bing's insights into fire magic. These detailed annotations were much better than magic books. Soon, Nian Bing became engrossed, immersing himself wholeheartedly in the knowledge of magic, just as he had done in the library.\n\nHowever, this situation did not last long, because there was a knock at the door.\n\n\"Nian Bing, are you there?\" Rong Bing's familiar voice came from outside the door, startling Nian Bing awake from his reading. He quickly jumped off the bed, walked a few steps to the door, and welcomed Rong Bing in.\n\n\"Brother, why are you here? The New Talent Magician Competition is about to begin; don't you need to cultivate more?\" Nian Bing looked at his brother with some surprise.\n\nRong Bing smiled faintly: \"The effect of last-minute preparation is limited after all. I have confidence in myself. Look what this is.\" As he spoke, he took out a book from his embrace and gave it to Nian Bing. To be precise, it wasn't a real book but a stack of papers bound with thread. Nian Bing took it and saw several large characters written on the first page: \"Compendium of Ancient and Remnant Magic Arrays with Annotations.\" Flipping further, he saw that the handwriting on the pages was still fresh; it was clearly a copied book!\n\nNian Bing looked up and saw the bloodshot eyes in Rong Bing's eyes. Without needing to ask, he knew what his brother had done. Nian Bing's eyes welled up. \"Brother, you...\"\n\nRong Bing smiled faintly: \"Quick, see if you can use it. You're definitely stronger than me when it comes to magic arrays; I get dizzy just looking at those complicated symbols. You really need to work harder! I think this book should keep you busy for a while. I copied it from over a dozen magic array books; they're all extremely complex ancient magic arrays. The annotations on them were left by some of our ancestors, and they're very detailed. They should be quite useful to you.\"\n\nNian Bing tightly clutched the papers in his hand. This was the fruit of Rong Bing's all-nighter! Twelve years had passed, but his brother hadn't changed one bit; he was still as good to him as before.\n\n\"Alright, we're brothers; don't blame me if I get upset if you start talking about gratitude. You've finally returned; come on, I'll take you out to savor the delicacies of our Dutian City. Magic research isn't urgent right now; being too tired is counterproductive.\" With that, he pulled Nian Bing and started walking out.\n\nIndeed! Brothers don't need to say thanks; some things are much stronger done than said. Nian Bing carefully put the stack of papers and the notes into his spatial ring, then followed Rong Bing out of the inn. Before leaving the inn, Nian Bing used the newly acquired brooch to change his appearance and hair; his hair turned black. Under its effect, his face underwent some subtle changes. Each facial feature was only slightly altered, but combined, they made him look completely different from before. He was still a handsome young man, but now no one would feel he resembled Rong Bing.\n\n\"Brother, you worked hard all night, you don't need to treat me. Go back and rest quickly. Maintaining good mental energy is a must for magicians.\" Nian Bing looked at the hint of fatigue in Rong Bing's eyes, and a pang of pity rose in his heart. This was all because of him!\n\nRong Bing smiled faintly. \"Alright, even if you don't eat, I still have to! You know I worked hard all night; how can I not properly reward myself? It's almost noon anyway. I'll go back to meditate after we eat.\" Since he had said so, Nian Bing couldn't refuse Rong Bing's kindness again. The two strode forward, heading towards Dutian City's most prosperous city center.\n\nAs they walked, Rong Bing explained the surrounding buildings to Nian Bing like a tour guide, speaking gleefully. Aside from the occasional hint of fatigue in his eyes, it was hard to tell from his appearance that he hadn't slept all night.\n\n\"Look, that's our destination for today,\" Rong Bing said, pointing to a shop not far ahead. \"This restaurant is quite famous. Although the shop isn't big, the food they make is absolutely first-class, and the prices are cheap. My mouth has always been very picky, but I'm a regular customer here. Even Grandfather often has his servants buy food from here to eat at home.\"\n\nNian Bing looked ahead and saw a two-story shop not far away, bustling with activity. There was even a long queue outside. Above the shop, the plaque displayed two large gilded characters: \"Utmost Freshness.\" Seeing this, he couldn't help but smile faintly. \"This shop has quite a boast! What do they specialize in? Seafood?\"\n\nRong Bing shook his head. \"Of course not. Seafood is everywhere, but what they have here is unique. Come on, your old brother wouldn't lie to you. You'll know once you taste it.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Rong Bing pulled Nian Bing past the long queue to the shop's entrance. The waiter responsible for maintaining order at the door immediately greeted him when he saw him. \"Little Prince, you've arrived! The usual spot?\"\n\nFacing outsiders, Rong Bing no longer had the gentle smile he showed Nian Bing. A layer of coldness covered his face; he was too lazy to even speak, merely nodding.\n\nThe waiter seemed accustomed to him acting like this and quickly led the two into the Utmost Freshness Restaurant.\n\nSomeone in the long queue outside the shop said in surprise: \"Didn't they say there was no room inside? How did they just go in?\" Another person said dismissively: \"Kid, you must be new here. You don't even recognize the Little Prince of Prince Rong's Estate. The Prince Rong family serves the country and its people; if they still had to queue to eat, we wouldn't agree to it. A little late meal won't starve you to death.\" Although the latter person spoke extremely impolitely, the one who spoke first didn't dare to utter a peep and quickly lowered his head, continuing to queue obediently.\n\nNian Bing and Rong Bing walked into the Utmost Freshness Restaurant. The moment they entered, a rich, fresh aroma with a herbal fragrance came rushing at them. Nian Bing's nose twitched twice, and a surprised glint couldn't help but appear in his eyes. From this mixed fresh aroma, he actually couldn't distinguish what the raw ingredients were. The reason was simple: there were too many ingredients in this blended aromatic dish to determine in a short while.\n\nThis restaurant was very distinctive; each table was separated by bamboo screens. One could only vaguely see people inside, but not clearly. The waiter led Nian Bing and Rong Bing to a table on the first floor, in the innermost spot by the window. As they passed other tables, one could see through the bamboo screens that all of them were already occupied; only this one was empty.\n\nThis was a good spot; by simply lifting the bamboo screen, one could clearly see everything on the street. Although the shop was very crowded, it wasn't noisy. Rong Bing smiled faintly: \"Just the two of us, let's sit here. Although it's not a private room, I like the airy atmosphere here. The private rooms on the second floor can seat a dozen or so people; there's no need for us to use one.\"\n\nListening to Rong Bing's simple words, Nian Bing couldn't help but gain a deeper understanding of his brother. With his status as a Little Prince, it wouldn't be unusual for him to have a private room reserved permanently, yet he only kept a small, unassuming table. This simple style deeply resonated with Nian Bing.\n\nRong Bing looked up at the waiter and said: \"The usual, but today add eight more portions of ingredients. You choose them. Make sure they're the best.\"\n\nThe waiter acknowledged and turned to leave. In a moment, a large clay pot was brought over. On the front of the clay pot was an iron box, the contents of which were unknown. The waiter skillfully opened one side of the iron box, took out a tinderbox from his embrace, and lit it inside. Immediately, with a puff, flames emerged from the top of the box, heating the bottom of the clay pot.\n\nNian Bing looked at the small iron box in surprise, not understanding how it worked. Rong Bing saw the doubt in his heart and smiled faintly: \"This is a method invented by this shop. The method is actually very simple, but the cost is very high. So, don't be fooled by the small storefront; the food here is actually a bit more expensive than in the large restaurants outside. Do you know what's in this iron box? It's high-proof liquor. Undiluted liquor, ignited by fire, naturally becomes the best heating source. Its biggest characteristic is that it produces no smoke.\"\n\nLiquor—hearing this word, Nian Bing's heart couldn't help but thump. As a top chef, this sudden realization made him think of many things. It wasn't just for heating; he could also envision many cooking methods. A rich alcoholic fragrance, when properly applied in dishes, would definitely produce excellent results.\n\nWhile Nian Bing was pondering his culinary skills, the waiter opened the lid of the clay pot and turned to leave. A rich aroma came thick and strong, drawing Nian Bing to look into the pot. To his surprise, it was a pot of white porridge, bubbling with dense air bubbles under the heat of the flame. The aroma emanated from the porridge itself. Nian Bing sniffed and couldn't help but exclaim: \"What fine porridge! Although it appears to be plain white porridge, it contains thick broth made from stewed old hen, plus some specially selected medicinal herbs ground into powder. Let me see... there should be goji berries, Sanqi, and perhaps one or two more that I can't quite identify by smell.\"\n\nThis time, it was Rong Bing's turn to be surprised. \"Little brother, have you eaten here before? How do you know more than I do? I've eaten here so many times, and I still don't know what's in this white porridge.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Brother, your younger brother isn't just a magician; he's also a chef! I'll have to let you taste my culinary skills sometime.\"\n\nAs they spoke, the waiter returned with a large tray holding eight plates of ingredients: four kinds of greens and four kinds of meat. The greens were crown daisy, rapeseed greens, lettuce, and water spinach, while the four kinds of meat were beef, lamb, chicken, and pork. Both the greens and the meats were raw, unprocessed. Seeing this, Nian Bing couldn't help but say in surprise: \"Are we supposed to cook them by swirling them in the porridge?\"\n\nRong Bing picked up the plate of crown daisy and put it into the porridge, smiling faintly: \"Exactly, you cook them by swirling them in the porridge. What they serve here is the Hundred Flavor Porridge Pot. The white porridge itself has a wonderful flavor, and each time an ingredient is added, the flavor undergoes a transformation. It's absolutely delicious! Moreover, its nutritional value is very high.\" As he spoke, he stirred the pot with a ladle, ensuring the crown daisy fully blended with the white porridge.\n\nThis novel way of eating was the first Nian Bing had seen, and he became greatly interested. Crown daisy cooks easily, shrinking when heated. Rong Bing served him a bowl and placed it in front of him, then served himself a bowl, before adding a plate of pork. \"Quick, try it. Didn't you say you were a chef? Appraise the taste of this porridge pot.\" The fresh white porridge with greens, indeed, the change in flavor greatly surprised Nian Bing. It was the first time in days he had eaten something so delicious. In a moment, a bowl of delicious porridge was already down. Rong Bing continuously added plate after plate of ingredients into the pot. Just as he said, each time an ingredient was added, the porridge pot's flavor would change. When the white porridge in the pot decreased to a certain level, the waiter would come and add more prepared white porridge. After the first eight plates of ingredients were eaten, another eight plates of various seafood, such as shrimp, squid, crab meat, and the like, arrived. The flavors transformed even more frequently. Nian Bing and Rong Bing, both young men full of vigor, had their appetites greatly opened. They ate a full three pots of white porridge and sixteen plates of ingredients before finally stopping, satisfied.\n\n\"Brother, this is truly a great place. Experiencing this cooking method has been a great inspiration to me. It truly lives up to its name, 'Hundred Flavor Porridge Pot'!\" Nian Bing exclaimed, looking at the empty pot in front of him. By then, the liquor in the iron box below had already burned out. The waiter brought over a plate of fruit for them to cleanse their palates. After eating two pieces of fruit, Nian Bing said: \"Brother, I urgently need to use the restroom. Wait for me for a moment.\"\n\nRong Bing chuckled. \"You eat and then you need to go right away; you really are straightforward! Go quickly. Turn right after you go out, walk to the end, then turn left, and you'll see the place of the five drum cycle.**\" Having said that, he even winked at Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing got up and left. A knowing smile appeared in Rong Bing's eyes as he leisurely ate fruit. Just then, he suddenly heard some commotion outside. He couldn't help but lift the bamboo screen and look out. He saw the waiter responsible for maintaining order outside politely declining a young girl. Upon seeing this girl, even the haughty Rong Bing couldn't help but feel a bit dazed. This girl was too beautiful. Although her aqua-blue long dress wasn't perfectly neat, it couldn't hide her peerless beauty. Her pinkish-red long hair cascaded down her back, looking a bit messy. Her dusty and travel-worn appearance made one's heart ache to see. A layer of frost covered her exquisite face as she said with a slight pout: \"I haven't been here in a long time, and you've added so many rules. I'm not eating here anyway, can't I even take it to go? I've traveled a long way and I'm very hungry.\"\n\nThe waiter was equally captivated by the girl's beauty, but alas, the Utmost Freshness Restaurant had strict rules, so he could only helplessly say: \"I'm sorry, miss, we have rules here; there is no takeout service. As you can see, there's such a long queue outside. If you wish to dine here, please join the back of the line. Rules cannot be broken!\" The moment the waiter said this, before the girl could speak, someone in the queue immediately said: \"Miss, come here! It's almost my turn. If you don't mind, how about dining at our table?\" As soon as this was said, it immediately drew a chorus of agreement.\n\nA cold glint flashed in the stunningly beautiful girl's eyes. \"No need, thank you for your kindness. I refuse to believe there isn't a single place to eat in this enormous Dutian City.\"\n___\n*   *Old ginger is spicier:* A Chinese idiom meaning that older, more experienced people are wiser or more astute.\n**   *The place of the five drum cycle:* A humorous and somewhat poetic Chinese euphemism for a toilet, playing on the word \"cycle\" (輪迴) which can refer to the Buddhist concept of reincarnation, and \"five drums\" (五鼓) which refers to the five watches of the night, implying a natural \"cycle\" or rhythm.",

    "title": "Chapter 101: The Bing Girl·Nian Bing’s Open Heart (Part 1) (Part 2)",
    "content": "Seeing the girl's somewhat disappointed expression, a rare trace of pity unexpectedly arose in Rong Bing's heart. Speaking clearly from across the window, he said, \"Miss, we have finished our meal. If you don't mind, please come in.\"\n\nThe girl looked up towards Rong Bing. When she saw his handsome face, her whole body trembled violently. Her beautiful eyes instantly reddened, and her lips buzzed as if she wanted to say something but couldn't. Seeing her expression, Rong Bing was also startled. He clearly didn't know her! Why was she looking at him like that? A shiver ran down his spine, and he quickly gestured to the waiter outside to lower the bamboo screen.\n\nWhen the young prince of Prince Rong's Manor spoke, how could the waiter dare to be slow? He quickly led the girl into Jixian Hotel. In a moment, they arrived at Rong Bing and Nian Bing's table. As the bamboo screen was lifted, Rong Bing only felt a blur before his eyes. The girl was already a foot away from him. Before he could understand, she had already thrown herself into his arms. Rong Bing was greatly alarmed. Although he felt good about this extremely beautiful girl, he was always disciplined. Instinctively, he turned and stood up from his chair. The girl's lunge was very strong, and missing her target, she immediately lost her balance. Rong Bing saw her prop herself up on the chair with one hand, and she surprisingly stood on her hands. Before he could react, the girl was already standing upright again, her beautiful eyes now showing a layer of anger.\n\n\"Nian Bing, you...\" The girl's delicate body trembled slightly. She was none other than Feng Nü, who had been desperately searching for Nian Bing. Having rushed all the way, she had barely rested. Upon arriving in Dutian City, her body finally couldn't take it anymore. She happened to see that this restaurant was doing good business, thinking Ye Wudao's judgment must be good. So, she was about to eat a meal when the scene outside occurred. Suddenly seeing \"Nian Bing\" poke his head out from the window instantly filled Feng Nü with mixed feelings of grief and joy. Nian Bing was really not dead, he really wasn't dead! She impatiently entered the hotel, but never expected her attempt to embrace him to be rejected by \"Nian Bing\".\n\nHearing Feng Nü call out \"Nian Bing\", Rong Bing finally reacted, realizing she must have misunderstood. Just as he was about to explain, the bamboo screen was lifted, and Nian Bing walked in from outside. The moment he entered, he spotted Feng Nü, and his eyes immediately shone with surprise. He quickly stepped forward, opening his arms to embrace Feng Nü. Feng Nü was furious at the moment. Seeing a strange man coming to embrace her, she didn't think twice, raising her hand and striking with a palm. In his surprise, Nian Bing had forgotten that he had changed his appearance. With his abilities, how could he possibly dodge Feng Nü's attack without using magic?\n\n*Bang*. Nian Bing was sent flying by Feng Nü's palm, crashing through a bamboo screen and heavily landing on the table next door. The table couldn't withstand the impact and instantly shattered. Luckily, the guests at that table had just paid and left, so they weren't affected. Although furious, Feng Nü still retained her rationality. While her strike wasn't light, she had held back. Nian Bing spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. He was stunned by Feng Nü's palm, but thanks to his body, which had been modified by Jalamandis, he wasn't severely injured. He struggled to get up from the wooden splinters.\n\nSeeing his brother injured, Rong Bing's eyes gleamed coldly. With a whoosh, flames surged around his body, and he stepped forward, blocking his brother.\n\nFeng Nü looked at the anger and unfamiliarity in Rong Bing's eyes. \"You, Nian Bing, don't you recognize me anymore?\"\n\n\"Don't misunderstand.\" Nian Bing stepped out from beside Rong Bing, placed a hand on his chest, and said, \"Feng Nü, I am Nian Bing. He is my brother.\"\n\nFeng Nü froze, looking at Nian Bing in confusion. The flames around Rong Bing disappeared, and with a half-smile, he looked at Nian Bing and said, \"Alright! It's my turn to impersonate you this time.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at the hurried waiters approaching and whispered, \"This isn't the place to talk. Let's go back to the inn first.\"\n\nBy now, Feng Nü had sobered up considerably. She had recognized Nian Bing's voice and also noticed some subtle differences between Rong Bing and Nian Bing, but her confusion grew even stronger.\n\nRong Bing told the approaching waiters, \"Everything's fine here. Put any damages on my tab. Let's go.\"\n\nThe three of them left Jixian Hotel together and returned to the inn at the fastest possible speed. As soon as he entered his room, Nian Bing immediately reached into his clothes, pressed the brooch on the front of his inner garment, and reverted to his original appearance.\n\nSeeing two identical Nian Bings in front of her, Feng Nü was utterly stunned. \"You, you all...\"\n\nRong Bing smiled slightly, \"This young lady must have misunderstood. Nian Bing and I are brothers; our fathers were twins, so we've looked very much alike since childhood. No wonder you mistook us. However, next time you must be more careful. Don't embrace the wrong sweetheart. Nian Bing, I'm tired. I'll go back and rest first. You and this young lady have a good talk.\" After saying this, he gave Nian Bing an odd smile and left the inn.\n\nRong Bing left. Feng Nü looked at Nian Bing and said, \"What's going on? You two...\"\n\nNian Bing sighed, stepped forward, took Feng Nü's hand, and led her to sit on the edge of the bed. He said, \"Feng Nü, listen to me explain. That was my brother just now. Just as he said, we look very much alike, and he holds a very high position in Dutian City. To avoid unnecessary trouble, I bought a magic item that can change my appearance. It's quite a coincidence; just a few days ago, my brother's fiancée mistook me, and now, you've mistaken him.\"\n\nFeng Nü's pretty face flushed. She gave Nian Bing a sidelong glance and said, \"Does your chest still hurt? Back then, I...\"\n\nNian Bing gripped Feng Nü's hand tightly and said, \"It's fine, I'm quite tough.* Seeing you, all my injuries are healed. Feng Nü, did you come specifically to find me? Do your clan elders know?\"\n*Lit. \"my skin is very thick,\" meaning \"I am tough/resilient.\"\n\nFeng Nü's eyes reddened. Remembering the worries of the past few days, she couldn't help but throw herself into Nian Bing's embrace, hugging him tightly. Burying her pretty face in his chest, she burst into tears.\n\nNian Bing was bewildered by Feng Nü's crying. For a moment, he didn't know what to say. He embraced her delicate body, feeling her soft form, and his heart was filled with tender affection.\n\nNian Bing's warm embrace made Feng Nü feel very safe. The grievances in her heart completely dissipated with her crying. Gradually, their hearts grew closer. As her crying subsided, Feng Nü slowly raised her head. Nian Bing was also looking down at her. Both their bodies trembled simultaneously. Nian Bing could no longer suppress the feelings in his heart. He lowered his head and deeply, deeply kissed those vibrant, tender red lips.\n\nFeng Nü first struggled slightly, but she quickly softened in Nian Bing's passion. Her hands, wrapped around his waist, hooked onto his neck. Without the need for verbal exchange, their emotions had sublimated in this deep kiss, and both their hearts were filled with love for each other.\n\nAfter a long while, their lips parted. Feng Nü shyly lowered her head. She realized that, at some point, she was already sitting on Nian Bing's lap. Something hard seemed to be pressing against her beneath her hips. Her pretty face flushed as red as an apple, and Feng Nü's heart trembled violently. She wanted to get up but couldn't exert an ounce of strength throughout her body.\n\nNian Bing held Feng Nü, who was in close contact with him. His rationality struggled against his desires. Feng Nü's allure was too strong for him. To divert his attention, he stammered, \"Feng Nü, you still haven't told me how you left your clan's elders. Did they come here too?\"\n\nFeng Nü shook her head and whispered, \"Please let me go first, let me get up, or how can I talk?\"\n\nNian Bing suppressed his reluctance, picked up Feng Nü, and placed her beside him. Without physical contact, his impulsive emotions indeed subsided considerably.\n\nFeng Nü shyly glanced at Nian Bing and said, \"I purposely ran out to find you, or rather, I sneaked out. That day, Elder Kong said you died. At that time, I wanted to go look for your body, but Elder Xu knocked me out and took me back to the clan, locking me in the clan's Seal Chamber. Do you know how heartbroken I was? Later, for some reason, I actually broke open the seal. At that time, I didn't know whether I should be happy or sad. I immediately rushed to Oran City to search for your body. I thought, no matter what, I had to ensure you were laid to rest, and then I would perform mourning rituals for you.* Who knew, no matter how I searched, there was no trace of your body. Holding onto a glimmer of hope, I entered Oran City, thinking that since you had appeared at the Duke's Manor, perhaps there would be news of you there.\"\n*Lit. \"observe filial piety,\" referring to the act of performing mourning rituals and showing reverence, especially for deceased parents or elders.\n\nHearing this, Nian Bing couldn't help but interject, \"Then did you see my godmother? Feng Yan from your clan?\"\n\nFeng Nü shook her head and said, \"No. I had just arrived at the entrance of the Duke's Manor when I met Purple Clarity Sword. He told me you had come to Dutian City. I calculated the time and realized that you hadn't died after all. Nian Bing, do you know how happy I was then? I immediately rushed towards Dutian City, so I naturally didn't enter the Duke's Manor. I've also heard about Senior Feng Yan's matter. Actually, there's no telling who was right or wrong. She chose her true love, which was why she was not tolerated by the clan. Since the elders aren't around, why would I make things difficult for her? You don't have to worry.\"\n\nNian Bing knew Feng Nü had misunderstood his meaning and didn't explain. He couldn't help but take Feng Nü's fair, slender, jade-like hand again and whispered, \"What about you? Are you willing to give up everything in your clan to be with me? Feng Nü, I've had something I wanted to tell you since we last met.\"\n\nFeng Nü's whole body trembled. She suddenly reached out and urgently covered Nian Bing's mouth, saying, \"No, don't say it. Nian Bing, I'm sorry, I, I can't.\"\n\nNian Bing froze for a moment and said, \"Why? Feng Nü, could it be that you...\"\n\n\"No, it's not like that, Nian Bing. If you weren't in my heart, how could I have... But the Phoenix Clan cannot do without me! Perhaps, in the eyes of outsiders, our Phoenix Clan is a very powerful existence, but how would they know the Phoenix Clan's difficulties? The Phoenix Clan is led by elders, with five elders commanding the entire clan. The arrangement of the five elders wasn't always there; it's because of the Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony. Originally, after Senior Feng Yan's father, the Great Elder, passed away, Senior Feng Yan became the Phoenix of Hope for the clan. At that time, there was still plenty of time. As long as she could reach the third transformation of the Nine Phoenix Transformations, the Phoenix Illusory Demon Body, before the ceremony, it would be enough to cope with the changes during the ceremony. However, she left the Phoenix Clan because of her feelings. The Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony is not only an opportunity for our Phoenix Clan but also a test for it. If the ceremony cannot be completed, our entire Phoenix Clan will suffer a devastating blow. The ceremony is about to begin in less than two years. Nian Bing, if you truly have me in your heart, will you wait for me for two years? Two years from now, as long as I can help the Phoenix Clan get through the Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony, I will definitely let go of everything and be with you.\"\n\nLight flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. He pulled Feng Nü's hand away from his mouth and said, \"Feng Nü, being with me doesn't affect your relationship with the Phoenix Clan. I won't demand too much from you. As long as you wish, you can return to the Phoenix Clan anytime. You can still participate in the Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony two years from now! This doesn't affect our feelings for each other! Feng Nü, even though you don't want me to say it, I still want to tell you: I feel... about you, perhaps it was love at first sight. Since the first time I saw you, your presence* has been deeply imprinted in my heart. At that time, you were mysterious to me. Later, as I learned everything about you, your figure became clearer and clearer in my heart. However, I didn't dare face my feelings because I wanted revenge, and I was afraid of implicating you. At the same time, I didn't dare to give you a commitment of love, just like you are now. But now I understand what my master once said: when feelings arrive, nothing can stop them. No matter what happens in the future, Feng Nü, I must tell you: I—love—you—.\" He spoke the last three words clearly, one by one, his voice filled with sincerity.\n*The original Chinese character here (蚊子 - wénzi) literally means \"mosquito.\" This is almost certainly a typo in the original text for a character meaning \"image,\" \"figure,\" or \"presence\" (e.g., 影子 - yǐngzi or 樣子 - yàngzi), given the context that follows about \"your figure becoming clearer.\"\n\nFeng Nü's delicate body trembled, and tears streamed down her face. \"Nian Bing, I, I love you too.\" These words came out somewhat haltingly from her mouth, but when the last word was spoken, Feng Nü seemed to be freed. She returned to Nian Bing's embrace, and an aura of happiness revolved around their bodies. Both felt their hearts wonderfully full.\n\n\"Nian Bing, two years, will you wait for me for two years?\" Feng Nü whispered in Nian Bing's arms.\n\nNian Bing smiled and shook his head, saying, \"I don't want to, but I can promise you that I absolutely won't affect your participation in the Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony. At that time, I can even accompany you.\"\n\nFeng Nü's pretty face suddenly flushed crimson. She lowered her head and said, \"But, Nian Bing, you don't know, at the Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony, if the newly appointed Phoenix of Hope hasn't participated in the previous Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony, then this new Phoenix of Hope must be a virgin.\" When she spoke the last few words, her voice was almost a whisper. Luckily, Nian Bing's hearing was good, allowing him to hear clearly.\n\nNian Bing smiled, cupped Feng Nü's delicate face, and gently kissed her lips. \"Silly girl, what do you take me for? I will restrain myself until I formally marry you. Now you have no reason to refuse to be with me, right? Being together doesn't necessarily mean that kind of thing has to happen! Between us, it's a communication of hearts. Just having you by my side is enough.\"\n\nFeng Nü wrapped her arms around Nian Bing's neck and willingly offered a fragrant kiss. \"Nian Bing, I didn't expect you to understand me so much.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"However, if you keep seducing me like this, I'm afraid I won't be able to resist, so you'd better be careful.\"\n\nFeng Nü was startled and quickly jumped out of Nian Bing's embrace. Seeing his smiling face, she realized he was deliberately scaring her. Annoyed, she said, \"You're really awful. You just agreed to be with me, and now you're deliberately teasing me.\"\n\nNian Bing stood up, his eyes full of tenderness. \"You've traveled such a long distance. Go lie down and sleep for a bit. Look, you've gotten thin these past few days. Oh, right, you haven't eaten yet, have you? I'll go buy something for you to eat.\"\n\nFeng Nü pouted, \"No, I don't want to eat other food. I want to eat what you make. Nian Bing, do you know when I started to like you? It was that focused expression you had when you made me pigeon rice, combined with the delicious pigeon rice, that made such a deep impression on me.\"\n\nHearing her say that, Nian Bing couldn't help but smile wryly, \"I've heard people say that to win a man's heart, you must first conquer his stomach. I never expected that saying would be reversed for us.\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled, \"What, you don't want to cook for me?\"\n\nNian Bing gazed deeply at her, \"I'm willing to cook for you forever. Until the day I'm too old to move.\"\n\nFeng Nü's delicate body trembled slightly. \"Nian Bing, do you think our love can last? I'm afraid the elders won't accept you.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, yet his eyes were filled with arrogance. \"Feng Nü, the tragedy that happened to my parents will definitely not be replayed on us. I don't need their approval. When I have absolute strength, as long as you love me, no one's opinion will become an obstacle between us.\"\n\nListening to Nian Bing's firm voice and seeing the cold gleam flash in his eyes, for some reason, Feng Nü felt a sense of unease. She vaguely guessed that the shadow from Nian Bing's childhood always affected his heart. The coldness deep within him wasn't so easy to melt. His parents' deaths remained like a mountain pressing down on his heart. Feng Nü didn't try to persuade Nian Bing. She knew that whatever she said wouldn't be as effective as gradually warming his heart with her gentleness. She smiled slightly and softly said, \"Go quickly and get me something to eat. I'm hungry.\"\n\n\"As you command, my esteemed wife.\" After saying this, Nian Bing didn't wait for Feng Nü's playful rebuke and quickly darted out. In his joyful mood, he believed he could certainly make the best food.\n\nIt wasn't long before Nian Bing returned, carrying a plate with a large bowl on it, while Feng Nü was drowsily lying in bed. Seeing her tired appearance, his heart ached. \"Come, eat first, then sleep,\" he said, lifting the lid off the bowl. Instantly, a rich aroma filled the room.\n\nFeng Nü sat up and rubbed her eyes. \"Nian Bing, what is this?! It smells so good.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"You've traveled such a long distance, so you naturally need to replenish your energy. I know you can eat a lot, so I deliberately made a bit more. This is called Chicken and Glutinous Rice, and it's very effective for Spleen and Stomach Qi deficiency, loss of appetite, and fatigue and weakness.* Eat this, then have a good sleep, and your energy will be restored tomorrow.\"\n*These are terms from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) describing a condition where the spleen and stomach are weak, leading to symptoms like poor appetite, general fatigue, and lack of strength.\n\nFeng Nü had an absolute craving for Nian Bing's cooking. She took the tray from his hands. Smelling the tempting aroma, her appetite was instantly greatly boosted. Without caring about the heat, she sat there and began to eat heartily.\n\nWatching Feng Nü eat heartily without any lady-like grace, Nian Bing couldn't help but chuckle. \"Hey, Miss Feng Nü, you're a young lady, after all. Why are you eating like a little pig now?\"\n\nFeng Nü mumbled while eating, \"You're the pig. This rice tastes very good, though not as fresh as the pigeon rice, it has a bit more sweetness.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Could something made by this master chef himself be bad? Anyone can make this Chicken and Glutinous Rice, but the key is controlling the heat and the amount of ingredients. Besides chicken and glutinous rice, there are also red dates and coconut meat inside. I originally thought there wouldn't be coconut meat here, but unexpectedly, the inn actually had some. Dutian City is indeed unusually prosperous! To make this dish, simply put: chop the coconut meat, pit the red dates, shred the chicken, wash the glutinous rice thoroughly, put them all in a pot with an appropriate amount of water, and steam until cooked into rice.\"\n\nFeng Nü swallowed a mouthful of the delicious food and said in surprise, \"Is it really that simple? Couldn't I make it too?\"\n\nNian Bing laughed, \"You can try making it once. With me guiding you, the taste won't be too far off.\"\n\nFeng Nü looked at Nian Bing warily and said, \"I'm not doing it! Don't think you can trick me into cooking. If you teach me everything, won't cooking become my responsibility from now on?\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"My conspiracy has been exposed! Feng Nü, you're quite clever at times like this! Don't worry, after I get my revenge, we'll find a peaceful place to settle down. I'll make delicious food for you every day, changing it up, and really raise you into a little pig, the chubby kind.\" As soon as he mentioned a pig, Nian Bing couldn't help but think of Mao Mao's pet named Guanguan.\n\nFeng Nü gave Nian Bing a sidelong glance and said, \"I'm certainly not going to be a pig. With my combat aura, I just need to expend a bit more, and I won't get fat no matter how much I eat. Oh, right, I remember last time in the Fire Dragon Cave, that girl named Long Ling seemed to have feelings for you...\"\n\nHearing Feng Nü mention Long Ling, Nian Bing couldn't help but sigh softly. \"Feng Nü, Ling'er has deep feelings for me, and I also received kindness from her father. I have her in my heart, you...\"\n\nFeng Nü lowered her head and ate. After a long pause, she finally said, \"Everyone hopes to monopolize their lover's affections, and I'm no exception. But that girl loves you very deeply, I can see that, and she's also a good girl. I'm not a jealous woman,* but this will be the only exception.\"\n*Lit. \"vinegar jar woman,\" an idiom for a jealous woman.\n\nUnderstanding the meaning in Feng Nü's words, Nian Bing, who had been nervous, was instantly overjoyed. He took a few steps and sat beside Feng Nü, giving her pink cheek a kiss. He said, \"Feng Nü, I knew you were the best. Ling'er is a famous gentle lady. You two will definitely get along well when you're together.\"\n\nFeng Nü snorted, \"You lecherous little devil, you got off easy. I really don't know what's so good about you that you can charm girls into liking you.\"\n\nNian Bing laughed, \"Don't you like me too? Perhaps it's precisely because I can cook. I'm increasingly feeling that being a chef is much happier than being a magician. Maybe some girls don't like handsome men, but I doubt there are many girls who don't like to eat, right?! My cooking skills aren't something everyone can enjoy.\"\n\nIn a short while, a large bowl of rice had been completely eaten by Feng Nü. She contentedly put down her chopsticks and bowl. \"Oh, I'm so full. This is the first time I've eaten my fill in so many days. I want to sleep now. Could you go get another room? Please?\"\n\nSeeing Feng Nü's somewhat pleading expression, Nian Bing couldn't help but smile. Officially establishing his relationship with Feng Nü had greatly relaxed his heart. He couldn't help but smile faintly, \"Why open another room? Are we still afraid of gossip? Let others say whatever they want. I'm going to stay with you.\"\n\nFeng Nü was embarrassed. \"How can that be? Didn't you just promise me...\" It wasn't that she was afraid of gossip; she was afraid they wouldn't be able to control themselves. After all, the Phoenix Clan held a very important position in Feng Nü's heart.\n\nNian Bing couldn't help but burst out laughing at Feng Nü's shy expression. \"It seems you still have your guard up against me. Don't worry, I never sleep. You sleep in the bed, and I'll meditate beside you.\"\n\nOnly then did Feng Nü relax. She was truly exhausted and didn't care about Nian Bing teasing her. She pulled the quilt over her delicate body, and within a short while, even breaths could be heard.\n\nWatching Feng Nü fall asleep, Nian Bing was lost in thought. No matter when, Feng Nü was always so beautiful, breathtakingly beautiful. He hadn't forgotten Yu Ruyan's instruction. The reason he hadn't first verified Feng Nü's identity was out of pity for her current exhaustion. He planned to deal with it after she felt better. Leaning closer, he gently kissed Feng Nü's forehead. Then Nian Bing sat on the floor beside the bed and began his daily necessary meditation. Feng Nü's arrival made him extremely excited, and it took him a little less than an hour to enter a state of quiet cultivation.\n\nThree days passed quickly. Over these three days, Feng Nü's body had fully recovered. Nian Bing took her strolling around Dutian City every day, and the remaining time was spent studying the magic books Rong Bing gave him and meditating. Since Feng Nü's arrival, Nian Bing no longer ate outside; he was entirely responsible for their meals. To avoid surprising the inn's cooks, Nian Bing always cooked in their room. Anyway, he had magic, and his cooking utensils were also modern, so he wasn't afraid of being discovered. Feng Nü had become gentler than before, caring for and nurturing Nian Bing in every way. Being with her always brought Nian Bing great comfort. Yet, he fulfilled his promise; apart from holding hands, occasional hugs, and kisses, he did not overstep with Feng Nü. They maintained their relationship as lovers, filled with a sense of happiness for each other.\n\nToday, in the morning, the two of them toured the bustling urban area of Dutian City. After lunch, Nian Bing decided to complete the mission Yu Ruyan had given him. Although he knew that doing so might temporarily make Feng Nü leave him, he couldn't bear to postpone it any longer when he thought of Yu Ruyan's expression when she mentioned her eldest daughter.\n\n\"Feng Nü, I have something I want to tell you.\" Nian Bing held Feng Nü's hand and sat beside her.\n\nFeng Nü smiled faintly, \"Just say whatever it is. Why be so mysterious?\"\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath and said, \"When I tell you this, you must stay calm, okay? No matter what I say, don't get overly emotional; that's not good for your health.\"\n\nFeng Nü chuckled, \"I'm not a child. I'll control my emotions. You're not thinking of some female confidante again and preparing to confess to me, are you?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled wryly, \"Am I that kind of person? I've already confessed what needed to be confessed. Oh, you! I'll punish you by having no good dishes tonight.\"\n\nFeng Nü shook Nian Bing's hand and said, \"Alright, hurry up and tell me. What is it?\"\n\nNian Bing was just about to speak when a knock suddenly came from outside. \"Nian Bing, are you there?\" It was Rong Bing. His voice sounded a bit helpless.\n\nNian Bing whispered to Feng Nü, \"We'll talk about our matter later. My brother's here.\" After saying this, he got up to open the door. It wasn't just Rong Bing; with him was Hua Yinuo, the Huarong Empire Princess whom Nian Bing had met before. Upon seeing Nian Bing, Yinuo's eyes immediately widened. She then looked at Rong Bing beside her and couldn't help but cover her mouth.\n\nNian Bing looked at his brother in confusion. \"Brother, this is...\"\n\nRong Bing smiled wryly, \"You rascal, you've been wandering around outside with a beautiful girl these past few days, causing me a lot of trouble. See, Yinuo insists I've found a new love. I had no choice but to bring her to see you. Yinuo, I don't need to explain now, do I? The facts are right in front of us.\"\n\nSeeing Rong Bing's helpless expression, Nian Bing couldn't help but burst into laughter. \"So, Sister-in-law misunderstood again. Sister-in-law, I must still thank you for the good thing you gave me last time.\"\n\nYinuo stared blankly until she was in front of Nian Bing. She suddenly raised her hand and pinched Nian Bing's face firmly, even tugging hard. Nian Bing winced in pain and exclaimed, \"Sister-in-law, what are you doing? This face of mine is real!\" Yinuo turned back to look at Rong Bing, making a gesture as if to pinch him. Rong Bing was scared and quickly took two steps back. \"No need to pinch! Didn't you already pinch me on the way here?\"\n\nYinuo said blankly, \"Are you really brothers? And not even twins? How can you look so alike?\"\n\nNian Bing rubbed his face with a wry smile and said, \"Sister-in-law, this appearance is inborn. My brother and I can't change it. Looking alike isn't our fault, as long as we don't enter the wrong bridal chamber in the future, it'll be fine.\"\n\nYinuo's pretty face flushed, and she said huffily, \"It's all your fault! Your brother and I were doing quite well, and who knew another one would pop up? Give me back my brooch!\" As she spoke, she extended her right hand.\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"No. Let that brooch be Sister-in-law's welcoming gift to your little brother. I can't call you 'Sister-in-law' for nothing!\"\n\nYinuo snorted, \"I haven't even married your brother yet. But it's fine if you don't return it. In the future, when you're in Dutian City, you'll have to use that thing to change your appearance, so I won't mistake you again.\" Remembering Nian Bing's remark about entering the wrong bridal chamber, her pretty face couldn't help but redden again, making Nian Bing's smile deepen. \"That's just a matter of time anyway. Please come in quickly.\" Saying this, he stepped aside from the doorway.\n\nYinuo entered first, directly facing Feng Nü, who had stood up. Feng Nü also saw her. When beautiful women meet, they inevitably compare each other. Yinuo blinked her eyes, looked at Feng Nü, and said, \"Hello, I'm Yinuo.\"",

    "content": "She had originally come full of hostility, but the scene at the doorway made Yinuo not know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nThat her beloved actually had such a similar-looking younger brother truly brought her no small surprise.\n\nPhoenix Girl smiled faintly: \"Hello, I am Phoenix Girl. I overheard your conversation at the doorway. When I first arrived in Dutian City, I also misunderstood. However, Nianbing wasn't as lucky as his older brother; he was hit by me for nothing.\" That day, Nianbing's injury wasn't serious, but the bruise on his chest only subsided today. Nianbing, having the moral high ground, made Phoenix Girl massage it for him for several days.\n\nYinuo giggled, walking up to Phoenix Girl, \"You're truly beautiful! I originally thought I was quite good, but I still can't compare to you.\"\n\nRongbing, who entered next, smiled wryly: \"This is also the root of your belly full of jealousy*, isn't it?\"\n\nYinuo turned her head and rolled her eyes at Rongbing, \"Are you disappointed with my appearance, huh?\"\n\nRongbing frowned slightly, saying: \"Why say such things? In front of my younger brother and sister-in-law, just restrain yourself a bit.\" Except when facing Nianbing alone, there was always a hint of coldness on his face.\n\nYinuo pouted her small mouth, saying: \"Restrain what? Phoenix Girl, let's ignore them. Quickly tell me how you mistook them back then.\"\n\nWatching the two young women sit there and chat, Rongbing pulled a book from his bosom: \"Let them chat, let's go for a walk. Things have been too busy these past few days, so I haven't come over.\"\n\nNianbing didn't look at it, directly putting the book into his spatial ring, saying: \"It's alright, you're a young prince, you naturally have many things to be busy with.\" The two brothers talked as they walked out of the inn.\n\nThey found a place to sit in the inn's garden. Nianbing had already changed his appearance with a brooch when he left. \"Brother. You seem to have something on your mind! Is it because of Miss Yinuo?\"\n\nRongbing shook his head, saying: \"Yinuo is a good girl. Although she can be a bit impulsive at times, her nature is very kind. To be able to get such a good wife in a political marriage, I'm already very satisfied. My worry is because of you! Now, some people in the family already know you've returned. Quite a few advocate for putting you under house arrest to search for the whereabouts of the Flame Stone.\"\n\nA cold light flashed in Nianbing's eyes as he said: \"What was Duke Rong's reaction then?\"\n\nRongbing said: \"Grandpa didn't say anything, neither approving nor opposing, only saying that this matter wasn't urgent. You've been away for so many years, there are some things you don't know. The internal struggles within the family are very intense. Grandpa's side is fine; Father's excellence prevents other uncles from ever having inappropriate thoughts. However. Both Second Grandpa and Third Grandpa's lineages have several outstanding uncles, and their desire for power is very great. Now that Grandpa is still alive, everything isn't obvious, but once Grandpa passes away, I'm afraid all contradictions will surface. Dad can barely deter his peers, but Second Grandpa and Third Grandpa are both ten years younger than Grandpa. If they step forward then, everything will be hard to say.\"\n\nNianbing frowned and said: \"Brother, do you really have to get involved in such internal family matters? Power is like floating clouds; I prefer a free and unconstrained life.\"\n\nRongbing sighed softly, saying: \"If only I could be like you, but I can't! You don't understand, there are many things involved when it comes to power. Grandpa decided to let Yinuo and me be together, and one important reason was to connect Father's lineage with the imperial family, so that we could react in time when something truly happens.\"\n\nNianbing thought for a moment, then suddenly looked up and said coldly: \"Brother, actually, solving this problem isn't difficult at all.\"\n\nRongbing looked at him in surprise, \"Oh? You have a way?\"\n\nNianbing said calmly: \"Very simple: military power.\"\n\nRongbing's whole body trembled. \"You mean, you want me to seize military power?\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly: \"Exactly. Nothing is more substantial than military power. If you and Eldest Uncle can both grasp military power, who would dare to touch you? If I were you, I definitely wouldn't stay at home now, but rather ask Grandpa for an external transfer. The Flame Lion Knights are Duke Rong's direct lineage and absolutely loyal to Duke Rong, so you don't need to worry about them at all. As the saying goes, 'the bystander sees clearer than the player*'—if I'm not mistaken, most people in the family are currently targeting the Flame Lion Knights for their plans, but in fact, they're too foolish. As long as Duke Rong makes the final decision, the Flame Lion Knights will absolutely obey. So, you have no need to worry about the imperial capital's side right now. Being transferred out is not only good training for yourself, but also an opportunity to interact more with external legions and build good relationships with them, which will be extremely important for whether you and Eldest Uncle can take over Duke Rong's power in the future.\"\n\nHearing Nianbing's words, a great light shone in Rongbing's eyes. \"It truly is 'the bystander sees clearer'! You're absolutely right. Currently, the only thing our Rong family truly and completely controls is the Central Army Group. Sixty percent of the entire Army Group's senior generals are under Rong family control; even I hold a nominal position as a Deputy Army Group Commander in the Central Army Group. As for the other four major Army Groups, as time extends, while the Rong family's influence is still there, most of them are managed by collateral branches and some of Grandpa's old subordinates. Let me briefly explain the current distribution of power to you. The Central Army Group is divided into three major factions: my father controls one major faction, and his strength is also the strongest. The other two major factions are controlled by the eldest sons of Second Grandpa and Third Grandpa, respectively. Although their individual strengths are not as strong as my father's, combined, they are much stronger. It is precisely because of this subtle relationship that everyone is seeking the support of the Flame Lion Knights. However, the eight Golden Lions of the Flame Lion Knights have never made a clear statement. As you said, they are probably maintaining neutrality under Grandpa's instruction. As for the three external Army Groups, there are no Rong family members fighting among themselves there. After all, they are very far from the imperial capital, and our family's internal strife cannot spread that far, otherwise, His Majesty would definitely notice. Among the three major Army Groups, the Northern Army Group has the strongest combat power; the Southeastern Army Group and the Eastern Army Group are similar. And because Father has participated in battles in the North multiple times with Grandpa, he has good relations with the high-ranking generals of the Northern Army Group; they highly respect Father. When necessary, they will definitely support Father. The current commander of the Southeastern Army Group is Demon Marshal Húguāng. This person is very cunning. And he always plays both sides, and he is not from our Rong family, so it's hard to say.\"\n\nAs soon as Rongbing mentioned Húguāng, Nianbing couldn't help but interject: \"Brother, you don't need to consider the southeast. I've met Demon Marshal Húguāng. He has some special preferences. In my opinion, he's practically a Southern Chrysanthemum*. He and a friend I know could be called the Two Great Chrysanthemums of North and South. If you were transferred there, with your looks, I'm afraid...\"\n\nRongbing felt a chill run through his body upon hearing this, and chuckled wryly: \"Húguāng's special preferences are already common knowledge, but he truly is capable. His current status was entirely climbed up step by step by himself, so you absolutely must not underestimate this person. His ruthlessness is ingrained. Nianbing, you weren't harassed by him, were you?\"\n\nNianbing shrugged, saying: \"Not that. However, I don't want to see him again. Since neither the North nor the Southeast can be chosen, then only the Eastern Army Group remains. But that place borders the Qilu Empire; I'm afraid promotion won't be easy there!\"\n\nRongbing sneered, saying: \"Don't think that the relationship between our Huarong Empire and the Qilu Empire is that good. Many interests are involved. It's just that the Qilu Empire is not as strong as us, so it appears to have always been dependent on us. In reality, the King of the Qilu Empire is a very ambitious fellow. Once he seizes an opportunity, he could be detrimental to us at any time. The Huarong Empire is currently the number one empire on the Yangguang Continent, and also the target of public criticism; the surrounding empires are all watching us. That's why the last military operation against the Olan Empire involved the Qilu Empire, and we gave them many benefits. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been so easy. Although Huarong is strong, it can't contend with the entire continent, just like the current Central Army Group: one side is strong, but surrounded by two others. Although the Langmu and Qilu nations are not on good terms, if we were to commit all our forces against either side, considering the 'if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold*' relationship, the other side would probably act immediately.\"\n\nNianbing thought for a moment, then nodded: \"So the situation is this complicated. No wonder the Olan Empire, despite being so weak and vulnerable, hasn't been destroyed. The five empires on the Yangguang Continent are like links in a chain; pulling one affects the whole situation. Even if the Huarong Empire could simultaneously deal with two neighboring countries, I'm afraid it wouldn't dare to act rashly.\"\n\nRongbing smiled faintly: \"I won't hide it from you, actually, our warlike Grandpa has long thought about unifying the continent. Even the strategy is already set: nothing more than 'ally with distant states and attack nearby ones*.' However, there has always been only one thing restraining him, and that is the existence of the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess. No one knows her formidable strength better than Grandpa. As long as the Ice God Tower exists, it's impossible for the Huarong Empire to rule the entire continent. Perhaps others fear our Flame Lion Knights, but the Ice God Tower, with hundreds of Ice and Snow Mages, is not afraid. The continent's current peace, from certain perspectives, is largely due to the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's feat of destroying one hundred thousand soldiers with a super-tier forbidden spell.\"\n\nNianbing clenched his fists. \"Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, one day, I will make her die by my hand.\"\n\nRongbing sighed, saying: \"I understand the hatred in your heart, but you must not act rashly before you're confident. Oh, by the way, there's something else I need to tell you. I heard Grandpa say that you're already a Magus, and you can use multi-element magic. But, do you know why you didn't have the slightest chance when you fought Grandpa that day?\"\n\nNianbing shook his head blankly. \"That's right! Even if the opponent was a Magus, I had already desperately used all the strongest magic I could, so why did I still lose so terribly in the end? Could there be some secret in this?\"\n\nRongbing lowered his voice, saying: \"Because, three years ago, Grandpa also finally reached that level.\"\n\nNianbing's whole body trembled violently, his eyes widening in shock. \"Brother, are you saying, he also...\"\n\nRongbing made a silencing gesture, saying: \"This is our Rong family's biggest secret. Besides Grandpa's few confidants, me, Father, and Second Grandpa and Third Grandpa, no one else knows. Even Emperor Huatian isn't clear about Grandpa's current strength. Think about it, that day you faced Grandpa's self-created eleventh-tier forbidden spell, the Purple Flame Demon Lion. How could you have had a chance? That was Grandpa holding back, allowing you to keep your life.\"\n\nThis news greatly shocked Nianbing. He never expected that Duke Rong, who seemed much older than before, would actually make another breakthrough in his old age, reaching the realm of a God Descendant Master. No wonder he didn't even have a sliver of a chance. Although a Magus is considered an outstanding figure among mages, how could one contend with a God Descendant Master of the highest level?\n\n\"Brother, then do you think Grandpa can contend with the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess?\"\n\nRongbing smiled wryly: \"Until they meet again, no one can say for sure. However, the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess has been a God Descendant Master for more than just a day or two. Ice and fire mutually restrain each other; whoever wants to claim victory depends on the depth of their strength. Frankly speaking, I'm not very optimistic about Grandpa. But, compared to that battle back then, Grandpa's chances are much greater. Nianbing, this is an absolute family secret, but I'm not afraid to tell you. Although you're unwilling to admit it now, deep down, you're still a Rong family member. Blood is thicker than water*; the Rong clan's blood flows in your veins. I won't try to persuade you, but I'll always be waiting for you to come back.\"\n\nNianbing fell silent. Although he was unwilling to admit it, his heart trembled with a hint of pride. \"Brother, thank you for telling me this. Perhaps, one day, when Eldest Uncle is in power in the Rong family, I'll return. I hate the Rong family, I hate Duke Rong, but after all, they are not my enemies.\"\n\nRongbing patted Nianbing's shoulder, a faint smile appearing on his face. \"We should go back; they've probably chatted enough by now. I'll remember what you said. After this Newcomer Mage Competition ends, I'll ask Grandpa for an external transfer. I'll go to the Eastern Army Group. I hope to gain something there.\"\n\nThe two stood up and started walking back. Just then, a warning sign suddenly rose in Nianbing's heart. He subconsciously looked in one direction. Rongbing also felt Nianbing's unease and followed his gaze, but only saw a few faint figures.\n\n\"This is bad. Quickly, back!\" Nianbing cried out in alarm, running towards the inn at his fastest speed. Because what he had sensed earlier was the aura of the Phoenix Clan.\n\nRongbing followed closely behind Nianbing, but before running far, he found himself getting farther and farther from Nianbing. He thought to himself, 'Is my younger brother really a mage? How is his body as good as a warrior's?'\n\nNianbing was, of course, a mage. However, his body had been modified by Fire Dragon King Galamandis, making it much tougher than an ordinary person's. This allowed for better cultivation of advanced magic.\n\nThe Nianbing brothers hadn't walked far. Soon, Nianbing returned to the inn. Without any delay, he rushed towards his room, but just as he reached the doorway, he was blocked by two people. They were two young men dressed in white warrior attire. They shared a common characteristic: long, fiery red hair. White clothes and red hair, coupled with their handsome appearance, made them look imposing and heroic.\n\n\"Get out of the way.\" Nianbing's voice, cold, gained a hint of anger.\n\nThe two young men merely looked up at him, but didn't utter a sound, naturally also not meaning to move aside*.\n\nNianbing grew furious. He could imagine what was happening inside. Not only was Phoenix Girl, whom he deeply loved, in the room, but also his brother's lover. Whatever happened to anyone, it was unimaginable for him. Phoenix Girl had run away secretly; given the Phoenix Clan's past actions, would they let Phoenix Girl off?\n\nWithout any hesitation, the Roar of the God of Flame and the Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess simultaneously appeared in Nianbing's hands. Two auras, ice and fire, instantly rose. At this moment, Nianbing was exceptionally terrifying. Behind him, two different colors simultaneously lit up: the Phoenix Clan member on the left felt a cold aura, while the Phoenix Clan member on the right felt the exact opposite, a scorching flame. One ice, one fire. The simultaneous appearance of two extremes immediately caused them to show surprise.\n\n\"Are you going to move or not? I don't mind tearing this inn down.\" Nianbing's voice seemed to come from the Nine Netherworlds. For Phoenix Girl, he would do anything.\n\n\"Nianbing, no!\" Just at this critical moment, Phoenix Girl's voice came from the room. Phoenix Girl and Yinuo were seen walking out of the room with three other people. Nianbing recognized two of those three Phoenix Clan members: one was Fengxiang, who had tried to assassinate him last time. The other was Elder Fengkong, who had fought him to a mutually destructive draw. Both their expressions were not very pleasant. The three Phoenix Clan members formed a triangular encirclement around Phoenix Girl and Yinuo.\n\n\"What happened?\" Rongbing rushed back.\n\nFengkong and Fengxiang simultaneously gasped in surprise, \"Ah! You're not dead!\"\n\nNianbing was stunned for a moment. He immediately understood that they had mistaken him for someone else. At this point, he couldn't care about anything else. He didn't want either Rongbing, Phoenix Girl, or Yinuo to suffer the slightest harm. He immediately pressed the brooch on his chest, revealing his original appearance. \"That's right, I'm not dead. As long as I'm alive, don't even think about taking Phoenix Girl away.\"\n\nRongbing looked coldly at the five Phoenix Clan members in front of him. He said calmly: \"Nianbing, this is our territory. Without my permission, no one* can take anyone away.\"\n\nFengxiang snorted, saying: \"Two people saying the same thing*, what are you? You say we can't take her, so we won't take her?\"\n\nRongbing looked at the bright and beautiful Fengxiang as if she were a lifeless object, and snorted disdainfully, saying: \"Since the establishment of the Huarong Empire, only one person has been able to freely take our people from this Dutian City: the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess. Unless you believe you can reach that level of strength, otherwise, who do you think you can take away?\"\n\nElder Fengkong stopped Fengxiang, who was about to act, saying: \"Your Excellency's tone seems a bit too arrogant. Phoenix Girl is our clan member; irrelevant people, please leave. Otherwise, it will be hard for me to guarantee no harm*.\" His tone was very calm, but he inadvertently exuded a powerful aura, secretly surprising Rongbing.\n\nRongbing had seen many strong individuals. From the aura Fengkong emitted, he easily recognized that this elder warrior was likely a Martial Saint-level master. Facing such a master, Rongbing felt no fear in his heart. What kind of existence was the Rong family in the entire Huarong Empire? As a young prince, he had seen many grand occasions. Moreover, the other party was currently holding a sitting Imperial Princess* of the Huarong Empire hostage. Just based on his and Yinuo's identities, let alone if the opponent only had one Martial Saint, even if they had ten, they might not be able to take anyone from this Dutian City.\n\nA trace of sadness appeared in Phoenix Girl's eyes. She calmly looked at Nianbing and said: \"Nianbing, please don't stop the elder and my clan members, okay? Elder Kong has already promised me that he won't make things difficult for anyone, as long as they only take me. Do you remember what I told you on the first day we met? Wait for me, okay?\"\n\nAs soon as Phoenix Girl uttered these words, Nianbing felt a sharp pain in his heart. His handsome face seemed to spasm slightly from anger. If he couldn't even protect the woman he loved most, then could he still be considered a man? At this moment, he didn't realize that the eyes of the three young men Fengkong brought, besides Fengxiang, all showed anger. Phoenix Girl was the Phoenix Clan's most beautiful woman, naturally the object of these young men's pursuit. However, they never expected that Phoenix Girl would fall for an outsider and even betray her clan and flee for this outsider. Their hatred for Nianbing had long since unknowingly developed.\n\n\"No, today, unless I die, no one will take you away from here.\" Nianbing's voice was firm and decisive, leaving no room for negotiation. He secretly swore in his heart that even if he had to use curse magic, he absolutely would not let Phoenix Girl leave his side.\n\nRongbing pressed Nianbing's shoulder, saying: \"Younger brother, calm down a bit. Don't worry, as long as we're in Dutian City, no one will be harmed.\"\n\nYinuo giggled as if she weren't being held captive, saying: \"Yes! But, today was really thrilling and exciting! I haven't experienced this feeling in a long time.\"\n\nRongbing frowned, saying: \"Yinuo, stop messing around. Old Sir, I'll give you one last chance: release our people, and I can let you leave safely. Otherwise, you'll be responsible for the consequences yourselves.\"\n\nFengkong said calmly: \"I've never been afraid of any consequences. Young man, don't speak so rashly. Move aside; we are leaving.\" If he hadn't been holding them back, the four young Phoenix Clan experts he brought would have already made a move. Although Fengkong was very thoughtful, this was, after all, the capital of the Huarong Empire, with heavily guarded* defenses, and the continent-famous Flame Lion Knights. It was naturally best not to alarm the authorities.\n\nRongbing smiled, his smile was very cold, his gaze flashing like lightning.\n\nYinuo let out a giggle, saying: \"There you go again, Rongbing. Do you know that the way you smile is uglier than crying?\"\n\nRongbing's face stiffened, and he said with slight annoyance: \"What time is it, and you're still in the mood for jokes?\"\n\nYinuo pouted her lips, lowering her head and saying: \"Alright, I won't cause trouble then. First Grandpa, Second Grandpa! Come out quickly! Someone's bullying Nuonuo! If you don't come soon, I'll go back and tell Father on you!\"\n\nHearing Yinuo's words, Fengkong couldn't help but be startled. 'Are there other people ambushing* around here? I didn't sense anything with my cultivation!'?\n\nJust then, two figures, one green and one gray, drifted in. Although Fengkong reacted, he only managed to block one of the figures, with a dull thud. The entire inn trembled. Nianbing only felt a blur before his eyes; Yinuo had already left her previous spot and, together with the gray figure, appeared beside Rongbing.\n\nElder Fengkong took a step back, a great light shining in his eyes. \"Good cultivation!\"\n\nThe green figure retreated in front of Yinuo, saying calmly: \"You're not bad either. Your Nine-Parting Dou Qi is very profound. May I ask, which elder of the Phoenix Clan are you?\"\n\nA trace of surprise appeared in Fengkong's eyes. He clearly hadn't expected his identity to be recognized so easily by the other party. But as an elder of the Phoenix Clan, he was always known for his composure. He smiled calmly and said: \"I am Fengkong. May I ask who you two are?\"\n\nAt this moment, Nianbing had clearly seen the owners of the two figures. They were two old men, appearing to be over seventy years old, with white beards and hair. Their appearances were ordinary, no different from typical elders, but their gazes were exceptionally sharp, their eyes like tangible entities. Even with Nianbing's impressive mental strength, he couldn't help but slightly avert his gaze when meeting theirs. Nianbing's heart was awestruck. Zhaji had once told him that no matter the profession, the more ordinary-looking a person appeared, the more likely they were to be a top master. Weren't these two old men exactly that? Their appearances showed nothing peculiar, but just one of them could fight Fengkong to a draw. Although this was without Fengkong using his Phoenix Transformation, such strength definitely deserved the title of Martial Saint.\n\nThe old man in green robes smiled calmly, saying: \"Elder Fengkong needn't inquire. We are merely the young mistress's house servants.\"\n\nYinuo pouted her small mouth in a spoiled manner and said: \"Who said that? You're clearly my First Grandpa and Second Grandpa! Even my own Grandpa calls you brothers!\"\n\nFengkong saw that the two Martial Saint-level masters before him actually referred to themselves as servants. Then, looking at the formidable Nianbing and Rongbing, he knew it would probably be very difficult to take Phoenix Girl today. Just these two Martial Saints in front of him were already difficult to deal with, let alone the opponent having a powerful mage like Nianbing. If Phoenix Girl were to turn against them, their side might not be able to retreat unscathed.\n\nJust as Fengkong was weighing the pros and cons, Rongbing spoke: \"I think you few can leave now. I don't know what the Phoenix Clan is, but I do know that this is the capital of the Huarong Empire. For the sake of you being Phoenix Girl's clan members, I won't make things difficult for you this time. If I see you again, don't blame me for being impolite.\"\n\nFengkong, seeing Rongbing's overbearing tone, couldn't help but feel his anger surge. He said coldly: \"Alright, we'll leave for now today. However, just who is Your Excellency? Another day, I shall have to ask for enlightenment. The dignity of the Phoenix Clan brooks no insult from anyone.\"\n\nRongbing said calmly: \"'He who insults others shall be insulted by others*.' My name is Rongbing. If you wish for revenge, you are welcome to come to Duke Rong's Mansion to find me. Just state my name*, and everyone in the mansion will know.\"\n\nFengkong gasped, drawing a cold breath. Although he wasn't very familiar with external affairs, how could he not know about the Rong family of the Huarong Empire? Looking at Rongbing's demeanor, there was no need to ask: his status in the Rong family was naturally not low. And Nianbing, being so similar in appearance to him, was probably also a member of the Rong family. It seemed that his mission to capture Phoenix Girl this time would not be easy to complete!\n\nNianbing smiled calmly, saying: \"Elder Fengkong, before you leave, I'll repeat what I said earlier: unless I'm dead, otherwise, don't even think about taking Phoenix Girl from my side.\"\n\nFengxiang and the other four were enraged. They simultaneously took a step forward, and the scorching aura of Nine-Parting Dou Qi surged out, enveloping Nianbing and Rongbing.\n\nThe Nianbing brothers showed no fear. They also stepped forward. Nianbing's Ice-Fire Homologous Magic combined with Rongbing's formidable Flame Magic was not at a disadvantage when confronting the four. In terms of aura, neither side could overwhelm the other.\n\nFengkong looked deeply at Phoenix Girl, then sighed: \"Child, take care of yourself. Let's go.\" Saying that, he led Fengxiang and the others outside. Nianbing and Rongbing did not stop them, allowing them to leave. Watching their retreating figures, Nianbing's eyes flashed repeatedly. He already had no good impression of the Phoenix Clan, and this time, with the Phoenix Clan sending people to capture Phoenix Girl again, this ill feeling became even stronger than before. A mysterious bloodthirsty aura rose in his chest.\n\n\"Little Princess, it's alright now. Shouldn't you come back to the palace with us?\" The old man in green robes looked at Yinuo somewhat helplessly.\n\nYinuo thought for a moment, then said: \"Alright, it really is getting late. Rongbing, I'm going back now. Remember to find me to play, okay? Phoenix Girl, goodbye. I was really happy to meet you today*. I'm leaving now. First Grandpa, Second Grandpa, let's go.\"\n\nA hint of tenderness appeared in Rongbing's eyes. \"Be careful on the way. Don't be so playful and cause trouble for* the two Grandpas again, alright?\"\n\nYinuo said somewhat unhappily: \"I know, I'm not a child! Oh, by the way, you, the guy who looks just like Rongbing, you better remember, you owe me one! When you think about repaying it later, I'll need a big, big gift!\" After saying that, with a smile, she left with the two old men.\n\nWatching Yinuo's departing back, Nianbing couldn't help but smile: \"Brother, you've really found a cheerful sister-in-law.\"\n\nRongbing shook his head helplessly, saying: \"She grew up in the imperial family and was extremely favored by Emperor Huatian, so naturally, she doesn't know what sorrow or sadness is. She's always like a child.\" Unknowingly, a hint of doting indulgence appeared in his tone.\n\nNianbing stepped forward and took Phoenix Girl's hand, a pang in his heart as he saw her somewhat lost expression. He said: \"They didn't make things difficult for you, did they? Are you hurt?\"\n\nPhoenix Girl shook her head, saying: \"Elder Kong and the others had just arrived when you rushed back. I'm fine. Big Brother Rongbing, thank you this time.\"\n\nRongbing smiled faintly, saying: \"What's there to thank for, sister-in-law? Rest assured and stay here. As long as I'm around, no one will dare to harm you. This is Dutian City, not like other places. I don't think they'll come again.\"\n\nPhoenix Girl sighed softly, saying: \"I can't stay here with Nianbing forever. Elder Fengkong and the others won't give up.\"\n\nNianbing squeezed Phoenix Girl's hand, saying: \"Don't worry, as long as I'm here, they won't be able to take you.\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n*   \"Belly full of jealousy\" (吃了一肚子醋): A Chinese idiom literally meaning \"to eat a belly full of vinegar,\" used to describe someone who is very jealous.\n*   \"The bystander sees clearer than the player\" (當局者迷旁觀者清): A Chinese proverb meaning that it's easier to see the truth or find a solution when one is not directly involved in a situation.\n*   \"Southern Chrysanthemum\" (南菊花): A vulgar Chinese slang term. \"Chrysanthemum\" (菊花) is slang for anus.

    "title": "Chapter 103: Natural Magician (Part 1)",
    "content": "Feng Nü smiled wryly: \"I'm just afraid of you! Elder Feng Kong has always been very good to me, treating me like a father since I was little. This time, for your sake, I fled my home and came here. They traveled great distances to chase after me, only to be forced away like this. I'm afraid the elders will feel terrible, and even more unwilling to accept you, Nian Bing. Can you understand my heart? To me, my clan members are just as important!\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Feng Nü, I understand the responsibility you feel, but don't think too much about it for now. This matter will be resolved sooner or later. I will let you return to the Phoenix Clan, but absolutely not by being captured and dragged back by them like this. Promise me, don't leave, okay?\" He was truly afraid of that feeling of waking from meditation only to find Feng Nü gone.\n\nFeng Nü gazed deeply at Nian Bing, then gently nodded.\n\nRong Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Nian Bing, the book I gave you today is one I selected and transcribed. With the previous one, it should be enough for you. Yesterday, Grandfather just looked for me and told me to enter seclusion for a month to prepare for the upcoming competition. I probably won't be able to see you two during this time. However, you can rest assured about the safety here. I think even without me, Grandfather would never allow outsiders to harm his own people within Du Tian City. Alright, I'm off. You two enjoy your sweet time.\" After speaking, he turned and left.\n\nWatching Rong Bing's retreating figure, Nian Bing couldn't help but murmur, \"Brother, thank you.\" He naturally understood Rong Bing's meaning: Rong Bing intended to use the Rong family's influence to protect them. If Nian Bing were alone, he would never accept such kindness from Rong Bing. However, now with Feng Nü, his greatest fear was Feng Nü being taken away by Feng Kong and the others, so he could only tacitly accept Rong Bing's offer. He held Feng Nü's hand and returned to the room.\n\nBack in the room, Feng Nü was still a bit sad. Nian Bing hugged her and comforted her for a long time before she felt a little better.\n\n\"Nian Bing, didn't you say you had something to tell me earlier? There's no one else here now, so speak.\" Feng Nü recalled what had happened before.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Actually, it's nothing. I was just teasing you. I just wanted to ask what good food you'd like to eat today, so I can make it for you! Feng Nü, what kind of look is that? It's really scary. Ah! Don't pinch me! I didn't mean to tease you.\"\n\nAmidst Nian Bing's jokes, Feng Nü finally emerged from her earlier sadness. At this point, Nian Bing had decided not to help Feng Nü with the blood recognition ritual* for now. Firstly, he hoped Feng Nü could live happily here for a period, staying with him. Although this was out of selfishness, it was also to prevent Feng Nü from being captured and taken back by Feng Kong and the others. In fact, he had to participate in the Magician's Tournament and couldn't leave until after it concluded. He would tell Feng Nü about this matter after the tournament ended. If Feng Nü truly was Yu Ru Yan's daughter, then he would personally escort Feng Nü back to Yu Ru Yan. As long as Yu Ru Yan was there, Feng Nü's safety would be absolutely guaranteed. Considering these points, he decided not to mention it for the time being. There was still over a month, and during this time, he wanted to live carefree with Feng Nü.\n\n*Translator's Note: The \"blood recognition ritual\" (滴血認親) is a traditional method, often involving dripping blood into water to see if it merges, believed to determine biological familial ties.\n\nAs Rong Bing had said, after Elder Feng Kong and his group were driven away, Feng Nü and Nian Bing were no longer bothered by the Phoenix Clan. Their lives began to fall into a routine. Every morning, both would awaken simultaneously from their cultivation states, go out together to buy groceries, and stroll hand-in-hand through Du Tian City, only returning to the inn around noon. Lunch would be personally prepared by Nian Bing.\n\nEvery day, Nian Bing would prepare delicious food for Feng Nü in different ways to make her happy. After lunch, Nian Bing would insist Feng Nü take a nap. He told Feng Nü that napping was very good for a girl's complexion. Feng Nü couldn't refuse him and had to start sleeping. At first, she was a bit unaccustomed to it, but after more than ten days, if she didn't nap at noon, Feng Nü would actually feel tired. Under Nian Bing's care, Feng Nü appeared increasingly beautiful and captivating.\n\nAfter Feng Nü fell asleep at noon, Nian Bing would begin studying the magic books Rong Bing had given him. During this period, perhaps because Feng Nü was by his side, he found his comprehension to be even more agile than before. He could find solutions to some very difficult problems just by thinking carefully, and he even managed to repair several damaged ancient magic arrays using various methods.\n\nWhen Feng Nü woke up, the two would leave the inn together and find a quiet place to watch the sun set. Whenever this happened, neither of them would speak, enjoying the not-very-long tranquility. They both had a feeling that as they watched the sun set, their hearts seemed to connect. Without speaking, they could understand each other's feelings.\n\nAfter returning to the inn, Nian Bing would again personally cook dinner. After a delightful meal, they would begin their most important daily cultivation. Nian Bing meditated, while Feng Nü cultivated Battle Qi. Although they never explicitly said it, Feng Nü always remained awake during her cultivation to guard Nian Bing, allowing him to cultivate with greater peace of mind.\n\nTime passed quickly; beautiful times always do. Over a month went by in a flash. Nian Bing and Feng Nü had grown accustomed to each other's presence. Every day, opening their eyes to see the other filled their hearts with immense satisfaction, as if that alone was enough, as if in the whole world, only they existed.\n\n\"Nian Bing, it's time to register today,\" Rong Bing's voice rang out from outside the room door.\n\nNian Bing had just awakened from meditation. As he watched Feng Nü, who was still meditating, he heard his brother's voice and couldn't help but chuckle inwardly, \"Brother sure came early!\" He quietly got up, careful not to disturb Feng Nü, opened the door, and walked out.\n\n\"Shh, Brother, let's talk outside. Feng Nü is still meditating.\"\n\nRong Bing had changed into a brand-new, spotless white robe today. He smiled and nodded, and the two turned and left the inn.\n\n\"Nian Bing, you look like you're living quite comfortably! Your complexion is really good. Men with women are just different,\" Rong Bing couldn't help but tease him the moment he saw Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing smiled wryly, \"Brother, when did you become so gossipy? Just now I heard you at the door saying it's time to register today. Does that mean the competition starts tomorrow?\"\n\nRong Bing was momentarily stunned, then said, \"You brat are truly lost in pleasure*, aren't you? Don't you know the competition is the day after tomorrow? Today is the last day for registration. If you don't register in time, you'll be disqualified.\"\n\n*Translator's Note: \"Lost in pleasure\" (樂不思蜀) is an idiom describing someone so engrossed in enjoyment that they forget about their duties or where they came from.\n\nNian Bing scratched his head and said, \"I really didn't know the exact date of the competition. I originally intended to inquire, but I've been feeling good about my meditation these past few days, so I forgot.\"\n\nRong Bing rolled his eyes and said, \"You're something else! It's not because of meditation; I think it's clearly because of Feng Nü, isn't it? But, brother, I must warn you, even though you're still young, you need to take care of your body! Too much bedroom activity isn't advisable.\"\n\nNian Bing retorted irritably, \"Brother, you sound like you know a lot about it. Feng Nü and I are pure, aren't you and sister-in-law already...\"\n\nRong Bing knocked him on the head and said, \"What 'sister-in-law'?! Yi Nuo and I aren't married yet. Stop being so glib, let's go quickly! If you miss the registration, what competition will you even participate in?\"\n\nThe two brothers, Nian Bing and Rong Bing, walked from their lodgings towards the city. As they walked, Rong Bing said to Nian Bing, \"This year's Five Nations Newcomer Magician's Tournament is being held in the Imperial Palace. This isn't just an ordinary competition; it's an important opportunity to showcase the strength of each nation.\"\n\nNian Bing asked in surprise, \"Held within the Imperial Palace? Is it not open to the public?\"\n\nRong Bing said, \"Of course it's not open to the public. Otherwise, with so many powerful magicians, accidental harm to commoners would inevitably lead to massive casualties. The competition will be held in a specialized area. At that time, elites from the Imperial Magician Corps will jointly cast a barrier to ensure the safety of the competition. Furthermore, for this kind of competition, Emperor Huatian will personally observe. Cheer for me.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and asked, \"Then who is the other participant from the Hua Rong Empire?\"\n\nRong Bing said, \"Due to the twenty-five-year-old age limit, the Hua Rong Empire's other participant is also one of our Rong family members. Moreover, this person is very familiar to you. Among our third generation, his reputation is second only to mine. You should know who it is?\"\n\nA cold glint flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. He immediately recalled memories from his childhood. At that time, among their generation, although Rong Bing was the eldest, the age difference among his peers was very small. Among them, there were seven or eight who were the same age as Rong Bing. Among these, the most outstanding was Rong Ji, the eldest grandson of Rong Prince's second uncle, who was also Rong Bing's second grandfather. His name was Rong Ji.\n\nRong Ji was only one month younger than Rong Bing. From a young age, he was very cold towards people, never showing even a hint of emotion to anyone. He only knew how to diligently cultivate magic every day. Nian Bing remembered him so clearly because once, when he was playing as a child, he happened to encounter a few of his third grandfather's grandsons. Those third-generation Rong family members were very disdainful of Nian Bing's identity, cursing him as a mongrel. Nian Bing angrily fought with them, but although they were the same age, the opponents had the advantage in numbers, so how could he win? Fortunately, Rong Ji passed by. Rong Ji didn't say much; relying on his strength from having entered the realm of magic early, he scared those children away with a Fireball spell. When Nian Bing thanked him, he simply ignored him and left. From then on, among his peers, Nian Bing bore no ill will towards Rong Ji, just as he didn't towards Rong Bing.\n\nHe snapped out of his memories. Nian Bing smiled faintly, \"Is it Rong Ji? He's not as cold as he seems on the surface! He just doesn't like to talk much.\"\n\nRong Bing smiled faintly and said, \"That fellow is a blockhead. However, he's much more diligent than I am. He's always been taught magic by Second Grandfather, so I don't know what stage his cultivation has reached now. Perhaps he might even be above me. If you encounter him, you must be careful. Rong Ji is extremely warlike, and once he starts fighting an opponent, his frenzied intensity is enough to make his opponent tremble. Before you came, my biggest opponent in this competition, besides the representative from the Ice God Tower, would probably have been this very brother of ours.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"I actually hope to encounter Rong Ji. Being able to spar with him would be a good thing for me.\" Although he was very confident about this magic competition, he absolutely did not wish for weak opponents. If that were the case, what would be the meaning of the competition? Only by competing against experts could he better improve his own strength. Through several battles against powerful individuals, Nian Bing had long understood this principle.\n\nFrom a distance, the magnificent Imperial Palace was already in sight. Its vermilion palace walls stood three *zhang* high*, and a guard stood every two *zhang* along the walls. On the surface, the Imperial Palace's defenses appeared much stronger than those of the Rong Prince's Estate.\n\n*Translator's Note: A *zhang* (丈) is a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or 10.9 feet.\n\nWhen they arrived at the Imperial Palace entrance, Nian Bing noticed a table set up to the right of the gate. Eight imposing soldiers stood on either side of the table, and a person sat behind the desk. This person was thin and small, his official uniform appearing very loose on him, yet he deliberately put on a very majestic air.\n\nRong Bing gave Nian Bing a look, and Nian Bing immediately understood: this was the registration area. The two brothers strode towards the table. The moment they got close, they were immediately stopped by the soldiers on either side.\n\n\"How dare you, you fools! Don't you even recognize Young Prince Rong?!\" The thin, small official quickly stood up, walked around the table, and came to greet them. He didn't even glance at Nian Bing, his face full of fawning flattery as he looked at Rong Bing and said, \"Young Prince, what brings you here? Our own country's participants don't need to come here to register.\"\n\nRong Bing said coolly, \"I'm not here to register myself. I've brought a friend; he's also participating in this competition.\"\n\nOnly then did the official look at Nian Bing. Although Nian Bing had used a brooch to change his appearance and color, his tall and straight figure and noble demeanor were incomparable to ordinary people. Nian Bing gave a slight bow and said, \"Hello, I'm here to register.\" As he spoke, he took out his registration token from his spatial ring.\n\nWhen the official saw the number \"Ten\" on the token, he couldn't help but be stunned. He looked at Nian Bing, then at Rong Bing, and tentatively asked, \"Are you representing the Ice Moon Empire's Magicians' Guild?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"That's right. I am the participant representing the Ice Moon Empire's Magicians' Guild. Is there a problem?\"\n\n\"No, no.\" Because Nian Bing was brought by Rong Bing, the official was exceptionally polite to him. But as he took the token to his desk, he couldn't help but murmur to himself, \"How strange. The Rong family is clearly a major adversary of the Ice Moon Empire, so why would Young Prince Rong bring a participant from the Ice Moon Empire's Magicians' Guild to register?\"\n\nSoon, the registration was complete. The official informed Nian Bing of the competition schedule and format. This competition would be divided into two groups. While ensuring that the two participants from each country were not in the same group, lots would be drawn to divide them into Group One and Group Two, followed by a round-robin tournament.",

    "content": "Everyone would compete against the four other contestants in their group. The top two from each group would then be determined for the finals. The finals would be single-elimination, with the first-place contestant from Group 1 facing the second-place contestant from Group 2, and the first-place contestant from Group 2 facing the second-place contestant from Group 1. These two final matches would determine the ultimate rankings, and new rank plates would be issued based on the results of all matches.\n\nNian Bing wasn't interested in the rank plate from the previous competition. He only knew that the one returning to his hand this round would definitely not be number ten.\n\nAfter registration, Rong Bing smiled slightly, \"That porridge pot we had last time was good, wasn't it? Today, I'll take you to another place to eat. This time it's still porridge, but we'll be drinking it directly. The taste is equally special.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"That's great! But, Brother, I need to go back and get Feng Nü first.\"\n\nRong Bing laughed, \"Of course. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to eat peacefully.\"\n\nJust then, a sudden voice startled Nian Bing. \"Nian Bing, what are you doing here?\" The voice was filled with pleasant surprise. Nian Bing looked up and couldn't help but realize that the person arriving was someone he didn't wish to see. Three carriages, escorted by a small squad of Ice Moon Empire soldiers, arrived before them. Leading them was none other than Yan Feng, the Seventh Imperial Prince of the Ice Moon Empire.\n\nYan Feng's gaze wasn't on Nian Bing; he was looking at Rong Bing. Rong Bing knew the other party had misunderstood again. He subconsciously glanced at Nian Bing, and Nian Bing shot him a look. Although the two brothers hadn't been reunited for long, they had already formed a good rapport. Rong Bing immediately understood Nian Bing's meaning. His face instantly reverted to its usual coldness, and he said indifferently, \"Who are you?\"\n\nYan Feng was stunned for a moment. He said, \"Nian Bing, don't you recognize me? I'm Yan Feng! The clothes you're wearing today are truly handsome.\"\n\nRong Bing said coldly, \"You've probably mistaken me for someone else. I'm not Nian Bing; my surname is Rong.\" As he spoke, he raised a finger and pointed to the Golden Lion emblem on his left chest.\n\nYan Feng saw the roaring posture of the Golden Lion and immediately felt a chill in his heart. His expression changed. \"You, you're from the Rong family? You're really not Nian Bing?\"\n\nRong Bing glanced at the carriage behind Yan Feng. \"You're here to register on behalf of the Ice God Tower, aren't you?\"\n\nJust then, a clear and calm voice came from inside the carriage. \"Your Highness, he is indeed not that Nian Bing. Look at his hands.\"\n\nHearing that voice, Nian Bing and Rong Bing were both startled. The clear voice sounded so captivating, yet it carried a chill from its very core, making one feel a coldness from the bottom of their heart. More importantly, this voice had already pointed out the difference between Rong Bing and Nian Bing. Nian Bing subconsciously drew his hands into his sleeves. Yan Feng's gaze, however, fell on Rong Bing's hands.\n\nIndeed, Rong Bing's hands, though equally slender, lacked the powerful feel of Nian Bing's hands, and even more so, that lustrous quality. It would be difficult to tell the difference without close observation. Yan Feng nodded. He turned back and bowed to the carriage, saying, \"Thank you, Miss Bing Yun, for your guidance.\" After speaking, he turned back to Rong Bing and said, \"I'm truly sorry, I've mistaken you for someone else. However, you do bear a striking resemblance to a friend of mine.\"\n\nRong Bing said nothing. He and Nian Bing walked back the way they came. As they passed the three carriages, both couldn't help but gaze deeply at the ice flower emblem. They both knew that the strongest opponent in this New Talent Magic Competition was within those carriages.\n\nLeaving the Imperial Palace, Rong Bing's brows furrowed occasionally as they walked. He asked Nian Bing, \"Brother, what do you think of the woman in that carriage just now? Her name seems to be Bing Yun. Why didn't you acknowledge your friend just now?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly, \"That is indeed my friend. However, I'm genuinely a bit afraid of him. Not afraid of him as a person, but afraid of his peculiar interests.\"\n\nRong Bing looked at Nian Bing in surprise, \"What peculiar interests?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly, \"Isn't it the same as that Magic Commander Huguang?\"\n\nRong Bing was stunned for a moment, then burst into loud laughter, doubling over until Nian Bing gave a few annoyed coughs, only then did he stop. He chuckled, \"It seems being too handsome isn't always a good thing. No wonder he took a liking to you.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Now I've changed my appearance, but your appearance is just like mine, Brother. You should be careful, he might change his affections! He has a nickname, Yan Chrysanthemum.\" After saying this, he watched Rong Bing's expression gradually change, then continued, \"Actually, aside from that peculiar interest, Yan Feng is a very good person. Although he's a prince, he has no air of haughtiness. While he may appear aloof, I can see the loneliness in his heart. He's the Seventh Imperial Prince of the Ice Moon Empire, and his personally escorting the Ice God Tower's contestants this time isn't because the Ice Moon Empire attaches so much importance to the competition, but rather to escape the internal disputes within the Ice Moon Empire's royal family!\"\n\nRong Bing said, impressed, \"To be able to distance oneself from immense power – this person is remarkable. Seeing through fame and fortune is not an easy feat.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"Brother, when I met Yan Feng a few days ago, I heard him say that the young lady representing the Ice God Tower in this competition is named Bing Yun, known as 'Thousand Illusions.' From what I can tell, she probably also has the strength of an Archmage. She's definitely not easy to deal with, so if you encounter her, you must be careful.\"\n\n\"Thousand Illusions Bing Yun. From her title, it's clear that she has a unique mastery over magic. It won't be easy for us to win! However, you shouldn't be weaker than her in magic variations. Even if I can't do it, there's still you.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"I'll do my best. Brother, didn't you say we were going to drink porridge? Let's go.\"\n\nThe two returned to the inn, picked up Feng Nü, and, led by Rong Bing, walked towards the south of the city.\n\nNian Bing naturally held Feng Nü's hand. Whenever he was with Feng Nü, his expression would become exceptionally gentle. Feng Nü's moist little hand was very warm, much warmer than his own. Holding it felt like holding warm jade, constantly warming Nian Bing's hand, and at the same time, warming his heart.\n\nEarlier, when Feng Nü heard Rong Bing was taking them to eat, she immediately grew very excited. Although she and Nian Bing often wandered around the city these days, they were still unfamiliar with the Hua Rong Empire. Having grown accustomed to Nian Bing's cooking, few things could now pique Feng Nü's interest. Her left hand was naturally held by Nian Bing. Her right hand clutched her Sky-Severing Divine Sword, which never left her side. Bathed in sunlight, Feng Nü thought to herself, how wonderful it would be if she could be with Nian Bing like this every day!\n\n\"Brother, what's special about the porridge we're having today? Tell us about it,\" Nian Bing said, smiling at Rong Bing.\n\nRong Bing glanced at Nian Bing and Feng Nü holding hands, feeling a surge of comfort in his heart. \"Not only is the porridge good at this restaurant today, but they also have a signature dish that's even more delicious. Oh, right, Nian Bing. Dad told me to tell you that after this competition ends, he wants me to take you to see him. He said he's afraid of affecting your final sprint of cultivation these past few days, so he'll hold off on seeing you for now.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart immediately warmed when Rong Bing mentioned his uncle. His uncle and father were twins! Seeing his uncle would be like seeing his own father. As he thought of his father, an intense hatred couldn't help but flash in Nian Bing's eyes.\n\nRong Bing saw Nian Bing's gaze and naturally knew what he was thinking of. He quickly said, \"Guess what this restaurant's specialty is, besides porridge, that I'm taking you to today?\"\n\nFeng Nü tightened her grip on Nian Bing's hand and said, \"Is it steamed buns? Steamed buns and porridge are usually sold together.\" Although she was guessing, her gaze was fixed on Nian Bing with concern. If Rong Bing could tell something was wrong with Nian Bing, how could she not?\n\nNian Bing felt Feng Nü's concern and smiled slightly, \"I'm fine, I just thought of Father. Brother, was her guess correct?\"\n\nRong Bing patted Nian Bing's shoulder and said, \"Of course not. If it were just steamed buns, I wouldn't have made you guess. I'll tell you, their specialty is flatbread wraps with hairtail fish. And it's quite expensive.\"\n\nOriginally, Nian Bing still had a few traces of sadness in his heart, but as soon as he heard about the flatbread wraps with hairtail fish, his eyes immediately lit up. He was most interested in delicacies he hadn't heard of before.\n\nFeng Nü asked, \"Big Brother, what are flatbread wraps with hairtail fish? All fish have bones, is this hairtail fish boneless then? Otherwise, how can you wrap it?\"\n\nRong Bing smiled slightly, \"There are bones, of course. However, their cooking method is extremely special. Although it has bones, it's also boneless in a way. You'll know once we get there and you taste it.\"\n\n\"Move aside! Move aside!\" A somewhat frantic voice accompanied by an ear-piercing grinding sound rang out. Before Nian Bing could react, Feng Nü had already pulled him aside. With her other hand, Feng Nü simultaneously pulled Rong Bing. Just as they dodged, a luxurious carriage sped past like lightning. Instantly, it caused pandemonium on the main road, and cries of alarm kept coming.\n\nThe carriage was pulled by four splendid horses. Its body was dark green, with extremely luxurious decorations. All the edges of the carriage were inlaid with gold, and the carriage curtains were also gold. Although the carriage was very fast, its body appeared very stable, clearly a high-class carriage.\n\nHaving nearly been hit, a cold glint flashed in Rong Bing's eyes. He said indifferently, \"I've never seen anyone dare to be so arrogant in Dutian City.\" As soon as he spoke, he casually threw out a Fireball spell, sending it after the carriage. As the prodigy of the Rong family's third generation since childhood, Rong Bing and Nian Bing had very different perspectives on certain things. It was absolutely not Rong Bing's style to not retaliate when offended. In Dutian City, he didn't need to consider anything much; even members of the royal family couldn't do anything to him.\n\nJust as the Fireball spell was about to collide with the carriage, a faint green glow suddenly appeared behind the carriage. With a muffled sound, the Fireball spell quietly extinguished within the faint green light, without even a single spark. Rong Bing's heart stirred. He knew that although it was an ordinary Fireball spell, he had rapidly compressed it when casting, giving it extremely powerful explosive force. Yet, it was neutralized so easily, and what the opponent used was clearly not battle qi. Green light? What kind of magic was that?\n\nThe carriage stopped after galloping for several tens of meters. The coachman jumped down from the carriage. He was a burly strong man, with bulging muscles on his face forming lines, and fierce light glinting in his eyes. He walked a few steps to the back of the carriage, looking out at the street, and roared loudly, \"Who was that blind fool just now?!\"\n\nRong Bing slowly walked out, saying indifferently, \"Your grandpa.\"\n\nThe strong man was stunned for a moment. \"My grandpa? My grandpa isn't here!\"\n\nRong Bing said coldly, \"Isn't your grandpa standing right here? Having a grandson like you is truly disgraceful.\" His words immediately caused the surrounding onlookers to burst into laughter.\n\nOnly then did the strong man realize the other person was insulting him. He immediately roared, \"You're making a fool of me!\" He took a step forward, instantly appearing before Rong Bing, and his massive fist suddenly slammed towards Rong Bing's body.\n\nA hint of coldness flashed in Rong Bing's eyes. He didn't move. A faint red glow emanated from his body. Although the strong man's speed surprised him, having undergone countless real combat trainings under Prince Rong, he still didn't consider this strong man a threat. Just as the strong man's fist was about to reach him, blazing flames instantly surged up. The flames did not spread out but condensed together, forming a massive shield that blocked Rong Bing.\n\nWith a bang, the strong man's fist struck the fire shield. Fierce flames instantly swept towards the direction of the attack. The strong man roared, his body retreating faster than he came, but several places on him were still burned by the flames, leaving him charred black all over. Rong Bing extended his right hand, and red flames emerged from his palm. The color of the flames gradually changed, turning from red to blue amidst his low incantation. He had no reservations; attacked in the street, with his status, even killing would be no big deal.\n\nThe strong man emanated a layer of yellow battle qi. In his rage, he pulled out a broad axe from behind him. With battle qi permeating his entire body, just as he was about to charge forward, a voice suddenly rang out, \"Stop, A Si, you're too presumptuous!\"\n\nTwo people descended from the carriage, one male and one female. Both were wearing green magic robes, with no insignia indicating their rank. The man had an ordinary appearance but exuded an aristocratic demeanor. The woman was extremely beautiful, appearing to be around twenty years old. Her long, emerald green hair cascaded to her waist, and a curious expression showed in her dark green eyes as she stared at Rong Bing. She held a small magic staff in her hand. It was the man who spoke. Both walked forward simultaneously, the man with a slight smile on his face.\n\nAs soon as the coachman saw the man and woman, he quickly bowed respectfully. \"Young Master, Miss.\"\n\nThe man walked up to Rong Bing, his gaze pausing for a moment on the Golden Lion on Rong Bing's chest. His expression unchanged, he said, \"I'm truly sorry, my subordinate was presumptuous. I am Mu Rong, and this is my younger sister, Mu Jing.\"\n\nRong Bing coldly looked at Mu Rong before him and said indifferently, \"Those with the surname Mu are exceedingly rare. Your Excellency must be from the Langmu Empire, I presume? Wood-element magic, mutated from Earth-element magic, seems to be something only the Langmu Empire's royal family possesses. I wonder if I'm mistaken.\"",

    "content": "A flicker of surprise passed through Mu Rong's eyes. Mu Jing looked at Rong Bing with a touch more approval, seemingly quite interested in the handsome young man before her. Mu Rong calmly said, \"Indeed, my sister and I are from the Lang Mu Empire. Seeing the mark on your chest, you must be from the Rong family, right?\"\n\nNian Bing and Feng Nü had now arrived in front of Rong Bing. Upon seeing Feng Nü, Mu Jing's emerald eyes couldn't help but reveal a hint of jealousy, while Mu Rong's eyes lit up even more.\n\nRong Bing coldly said, \"This is Dutian City, the capital of my Hua Rong Empire. Your carriage is rampaging through Dutian City like this; do you disdain the Hua Rong Empire, thinking there's no one here?\"\n\nMu Rong smiled slightly, \"We are truly sorry, we were just in a hurry. If we were any later, we were afraid we'd miss the registration.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred, and he said, \"So, you're here to represent the Lang Mu Empire in this year's Rising Star Magician Competition?\"\n\nMu Jing said, \"That's right, my brother and I are here for the competition. Since you are from the Rong family, are you also competitors?\"\n\nRong Bing calmly said, \"We will meet on the competition grounds. However, before that, if your carriage continues as before, I'm afraid you won't need to participate in the competition.\"\n\nMu Jing said with slight anger, \"We represent the Lang Mu Empire; speak more politely.\"\n\nRong Bing would not be swayed by her beauty, \"I have been very polite. Otherwise, it wouldn't have just been a Fireball Spell earlier.\"\n\n\"Presumptuous! What are you, daring to speak to our young master like that?\" A Si, who had retreated to the side earlier, charged forward.\n\nRong Bing didn't even glance at him, and calmly said to Mu Rong, \"Your dog is barking wildly.\"\n\nBefore Mu Rong could speak, A Si let out a wild roar, his entire body erupting with Battle Qi, and his battle axe abruptly chopped towards Rong Bing. This time, it was Nian Bing who acted. With a flick of his right hand, red and blue lights simultaneously floated out. They condensed in mid-air into a fist-sized orb of light that met A Si's battle axe. Rong Bing had no reservations; now, Nian Bing had even fewer. Every time Nian Bing made a move to kill, the coldness in his heart would spread out.\n\nBoom----. A Si's body was sent flying backward by the shock. He spat out mouthfuls of blood, falling heavily three *zhang*<sup>1</sup> away.\n\nThe Ice-Fire Co-Source Magic Orb was no longer what it used to be. After Nian Bing's improvements, although it was a momentary small magic, it had been rapidly compressed. He had prepared it when Rong Bing first confronted A Si, continuously compressing it in his hand, and now conveniently used it. However, Nian Bing was still surprised. He had originally thought that the magic orb's explosion would surely shatter the opponent's Battle Qi and blast him to smithereens, but A Si's Battle Qi was stronger than he had imagined. Although he was only at the advanced Swordsman level, his earth-attribute Battle Qi dissolved most of the explosive force in the instant it shattered. This was how he managed to save his life.\n\nNian Bing acted quickly; no one except Feng Nü saw what magic he used. A cold glint flashed in Mu Rong's eyes, and a strong green light emanated from his body, saying, \"When beating a dog, one must also look at its master<sup>2</sup>. Are you ignoring my presence?\"\n\nNian Bing snorted coldly. He looked at Mu Rong somewhat provocatively, as if saying, \"What if I am ignoring you?\"\n\nMu Rong extended his right hand forward, lightly patting towards Nian Bing's chest, but it was Rong Bing who met him. Their hands met. Red and green lights instantly expanded. This was a relatively peaceful method of contest among magicians, where both sides used a palm to compete purely with magical power. After all, they were in the Hua Rong Empire, and Mu Rong dared not go too far.\n\nThe surrounding magical aura instantly intensified. Mu Rong's expression changed, and he staggered back three steps before regaining his footing. He had been pushed back by Rong Bing's magical power. He nodded forcefully, \"Good, I've learned my lesson. We'll see you on the competition stage.\" After speaking, he turned and left with his sister. A Si struggled to his feet from the ground, glared resentfully at Nian Bing, and followed them away.\n\nWatching the carriage slowly depart, Feng Nü softly said, \"Nian Bing, you were too heavy-handed, weren't you?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"Who told him to offend my brother?\" Seeing Rong Bing's questioning gaze, he explained, \"Although my magic orb didn't directly finish off that servant, the ice and fire energies have already surged into his meridians. Under the effect of two extreme energies, he won't live past tonight; he's just holding on for now. Brother, are they from the Lang Mu Empire's royal family?\"\n\nRong Bing was secretly shocked. He had always thought he was ruthless enough, but he never expected that the seemingly gentle Nian Bing, once he acted, would be even more overbearing than himself, leaving no room for the opponent. Although he thought this, he didn't voice it, \"That's right, they are from the Lang Mu Empire's royal family. The wood-element magic of the Lang Mu Empire is a very unique type of magic; when used, it can borrow the power of nature, which is very distinctive. Unfortunately, fire restrains wood, so although they are strong, they are always suppressed by our Hua Rong Empire. Nian Bing, if you encounter this brother and sister pair, try to use fire-element magic as your main attack. Mu Rong is a Great Magician in terms of strength; although his magical power isn't particularly strong, you must be careful of the peculiarities of wood-element magic.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"I understand, Brother. Let's go eat. I'm really looking forward to tasting that Pancake-Wrapped Ribbonfish.\"\n\nThe previous incident did not affect their mood. After walking through a few streets, they arrived at their destination. The restaurant's name was 'Pancake-Wrapped Ribbonfish', and its sign was quite large. Although it had only one floor, the main hall was extremely spacious. The three found a window-side table and sat down. Rong Bing handed the menu to Nian Bing and said to the waiter, \"First, bring us three servings of Pancake-Wrapped Ribbonfish. Nian Bing, take a look and see what kind of congee you'd like to drink.\"\n\nNian Bing held the menu in his hand and was surprised to find that it only listed names. At the top was 'First-Grade Congee', followed by dozens of congee names like 'Black Sesame Glutinous Rice Congee', 'Emerald Pork Liver Congee', 'Barley Jujube Yam Congee', 'Lotus Leaf Ice Congee', 'Fruit Ice Congee', 'Mung Bean Ice Congee', and so on. Just from the names of the congees, Nian Bing already understood a lot. This restaurant had a similar characteristic to the congee pot shop Rong Bing had taken him to before: the nutritional combinations of these congees had clearly been guided by an expert; each combination was extremely ingenious, and their nourishing effects were very evident.\n\nRong Bing smiled slightly, \"How is it? Not bad, right? I suggest you try those few ice congees; they taste excellent.\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment and said, \"Then let's each have two bowls of congee. We'll take First-Grade Congee, Emerald Pork Liver Congee, Barley Jujube Yam Congee, Lotus Leaf Ice Congee, Fruit Ice Congee, and Mung Bean Ice Congee. I want to try each type and see what's special about them.\"\n\nSoon, their ordered food was brought to them. Three plates of pancakes were cut into rectangles, steaming hot. They were clearly fresh out of the pan. The ribbonfish, from the surface, seemed to have no special characteristics. Underneath the three full plates of ribbonfish, pickled vegetables served as a base. The congees were clearly pre-cooked, and the six bowls of congee were each of a different color. First-Grade Congee was actually glutinous rice congee. However, crushed walnuts, peanuts, and white sesame were added to the congee, making it look incredibly appetizing.\n\nRong Bing was the first to act, picking up a piece of pancake onto his plate, then adding two pieces of ribbonfish. After rolling it up with the pancake, he put it into his mouth and began chewing, \"Nian Bing, sister-in-law, try it, the taste is excellent.\"\n\nNian Bing and Feng Nü followed Rong Bing's lead. The pancakes were perfectly cooked, distinct in layers, crispy and fragrant upon biting. The ribbonfish looked stewed on the surface, but upon tasting, it wasn't delicate like tender fish meat; instead, it had a rich aroma. What was peculiar was that the ribbonfish bones were completely crispy and could be eaten whole. The pairing of pancake and ribbonfish moved even a top chef like Nian Bing.\n\n\"The taste is truly excellent. The pancakes are perfectly cooked; only an experienced pastry chef could make them. This ribbonfish must have been prepared by stewing, but if the time is too long, the fish meat would fall apart, yet the ribbonfish here is very firm. Let me think, ah, right, it must have been stewed under high pressure with intense heat. But where would this pressure come from? And this aroma is so unique.\"\n\nRong Bing smiled slightly, \"Nian Bing, it seems your culinary skills are quite good; you can discern the secrets just by eating. It was indeed stewed. As for the high pressure, it's artificially created. I specifically asked the chef here. When stewing the ribbonfish, they use an extra-thick iron pot, one inch thick, and the lid is even two inches thick, with no holes. This way, the heat is difficult to dissipate, and cooking over high heat produces this flavor. As for the aroma you mentioned, try the pickled vegetables beneath the ribbonfish.\"\n\nHearing Rong Bing's explanation and looking at the somewhat translucent pickled vegetable strips, Nian Bing immediately understood, \"Using pickled vegetables as a base, then adding seasonings and stewing it—what a great method! The chef here has truly unique ideas. Pancake-Wrapped Ribbonfish is both novel and delicious. Excellent!\"\n\nThe meal concluded in a relaxed atmosphere. Both the ribbonfish and the various congees left a deep impression on Nian Bing. Connecting it to his own culinary skills, it provided him with considerable inspiration. Among the many congees, what Nian Bing appreciated the most was the Fruit Ice Congee. The fruits inside were simple, only three kinds: watermelon, pear, and banana. All three fruits were cut into small cubes, using glutinous rice congee as a base. The taste was cool, sweet, and fragrant, deeply beloved by Feng Nü, who then pressured Nian Bing to make it for her in the future.\n\nTwo days passed quickly. Since only competitors could participate in the competition, Nian Bing had Feng Nü stay at the inn to wait for him. After a month together, although they maintained proper etiquette, their hearts had long since drawn closer. Just as Rong Bing had said, the Phoenix clan had not yet appeared. Regardless of how this competition turned out, Nian Bing would tell Feng Nü his conjectures about her background after it concluded. When he was about to leave, Feng Nü showed no signs of worry. She understood that Nian Bing now needed her support. She only said one thing to Nian Bing: \"I believe in your strength.\"\n\nThe Imperial Palace gates were already in sight. Perhaps because the Rising Star Magician Competition was to be held here today, the palace guards had become even more stringent. Nian Bing arrived very early. After presenting his competition token, he was led into the Imperial Palace by a soldier.\n\nFrom childhood to adulthood, this was Nian Bing's first time entering a nation's Imperial Palace, and it was that of the Hua Rong Empire, reputed to be the strongest nation on the continent. There wasn't much ornamentation in the Imperial Palace; even plants were rarely seen. However, every palace exuded an aura of solemnity. The magnificent palaces were not overly ornate, but they gave an exceptionally sturdy impression. The Hua Rong Empire was a nation that revered fire, so the place where the Hua Tian Emperor summoned his officials was called the Fire God Hall.\n\nThe Fire God Hall was the tallest building in the entire Imperial Palace, yet it had only one floor. However, the height of this single floor exceeded fifteen *zhang*. Inside the Fire God Hall, it was extremely spacious. The central aisle, leading directly to the Hua Tian Emperor's Dragon Throne at the very back, was twenty *zhang* wide, covered with a red carpet. The Hua Rong Empire's officials stood divided on either side. At the very front of the officials, near the Hua Tian Emperor, large chairs were placed on both sides. Seated on the right chair was none other than Prince Rong Yan, known as the 'Flame Lion King,' and opposite him, naturally, was the Empire's Chancellor, Su Yue, who was also a founding elder.\n\nNian Bing was very familiar with Prince Rong Yan. At this time, the Hua Tian Emperor had not yet arrived. He immediately spotted Su Yue, who was opposite Prince Rong Yan. Su Yue appeared much younger than Prince Rong Yan; although both were elders, Su Yue exuded an air of scholarly elegance. He was not wearing official robes; his moon-white long robe added to his refined scholarly demeanor. His figure was well-proportioned, his facial features soft, and his phoenix eyes also revealed a gentle radiance. Compared to Prince Rong Yan's overt sharpness, he seemed easier to approach.\n\nNian Bing was led by a soldier to stand among the officials. Next to him was Rong Bing. Due to the need to avoid suspicion, Rong Bing did not greet him; the two appeared as if they didn't know each other. Nian Bing's gaze shifted, and he noticed that among the ten competitors, besides himself and his brother, another person had arrived. He stood on Rong Bing's other side, his face expressionless, and a golden lion emblem on his left chest—it was Rong Ji, the Hua Rong Empire's other participant.\n\nUpon seeing Rong Ji again, Nian Bing suddenly had a strange feeling. Rong Ji seemed different from before; he had become more introverted, not even emitting a trace of magical fluctuation. However, Nian Bing subtly felt that Rong Ji's strength was likely not only not inferior to Rong Bing's but perhaps even surpassed it.\n\nAlthough both the Rong family and the Su family were pillars of the Hua Rong Empire, there was an unwritten rule: unless there was an important matter, only the patriarchs of the two families could attend the Hua Tian Emperor's court assembly. Therefore, Nian Bing did not see his longed-for uncle, Rong Yue, here.\n\nPrince Rong Yan's gaze was lowered. Rong Bing and Nian Bing entering the hall did not seem to catch his attention. Instead, Chancellor Su Yue subtly nodded to Rong Bing before fixing his gaze on Nian Bing. Although Nian Bing had altered his appearance, his handsome looks and extraordinary demeanor still caught Su Yue's attention.\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> *zhang*: An ancient Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or 10.9 feet.\n<sup>2</sup> *When beating a dog, one must also look at its master*: This idiom implies that harming a subordinate is an affront to their superior or master.",

    "content": "Nian Bing had specially donned a red magician's robe today. It naturally bore no emblem, nor any sign of his magician rank. His transformed black hair naturally fell to his shoulders, and his expression was calm.\n\nSu Yue revealed a faint smile to Nian Bing. His gaze was very gentle, yet surprisingly possessed a strange penetrative power, as if it could peer into one's very soul. Sensing Su Yue's gaze, Nian Bing's mental energy naturally condensed, forming a natural resistance.\n\nBefore long, the magicians participating in the competition arrived one after another. After the Nian Bing and Rong Bing brothers, it was Mu Rong and Mu Jing from the Langmu Empire who arrived. The two stood opposite the Nian Bing brothers. Mu Jing's gaze was very lively; when her eyes fell upon the Rong Bing brothers, a hint of anger and provocation, filled with deep hatred, was revealed. Mu Rong was clearly much more mature than his sister, his gaze cold and devoid of any emotional color.\n\nSubsequently, two young magicians from the Qiru Empire arrived. Both of them looked ordinary in appearance. From their magician's robes, it could be seen that they were a Wind-attribute and a Water-attribute magician respectively. Their ordinary appearance did not make Nian Bing underestimate them; how could those representing their nations be weak?\n\nAfter them came the people sent by the Aolan Empire's Magician's Guild. Surprisingly, two women arrived. What surprised Nian Bing was that the attributes of these two female magicians were extremely rare; they were dressed respectively in silver magician's robes symbolizing Spatial-attribute and golden magician's robes symbolizing Light-attribute. Coupled with their beautiful appearance, they immediately became the most eye-catching among the competing magicians. Although the two female magicians tried their best to restrain themselves, when their gazes swept across the ministers present, they couldn't help but subconsciously reveal a hateful aura. After all, facing the enemies who had once invaded their country, how could their hearts remain calm?\n\nAlthough these magicians each had their unique characteristics, they were not the ones Nian Bing most wanted to see. At this moment, the hatred hidden within his heart was gradually burning. He waited quietly, waiting for the appearance of the last participant.\n\nQianhuan Bingyun finally arrived. Unaccompanied, she quietly walked into the Fire God Temple. The moment she stepped into the Fire God Temple, the temperature of the entire temple seemed to drop with her. That was not due to magic, but rather the chill she inherently carried.\n\nFinally seeing the enemy they were about to face, both Nian Bing and Rong Bing's bodies involuntarily tensed. Even Rong Ji, who had a calm expression beside them, twitched slightly.\n\nQianhuan Bingyun's steps were slow. She walked directly to a spot below and stopped. Her pure white magician's robe was embroidered with blue ice flowers. Her slender figure was in no way inferior to Fenghua's. A waterfall of blue hair cascaded down to the ground. However, near the ground, something seemed to support it, making it slightly curl up behind her. No one could clearly see her face, as she wore a layer of white veil. Yet, her ancient, unruffled blue eyes were filled with chill, as if she herself was a block of ice, an eternal ice block.\n\nA perfect figure, an icy demeanor, coupled with calm and incomparably deep eyes. These constituted everything about this young magician from the Ice God Tower. Her appearance overshadowed the radiance of the other three female magicians, like an untainted ice flower blooming in the cold.\n\nPrince Rong slowly raised his head, his cold, lightning-like gaze sweeping over Qianhuan Bingyun. Bingyun's calm eyes showed no change, but her slender body trembled slightly, taking a step back to stand perfectly at the very end of Nian Bing's side of the magicians.\n\nA sigh of emotion flashed across Prince Rong. He then resumed his previous appearance, as if nothing had happened. Just then, the herald on the dais loudly proclaimed, \"His Majesty has arrived!\"\n\nEveryone's gaze turned towards the throne in the Fire God Temple. Surrounded by palace maids, the eighty-year-old Huatian the Great slowly ascended his throne. With him came someone Nian Bing was very familiar with: Princess Huayi Nuo. Nuo had changed into formal attire today; her pink princess dress accentuated her noble temperament, making her even more beautiful. Nuo supported her grandfather's hand, and from the moment she appeared, there was only one person in her eyes.\n\nRong Bing's gaze met the ardent light in Nuo's eyes. He nodded slightly at her, revealing a rare smile.\n\nWhile Rong Bing and Nuo were exchanging glances, Nian Bing meticulously observed Huatian the Great, who had founded the great Huarong Empire. Although Huatian the Great also had white hair and beard, he certainly did not look like an old man on his last legs. His rosy skin was very lustrous, and wrinkles were rarely seen. Though stern with a faint smile, he naturally exuded an invisible majesty. If not for his beard revealing his age, at a glance, he would only appear to be around forty. None of the three who founded the Huarong Empire were simple individuals: Prince Rong was a powerful Fire-attribute magician, Prime Minister Su Yue was known as the Yangguang Continent's foremost strategist, and Huatian the Great himself had reached the Martial Saint realm at the age of forty. Having been emperor for many years, it had been a long time since anyone had seen him make a move, yet no one doubted that he was a top-tier warrior. Back then, it was this smiling emperor who, alongside Prince Rong, slayed countless enemies. Huatian the Great was known as the Iron-Blooded Emperor.\n\nExcept for Rong Yan and Su Yue, all the officials simultaneously knelt on the ground, respectfully proclaiming, \"Long live, long live, long long live!\" The foreign magicians also knelt on one knee, performing a half-bow. Only Qianhuan Bingyun remained standing, like an aloof ice lotus, still exuding that faint chill.\n\n\"Bold! Why do you not pay your respects, outsider?\"\n\nQianhuan Bingyun said calmly, \"I serve a god, not a human.\" This simple sentence already declared her stance. Although her clear, cold voice was pleasant to the ear, it made those with an appreciation for beauty secretly sweat for her.\n\nPrince Rong's gaze fell on Qianhuan Bingyun twice. This time, he slowly stood up. Huatian was not only the emperor, but also his brother; he would not allow anyone to disrespect his brother.\n\nHuatian the Great smiled slightly and said, \"Old Rong, you're already so old, don't get so agitated. Sit down.\"\n\nPrince Rong's gaze met Huatian's. Huatian nodded slightly at him. Prince Rong immediately understood his old brother's meaning, his gaze sweeping instantly over the Rong Bing and Rong Ji brothers. Huatian the Great's meaning was clear: relying on the advantage of their home territory to make opponents submit would go against the original intention of the Five Nations Magician Competition; only defeating opponents in the competition itself was the act of true powerhouses. The burden on Rong Bing and Rong Ji became even heavier.\n\n\"People from the Ice God Tower are indeed unique. I heard that your name should be Bingyun, miss?\" Huatian the Great seemed most interested in the Ice God Tower.\n\nQianhuan Bingyun said calmly, \"Yes.\"\n\nHuatian the Great's gaze swept over the other competing magicians and said, \"Then who is the other person representing the Ice Moon Empire?\"\n\nQianhuan Bingyun said, \"I don't know. I came alone. The Ice God Tower has no connection whatsoever with the Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild.\" Although her tone did not change, it sounded so harsh to Nian Bing's ears.\n\nStepping out of the line, Nian Bing turned to Huatian the Great and said, \"I am Nian Bing, representing the Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild to participate in this competition. Just as Miss Bingyun said, our Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild has no relation whatsoever with the Ice God Tower, and I also came here alone.\" There was nothing wrong with his words, but he deliberately emphasized certain syllables, and his speech was filled with disdain, as if the Ice God Tower was a rat on the street that one would avoid at all costs.\n\nHuatian the Great smiled slightly and said, \"So that's how it is. I didn't expect the Ice Moon Empire to send a Fire-attribute magician to compete.\"\n\nNian Bing looked directly at Huatian the Great. \"I am not a Fire-attribute magician.\"\n\nHuatian the Great said with some surprise, \"Then why are you wearing a Fire-attribute magician's robe?\"\n\nNian Bing gave a cold smile and said, \"Because there isn't a magician's robe suitable for me yet. I'm just wearing whatever.\" Only Prince Rong and Rong Bing could truly appreciate the meaning behind his words.\n\nHuatian the Great smiled, \"Interesting. In that case, I shall await your splendid performances. Today, the Five Nations Rising Star Magician Competition is about to begin again. The names of the participants are already known, so I won't say much else. As with previous years, only the final champion will receive a prize. Although my Huarong Empire cannot be described as wealthy, we will certainly not be stingy with the prizes. Prince Rong, you told me the day before yesterday that the prize was ready. Please bring it out to motivate our competitors.\" Huatian the Great's words gave off a relaxed feeling; he had no imperial airs.\n\nPrince Rong rose again, extending both hands. A red light flashed in his hands. Instantly, a long, rectangular brocade box appeared. The red light shimmered in his hands, and the seal affixed to the brocade box slowly opened. Immediately, a soft yellow light drifted out. The light was not at all dazzling; the gentle halo was filled with the aura of life. Everyone saw that inside the brocade box was a saber—a plain-looking, unadorned thick-backed saber. The saber, including its hilt, was about two feet long; the hilt was eight inches long, and the blade was one foot two inches long. The back of the blade was extremely thick, a full two inches. Just by looking at it, one could feel the saber's weight. What most attracted the competing magicians was the irregularly faceted gem on the hilt; the faint yellow halo emanated from that very gem.\n\nHuatian the Great's eyes showed a hint of surprise. \"Originally, for this competition, I planned to bring out one of my collected treasures, but Prince Rong insisted on replacing it for me. Old Rong, I didn't expect you to go to such expense! This Longevity Saber seems to be the one we found back when we were in...\"\n\nPrince Rong said, \"Precisely. It is indeed that Longevity Saber. The blade of this saber is forged from the Essence of Earth Rock, and the Longevity Stone on its hilt is the supreme treasure among Earth-attribute magic stones. Most precious is the aura of life imbued within this saber. This saber is priceless; whether one can obtain it will depend on the abilities of the magicians from each nation. Not only is it a top-tier treasured saber, but it can also be fully utilized as a magic staff. Its title is 'Melody of Earth's Awakening'.\"\n\nFinishing his last word, Prince Rong's gaze fell upon Nian Bing. Nian Bing's entire body trembled. Although Prince Rong's gaze only swept past him quickly, he still sensed a hint of expectation in Prince Rong's eyes. It seemed to say, \"Whether you can obtain this treasured saber depends on yourself.\" Did he propose this prize for him? Yes, he knew that his Mimicry Magic lacked only an Earth-attribute magic saber. But why would he do this? Was he still the Prince Rong he knew? Nian Bing's heart became somewhat muddled. The intense hatred that had arisen from Qianhuan Bingyun's appearance grew even more complex after the Longevity Saber appeared. He clearly understood the significance of this Longevity Saber to him. Galamandis had once told him that if he could complete all his Mimicry Magic, its application would surely see a breakthrough due to the mutual generation of the various magical attributes. As for what realm he could reach, that was hard to say. The allure of being an all-attribute magician was too great for Nian Bing, but he truly did not want to owe Prince Rong a favor. Did Prince Rong simply assume he could win?\n\nPrince Rong closed the brocade box and handed it to a guard on the dais, then nodded to Huatian the Great. Huatian the Great smiled slightly and said, \"Good, you have seen the prize. Deny that it is for honor and not for this valuable reward, and strive hard. Alright, now we will begin the drawing of lots. If magicians from the same country draw the same group, please have one of them redraw.\"\n\nTwo other people were equally attracted to the Longevity Saber as Nian Bing: the Mu Rong siblings. Nature Magic is based on Earth-attribute magic, and the Longevity Saber, filled with life aura, held extraordinary significance for them. The siblings' eyes lit up simultaneously, and firm conviction flowed within their gazes. The image of the Longevity Saber was deeply imprinted in their hearts. The Melody of Earth's Awakening—what a scene it would be if they could cast Nature Magic with it?\n\nAlthough others did not show it as obviously as the Mu Rong siblings, their hearts all grew fervent when faced with a top-grade magic saber and the highest honor for young magicians. Only one person remained perfectly calm: Qianhuan Bingyun's gaze was still as icy, as if none of this concerned her.",

    "content": "A Palace Official, carrying an ordinary wooden tube, approached the competing mages. No one moved. Everyone knew that the first match of the competition was extremely important. According to the rules, the two groups of the Group Stage would each have two matches every day, with one person getting a bye. After the Group Stage, there would be a two-day rest, followed by the final rounds, which consisted of three matches in total: two on the first day, then a one-day rest, and finally the battle for the championship. Therefore, if one could encounter a relatively weaker opponent in the early stages of the competition, they could better conserve their magic power and maintain their condition, and also get ample rest after the Group Stage. There wasn't a single mage participating in this competition who didn't aspire to win the final championship.\n\nNian Bing was the first to step forward. He had no illusions about the opponent he would face; for him, it didn't matter what happened, as he couldn't possibly encounter Qian Huanbing Yun in the Group Stage anyway. He casually drew a lot and returned to his position. After Nian Bing drew, the other mages followed suit. The drawing of lots was surprisingly smooth; there were no situations where mages from the same country were in the same group.\n\nNian Bing held Lot One of Group Two. In the upcoming first round of matches, he would face Lot Two of the same group. Rong Bing had, as he wished, drawn into Group One, with Qian Huanbing Yun in his group. Furthermore, having drawn Lots Three and Four respectively, they would clash in the second match of Group One today.\n\nThe Wind Elemental Mage from the Kiru Empire smiled as he looked at the lot in his hand. This was definitely an excellent lot: Group Two, Lot Two. He was about to face the representative from the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild, who had never made it into the top eight. He was full of confidence about the outcome of this first match. But was it truly an excellent lot?\n\nLed by a Palace Official from the Hua Rong Empire's Fire God Temple, ten mages representing five nations left the Fire God Temple. The Palace was vast. They were led to a great hall behind the Palace, one no less impressive than the Fire God Temple itself. Before entering the hall, everyone clearly saw three gilded characters hanging on a plaque outside: Trial Hall.\n\nAlthough this hall was vast, its layout was very simple. In the center of the hall was a huge circular platform, ten feet high and over thirty feet in diameter. There were staircases on both sides leading up to the platform. The entire hall seemed to have been built around this platform, which stood sixty feet high. Upon entering the hall, one could clearly feel the rich magical aura suffusing this main Trial Hall. Upon closer inspection, one could discern the sealing power contained within the four walls of the hall.\n\nAs the ten competing mages observed their surroundings, a line of mages clad in red robes filed in. Their formation was exceptionally neat. Upon entering the hall, they immediately formed a circle around the platform. A total of one hundred Fire Elemental Mages formed this circle, and they all shared a common characteristic: an insignia of a Grand Mage on their chests.\n\nNian Bing was secretly astonished. Indeed, it was worthy of being the continent's strongest nation. The Hua Rong Empire's mage lineup alone was far incomparable to that of the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild. One hundred Grand Mages! If used in war, what formidable strength that would be! These mages were clearly long-term comrades; if they coordinated well, the destructive power they could unleash would be unimaginable.\n\nThe last person to enter, following the one hundred Fire Elemental Mages, was someone Nian Bing knew: none other than Rong Fei, Prince Rong's third brother. The Archmage insignia shone brightly on his chest. He walked to the inner side of the hall, on the opposite side of the platform. There, seats were neatly arranged, with the central, spacious seat clearly reserved for Emperor Hua Tian.\n\nSoon after, Emperor Hua Tian, leading dozens of people including Prince Rong and Chancellor Su Yue, entered the Trial Hall from another side. At this point, the status of the Hua Rong Empire's officials became evident; all who were able to spectate the competition here were high-ranking officials of the Hua Rong Empire. After Emperor Hua Tian and the others had settled in their seats, Prince Rong nodded to Rong Fei.\n\nA red glow of flames enveloped Rong Fei's body and he rose into the air. Over seventy years old, he showed no sign of age. Lifted by the red flames, his body ascended gracefully onto the ten-foot diameter platform. He slowly walked to the center of the platform and, facing the ten competing mages below, Rong Fei smiled faintly: \"As you all can see, this circular platform will be your arena for the foreseeable future. I shall serve as the referee for this competition. Here, we have one hundred Grand Mages from our nation's Mage Corps guarding you. When casting your magic, you may unleash it freely, without any reservations. If you believe you are not an opponent's match, you may concede defeat. Any injuries sustained are your own responsibility. However, if one party continues to attack after the other concedes, they will be ruled as losing. Forward, Mages of Group One, Lot One and Lot Two, please ascend the platform. You may only act when I declare the match begins. Magic items may be used during the match, but magic scrolls are strictly forbidden.\"\n\nThe one who drew Lot One of Group One was Mu Rong from the Langmu Empire, while Lot Two of Group One was drawn by the Light Elemental female mage from the Oulan Empire. The two walked onto the arena platform, standing thirty feet apart, facing each other. Mu Rong appeared very graceful. He smiled faintly at the Light Elemental female mage opposite him and politely said, \"I am Mu Rong from the Langmu Empire. Please enlighten me.\" His true targets were actually Rong Bing and Nian Bing. His subordinate named Ah Si had followed him for many years, but after returning that day, he had not lasted long before dying. After being crippled, Ah Si's meridians were astonishingly half-burned and half-frozen. This filled Mu Rong with vigilance towards Nian Bing, and also with deep hostility. Only recently did he learn that Nian Bing actually represented the Ice Moon Empire, and specifically the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild. He was deeply convinced that with his own strength, he could certainly avenge Ah Si. Although he showed nothing on the surface, the hatred in his heart was deeply rooted.\n\nThe Light Elemental female mage seemed to bear no ill will towards the Langmu Empire. She returned the smile and greeting, \"My name is Fei Fei.\"\n\nRong Fei, standing at the center of the platform, looked at both of them and smiled faintly: \"Prepare, both of you.\" His words simultaneously served as an order to the one hundred Fire Elemental Grand Mages below the stage.\n\nA low, uniform chanting sound emanated from around the platform. The fire elements in the air instantly became exceptionally active. One hundred Fire Elemental Grand Mages using the same spell simultaneously produced a power that even a Fire Elemental Archmage could not rival. A red halo gracefully rose like a slow-moving cloth. A transparent red barrier enveloped the entire platform. Nian Bing, familiar with Fire Elemental magic, immediately recognized it: this was the Fire Elemental fifth-tier spell, Fire Cloud Barrier. Though only a fifth-tier spell, its power when cast by one hundred people simultaneously was extremely strong, capable of defending against any magic attack below a forbidden spell.\n\nRong Fei gracefully retreated to one side of the platform. He did not leave the arena. Wrapped in red flames, he shouted loudly, \"Group One, Lot One versus Group One, Lot Two, let the match begin!\"\n\nAs the match began, chanting instantly erupted. Mu Rong and Fei Fei raised their hands almost simultaneously. In Mu Rong's hand appeared a peculiar-looking staff, seemingly composed of countless fine vines. The staff was ten feet long, with a dark green, fruit-shaped gem at its head. Though not radiant, as soon as the staff appeared, a layer of green aura instantly formed around Mu Rong's body.\n\nFei Fei's movements were not slow at all. Her small staff brought forth a burst of golden light. On either side of the staff were pure white, wing-shaped carvings, supporting a walnut-sized golden gem at the top. Without any pause, as soon as the staff appeared, she immediately waved it lightly forward. In a flash of golden light, a bolt of light shot like lightning towards Mu Rong opposite her. In a one-on-one duel between mages, affecting the opponent's chanting of high-level spells was most crucial.\n\nMu Rong seemed to have anticipated his opponent's action. He held his long-handled staff vertically in front of him, and a layer of green radiance instantly formed a light shield, blocking the light arrow's attack. A strange scene occurred: when the light arrow exploded on the light shield and turned into specks of golden light, the original green light actually grew stronger. Mu Rong's staff transformed; the entire staff strangely disintegrated, turning into strands of green silk that overwhelmingly coiled towards Fei Fei.\n\nFei Fei was clearly startled by the scene before her. Retreating, she rapidly chanted a spell. Golden light rotated around her body, and a transparent golden barrier appeared amidst the spell, firmly blocking the encircling vine-like green threads. However, it merely blocked them. The green threads showed no change upon encountering the golden light. During the continuous piercing, the golden barrier became precarious, seeming as if it could break at any moment.\n\nMu Rong smiled as he watched Fei Fei trapped within his attack. \"Don't try to resist. Light illuminates the earth, but it will only produce a synergistic effect with my Nature Magic. You have no chance. This staff of mine is called Vine Silk. It's an excellent offensive magic item to begin with. Even without a spell, the offensive power it can generate is equivalent to a fifth-tier spell.\"\n\nFei Fei's pretty face revealed a hint of coldness. She calmly said, \"Is that really so? Light can indeed bring growth to nature, but excessive light can likewise cause nature to be destroyed due to loss of moisture.\" After saying this, she raised the Staff of Angels in her hand again. While maintaining her protective light barrier, she rapidly chanted a spell. Circles of golden aura continuously floated out from around her body. Each layer of golden light provided support to the protective light barrier, and those green vine threads could not penetrate in the slightest.\n\nMu Rong's expression changed slightly. He knew that his opponent had found a way to deal with his staff. Daring not to delay, he raised his palms, facing each other from a distance in front of his chest. The dark green gem that had been at the top of his staff previously now appeared within his palm. The dark green gem, suspended in mid-air, began to emit a faint, ethereal glow.\n\n\"Oh, great God of Earth! You are the Mother of all living beings. Please allow me to guide the power of nature, to transform into eternal spring sweeping every corner, to cause the seeds of life to sprout, to cause the breath of life to blossom. Nature's aura moves with me, Nature's aura is one with life. Nature Domain!\"\n\nMu Rong's chanting speed was very slow. Before his spell was complete, Fei Fei across from him had already changed. Her long-accumulated light instantly exploded, sweeping out as golden flames.\n\n\"Holy Flame, destroy all evil incursions.\" At this moment, Fei Fei, clad in a golden magic robe, appeared so sacred. Golden light swirled around her, and golden flames instantly spread from around her body. The previously advancing vines, as soon as they touched the golden flames, instantly emitted faint wisps of green smoke and rapidly retreated towards Mu Rong.\n\nMu Rong seemed to know nothing. When the sixth-tier Light Elemental spell, Holy Flame, was still ten feet away from him, his spell was finally complete. He loosened his hands, and the dark green gem, which had been suspended in mid-air, gently landed. Strangely, the gem directly merged into the ground and disappeared.\n\nThe vine silk condensed into a green shield three feet in front of Mu Rong, barely resisting the Holy Flame's attack. Mu Rong's face appeared somewhat pale, but a hint of smugness showed in his green eyes. \"Seeds of life need the nourishment of light, Fei Fei. I'm sorry.\"\n\nFei Fei, who was fully controlling Holy Flame, couldn't help but pause her hands upon hearing Mu Rong's words. However, to be able to represent the Oulan Empire, she naturally had her own extraordinary abilities. The Holy Flame, under her mental control, instantly split into two streams, bypassing the vine shield in front and coiling towards Mu Rong.\n\nThe strangeness of Nature Magic finally revealed itself. The entire arena platform was suddenly filled with the aura of life. The Holy Flame's radiance rapidly diminished, and countless green branches emerged from beneath the platform, as if the arena had transformed into a jungle. The Holy Flame was swallowed by a sea of green. Before Fei Fei could react, her body was already entwined by circles of green branches. The aura of life did not bring her discomfort, but her body's mobility was restricted. The green branches continued to grow until they reached the Fire Cloud Barrier's boundary before stopping. At this point, both Mu Rong and Fei Fei were submerged in green. On the entire platform, only within a ten-foot radius around Rong Fei were there no green branches.\n\nMu Rong's voice emerged from the sea of green. \"Nature and life exist everywhere between heaven and earth. How can one win by going against the power of nature? Miss Fei Fei, you have lost.\"\n\nThe green aura gradually receded, and the branches re-entered the ground. The entire platform was as smooth as before, as if nothing had happened. Fei Fei looked at Mu Rong in front of her with a somewhat bewildered expression. As a representative of a nation, she represented the dignity of the Oulan Empire. Her gaze towards Mu Rong was complicated. Although defeated, she had not suffered any injury. Fei Fei could clearly feel that her magical strength should not be inferior to Mu Rong's. However, from the very beginning of facing this bizarre Nature Magic, she felt an awkwardness of having power but nowhere to use it, preventing her magic from truly unleashing its power. She sighed lightly, lowered her head, and reluctantly said, \"I've lost.\"",

    "content": "The Rattan Silk Staff had already returned to its original form. Mu Rong was very satisfied with his result. A good start was very important for the subsequent matches.\n\nRong Fei stepped forward and announced, \"First Group, first match, Lang Mu Empire's Mu Rong wins.\"\n\nThe Fire Cloud Barrier dissipated. The two contestants, both unharmed, slowly walked off the competition stage. Only, their moods were completely different.\n\nMu Rong walked off the stage, his Rattan Silk Staff pointing distantly at Rong Fei, as if to say, next, the one to fail would be him. If he were facing Rong Fei, whether for the country or for personal reasons, he would absolutely not show mercy.\n\nRong Bing's eyes revealed a hint of apprehension. Regarding Nature Magic, he understood much more than Ao Lan Empire's Fei Fei. But, the Nature Domain Mu Rong had previously unleashed, also brought him no small shock. That magic seemed to have no discernible rank; it had actually devoured the energy of the Light attribute. Then, could it devour other magic? After a brief thought, Rong Bing did not dwell long on this question, because the opponent he would face today, would be the greatest enemy on his path to winning the championship, Qian Huan Bing Yun from the Ice God Tower.\n\nRong Fei stood at the center of the stage and announced, \"Second match, between Group Two's Number One and Group Two's Number Two, please come up.\"\n\nAs his voice fell, a strong gust of wind suddenly appeared in the Trial Hall. Amidst the wind, a green figure drifted gracefully, landing on the competition stage. It was precisely the Qi Empire's Wind Mage, who had drawn Group Two, Number Two. At this moment, his eyes were full of fighting spirit. He raised his hand and pointed at the silently standing Nian Bing, beckoning him with a finger.\n\nA faint smile appeared on Nian Bing's face. He slowly walked up the elevated stage from the stairs. He didn't walk fast, but every step was very firm. When he stopped ten zhang* from his opponent, that Wind Mage was already a bit impatient.\n\n\"Qi Empire's Wind Mage, Ao Liu.\" He said confidently, even omitting the words \"may I ask.\"\n\nNian Bing still wore a smile. \"Ice Moon Empire Mage Guild's Nian Bing.\" He omitted even more. He didn't even state what attribute of mage he was.\n\nRong Fei's gaze calmly swept over the two of them. He drifted backward, and shouted, \"Second match, begin!\"\n\nThe moment the words \"begin\" were uttered, Ao Liu didn't even take out his magic staff, immediately launching an attack at Nian Bing. The previous Ice Moon Empire Mage Guild representative hadn't even secured a single victory, so facing someone he considered weak, he inevitably became somewhat careless. Over ten wind blades sliced towards Nian Bing at an extremely fast speed, blocking all possible evasion routes for Nian Bing.\n\nThe green wind blades carried a piercing sound of tearing air, each one filled with powerful attack force. Among first-tier instant spells, the speed of Wind attribute was absolutely the fastest.\n\nNian Bing still wore a smile. Dots of blue light appeared out of thin air around his body. The blue light points drifted gracefully. Those were just small ice pellets. This kind of ice pellet, even if it directly hit a person, might not cause much injury. The number of ice pellets perfectly matched the wind blades. Blue lights drew over ten arcs and drifted away.\n\nA surprising scene occurred. The wind blades' attacks were originally chaotic, but the ice pellets precisely hit the exact center of each wind blade. Although this was not enough to destroy the wind blades, it caused the wind blades to lose their attacking capability. When the faint green light reached Nian Bing, it had already transformed into a gentle breeze, caressing his body.\n\n\"Precise magic control.\" This was Rong Fei's assessment of Nian Bing. Ao Liu also hadn't expected Nian Bing to be able to deal with his attack like this, and had no choice but to abandon preparing to cast a powerful spell. With his right hand, a green magic staff reappeared in his hand. The green gem on the staff head shone brightly, strong winds began to spin around his body. At the same time, he sternly said to Nian Bing, \"You are clearly an Ice Mage, why are you wearing a Fire Mage's attire?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled oddly, and said, \"You think I'm an Ice Mage? Then you'll have to look closely.\" As he spoke, a fist-sized ice pellet drifted out, immediately followed by, a fire ball of the same size chasing after the ice pellet. Instantly, he released two spells on the cusp of first and second tier.\n\nThe simultaneous release of ice and fire, immediately shocked most of the audience. Although Ao Liu was surprised, he was, after all, an excellent mage. His reaction was still good. He gritted his teeth and released the secret weapon originally attached to his magic staff. Although this staff of his was not extremely high-grade, it had a special feature: by relying on the Wind attribute gem on the staff, it could store a fourth-tier Wind spell. In a one-on-one magic duel where scrolls could not be used, this gave a great advantage. A small tornado suddenly appeared in front of Ao Liu, directly swirling towards the ice and fire dual-orbs. His plan was simple: not only to destroy Nian Bing's instant attack, but also, to use this staff's instant fourth-tier magic to defeat Nian Bing.\n\nAlthough Ao Liu was a Great Mage, his own strength was not weak, even stronger than his companion who came with him. If he had started properly by relying on his own strength to fight Nian Bing, Nian Bing would have needed to exert more effort to win. But, his carelessness from the very beginning, had already sealed Ao Liu's fate.\n\nThe ice and fire dual-orbs flying in the air were not immutable. During their flight, their volume continuously shrank. By the time the small tornado appeared, the ice and fire dual-orbs had already shrunk to one-fifth of their original size. Although no difference was visible on their surface, within these two tiny magical spheres, the magic elements had already become turbulent due to compression. The fire ball instantly collided with the ice pellet the moment the tornado struck.\n\n*Boom!* A fierce explosion, carrying wind, and three types of elemental energies simultaneously, powerful shockwaves spread in all directions. It shook Ao Liu back several steps. He couldn't understand how, two spells less than second tier could destroy his fourth-tier tornado just like that. But, what surprised him even more was what came next.\n\nFacing an enemy, Nian Bing never had the habit of holding back. Amidst the explosion, a pair of ice and fire dual-orbs had quietly slid past the shockwave from the side and arrived in front of Ao Liu.\n\nA laughable scene occurred. Ao Liu, who didn't have time to resist with magic, actually used his magic staff in hand to strike at the ice and fire dual-orbs. Less than a second after the previous loud bang, another identical roar sounded, only, this time the roar was mixed, accompanied by a shrill scream...\n\nAo Liu's magic staff was gone in the explosion. His mage robe seemed to be a good treasure, as it actually protected his body from being destroyed by the explosive force. Unfortunately, the robe could only protect his torso. His two hands, which had been holding the magic staff, had disappeared. Fresh blood was rapidly flowing from his severed hands.\n\nAo Liu lay on the ground, constantly rolling, due to the intense pain.\n\nThe match had begun quickly, and ended even faster. In less than half the time of the previous match, everything was already over, ending in a tragic manner. The two Water Mage Guides specifically responsible for rescue immediately rushed onto the stage and used magic to stop Ao Liu's bleeding. Everyone knew that, even if he didn't die, he couldn't possibly participate in the subsequent matches.\n\nThe smile on Nian Bing's face did not disappear because of the scene before him. He gently shook his head, thinking to himself, \"If it weren't for that magic robe, I'm afraid Ao Liu's body would also be like those hands, a pity, a pity. He is, after all, a mage, and the ice-fire aura attached to my ice and fire dual-orbs wasn't enough to kill him. It seems, I can only let him go.\"\n\nAs the match ended, the Fire Cloud Barrier naturally dissipated. A blue figure quickly rushed onto the competition stage, pouncing on Nian Bing without any hesitation. That was the aura of water.\n\nNian Bing seemed to have already anticipated it. With a flash of light, a green blade already appeared in his hand. Blue and green lights appeared at his feet, and green wind propelled his body backward, floating. While floating, he rapidly chanted a spell.\n\nThe sudden attacker, was naturally the Water Mage who came with Ao Liu. Seeing his companion's hands cruelly blasted off by Nian Bing, how could he possibly restrain himself? In his rage, he had lost his reason. Instant water arrows continuously rushed towards Nian Bing. Green light gleamed on the blade. The wind blades inherent to the Heaven's Pride Blade easily dismantled the water arrows under Nian Bing's precise control. The green light on the Heaven's Pride Blade continuously surged, and a cruel, cold light appeared in Nian Bing's eyes.\n\nAt this moment, there were six people on the competition stage: besides Nian Bing and the Water Mage who initiated the attack, there was also the nearly unconscious Ao Liu, the two Water Mage Guides treating him, and Rong Fei, who was concerned about Ao Liu's condition.\n\nRong Fei was frowning, looking at Ao Liu's injuries. Suddenly sensing the magical aura on the competition stage, he couldn't help but look up. On the surface, Nian Bing was being forced back step by step by the Water Mage. He couldn't help but frown deeply, and loudly shouted, \"Stop!\"\n\nThe moment the word \"stop\" was uttered, Nian Bing moved. His originally retreating figure instantly stopped. The Heaven's Pride Blade instantly erupted with dazzling green light. The Wind Song Stone emitted a distant sound of wind chimes. In mid-air, a green light condensed into a giant wind blade, over ten zhang long, drifting gracefully. By the time Rong Fei shouted the \"hand\" (part of \"stop\") sound, fresh blood bloomed like flowers.\n\nThe green wind blade was a sixth-tier Wind magic spell, Wind God's Cleave. The Water Mage, in his state of lost reason, how could he possibly withstand such a powerful attack with just the magic items on his body? His body was completely split in two, fresh blood dyed the competition stage red. The lingering power of the Wind God's Cleave left a deep mark on the stage, over two zhang long.\n\nSpeaking of which, the final residual flame of the Wind God's Cleave happened to sweep through the gap between the two Water Mages' bodies, also cleaving Ao Liu on the ground into two. Blood splattered all over the two Water Mage Guides.\n\nNian Bing's face showed a look of panic. \"Ah! I'm sorry! Really, my apologies. In a panic, my magic was hard to control.\"\n\nRong Fei had already arrived beside Nian Bing. The light of flames instantly surged, enveloping Nian Bing within it. \"What ruthless methods.\"\n\nNian Bing lowered his head, and said with a wronged expression, \"I'm sorry, Referee, I really didn't do it on purpose. In a magic competition, it's very difficult to control the power of one's magic. That's why Ao Liu lost his hands. And then you saw what happened later. Ao Liu's companion also didn't distinguish right from wrong, and attacked me as soon as he came up. I only acted to protect myself. He was the one who violated the rules first. If I didn't resist, wouldn't I have been killed by him? That last strike, I also used my full power to protect myself, who knew he was like made of paper, so incredibly weak. As for Ao Liu, it can only be counted as his bad luck; magic doesn't have eyes.\"\n\nThe light in Rong Fei's eyes flickered continuously. Although he didn't care about the death of the Qi Empire mages, this New Generation Mage Grand Tournament was, after all, being held in the Hua Rong Empire. On the very first day of the competition, two contestants from the Qi Empire died so inexplicably. It would indeed be difficult to explain to the Qi Empire. But, what Nian Bing said was logical and reasonable, with no transgression whatsoever. Everything was according to the competition rules. Now, no one could prove that he intentionally killed those two mages.\n\nSeeing the hesitant expression in Rong Fei's eyes, Nian Bing smiled faintly, \"Referee, shouldn't you declare me the winner?\" As he spoke, his gaze swept towards the other contestants below the stage. Except for Rong Bing and Bing Yun, the other contestants couldn't help but feel a sudden chill in their hearts. Nian Bing's ruthless methods couldn't help but make them feel a sense of crisis.\n\nEspecially the two female mages from the Ao Lan Empire, their faces had turned very pale at this moment. Such a bloody scene left a deep impression in their minds.\n\nRong Fei's gaze turned to Prince Rong, who was observing the match. Prince Rong calmly nodded at him. Rong Fei took a deep breath, and then somewhat unwillingly announced Nian Bing as the victor of the second match.\n\nNian Bing walked off the stage with a smile, returning to his previous position. He thought coldly to himself, \"Now I'm at least in eighth place. I didn't hide anything. At the same time, I knew that anyone with eyes could see that I had intentionally pushed those two to their deaths. Giving enemies a chance was playing with my own life. Using their carelessness and anger, these negative emotions, to quickly clear obstacles, why not? Anyway, the fact that I could use multiple attributes of magic would be exposed sooner or later, so exposing it a bit early was nothing. After all, my true strength was far from being fully displayed.\"\n\nAt this moment, the format of the competition became even more subtle due to the disappearance of two contestants. The contestants who should have been celebrating having fewer opponents didn't feel a single hint of joy. Especially the contestants in Group Two, the weak mage in their eyes had suddenly become a formidable killer. For a time, their mindsets underwent some changes.\n\n---\n* A *zhang* is a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters.",

    "content": "Emperor Huatian's gaze fell on Nianbing. Yinuo, beside him, was already speechless with shock. In Yinuo's eyes, Nianbing was a gentle young man with no temper at all, but everything that had just happened was so real. Although Emperor Huatian was surprised, his eyes showed a hint more appreciation. Back then, when he, Prince Rong, and Su Yue were starting their enterprise, they killed countless people; it was precisely through iron-blooded means that the Huarong Empire took shape. This young man, at such an age, could kill enemies without batting an eyelid; he was definitely not a simple person. When did the Ice Moon Empire Magicians' Guild become so strong?\n\nAn unexpected turn was an unexpected turn, but the competition still had to continue. The bloodstains on the stage could not be cleaned immediately. After the two bodies were carried away, Rong Fei announced the start of the third match.\n\nNianbing gave Rongbing an encouraging look. A glint of coldness appeared on Rongbing's face. The moment he stepped onto the competition stage, intense battle intent surged through his entire body. Among everyone present, only he understood Nianbing's full purpose in killing. It wasn't to reduce the number of enemies; more importantly, it was for himself! The Water Magician from Qilu Empire had a bye in the first round, and the next round would have Group 1, Number 1 with a bye. He himself would face this Water Magician, Group 1, Number 5, tomorrow. Nianbing was afraid that he wouldn't be able to recover after fighting Qianhuan Bingyun, which was why he attracted that Water Magician onto the stage and killed him. This way, he would have more time to rest, and today's match would be completely without worries. For his brother's actions, Rongbing felt only gratitude.\n\nQianhuan Bingyun slowly stepped onto the competition stage. Even when Nianbing had killed earlier, her expression hadn't changed in the slightest.\n\n“Rongbing, Fire Magician from the Huarong Empire.” Rongbing deliberately emphasized his name. His goal today was to melt this ice mountain in front of him with his magic.\n\n“Bingyun, Ice and Snow Priest from the Ice God Tower.” Qianhuan Bingyun's melodious voice and cold tone were her distinct characteristics.\n\nRong Fei gave Rongbing a deep look, and after offering him an encouraging glance, immediately announced the start of the match.\n\nThis was the third match of the day, and also the most anticipated and exciting one. Nianbing's gaze grew exceptionally fervent. He waited. He waited for the battle between his brother and the successor of the Ice and Snow Goddess Priest.\n\nThe Fire Cloud Barrier appeared once again. Rong Fei retreated to the side and announced the start of the match.\n\nUnlike the previous two matches, where attacks began immediately, neither Rongbing nor Bingyun moved, for they both wished to deny the other an opportunity. Red flames surged around Rongbing's body, while blue light enveloped Bingyun's. The red and blue colors each occupied half of the competition stage. Although neither had truly launched an attack yet, the ice and fire magical elements in the air had already begun to surge towards each other. A strong scent of gunpowder permeated the air between their four cold gazes.\n\nRongbing moved first. With a flick of his right hand, a magic staff made of red coral appeared in his grasp. Nine fiery red gemstones were inlaid on the staff. With a gentle wave, the fire elements around his body instantly became active. Although it wasn't a divine-grade staff, its power was definitely not insignificant. The situation on the stage suddenly changed. What was originally a distinct blue and red instantly both turned blue. It wasn't that Bingyun's attack had overwhelmed Rongbing's energy; rather, the red flames originally surrounding his body had turned blue. This alone symbolized his strength as an Archmage.\n\nImmense pressure continuously spread towards Bingyun. The aura of ice she emitted gradually shrank towards her own direction under the pressure. However, Bingyun did not move, as if none of this concerned her.\n\nNianbing had experienced the power of blue flames, and he could now also use them. If Fire magic wasn't categorized by the stages of magic that could be cast, then by flame color, it could be divided into three grades: the most common was naturally red flames. When a magician's penetrative power reached a certain level for flames, it symbolized their entry into the Archmage realm. Blue flames were called True Fire, with a heat at least three times that of red flames. The most powerful were purple flames, also known as Heaven's Fire. During his last battle with Prince Rong, Nianbing, even with all his might, couldn't contend against the flame lion condensed by Prince Rong using Heaven's Fire. Heaven's Fire consumed a massive amount of magical power; a Fire Archmage could only unleash a momentary strike even by expending all their might. Any attack launched using Heaven's Fire could reach the eleventh-tier Forbidden Spell level.\n\nRongbing took a step forward and slowly raised the Red Coral Staff in his hand. The blue flames immediately burned even more fiercely. With such an abundance of fire elements as a foundation, no matter what fire magic was used, much casting time would be saved.\n\nAt this moment, among the spectators, Yinuo was the most nervous. Her small hands had already clutched her dress tightly, her delicate body trembling slightly with anxiety, fearing even the slightest harm to her beloved.\n\nBingyun finally moved. Her shoulders swayed slightly, and the previously suppressed ice elements suddenly surged back, pushing back the blue flames that had advanced past the center of the stage. Rongbing felt his vision blur, and nine Bingyuns appeared before him. These were not space magic, but nine ice sculptures condensed from ice. Without a doubt, the real Bingyun was behind one of these ice sculptures. A cold incantation slowly began; Bingyun's attack was about to unfold. To be able to condense nine ice sculptures in an instant so seamlessly, even Nianbing, who was also skilled in ice magic, admitted he couldn't do it. Standing on Rongbing's side, he similarly couldn't find Bingyun's true location.\n\nRongbing knew he couldn't wait any longer. “Great God of Flames! Please allow me to borrow your right hand, to let flames descend upon the world, to engulf all evil forces, to let flames illuminate the earth, and destroy all obstacles in our path.------Hand of the Fire God.” The blue flames ignored the pressure from the ice elements, instantly condensing in front of Rongbing.\n\nNianbing felt a surge of surprise in his heart and gained a new understanding of his brother's strength. He had never imagined that Rongbing would use this magic. Unlike the Hand of the Fire God (Left Hand) that Nianbing frequently used, this Hand of the Fire God (Right Hand) was a ninth-tier magic, only usable by magicians close to the Archmage realm! Nianbing asked himself, he couldn't achieve this. His brother's strength in Fire magic was indeed greater than his own! Huh, wait. Nianbing discovered the problem. Rongbing's body appeared very stable, and there was no sign of excessive magical power consumption, but the nine red gemstones on the magic staff in his hand emitted an eerie glow. Yes, it was the effect of this magic staff that allowed his brother to so smoothly cast the Hand of the Fire God (Right Hand). If that were the case, could his own Roar of the Flame God do the same thing? Yes, it definitely could! The Flame God Stone was a top-tier divine stone! A flash of inspiration struck his mind. Nianbing suddenly realized that he had always kept a treasure trove by his side without excavating it. If he could fully unleash the power of his precious magic blades, then his strength would not be merely at its current level; he should at least be able to reach the pinnacle of an Archmage.\n\nThe Hand of the Fire God (Right Hand) appeared. Compared to the Hand of the Fire God (Left Hand), the right hand was clearly much larger and thicker. Blue flames condensed into a gigantic right hand. The firelight on the blue giant hand receded, and blue armor plates covered the entire huge right hand. Rongbing pointed his staff forward, and the Hand of the Fire God (Right Hand) suddenly shot out, drawing an arc in the air.\n\nThere were no blue flames. The light emitted by the Hand of the Fire God (Right Hand) was surprisingly like ice magic, but the next moment, the nine sculptures vanished without any warning. Not even a trace of water was left; they were completely vaporized by the scorching aura.\n\nRongbing was not excited by the instantaneous destruction of the opponent's ice sculptures, because he realized that Bingyun's figure had already vanished from his perception. The surroundings had completely transformed into a world of ice. Inside the Fire Cloud Barrier was a gigantic ice barrier. The ice barrier was vast and didn't look sturdy, but there was an area directly where Rongbing stood that had no ice, leaving him just enough space to stand. Rong Fei looked in surprise at the continuously solidifying ice in front of him, his brows tightly furrowed, wondering what he was thinking.\n\nRongbing's heart fluttered slightly. He pulled the Hand of the Fire God (Right Hand) back to his front and swiftly unleashed five punches around him, instantly blasting five huge holes in the ice wall that enveloped him. However, he still couldn't find Bingyun's figure. Strange ice chunks continued to condense, some of the solid ice reflecting Rongbing's own image like mirrors. The cold aura continuously pressed inward. Although protected by the Hand of the Fire God (Right Hand), Rongbing could still feel his magical power rapidly depleting.\n\nRongbing did not act rashly. He sent his mental power into the surrounding solid ice, attempting to locate Bingyun's figure. He knew that the magic Bingyun was maintaining would definitely not be easier than his own. Once he locked onto her position and delivered a thunderous strike, she would absolutely be unable to resist. Therefore, he was searching for an opportunity. Even if he only found Bingyun's figure at the last moment, he had the confidence to win. At this moment, he recalled what his grandfather, Prince Rong, had said: when magical power was similar, skill and magical control were the key to a magician's victory.\n\nHis mental power touched the solid ice, and all he could feel was a cold aura. The chill stimulated Rongbing's mental power, causing a dizzy spell in his mind. Maintaining a ninth-tier magic, even with the help of a high-grade magic staff, was extremely strenuous. He couldn't sustain this magic for much longer.\n\nJust then, a sudden change occurred. The ice barrier surrounding Rongbing, which was the same size as the competition stage, suddenly began to spin. At first, it spun slowly, but its rotational speed continuously increased. Ice mist rose from within the ice barrier, and various illusions continuously appeared on the smooth ice surface and within the ice mist.\n\nThe attack Rongbing waited for never came, but the surrounding cold grew ever stronger. He sighed inwardly, thinking, Nianbing, it seems defeating her will depend on you. You must watch carefully. Thinking this, Rongbing suddenly raised the magic staff in his hand high and shouted loudly. The Hand of the Fire God (Right Hand) shot skyward.\n\nDown below the stage, Nianbing similarly couldn't see Bingyun's figure. The massive ice barrier also blocked everyone's view. He wanted to probe with his mental power, but the Fire Cloud Barrier outside was impenetrable to his mental power. Aside from the attack when the ice barrier first formed, Rongbing had not made any further sound. Watching the gigantic ice barrier spin rapidly, Nianbing couldn't help but grow anxious. This Bingyun truly lived up to her moniker of 'Thousand Illusions'; she actually took advantage of his brother's casting of the Hand of the Fire God (Right Hand) to unleash magic that controlled the entire competition stage.\n\nJust as Nianbing wondered if Rongbing could successfully defeat Bingyun, the blue light inside the gigantic ice barrier suddenly intensified greatly. Without any warning, an exceptionally strong explosion occurred. The Fire Cloud Barrier was enveloped in a cloud of ice dust, and the spinning ice barrier was completely shattered into powder. Nianbing's heart jolted greatly. He knew Rongbing had detonated the Hand of the Fire God (Right Hand). Could Rongbing withstand such immense explosive power while inside the ice barrier? Subconsciously, he took a step towards the competition stage.\n\nThe ice mist and fire cloud collided and gradually vanished. Rongbing's figure appeared in the arena. His face was exceptionally pale, and a layer of red flames flickered around his body. A necklace had appeared on his chest, and the red gemstones on it had become dim and lusterless. He relied on the Red Coral Staff in his hand to barely support his body and keep from falling.\n\nBingyun stood not far from Rongbing. Compared to when she first stood on the competition stage, she hadn't changed much, except for her chest continuously rising and falling, evidently having consumed a significant amount of magical power. A magic staff, about a foot long, had appeared in her hand. The entire staff seemed to be condensed from ice, emitting a faint ice mist.\n\nRongbing said with difficulty, “Good, you truly are Qianhuan Bingyun. I am inferior to you in magical variations. Can you tell me the name of the magic you just cast?”\n\nBingyun calmly said, “You are a respectable opponent. What I just cast was the Thousand Illusions Domain, specially created for me by my teacher. In this domain of ice, I am nowhere and everywhere.<sup>1</sup> Although you are strong, you used your great magic too early, which gave me the opportunity to cast the Thousand Illusions Domain. In a world of ice, how could you, a Fire Archmage, possibly win?”\n\n“Thousand Illusions Domain. Good, I concede.” With a \"wah\" sound, Rongbing spat out a mouthful of fresh blood and fell into a coma. However, he still stood on the stage, propped up by the Red Coral Staff, and did not fall down.\n\n“Rongbing!” Yinuo cried out nervously.\n\nA red figure flashed and arrived. Rong Ji appeared on the competition stage. He cast a battle-filled glance at Bingyun, then carried Rongbing's body and left the stage.\n\nNianbing, below the stage, let out a sigh of relief. Although Rongbing had fallen unconscious, he knew it was only due to excessive magical power consumption and a magical impact.\n***\n<sup>1</sup> Literally, \"I am far away and not here\" or \"I am far away and not present.\" This idiomatic expression implies being present yet elusive or undetectable, often used in the context of illusory or intangible presences.",

    "content": "At the same time, he could also tell that Ice Cloud was injured. During the final explosion of the Fire God's Right Hand, her body must have suffered a strong shock. Although she tried her best to maintain her original appearance, the hand holding her staff was trembling slightly. Though not very obvious, Nian Bing still saw it clearly.\n\nThe fourth match was held between Rong Ji, Group 2, Number 3, and the Space Magician from the Olan Empire, Group 2, Number 4. At this time, due to the two Qilu Empire magicians being crippled, the rankings for the two groups had undergone slight changes. Group 1: Number 1 Mu Rong, Number 2 Fei Fei, Number 3 Ice Cloud, Number 4 Rong Bing, Number 5 (deceased). Group 2: Number 1 Nian Bing, Number 2 (deceased), Number 3 Rong Ji, Number 4 Space Magician from the Olan Empire, Number 5 Mu Jing.\n\nAfter Rong Ji helped Rong Bing down, he returned to the Trial Hall. At this time, Yi Nuo also quietly left, clearly to care for her beloved man.\n\nRong Ji didn't say much and directly stepped onto the competition stage. The Space Magician from the Olan Empire was already prepared. Seeing Rong Ji ascend the stage, she smiled slightly at him, revealing a pair of cute little canine teeth. \"I will definitely defeat you. Remember my name, I am Lan Lan, a Space Magician.\"\n\nRong Ji said indifferently, \"Rong Ji, Fire Magician from the Hua Rong Empire.\"\n\nThe smile on Lan Lan's face suddenly vanished. She let out a cold snort and said, \"I won't hold back.\" The hatred between the Olan Empire and Hua Rong Empire had already worsened in the last war. Facing a magician from the enemy nation, fire nearly shot out of Lan Lan's eyes.\n\nRong Ji still had that wooden expression. \"I don't kill women.\"\n\nRong Fei glanced at this grand-nephew of his. He shook his head helplessly. Rong Ji's talent in magic was absolutely no less than Rong Bing's. Unfortunately, he was only interested in magic. Otherwise, the third generation of the Rong family wouldn't have allowed Rong Bing's branch to dominate alone.\n\n\"Match start.\"\n\nLan Lan's reaction was much faster than Rong Ji's. Her small silver magic staff appeared with a flick of her wrist. Taking a step forward, the space around her body suddenly became illusory. Rapidly chanting a spell, she relied on the low-level Spatiotemporal Distortion Magic around her body, rendering ordinary low-level magic ineffective against her.\n\nA rare trace of pity appeared in Rong Ji's eyes. He shook his head, not even taking out his magic staff, and similarly began to chant aloud to himself. Red flames suddenly surged. Unlike Rong Bing, his flames did not burn to the true fire level, turning blue. His chanting speed was very fast, his voice low like a whisper, making it impossible for others to hear the content of his chant. However, the flames around his body became increasingly powerful.\n\nSeeing Rong Ji's chanting method, Nian Bing couldn't help but be startled. He clearly understood the difficulty of this chanting method. Changing the intonation of the chant required a thorough understanding of magic. He had dared to try it, but because he later spent most of his energy on cultivating Mimicry Magic, he hadn't succeeded even now. At this moment, he already regarded this older brother of his clan as the strongest competitor in their group.\n\nLan Lan's chanting speed was also very fast. Perhaps because her magic was of a lower level than Rong Ji's, she actually finished first.\n\n\"Spacetime Reversal.\" Silver light transformed into a halo that spread outwards. Wherever the halo passed, the space on the entire competition stage gradually became distorted. No one knew what she was doing; this seemed to be a unique Space-type magic.\n\nLan Lan couldn't help but feel a little smug in her heart. This magic of hers seemed to be something she had researched herself. It was precisely by relying on this magic that she, as a Space Magician whose attack power was relatively weaker among all types, was able to participate in this competition.\n\nRong Ji opened his eyes and stared blankly at the approaching silver halo. The flames around his body suddenly rushed out. However, when the flames met the silver halo, they unexpectedly reversed and flew back, charging towards Rong Ji instead.\n\nRong Ji did not panic. He merely looked at Lan Lan and shook his head.\n\nLan Lan said, slightly angered, \"Why are you shaking your head? Do you think you can still win? No matter what magic you use, under the effect of Spacetime Reversal, it will be cast upon yourself. Hurry up and surrender, I'll spare your life.\"\n\nRong Ji calmly said, \"You're too pleased with yourself. Although your magic is unique, I myself am fire. Even if the magic backfires, what then? No matter what magic it is, no matter what effect it has, its capacity has limits. Take my attack. Meteor Fire Shower.\" Red light condensed into spheres around his body. Although the silver halo had already enveloped his body, Rong Ji seemed unaware. Meteors, meteors condensed from fire, appeared one by one. From the initial three or five, they gradually became dozens. Each one carried an exceptionally violent aura. Rong Ji did not launch an attack at Lan Lan, nor did he control these fire meteors; he let them continuously fly around on the competition stage.\n\nSeeing this, Nian Bing's eyes lit up. He had understood Rong Ji's method. Although Lan Lan's magic was very strange, the main point of her magic was to form a spatial force field on the competition stage. Within this spatial domain, attacks launched by opponents towards her would be reflected back. But this domain, after all, had a certain capacity for endurance. If the attacking magic within the domain reached a certain level, the domain would inevitably cease to exist. Rong Ji's method was very overbearing; it was simply relying on his magic power, superior to the opponent's, to win. Although this method wasn't clever, it was undoubtedly very effective.\n\nSounds like breaking glass vessels came from the competition stage. The fire meteors controlled by Rong Ji exploded one after another, even affecting Rong Fei's side. Each explosion caused the entire competition stage to shake violently, and the sound like shattering glass became even more apparent.\n\nFinally, Spacetime Reversal could no longer function, and dozens of fire meteors were already upon Lan Lan's body. As long as Rong Ji willed it, he could turn the little Space-type girl into ashes.\n\nLan Lan's expression changed drastically. \"You cheated, you cheated. Wuwu.\" Facing defeat, she actually cried.\n\nRong Ji was stunned. It was his first time facing such a situation. He hastily withdrew his fire meteors and said somewhat woodenly, \"You lost.\"\n\nLan Lan glared resentfully at Rong Ji, tears continuously streaming down her pretty face. \"You're the one who lost, you cheated.\"\n\nRong Ji frowned deeply. For a moment, he didn't know what to say. Rong Fei, standing by, also felt somewhat dumbfounded. \"The Olan Empire is too childish, aren't they? The contestants they sent are actually so fragile, like children.\"\n\nThe match ended like a farce. Although Lan Lan was unwilling to admit it, she had indeed lost.¹\n\nEmperor Huatian announced that all contestants who won on the first day of the competition would receive a reward of one hundred purple gold coins. The matches would continue tomorrow. Contestants with a bye could skip coming.\n\nNian Bing was anxious about his brother's condition. Just as he was struggling to search in the distance, Yi Nuo appeared.\n\n\"Nian Bing, come. Your brother asked me to call you over.\" Yi Nuo's eyes were a bit red and swollen, clearly having cried.\n\nNian Bing was overjoyed. He quickly stepped forward and asked, \"Sister-in-law. How is my brother? Is he seriously injured?\"\n\nYi Nuo glanced at the dispersing crowd around them and said, \"Come with me first.\" Under her guidance, the two walked towards the interior of the imperial palace. With Yi Nuo's status, naturally no one would obstruct them. As they walked, Yi Nuo said to Nian Bing, \"Your brother's injury isn't too serious. Thanks to the Fire Cloud Necklace he was wearing, most of the impact from the Fire God's Right Hand's explosion was neutralized. However, this defeat was a great blow to his spirit. You need to try and persuade him more. You also know the relationship between the Hua Rong Empire and the Ice Moon Empire. Your Rong family and the Ice God Tower have always been mortal enemies. This defeat...\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. He said, \"Sister-in-law, don't worry, I'll persuade him more.\"\n\nWhen Nian Bing arrived at the place where Rong Bing was recuperating, he was surprised to find that Yi Nuo had actually brought Rong Bing into her own boudoir. Nian Bing couldn't help but secretly smile wryly. He stopped outside the door. \"Sister-in-law, you and my brother aren't officially married yet. It seems inappropriate for you to have him recuperating here, and is it suitable for me to go in?\"\n\nYi Nuo snorted and said, \"What's inappropriate about it? I don't believe anyone would dare to speak nonsense. Even Grandpa wouldn't object. If anyone speaks nonsense, I'll cut out their tongue. Hurry and come in with me, aren't you worried?\"\n\nRong Bing lay quietly on Yi Nuo's bed, staring at the ceiling. His gaze was a little hazy, as if he was thinking about something. He didn't even notice Nian Bing and Yi Nuo entering.\n\nYi Nuo whispered to Nian Bing, \"You talk to him. It's easier for you men to communicate. Nian Bing, you really must help him more! Besides you, I really can't think of anyone who could help him recover.² Do you know? Ever since you arrived, Rong Bing has smiled more in this period than he has in all the years I've known him combined. I'm even a little jealous.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded at Yi Nuo, saying nothing more, but his eyes had already told Yi Nuo everything.\n\nYi Nuo seemed to let out a sigh of relief. She slowly retreated and closed the door.\n\n\"Brother, I'm here.\" Nian Bing walked to the bedside and sat down.\n\nA bit more spirit entered Rong Bing's gaze as he looked at Nian Bing. \"You saw it all, I lost.\" His voice was very calm, devoid of any dejected air.\n\nNian Bing sighed softly and said, \"Winning or losing isn't important. Losing this time doesn't mean you'll lose in the future, does it?\"\n\nA hint of a smile appeared on Rong Bing's face as he said, \"Don't worry, I can handle this blow. I had Yi Nuo call you here not because I wanted to hear you comfort me. I want to hear your thoughts on Thousand Illusions Ice Cloud's magic.\"\n\nNian Bing then felt relieved. \"That woman's magic is indeed very powerful. What's with this Thousand Illusions Domain she mentioned? I couldn't see any changes from the outside. Brother, you were in it, so you should have felt it most deeply. However, did you notice one thing? Although she won, she was also injured.\"\n\nRong Bing proudly said, \"Of course. As fellow Arch Mages, if she could completely defeat me, then I would have wasted all these years practicing magic.\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment and said, \"Brother, what was the situation then? How exactly did you lose? Also, what exactly is this so-called 'Domain'? I've seen the concept of 'Domain' in some magic books too, but I've never quite understood it. What is a Domain? Does it just refer to the range covered by magic?\"\n\nRong Bing shook his head and said, \"Of course it's not that simple. A magic domain isn't something mysterious. Every magician can possess their own domain; it's just that the strength of the domain varies. A so-called domain refers to a space constructed based on one's own magic, according to one's imagination. The stronger the magic power, the larger this space. And because this constructed space is created according to the magician's own will, it produces specific effects within it. For example, the domain Thousand Illusions Ice Cloud used today, its most obvious characteristic was the exclusion of all magic elements except ice elements. Within her domain, my magic power would be consumed at a faster rate and could not be replenished. Although I finally shattered her domain with the explosion of the Fire God's Right Hand, I faintly felt that the capabilities within her domain were not truly unleashed. There's a strong possibility that some secret still lies within it, after all, it was a domain she completed under the guidance of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess; its variations couldn't be that simple. The reason Thousand Illusions Ice Cloud was injured wasn't because her domain wasn't strong enough, but because she didn't expect me to risk injuring myself by making the Fire God's Right Hand self-destruct, which is why I was able to harm her. Nian Bing, if you encounter her, you must be careful. Her control over ice elements has reached the point of being 'like an arm commanding a finger'*. Especially this Thousand Illusions Domain, the best way to deal with it is to not let it unleash its power.\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment and said, \"Brother, her magic power also seems to be at the Arch Mage level, but during your battle, did you feel that her magic aura seemed purer than yours? This allows her to achieve the same effect by consuming less magic power. Although your magic powers were equal at the start, even if she didn't use that Thousand Illusions Domain, in a gradually progressing battle, her magic power would gradually gain the upper hand.\"\n\nRong Bing glanced at Nian Bing with some surprise. Recalling the previous battle, he nodded in deep agreement. \"The bystander sees most clearly.⁴ You're right. Her magic purity is very high. I always thought my own magic purity was quite good, but compared to hers, it's quite a bit worse. What's going on? Is the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess really that miraculous? Or does she possess some special magic item?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"Only she herself probably knows a secret like that. Brother, don't worry. When I encounter her, I will definitely avenge you.\"\n___\n¹ The original text \"但她畢竟不是輸了\" literally means \"but she after all was not lost.\" Given the context, this is interpreted as a typographical error in the source text, and the meaning \"she had indeed lost\" is rendered.\n² The original text uses \"認主,\" which literally means \"to recognize a master\" (often for a magical item).

    "content": "Rong Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Of course, I have faith in you. Your magical variations are no less than hers, Nian Bing. Listen to me: unless absolutely necessary, don't kill too much. I know most of what you did in today's match was for me, but making too many enemies is clearly unwise, do you understand?\"\n\nA cold glint flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. \"Brother, you saw through it.\"\n\nRong Bing nodded and said, \"It's a pity. I made you worry for nothing. I still lost in the end.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"Did you hear what that magician named Ao Liu said to me on stage during today's match? At that point, he was already my enemy, and in front of Prince Rong, I would never show weakness.\"\n\nRong Bing sighed inwardly. He knew that Nian Bing's estrangement from the Rong family still existed. After all, the deaths of Rong Tian and his wife had impacted him greatly, and it couldn't be easily resolved by a few comforting words and family affection.\n\n\"Nian Bing, I won't advise you further, but you must protect your heart and not let it be swallowed by demons. Excessive killing will not only affect your heart but also your magic. Do you understand?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Brother, I'll remember what you said. You can rest assured, I distinguish clearly between benefactors and enemies. Someone once advised me like this too, but can I not seek revenge? I cannot. Neither could you. The hatred for one's parents is irreconcilable.¹ As long as I can avenge them, even if I truly become a demon, I'll do it.\"\n\nRong Bing was startled. It was the first time he had seen Nian Bing display such an extreme side. He couldn't help but feel greatly worried, yet at this moment, he truly didn't know how to persuade his brother.\n\n\"Brother, get some good rest. Sister-in-law is really good to you! To let you recuperate in her boudoir. Although you don't have a match tomorrow, it's still good to take care of your body. Don't overexert yourself at night.\" Nian Bing teased Rong Bing, making the previously heavy atmosphere in the room lighten up again.\n\nRong Bing laughed and scolded, \"You rascal, always teasing me. Hurry back. Feng Nü is still waiting for you.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded slightly and said, \"Brother, although I don't have a match tomorrow, I'll still come over. I'll observe the other people's matches then, and analyze their strengths to make my plans.\"\n\nRong Bing nodded and said, \"Judging by today's matches, besides Qianhuan Yun, the strongest are you and Rong Ji. While Mu Rong's natural magic also has domain variations, he needs too much time. With your strength and mine, we wouldn't give him such an opportunity; fire doesn't promote plant growth. As for his sister, who hasn't fought yet, she shouldn't be too strong. You have a bye in the next round, and then you'll face Mu Jing. Be careful then, there shouldn't be any problems. However, if you want to win the final championship, you must defeat Rong Ji. Although I didn't see Rong Ji's performance earlier, I imagine he won against that Aolan Empire magician quite easily, right?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and carefully recounted Rong Ji's earlier performance. Hearing Nian Bing's narration, Rong Bing was also startled. \"You're saying Rong Ji has found a way to shorten incantations? Meteor Shower is no ordinary spell. Even I would struggle to use this spell if not relying on a magic staff, but he can not only chant the incantation quickly but also skillfully control it not to harm people. It seems Rong Ji's overall strength is no weaker than mine. He doesn't know your identity, so if you meet, he probably won't hold back. You must be careful; we absolutely cannot have brothers harming each other.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"Brother, do you think I'll hold back against him? Let the battle with Rong Ji be my final tune-up² before I face Qianhuan Bingyun. As long as he isn't an Archmage yet, I'm confident of victory.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Miss, are you injured?\" an exclamation came from inside the carriage.\n\nSince leaving the Ice God Tower, Qianhuan Bingyun had remained inside her carriage, not even leaving for meals.\n\n\"It's fine, just some shock to my meridians. He truly is a descendant of the Rong family; his magic intensity is not weaker than mine. If not for the marvelous use of the Qianhuan Domain, it wouldn't have been easy for me to win against him. No one from the Rong family is simple. I still have two strong enemies to face.\"\n\n\"Miss, should we inform the Seventh Prince of your current condition? I remember he said he brought many healing elixirs with him; they should be beneficial for your injuries.\"\n\n\"No need. I don't want anyone to know about my injuries. However, today's match was strange. The magician from the Bingyue Empire Magicians' Guild, who was originally just a chicken rib,³ greatly exceeded my expectations. He and another competitor from the Rong family are both obstacles to my final victory.\"\n\n\"Miss, who did the Bingyue Empire send this time? It should be Long Zhi's daughter, right? Is she very strong?\"\n\n\"No, it's not Long Zhi's daughter. It's a young man. His name seems to be Nian Bing, which sounds a bit familiar. Wasn't the chef in Aolan City last time also named Nian Bing?\"\n\n\"Then should I call the Seventh Prince over to ask?\"\n\n\"Forget it, I need to rest. There's another battle tomorrow. Before I left, Master instructed me that no matter what, I must win the championship in this Huarong Empire competition. I was a bit careless today, but from tomorrow onwards, I won't relax again.\" Her cold voice was filled with chill.\n\n\"May the glory of the Ice and Snow Goddess forever shine upon you.\"\n\n...\n\nNian Bing left the imperial palace and slowly walked towards the inn. Although he had deliberately made the atmosphere lighter at the end, Rong Bing's words had deeply touched his heart. *Will killing truly turn me into a demon? Why would it be this way? Dad, Mom, how I wish you were still alive. Nian Bing misses you so much! So many years have passed, yet I still don't have the ability to ascend the Ice God Tower. But don't worry, no matter what others say, I will definitely avenge you. Even if it costs me my life, I won't let that Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess live easily.* Thinking of revenge, he couldn't help but recall Galamandis, the Fire Dragon King, who had helped him the most after he left Peach Blossom Forest.\n\nGalamandis, when will you finally return? As soon as this competition ends, I'll have all seven magic knives. And then I can complete Mimicry Magic. I still need your guidance! Please come back quickly.\n\nIn Nian Bing's heart, Galamandis felt like a teacher and friend to him. At first, he cooked for Galamandis purely for survival, but as his understanding of Galamandis deepened, he gradually realized that although Galamandis was crude in speech, he was indeed worthy of the title Fire Dragon King. From when Nian Bing first met him until his departure,⁴ though Galamandis spoke harshly, he never killed a single human, and all the forms of torment he inflicted on Nian Bing had also brought him considerable benefits. He even imparted the miraculous Mimicry Magic to him. These kindnesses led Nian Bing to abandon all prejudices when cooking for Galamandis later on, genuinely preparing meals for him. Galamandis had been gone for some time. Nian Bing missed him, trusting his jocular voice, his feigned demeanor, and his vast and profound knowledge.\n\nNian Bing, walking deep in thought, didn't notice a very fat man standing by the side of the street. This胖子 man was over two meters tall, with a huge neck like several water vats stacked together. He was holding a bag of food and constantly stuffing it into his mouth. His tiny eyes, squeezed by fat, were staring at Nian Bing.\n\n\"Hmm, this kid should be the one who appeared in the Bingyue Empire, right? My precious stomach! You're about to have a feast! Hmm, according to the news I scouted two days ago, he seems to be participating in some competition. I'll wait a few more days, hehe. Kid, you won't escape my grasp. I wonder if the delicacies he makes are as exaggerated as those guys from Qingfeng Zhai said. I hope so.\"\n\nNian Bing suddenly felt his mental energy tremble slightly, and his ears inexplicably warmed. Guided by his mental energy, he subconsciously looked in one direction, but he saw only air. What was going on? Was someone following him? No, was it those guys from the Phoenix Clan again? Thinking this, his heart tightened imperceptibly. When his rationality encountered matters concerning Feng Nü, he often became a little flustered.\n\nHe rushed back to the inn at top speed. Feng Nü was meditating in the room. Seeing Feng Nü safe and sound, Nian Bing couldn't help but sigh in relief, but he was completely unaware that his actions had been clearly observed by a pair of tiny eyes.\n\nFeng Nü sensed Nian Bing's presence and woke from her meditation. \"You're back.\" Her voice was very calm.\n\n\"Aren't you going to ask about the result of my match today?\" Nian Bing smiled as he looked at the woman he loved.\n\nFeng Nü shook her head, stepped forward, and melted into his embrace. \"I knew you would win, so there's no need to ask.\" After saying this, she tightened her arms around Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing felt a surge of emotion. The warmth from Feng Nü's body already told him that she was not as relaxed as she claimed. Her heartbeat and skin temperature proved that she hadn't entered a meditative state of quiet cultivation earlier.\n\n\"Silly girl, are you hungry? I'll cook for you. It's already past noon.\" Nian Bing gently stroked Feng Nü's pink long hair, his heart filled with tenderness.\n\nFeng Nü looked up at Nian Bing, a hint of a smile in her eyes. \"No, you just finished your match. You must be tired. You don't need to cook for me today.\"\n\nNian Bing was startled for a moment. Feng Nü had always been very dependent on his cooking skills. \"Then what should we do? Should we eat out? But those vegetables we bought yesterday will spoil if we don't eat them soon.\"\n\nFeng Nü gestured mysteriously, pointing to the table, and said, \"I've always made you cook for me. Today, I've prepared a delicious meal for you to taste.\"\n\nOnly then did Nian Bing notice that the table was covered with a cloth, supported by swords.⁵ Feng Nü stepped forward and uncovered the cloth, revealing six dishes and one soup inside.\n\nNian Bing exclaimed in surprise, \"When did you learn to cook? I remember you only knew how to make porridge before!\"\n\nFeng Nü giggled, stepped forward, and hugged Nian Bing's arm, saying, \"Having followed a master chef like you for so long, I learned just by watching! Don't you think I'm very smart?\"\n\nNian Bing praised, \"You are indeed very smart. It looks like you did well. Cooking emphasizes color, aroma, and taste. From the color alone, you could already graduate from apprenticeship. Today, I'll taste my future wife's culinary skills.\" As he spoke, he picked up his chopsticks, his heart filled with warmth. What could be more wonderful than his future wife preparing a meal and waiting for him to return and taste it? However, he was completely unaware that his nightmare was about to begin.\n\nNian Bing was indeed a little hungry. He eagerly picked up a mouthful of food with his chopsticks and put it into his mouth. After chewing just once, the smile on his face instantly froze. *This... is this delicious?* His gaze turned to Feng Nü, who was looking at him expectantly. Forcibly suppressing the urge to vomit, he managed to swallow the dish, which tasted only salty and nothing else.\n\n\"How is it? How is it? Is it delicious?\" Feng Nü asked, looking at Nian Bing with some excitement. After all, this was her first time cooking so many complex dishes.\n\nNian Bing forced out a smile and praised, \"Good, truly delicious. Anything you make is an earthly delight.\"\n\nFeng Nü said proudly, \"See how smart I am? I learned so quickly just by watching you cook.\"\n\nNian Bing probed, \"You should eat too! There are so many dishes.\"\n\nFeng Nü said, \"I got hungry after you left, so I went out and ate a lot. Then I came back and was busy cooking for you. I'm still quite full now and can't eat any more. These were specially made for you to eat. Your appetite isn't smaller than mine, so eat it all, okay? Don't waste my efforts.\"\n\nNian Bing swallowed hard. Looking at Feng Nü's gentle-as-water eyes, he smiled, as if the table before him truly held a feast. He no longer showed any discomfort, swiftly putting the dishes into his mouth, chewing quickly, swallowing quickly, eating with great gusto. Like a strong wind sweeping away clouds, he consumed all the food.\n\nFeng Nü watched contentedly as Nian Bing ate all the food. \"Is it delicious?\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Feng Nü tenderly and said, \"Of course it's delicious.\"\n\n\"Then I'll cook for you every day from now on, alright? How about this: you cook for me, and I'll cook for you.\"\n\nLooking at Feng Nü's expectant gaze, Nian Bing smiled and nodded, \"Alright! Let's start with dinner tonight then. I need to meditate now, to review the problems that arose in today's match and the strengths of the other competitors.\"\n\n---\n¹ *父母之仇不共戴天 (fùmǔ zhī chóu bù gòng dài tiān)*: A Chinese idiom that literally means \"the hatred for one's parents is such that one cannot live under the same sky as the enemy.\" It conveys an irreconcilable, sworn vengeance.\n² *掃射 (sǎoshè)*: Literally \"strafing\" or \"sweeping shot.\" In this context, it metaphorically implies a powerful, decisive preliminary action or a final test before a major confrontation. \"Tune-up\" or \"final rehearsal\" could also fit, but \"tune-up\" better captures the sense of preparing oneself.\n³ *雞肋 (jīlèi)*: A Chinese idiom literally meaning \"chicken rib.\" It refers to something that is of little value or benefit, yet one is reluctant to discard it.\n⁴ *直到他斌 (zhídào tā bīn)*: The original text uses the character \"斌\" (bīn).

    "content": "Feng Nü nodded: \"Alright, you meditate. I'll guard you.\"\n\nOne *shichen*¹ later, Feng Nü, who was guarding Nianbing, suddenly found Nianbing's face very pale, with large drops of sweat streaming down his forehead. Startled, she quickly flashed to Nianbing's side, reached out to press his shoulder, and carefully injected Nine-Departure Battle Qi into Nianbing's body to check his condition, fearing he might suffer *qi deviation*².\n\nSoon, Feng Nü discovered that the flow of Nianbing's meridians and qi and blood within his body was somewhat chaotic, especially near his *Dantian*³, where the qi and blood were circulating very quickly, showing signs of wild surges. She hastily gathered the Nine-Departure Battle Qi and directed it to help Nianbing regulate his chaotic energy.\n\nNianbing's complexion gradually improved. He opened his eyes and said, \"Feng Nü, I'm fine. I need to go to the restroom.\"\n\nIn the early morning, as sunlight streamed into the room, Nianbing practically crawled out of the toilet. The sensation of his entire body aching was absolutely unbearable, and the figures before his eyes had already doubled. However, this time, he felt he had finally been completely liberated.\n\nFeng Nü, waiting outside the toilet, quickly stepped forward to support him. \"How are you? Feeling any better?\"\n\nNianbing nodded weakly, saying feebly, \"This is the how many times?\"\n\nFeng Nü forced a smile: \"The twenty-third time. How can this be? Are you poisoned? Since you came back yesterday, you've been going almost every half shichen. You shouldn't participate in today's competition.\"\n\nNianbing forced a smile and said, \"Don't worry, I'm fine. I happen to have a bye today. I want to sleep for a bit. I'm much better now. Can you cook some porridge for me at noon?\"\n\nFeng Nü nodded in agreement and helped Nianbing lie down on the bed. Waves of weakness washed over him, yet Nianbing's heart was very calm. He closed his eyes, tightly held Feng Nü's small hand, feeling a warmth in his heart. Although he had gone to the toilet so many times, he didn't blame Feng Nü at all. Even if he were to do it all over again, he would still eat all that food.\n\nConsciousness gradually faded in a daze. Nianbing, who had replaced sleep with meditation for a long time, finally entered deep slumber once more.\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, urgent knocking on the door startled Nianbing awake from his dream. He opened his eyes to find Feng Nü looking at him. After a nap, he felt much better physically. \"Go open the door. It's probably my brother.\"\n\nFeng Nü agreed, then released the hand Nianbing had been holding, quickly walked to the door, and opened it.\n\nIndeed, Yinuo and Rongbing were standing outside the door. As soon as Rongbing saw Feng Nü, he eagerly asked, \"Feng Nü, where's my brother? Why didn't he go to the imperial palace today?\"\n\nFeng Nü invited them into the room and said with a wry smile, \"Go see for yourselves. He's been sick since yesterday. I wanted to call a doctor for him, but he wouldn't agree no matter what. He's much better now, just still a bit weak.\"\n\nRongbing was stunned for a moment, then hastily walked into the inner room. Seeing Nianbing, he was shocked. Was this still his younger brother? After only one day apart, why was his face sallow, his eye sockets sunken, his body clearly in a semi-exhausted state, his eyes lifeless, and the originally dense magical fluctuations around his body gone?\n\n\"Nianbing, what happened to you? How did you end up like this?\"\n\nNianbing said, \"Brother, Sister-in-law, you're here. Please sit down quickly. I knew you'd come looking since I didn't go to the imperial palace today. How's your body? Have you recovered?\"\n\nRongbing said eagerly, \"I'm fine, don't talk about me first. What's wrong with you?\"\n\nNianbing forced a smile: \"It's nothing, just a bit of stomach discomfort. I'm much better now. Don't worry, I won't miss tomorrow's competition.\"\n\nFeng Nü snapped impatiently, \"Still nothing? From yesterday when you came back until this morning, you went to the toilet a full twenty-three times! How can that be 'nothing'? In your current state, your *vital energy*⁴ won't recover by tomorrow. How can you participate?\"\n\nRongbing's brow furrowed slightly. He said, \"What exactly happened? Nianbing, tell me, did someone poison you?\"\n\nNianbing shook his head. \"Brother, I'm really fine. Since I didn't go today, what's the competition like? Who won?\"\n\nRongbing said, \"Today's matches proceeded very quickly. Our first group, naturally, Qianhuan Bingyun won again, and Murong had a bye. That light-elementalist lost to Qianhuan Bingyun. Because *in that instance*, Nianbing killed those two guys from the Qilu Empire yesterday, both group matches became only one match each. In your group, Rongji also had a bye, and that spatial mage lost to Mujing. The only thing that struck me as a bit off was Mujing. Her nature magic is actually a bit more powerful than her brother's, and she seems to have already reached the level of a *Magus*⁵. Tomorrow's match is between you and Mujing. You must be careful. However, in your current state, can you really participate in the match?\"\n\nNianbing smiled slightly: \"Don't worry, my body is very well. I don't need to go to the toilet anymore. After a day of rest, it shouldn't be a big problem. Brother, you should be making an appearance tomorrow too. You should still have a bye tomorrow, right? That way you can get an extra day of rest.\"\n\nRongbing nodded and said, \"I have a bye tomorrow, but I truly wish it was you who had the bye tomorrow. Your current state...\"\n\nNianbing shook his head and said, \"So what if Mujing is a Magus? I will definitely defeat her.\"\n\nRongbing sighed lightly, \"Alright then, you rest well. Yinuo and I will head back first. Are you really sure you don't need to see a doctor?\"\n\nNianbing said, \"No need. I'm fine now, and my magic power is very abundant. I just need to recover some physical strength, and I'll be fine. After all, we're mages, not warriors.\"\n\nRongbing and Yinuo left. Feng Nü brought a bowl of porridge to Nianbing. Using Nine-Departure Battle Qi, she warmed the porridge, then fed it to Nianbing spoonful by spoonful. Although the porridge Feng Nü cooked couldn't be called delicious, it wouldn't be poison anymore. Suddenly, a glint flashed in Feng Nü's eyes, as if she remembered something. While feeding porridge to Nianbing, she said, \"Or, should I go find that mage named Mujing?\"\n\nNianbing was startled. \"What do you want to find her for?\"\n\n\"If I just injure her, then you won't have to compete tomorrow, right?\" Feng Nü didn't want Nianbing's body to be in danger. After all, in that instance Nianbing had once killed Murong and Mujing's servants; the opponent would absolutely show no mercy. She was very worried in her heart.\n\nNianbing smiled slightly: \"No need. Trust me, I will definitely win. You heard what I just told Brother. I'm a mage! At worst, I'll just use a few magic spells. Mujing relies only on the strangeness of nature magic. For me, strangeness has no effect. I've already figured out a way to deal with her. Don't worry.\"\n\n\"Really? You're not allowed to lie to me. If you suffer any injury, I...\"\n\n\"Don't worry, I still need to come back and eat your delicious food! Mmm, after drinking the porridge you cooked, I feel much better. I'm going to start meditating. You've guarded me all day, you should rest for a while too.\"\n\n\"No need. You meditate, I'll guard you.\"\n\nMiscellaneous thoughts in his mind gradually vanished, and Nianbing slowly entered the ethereal state of meditation. After entering meditation, he was surprised to find that his body's weakness instead made his mental perception exceptionally clear. It was as if he could clearly feel everything outside himself. Blue and red magical elements continuously gathered within his body under the influence of his mental power, converging into the two light spheres, upper and lower, within him, calmly circulating, just as Nianbing had judged. The weakness of his body did not affect the intensity of his magic power; as it continuously gathered, his magic power gradually grew towards its peak state.\n\nThe sensitivity of his mental power gave Nianbing many thoughts. The first thing he thought of was the scene of Rongbing using his magic staff during the first day's competition. Although that magic staff was not weak, it was clearly no match for his own Roar of the God of Fire. However, he himself was far inferior in its use. Although his six magic blades could also amplify his magic, the amplification was not obvious. Indeed! He had six treasuries by his side. If he could fully unlock these six treasuries, how much help would it be to him? Thinking this, Nianbing subconsciously directed his mental power to explore his Space Ring.\n\nThe Space Ring was originally Nianbing's possession, and its aura was connected to him. This was also why Nianbing no longer needed to hold the Sigh of the Goddess of Ice and Snow and the Roar of the God of Fire in his hands while meditating. As long as there was a mental connection, he could still easily connect with his magic blades. Although they were stored within the ring, their ability to assist Nianbing's meditation had not diminished in the slightest. Six familiar clusters of light appeared before Nianbing's mental power. The first one Nianbing chose was the Sun-Rectifying Blade, the one he was most familiar with. After all, when he was young, the first magic he cultivated was fire-element magic.\n\nInside the Space Ring, the Sun-Rectifying Blade was a cluster of red light, shimmering and filled with surging fire aura. Nianbing opened his mental power, slowly enveloped this fire aura, and clearly felt its every subtle change. What he sought were changes that could be utilized by himself; only then could he fully unleash the power of this divine fire blade. This was his first time using mental power to probe the Sun-Rectifying Blade. When Nianbing's mental power entered the domain of the Sun-Rectifying Blade⁶, he was surprised to find that what appeared before him was a sea of fire, a vast ocean of fire. The Sun-Rectifying Blade seemed to be roaring deeply. The closer he got to the core of this domain, the greater Nianbing found his mental power consumption to be. Gradually, everything around him had turned from red to blue, then from blue to purple, and everything became like a mist. Nianbing's mental power was compressed into a small ball by the surging Heavenly Fire energy, barely able to protect itself, but utterly unable to delve deeper. However, he vaguely felt that at the core of this Sun-Rectifying Blade, something was calling to him—an unusually familiar sensation. A flash of inspiration appeared as his mental power was pushed back bit by bit under pressure. Nianbing suddenly understood: the core of this Sun-Rectifying Blade was its soul! And its soul, wasn't it formed by his own blood combined with the aura of the God of Fire's Stone? As long as his mental power could reach the soul within the blade, then this divine fire blade could be completely controlled by him, and its energy could be fully utilized by him. At that time, it would truly be the Roar of the God of Fire!\n\nThinking this, Nianbing's heart suddenly cleared. If it was so for the Sun-Rectifying Blade, wasn't it the same for every other blade? Although he understood this, he did not continue to advance towards the core of the Sun-Rectifying Blade, because he knew that with his current strength, he probably couldn't control these top-tier divine blades. Mental power was limited, and he still had to face a strong enemy tomorrow. Now was not the time for excessive consumption. After everything calmed down, he would find another opportunity to see if he could break through the obstruction of this internal energy. Thinking this, Nianbing carefully withdrew his mental power from the Sun-Rectifying Blade and quietly meditated.\n\nWhen Nianbing awoke from his meditation, the predawn glow of 'fish belly white'⁷ was already visible outside the window, gradually rising from the east. After a night of meditation and adjustment, his physical condition had significantly improved.\n\n\"You're awake. Have some more porridge.\" Feng Nü's gentle voice sounded. A steaming bowl of white porridge was brought before Nianbing. Looking at the concern in Feng Nü's eyes, Nianbing smiled faintly: \"I'm fine now.\"\n\nHanding the porridge to Nianbing, Feng Nü still said with some worry, \"Are you really okay? Today's competition...\"\n\nNianbing quickly poured the warm⁸ porridge into his stomach, then sprang from the bed, stretching his somewhat stiff body. \"Really, I'm fine. Would I lie to you?\" He reached out and embraced Feng Nü's supple, proud body, feeling the harmony in their contact. A sense of satisfaction welled up spontaneously, and he unconsciously lowered his head to gently kiss Feng Nü's slender, jade-like neck.\n\nFeng Nü shrank her neck, laughing, \"Stop it, that tickles. Judging by your appearance, you really are better. Be careful in today's competition. I'll prepare food at home and wait for you.\"\n\nNianbing cupped Feng Nü's pretty face, gently kissing her alluring red lips. \"I'll be back soon. Let me hold you for a while.\" He loved the feeling of holding Feng Nü the most; with their hearts close, it was so wonderful. Only when holding Feng Nü would the hatred in his heart temporarily subside. At this moment, Nianbing couldn't help but recall Rongbing's words, sighing inwardly. Perhaps, he truly had been blinded by hatred. He tightened his arms. Feng Nü's body was very warm⁹, warming his body, and warming his heart.\n\nAfter a long time, the sun outside had already shone into the room, bathing both their bodies. Feng Nü seemed to have fallen asleep, her head resting on Nianbing's shoulder. Nianbing gently stroked her long hair, feeling the graceful curves of Feng Nü's delicate body. An indescribable comfort filled his heart. \"Feng Nü, do you think I should be fixated on seeking revenge?\"\n\nFeng Nü still kept her eyes closed and said, \"Revenge must be sought. The hatred for one's parents is *irreconcilable with heaven*¹⁰; as a child, how can one not avenge them? However, Nianbing, you must understand that your enemy is only the Priestess of the Goddess of Ice and Snow, not everyone else. Don't lose hope in this world because of hatred, okay? I know you suffered a lot in your childhood, and for these past years, you've *always been leading yourself*¹¹, but there are still many warm places in this world. You still have family, and you have me. I understand that your heart has been closed and cold because of hatred. Don't be like this anymore, okay? I want to see your sunny side, to see your sunny smile. Your heart is kind, it's just that sometimes due to hatred, you become overly extreme and turn cold. Do you understand what I mean?\"\n\n---\n¹ *Shichen*: A traditional Chinese unit of time, equivalent to two hours.\n² *Qi deviation*: The Chinese term '走火入魔' (zǒuhuǒ rùmó) describes a state where one's cultivation of internal energy or meditation goes awry, leading to mental or physical instability.\n³ *Dantian*: In traditional Chinese medicine and cultivation, the Dantian refers to an important energy center in the body, typically located in the lower abdomen.\n⁴ *Vital energy*: The Chinese term '元氣' (yuánqì) refers to the fundamental vital energy or essence within the body in traditional Chinese thought.\n⁵ *Magus*: The Chinese term '魔導士' (módǎoshì) is a common fantasy cultivation rank, usually indicating a powerful mage.\n⁶ *Sun-Rectifying Blade*: The original text used '正陽馬' (Zhengyang Ma), literally 'Sun-Rectifying Horse', which is almost certainly a typo for '正陽刀' (Zhengyang Dao - Sun-Rectifying Blade), the name of Nianbing's magic blade consistently used throughout the text. It has been corrected for readability.\n⁷ *Fish belly white*: A poetic term in Chinese, '魚肚白' (yúdùbái), referring to the pale, whitish glow in the eastern sky just before sunrise, resembling the white underside of a fish's belly.\n⁸ *Warm*: The character '㼓' (likely a typographical error) has been interpreted as 'warm' based on context, similar to '暖' (nuǎn) or '熱' (rè).\n⁹ *Warm*: The character '曖' (ài) here is likely a simplified form of '暖' (nuǎn) or a common typo for it, meaning 'warm'. This interpretation aligns with the context of comfort and closeness.\n¹⁰ *Irreconcilable with heaven*: The idiom '不共戴天' (bù gòng dài tiān) literally means 'cannot share the same sky', implying an utterly irreconcilable hatred, especially for something as grave as the murder of one's parents.\n¹¹ *Always been leading yourself*: The Chinese phrase '領先自己' (lǐngxiān zìjǐ) here could imply Nianbing has been self-reliant, pushing himself forward alone, or perhaps too focused on his own internal struggles and burdens.",

    "content": "Nian Bing was silent for a long while before saying, \"If my extremism can never change, and hatred still influences my view of the world, would you still be with me?\"\n\nFeng Nü gently rubbed against Nian Bing's shoulder, \"Since I've already chosen, I've never thought of leaving. If your heart cannot change, then after you get your revenge, I'll accompany you to find a place with beautiful mountains and clear waters, and we'll no longer interact with the outside world, living only our own lives, alright?\"\n\nNian Bing's body trembled slightly, \"Thank you, Feng Nü. I will try my best to change myself. As long as you are by my side, my heart will be much calmer. Wait for me to come back.\" With warmth in his heart, constantly recalling every word Feng Nü had said, Nian Bing left the inn. Today, he would face his group's second opponent.\n\nOn the third day of the competition, due to the unexpected incident on the first day, the Five Nations' Rising Star Magicians Tournament changed from four matches a day to two. Today's first group match was Mu Rong facing Bing Yun. Previously, Bing Yun had won two matches, and Mu Rong had won one. At least from the current situation, these two were the most likely to secure the top two spots in the group. This match was particularly important for Mu Rong; if he could defeat Thousand Illusions Bing Yun, let alone group first, he might even clinch first place in the entire competition.\n\nNian Bing and Rong Bing watched from below. No other participant, including them, favored Mu Rong. Thousand Illusions Bing Yun was not only powerful, but from her first match against Rong Bing to yesterday's match against the magician Fei Fei, the magic control she displayed was truly divine and gave people an unfathomable feeling. Relatively speaking, although Mu Rong's strength was not weak, he only believed in the strangeness of nature magic. It was almost impossible for him to win against Bing Yun.\n\nBlue light shimmered around Bing Yun's body. Her expression was still as cold as ever, without any superfluous words. Mu Rong appeared somewhat nervous. As soon as Rong Fei announced the start of the match, he immediately swung his staff, and countless vines swept towards Bing Yun, the same method he used against Fei Fei in his first match. Unfortunately, Bing Yun was not Fei Fei.\n\nA layer of frost appeared without warning, and large swathes of ice mist billowed from around Bing Yun's body. She drifted backward, disappearing into the ice mist.\n\nMu Rong secretly sneered. He thought, as long as the opponent's life exists, his nature magic could detect it. Even if he couldn't see, sensing their life aura would be enough. While controlling the vines to rush into the ice mist, he began chanting the incantation for his Nature Domain.\n\nNature magic indeed had its unique characteristics. Especially its ability to detect life was unparalleled by other magic types. As soon as the vines entered the ice mist, they immediately locked onto Bing Yun's location, surging madly towards her. However, just then, it suddenly began to snow on the competition stage. Flakes of goose-feather-like snow burst forth from the ice mist. These were not ordinary snowflakes; each one drifted through the air like a sharp blade. No matter how tough the vines were, they were still strands. The swirling snowflakes, agitated within the ice mist, caused the green vines to scatter instantly upon contact with the snowflakes.\n\nMu Rong's heart ached greatly. The Vine Staff was his treasure; with it, he had defeated many opponents of similar strength. How could he not feel distressed watching it be destroyed by the snowflakes? However, his actions did not stop. After all, the dark green gem, the core of the Vine Staff, still existed. As long as it was there, remaking a Vine Staff would not be difficult. What was most important now was to win this match.\n\nThe floating snowflakes began to spin rapidly, and a blizzard was gradually forming. Mu Rong chanted his incantation while retreating. His goal was simple: if he could just stall until his Nature Domain was cast, he would succeed. Bing Yun slowly emerged from the ice mist, a blizzard swirling around her body. A faint cold glint flickered in her eyes as she watched Mu Rong, not attacking.\n\nMu Rong looked at Bing Yun in some surprise. At this moment, his magic was finally complete. The dark green bead floated down to the ground, and its green light vanished into the earth.\n\nThousand Illusions Bing Yun said indifferently, \"If I don't let you use your most prized magic, I'm afraid you wouldn't accept defeat willingly. I want you to understand that the Nature Domain is ineffective in a world of ice.\"\n\nMu Rong snorted coldly, \"Really ineffective? My Seed of Life can reverse any negative effect. Rise, my Nature Domain!\"\n\nThe ground slowly vibrated, the earth began to subtly quake. The Seed of Life germinated within the ground, and the situation from the first day of the competition reappeared: countless green lights drifted out, coiling around every corner of the competition stage. Just then, Bing Yun moved. A blue hexagram rose from beneath her feet, instantly spreading outwards. The temperature on the competition stage dropped sharply, and the rapidly growing branches suddenly slowed their growth. Bing Yun raised both palms in front of her chest, fingertips touching, and a blue orb of light grew from small to large, gradually condensing.\n\nNian Bing, below the stage, said in surprise, \"Eighth-tier ice magic, Absolute Freeze! No wonder she was so confident.\" Absolute Freeze, in ice magic, was neither an attack nor a defense. It was like how a blizzard could be used for short-distance flight. This Absolute Freeze magic was generally used by ice magicians when they needed to hastily cross some insurmountable chasm. Under the control of spiritual power, it could condense a section of space into ice, and then one could pass over the ice's surface. The greatest advantage of this magic lay in its extreme freezing, but because the controlled distance was limited and it consumed a large amount of magic power, ice magicians rarely used it.\n\nThe blue orb of light floated into the ground. A faint blue glow instantly spread across the competition stage's surface. Everything, including the branches that had emerged from the ground and the ground itself, instantly froze. At this moment, the blizzard moved. The frozen, brittle branches were immediately cleared away under the blizzard's onslaught, turning into ice powder that drifted across the stage. The entire competition stage was completely enveloped in a blanket of ice mist.\n\nMu Rong watched the scene before him, dumbfounded. His proud Nature Domain had been broken just like that. Although he could still feel the aura of the Seed of Life, under the suppression of Absolute Freeze, unless the freeze was lifted, the Nature Domain could no longer exert its true effect. The blizzard floated to a stop in front of Mu Rong. Bing Yun calmly said, \"You should concede.\"\n\nMu Rong stared blankly at the blizzard before him. His magic power had not been completely depleted; he still had the strength to counterattack. However, would the blizzard in front of him give him time to chant an incantation?\n\nBing Yun's brow furrowed slightly. She waited no longer. The blizzard surged forward instantly, swirling around Mu Rong's body and \"sending\" him off the competition stage. The Fire Cloud Shield could only defend against magic. The blizzard disappeared after being filtered by the Fire Cloud Shield, but Mu Rong's body also fell off the stage. The first match ended so quickly. Bing Yun calmly secured her third victory. With this, her group stage matches were completely over, firmly securing the top spot in Group One.\n\nRong Bing nudged Nian Bing, whispering, \"See? Against both ice and fire magic, nature magic is greatly limited.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded slightly, a faint smile appearing in his eyes. His gaze drifted to Mu Jing beside him. Mu Jing's brow was slightly furrowed as she looked at her somewhat dejected brother, a hint of disdain in her eyes.\n\nThousand Illusions Bing Yun walked down from the stage, her cold gaze from her blue eyes falling upon Nian Bing. Nian Bing's eyes met hers. Bing Yun nodded slightly at him, then turned and walked to stand with her own group. Nian Bing was somewhat surprised in his heart. When Bing Yun looked at him, there was actually a hint of friendliness in her cold gaze. Would someone from the Ice God Pagoda be friendly towards him? Oh, that's right. After all, both he and she represented the Ice Moon Empire. Could it be that she was encouraging him to secure the top spot in Group Two?\n\n\"Third day, second match: Group Two, Participant Number One versus Group Two, Participant Number Five. Contestants, please come to the stage.\" As Rong Fei announced, Nian Bing and Mu Jing simultaneously stepped onto the stage.\n\nMu Jing was not affected by her brother's earlier defeat. She pursed her lips at Nian Bing and said, \"Are you planning to kill me today?\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment. His gaze subconsciously swept across the audience below the stage. He noticed that, apart from Bing Yun and Rong Bing, the other participants looked at him somewhat strangely. He immediately understood that their resistance was due to the ruthless hand he had shown in the first match. After his conversation with Feng Nü, the coldness in his heart had softened considerably. He smiled indifferently and retorted, \"If I beat you, will your brother rush up?\"\n\n\"You...\" Fury flared in Mu Jing's eyes, \"Do you think I'm those two useless people from that day?\"\n\nNian Bing deliberately feigned surprise and said, \"Didn't you see how your brother lost? Do you think you're much stronger than him?\"\n\nMu Jing said disdainfully, \"Then who do you think you are? Do you also come from the Ice God Pagoda or something?\"\n\nRong Fei, standing nearby, looked at Nian Bing, then at Mu Jing, and said exasperatedly, \"Are you two here to compete or to chat?\"\n\nMu Jing said, \"If you don't announce the start of the match, how are we supposed to compete?\"\n\nRong Fei snorted, then said, \"Alright, the match begins now.\" After speaking, he walked towards the edge of the stage.\n\nUpon hearing the words \"match begins now,\" Mu Jing instantly seemed like a changed person. Her dark green hair moved without wind, and her face became exceptionally calm. The aura of life naturally emanated from her, and faint green light pulsed like ripples around her body.\n\nNian Bing also moved. He extended both hands forward, each drawing a triangle in front of him. Blue and red lights intertwined to form a strange hexagram. \"Ice, you are the emblem of cold; Fire, you are the source of heat. O auras of ice and fire! Please permit me to merge your properties. Guided by your common origin, resonate!\" Blue on the left, red on the right, two colored lights rose from either side of Nian Bing's body. He finally used his most prized Ice-Fire Homology. Ice and fire magic elements continuously gathered around his body. At this moment, with Ice-Fire Homology, he could perform various magical changes. For the nature magic he was unfamiliar with, he chose to use stillness to counter movement.\n\nMu Jing's eyes completely turned into two green glows. Her body seemingly floated up from the competition stage, frighteningly so. Although it was only about a foot above the ground, at this moment, she seemed like a goddess from nature, her entire being filled with a strange aura.\n\nMu Rong below the stage muttered to himself, \"Kid, just wait for death. My sister is a Born Daughter of the Earth; how could you possibly deal with her?\"\n\nAs Nian Bing completed his incantation, Mu Jing's separated hands had already closed in front of her. Streaks of green light emanated outwards from her body as the center. Suddenly, the light in her eyes intensified. Dozens of arm-thick vines charged towards Nian Bing with a whistling sound that tore through the air. Their attack positions were very clever; they not only attacked Nian Bing but also sealed off all possible directions for him to dodge.\n\nSo fast! Nian Bing was slightly startled. He flipped his hands, directly condensing a dozen or so low-tier Ice-Fire Orbs and sent them to meet the attack. Amidst thunderous roars, explosions continuously rang out. Each one brought forth countless green fragments, and the explosive force of the Ice-Fire Orbs destroyed the vines one by one. Under the pull of the energy, Nian Bing was pushed back several steps by the shockwaves from the explosions. However, he found that Mu Jing still floated in mid-air, and all shockwaves dissipated upon reaching the green light surrounding her.\n\nNian Bing knew he couldn't wait any longer. With a flash of light, the Aotian Blade appeared in his hand. His arm instantly blurred into an illusion, and the wind blade skill inherent in the Aotian Blade conjured dozens of wind blades that drifted out, attacking Mu Jing from different angles. At the same time, the power of Ice-Fire Homology, under Nian Bing's mobilization, integrated into the Aotian Blade, and a soft hum from within nature appeared.\n\nMu Jing completely ignored the wind blades. Since her eyes had already turned into two green glows, her expression was completely unreadable at this moment. Her hands, clasped in front of her chest, remained unchanged. However, countless branches and vines had begun to sprout from the ground of the stage behind her, continuously converging and intertwining.\n\nThe wind blades touched the green aura and, like the previous shockwaves, vanished silently.\n\nThe disappearance of the wind blades didn't surprise Nian Bing much. What surprised him was the continuously growing vines and plants behind Mu Jing. That was clearly the Nature Domain that Mu Rong had used earlier, but Mu Jing hadn't chanted any incantation! How could this magic, at least equivalent to a seventh-tier spell, be used so easily?\n\nMu Jing spoke, \"Water, fire, earth, wind—all originate from nature. In my Goddess of Earth Domain, these are all ineffective. Unless the magic you cast is two tiers or more above the Goddess of Earth Domain, it might be possible to break my domain. But my Goddess of Earth Domain itself is an eighth-tier magic. Can you possess the strength of an Arch-Mage?\"",

    "content": "「就算你有，我也不會給你吟唱咒語的機會，雖然我不知道你為什麼能夠使用冰、火、風三種魔法，不過，我很欣賞你的魔法能力，現在認輸，我留給你一條活路。如果不是你所擁有的冰火同源魔法力，我也不會這麼早用出自己的領域了，這本來是留給千幻冰雲的。」\n\n  台下，冰雲眼中爆出兩團精芒，自言自語的道：「大地女神領域，是先天領域。」\n\n  站在冰雲身旁的融冰聽到了她的話不禁全身一震，下意識的問道：「真的有先天領域存在麼？」\n\n  冰雲看了融冰一眼，沒有說話，只是微微點了點頭。台上，念冰看著木晶是，有些怪異的道：「你不殺我？難道你不想為手下報仇麼？」\n\n  木晶淡然一笑，道：「不知道你是聰明還是傻，既然見到了我的大地女神領域，你覺得你那冰火同源魔法還能夠殺的死阿四麼？你也太小看我了。」\n\n  念冰眉頭微皺，道：「原來如此，不過，有件事我希望你能明白，在我的字典里從來沒有認輸二字，想獲得這場比賽的勝利，你就動手吧。」\n\n  木晶秀眉微皺，「執迷不悟，既然如此，那好吧。」綠色光影一閃，她那曼妙的嬌軀竟然退入了身後的重重藤蔓之中，藤蔓迅生了變化，竟然凝結成一個身高五丈的綠巨人。\n\n  念冰心中一凜，在比賽前他雖然已經對木晶有了很高的估計，但是，木晶所展現的實力還是大大走出了他的估計，這個不用吟唱咒語就能自然產生的領域，絕不好對付。\n\n  綠巨人動了，他那巨大的腳在比賽台上用力一跺，出一塊轟鳴，粗壯的手臂同時揮舞，上百道藤蔓激射而出。朝念冰攻來。\n\n  一道道風刃在冰火同源的作用下增幅到三階程度，如同鮮花湛放般迎向綠巨人的攻擊，但是，令念冰駭然的一幕出現了，此時地藤蔓與先前再不相同，風刃只能在藤蔓上留下淡淡的痕跡，卻並不能阻擋那近乎瘋狂的攻擊。關鍵時刻，實戰的經驗挽救了念冰，銀色的六芒星出現在他身體周圍。光影一閃。他原本所處的地方出一片密集的轟響。\n\n  木晶驚訝的聲音響起，「你還真是讓我驚訝啊!空間系魔法。」\n\n  念冰此時已經沒工夫回答了，顧不得再隱藏什麼，用嘴咬住璇璣刀地刀柄，迅收起傲天刀，雙手一振。剎那間，紅、藍兩色光芒充斥在比賽台上，冰雪女神地嘆息和火焰之神的咆哮終於出現了。\n\n  驚呼聲從台上台下響起，出驚呼的包括融飛、融極、冰雲等人，雖然只是一瞬間，但他們都認出了冰雪女神之石和火焰神之石的氣息。\n\n  坐於華天大帝身旁的融親王皺了皺眉。低聲道：「竟然是擁有先天領域的魔法師。「\n\n  綠巨人的反應很快，無數綠色的光芒鋪天蓋地朝念冰衝去，憑藉著璇璣刀自帶地短距離瞬間移動能力。\n\n  「永凍之冰魄，地獄之魔炎，我以冰火同源的掌控身份召喚你們，化為凝固的冰、凝固的炎，在極至中融合，在澎湃中釋放，沉穩的冰。狂烈的火，以你們共同地源泉為基礎，化為恆古不變的摧毀之力，毀滅一切生命吧。冰炎魔劫破。「\n\n  吟唱中的念冰並沒有停止，憑藉著千機百變的六芒。身形不斷在藤蔓的縫隙中閃爍，即使藤蔓覆蓋了整個比賽台，也不可能沒有一絲縫隙，念冰尋覓的，就是縫隙之間的機會。\n\n  幾乎每吟唱出一兩個字，他的身體就需要通過短距離瞬間轉移改變一下方位，但是，否認如何轉移，他的語調始終低沉，魔法咒語依舊繼續。\n\n  篷，當念冰吟唱出最後一個字時，他地動作遲緩了一下，頓時被一根藤蔓高高擊起，身體在空中翻滾著，但是，念冰的臉上已經流露出一絲笑容，畢竟，魔法已經完成了。\n\n  粗壯的藤蔓不會放過機會，念冰的身體被纏繞的宛如一個大粽子，只有腳下那紅藍雙色六芒星還依舊存在著。\n\n  隱沒於大地女神領域的木晶突然感覺到一陣不安，綠巨人那對巨大的拳頭在她的控制下立刻向念冰的身體轟去，但是，在這一刻已經沒有人能夠阻止傳說中的冰火同源魔法師威了。紅藍雙色六芒星的光芒突然變得無比耀眼，纏繞著念冰身體的藤蔓中亮起一藍，一紅兩點耀眼星光，冰由外向內，火由內向外，雖然在地女神領域可以吞噬一切自然的能量，但是卻無法適應兩種極端能量的碰撞。\n\n  齏粉飄然而落，念冰被高舉於空中的身體飄然下落，正好躲閃過綠巨人的致命一擊，紅色的火焰變成了凝聚的魔炎，藍色的冰芒同樣如同火焰一般波動著，紅藍兩色炎的光輝圍繞著念冰的身體旋轉上升，它們的氣息雖然完全相反，他們的能量雖然完全對立，但在這一刻，在念冰腳下那冰火同源六芒星的作用下卻顯得如此和諧。\n\n  念冰雙手分別反握冰雪女神的嘆息和火焰之神的咆哮，使冰雪女神之石和火焰神之石向外而對，奇異的一幕生了，他的眼睛竟然變成了紅、藍兩色，仰天咆哮一聲，冰與火的氣息竟然將接踵而來的藤蔓震退。\n\n  如果說，此時木晶代表著象徵自然與生命的大地女神，那麼，念冰代表的，就是摧毀一切的魔神，他在怒吼，他在咆哮。\n\n  「釋放吧，冰炎魔劫破。「龍捲並不一定是由風來形成，冰與炎融合成一股無比絢爛的風景線，帶頭紅與藍的光輝，帶頭無比霸道的氣息，會聚成直徑接近半丈的巨大冰炎龍捲，以兩顆極品寶石為原點，以念冰的冰火同源為引，爆了。它們的目標，正是綠巨人的胸膛。\n\n  所有人的目光在這一刻凝聚，就連融親王都沒有想到。在如此劣勢的情況下念冰還能出如此強悍地魔法。他用出的決不是冰魔法與炎魔法的結合，而是真正的冰火魔法，就連那咒語也是任何冰魔法和火魔法不曾擁有的。融親王想起自己對念冰的指點，眼中頓時流露出一絲微笑，心中暗想，這小子領悟的還真快啊!\n\n  轟----，在劇烈的爆炸聲中，由一百名大魔法師構成的火雲罩劇烈地顫抖起來，眾魔法師不得不施加咒語以穩定結界。比賽台上那無比巨大地綠巨人身體完全停止。而念冰出的冰炎魔劫破仿佛融入了他的身體一般消失不見。\n\n  念冰站在地上。腦海中一陣眩暈，那二十三次廁所對他的身體還是有著不小的影響，此時用出這麼大的魔法後，精神力的消耗帶動體力有些吃不消了，但是，他知道自己還不能放鬆，一邊大口大口地呼吸著。一邊凝聚著魔法力。\n\n  綠巨人的身體仿佛凝固了一般，站在那裡一動不動，組成身體的藤蔓此時更像是岩石，高達五丈的身軀寂靜的站在那裡。\n\n  「不，這不可能，你不可能破了我的大地女神領域。「木晶地聲音從比賽台四面八方用起來。聲音中充滿了不甘。\n\n  就在此時，一道道裂痕開始出現在綠巨人胸前，裂痕不斷的延伸著不斷拓寬著，無數裂痕的分支幾乎是幾次眨眼的工夫就已經蔓延到綠巨人身上的每一個角落處，此時此刻，每個人心中都升起兩個字，崩潰。\n\n  紅、藍兩色光芒圍繞著念冰的身體旋轉著，念冰謹慎的注視著那凝固不同的綠巨人快調集著體內的魔法力同時收回了璇璣刀。\n\n  綠巨人身上不斷出現地裂痕中漸漸亮起光芒。那是紅與藍的光澤，喀喀的破碎聲逐漸響起，綠巨人的身體開始剝落，化為一片片齏粉飄落。\n\n  轟----，火罩再次劇烈的震盪一下。整個綠巨人在瞬間完全崩潰，比賽台上原本強大地生命氣息隨之傾覆，一切都恢復了正常。\n\n  木晶臉色有些蒼白的出現在念冰前方七丈外，她眼中充滿了不甘，「你是怎麼做到的？我的大地女神領域明明可以吞噬你出的一切能量。「\n\n  念冰淡然一笑，道：「不錯，你這個領域非常神奇，任何屬於自然氣息的魔法元素都會被它所吞噬。但是，先前你也曾經說過，如果我出手攻擊能夠過你這個領域兩階以上，就可以將它完全毀滅。當然，我還沒有魔導師的實力，單一釋放魔法的話，也只能出八階的攻擊力，但是，你的魔法雖然神奇，我的冰火同源魔法力同樣有著自己的特點，，或許你應該感到榮幸，冰極魔劫破我研究出後還是第一次使用。這是一個以冰火為基礎的融合魔法，揮出的威力已經達到了魔導士的極限九階，冰與火，單一放出來，都屬於自然魔法的領域，但是，冰火同源卻已經過這個領域，兩種極端的能量同時出現，冰的寒冷與火的灼熱同時迸，侵入你的大地女神領域，雖然威力不到十階，但對自然氣息的破壞力卻可以與十階比擬，所以，你的領域完蛋了，這樣詳細的能讓你滿意麼？「\n\n  木晶俏臉上流露出一絲苦澀的笑容，噴出一口鮮血，慘然道：「好，好，冰火同源，極端的碰撞，我輸了。「大地女神領域與木晶是一體的，領域被破，否認是精神力還是身體，她都受到了不輕的傷害，雖然魔法力還存在著，但她已經沒有調動魔法力戰鬥的能力了。\n\n  念冰臉上流露出一絲誠懇的微笑，木晶的實力得到了他的尊重，「坦白說，這場比賽我勝的很險，這畢竟是比賽台上，周圍又有火雲罩形成的結界，使你的大地女神領域無法揮出最大的威力，否則，我很難破掉它。而且，一上來你並沒有直接向我動攻擊，如果我猜的不錯，在大地女神領域之中，你可以將自己的自然魔法揮到極限，如果是那樣的話，我們之間的勝負還很難說。「\n\n  木晶眼中流露出一絲驚訝，面前的念冰似乎不是那麼討厭了，看了一眼他手中的冰火雙刀，道：」我想，我們還會有機會再見的，到那裡，再分出勝負好了。我不是一個輸不起的人，你能夠使用四種魔法，大地女神領域很難完全控制你，全力相拼，我們也不過是五五之數。「\n\n  念冰下意識的點了點頭，他心中對木晶這怪異的領域極感興趣，但此時比賽已經結束，他敢不好問的太多，融飛此時已經走到比賽台中央，「你們的比賽還需要繼續麼？」他嘴裡雖然問著，但目光卻落在念冰手中的正陽刀上。\n\n  木晶搖了搖頭，道：「我認輸。念冰，我現在已經動不了了，能不能麻煩你扶我下去。」\n\n  念冰看也不看融飛，將手中刀收入空間之戒，幾步走到木晶面前，他沒有伸手去攙扶木晶，腳下的冰火六芒星亮了起來，口中念動著低沉的咒語，左手手腕一翻，巨大的聖耀刀出現在掌握之中，抬起另一隻手向身前的木晶按去。\n\n  「混蛋，你幹什麼？「台下的木榮以為念冰要向木晶下殺手，飛快的朝比賽台跑來，但是，他是魔法師，奔跑的度怎麼比的上念冰落手快呢？木晶同樣驚訝的看著念冰，各種複雜的念頭從腦海中一閃而過，就在這時，淡淡的金色光芒在念冰手上凝聚，聖耀刀上散出耀眼的光芒，通過冰火同源六芒星的轉換，不斷將光明的氣息輸入念冰體內，淡金色的光芒在木榮蹬上比賽台時籠罩了木晶的身體。\n\n---\n\n\"Even if you have them, I won't give you a chance to chant spells. Although I don't know why you can use Ice, Fire, and Wind magic, I truly admire your magical abilities. Surrender now, and I will spare your life. If it weren't for the Ice-Fire Homologous Magic Power you possess, I wouldn't have used my domain so early. This was originally reserved for Qianhuan Bingyun.\"\n\nBelow the stage, two glints of light burst forth in Bingyun's eyes as he muttered to himself, \"Earth Goddess Domain, it's an Innate Domain.\"\n\nRongbing, standing beside Bingyun, couldn't help but tremble when he heard her words, and instinctively asked, \"Do Innate Domains really exist?\"\n\nBingyun glanced at Rongbing, said nothing, but merely nodded slightly. On the stage, Nianbing looked at Mujing, speaking somewhat strangely, \"You won't kill me? Don't you want to avenge your subordinates?\"\n\nMujing smiled faintly, saying, \"I don't know if you're smart or foolish. Now that you've seen my Earth Goddess Domain, do you think your Ice-Fire Homologous Magic can still kill Asi? You underestimate me too much.\"\n\nNianbing's brow furrowed slightly as he said, \"So that's how it is. However, there's something I hope you understand: in my dictionary, there are no two words 'surrender.' If you want to win this match, then make your move.\"\n\nMujing's delicate brows furrowed slightly. \"So stubborn. In that case, fine.\" A green light flickered, and her graceful body actually retreated into the dense vines behind her. The vines quickly transformed, condensing into a Green Giant five *zhang* tall.\n\nNianbing's heart tensed. Although he had already estimated Mujing's strength highly before the match, the power Mujing displayed still far exceeded his expectations. This domain, which could naturally manifest without chanting spells, would definitely not be easy to deal with.\n\nThe Green Giant moved. Its massive foot stomped hard on the competition stage, letting out a roar. Its thick arms simultaneously swung, and hundreds of vines shot out, attacking Nianbing.\n\nWind Blades, amplified to third-tier by the Ice-Fire Homologous effect, met the Green Giant's attack like blooming flowers. However, a scene that horrified Nianbing appeared: the vines at this moment were completely different from before. The Wind Blades could only leave faint marks on the vines and could not stop the almost frenzied assault. At the critical moment, his combat experience saved Nianbing. A silver hexagram appeared around his body. With a flash of light, a dense series of thuds sounded where he had originally stood.\n\nMujing's surprised voice rang out, \"You truly surprise me! Spatial Magic.\"\n\nNianbing had no time to answer now. Disregarding any further concealment, he bit down on the Xuanji Saber's hilt with his mouth, swiftly put away the Aotian Saber, and shook both hands. In an instant, red and blue lights filled the competition stage, and the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Flame God finally appeared.\n\nGasps of surprise rose from both on and off the stage. Those exclaiming included Rongfei, Rongji, Bingyun, and others. Although it was only for an instant, they all recognized the aura of the Ice Goddess Stone and the Flame God Stone.\n\nPrince Rong, seated beside Emperor Huatian, frowned. He whispered, \"He's actually a mage with an Innate Domain.\"\n\nThe Green Giant reacted quickly. Countless green lights surged towards Nianbing, overwhelming him, as he relied on the Xuanji Saber's innate short-distance instantaneous movement ability.\n\n\"Eternal Frost Ice Soul, Infernal Demon Flame, I, as the master of Ice-Fire Homologous, summon you! Transform into solidified ice, solidified flame; merge in the extreme, release in the surge! Steady ice. Raging fire, based on your shared source, transform into an eternal power of destruction! Destroy all life! Ice Flame Demon Calamity Rupture!\"\n\nNianbing did not stop chanting. Relying on the Thousand-Mechanism Ever-Changing Hexagram, his figure continuously flickered through the gaps in the vines. Even if the vines covered the entire stage, there could not be absolutely no gaps, and Nianbing sought out the opportunities between these gaps.\n\nAlmost every one or two words he chanted, his body needed to change position via short-distance instantaneous transfers. However, no matter how he shifted, his tone remained low, and the magic incantation continued.\n\n*Peng!* When Nianbing chanted the last word, his movement slowed for an instant. He was immediately struck high into the air by a vine, his body tumbling. However, a smile had already appeared on Nianbing's face; after all, the magic was complete.\n\nThe thick vines would not miss the opportunity. Nianbing's body was wrapped tightly like a large *zongzi*, with only the red and blue hexagram beneath his feet still visible.\n\nMujing, hidden within the Earth Goddess Domain, suddenly felt a wave of unease. Under her control, the Green Giant's massive fists immediately slammed towards Nianbing's body. However, at this moment, no one could stop the legendary Ice-Fire Homologous Mage's might. The light from the red and blue hexagram suddenly became incomparably dazzling. Within the vines wrapped around Nianbing's body, two points of dazzling starlight, one blue and one red, lit up. Ice from outside inwards, fire from inside outwards. Although the Earth Goddess Domain could devour all natural energy, it could not adapt to the collision of two extreme energies.\n\nPulverized dust drifted down. Nianbing's body, which had been hoisted into the air, floated gently downwards, precisely dodging the Green Giant's fatal blow. The red flames transformed into condensed demon flames, and the blue ice light also undulated like flames. The red and blue gleam of the flames revolved and ascended around Nianbing's body. Although their auras were completely opposite, and their energies entirely contradictory, at this moment, under the influence of the Ice-Fire Homologous hexagram beneath Nianbing's feet, they appeared incredibly harmonious.\n\nNianbing's hands each held the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Flame God in reverse grip, positioning the Ice Goddess Stone and the Flame God Stone facing outwards. A strange scene occurred: his eyes actually turned red and blue. He let out a roar towards the sky, and the aura of ice and fire actually repelled the advancing vines.\n\nIf, at this moment, Mujing represented the Earth Goddess, symbolizing nature and life, then Nianbing represented the Demon God of destruction, roaring and raging.\n\n\"Release, Ice Flame Demon Calamity Rupture!\" A tornado is not necessarily formed by wind. Ice and flame merged into an incomparably splendid sight, leading with red and blue radiance, carrying an overwhelmingly dominant aura. They converged into a massive Ice Flame Tornado, nearly half a *zhang* in diameter, taking the two supreme gems as its origin and Nianbing's Ice-Fire Homologous as its guide. It erupted. Its target was precisely the Green Giant's chest.\n\nEveryone's gaze converged at this moment; even Prince Rong had not anticipated it. Under such a disadvantageous situation, Nianbing could still unleash such powerful magic. What he used was absolutely not a combination of ice magic and fire magic, but true ice-fire magic. Even the incantation was unlike any ice magic or fire magic had ever possessed. Prince Rong recalled his guidance to Nianbing, and a smile immediately appeared in his eyes as he thought to himself, \"This kid truly comprehends quickly!\"\n\n*Boom!* Amidst a violent explosion, the Fire Cloud Barrier, formed by one hundred Archmages, trembled violently. The mages had to cast spells to stabilize the barrier. On the competition stage, the Green Giant's incomparably massive body came to a complete stop. And the Ice Flame Demon Calamity Rupture Nianbing unleashed seemed to have merged into its body, vanishing from sight.\n\nNianbing stood on the ground. A wave of dizziness swept through his mind. Those twenty-three trips to the restroom still had a considerable effect on his body. After using such a powerful magic, the consumption of his mental power was making his physical strength unable to cope. However, he knew he couldn't relax yet, and while taking deep breaths, he simultaneously gathered his magic power.\n\nThe Green Giant's body seemed to have solidified, standing motionless. The vines that formed its body now resembled rock, and the five-*zhang*-tall figure stood silently.\n\n\"No, this is impossible, you couldn't have broken my Earth Goddess Domain!\" Mujing's voice echoed from all directions of the competition stage, filled with unwillingness.\n\nJust then, cracks began to appear on the Green Giant's chest. The cracks continuously extended and widened, and countless branches of these cracks spread to every corner of the Green Giant's body in a matter of blinks. At this moment, two words rose in everyone's minds: collapse.\n\nRed and blue lights revolved around Nianbing's body. Nianbing cautiously watched the unmoving Green Giant, quickly gathering the magic power within his body while simultaneously retracting the Xuanji Saber.\n\nLight gradually began to shine from the cracks continuously appearing on the Green Giant's body. It was the glow of red and blue. Cracking and shattering sounds gradually began to ring out, and the Green Giant's body began to peel away, turning into flakes of pulverized dust that drifted down.\n\n*Boom!* The Fire Cloud Barrier vibrated violently again. The entire Green Giant collapsed completely in an instant, and the powerful life aura that had originally permeated the competition stage dissipated with it. Everything returned to normal.\n\nMujing appeared seven *zhang* ahead of Nianbing, her face somewhat pale. Her eyes were filled with unwillingness. \"How did you do that? My Earth Goddess Domain clearly can devour all energy you unleash.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly, saying, \"Indeed, your domain is quite miraculous. Any magic element belonging to natural aura will be devoured by it. However, you also said earlier that if my attack could exceed your domain by two tiers or more, it could be completely destroyed. Of course, I don't have the strength of an Archmage yet; if I release a single magic, I can only unleash an eighth-tier attack power. But while your magic is miraculous, my Ice-Fire Homologous Magic Power also has its own unique characteristics. Perhaps you should feel honored; this is the first time I've used the Ice Extreme Demon Calamity Rupture* since I developed it. This is a fusion magic based on ice and fire, and the power it unleashes has reached the ninth-tier limit of a Mage. Ice and fire, when released individually, both belong to the realm of natural magic. However, Ice-Fire Homologous has already surpassed this realm. Two extreme energies appear simultaneously: the coldness of ice and the scorching heat of fire erupt at the same time, invading your Earth Goddess Domain. Although the power doesn't reach the tenth-tier, its destructive power against natural auras can rival the tenth-tier. So, your domain is finished. Is this detailed explanation satisfactory to you?\"\n\nA bitter smile appeared on Mujing's pretty face, and she spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, saying miserably, \"Good, good, Ice-Fire Homologous, an extreme collision, I lost.\" The Earth Goddess Domain was one with Mujing. With her domain broken, whether it was her mental power or her physical body, she had suffered no light injuries. Although her magic power still existed, she no longer had the ability to mobilize it for combat.\n\nA sincere smile appeared on Nianbing's face; Mujing's strength had earned his respect. \"To be frank, I won this match by a very narrow margin. After all, this is a competition stage, surrounded by a barrier formed by the Fire Cloud Barrier, which prevented your Earth Goddess Domain from unleashing its maximum power. Otherwise, it would have been very difficult for me to break it. Moreover, you didn't directly attack me at the start. If I'm not mistaken, within the Earth Goddess Domain, you can unleash your natural magic to its limit. If that were the case, the outcome between us would still be very hard to say.\"\n\nA hint of surprise appeared in Mujing's eyes. Nianbing, before her, no longer seemed so detestable. She glanced at the ice-fire dual sabers in his hands and said, \"I think we'll have another chance to meet. We can decide the victor then. I'm not a bad loser. You can use four types of magic. The Earth Goddess Domain would have a hard time fully controlling you. If we had gone all out against each other, it would still have been a fifty-fifty chance.\"\n\nNianbing unconsciously nodded. His heart was extremely interested in Mujing's peculiar domain, but the match was over, and he didn't dare ask too many questions. Rongfei had now walked to the center of the competition stage. \"Do your matches still need to continue?\" Although he asked the question, his gaze was fixed on the Zhengyang Saber in Nianbing's hand.\n\nMujing shook her head, saying, \"I surrender. Nianbing, I can't move now. Could I trouble you to help me down?\"\n\nNianbing didn't even look at Rongfei. He put his sabers into his Spatial Ring, walked a few steps to Mujing, and did not reach out to help her. The ice-fire hexagram beneath his feet lit up, and he chanted a low incantation. With a flick of his left wrist, the massive Holy Radiance Saber appeared in his grasp, and he raised his other hand, pressing it towards Mujing in front of him.\n\n\"Bastard, what are you doing?\" Murong, below the stage, thought Nianbing was going to deliver a killing blow to Mujing and quickly ran towards the competition stage. But he was a mage; how could his running speed compare to how fast Nianbing moved his hand? Mujing also looked at Nianbing in surprise, various complex thoughts flashing through her mind. Just then, a faint golden light condensed in Nianbing's hand. The Holy Radiance Saber emitted a dazzling glow, and through the conversion of the Ice-Fire Homologous hexagram, it continuously channeled Light aura into Nianbing's body. The faint golden light enveloped Mujing's body just as Murong stepped onto the competition stage.\n\n---\n\n*Translator's note: The name of this magic was previously referred to as \"Ice Flame Demon Calamity Rupture\" (冰炎魔劫破) during the chanting. While the characters are slightly different here (冰極魔劫破, \"Ice Extreme Demon Calamity Rupture\"), it appears to refer to the same ice-fire based fusion magic discussed.",

    "content": "Rong Fei did not stop Nie Bing's actions, because before the competition, Prince Rong had told him not to interfere no matter what means Nie Bing used during the competition.\n\nMu Rong stopped, looking at Nie Bing in surprise. At this moment, Mu Jing had already closed her eyes, a gentle and serene aura emanating from her pretty face. Bathed in light, her originally pale complexion gradually gained a flush. The Fifth-level Light Healing Magic continuously nourished Mu Jing's body. Nie Bing put away the Sacred Radiance Blade, extended his other hand, and placed it on Mu Jing's forehead. The aura of ice appeared, but this time it wasn't cold ice. With the help of fire, the ice transformed into gentle water, following closely after the light, swirling around Mu Jing's body.\n\nMu Jing opened her eyes, her beautiful eyes filled with surprise. \"My domain seems to have recovered. How is it so fast?\"\n\nNie Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Light is the catalyst for all life, and also a supplement for your Nature Magic. And water is the source of life. Through the nourishment of light and water, what's impossible about recovery?\"\n\nMu Jing showed a wry smile. \"Light, what a light! This is already the fifth type of magic you've cast. Don't tell me you're an all-elemental mage; that's too incredible.\"\n\nNie Bing shook his head and said, \"No, I'm not an all-elemental mage, at least not yet. All right, I think you can walk down by yourself now.\"\n\nMu Jing's body had completely recovered with the help of the two healing magics, and she was fine apart from weakened mental energy. The two walked down from the competition stage together. When Nie Bing passed by Mu Rong, Mu Rong's expression was very complex, showing confusion, surprise, astonishment, and admiration.\n\nThe third day of the Prodigy Mages' Tournament thus concluded. However, it wasn't over. Almost everyone's gaze fell upon Nie Bing, for possessing a treasure makes one a target. Nie Bing had successively displayed five magic blades, and when using magic, their immediate aura could not be suppressed. Who could resist the temptation brought by top-tier magic gems? Especially the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the God of Fire, which drew intense attention from the Rong family and Qianhuan Bingyun.\n\nAfter Emperor Hanhua Tian announced a reward of one hundred purple gold coins for the winner, Rong Fei said, \"Today's competition ends here. It will continue tomorrow. Mage Nie Bing, please stay for a moment. Everyone else may leave.\"\n\nBingyun glanced at Nie Bing, then turned and left first. Mu Jing gave Nie Bing a slight smile, then left with Mu Rong. Other mages also departed one after another. Only Nie Bing, Rong Bing, and Rong Ji remained.\n\nEmperor Huatian stood up from his seat. The God of Fire Stone was once Prince Rong's most treasured possession. How could he not recognize it? He patted Prince Rong's shoulder and said, \"Old Rong, you handle this matter. No matter what you decide, I have no objection.\" After speaking, he left with his officials from the other side of the Trial Hall. His meaning was clear: even if Prince Rong killed Nie Bing to retrieve the God of Fire Stone, there would be nothing wrong with it, and he would not interfere. Huatian was not afraid of offending the Ice Moon Empire. Moreover, Nie Bing only represented the Ice Moon Empire Mages' Guild.\n\nOne hundred great fire mages also exited the Trial Hall at Rong Fei's signal. Only a few people remained in the vast Trial Hall. Prince Rong slowly walked from the side of the competition stage to Nie Bing and his companions. Rong Fei also stepped down from the stage. Nie Bing calmly looked at them, showing no expression. Rong Bing was equally restless. Prince Rong had known for a long time that Nie Bing possessed the God of Fire Stone; even if Nie Bing didn't use it today, he would eventually use it in subsequent competitions.\n\nRong Fei looked at Nie Bing and said, \"Where did you get your God of Fire Stone?\" His tone was very impolite. After all, the God of Fire Stone was the Rong family's ancestral treasure. Its sudden appearance in an outsider's hands, if not for the prior competition and the presence of Emperor Huatian, he would have already erupted. Now, he had no more qualms.\n\nNie Bing calmly said, \"I am representing the Ice Moon Empire in this competition. Is it necessary to answer your question?\"\n\nA cold glint flashed in Rong Fei's eyes. \"Don't forget, this is the Huarong Empire. Although your magic has many strange aspects, it's still not worth my attention.\"\n\nNie Bing said nothing, merely turning his gaze towards Prince Rong. Prince Rong raised his hand, stopping Rong Fei from speaking further. He calmly said, \"Nie Bing, come with me. A-Fei, Ji'er, you are not to speak of today's events, especially not to let it spread within the family. Otherwise, you will bear the consequences yourselves.\"\n\nRong Fei was stunned. He naturally hadn't expected Prince Rong to react this way. He urgently said, \"Big Brother, he has the God of Fire Stone!\"\n\nPrince Rong glared at him. \"I'm not so old and muddle-headed yet that I can't see what you see. No more talk, come find me tonight.\"\n\nIf there was anyone who could make the fire archmage Rong Fei afraid, it was only his elder brother. From childhood, Rong Yan's position in the Rong family was unshakeable. Sighing, Rong Fei lowered his head and said nothing more. Prince Rong turned and walked out of the hall. Nie Bing also had something he wanted to ask him, so he followed him, leaving the Trial Hall.\n\nWatching their retreating figures, Rong Fei's brows furrowed deeply. He muttered to himself, \"The God of Fire Stone vanished without a trace after Tian'er took it from the Rong family. How did it suddenly reappear? Could this boy named Nie Bing be related to Rong Tian? Nie Bing, Nie Bing... Ah! I remember now. Wasn't the bastard born to Rong Tian and that little vixen from the Ice God Pagoda named Nie Bing? Could it be...\"\n\nRong Bing, standing nearby, immediately flared up in anger. She unceremoniously said, \"Third Grandfather, what do you mean by 'bastard'? Nie Bing is Uncle Tian's son, and also a member of our Rong family. How can you call him a bastard?\"\n\nRong Fei raised his head, a glint flashing in his eyes. \"Bing'er, I see you're very close to that boy. Have you known his identity all along?\"\n\nRong Bing calmly said, \"You should ask Grandfather about these matters, Third Grandfather. I'm a bit tired, I'll head back first.\" After speaking, she turned and walked towards the hall exit.\n\n\"Wait a moment, I'll walk with you.\" Rong Ji called out to Rong Bing and strode to catch up. Just before the two were about to exit the Trial Hall, Rong Ji turned back to Rong Fei and said, \"Third Grandfather, if that Nie Bing really is Uncle Tian's son, then he's not a bastard.\" With that, the two walked out of the Trial Hall.\n\nRong Fei stood inside the Trial Hall. He wasn't surprised by Rong Bing's attitude, as Rong Bing's father, Rong Yue, and Nie Bing's father, Zhan Tian, were twin brothers. However, Rong Ji's reaction greatly surprised him. Rong Ji was the most outstanding disciple of his and his second brother's branch. How could he favor an outsider over his own?¹ That boy Nie Bing's magic was so strange. If Big Brother truly acknowledged his identity, then in the competition for the next generation, his and his second brother's lineage would have no chance whatsoever. No, he had to quickly go back and discuss this with his second brother. Thinking this, Rong Fei strode out of the Trial Hall.\n\nNie Bing followed Prince Rong to a quiet room in the Imperial Palace. Prince Rong sat down on a seat. He pointed to a chair beside him and said, \"You sit too.\"\n\nNie Bing calmly sat down beside him. Due to his physical weakness and the intense concentration during the previous battle, he indeed felt somewhat tired. \"You know everything about me, why did you call me here?\"\n\nPrince Rong calmly said, \"Boy, don't you think you're too ostentatious? Today, your performance garnered everyone's attention, including Huatian and Su Yue. Anyone would likely covet the magic gems embedded in your five top-tier magic blades. How do you plan to handle it? Perhaps there's nothing now, but after the competition ends, anything could happen.\"\n\nNie Bing looked at Prince Rong. After Prince Rong presented the Everlasting Blade as a prize and after the comforting words from Rong Bing and Feng Nü, the hatred in his heart had greatly diminished. Only his immense hatred for the Ice God Pagoda remained strong. The person before him, after all, was his biological grandfather! \"Then what do you think I should do? There will naturally be variables, but I don't think it would be difficult for me to leave Dutian City.\"\n\nA rare smile appeared on Prince Rong's face. \"Are you going to use your resemblance to Rong Bing? That is indeed a method, but it can only secure your safety temporarily. Once the matter is exposed, not only will outsiders not let you go, but many within the Rong family itself will want to put you to death.\"\n\nNie Bing looked at Prince Rong with some surprise. \"Since you know about the internal conflicts within the family, why haven't you dealt with them sooner? Otherwise, the Rong family will surely fall into chaos in the future.\"\n\nA profound light gleamed in Prince Rong's eyes as he leaned back in his chair. \"What you can see, I naturally can see too. The reason I haven't interfered is because I don't want the Rong family to decline. The Rong family is very glorious now, but that doesn't mean it can remain glorious forever. One day, when Huatian is gone and I am gone, everything will change. Ever since the Huarong Empire gradually grew stronger, the Rong family has been at the peak of power. It can be said that all the empire's armies are under my control. In contrast, Su Yue has been much more low-key; although he is the Imperial Chancellor, he has rarely taken the initiative to appear in public these past years. Su Yue is the smartest person I've ever met, and a clever person's actions naturally have their reasons. Do you understand what it means for the tallest tree in the forest to be the first to be felled by the wind?² There are too many eyes watching the Rong family. The greater the Rong family's power, the closer it is to collapse. Once I am gone, the Rong family will surely face a disaster.\"\n\nNie Bing's mind raced. What he didn't understand was why Prince Rong would tell him all this. \"What you're saying, how is it related to the Rong family's current internal conflicts?\"\n\nPrince Rong said, \"Of course it's related. In my heart, there has never been such a thing as 'ordinary'. Conflict is not a bad thing. Whether it's internal strife or external conflict, how can one contend without strength? The family is currently divided into two factions, but their strength is well-balanced. To find a way to overcome the other, they will inevitably strive to continuously improve their own strength. Even if one day the Rong family splits or faces pressure from various sides, as long as their strength is sufficient, what does a divided Rong family matter? After all, no matter which side, they are still named Rong. Do you understand what I mean?\"\n\nNie Bing trembled, looking at Prince Rong before him with some alarm. He had spoken so clearly that Nie Bing would be a fool not to understand. \"But...\"\n\nPrince Rong stopped him from continuing. \"There are no 'buts.' What I have decided will not change. Whether you admit it or not, my blood flows in you. You don't need to get involved in the Rong family's affairs; as long as I am still here, nothing will happen. However, for the future of the Rong family, I want you to agree to one condition: I hope you can become a deterrent like the Ice Goddess's Priest, becoming a true powerhouse on the Yangguang Continent. That way, no matter what happens to the Rong family in the future, anyone who mentions the name 'Rong' will have reservations.\"\n\nHearing Prince Rong's words, Nie Bing's mood instead calmed. \"Becoming a powerhouse on the continent has always been my goal; even if you didn't say it, I would strive to do it. But why should I serve the Rong family? Who am I to the Rong family? I am merely an outsider. What has the Rong family given me since childhood? It's already good enough that I don't seek revenge against the Rong family. What right do I have to help them?\"\n\nA brilliant light burst forth in Prince Rong's eyes. \"What has the Rong family given you? Is 'life' not enough? Without the Rong family, would your father exist? Without your father, did you spring from the earth? Even if the Rong family has wronged you and your father, the Rong family gave you life. I know you're unconvinced, and your resentment runs deep; I could see it from your performance on the first day of the competition. My request for you to help the Rong family is naturally not unconditional. There are a few things I can promise you: First, as long as you agree to my condition, while I won't use the Rong family's power to support you, I myself will fully help you reach the pinnacle of the path of magic. At the same time, I can also promise you that no matter what happens to the Rong family in the future, the lineage of Rong Yue and Rong Bing will inevitably be the mainstream of the Rong family; you only need to protect that lineage. I think you should know that after your father took you and the God of Fire Stone and left, he was disowned by the Rong family. Your father was a man who always valued honor greatly; in this aspect, you are not like him. At the very least, no matter when, he was proud to be a member of the Rong family. Although he is gone, if he were aware in the afterlife that he could return to the Rong family's genealogy, I believe he would be very happy. As a son, do you not want to help your father fulfill his wish?\"\n\n---\n¹ Literally \"elbow bends outward,\" meaning to favor an outsider over one's own kin or faction.\n² Literally \"the tallest tree in the forest will be felled by the wind,\" an idiom meaning that those who stand out or are too prominent will attract trouble or be targeted.",

    "content": "Nian Bing's heart stirred. From the age of six, when he followed his father away from the Rong family, until their separation at ten, he had clearly observed that whenever his father mentioned the Rong family, his expression would turn bleak. Leaving the Rong family was out of necessity. However, his father had always told him that if there was an opportunity in the future to bring honor to the Rong family, he would definitely return. Prince Rong understood his son very well; every condition he mentioned was exactly what Nian Bing deeply desired. But, should he really agree to protect the Rong family from then on? Once he agreed, it would be tantamount to admitting he was a Rong family descendant.\n\nLooking at the hesitant Nian Bing, Prince Rong said calmly: \"I've lived for almost ninety years. Life, to me, is just a form of existence. I've long since seen through it. I have many children in my life, but only two are truly outstanding: your father and Rong Yue. Rong Yue possesses great talent and strategic vision, and he knows how to conceal his brilliance. From every angle, he is my ideal successor. He has long-term vision; not only has he secretly developed his strength, but he has also nurtured an outstanding son. Other than letting your father go back then, he has never disappointed me. Compared to Rong Yue, your father was far inferior in these aspects. But, do you know? He was most like my younger self. He was too easily swayed by emotions. If he had even half of Rong Yue's rationality, he would never have chosen to marry your mother back then. When Rong Tian and Rong Yue were ten, I already discerned their characters. From a selfish perspective, I wished to pass the Rong family on to Rong Tian. Seeing him was like seeing my younger self. Your grandmother, the mother of Rong Tian and Rong Yue, was only twenty when she died. At that time, Rong Yue and his brother were just two years old. Your grandmother died in war. It was that grief and indignation at the time that prompted me to ally with Hua Tian and Su Yue, leading to the founding of the current Hua Rong Empire. But. After everything calmed down, looking back, what did I gain? The hatred and regret in my heart still remain. Power, to me, is merely fleeting clouds. Who could know the loneliness in my heart? I strongly opposed your parents' marriage precisely because I didn't want your father to follow in my footsteps. Facts proved me right; their union brought only pain. After your mother was taken back by the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, I was deeply disappointed in your father. Watching his despondent state, I wished I could have molded iron into steel!¹ The greater the expectation, the greater the disappointment. He ultimately walked my path. Family matters are inherently difficult to explain. It's normal for you to hate me, to hate the Rong family. After all, your life experiences since childhood are far beyond anything Rong Bing and the others can compare to. I also know you've endured much hardship. But, one's eyes must look forward; don't look back at the past. I have my own arrangements for your father's matter. While hatred can be a driving force for your progress, it can also simultaneously become an obstacle to your progress. You must clearly understand this point. Managing the intensity of your hatred well is crucial for your future development. After I've arranged matters here with the Rong family, I will make a trip to the Ice God Tower. You can come with me then.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart was in turmoil, various complex and chaotic emotions continuously churned within him. \"You're going to the Ice God Tower?\"\n\nPrince Rong glanced at him and said, \"My son is dead. If I, the old man, don't step forward, then my nickname, 'Flame Lion King,' would be for naught.² A year after the competition here ends, come back to the Rong family to find me. I'll take you with me to the Ice God Tower. I've said it before, death isn't frightening. As early as the year your grandmother passed away, I had already come to terms with death. Yet, unexpectedly, I've still lived to such an old age. To die at the hands of one's greatest lifelong adversary might not be an unfortunate thing. I hope the battles between Divine Descendants will help you understand some things.\"\n\nNian Bing lowered his head, staring blankly at the ground. Prince Rong did not disturb him, merely watching him quietly, awaiting his decision.\n\nAfter a long while, Nian Bing raised his head, his eyes already bloodshot. \"Alright, I agree to your conditions.... Grandfather.\" The last two words came out a bit haltingly, but they represented his resolve.\n\n\"Hahahaha.\" Prince Rong burst into laughter, tilting his head back, the sound waves making the windowpanes tremble slightly. \"Good, good, good. I didn't misjudge you. One day, you are bound to surpass me.\"\n\nAfter Nian Bing uttered the word 'Grandfather,' it signified that he had once again acknowledged his identity as a Rong family descendant. Watching the joyous Prince Rong, Nian Bing's chaotic heart gradually calmed. \"Can life and death truly be regarded so lightly?\" He voiced the doubt in his heart.\n\nThe laughter subsided. \"What is life? And what is death? As long as one dies with value, what does death matter? If my death can bring the Rong family a new guardian, then it is well worth it.\" A joyful gleam shone in Prince Rong's eyes, \"Perhaps you're wondering why I chose you. Actually, your being Rong Tian's son is only one reason. More importantly, it's your talent in magic. That day, your battle with me showed me your future, and also the Rong family's hope. That's why I presented these conditions. I deeply believe my judgment is not mistaken. Although everything in the future seems somewhat distant now, a few decades in life pass in the blink of an eye. Alright, I've finished what I had to say. Now, it's your turn. I imagine you have many questions about today's competition. Ask away; anything I know, I will tell you without reservation. This is for you.\" A red jade stone was tossed to Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing took it and saw it was a lion carved from high-grade red jade. Fiery red light swirled around it, as if flames were rising within the jade itself. Prince Rong said, \"With this, you can freely enter and exit every corner of the Rong Manor. No one will dare to stop you. It represents me.\" What Prince Rong didn't say was that this red jade lion, imbued with magical aura, was also the token of the Rong family head.\n\nNian Bing silently put the red jade lion into his spatial ring, took a deep breath, and calmed his agitated emotions. He said, \"Grandfather, I'd like to know what was going on with Mu Jing's domains today.\"\n\nPrince Rong smiled slightly and said, \"I knew you'd ask about this. A domain, in its original meaning, is a zone created by a magician that is most suitable for them to cast spells, or it can be said to be the range covered by magic. Depending on the characteristics of the domain a magician casts, it can be divided into many types. Domains are generally activated by magic, so it can also be considered a special kind of magic. Like Mu Rong from the Langmu Empire, his Nature Domain belongs to this category. To put it more simply, you can think of a domain as a magic array cast through a magic incantation. Within this magic array, a magician's strength will significantly increase. Domains are generally divided into three categories: one is illusionary domains; the second is offensive domains; and the third is amplification domains. The domain Mu Rong cast belongs to the second type, an offensive domain, which incorporates the characteristics of Nature Magic and is especially effective against Light and Water-element magicians. Although this domain's power is decent, his application of it isn't mature enough. If his magic power could reach the level of a Mage-god, its power would greatly increase. As for the girl from Ice God Tower, her domain is much more formidable. From an essential perspective, it's a clever combination of three types of domains, encompassing illusionary, offensive, and amplification effects. By cleverly combining them, she can fully unleash their beneficial characteristics. If she hadn't underestimated Rong Bing that day, her domain would never have been broken. If you want to break that Thousand Illusions Domain, merely relying on ice-fire of the same origin might not be enough. However, as long as you can skillfully apply fusion magic, there's still a chance. Combat tactics in a competition are something no one can guide you on; only through the tempering of battle will you gain a deeper understanding of magic application.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded subconsciously, lost in thought. Prince Rong's explanation of domains was much more detailed than Rong Bing's, giving him a deeper understanding of domains.\n\nPausing, Prince Rong continued, \"Everything I've said so far was just an introduction, meant to give you some understanding of domains. Magic domains. For every magician, they are their most valuable possession. Therefore, domains are rarely documented in books; one can only unleash a domain suitable for themselves through continuous training. You are very good. Despite your young age, you've already cultivated to the Mage-god realm and can even create your own magic incantations. In this aspect, you're already stronger than I was in my youth. What I'm about to say, you must listen carefully to, as it bears a significant relation to your future path in magic. You must be very curious as to why the girl you competed against today was able to use a domain equivalent to an eighth-tier spell without chanting an incantation. And it was a very special domain at that.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"That's my biggest question. Can an eighth-tier spell also be instant-cast? I doubt even a Divine Descendant could do that. If Mu Jing can instant-cast a domain equivalent to an eighth-tier spell, then if it weren't on the competition stage, who could withstand her instant-casting such a domain at any time? My victory today was already extremely lucky.\"\n\nPrince Rong smiled faintly and said, \"Calmness is very important for a magician. You're doing well; being able to think about these issues after a victory proves you're very mature. Indeed, even a Divine Descendant cannot instant-cast an eighth-tier spell. What that girl cast today was a domain, and from a certain perspective, it no longer falls within the realm of magic. Because, that was her innate domain.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart lurched. \"Innate domain? What is an innate domain?\"\n\nPrince Rong sighed lightly and said, \"Even I didn't expect to see an innate domain possessor in this competition. The chance of an innate domain appearing is extremely small. It refers to an ability that humans naturally possess under certain circumstances. Such an innate ability naturally doesn't require any incantations to activate. As long as the possessor's will reaches it, it can naturally be cast. Very few people possess innate domains, and most innate domains only have very ordinary characteristics and cannot exert any powerful effects. I don't know if your luck is too good or too bad, but your opponent today not only possesses an innate domain, but also an evolvable innate domain that integrates offense and defense and is filled with natural aura. Her domain can not only absorb natural magic energy but also be used for attack and defense. Its power is immense, and its scope of application is extremely wide. It's a good thing you have many variations in your magic, and at first, she didn't fully unleash her attack, which gave you a chance. The most terrifying aspect of this evolvable innate domain is its evolution. Regardless of whether the possessor of this domain is a warrior or a magician, the domain will continuously improve with their strength. If she were a Mage-god now, even I would find it difficult to defeat her. However, judging by her appearance, the time her innate domain has been awakened shouldn't be too long, and she's still unable to fully unleash the profound mysteries of the domain. The Langmu Empire has truly produced a treasure this time.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Grandfather, just how many people possess this kind of evolvable innate domain? Is there no way to counter such magicians? How does one fight against an instant-cast domain that powerful?\"\n\nPrince Rong smiled faintly and said, \"Nothing is absolute. While innate domains are indeed powerful, they are difficult to sustain. Moreover, because an innate domain's appearance consumes a large amount of the body's energy, further enhancing one's strength becomes very difficult, especially promoting the evolution of the domain—that's even harder. Therefore, if you encounter an innate domain possessor that is difficult to contend with, delay as much as possible. You don't have an innate domain, but don't you even have magic scrolls? As long as you use scrolls for defense until you can cast powerful offensive spells, unless you encounter an anomalous innate domain like today's, you should generally be able to contend with them. Therefore, you must put more effort into making magic scrolls. Although using scrolls doesn't greatly benefit your magic progress, they are good tools for saving your life. A magician's fragile body needs to be protected by scrolls in normal times. Even at my level and that of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, we wouldn't dare say we don't carry a single magic scroll. Otherwise, if we encountered a powerful assassin, wouldn't all our life's efforts be wasted? However, you don't need to worry too much about innate domain possessors. There are only about thirty evolvable innate domain possessors who have reached Mage-god strength or higher on the entire continent. As far as I know, only one has reached strength beyond Mage-god, and you know who that is: the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess.\"\n\n\"What? The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess is also an innate domain possessor?\" Nian Bing looked at Prince Rong in shock. A Divine Descendant is already formidable enough, and she's also an innate domain possessor. Is there still hope for my revenge?\n\nPrince Rong smiled calmly and said, \"What? Are you afraid? The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess is a monster. I've witnessed her innate domain; fortunately, it's only a supportive innate domain. Otherwise, truly no one on the continent would be able to contend with her. Once her domain is cast, everything within a thousand zhang⁴ radius will transform into a world of ice and snow, allowing her magic to exert its maximum power. Although her innate domain has relatively no stronger direct effect, it is precisely this domain's supportive ability that has enabled her to rapidly increase her strength and reach the Divine Descendant realm. So, everything has two sides to it; there's no absolute bad, nor absolute good. Oh, right, have you heard of the Continent of Gods?\"\n___\n¹*Hèn tiě bù chéng gāng* (恨鐵不成鋼): A Chinese idiom meaning to be disappointed with someone for not living up to expectations, or to wish one could mold iron into steel.\n²*Lǎozi* (老子) is a somewhat rude or informal way for an elder to refer to themselves, implying authority or exasperation. *Bái jiào le* (白叫了) means \"would be called for nothing\" or \"would be for naught.\"\n³A Mage-god (魔導士) is a specific rank for magicians in this fictional world.\n⁴A *zhang* (丈) is a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or 10 feet.

    "content": "Nian Bing nodded and said, \"I've heard of it. Aren't so-called gods all formed from humans cultivating?\"\n\nDuke Rong looked at Nian Bing in surprise and said, \"You actually know? The Gods' Continent is an absolute secret to the Yangguang Continent, but one thing I can be sure of is that those fellows who call themselves gods all possess a Congenital Domain. From this, you can see how important a Congenital Domain is. If the Ice Goddess Priestess continues cultivating, she might very well become a member of the Gods' Continent. I am old now; whether I have a Congenital Domain or not, I'm afraid I'll never be able to go there. Nian Bing, do you know? I only have two greatest wishes in my life: one is to be able to go back to my youth and save your mother's life*, and the other is to go to the Gods' Continent and see what strange things are there.\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment and said, \"Grandfather, under what circumstances can one determine if a person has a Congenital Domain? Just now I heard you mention 'awakening,' isn't a Congenital Domain innate?\"\n\nDuke Rong said, \"A Congenital Domain is indeed innate, but no one knows under what circumstances a child with a Congenital Domain is born. Upon leaving the mother's body, the Congenital Domain exists, but existence doesn't mean it can be used. Generally speaking, a Congenital Domain user's Congenital Domain lies dormant during childhood. It continuously absorbs the host body's energy to grow, and only manifests when it grows to a certain extent. Its manifestation is very sudden, so most people with a Congenital Domain become Congenital Domain users overnight. Generally, if a person's Congenital Domain hasn't awakened by the age of thirty, it can be concluded that they are not a Congenital Domain user. I know what you want to say; even now, I can't confirm whether you will possess a Congenital Domain. After all, you still have some distance until you're thirty. Work hard on your cultivation. A top-tier magician isn't necessarily worse than a Congenital Domain user.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"It seems I still have a chance. More than eleven years left.\"\n\nDuke Rong also laughed. \"It seems the Congenital Domain has affected you greatly. However, I advise you not to hold too much hope. When I was your age, I also hoped to become a Congenital Domain user. The closer one gets to thirty, the stronger this feeling becomes, but after thirty, this feeling gradually fades. You must understand, aside from the low probability of becoming a Congenital Domain user, even if a Congenital Domain truly awakens, it's not necessarily a useful domain. Of course, if you truly can possess a good Congenital Domain, then the closer to thirty you awaken, the more advantageous it is for you. Because the longer a Congenital Domain gestates within you, the more energy it absorbs, and once the domain awakens, it will certainly bring you powerful abilities.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Grandfather, please rest assured. Although I very much hope to obtain a Congenital Domain, my mindset is good. It's certainly a good thing to possess a Congenital Domain, but I won't be discouraged if I don't. After all, I'm already quite content with having the Ice and Fire Homologous ability. Just Ice and Fire Homologous and Mimicry Magic alone, I don't know when I'll be able to cultivate them to their utmost.\"\n\nDuke Rong said, \"That's for the best. What needed to be said has been said. Take this. Starting tonight, come find me in the study. Your magic foundation is very solid. I will impart some of my insights on magic to you. A few days should be enough.\"\n\nNian Bing was startled and said, \"A few days will be enough?\" Duke Rong had already reached the realm of a God Descendant Master, and his decades of insights into magic were extraordinary. Although Nian Bing was confident in his own intelligence, he wasn't sure he could grasp what Duke Rong taught in just a few days.\n\nDuke Rong said, \"Your identity cannot be exposed yet. Before your magic truly matures, remaining hidden in the shadows will be more advantageous for you. The 'few days' I mentioned are just for you to record everything that needs to be remembered. As for when you can comprehend it, that will depend on your talent and effort.\"\n\nBidding farewell to Duke Rong, Nian Bing left the Imperial Palace. Along the way, he continuously pondered. The reason he agreed to return to the Rong family today was certainly related to benefits, but more importantly, he was moved by the familial affection Duke Rong inadvertently showed and the status his father most wished for. As he walked, Nian Bing silently prayed in his heart, \"Father, you must be very happy knowing I've returned to the Rong family, right? You don't need to have any more regrets. Grandfather has already agreed to have you reinstated within the Rong family's walls. Please rest assured, I will work hard. Since I promised him, I will definitely do it.\"\n\nWhen Nian Bing returned to the inn and entered the room, he immediately felt that the atmosphere was wrong. Feng Nü was sitting on the bed, somewhat dazed, her delicate brows tightly furrowed, and complex light continuously flickering in her eyes. Her appearance startled Nian Bing. Thinking something major had happened, he quickly walked over and asked, \"Feng Nü, what's wrong? Did something happen?\"\n\nFeng Nü looked up at Nian Bing's concerned gaze. \"You won the competition today?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"What's wrong with you? Did your Phoenix Clan people come again?\"\n\nFeng Nü's eyes flickered, her eyes suddenly reddened, and she abruptly threw herself into Nian Bing's embrace, bursting into tears. \"Why? Why did you deceive me? Why did you deceive me?\"\n\nNian Bing was startled. He quickly embraced Feng Nü's delicate body tightly, stroking the perfect curve of her back. \"What's wrong? What did I do to make you so angry?\"\n\nFeng Nü held Nian Bing tightly, continuously weeping but refusing to say anything. Tears soaked Nian Bing's chest, leaving him feeling somewhat helpless for a moment.\n\nAfter a long while, Feng Nü's crying finally gradually stopped. *In Nian Bing's embrace, she choked out, \"Why are you so good to me? Do you know? The more you are like this, the more I can't bear to leave you.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart sank slightly. He said, \"Feng Nü, what exactly happened to make you so agitated?\"\n\nFeng Nü turned her head away, looking at the nearby table. Nian Bing followed her gaze and immediately understood the reason for Feng Nü's agitation: a table full of dishes had been laid out.\n\n\"Feng Nü, actually, actually...\"\n\n\"You don't need to say it. Such unpalatable food. You actually ate all of it that day. No wonder you went to the toilet so many times. Nian Bing, I'm sorry.\"\n\nNian Bing's gaze softened. \"Silly girl, what is there to apologize for? As long as it's something you've made, it's a delicacy on Earth to me! Because it's your heartfelt intention.\"\n\nFeng Nü's delicate body trembled slightly, and the arms embracing Nian Bing tightened further. \"But, but...\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, and with both hands, cupped Feng Nü's tear-streaked pretty face*. \"Silly girl, every word I say is true. No one is born knowing how to do everything. As long as you're willing to work hard, you'll eventually be able to make delicious food, won't you? Don't you think it's quite interesting to let my stomach grow along with your culinary skills?\" As he spoke, he even made a comical expression.\n\nFeng Nü chuckled. \"You're so annoying! If this continues, I'm afraid you'll be poisoned by me before my cooking skills even improve. Aren't you afraid?\"\n\n\"No, of course not. If one day I truly die, what I'd most hope for is to die by your hand. To die beneath a peony, even as a ghost, I'd be romantic*, hehe.\"\n\nFeng Nü covered Nian Bing's mouth. \"Annoying! Don't say such inauspicious things. You're not allowed to eat my cooking again until my skills improve. Do you know how anxious I was when you suddenly fell ill the day before yesterday? You also wouldn't tell me the reason, no wonder you refused to see a doctor then. So it turns out I was the cause.\" As she spoke, her eyes couldn't help but redden again.\n\nNian Bing lightly kissed Feng Nü's hand. Feng Nü withdrew her hand as if shocked, a blush rising on her pretty face, and she nestled back into Nian Bing's embrace.\n\n\"Feng Nü, what did you mean earlier by 'can't bear to leave me'? Do you want to leave?\" Although he was embracing her incomparably enchanting body, Nian Bing's mind remained very clear.\n\nFeng Nü's body trembled slightly, and she whispered, \"Nian Bing, I'm afraid I can't stay with you anymore. These days spent with you have been the happiest days of my life. However, if I leave, I'm afraid chaos has already appeared within the Phoenix Clan. For the sake of my clan members, I must return. Only by further enhancing my strength will I be able to cope with the trials of the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony.\"\n\nNian Bing fell silent. Although their life together these days had been simple, how could Nian Bing, having grown accustomed to this simple life, bear to let Feng Nü leave? However, Feng Nü had her own pursuits, her own mission. Even if he was reluctant, Nian Bing didn't want Feng Nü to live in unhappiness and regret. He lightly kissed her forehead and said, \"Frankly speaking, I truly can't bear to part with you. However, I also know that I have no right to stop you from leaving. After all, the Phoenix Clan raised you and has shown you kindness, and they are also your clan members. But, can you promise me one thing? I hope you can leave after my competition ends. Remember, I had something to tell you before your Phoenix Clan members came looking for you a few days ago, right? I will tell you some things after my competition concludes, and then you can decide whether to leave, okay?\" Currently, he certainly couldn't let Feng Nü go; the task Yu Ru Yan had entrusted him with was not yet complete. He simply hoped to tell her later so as not to affect her state of mind.\n\nFeng Nü didn't ask further, she merely nodded gently and said, \"Okay, I promise you. But you must also promise me that no matter when, you will prioritize your own safety.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Sister, what exactly happened today? How could you, with your Earth Goddess Domain, lose to that kid? You were really too careless,\" Mu Rong said to Mu Jing with some dissatisfaction.\n\nMu Jing's eyes seemed a little lost. She said, \"Nothing is absolute, Brother. I truly lost. Before coming here, I always thought that with my Congenital Domain, I could even contend with someone like Duke Rong. Now it seems I was wrong, and terribly so. Didn't you realize how strong Nian Bing, who fought me today, was? His magic is the strangest I've ever seen. If I didn't have a Congenital Domain, I wouldn't even have had a chance to contend with him. How strong an insight must one possess to be able to control Five-Element Magic! At least, in the history of magic, I've never heard of anyone being able to use Five-Element Magic. Especially that magic he used when he broke my Earth Goddess Domain—it fused two extreme magic forces, ice and fire, without losing the inherent characteristics of both magics. The magic power generated when it suddenly erupted was indeed already close to the level of tenth-tier magic.\"\n\nMu Rong frowned and said, \"But, with your Congenital Domain, if you had attacked with full force from the start, he might not have had a chance to chant incantations.\"\n\nMu Jing scoffed coldly and said, \"Then you've underestimated him too much. Didn't you see what magic items he used? Five God-tier Magic Items, each one a top-tier item within its respective magic type. With these things, he could fully cope until he chanted a magic incantation. Just his space-element short-distance instantaneous movement alone isn't something that can be easily countered. Although my Earth Goddess Domain is miraculous, after all, it awakened too recently; it's not yet sufficient for large-scale, seamless attacks. Although I lost today, I found that this magician named Nian Bing has immeasurable prospects for the future, and his dangerousness is definitely above Qian Huan Bing Yun's.\"\n\nMu Rong was startled and said, \"Do you mean to say his strength is even greater than Qian Huan Bing Yun's?\"\n\nMu Jing's brows furrowed slightly. She said, \"Brother, Father Emperor has always valued your cleverness, and you are the Crown Prince, so why do you think so simply? That Nian Bing might not be a match for Qian Huan Bing Yun right now, but looking at his potential, one day his achievements will probably far surpass mine. Judging by his appearance, he's only about twenty years old. A magician of about twenty who can also use five types of magic—think about it, who in the history of the continent could achieve that? Even among those humans who call themselves gods, I'm afraid there isn't anyone. I dare say, even the Ice Goddess Priestess at his age definitely didn't possess such strength. Although Qian Huan Bing Yun is very strong, most of her strength is built upon the teachings and assistance of the Ice Goddess Priestess. But can you tell whose disciple that Nian Bing is? From his imaginative attacks in the magic competition, it's clear he has absolutely no lack of practical combat experience. If his current achievements are all derived from his own comprehension*, then that's truly terrifying.\"\n\nA cold glint flashed in Mu Rong's eyes. He said, \"There are only two ways to deal with someone like this: first, recruit him for our own use, and he will certainly become a huge asset; the other is to cut the grass and remove the roots*, not giving him a chance to develop. Sister, do you think this person can be utilized by us?\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n*   The original text uses asterisks (***) here, likely referring to Nian Bing's mother.\n*   The original text includes an asterisk (*) here, indicating a pause or an omitted action.\n*   \"梨花帶雨\" (líhuā dàiyǔ) literally means \"pear blossoms with rain,\" an idiom describing the tear-streaked face of a beautiful woman.\n*   \"牡丹花下死，做鬼也風流\" (mǔdan huā xià sǐ, zuò guǐ yě fēngliú) is an idiom implying that dying for a beautiful woman (or for love/beauty) is a romantic and worthwhile fate.\n*   The original text includes an asterisk (*) here, likely implying \"relying on\" or \"from.\"\n*   \"斬草除根\" (zhǎncǎo chúgēn) literally means \"to cut the grass and remove the roots,\" an idiom meaning to eliminate completely or nip in the bud.",

    "content": "Mu Jing’s gaze appeared somewhat hazy; it’s hard to say, as I can’t see into his heart. On the first day of the competition, he acted savagely, killing two people in a row, but in today’s match, he not only didn’t strike mercilessly at me but also used water and light magic to nourish and revive my Earth Goddess Domain. If I had relied solely on my own strength, a wound like that would have taken at least three days to recover. So, it’s hard to say precisely what kind of person he is now. Big Brother, since I won this time, you’ve already secretly dispatched the Mu Assassination Group, haven’t you? Have them prepare. Even if we can’t buy him off, just destroying him and acquiring those treasures in his possession would be very beneficial for the future development of our Langmu Empire’s magic world.”\n\nA cold sneer flashed in Mu Rong’s eyes. He said, “Do you still remember that day? The woman who was with him that day clearly has an unusual relationship with him. For a mage like him, there are only three possibilities to attract his attention: first, money and status—this possibility is the smallest; second, valuable magic items; and third, peerless beauties. The latter two have a higher chance of success. We’ll try them one by one and see if we can get his attention. However, little sister, you’ve misjudged one thing: that kid’s magic blades aren’t so easy to take. If I’m not mistaken, the two blades he used to defeat you are respectively inlaid with the Rong family’s Fire God Stone and the Ice God Tower’s Ice Snow Goddess Stone. These two treasures are quite hot to handle!*”\n\nMu Jing smiled slightly and said, “I like things that are hot to handle* the most. If he truly refuses to submit to us, we must act without anyone knowing†. At that time, who would know we were the ones who made the move?”\n\n…\n\nThe Five Nations Rising Star Mage Competition entered its fourth day. The two matches to be held today were Mu Rong versus Rong Bing, and Nian Bing versus Rong Ji. The battle between Mu Rong and Rong Bing had no suspense at all. Rong Bing had already seen Mu Rong’s usual attack methods, so how could he give him a chance to use his Nature Domain? Although Rong Bing lost to Bingyun, within the same group, only he, besides Qianhuan Bingyun, had reached the Archmage level. However, Mu Rong handled the match very cleverly. As soon as he realized he was no match for Rong Bing, he immediately conceded, preventing Rong Bing from secretly harming him.\n\nStanding on the competition stage, Nian Bing looked at Rong Ji before him, narrowing his eyes. Rong Ji gave him a very peculiar feeling, like a volcano about to erupt; his surface aura wasn’t as reserved as Rong Bing’s. However, the aura he exuded was full of wild and domineering energy. Nian Bing knew that this battle would be anything but easy for him. However, last night in Prince Rong’s study, Prince Rong imparted to him many insights into magic, as well as some special magic spells, which greatly enhanced Nian Bing’s understanding of magic. Although he couldn’t fully digest them in a short time, his intelligence still allowed him to benefit greatly.\n\nRong Fei, acting as a referee, was observing Nian Bing. He was quite depressed at the moment. After returning to the Rong mansion yesterday, he discussed with his second brother, but before they could reach a conclusion, Prince Rong returned. Prince Rong issued a series of strange orders, almost every one of them aimed at Nian Bing, and strictly decreed that anyone who dared to harm Nian Bing would be immediately dealt with by family law. For so many years, this was the first time Rong Fei had seen his elder brother so serious. He hadn’t even interfered in the disputes between the two factions of the Rong family, but this time, he directly issued orders—orders that no Rong family member could defy.\n\nRong Fei announced the start of the match. Rong Ji didn’t attack immediately. The usually reserved Rong Ji spoke, “Hello, although I really want to compete against you and see who is stronger, I’m afraid I can’t now. I concede.” After speaking, he reconfirmed with Rong Fei, then turned and walked off the stage.\n\nRong Fei, who evidently already knew what was happening, coughed and looked at the somewhat dazed Nian Bing, saying, “Alright, contestant Rong Ji concedes this match. Nian Bing, you win.”\n\nThe Huarong Empire’s officials in the viewing stands immediately burst into an uproar upon seeing such a result. Emperor Huatian frowned, his gaze sweeping towards Prince Rong. Prince Rong looked at him calmly and nodded. At this moment, the only one on the viewing stand whose expression remained unchanged was Prime Minister Su Yue. He smiled as he looked at Prince Rong, a hint of deep meaning in his eyes.\n\nThe match ended as simply as that. Nian Bing’s last opponent in the group stage was that space-elemental mage. For him, who could also use space magic, the outcome of that match had no suspense at all. And the crucial match for the other spot in the finals would be tomorrow’s battle between Mu Jing and Rong Ji.\n\nLeaving the imperial palace, Nian Bing walked slowly down the streets of Dutian City. He knew very well that the victory he obtained today was by no means as simple as Rong Ji wanting to conserve strength for tomorrow’s match. It was clearly because his grandfather, Prince Rong, had given the order for him to deliberately concede, which led to this outcome. He wondered what Emperor Huatian was thinking, after all, Rong Ji represented the Huarong Empire.\n\n“Can we talk?” a cold voice suddenly sounded.\n\nNian Bing’s heart leaped. From the sensation of his spiritual power, this voice was clearly directed at him. Turning around, he saw Bingyun, whose face was veiled with white gauze, standing not far behind him. Seeing the symbol of the Ice God Tower on her, a surging sense of hatred rose within him. Nian Bing suppressed the flames of hatred in his heart and calmly said, “If you’re here for the Ice Snow Goddess Stone, then there’s nothing to talk about.”\n\nQianhuan Bingyun slowly walked up to Nian Bing. “Not just that, I think your current appearance isn’t your original one, is it, sir?”\n\nNian Bing’s heart trembled. “Who’s that? I’m afraid you’ve got the wrong person.”\n\nQianhuan Bingyun took out a small mirror from her bosom. “This was given to me. It’s called the Demon-Reflecting Mirror. For any creature, this mirror can reveal what’s behind magical enchantments. I think this isn’t our first meeting in Dutian City. Do you want me to invite the Seventh Prince over?”\n\nNian Bing joked with a hint of mockery, “As expected of someone from the Ice God Tower, you certainly have a lot of treasures on you! It seems the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess truly regards you as her successor. Let’s go sit somewhere.” Saying this, he casually pointed to a nearby restaurant. It wasn’t mealtime, so the restaurant was quite deserted. The appearance of the two immediately caught the attention of a waiter as they entered.\n\n“Sir, miss, are you dining?” the waiter politely asked. He stole a glance at Bingyun, and immediately, a shiver ran down his spine. He quickly withdrew his gaze. What a cold young woman.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, “We’ll just grab a bite. Let’s sit here.” He pointed to a table near the window, and he and Qianhuan Bingyun walked over.\n\nThe waiter followed them to the table. “What would you two like to eat?”\n\nNian Bing offered Bingyun an inquiring look. Although she was the disciple of his enemy, he still maintained a gentleman’s demeanor. Bingyun calmly said, “I’m not used to ordinary food. Order whatever you want.”\n\nNian Bing gave a self-deprecating laugh, “Ah, yes! You’re a goddess, how could you be used to ordinary food? Waiter, what are your specialties? Just bring me four random dishes.”\n\nThe cold aura emanating from Bingyun’s body had long since become unbearable for the waiter. Even the most beautiful woman wasn’t as important as his own life. He gave a quick affirmation and hurried away.\n\nNian Bing leaned back in his chair, a hint of an elegant smile on his face. “Miss Qianhuan Bingyun, what do you wish to discuss? You can speak now.”\n\n“So, you were summoned by the imperial capital but then disappeared. I never expected to find you here, representing the Bingyue Empire in the Mage Competition. Should I consider you a chef or a mage?”\n\nNian Bing calmly said, “That’s up to you. However, there’s one thing you need to understand clearly: I am not representing the Bingyue Empire, but rather the Bingyue Empire Mage Guild. I have no connection with the Bingyue Empire.”\n\nBingyun calmly said, “I can see that. Your appearance is almost identical to that person named Rong Bing; presumably, your relationship with the Rong family is very deep. There’s only one person who could simultaneously possess both the Ice Snow Goddess Stone and the Fire God Stone, but he should have died eight years ago.”\n\nA sharp light flared in Nian Bing’s eyes. “Since you know so much, why bother talking to me? Those who ‘should have died’ aren’t necessarily truly dead.”\n\nBingyun said, “So, that means you truly are Rong Tian’s and my Senior Sister’s only son? A while ago, Master sensed the aura of the Ice Snow Goddess Stone—that was you releasing it, wasn’t it?”\n\nNian Bing coldly snorted, saying, “So what? You guessed entirely correctly. If I recall correctly, the Ice Snow Goddess Stone was originally given to my mother by the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, and my mother then gave it to me. If you want it back, then take my corpse along with it. Of course, you’d need the ability to do so. However, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess is really good to you. You don’t look older than me, yet you know all these things. It seems the rumors that you will inherit that old hag’s mantle weren’t wrong.”\n\n“You’re very confident. Do you believe I can kill you right now?” Bingyun’s voice grew several shades colder, and the surrounding air seemed to solidify.\n\nNian Bing coldly said, “Confidence speaks through strength. I think, if all goes well, we’ll meet in the finals.”\n\nBingyun said, “I don’t want your Ice Snow Goddess Stone. What I want is you.”\n\nNian Bing joked mischievously, saying, “I’m sorry, but I’m already taken‡. Although I’m very handsome, I wouldn’t want certain parts of myself to get frostbitten.”\n\n“You…” A rare hint of panic appeared in Bingyun’s eyes. She raised her hand and struck towards Nian Bing, a sharp ice cone appearing like lightning before Nian Bing. Nian Bing raised his hand and gripped the ice cone. At this moment, the sharpness of the ice cone was less than three inches from his eye. A faint scorching aura emanated from Nian Bing’s body. The ice cone melted into water, then evaporated into steam, as if it had never appeared.\n\n“Can’t wait? Want to make a move now? I’m ready anytime.” Nian Bing’s voice also grew cold.\n\n“I hope you show a little more respect. After all, you are also an Archmage,” Bingyun said with some resentment.\n\nNian Bing chuckled mockingly, looking at Bingyun flippantly as he said, “Respect depends on who it’s used for. For people from your Ice God Tower, do you think I should have any respect? In my eyes, most women from your Ice God Tower are worse than prostitutes. At least prostitutes have some emotions, and most prostitutes are forced into it, but what about you? You’re just a bunch of cold, lifeless statues. If a person loses even their emotions, can they still be called human?” As long as it was something unfavorable to the Ice God Tower, he would not hesitate to do it; insult was just the first step.\n\nBingyun suddenly stood up, and the temperature throughout the restaurant plummeted. “Insulting the Ice God Tower—just this one point is enough for you to die a hundred times over.”\n\nNian Bing remained in his seat. “Is that so? Did I say anything wrong? Do you believe emotions still exist within you? As far as I know, you’ve never known what emotions are. Otherwise, how would my parents have died? Your coming to find me today was a mistake in itself. Even if you know my identity, do you think that can threaten me? For the enemies who harmed my parents, I think there’s nothing else to discuss besides revenge. Your Master, your Ice God Tower, destroyed my happiness. I will return it to you tenfold, a hundredfold. I want to erase the Ice God Tower from the continent!” As he spoke the last few words, he enunciated each one distinctly, suppressed hatred suddenly bursting from his eyes, as if intending to pierce Qianhuan Bingyun before him.\n\nUnfortunately, gazes cannot kill after all. Upon hearing Nian Bing’s words, Bingyun instead calmed down, slowly sat back in her seat, and said, “Do you think you can take revenge?”\n\n“No,” Nian Bing replied quickly. “With my current strength, seeking revenge would undoubtedly be like striking a rock with an egg§. However, ‘now’ doesn’t mean ‘forever,’ do you think?”\n\nBingyun sneered, “Do you think you still have a ‘forever’? Regardless of the means I use, after this competition, I will take you back to the Ice God Tower for Master to deal with you.”\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, “Alright then! Whatever you want. However, you should consider the Rong family’s influence before saying that to me. After all, I also bear the surname Rong.”\n\nJust then, the waiter brought the food. Nian Bing picked up his chopsticks, took a piece of stewed beef, and chewed it. “Mm, the taste is alright, but the seasoning is a bit too strong; it doesn’t highlight the beef’s natural freshness. Still, for an ordinary restaurant, it’s barely acceptable. Miss Bingyun, would you like to try some? Oh, right, I remember the Ice God Tower members are all vegetarians, aren’t they?”\n\nBingyun’s eyes were filled with disgust. She impatiently glanced at the food on the table. She said, “Are you relying on the Rong family to protect you? That’s useless. Because I believe you’ll choose to come back with me on your own.”\n\n---\n*   **Hot to handle**: Implies something valuable but difficult or dangerous to possess.\n†   **Without anyone knowing**: Literally \"gods don't know, ghosts don't perceive.\"\n‡   **Already taken**: An idiom, literally \"the famous grass has an owner,\" meaning one is already in a romantic relationship.\n§   **Striking a rock with an egg**: An idiom meaning a futile or suicidal attempt.",

    "content": "Nian Bing narrowed his eyes and looked at Bingyun, \"Why did you start dreaming in broad daylight? Of course, if you are willing to sleep with me, I can still consider your proposal. However, I can only walk one meter at a time. I guess when I reach the Ice God Tower, you are already seventy-eighty. Maybe, the children have given me a bunch of them, hahahaha.\"\n\n\n\n\"You...\" Bingyun raised his hand and sang to Nian Bing's face. Nian Bing's eyes flashed with a cold light and grabbed her cold little hand, \"Do you think you are a warrior? Put away your claws.\" He said and threw Bingyun's hand out.\n\n\n\nQianhuan Bingyun, when did he receive such insults from childhood to adulthood? His plump breasts kept rising and falling because of anger. However, she did not act any more. \"You are not worthy of being a noble magician. Are you proud to insult me? Well, if I tell you something now, you will probably be a little cold. Your parents are not dead.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing, who was still eating vegetables, froze all over his body, and the divine light in his eyes stormed. Seeing Qian Huan Bingyun couldn't help but feel a little worried. He suddenly stumbled over the table, \"You, what are you talking about?\"\n\n\n\nBingyun looked at Nian Bing coldly and said, \"I said, your parents were not dead. The warrior did not kill your parents that year, but just sealed them and detained them. Of course, their situation may change at any time when they are sealed in the ice. As for the places where they are detained, only the teacher and I know. Now, should you consider my proposal?\"\n\n\n\n  Bang bang, bang bang... Nian Bing's heartbeat kept accelerating. Her handsome face looked a little red because of the excitement. Her heart was swelling like a swell. Her parents were not dead, and ecstasy kept invading his heart. Unconsciously, Nian Bing clenched her fists tightly, and the excitement replaced hatred. He now only has one idea in his mind, that is, to rescue his parents from prison. Think of the suffering parents in the Ice God Tower. Nian Bing's eyes couldn't help but red, and her clenched fists were shaking slightly. \n\n\n\nLooking at the complex emotions in Nian Bing's eyes, a strange feeling suddenly rose in Bingyun's heart. The man in front of him didn't seem to be as upset as he had just been.\n\n\n\n\"Now. Should you decide to go to the Ice God Tower with me? Maybe, the teacher will let you see your parents' last time.\" Bingyun said coldly.\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at Bingyun with a strange look, \"You just said that only you and your teacher know about the place where my parents are being held, is that right?\"\n\n\n\nBingyun suddenly felt something was wrong, but she didn't know where the wrong was. \"No, only the teacher and I knew it.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing points his head and said, \"Okay. I understand. I will go to the Ice God Tower.\" His expression returned to normal. He picked up the chopsticks again and slowly ate the ground food on the table.\n\n\n\nWhy was he so calm? Bingyun was a little confused, and his eyes at Nian Bing also changed.\n\n\n\n\"We have come here a little bit. Let's keep it in the elegant room on the floor.\"A loud voice sounded, and more than a dozen people walked in from outside. It was obvious that most of them were from there. They walked in clusters with a beautiful young man in dress. Although the young man looked good, his face looked a little white. His golden length and the golden lion logo on his chest symbolized his noble identity.\n\n\n\nThe service student bowed his head and greeted him, \"It turns out that Xiao Wang is here. Please, please, Yajie will be kept for you.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing raised her head and snorted disdainfully, \"It's another little prince, it's funny, it's so funny. Why don't there be so many people in the world?\"\n\n\n\nAlthough Nian Bing's voice was not loud, the young man's subordinates were obviously very human. He had been shooting at them at this table, and several of them had already walked over to Nian Bing's table.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, what a smelly girl.\" The young man snatched his hands, and his subordinates stopped at the table. He walked to Nian Bing, glanced at Nian Bing and stopped on Bingyun's face. \"It was just a dog that was barking. He cut his tongue with his hand. I'll kill you.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing leaned on the back of the chair, \"Okay! You are willing to cut your tongue yourself. I can really save you your life. Rong's family's failures should be cleaned up.\"\n\n\n\nThe young man said coldly, \"Since you are seeking death, don't blame me. Take action and keep him breath.\"\n\n\n\nAs soon as the figure flashed, two people came to Nian Bing from the flash, and pressed their hands on his shoulder. Suddenly, their eyes flashed, and Nian Bing, who was originally sitting there, suddenly disappeared. When they looked up, Nian Bing was standing beside the young man at some point, holding a strange-shaped flashing sword in his hand. Nian Bing's powerful hands pinched the young man's neck, his eyes becoming unusually cold.\n\n\n\n\"You, what are you fucking?\" The young man's neck was a little hissing because he was strangled.\n\n\n\nNian Bing laughed and said, \"Don't worry, I won't kill you with a knife, let alone cut your tongue with it, because I'm afraid your blood will pollute my knife. Let your subordinates be honest, not afraid of telling you, I'm a magician, and I want your life as simple as turning my hands.\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't come over all.\" The young man was obviously very scared, and his body had already started to tremble. The subordinate who had originally secretly came up, stopped walking. \n\n\n\nBingyun stood up, and didn't even look at the young man, and said to Nianbing, \"Do you think it's interesting? I'll look for you again after the game.\" After saying that, he turned around and walked outside. The young man's subordinates wanted to slap her, but there was a roar on everyone's shoulders.\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at him with some luck, and was overestimating his ability to attack the people of the Ice God Tower. Bingyun left, Nian Bing smiled and looked at the young man in his hand and said, \"If I remember it well, your name should be Rongyao. Well, it should be Rongfei's eldest son, that's right.\"\n\n\n\nRong Yao heard Nian Bing and mentioned his name, and his enthusiasm was very strong. \"Hmph, since you know who I am, don't let go quickly. In this Dutian City, no one dares to offend our Rong family.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"So that's how it is! I'm really scared! Look, my hands are shaking.\" The silver-colored light shone in front of Mering Yao, as if it could fall any time.\n\n\n\n\"You, don't come. As long as you let me go, I won't be able to do anything.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing snorted and said, \"From small to old, your words seem to have not been counted. Don't worry, I won't kill you. Didn't kill you dirty my hands? But. It's up to you to be too drunk and erect, for the girls in Dutian City. I'll help you with a small punishment.\" The two cold and hot breaths rose up at the same time, and the clear and visible magic breath surrounded Nian Bing and Rongyao, making Rongyao's subordinates dare not move. With Nian Bing's magical control. It is no longer easy to control magical breathing for people like Rongyao who even have no real power to be a junior magician. The cold and the heat invaded the bright body at the same time. He could only feel that his lower body was cold and hot, and his whole body was constantly lingering. A strange feeling kept rising. He didn't know that he actually peed on his pussy. \n\n\n\nNian Bing's mocking voice sounded in his ears, \"How is it? Bing and Fire are good to wash away. Don't worry, I said I won't kill you. But you haven't heard the word \"imperfection\". I'm afraid you will lose the ability to be a man from now on, hahahaha.\" As the silver light flashed in laughter, Nian Bing's body disappeared, Rong Yao fell to the ground with a soft body. His men couldn't take care of me and missed Bing, so they hurriedly helped Rong Yao up.\n\n\n\nRong Yao's lips had turned blue and purple, but sweat kept coming out of his head, \"Kill him, kill him, kill him.\"\n\n\n\n Nian Bing remembered Rong Yao's appearance very clearly. When he was a child, he was the one who bullied Nian Bing the most. Rong Yao was the eldest son of Rong Fei and confiscated a group of Rong family little men. Nian Bing remembered the most clearly that Rong Yao came out to do something. Rong Yao brought a group of people to find him. Not only did he beat him up, but he also peed on him. At that time, Nian Bing remembered clearly that hatred had gradually emerged from that time. Although Rong Bing came back and beat Rong Yao and his group, Nian Bing never forgot about the insults he had suffered. Today, the moment Rongyao entered the door, he had already recognized Rongyao from the logo and his appearance on Rongyao. How could he not report it? If it weren't for the words of King Rong, he would have been killed long ago.\n\n\n\nThe Xinfan Magicians Continues, Nian Bing and Bingyun did not have any thoughts to become two groups. The second place in the first group was won by Merging Bing, and the second group, Merging Bing, and the second group, Merging Bing, used the innate domain as soon as the competition between Merging Bing, and the melting Bing was extremely depressed. The advantages of the innate domain are actually too obvious. If you can no longer use magic scroll, it is almost impossible to compete with it. After all, how can instant magic compare to the eight-level innate domain?In this way, the four people entering the game are Nian Bing, Bingyun, Mercedes and Mu Jing. \n\n\n\nThe pre-season is over, and the two geniuses will start the final game. Nianbing quietly enters the Royal Palace every night. He doesn't have to show the red jade lion that King Rong has given him. He can easily enter the Royal Palace with just the same appearance as Rongbing. King Rongbing's teachings are very strange and there is no explanation. He just tells Nianbing a lot of theoretical knowledge to let him memorize it. Although Nian Bing's memory is very strong, the knowledge that King of Mother has poured him into too much. It took a lot of effort to forget about it every day, especially the top magic spells of various systems. However, what made Nian Bing excited was that in King Rong's own secret room, there were even dark magical mantras. For him, these mantras were extremely expensive. Nian Bing did not tell King Rong's parents that he was still alive. After going back that day, he thought coldly and did not believe Bing Yun's words. After all, this was just her speech. Nian Bing dared not have too much hope. The higher the hope, the greater the disappointment. However, Bing Yun's words also made his heart liven up. At least, the goal of his actions must be changed.\n\n\n\nThe two days passed quickly, and the five-country new magician competition finally began. Early in the morning, Nian Bing bid farewell to the bird girl and came to the palace. The first competition was the battle between him and Rongbing's brothers. Under the arrangement of King Rongbing, just like the battle with Rongbing that day, Rongbing did not really fight with Nian Bing. He immediately recognized it, which surprised other magicians who were watching the battle. Apart from Nian Bing and Rongbing, no one understood the secrets.\n\n\n\nRongfei announced that Nian Bing would enter the final championship. Rongfei was very upset these days. Not only because of the orders of King Rongfei, but also because of his elders' experiences, he did not stop him from pursuing his son. \n\n\n\n\"The second scene is Ice God Tower Ice Cloud, Langmu Empire Mujing, please go on stage to compete.\"\n\n\n\nBingyun is still the original decoration, with white gauze covering it. At the final stage, the gap in strength has been narrowed a lot. In addition to the opponents who appeared in the Bingbing game, Bingyun and Mu Jing are the key points. If Bingyun wins, then the top two final matches will be included by the Bingmoon Empire. Since such multi-world competitions, they have never had such a situation.\n\n\n\nOn the stage, Mu Jing looked at Bingyun and smiled on her face, \"You think so. Although your absolute power is strong, you should be worse than Nian Bing in terms of transformation. Without using magic rolls, you can't compete with my territory at all. Even if you fight Nian Bing again, I won't give him time to deal with my territory, at least 70% of the championship. I'm going to settle for the champion in this world.\"\n\n\n\nBingyun said coldly, \"That's better than that, don't underestimate your opponent. Although the innate realm is a symbol of strength, it does not represent everything.\"\n\n\n\nMu Jing smiled indifferently and said, \"Is that? Then you try it.\"\n\n\n\n“The competition begins.\"Rong Fei announced a sound and retreated to the competition platform. A hundred great magicians moved all their magic power to condense a powerful defense boundary around the competition platform. The players who could enter the competition were the best in the competition. They did not dare to be careless, for fear that the defense boundary would be destroyed by the battle of the two people and would be shocked to Emperor Huatian.\n\n\n\nThe green light flashed in Dajing's eyes, and his body instantly floated up. The huge breath of life swept out, and the green color instantly covered the entire competition platform, which was the realm of the Earth Goddess.\n\n\n\nBingyun didn't move, her eyes were staring at the surging green swallowing towards her. Her white magic robe was automatically unspoken, and the blue ice flowers on her chest radiated dazzling brilliance. A layer of white light spreads with Bingyun's body as the center, and the degree of dissipation is not fast. However, wherever the white light passes, it becomes an ice and snow world, and the temperature drops sharply. When the large green color meets the white, it cannot invade the slightest. The lush green plant hangs onto a layer of ice and the spreading ends abruptly. Not only that, it shows a sign of shrinking.",

    "content": "「不，這不可能。」隱藏於綠色中的木晶驚呼道。\n\n  冰雲淡淡的道：「沒有什麼事情是不可能的，難道，就只有你可以擁有先天領域麼？我想，你的領域剛沉醉不久吧，同樣的，我的領域也是在來此之前剛剛沉醉的，吞噬一切自然能量的大地女神領域，也不可能吞噬我這冰封一切的冰雪女神領域。冰雪世界中的死寂，就是你那生命氣息的克星，現在，你還覺得我應該認輸麼？」\n\n  冰雪女神領域的出現，對在場所有人的震撼都是巨大的，沒有誰能想到，本就已經強悍如斯的冰雲，竟然還擁有如此強大的先天領域。\n\n  念冰全身一冷，目光閃爍，他並沒有畏懼什麼，場上的比賽對他來說已經不再重要，勝負已經很明朗了，他在思考，思考著如何才能應付冰雲的先天領域和千幻領域的融合，對於他來說，這幾乎是不可能獲勝的，憑藉冰雪女神領域，千幻冰雲的實力已經提升到了魔導師的層面。冰神塔，冰神塔，果然是一個無比強大的存在啊!僅僅是冰雪女神祭祀的弟子都已經達到如此程度。\n\n  融親王同樣皺起了眉頭，與旁邊的蘇越對視一眼，目光閃爍，似乎在考慮著什麼。\n\n  場上的比賽因為冰雪女神領域的出現進入了僵持狀態，木晶雖然竭力催動自己的大地女神領域，想要吞噬冰雪女神領域中冰地氣息。但是，冰畢竟是一種極端的能量，在領域的作用下，已經脫離了自然魔法力的範疇，無論她如何催動，也無法阻止自己的大地女神領域在壓迫中不斷退縮。木晶有些茫然了。自從領域沉醉後，她一直以為自己是得天獨厚的，但是，面對千幻冰雲，她卻感覺自己是如此地無力。 \n\n  小巧的魔法杖出現在冰雲手中，似乎控制先天領域並沒有耗費她太多的能力，抑揚頓挫的咒語清晰傳遍全場，「偉大的冰元素啊!凝聚吧，化為萬古寒川之冰，化為凝實月華之冰。冰與冰的融合，出現吧，雙色冰封球。」藍色的光點，在冰雪女神領域中快速凝結著，令眾人驟然的是，這原本是一個單體攻擊魔法咒語。竟然出現了變異。點點藍光。融合成十個雙色冰封球在冰雲面前排列成整齊的一排，冰封球的體積雖然比單個冰封球縮小了一倍，但是，這卻是十個雙色冰封球啊!冰雲抬起手，魔法杖向前指去。空中地冰封球在快速的滾動中如同粉碎機一般，所過之處，先前被凍結的植物紛紛化為齏粉，十個雙色冰封球呈半包圍之勢朝隱藏於大地女神領域中的木晶滾去。\n\n  「生命之花，我以自然的名義允許你。湛放出自然的氣息，吞噬一切外來的力量，化為無盡地生命滋潤自然吧。」木晶短暫的失神後立刻不甘的起了反擊，冰雪女神領域雖然對她的大地女神領域有一定的壓製作用，但想要破掉大地女神領域卻也不是容易的事。一朵朵黃色的小花在大地女神領域中漂浮而出，在領域的增幅作用下。它們快速的生長著，很快，就變成了數十個向葵，一道道柔和地黃色光芒從向日葵中中釋放，交錯成一片充滿生命氣息的黃色光網籠罩向十個雙色冰封球。\n\n  冰雲眉頭微皺，道：「你還不覺悟麼？沒有了領域的優勢，你如何會是我的對手呢？」手中魔法杖輕揮，十個雙色冰封球頓時變了，原本平行的它們驟然改變了隊形，變成了直直的一排，驟然回轉朝罩來地光網衝去。 \n\n  第一個冰封球在黃色光網的作用下消失了，化為水元素滋潤著大地女神領域，第二個冰封球緊接著消失，大地女神領域再次受到了滋潤，但是，那向日葵射出的光網卻已經出現了波動。雙色冰封球的攻擊是極為強悍的，當第五個被毀滅之時，向日葵射出的光芒再也抵擋不住冰封球的衝擊，剩餘的五個冰封球沖入大地女神領域之中發生了劇烈的爆炸，在爆炸的瞬間，無數冰屑飛濺而起，冰雪女神領域瞬間侵襲，使被雙色冰封球毀掉的大地女神領域無法復甦。此時，整個比賽台上已經有五分之四的面積被冰雪女神領域佔據，隨著咒語的吟唱，又是十個雙色冰封球出現在千幻冰雲周圍，但她卻沒有立刻發動攻擊。\n\n  「你的大地女神領域同樣是頂級領域，擁有著攻擊、防禦和增幅的作用，如果你的魔法力與我水平相當又在野外的話，恐怕失敗的將會是我，可惜，現在的你與我還有不小的差距，認輸吧，難道你真的要讓我毀掉你的領域傷到你的元氣麼？」\n\n  沉寂，木晶不甘心啊!但是，她卻明白，在現在的情況下，自己的領域被壓制，魔法力又遜於對方，除非奇蹟發生，已經不可能有機會了。此時，她更加嚮往這次比賽的獎品，那柄長生刀，如果有長生刀在手，自己又怎麼會輸呢？憑藉刀上的生命氣息，一切都將就可能。\n\n  比賽在主動認輸下結束了，千幻冰雲又一次在眾人面前展現了她強悍的實力，沒有誰想到，她以二十歲左右的年紀魔法竟然達到了如此高度，如此無法比擬的高度，局勢已經很明朗了，就算念冰沒有經過兩場重要比賽的消耗，也沒有人認為他能夠戰勝擁有先天領域的冰雲。 \n\n  走出皇宮，木晶低頭沉思著，一旁的木榮低聲道：「妹妹，別多想了，這次失敗並不是你的原因，輸給冰神塔的人並不丟人，畢竟，那是代表著大陸最高的魔法水平。只要你努力修煉，今後的成就未必就比不上那冰雲。」\n\n  木晶抬頭看了哥哥一眼。道：「你以為我在想今天地比賽麼？其實我早已預料到這個冰雲不會那麼簡單，能逼迫她用出先天領域，我已經算成功了，暴露了實力的對手總比深不可測的對手容易對付。哥，我們的人準備好了沒有？」\n\n  木榮點了點頭，道：「已經準備好了。隨時聽候我們的命令。」\n\n  木晶冷笑一聲，道：「好，只要我們的情報沒有錯，這次比賽之後，應有好戲看了，千幻冰雲必須要死，而那個念冰如果不肯歸順，一樣是死，我們朗木帝國隱忍了這麼多年，也該是出手地時候了。」\n\n  木榮微笑道：「妹妹，你知道麼。我真的很慶幸你不是男子，否則，這皇儲之位又如何輪到我呢？」\n\n  木晶瞥了他一眼，道：「現在說這些有什麼用？你放心好了，我會一心輔佐你繼承父親皇位的。不過，你也不要忘記答應過我的事。「\n\n  木榮正色道：「當然不會忘記，那是我對你的承諾。何況，答應你的這件事對我們朗木帝國如此有利，我又怎麼會變卦呢？我不是父親，不像他只會守城，我們的目標只有一個。」說著，他抬起了自己的右手。木晶同樣伸出右手與他相握，兩人心中同時迴蕩著四個字「一統大陸。」 \n\n  兩天過去了，又是夜幕降臨。身穿著金獅標誌魔法袍的念冰信步走入融親王府，他已經不是第一次來了，輕車熟路地朝書房走去，臉上帶著一絲淡淡的微笑，似乎心情很不錯的樣子，絲毫沒有被白天千幻冰雲所表現出的實力嚇倒。\n\n  推門而入。書房中燈火通明，這此些天融親王已經下令，沒有他的允許，融家人不許到書房中來，魔法的傳授是不能被打擾的。\n\n  「你來了。」蒼老地聲音響起，融親王穿了一件便服，正拿著一本魔法書看著。\n\n  念冰走到融親王面前，道：「你的臉色不太好啊!」\n\n  融親王合上書：「你覺得我的臉色應該好麼？那柄長生刀不知耗費了我多少力氣才得來的，可惜啊可惜!」\n\n  念冰微笑道：「您對我沒信心？」\n\n  融親王微微一笑，道：「我應該對你有信心麼？先天冰雪女神領域加上後天千幻領域，別說是你，就算是我，想要不藉助魔法捲軸獲勝也要花費不少力氣，畢竟，魔法咒語一向是制約魔法師的重要因素。對付她這樣的領域，魔武雙修高手更為合適。這兩天我想了很多應對方法，但成功的可能性都很小，魔法的修煉並不是朝夕之事，除非你今天能有第十一磁偏計一¹，否則，連十分之一的機會都沒有。這個叫冰雲地丫頭，以由下而上的實力發展下去，不出三十年，冰神塔必將再出一名神降師。她的領域你也看見了，比起大地女神領域還要強上幾分，就是今天的比賽她也未必用出了全力。」 \n\n  「那我們打賭吧。」念冰微笑的看著融親王。\n\n  「打賭？難道你有把握能夠獲勝？本來我對你的融合魔法也很有信心，否則也不會拿出長生刀了。不過，那冰雲在魔法實戰方面的經驗絕不比你少，根本不可能給你發揮的機會，就算你能發揮出融合魔法的優勢，也未必能勝。這還有什麼可賭的。」融親王驚訝的看著念冰。\n\n  念冰道：「現在說這些還為時過早，但也並不是沒有機會。就賭我和冰雲之間的勝負。如果我贏了，您要答應我一件事。如果我輸了，我也無條件答應您一件事，如何？」\n\n  融親王眼中流露出一絲淡淡的光芒，「小子，我吃的鹽比你吃的米都多²，用這種方法激我沒用？不過，我倒是想不出你有什麼辦法。」\n\n  經過這幾天的相處和融親王毫無保留的傳授，念冰與自己這位爺爺之間的氣氛早已經輕鬆了很多，「那您賭是不賭呢？一柄長生刀換一個條件而已，對您來說並不吃虧啊!您儘管放心，我要求的這件事與融家無關，只與您自己有關而已，我對權力並沒有什麼奢望。「\n\n  融親王笑道：「好，我就和你打這個賭，說吧，你有什麼條件想讓我答應？「\n\n  念冰眼中光芒一閃，道：「沒有獲勝之前，說了條件又能如何？等我贏了再說吧。「\n\n  融親王道：「看你的樣子，似乎真的很有把握似的，我倒是想知道你準備如何應付她的先天領域呢？「 \n\n  念冰嘿嘿一笑，湊到融親王身旁在他耳邊低語了幾句，聽了他的話融親王顯然吃了一驚，驚訝的看著念冰，「這樣也行？你小子太卑鄙了。「\n\n  念冰邪邪笑道：「這不是繼承了您的優良基因麼？「\n\n  「放屁！我什麼時候像你這樣了，你這小子真是狡猾，不過，這個辦法倒並不是不可行，至少你有一半的機會。你父親比你老實多了。「\n\n  「老實？我從小跟隨父親在大陸上東躲西藏的，後來又自己在大陸上行走，如果不狡猾一些，怎麼生存？「\n\n  融親王嘆息了一聲，道：「好了，說出你的條件吧，就算你輸了，我也答應你。「\n\n  念冰楞了一下，「爺爺，您是在可憐我麼？在外的磨礪並不是一件壞事，那天我答應了您的條件，以前的一切就已經放下。我的條件很簡單，請您不要去冰月帝國。」\n\n  融親王楞了一下，道：「不去？難道你怕我死在冰雪女神祭祀那老太婆手中？」\n\n  念冰搖了搖頭，道：「不，身為人子，替父母報仇是我分內的事，您戎馬一生，該歇歇了。這些事就交給我吧。」\n\n  念冰雖然說的很平靜，但他的目光卻流露出執著的光芒，那是信心的表現。\n\n  融親王深深的看著念冰，「好，好，你真的是長大了。如果融天還活著，看到自己的兒子如此出色，想必也會非常高興吧。盡全力去爭取吧，就算最後輸了也沒什麼。」他沒有告訴念冰為了這次能夠讓他獲得冠軍自己做了多少努力，單是說服華天大帝就耗費了他不少唇舌，他向華天大帝保證念冰將是自己的接班人，成為華融帝國未來的守護者，華天才同意讓融冰主動認輸。\n\n---\n¹ Translator's Note: The original Chinese term \"第十一磁偏計一\" appears to be a unique or possibly mistyped fantasy concept, possibly referring to a significant new ability or power level.

    "content": "Deep emotion showed in Nian Bing's eyes. \"I hope so. Grandpa, I need to prepare for tomorrow's competition. Please guard me.\"\n\nIt was already late. Nian Bing quietly returned to the inn. Feng Nü hadn't slept yet, waiting for him to come back.\n\n\"Silly girl, didn't I tell you to go to sleep first? It's so late already.\" Nian Bing looked at Feng Nü with a hint of reproach.\n\nFeng Nü smiled faintly and said, \"I can't sleep if you're not back, so I might as well practice a bit. For people like us, whether we sleep or not doesn't make much difference anymore.\"\n\nNian Bing reached out and pulled Feng Nü into his embrace, whispering, \"After tomorrow's competition, we'll leave here first thing the day after tomorrow.\"\n\nFeng Nü's eyes dimmed. \"Once the competition is over, I should return to the Phoenix Clan.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head. \"It's still too early to talk about that. After the competition, we'll have a good talk. Then, you can decide.\"\n\nFeng Nü felt a faint unease in her heart. She whispered, \"Nian Bing, I don't know why, but these past few days I've always felt like someone is watching us.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"You're overthinking it. It's probably the people my brother sent to protect us.\"\n\nFeng Nü shook her head. \"No, I can clearly sense the people your brother sent. But it's like a pair of eyes in the sky is watching us. I can vaguely feel it, but I can't pinpoint it.\"\n\nNian Bing paused, then said, \"Don't overthink it. We're leaving here the day after tomorrow anyway. Perhaps what you're sensing are the masters my brother sent. You saw that day, two Martial Saints were protecting Yi Nuo. The Hua Rong Empire is the strongest nation on the continent, and the Rong family is the Hua Rong Empire's foremost aristocratic family. The people they send naturally have some skill.\"\n\n\"I hope so. I wonder how Elder Feng Kong and my clansmen are doing.\"\n\n\"It's late. Go to sleep early. Feng Nü, the finals are tomorrow. Tonight, I want to hold you while I sleep, is that okay? Don't worry. I won't do anything improper.\"\n\nFeng Nü's pretty face flushed red, and she nodded gently. With their departure imminent, she truly couldn't bear to refuse Nian Bing's request.\n\nNian Bing cheered, picked up Feng Nü, carefully placed her on the bed, quickly shed his outer clothes, and lay beside her. Embracing her supple body, with the alluring fragrance drifting to his nose, his heart was filled with contentment. At this moment, Nian Bing had no distracting thoughts. He deeply felt that Feng Nü belonged entirely to him, and simply holding her like this was enough. At first, Feng Nü was a little flustered; she felt a bit of fear in her heart, yet also a hint of anticipation. As Nian Bing's faint snores gradually began, she couldn't help but feel a little disappointed in her heart. Looking up at the man embracing her, she clearly felt how real that warm embrace was. In these past days, Nian Bing's cherished affection for her had allowed her to fully experience the magic of love. The mere thought of separation brought an inexplicable pain to her heart. She hugged Nian Bing tightly, lightly kissed his lips, and carrying various complex emotions, Feng Nü gradually fell asleep as well.\n\nThe finals of the Five Nations Young Magic Masters Competition finally began. Today would be the ultimate battle, and both finalists represented the Bingyue Empire.\n\nStanding on the competition stage, Nian Bing clearly felt the heavy atmosphere today. Bing Yun, standing before him, was watching him with cold eyes.\n\n\"At your age, you are already very strong. Unfortunately, without an innate domain, you simply cannot contend with me,\" Bing Yun said blandly.\n\nNian Bing nodded in deep agreement. \"Indeed, I cannot compare to your innate domain. In terms of overall strength, you are much stronger than me.\"\n\nBing Yun's eyes flashed. \"Since we already know the outcome, why bother fighting? After all, we both come from the Bingyue Empire. Even if we're not representing the nation, it would be good to save some strength. The road back might not be peaceful.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"What the road back is like, that's a matter for after tomorrow. Make me concede? You can, as long as you tell me where my parents are imprisoned in the Ice God Tower and give me a detailed map. I'll surrender immediately without another word.\"\n\nBing Yun's brow furrowed slightly. \"Are you dreaming? If so, then I have no choice but to defeat you.\"\n\nRong Fei, standing by, said, \"Today is the final. The rules remain the same: no use of magic scrolls. Begin the match!\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" Nian Bing said.\n\nRong Fei paused, then said, \"Is there something else?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"You are the referee, but I hope you don't stay on the competition stage. Otherwise, it would be bad if you were accidentally injured.\"\n\nA flicker of anger flashed in Rong Fei's eyes. \"If you two can injure me, then I wouldn't be fit to be the referee for this competition, *hng*.\" Having said that, he still retreated to the edge of the competition stage.\n\nA hint of disdain showed in Nian Bing's eyes. He had already warned him; if Rong Fei didn't want to step down, that was his business.\n\nA cold aura emanated from around Qianhuan Bingyun's body. A white halo floated up, encroaching in all directions. She had absolutely no contempt for Nian Bing, especially after witnessing the formidable offensive power of his ice and fire of the same origin magic. Therefore, she immediately used her Ice and Snow Goddess Domain.\n\nA solemn expression appeared on Nian Bing's face. Suddenly, he did something that surprised everyone present: he took off his clothes. With the red magic robe removed, he was left only in white undergarments. When Bing Yun saw Nian Bing suddenly undress, a flicker of panic immediately appeared in her eyes, and the innate domain she was releasing couldn't help but slow down.\n\nNian Bing chuckled. His discarded magic robe floated flat onto the ground. His left hand instantly swept out, and red and blue lights simultaneously shone. The Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess and the Roar of the Flame God flew out at the same time, pinning the magic robe to the ground. The lights flashed again, and golden, silver, black, and azure lights fell around the magic robe, \"Ice, you are the symbol of coldness; Fire, you are the source of heat. Oh, auras of ice and fire, please allow me to merge your properties. Guided by your common origin, resonate!\" The Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess and the Stone of the Flame God simultaneously emitted exceptionally dazzling radiance. The magic robe pinned to the ground surprisingly developed golden patterns—it was a magic array, an exceptionally complex one. The magic array seemed alive. At its central core, a ball of intertwined red and blue light rose, pulsing and flickering continuously. Suddenly, the surrounding world seemed to change. The red and blue vanished simultaneously, and everything became dim.\n\nBing Yun's entire body suddenly trembled. Her innate domain, which she had been releasing, instantly withered. The white halo vanished without warning. The veil on her face rippled slightly, her body suddenly slumped, and a bewildered expression filled her eyes. She had no idea what had happened. Nian Bing was clearly prepared; his body swayed, and as his twin blades flew out, he immediately sat cross-legged on the ground, his brows deeply furrowed. However, his situation was much better than Bing Yun's. The unluckiest was Rong Fei. Despite Nian Bing's warning, he remained on the competition stage and also fell to the ground, a pained expression in his eyes.\n\nThe magic array on the ground had now transformed into a faint purple. Every magic symbol within it slowly rotated around the array, and the world seen through Nian Bing's and Bing Yun's eyes had also completely turned purple. Everything was so real, yet so illusory.\n\nNian Bing breathed lightly, large drops of sweat falling. Although in extreme pain, an excited smile appeared on his face. He had experienced a similar situation once before, so he wasn't surprised. He steadied his mind and calmly looked at Bing Yun, who was not far ahead.\n\n\"You, what did you do?\" Bing Yun struggled to sit up. However, no matter how hard she tried, her spiritual power had already been completely drained.\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath; he had already adapted to the feeling of losing spiritual power. \"It seems I gambled correctly. Although an innate domain is powerful, it still requires spiritual power to manifest. Without spiritual power, your innate domain naturally loses its ability. Your magic power and mine are not far apart. Now, you've lost your reliance. Without spiritual power, I'm afraid your Thousand Illusions Domain can't be used either, can it? We're on the same starting line. To achieve final victory, it will depend on each other's abilities. Defeating the opponent without harming oneself is not easy.\"\n\nThe dizziness in her mind continuously stimulated Bing Yun. Her consciousness was hazy at this moment. Since she began cultivating magic, this was the first time she had experienced such a situation. For a magic master, without spiritual power, it was like not having a hand to wield a sharp sword. Although magic power was strong, to defeat an opponent now, only large-area magic spells could be used.\n\nNian Bing glanced at the Fire Cloud Barrier surrounding the competition stage. The cultivation of a hundred Arch Mages was indeed formidable. The forbidden spell he cast should have covered a slightly larger area than the competition stage, but it was forcibly suppressed by the Fire Cloud Barrier. Nian Bing did not attack Bing Yun but instead walked step by step to Rong Fei's side, lifted a leg, and kicked him off the stage. One must know that in this forbidden magic array, the stronger one's spiritual power, the more painful the sensation of being drained. This was also why Nian Bing was able to defeat Xi La De with this magic array back then. At this moment, Rong Fei was still immersed in pain.\n\nBing Yun struggled to stand, her body swaying slightly. She wanted to summon the magic artifacts from her spatial item, but without spiritual power, she couldn't even perform the simplest retrieval summons.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"What's wrong, not used to it? Don't force yourself. If I were you, I would concede now. When I activated the magic array, I had already retrieved my strongest magic blades. With them, I can completely establish a powerful defensive system and then unleash large-area offensive magic without any chance of harming myself. As for you, I'm afraid you won't be so lucky.\"\n\nBing Yun looked coldly at Nian Bing. \"Despicable. In a fair competition, you actually used such a method to achieve your goal. Even if you win, it won't prove anything.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled. \"I only pursue the outcome, not the process. A fair competition? Is it fair for a magic master with an innate domain to face one without? What's despicable about that? To survive, I'm willing to use any means. Besides, no matter how despicable I am, I haven't violated the competition rules. I didn't use a scroll; this was just my clothes. You can interpret it as a magic item. Isn't your Ice God Tower synonymous with 'despicable'? Otherwise, how could you have threatened me with my parents' lives? Qianhuan Bingyun, frankly speaking, in terms of individual strength alone, you are indeed above me. However, if this weren't a competition, you might not necessarily be able to defeat me. I have at least a seventy percent chance of defeating you.\"\n\nBing Yun sneered. \"What's the use of saying all this now? This is our first battle, but it will certainly not be the last. Go ahead and make your move. Do you think I can't defeat you without a magic staff? Eternal ice! Please allow me to summon your aura, summon your tenacity, your coldness, your aloofness, to transform into a Wall of Eternal Ice, to block all evil attacks. Barrier of Ice!\" Cold blue condensed within the incantation. Although there was no spiritual power to control it, the magic still unleashed its inherent power. Blue light rose from the ground, actually sectioning off the entire competition stage. It connected with the Fire Cloud Barrier around it, forming a massive wall of ice.\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly. \"Miss Bing Yun, you must remember that the magic array I'm currently using is called: Eternal Slumber.\"\n\nBing Yun said nothing. She began rapidly chanting spells. Without the advantage of her innate domain, defeating Nian Bing could only rely on offensive magic.\n\n\"Whisper of the Free Wind.\"\n\n\"Ever-Changing Hexagram of Divine Mechanism.\"\n\n\"Dawn Piercing Heaven and Earth.\"\n\n\"Curse of Eternal Hell.\"\n\n\"Darkness, Light, Space, Wind, under the effects of curse, transformation, sanctity, and swiftness, based on the ice and fire of the same origin, release your auras!\"\n\nAzure, silver, white, and black lights simultaneously shone forth. On the competition stage, one could almost hear the cheering of the magic elements—such was the effect of top-tier gems. Aotian Blade, Xuanji Blade, Shengyao Blade, and Shimó Blade orbited around the Eternal Slumber magic array, using the ice and fire of the same origin aura within the array to release a four-colored misty light barrier, perfectly enveloping Nian Bing.\n\nA blizzard appeared outside the Barrier of Ice. The temperature on the competition stage continuously dropped. The blade-like snowflakes, driven by the strong wind, continuously cut at every corner of the stage like tiny blades. The Barrier of Ice emitted faint hissing sounds as the snowflakes sliced at it.\n\nNian Bing looked at the dancing snowflakes and smiled faintly. He knew very well that the reason Bing Yun was called \"Thousand Illusions\" was because she could use powerful spiritual power to control ice magic and conjure countless miraculous forms. The reason he chose the forbidden magic array \"Eternal Slumber\" was precisely because, without the support of spiritual power, she had lost her magic variations.",

    "content": "However, he himself was not like this. His mental power was equally strong, and his magical variations were absolutely no less than Bing Yun's. But his magical variations did not solely rely on mental power; more importantly, they relied on Mimicry Magic. Even without using mental power to control them, the power produced by the transformations of various magic elements was equally peculiar. Back then, after his battle with Shirard, Nian Bing had been researching how to exert his strength while in Eternal Slumber. Through his continuous exploration and cultivation, he finally found a method. Although this method could not restore his mental power, at least his attacks would no longer backfire. That was the Mimicry Four-Element Pivot Magic Array before him. The clothing he threw out not only contained an Eternal Slumber magic array, but also had some auxiliary magic arrays drawn along its edges. The greatest characteristic of these arrays was that they drew upon the powers of darkness, light, space, and wind, forming a super auxiliary barrier. Within this barrier, it was much easier for Nian Bing to use these four types of magic. Furthermore, any magic he cast would naturally dissipate upon contact with the energy range of this Mimicry Four-Element Pivot Magic Array. While in Eternal Slumber, this was undoubtedly an excellent barrier.\n\n\"Infinite darkness transforms into an endless curse, corroding all things in the world, disintegrating all things in the world, unleash your destructive demonic grasp, fill the heavens and earth. Corrosive Mist.\" This incantation was one Nian Bing had recently acquired, and he took the opportunity to test it out. The light from the Four-Element Pivot Magic Array suddenly dimmed. Under the control of the magic array at the edge of the magic robe, the four magic elements underwent a marvelous transformation. The aura of light converged to the innermost layer; connected to light was a profound silver; next was the azure wind; and on the outermost was the aura of darkness. It was precisely due to the outward emission of darkness that the entire magic array appeared much dimmer.\n\nThe blizzard had arrived. Black mist simultaneously rose. The moment the pristine blizzard came into contact with the black mist, there was an instant flurry of popping sounds. Snowflakes instantly vanished as the mist spread. Nian Bing continuously urged his magic power to enhance the effect of the Corrosive Mist. This large-area Corrosive Mist was perfectly suited to counter large-area snowflakes, even more effective than cannon magic.\n\nIn the stands, Emperor Huatian's eyes flashed with a sharp gleam. He was not displeased by Nian Bing's use of dark magic. Instead, a strange smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. His gaze met Prince Rong's, and he gave a slight nod. Prince Rong smiled faintly. He knew that Emperor Huatian had now truly accepted Nian Bing.\n\nThe snowflakes vanished, and the entire competition stage was filled with surging mist. Unfortunately, though the Corrosive Mist was powerful, it was impossible for it to break through the Ice Barrier. Under the effect of corrosion, the Ice Barrier continuously emitted unpleasant sounds, but only honeycomb-like corrosive marks appeared on it. The degree of corrosion was far from enough to make this eighth-tier defensive magic collapse.\n\nJust as Bing Yun was switching to another incantation, Nian Bing's magic already followed in quick succession. Thanks to the effect of the Four-Element Pivot Magic Array, his magic casting speed was astonishingly fast. When chanting incantations, he no longer needed that special intonation; the array's amplification completely unified him with the four elements. As the black mist gradually faded, and Bing Yun could once again see Nian Bing's situation through the ice wall, she was astonished to find countless wind blades coming straight at her. Cutting sounds and shattering sounds continuously rang out. Ice powder splashed, and clumps of mist erupted. The Ice Barrier was no longer so sturdy.\n\nAt the same time, a golden light suddenly burst forth. Countless golden light points began to condense on the competition stage. It was clear that the next wave of attack was imminent. The two previous spells Nian Bing used were only sixth-tier in power, but their true strength lay in their speed. First, the corrosion of darkness, then the baptism of wind. Finally, once this illumination of light arrived, after the impact of both dark and light elements, the Ice Barrier would have no more capacity to resist.\n\nBing Yun spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, staining her veil red. The blue ice flower on her chest suddenly shone brightly. Her beautiful eyes revealed endless coldness as she suppressed the weakness in her mental power and took a step forward. Immediately after, her movements quickened. She took step after step, her figure dancing gracefully, actually dancing behind the Ice Barrier. With each step, a melodious note would emerge from her mouth, like an accompanying piece of music, setting off her peerless beauty, like a proud plum blossom blooming in a world of ice and snow.\n\nCountless light points descended. The golden light first quietly fell upon the Ice Barrier. Immediately after, amidst the dazzling golden light, the Ice Barrier suddenly transformed into a large expanse of ice mist and vanished. As soon as the ice mist disappeared, Bing Yun actually passed through it and drifted out. Only then did Nian Bing clearly see her graceful dance. Circles of faint blue light, like flames, ascended around her delicate body. Although her every step appeared somewhat faltering, linked together they were still so captivating.\n\nNian Bing had no mood for appreciation at this moment. Seeing the scene before him, his heart was involuntarily filled with awe. The secret techniques of the Ice God Tower were by no means simple. He dared not be careless in the slightest and immediately released the next spell. Silver light appeared on the outermost layer of the Four-Element Pivot Array. Under the effect of the faint silver, reality gradually became distorted. Although Nian Bing's Four-Element Pivot Magic Array had decent power, without mental power, he could only use extremely mana-intensive large-area attack spells to ensure hitting his opponent. Furthermore, because these four types of magic were Mimicry Magic, and now they also needed to generate defensive capabilities to protect Nian Bing, he could currently only cast sixth-tier large-area attack spells. Otherwise, if he could use stronger magic, he would have acted long ago.\n\nThe distortion of space became increasingly intense. Time and space seemed to solidify at that moment. Bing Yun's figure in the twisted space had become less real; some areas instantly expanded, some contracted, and in some places, even the air had been evacuated. This space-element attack magic was extremely powerful, but due to its equally great limitations, not many people used it.\n\nThe shattered space formed countless invisible tearing blades, cutting at Bing Yun's body. The distorted light secretly shocked the spectators below. Nian Bing had consecutively used four sixth-tier large-area attack spells, yet he seemed not to have consumed much magic power. Moreover, this was under circumstances where the spectators below did not understand how powerful Eternal Slumber truly was. Although this forbidden array was not as effective for ordinary mages as it was for mental mages, the feeling of suddenly having one's mental power drained was not something ordinary people could endure. A mage with weaker willpower would have already fainted. Yet, Bing Yun and Nian Bing were still fighting. When the distorted space came into contact with the blue light flames on Bing Yun's body, it seemed to somewhat shrink, only slowing her moving steps slightly, but it could not stop her actions.\n\nBing Yun's speed was very slow, but Nian Bing had already discovered the problem. Because, the Bing Yun before him was getting bigger and bigger in his eyes; her direction of movement was precisely towards him. Nian Bing's heart stirred. Could she use martial arts? Did she want to defeat him in close combat? No, that's impossible! This is a competition. If she used martial arts, it would be equivalent to her conceding. Moreover, how could a disciple of the Ice God Tower possibly possess martial arts? Just as Nian Bing was pondering, Bing Yun's movement speed suddenly increased. The blue light flames seemed to instantly merge into her skin. Her figure was like a sharp sword, breaking through the distorted spatial barrier, leaving a trail of afterimages behind her. In the blink of an eye, she had already rushed in front of Nian Bing. The blue light flames instantly appeared, and Bing Yun's eyes were filled with fatigue.\n\nAt this very moment, Nian Bing suddenly understood. How could Bing Yun know any martial arts? The previous charge was clearly an application of magic. Her goal was very simple: the Eternal Slumber magic array in front of him! The Four-Element Pivot Magic Array he released could only neutralize the power generated by his own magic, having no resistance whatsoever against external attacks. Bing Yun's sudden physical charge disturbed Nian Bing's mind. It was too late to release another spell now. If Bing Yun destroyed his magic array... Once her innate domain erupted, he, with his mental power still unrecovered, would have no chance of resisting at all. Various thoughts flashed through Nian Bing's mind like lightning. Without any hesitation, he rushed out. At this moment, the blue light flames emanating from Bing Yun's body had already reached the front of the magic array.\n\nA fiery red aura instantly erupted from Nian Bing's body. Scorching flames burned around him. With a lunge, leveraging his physical advantage, he violently charged into the light flames. Instantly, Nian Bing and Bing Yun both jolted violently. What they were burning was the magic power within their own bodies. The pain generated when ice and fire met caused them both to tremble. Under the effect of inertia, Nian Bing had already surged past the blue light flames. The flames around his body and the ice flames disappeared simultaneously, but the intense light produced in that instant temporarily blinded both of them. Nian Bing had originally intended to strike Bing Yun directly with his right fist. However, the severe pain from within his body caused his forward-charging body to lose balance. Subconsciously, he changed his fist to a palm, trying to grab something to stabilize himself.\n\nBing Yun's injuries from Nian Bing's impact were much greater than Nian Bing's. After all, Nian Bing was an ice-fire dual-origin mage, possessing an innate strong resistance to the aura of ice. However, Bing Yun did not possess this ability. At this moment, the strong dizziness and severe pain within her body made her involuntarily spit out another mouthful of blood. Just as her consciousness was blurring, she suddenly felt something scorching collide with her. Her chest tightened. A strange heat surged into her body from a sensitive area. Bing Yun's entire body went limp, and under the force of the impact, she instantly fell backward.\n\nNian Bing changed his fist to a palm, and his subconscious movement actually grabbed something. He grabbed a mass of something elastic. He originally wanted to grip it tightly to stabilize his body, but then he realized that mass was also falling backward, and his body tilted forward with it. Subconsciously, he extended his other hand as well, and surprisingly, also grabbed a full, ample mass. He twisted his body, intending to stabilize himself, but unexpectedly, he ended up as the cushion. With a thud, a strong tremor came from his back, followed by a heavy weight pressing down on him. Especially those two masses of elastic softness, they were tightly pressed against his hands. An orchid-like fragrance wafted into his nose. The faint fragrance and icy aura instantly cleared Nian Bing's mind. Subconsciously, he squeezed those two soft masses again, but then he heard a captivating moan, and was instantly startled.\n\nHis vision finally recovered. Nian Bing and Bing Yun were in an extremely ambiguous posture. Nian Bing lay flat on the competition stage, while Bing Yun was pressed on top of him. Nian Bing's hands, at this moment, were gripping Bing Yun's towering breasts. Both of them were stunned. How could such a situation have been anticipated by them? Everything before had happened extremely fast, coupled with the dazzling light. At this moment, apart from themselves, no one understood exactly what had transpired. The veil on Bing Yun's face had disappeared. Her originally floor-length blue hair cascaded down like a waterfall, perfectly covering her and Nian Bing's bodies. Their four eyes met. Nian Bing's heart pounded violently. Bing Yun's face was now only an inch away from his, and her exquisitely beautiful face was filled with an astonished expression. Bing Yun's beauty was one of cool elegance. Among all the women Nian Bing had seen, only Feng Nü and Yu Ruyan could barely compare to her. Feng Nü possessed more arousing gentleness but lacked the cool allure. Nian Bing suddenly realized their eyes were very similar: that sky-blue color was so clear, without a single impurity.\n\nAwkwardly looking at Bing Yun, Nian Bing maintained his previous posture and muttered, \"Could this be the legendary Breast-Grabbing Dragon Claw Hand? The elasticity is really good.\"\n\n\"You----bas----tard-----\" A drop of water fell on Nian Bing's face. The water was so cold.",

    "content": "Bingyun struggled to stand, her eyes filled with fury and killing intent. Innumerable blue elements were released around her body, surging madly towards Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing was startled. He rolled on the ground, barely managing to stand, red energy currents rising around his body, barely resisting Bingyun's attack. \"Hey, I didn't do it on purpose.\"\n\n\"I'll kill you.\" Bingyun's beautiful face was slightly contorted, her eyes bloodshot, like a mother lion ready to devour someone. Bingyun's aura continuously rose, and she began to chant the strongest spell she could release. \"Are you crazy?\" As soon as Nian Bing heard Bingyun's spell, he knew something was wrong. If she truly unleashed it, not only would he die, but Bingyun would probably be finished too. Nian Bing didn't cherish Bingyun's life, but at this moment, he absolutely didn't want her to die like this. His parents' whereabouts still needed to be found from her. Without any hesitation, he pounced on Bingyun again. He had to interrupt this spell.\n\nSeveral ice cones instantly shot out. Unfortunately, without mental power control, the ice cones' attack directions were scattered; only one flew out from the front, charging towards Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing no longer cared about dodging. He turned his body to avoid a vital spot, grabbed Bingyun's shoulder, and covered her mouth with his other hand.\n\nThe ice cone accurately pierced Nian Bing's shoulder, but without mental power control, it didn't pierce deeply. The pain in his hand followed closely after his shoulder. Nian Bing cried out in pain, \"Why are you biting me?\"\n\nThe spell was interrupted. Nian Bing promptly picked up the Aotian Blade from the ground and held it against Bingyun's neck, enduring the pain in his shoulder and hand as he said, \"Just give up. Is there any point in fighting further?\"\n\nTears streamed down Bingyun's pretty face. From childhood, even the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had treated her like a pearl in the palm of their hand*. When had her pure body ever suffered such humiliation? How could she endure it? She suddenly closed her eyes, and her neck actually moved towards the Aotian Blade.\n\nNian Bing, having practiced cooking for many years, had incredibly fast hand reactions. As soon as he saw something was wrong, he immediately pulled back his Aotian Blade, raised his hand, and struck Bingyun's neck, knocking her unconscious. \"Damn it, what a crazy woman.\" The entire competition finally concluded. The dramatic ending left the crowd dumbfounded; no one could have imagined that two powerful magicians would end their battle in such a way.\n\nNian Bing gently laid Bingyun's body on the ground and quickly deactivated the magic array on the floor. His mental power began to gradually recover. He first cast a healing spell on himself, which made him feel a bit more comfortable.\n\nHe strode to the side of the viewing platform. He bowed slightly and said to Huatian Emperor, \"Your Majesty, the competition has ended. I believe I should be the champion of this event.\"\n\nA hint of a smile appeared in Huatian Emperor's eyes. \"Good. The Five Nations' Rising Star Magician Competition concludes now. The champion is Magician Nian Bing, representing the Bingyue Empire Magicians' Guild. I issue my command: Announce the rankings of this competition to the world. Rong Prince, please present the championship prize to Magician Nian Bing.\"\n\nA rare smile appeared on Rong Prince's face. He took the brocade box from a palace guard beside him and nodded at Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing felt a sense of relief. He strode down the competition stage and approached Rong Prince. Rong Prince handed the brocade box to him. \"Congratulations on winning the championship. From now on, you are the master of this Changsheng Blade. The Changsheng Blade requires blood to be unsealed. I believe you understand this principle.\"\n\nAfter Nian Bing bowed to Rong Prince, he put the brocade box into his Spatial Ring. \"Thank you, Rong Prince.\"\n\nHuatian Emperor said, \"Alright, this competition has concluded. Tonight, a banquet will be held in this imperial palace to entertain the magicians from various nations, and I will also award the prize money I previously promised. Everyone, you may now go and rest.\"\n\nRong Prince walked with Nian Bing out of the Trial Hall. As they walked, Nian Bing quietly asked, \"Brother, when did that Bingyun leave? How come I didn't know?\" It turned out that after he received the Changsheng Blade, when he turned around to look for Bingyun, he found that her figure had already disappeared.\n\nRong Prince chuckled, \"You really are something. You even came up with such a nasty method. But that magic array you drew was truly miraculous; it could even break an Innate Domain. Bingyun woke up just as you stepped off the stage to receive your award. She seemed to glare fiercely at you, then left the Trial Hall without looking back. Oh, right, what did you do when the two of you were down on the stage? It's not easy to make someone from the Ice God Tower that furious!\"\n\nNian Bing's face revealed a wry smile. \"A misunderstanding, it was just a misunderstanding.\"\n\n\"Rong Prince.\" A familiar voice sounded. When the two brothers turned to look, they saw Yinuo eagerly running over. She first smiled slightly at Nian Bing and said, \"Congratulations, you won the championship this time.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Sister-in-law, this was Big Brother letting me have it! Otherwise, how would it be my turn to be champion?\"\n\nYinuo snorted. \"Stop with that. This girl isn't blind. But even if our Rong Prince's magic isn't as good as yours, so what? Rong Prince, tell me, are you being transferred out?\"\n\nRong Prince looked at her in surprise and said, \"How did you know?\" As soon as the words left his mouth, he instantly realized, but it was too late to retract them.\n\nYinuo's eyes reddened. She pouted, \"You don't want me anymore?\"\n\nRong Prince frowned slightly and said, \"What does that have to do with whether I want you or not? Our marriage was granted by His Majesty; how could I go against it? This transfer is just to gain more experience.\"\n\nAnger surged in Yinuo's eyes. \"Are you saying that if it weren't for my grandfather's command, you wouldn't have married me at all? Fine, Rong Prince, mark my words.\" After saying that, she turned and left.\n\nRong Prince paused, then scoffed, \"Nonsensical. Women are truly fickle.\"\n\nNian Bing patted Rong Prince's shoulder and said, \"Go after her quickly. Just coax her and it'll be fine. Women need to be coaxed, you know. Don't always be so cold to Sister-in-law; after all, you'll be spending your whole life together. I'm also going back to see Feng Nü. We'll see each other again at the imperial palace banquet tonight.\" With that, he left Rong Prince alone and walked away. The matters here were concluded, and it was time to fulfill Yu Ruyan's command.\n\nHe walked out of the imperial palace and entered the bustling streets. Taking a deep breath, he felt much lighter. He glanced back at the imperial palace. Regardless of whether Feng Nü was Yu Ruyan's daughter, he would not attend tonight's banquet. It was time to leave this place. He would certainly fulfill his promise to Rong Prince, but he didn't want to stay here any longer. From the way Huatian Emperor looked at him, Nian Bing had understood many things. What he needed was freedom, not to serve any nation. Last night, Rong Prince had asked him if he was willing to serve the Huana Empire. Nian Bing refused. Rong Prince didn't say much, only making Nian Bing memorize all his final magic insights before giving him a few items. Although Rong Prince didn't say much, Nian Bing understood his meaning.\n\nThinking of leaving this bustling city, Nian Bing's heart couldn't help but feel much lighter. Now, his only worry was Feng Nü. If Feng Nü really was Yu Ruyan's daughter, could she withstand such a drastic change?\n\nReturning to the inn, where he had stayed for some time, the inn's service staff already recognized him. He greeted a staff member and walked towards his room. Just as he reached the door, Nian Bing immediately realized something was wrong because the door was ajar, leaving a gap. Although he and Feng Nü didn't lock the door except at night, they also didn't have a habit of not closing it. A wave of unease swept through him, and he hurriedly pushed the door open.\n\nThe room was empty; Feng Nü was not there. Nian Bing's heart tightened. Just as he thought of going outside to ask the service staff, he found a piece of paper on the room's table.\n\nNian Bing snatched the paper. He saw a few lines of crooked writing on it, clearly not Feng Nü's handwriting: \"Kid, your name is Nian Bing, right? If you want your wife to live, exit the city from the North Gate, walk straight north. After about ten *li*¹, you'll see a dense forest by the road. Go through the forest, and there's a mountain. I'll be waiting for you at the foot of the mountain. I know you're someone from the Rong family, but if you bring people, you'll probably only see your wife's corpse.\"\n\nDamn it. Nian Bing had never felt such rage. His mind was a tangled mess², and he forcefully tore the paper in his hand into pieces, his eyes continuously flickering with complex light.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Nian Bing tried his best to calm down. In such a situation, impatience was useless. He pulled up a chair and sat down, recalling the contents of the paper. He immediately determined that the other party was definitely not Feng Nü's clan member. If Elder Feng Kong had taken Feng Nü, she would never have left him a message. Moreover, to so easily abduct a Martial Saint-level Feng Nü, among the people he knew, perhaps only his godmother Yu Ruyan and Fire Dragon King Garomandis could do it. But how could Yu Ruyan be here? She was still too busy with matters in the Aolan Empire.\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel secretly alarmed. Who exactly was this person who abducted Feng Nü? In terms of strength, he was even inferior to Feng Nü. The abductor's goal seemed to be him. Could it be, could it be for his several excellent magic blades?\n\nAt this thought, Nian Bing immediately thought of the contestants from various nations in this competition. Only they had seen his treasures. Indeed, these priceless items could easily arouse others' covetous hearts³. His mind continuously analyzed various possibilities, but the more he thought, the more chaotic his mind became. He didn't care. No matter what, he absolutely had to go save Feng Nü, even if it meant braving a mountain of blades and a sea of fire⁴. Even if the other party's intention was his precious blades, for Feng Nü's sake, he would have no choice but to hand them over.\n\nWith this thought, Nian Bing retrieved the brocade box containing the Changsheng Blade from his Spatial Ring. He first cast a seal in the room before opening the box. Under the effect of the seal, the blade's light was noticeably less intense, but the abundant life aura still made Nian Bing's whole body tremble. He didn't rush to take the blade out of the box. He bit his finger and carefully dripped blood onto the yellow gem on the hilt.\n\nThe blood instantly merged into the gem. With a faint hum, the Changsheng Blade actually floated out of the brocade box, its yellow halo pulsating regularly. A life aura, stronger with each surge, swept over Nian Bing's body, carrying a fresh scent.\n\nClosing his eyes, Nian Bing used his heart to feel this peerless treasured blade, allowing the life aura to nourish his body. It was truly a wondrous sensation. The life aura sweeping through his entire body continuously surged, every pore on his skin seemingly opening to madly absorb the vast life force brought by the Changsheng Blade.\n\nThis was a process of fusion. Previously, each time he obtained a treasured blade, he had to go through such a process, but the time and experience of each process were completely different. Among the previous magic blades, the most memorable for Nian Bing was naturally the Shengyao Blade that had pierced through his chest, though that memory only brought pain. But the aura brought by the Changsheng Blade as it fused with his body was so wondrous. Under the effect of the life aura, his bodily functions grew wildly. The Tianhua Plate on his chest became scorching hot. The red and blue masses of magic power within him were enveloped by a layer of yellow light, and the large amounts of magic power and physical strength he had lost due to the competition were rapidly recovering. Even his mental power continuously soared within this life aura, approaching its optimal state.\n\nA flash of inspiration passed through his mind. Nian Bing seemed to understand something. With a gesture of both hands, the Chenlu Blade and Zhengyang Blade first appeared in his hands. He stood up, and amidst flickering light, the two blades each outlined a triangular halo, forming an Ice and Fire Co-source Hexagram Seal on the ground. Nian Bing inserted Chenlu and Zhengyang into the center of the hexagram, then continuously summoned magic blade after magic blade from his Spatial Ring.\n\nThe entire room was filled with a magical aura. One could even hear the excited chirping of various magical elements. Dense magical elements continuously cleansed Nian Bing's body. He stood before Chenlu and Zhengyang, allowing the magic blades to absorb their respective elements. Halos of light nourished his body, and the Ice and Fire Co-source magic power within him rapidly recovered. At this moment, his mind was exceptionally clear. Although his eyes were closed, he could clearly feel everything happening around his body.\n\nWith a slight smile, Nian Bing suddenly opened his eyes, a strong cold glint appearing in them. At this moment, the Shengyao Blade, Shimochou Blade, Aotian Blade, and Xuanji Blade were all inserted around the magic array. Six-colored lights shimmered alternately, yet they repelled the light released by the Changsheng Blade in the air.\n\n---\n¹ **li**: A traditional Chinese unit of distance, approximately 0.5 kilometers or 0.3 miles.\n² **tangled mess**: Literally \"a tangled ball of hemp,\" meaning utterly confused or chaotic.\n³ **covetous hearts**: Literally \"heart of covetousness,\" meaning a desire to possess something belonging to another.\n⁴ **mountain of blades and a sea of fire**: An idiom describing extremely dangerous and perilous circumstances.",

    "content": "Extending his resolute right hand, Nian Bing gripped the hilt of the Longevity Blade. The yellow gem on the hilt suddenly flared brightly, and an exceptionally potent life aura surged forth, sweeping over Nian Bing's body.\n\n\"Ah—\" Nian Bing roared, abruptly reversing the blade's direction, knelt on one knee, and plunged the Longevity Blade into the edge of the hexagram as well.\n\nThe six-colored magic force instantly became seven colors. Simultaneously, the magical aura underwent a dramatic change. Everything in the previously clear room became distorted. Seven-colored light continually intertwined in the air, and Nian Bing's spiritual power also split into seven strands, each merging into one color of light. Seven distinct energies, radiating seven powerful auras, clashed and pressed against each other. With the addition of the life aura to the original six energies, everything changed.\n\nThe ice-fire twin-source magic force within his body surged violently. Originally calm and stagnant in his chest and lower abdomen, they now changed under the influence of the external magical aura. Red and blue lights within Nian Bing's body gradually drew closer, and at this moment, Nian Bing's spiritual power, due to its involuntary dispersal, actually lost control over them.\n\nA sudden realization flashed through him. As an ice-fire twin-source mage, Nian Bing naturally knew what would happen if ice and fire collided without control. With the magic force of such intensity within his body, if it weren't for his own assimilated control, once they touched, let alone one of him, even two or a hundred would likely turn to ashes and vanish.\n\nThinking this, Nian Bing's heart filled with dread. However, he had no way at all to change the current situation. He desperately tried to gather his spiritual power to prevent the collision of ice and fire, but the auras released by the seven magic blades outside his body each tugged at a strand of his spiritual power. The immense suction made it impossible for him to withdraw his spiritual power to save himself.\n\nThe red representing fire and the blue representing ice, as if deliberately tormenting Nian Bing, continued to approach. But their approach was very slow, as if trying to grind down Nian Bing's will with pressure.\n\nNian Bing's focus at this moment was entirely on the ice-fire twin-source magic force within his body, but he didn't realize that outside, the blue and seven-colored magic elements were no longer as chaotic as before. They had begun to rotate, forming a circular, organic composite of seven-colored magic force. The distribution of the halo gradually became uniform, and Nian Bing's body was at the center of this magic element vortex. The entire vortex, driven by the blue and red lights, continuously assailed his body. Nian Bing's clothes unconsciously turned to dust and vanished. To be precise, within a half-zhang (approx. 1.6 meters) diameter, everything disappeared except for the ground protected by the hexagram. The table was eroded into an arc-shaped gap, and a corner of the bed was shaved off by the magic elements.\n\nSweat streamed down Nian Bing's forehead. But it was quickly evaporated. The red and blue light spheres within his body continued to approach each other. The shadow of death encroached upon Nian Bing's mind, but no matter how hard he tried, his body had already entered a sealed state, only able to watch helplessly as the energies constantly drew nearer, without any means to intervene.\n\nThe red and blue lights grew increasingly intense. Nian Bing was already somewhat despairing at this point, unable to conjure any other thoughts in his mind. All he could think of were the words \"death\" and \"die.\" He didn't want to die; too many things awaited him, but in this current situation, what could he do? He could only wait. Wait for his body to perish in the ice-fire explosion.\n\nAs if a hundred years had passed, finally, the red and blue lights were close, only a hair's breadth from colliding. At this moment, Nian Bing's mind was on the verge of collapse, but he continued to desperately call upon his spiritual power, hoping for a miracle.\n\nDid a miracle happen? No. His spiritual power was completely drained outside his body, utterly unable to prevent the arrival of this final moment.\n\nLightning-like ripples appeared around the red and blue light spheres. When the two light spheres came into contact, a strange sensation suddenly arose in Nian Bing's heart. It was neither ice nor fire, but a feeling of nothingness.\n\nSuddenly, a colorless, transparent space appeared, emerging within the two light spheres. It truly was a colorless, transparent space, yet oddly, nothing else could be seen through it. Amidst the strange sensation, the red and blue light spheres seemed to be pulled in by this void-like space. The forms of both light spheres changed; they were no longer spherical, but became fish-like, slowly rotating around that void. No matter how blue and red collided, not a ripple was stirred, as if they were always meant to be one.\n\nBefore Nian Bing could even exhale, his whole body suddenly jolted. He suddenly felt a surge at his glabella. The next moment, surging magic energy had already poured in from his glabella, like all rivers flowing into the sea, directly rushing towards that void-like point between his chest and abdomen.\n\nIf Nian Bing could see outside at this moment, he would be surprised to find that the seven-colored lights originally swirling around his body had all risen, with the tip of the vortex at his glabella. The energy from the entire vortex continuously poured in, and the external energy gradually diminished.\n\nThe void, under the impact of the ribbon-like energy, caused the already swirling ice-fire energies around it to accelerate. Gradually, streaks of light flashed, and the two ice-fire energy masses transformed back into two spheres. However, this time the sensation was no longer that of energy, but of solid entities.\n\nBoth the red and blue light spheres adhered to the central, fingernail-sized void space, rapidly rotating beside it. And around the swirling red and blue light, five points of light gradually appeared, five rotating specks of light. Their colors were, respectively, azure, yellow, silver, gold, and white. These five light spheres were clearly much smaller than the original ice-fire energy spheres, but similarly, they also felt like solid entities.\n\nNian Bing had no idea what was happening. Faced with the strange changes within his body, he was somewhat dazed. Those five small light spheres slowly grew with the continuous influx of external energy, but their rotation speed remained very slow, much slower than the ice and fire energies at the core.\n\nFinally, Nian Bing's body jolted again, and the external energy input finally ceased. He was surprised to find that he could actually see everything outside, not through his eyes, nor through his spiritual power that had returned to his body, but from his glabella, as if he had grown a third eye.\n\nA cool sensation, like a revelation, spread from his glabella. Nian Bing realized. Looking outward from his glabella, everything around him seemed to become clearer. He could even see the textures on objects, and clearly discern the speed and traces of energy fluctuations on his magic blades. It truly was like an eye, a wondrous eye.\n\nJust then, spiritual power swept over his body like a tide, frantically pouring into the void space at the center of the red and blue light masses. At this very moment, Nian Bing's mind fell into a brief blankness, as if everything had vanished.\n\nWhen he regained consciousness, he found that everything had changed. The red and blue solid-like light spheres were in contact, slowly rotating, and the void space in the middle had disappeared. The other five smaller light spheres still slowly revolved around the red and blue light spheres, and Nian Bing had regained the ability to control his body. Just as he thought about getting up, he was suddenly surprised to find something new in his mind. Upon careful examination, he was astonished to see that it was a transparent light sphere, or more precisely, a transparent light sphere formed from the previous void space.\n\nThe glass-like light sphere rested quietly at his glabella, truly like an eye, an eye that could see through everything in the world. Unfortunately, due to the presence of the transparent light sphere, when Nian Bing looked outward through his glabella again, everything appeared distorted and blurry. However, what excited Nian Bing was that he found his mind had become incredibly clear. Various magical data continuously flashed through his mind. Some problems that were previously incomprehensible were now logically solved, and even the process of understanding was clearly imprinted deep in his memory.\n\nSpiritual power seemed to have vanished. However, Nian Bing found that no matter which magic element, as long as he casually thought of it, he would immediately feel a blood-and-flesh connection. Especially the transparent sphere at his glabella, it would emit a faint glow whenever he wanted to control magic force. Nian Bing boldly hypothesized, could this transparent sphere be the solidified form of his spiritual power? And what was the reason for his mind being so clear?\n\nSlowly opening his eyes, Nian Bing saw his bare body. He was surprised to find that although he had clearly sweated profusely earlier, his body was now as smooth as an infant's, with healthy pink radiating from his crystal-clear skin. A strange sensation permeated his entire body. With a thought, his body actually floated up from the ground. At this very moment, all he could think of were four words: a complete transformation.\n\nThe seven magic blades were still plunged there, but the seven-colored gems on their hilts all appeared somewhat dim in color. Nian Bing raised his left hand, just about to put them into his spatial ring, when he was surprised to find that his spatial ring had undergone another change. The silver ring had become transparent, like crystal. The entire ring seemed to have grown onto his hand. The moment he had a thought, the seven blades on the ground vanished simultaneously, and he clearly felt that all seven magic blades had been stored within the ring. With a slight movement of his palm, the crystal-like ring shone with seven-colored light. Although not very noticeable, the dazzling sensation still left a deep impression on Nian Bing.\n\nWhat was this? What exactly had happened? Nian Bing was somewhat bewildered, but he vaguely sensed that his ice-fire twin-source magic seemed to have advanced. With a thought, he raised his right hand, and a wind blade quietly appeared. The azure wind blade was so clear, and with a flick of his finger, it had imprinted itself deeply into the wall, leaving a profound mark.\n\nThe joy in his heart was hard to conceal. Without the Proud Sky Blade, he had actually cast wind-element magic! Although it was only an instant cast of a second-tier wind blade, this was a good start! No matter what happened, his strength had definitely increased. Without using a magic blade, he could actually cast wind-element magic. Could he really have become an all-elemental mage? Thinking this, Nian Bing successively experimented with several spells. Just as he expected, all seven elemental magics were displayed one by one in his hands. However, when he instantly used ice and fire magic, the feeling was entirely different. Not only was it a magic force with a blood-and-flesh connection, but also, in terms of power and sense of control, it was much stronger than the other five elements of magic.\n\nHis clear mind accurately helped Nian Bing analyze the core problem. He vaguely understood that it was precisely his ice-fire twin-source magic force, stimulated by the gathering of all elemental magic blades, that had undergone the current mutation. Although he could now use all seven elemental magics, fundamentally, he was still an ice-fire twin-source mage. Ice and fire were his roots, while the other five elements of magic were built upon this foundation. Although the seven solid-like magic entities were very small, they were interconnected, and everything originated from and concluded with the ice-fire twin-source magic force.\n\nAt the same time, Nian Bing also understood that his strength had not essentially increased, but rather, his energy form had changed, paving the way for his continued cultivation. It was like his internal magic force had originally been a small stream, already filled with magic force. Now, the water in the stream had changed, condensed into a solid, and the previously narrow riverbed had now become a vast ocean. The benefits for his continued development were undoubtedly enormous. The only thing Nian Bing didn't understand was the current form of his spiritual power. He could only feel that his spirit had condensed into the transparent sphere at his glabella, but the sensation of spiritual power was not as profound as before. In controlling magic, it seemed to be less easy than before.\n\nHaving sorted all this out, Nian Bing smiled. He was very clear that the mutation of his internal magic force today was by no means simply luck. More importantly, it was the benefit brought by his long-term cultivation. When quantitative changes reached a certain degree, qualitative changes would naturally occur, and today he had undergone a process of qualitative change. Although Nian Bing had previously thought that his ice-fire twin-source magic force would undergo a qualitative change someday, he never expected it to come so quickly. He knew that this qualitative change was absolutely inseparable from his seven peerless magic blades; it was they that provided him with sufficient energy to bring about such a transformation.\n\nChanging into a fresh set of clothes, a comfortable sensation spread throughout his body. Everything that had happened to him was over. He immediately thought of Feng Nü. His previously relaxed brows couldn't help but furrow. Should he go ask Rong Bing for help? No, he couldn't trouble his older brother anymore. Furthermore, he didn't want to rely on the Rong family's power for anything. Only relying on himself was the best choice.\n\nThe increase in his strength, coupled with his clear analysis, Nian Bing resolutely left the room. He didn't use the door, because the anxiety in his heart truly made him unable to wait. He didn't use Blizzard; this time, he used the wind-elemental Wind Soaring Spell. He drifted up from the window, soared into the sky in an instant, and headed north.",

    "content": "The Wind Soaring Technique's flight speed wasn't particularly fast, at least not as fast as a Blizzard, but it saved a lot more magical energy, allowing for continuous flight. Feeling the surrounding wind flow, Nian Bing discovered that he seemed to have become a part of the wind. At this moment, a wondrous change also occurred within his body's magical energy. The five magic orbs that originally rotated around the red and blue light clusters had become four. The green one, in particular, had merged into the central Ice-Fire Co-origin Magic Orb, rotating at its core. More wind elements entered his body from the air, and the rate of magical energy consumption was surprisingly slow.\n\nSensing this change, Nian Bing was overjoyed. The Wind Soaring Technique was already an intermediate wind-element magic spell, yet its consumption was so small. This showed that after his body's mutation, he could unleash stronger magic at a smaller cost during spell usage. In other words, when fighting others in the future, his sustained combat ability would greatly increase. For a mage, having magic power last longer was undoubtedly a tremendous benefit.\n\nHowever, at this moment, Nian Bing couldn't spare a thought for the benefits of efficient magical energy. He was more concerned about Feng Nü's safety. Even if the Wind Soaring Technique wasn't as fast as a Blizzard, it was much faster than walking. Soon, he flew out of Dutian City from the air, heading quickly north. After flying ten li*, he indeed saw a dense cluster of trees by the main road. Nian Bing lowered his flight speed, rapidly traversing the forest above the treetops.\n\nDuring his flight, he was surprised to discover that his perception of the outside world was much stronger than before. Although he didn't have mental energy to activate, his sensory awareness was no worse than when he did use mental energy.\n\nJust as he was about to pass through the forest, Nian Bing abruptly increased his flight altitude. Observing from above was always easier. Perhaps there would even be a chance to ambush the enemy. He would do anything to save Feng Nü.\n\nJust then, a slow, drawling voice sounded in Nian Bing's ear. \"Kid, stop wasting effort flying. Come down quickly. Don't you want your wife's life anymore?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart tightened. The drawn-out voice sounded in his ear, but it was clear that this person was using a sound transmission technique. Feng Nü had used it before too, but never with such ease as the opponent. He hadn't even seen the person, yet the voice entered his ears so clearly.\n\nCollecting himself, Nian Bing sped up, finally passing through the forest. In the distance, he could already see a small hill. At the foot of the hill, Feng Nü's red figure was exceptionally clear. Seeing Feng Nü's figure, Nian Bing's heart immediately settled a great deal. Controlling his magical energy, he floated downwards.\n\nFeng Nü stood at the foot of the hill, her exquisite figure appearing somewhat delicate. The mountain breeze gently swayed her long red dress. She stood there motionless, her entire being seemingly dull and numb. She showed no reaction even when Nian Bing appeared, clearly having been restrained by a special method.\n\nNian Bing's gaze turned to Feng Nü's side. A Fatty was sitting on the ground. The Fatty's body was unusually tall; even sitting, he didn't seem much shorter than Nian Bing. A pair of large, flapping, fleshy hands were holding a roasted lamb leg, which he gnawed on continuously, seemingly relishing it. His hands were covered in grease, and a fire was burning in front of him, clearly used for roasting the lamb leg earlier.\n\nNian Bing had never seen this Fatty before. From his physique, it was difficult to estimate his weight; every part of his body was almost entirely covered in obese flesh, so his age was indiscernible. He was the one who had abducted Feng Nü.\n\nNian Bing walked step by step towards Feng Nü, saying coldly, \"What have you done to Feng Nü?\"\n\nThe Fatty continued to eat the roasted lamb leg in his hand, slowly rising from the ground. Nian Bing suddenly realized that he was two heads taller than himself, and with that massive body, he was practically a mountain of flesh. The Fatty waved the lamb leg, still with a small portion of meat on it, and chuckled. The fat on his face squeezed his eyes almost shut. \"That's right, it was me.\"\n\n\"Do we have a feud? I don't seem to know you,\" Nian Bing stopped, calmly observing the other.\n\nThe Fatty shook his head, biting off a piece of lamb and chewing it. \"No feud, no grievance.\"\n\n\"Then why did you abduct my wife and restrain her?\" Nian Bing stared at the Fatty. From his appearance, the Fatty had no presence whatsoever and exerted no pressure on him; his depth was completely indiscernible. But precisely because of this, Nian Bing felt even more worried. What was Feng Nü's strength? A Martial Saint! To be able to silently abduct Feng Nü here, this Fatty's strength was absolutely unfathomable.\n\nThe Fatty chuckled. \"Actually, I didn't have any other intentions in bringing your wife here. Don't worry, I won't harm her. Of course, that's only if you're willing to cooperate.\"\n\n\"Cooperate? How do we cooperate?\" Nian Bing looked at the Fatty, puzzled.\n\nThe Fatty gestured with the lamb leg in his hand. \"It's actually simple. There's only one way you can take your wife away: you have to defeat me. But, of course, there are conditions. I can give you time. Every ten days, you can challenge me once. As long as you win, you can naturally take her away. However, if you lose, then you'll have to wholeheartedly cook me a delicious meal. During this period, as long as you don't slack off, I guarantee your wife will be perfectly fine. Otherwise, well, it's hard to say.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at the Fatty with some surprise. \"How do you know I'm a chef?\" Since arriving in Dutian City, he had never displayed his culinary skills in front of others, and he had clearly never met this Fatty before.\n\nThe Fatty took another bite of lamb. When his large mouth opened, a large piece of meat went in. \"I came from the Ice Moon Empire. As you can see, I'm very fat. Fat people generally have two hobbies: eating and sleeping. I'm very fond of eating. After arriving in the Ice Moon Empire, I once ate at a place called Qingfeng Zhai. The food there was indeed very good. I heard people there say that someone had truly remarkable culinary skills, so I learned about your existence from various sources and came to find you. Kid, I hope your cooking doesn't disappoint me, otherwise, I'll cripple your wife before returning her to you. I heard you're quite arrogant, aren't you? The King of the Ice Moon Empire summoned you, and you didn't even go. So, I had no choice but to abduct your wife to see if you'd cook for me. How about it? If you're ready, we can start now.\"\n\nA cold glint flashed repeatedly in Nian Bing's eyes. From the Ice Moon Empire? Abducting Feng Nü just for food? After hearing the Fatty's words, he couldn't help but feel a little dumbfounded. Although the Fatty's smile was somewhat insidious, it was clear that he didn't genuinely intend to harm Nian Bing or Feng Nü. Nian Bing's tone became a bit more polite. \"Senior, if you wish to eat, it's very easy. How about this: you release Feng Nü first, and I will wholeheartedly prepare a delicious meal for you. What do you think?\"\n\nThe Fatty shook his large head repeatedly. \"No, no. I've been following you for several days; you're a very cunning kid. It's much safer with your wife here with me. Besides, I don't just want one meal; otherwise, I wouldn't have dragged my fat body all this way to find you. I watched your competition in that palace, whatever it was called. Although you're not very strong, you do have some unique qualities.\"\n\nNian Bing was startled. \"You've been in the palace? Are you Emperor Huatian's person?\"\n\nThe Fatty curled his lips. \"What's that Emperor worth? In my eyes, he's no different from a chicken leg. Don't try to trick me into talking; you definitely can't guess where I'm from. You don't need to worry about anything else; I've already stated my conditions. If you're willing to surrender now, then start cooking for me. I'm not greedy; I only eat once every ten days, and then I'll sleep. After you finish cooking for me today, I'll naturally contact you again in ten days.\"\n\nNian Bing's brows furrowed deeply. \"Are you threatening me?\"\n\nThe Fatty chuckled, the fat on his face trembling with his mirth. He said matter-of-factly, \"That's right, I am threatening you. So what? Who told you my fist is bigger than yours? If you've got the guts, hit me! If you can beat me, I'll return your wife, and you can punch me to vent your anger all you want. Unfortunately, I don't think you'll have much chance in this lifetime.\"\n\n\"Alright, if it's a fight, then it's a fight. Do you think I'm afraid of you? However, my wife might easily get caught in the crossfire here. How about you let me send her to a farther place, and then we fight?\" Nian Bing looked at the Fatty calmly.\n\nThe Fatty finished the last piece of meat on the lamb leg. \"Don't dream, kid. Don't I know what's on your mind? Don't even think about any tricks in front of me; it's useless. Keeping your wife safe? That's simple. I'll just put her away.\" As he spoke, to Nian Bing's astonished gaze, the Fatty waved his large hand, and a yellow light enveloped Feng Nü. In an instant, Feng Nü vanished from her spot.\n\n\"You, what did you do to Feng Nü?\" In his panic, Nian Bing couldn't help but take several steps forward consecutively.\n\nThe Fatty said leisurely, \"Nothing much, I put her in my spatial bag. Don't worry, this spatial bag can hold living creatures. Just a few days ago, I even put a few pigs in there. Otherwise, what if I get hungry?\"\n\nNian Bing was furious. He raised his hand and conjured a fireball. \"You dare to compare my Feng Nü to pigs, and even put her with pigs?\"\n\nThe Fatty seemed disinclined to provoke Nian Bing, repeatedly waving his hands. \"No, of course not. In my spatial bag, each item goes into its own dedicated space; they won't touch each other. I'm even afraid of their flavors mixing. Once we're done fighting, I'll release her and let you see that she's perfectly fine.\" The rapidly approaching fireball had just reached him when it was immediately blocked by a layer of yellow light and vanished.\n\nLooking at the Fatty, who was impervious to any persuasion**, Nian Bing suppressed his anger. From the fact that the Fatty had abducted Feng Nü, Nian Bing knew it would be difficult to contend with him. However, he had to at least try now, to see how big the gap between him and this Fatty truly was, before figuring out a way to save Feng Nü.\n\n\"Your Battle Qi is earth-attributed, but what does a warrior need a spatial bag for?\"\n\nThe Fatty said somewhat impatiently, \"Are you fighting or not? If you don't, I'll make a move on your wife. To be precise, I am a Magic Warrior. I also know a bit of earth-element magic. Plus, carrying a spatial bag is so convenient.\"\n\nA Magic Warrior? Nian Bing had never dealt with a Magic Warrior before. His vigilance increased by several points. With a faint smile, he said, \"Since you're pressing so hard, then I won't hold back.\" With a flash of silver light from his left hand, an extra piece of clothing suddenly appeared on his body.\n\nThe Fatty couldn't help but laugh when he saw Nian Bing's clothes. \"Kid, what are you wearing?! That's hilarious!\"\n\nNian Bing had an extra vest on him. The vest, worn over his cloth garment, looked a bit awkward. On this vest, there were hundreds of small fabric loops, and in each loop, a small scroll of some kind was inserted.\n\nNian Bing coldly looked at the Fatty, quickly sweeping his hands across the vest. Immediately, eight tiny scrolls appeared between the fingers of both his hands. This garment was specially made by a tailor he found. He hadn't been idle during these past days. Although he knew that excessive use of magic scrolls could affect magic cultivation, their decisive role meant he prepared them. Although this vest looked ordinary, the scrolls on it represented Nian Bing's entire fortune. He had spent almost all his money buying large quantities of top-grade blank scrolls. Fortunately, the success rate for making scrolls was relatively high, which allowed him to arm the entire vest. There were over a hundred scrolls in total, with the lowest being Fifth-tier. If sold, their value would definitely not be low.\n\nThe Fatty was first stunned for a moment, then asked, \"What are those things in your hand? Hidden weapons?\"\n\nNian Bing snorted disdainfully. \"And you call yourself a Magic Warrior? You don't even recognize scrolls.\" During the competition, he had told Bing Yun that if he met her outside, he would be confident in dealing with her even without the Eternal Sleep Magic Array, and he relied on this \"super vest\" to do so. Nian Bing had named this vest \"Hedgehog.\" Indeed, over a hundred offensive magic scrolls, if all unleashed their proper power, would be absolutely terrifying, well deserving of that name.\n\nThe Fatty chuckled. \"What's the use of that thing? Throw a few out and let me see.\"\n\nNian Bing did not grow angry due to the other party's contempt; instead, he became even more composed. A glint flashed in his eyes, and four scrolls flew out. Simultaneously, several wind blades struck forth, heading directly for the Fatty's massive head.\n\nThe Fatty didn't move, letting the wind blades strike him. The faint yellow light appeared around his body, and the wind blades vanished without even a sound. But by then, the four flying scrolls had already reached a zhang*** in front of the Fatty. With a thought from Nian Bing, the four scrolls simultaneously descended. At the same time, the other four scrolls in his hands also flew out. Facing such a powerful enemy, he held nothing back.\n\nRed light instantly erupted in front of the Fatty. Those were four Fifth-tier Fire Wall Spells, enhanced versions called Fire Barrier Spells. Compared to Fire Wall Spells, Fire Barrier Spells not only possessed more potent flame energy, but more importantly, they were mobile. The Fire Barrier Spells, like moving fortresses, rapidly pressed towards the Fatty.\n\n---\n*li (里): A traditional Chinese unit of distance, roughly 500 meters or half a kilometer.\n**impervious to any persuasion (油鹽不進): A Chinese idiom meaning someone is stubborn, unyielding, or unresponsive to reasoning or persuasion.

    "content": "Ethereal mists drifted like smoke, slowly carried by a gentle breeze, bringing a touch of dampness to the mountaintop.\n\nThe mists cleared and clouds drifted away, revealing the bare mountaintop. In the center of the mountaintop, a tall, burly fatty sat on the ground, chewing on something. \"Ugh, I've eaten my last drumstick. Why isn't that fellow here yet? He's deliberately keeping me in suspense. It's really not easy to get a grand meal out of him. Heavens! Why isn't he a woman? If he were, I'd marry her even if it cost me my life, just so she could comfort my stomach every day.\" As he spoke, the Fatty rubbed his belly with greasy hands, his face filled with lament. However, this lament on his large, fat face looked utterly comical.\n\n\"Fatty, you're daydreaming again. Do you think I still can't beat you this time? If I win, you must return my Phoenix Girl.\" A deep voice, as if from the Nine Netherworld, echoed.\n\nSeven points of brilliant light drifted down, landing simultaneously with a soft chime in front of the Fatty, arranged like the Big Dipper. They were seven blades, but only their hilts were visible. At the end of each hilt was an embedded, dazzling gemstone of a different shape and color. Blue, red, green, yellow, silver, white, and black—the seven colors interwove and shone brightly, instantly covering the mountaintop with a hazy, precious glow.\n\nThis was no ordinary precious glow, but a special barrier formed by the fusion of seven magical elements. Unless the caster willed it, or the seven colored gemstones powering the barrier were utterly destroyed, no one could touch these seven blades.\n\nThe Fatty clapped his hands and laughed, \"Good, good, the treasures have arrived. And you, boy, who uses these treasures, come out too. Quickly, let me see what new tricks you've got. If you can beat me, I'll return your Phoenix Girl. Otherwise, old rules, you owe me a full Seven-Element grand meal.\"\n\n\"Hmph, Fatty, be careful. This time, I'm afraid you won't just miss out on a Seven-Element grand meal; you'll lose your life here.\" From the mist, a figure clad in gray cloth robes slowly emerged. It was a young man, appearing to be in his twenties, with long golden hair flowing down his back. His face, handsome enough to make women jealous, was covered by a faint chill. His blue eyes, as clear as lake water, gazed calmly ahead. He didn't look at the Fatty; his gaze was fixed on the seven dazzling gemstones, as if they were his entire life.\n\nThe Fatty chuckled, saying, \"That depends on your skill. You should know, Fatty will fight for his food. As the saying goes: 'Shredded meat is precious, sliced meat costs more, but if there's a big chunk of meat, both can be tossed aside.'* Come on, come on, I've still got enough energy in my belly to play a round with you.\"\n\nThe golden-haired young man sighed, \"Fatty, why must you make things so difficult for me? Return my Phoenix Girl, and at worst, I'll make you a Seven-Element grand meal for a whole month straight. If you don't let me see Phoenix Girl, then today, even if I have to use life magic at the cost of my own life, I'll make sure you stay here.\"\n\nThe Fatty pinched his fat-filled chin and said, \"Oh, that won't do. If you don't have something to long for in your heart, the food you make will taste inferior. How can you expect me to eat something secondary after I've tasted the best? To be honest, your talent, young man, is the best I've ever seen. For magic to be practiced to your level, it truly makes Fatty here admire you greatly!\"\n\nThe young man gave a wry smile, \"You know perfectly well that I don't practice magic to be a magician, but to create more delicious dishes. Besides, I can only use up to level eight magic.\"\n\nThe Fatty shook his head and said, \"It's different. Although you can only use level eight magic, your control and understanding of magic are unmatched by those so-called Archmages. I ask you, who among them can achieve Ice and Fire of the Same Origin, and use its power to draw upon the essence of other magical elements to drive wind, earth, space, light, and darkness—the other five magical elements? Although it's only auxiliary, you are the first All-Element Magician on the entire continent. I remember them calling you, indeed, your power fundamentally lies in ice and fire, so this title suits you best. Haha, today I get to eat well again!\"\n\nThe golden-haired young man's eyes blazed with cold light. He frowned and said, \"So, that means we still have to fight.\"\n\nThe Fatty laughed, \"Of course, of course, I'm still waiting to eat your Seven-Element grand meal. Just like before, I'll give you time to chant your spells. Start speaking. Getting a little exercise before a meal is certainly nice. I seem to have gained quite a bit of weight recently.\"\n\nThe golden-haired young man's gaze changed, becoming unusually focused. From beginning to end, his eyes remained fixed on the seven exposed gemstones. \"We've known each other for quite a while now, and I've never introduced you to my eating tools. They are my closest friends.\"\n\nThe Fatty said, a little curious, \"Oh? I've never heard you mention them. These seven blades are stranger than the last. Do tell me about them.\"\n\nA look of infatuation appeared in the golden-haired young man's eyes. \"Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess—Morning Dew.\" With a soft hum, a blue light suddenly flared, and the water elements on the mountaintop visibly intensified.\n\n\"Roar of the Fire God—Righteous Sun Blade.\" Red light flared.\n\n\"Whisper of the Free Wind—Proud Sky Blade.\" Green light flared.\n\n\"Melody of Earth's Awakening—Longevity Blade.\" Yellow light flared.\n\n\"Ever-Shifting Six-Pointed Star—Xuanji Blade.\" Silver light flared.\n\n\"Dawn that Pierces Heaven and Earth—Holy Radiance Blade.\" White light flared.\n\n\"Curse of Eternal Hell—Demon Devouring Blade.\" Black light flared.\n\nThe seven-colored lights suddenly burst forth, interweaving into brilliant hues like a rainbow. The golden-haired young man smiled, gazing at the seven-colored lights, and said, \"They are the Seven Divine Blades, also staves that condense the seven elements of ice, fire, wind, earth, space, light, and darkness. Most importantly, they are all my kitchen knives.\"\n\nThe smile on the Fatty's face suddenly vanished, replaced by a grave expression. He clearly felt that this time, the young man's aura was significantly different from before. A faint golden light appeared on him, which was precisely the pinnacle of battle qi—Divine Battle Qi. His upper body tilted slightly forward. His large, fat body, enveloped in golden light, now resembled a solid greatsword. Yes, he was indeed a Sword Saint, possessing the highest title among warriors.\n\nThe golden-haired young man's eyes blazed brightly. He raised both hands. His slender, nimble fingers, guided by his forearms, swiftly drew two six-pointed stars in front of him, one red and one blue, appearing exceptionally distinct. \"Oh, Ice and Snow Goddess, please grant me eternal ice! Oh, Fire God! Please grant me the flame of the Phoenix Nirvana! In my name, the limits of ice and fire, merge!\" The seven gemstones on the seven blades simultaneously lit up. Red and blue lights intertwined, pulling the other five colored lights to rush towards the golden-haired young man.\n\nThe seven-colored lights enveloped the young man's body, using the previous red and blue six-pointed stars as a guide, forming a strange All-Element barrier. A strange smile appeared in the young man's eyes. He said to the Fatty, \"Let me show you the special skill magic I've newly researched: All-Element • Shadow Puppet.\"\n\n...\n___\n* \"Shredded meat is precious, sliced meat costs more, but if there's a big chunk of meat, both can be tossed aside.\" This is a humorous parody of a well-known Chinese poem from the Qing Dynasty, \"Life and Love,\" by Petőfi Sándor, which begins: \"Life is precious, love is more valuable; for freedom, both can be thrown away.\" Here, \"life\" and \"love\" are replaced with different forms of meat.",

    "content": "隨著神志的漸漸復甦，Nianbing漸漸想起了先前發生的一切。他猛地睜開眼睛，發現自己在一處荒野之中。陽光照在身上帶來陣陣溫熱，清新的空氣使他感覺好了不少。\n\n低頭向自己身上看去，Nianbing不禁慘呼一聲。他的「刺蝟背心」還在，但是，上面那些捲軸卻連一個都沒有剩下。那可是錢啊！而且是精力！製作這些捲軸，Nianbing足足用了一個月的時間。單是各種捲軸作用的研究分析，以及搭配，就耗費了他不少心力。但是，現在卻全都用掉了。\n\nFatty，Fatty呢？Nianbing清醒過來第一個想到的人就是Fatty。他當然不是擔心Fatty的安危，他是擔心Fatty收入空間袋中的Feng Nü。如果Fatty被自己炸死了，那Feng Nü豈不是……\n\n就在Nianbing悔恨交加之時，慢吞吞的聲音從背後響起：「怎麼，醒了嗎？好啊好啊！看來我要有好吃的了。嘿嘿。」\n\nNianbing回身看去，只見Fatty正靠在一顆大樹旁，笑吟吟地看著自己。看到Fatty沒事，Nianbing反而鬆了口氣。至少，這可以證明自己的Feng Nü還活著，這就足夠了。\n\n「媽的，你這死胖子是什麼東西做的？我那麼多魔法捲軸都沒炸死你。」\n\nFatty看著一臉不甘的Nianbing，微微一笑，道：「你那些魔法捲軸多是多了，而且大都可以產生連鎖反應。可惜的是，單一的強度還不夠，就算當時我不跑，也無法給我帶來什麼傷害。可惜啊可惜，那些捲軸還是很不錯的。如果在你的精神力控制下，所能達到的威力應該更大吧。但是，現在只是炸平了一座小山和一片森林而已。那些東西製作是不是很容易？看你用起來一點也不心疼似的。」\n\n「放屁！你才不心疼！那可都是我的寶貝啊！」看著Fatty的樣子，Nianbing不禁有些欲哭無淚了。對方的實力比自己想像中還要強悍得多。難道他是一個武聖級別的魔武士？不，不會是這麼簡單，他的實力也太強橫了，一個武聖也不可能那麼輕易地就化解了自己兩個九階魔法啊！這個Fatty，實在可怕得無法想像。\n\nFatty看著Nianbing氣急敗壞的樣子，站起身走了過來。「小子，別多想了。這第一次的比試，是不是算你輸了？當時，你可沒有再戰的能力了。」\n\nNianbing哼了一聲，道：「你實力比我強那麼多，我有可能贏麼？你的戰鬥氣究竟到達了什麼境界，竟然連我那麼多魔法都拿你沒辦法。」\n\nFatty微笑道：「我很懶惰，不過，並不代表我笨。你那些魔法捲軸如果威力能加在一起，別說是我了，就算是那些自稱為神的傢伙也不可能對抗。可惜，魔法的威力是很難疊加的，就算你能疊加一個兩個，卻也無法讓它們全部疊加。你最後的那些魔法捲軸一個也沒對我構成威脅，我直接帶著你就跑了。難道當時你就沒想過自己麼？那麼多魔法捲軸爆炸的威力，恐怕你小子身體受不了吧。」\n\nNianbing沉默了，是啊！如果當時自己還在原地，恐怕；恐怕……他抬頭看向Fatty：「這麼說，是你救了我？」\n\nFatty嘿嘿一笑，道：「當然了，你不用感激我，只要做飯的時候拿出真本事就行了。」\n\nNianbing哼了一聲，道：「鬼才會感激你！好，這第一次算我認輸就是了。」\n\nFatty眼中流露出一絲喜色：「好，那你現在就開始給我做飯吧。」\n\nNianbing道：「Fatty，我跟你商量件事情如何？」既然不能力敵就只有智取了。雖然他對自己很有信心，尤其是對未來的發展，但是，他也知道，自己想戰勝眼前這個Fatty，恐怕不是幾年內能夠做到的。\n\n「哦？你想和我商量什麼？最好是與吃有關，我最喜歡聊吃的了，那會增進我的食慾。」\n\nNianbing勉強擠出一絲微笑，道：「你看，你實力這麼強，怎麼是我能夠相比的？別說打上一次，魔法師打上十次、百次我也不可能贏得了你。這樣吧，你指定一個數字，讓我給你做多少道菜，完成這個數字，你就還我Feng Nü，行不行？這對你來說並沒有什麼損失啊！而且，我的廚藝雖然出色，但你總有吃膩的時候。等完成了你說的數字之後，我再介紹一位好的廚師給你就是了。」\n\nFatty眼中流露出一絲思索的光芒：「你說的似乎有點道理。不過呢，我比較喜歡睡覺，一般大吃一頓後要大睡上一場。不好，我不能答應你，我要是說個天文數字你也不會幹啊！小子，你怎麼對你這麼沒信心？在普通人中，像你這個年紀居然連『天眼』才能開啟的可沒有幾個。要知道，天眼這東西可是那些自稱為神的傢伙所特有的。有了這東西，作為一名魔法師，你今後提升的速度是很快的，總有一天，你會達到與我抗衡的實力。」\n\n「天眼？那是什麼東西？」Nianbing心跳一動，下意識地想起了自己眉心處的那個透明球。\n\nFatty道：「你不知道也很正常，普通人少有能知道天眼存在的。天眼，也可以說是人的第三隻眼睛。每個人都有，這也是人類所特有的。天眼能夠看到本身雙眼找不到的東西，只不過，一般人的天眼在出生後就自動封閉了。雖然我不知道你是怎麼開啟天眼的，但是，能夠把天眼打開，對你未來的發展有無盡的好處。」\n\nNianbing愣了一下，道：「有這麼好？我怎麼沒覺得。只是用它看東西似乎更清晰一點似的。」\n\nFatty不屑地哼了一聲，道：「你懂個屁。人的眉心是『竅穴』所在，你開啟的不光是天眼，同時也是你的『靈竅』。就算是一個傻子，只要他的天眼開了，靈竅也會開啟，在短時間內就能變成一個聰明人。竅穴這東西神妙得很，據說，人的身體裡有七個竅穴。如果能夠全部打開，就能成為真正的神。而這天眼，正是七個竅穴中極為重要的一個。」\n\nNianbing想了想，道：「你說了這麼多，我也沒有看出這天眼真正的用途有多大。我本來就不是傻人，就算再變得聰明一點也沒什麼。難道，這天眼比起『先天領域』還要好麼？」\n\nFatty沒好氣地道：「你這小子真是什麼都不懂。先天領域算什麼東西？如果那破玩意兒能和竅穴相比，那現在也沒什麼『神之大陸』了。天眼的真正妙用如何，我也不太清楚。反正，我能告訴你的是，有了這東西，不出十年，你至少就能夠成為一名魔法師。」\n\n「你說什麼？」Nianbing吃驚地站了起來，大腦中眩暈感也無法彌補此時他心中的驚訝。十年就能成為『神降師』？這真的有可能麼？\n\nFatty嘿嘿一笑，道：「很驚訝吧？現在你知道天眼能帶來的好處了。天眼還有一個稱號，叫『審判之眼』，也叫『辨別之眼』。有了它，你就能夠看到許多平時無法看到的東西，理解許多根本無法理解的東西，任何知識在你面前都將變得容易起來。有了天眼，對於開啟其他六個竅穴也是大有好處的。別說是你了，就算是神之大陸上，也沒有幾個人能先開啟『天眼穴』的。要知道，竅穴每開啟一個，再想開啟下一個，難度就要加倍。而天眼穴如果不是第一個開啟，那必然就要到最後一個開啟。據我所知，神之大陸上號稱最強的神，也不過只開啟了六個竅穴，努力了數千年，最後也沒能開啟成功天眼穴。但是，如能第一個開啟天眼，那麼，今後再開啟其他六個竅穴就會容易許多，雖然難度也會逐一增加，但增加的程度卻會少一倍。如果按時間來計算，至少能節省三分之二吧。」\n\nNianbing心頭一震，他突然想到了一種可能：「Fatty，難道你是來自神之大陸的神？」\n\nFatty愣了一下，這才意識到自己的話有些多了：「隨便你怎麼想，你要願意那麼認為也無所謂。不過，我臉皮可沒厚，從不會自己說自己是什麼神啊神的。神有什麼高貴的？所謂的神，其實都他媽是人，無非就是往自己臉上貼金罷了，有什麼意思？」\n\nNianbing心中產生了強烈的震撼，苦笑道：「Fatty，怎麼說你至少也算是個半神的傢伙吧，又何必與我一個普通人類為難呢？難道你就那麼愛吃？神也要吃東西的麼？」\n\nFatty哼了一聲，道：「我都說了，世間根本就沒有什麼神，那些都是人自己自稱的。既然本身是人，當然要吃東西，只不過實力強大的，可以長時間不吃，依靠體內的能量維持生命而已。吃可是一門藝術，也是人從生到老死始終都能享受到的東西。在我心中，沒有什麼事能夠與吃相比的，所以嘛，這吃的愛好，我一生都不會改了。」\n\nNianbing深吸口氣，Fatty似乎並不那麼可怕。但是，他為什麼要告訴自己這麼多呢？是了，他一定是認為自己無論如何也無法逃脫他的掌握吧。天哪，居然是一個半神抓了Feng Nü。看來，自己想救出心愛的女人還要經歷一個無比漫長的過程。\n\n「小子，你想什麼呢？你放心，我雖然愛吃，不過還是很通情達理的。你要做什麼事都無所謂，我不會限制你的自由。不過，我一直都會在你附近跟著你。你要想跑嘛，也行，只要你不想要自己老婆的命，就隨便你跑好了。對了，有件事我可以告訴你，雖然你老婆被我關在空間袋中，但外面發生的一切她都能夠看到。你努力吧，說不定，等你把她救出來的時候，她會非常感動哦。你也不用怕我找不到你，你的精神力已經被我鎖定了，除非你離開大陸，否則，不論你在什麼地方我都能找到你。」\n\nNianbing深吸口氣，道：「看你的意思，似乎是吃定我了？」\n\nFatty笑道：「你認為呢？」\n\n「好，吃定就吃定吧。不過，Fatty我有個問題，你能不能回答我？」\n\nFatty點了點頭，道：「當然可以，今後還不知道要吃你多長時間，回答你幾個問題算什麼？你問吧。」\n\nNianbing點了點頭，道：「你把那什麼叫『竅』的東西說得那麼神乎其神的，那麼，你開啟了幾個竅穴呢？」\n\nFatty臉色一僵，但很快又恢復了正常，道：「我的修煉方法和你們普通人不一樣，所以，我的實力提升是與竅穴無關的，這個問題我沒法回答你。不過，要是按照除天眼之外的其他竅穴實力來看，我現在的能力應該相當於開啟了兩個半竅穴左右吧。」\n\n「天眼穴和其他竅穴區別很大麼？難道其他竅穴直接和實力有關？」Nianbing立刻問出了自己心中的疑惑。既然無法打過對方，那麼，不斷提升自己的實力自然是最好的辦法。而想提升自己的實力，身邊這個Fatty就是追逐的對象。他所帶給自己的東西，有很多是自己根本不是用想像所能達到的。所以，只有多問，這個看上去倒是很好說話。如果能從他身上得知一些修煉的知識，對自己來說得益無疑是巨大的，畢竟，這個傢伙是個半神啊！\n\nFatty點了點頭，道：「區別當然很大。天眼穴也可以說是七竅穴中的『靈穴』，它並不是提升實力的，而是提升學習的能力和適應能力。以後你就會慢慢明白了，天眼穴開啟，你的身體將逐漸發生變化。當然，想要獲得更強大的實力你也要多加修煉，只有那樣，才能充分發揮出天眼穴的作用。」",

    "content": "「As for the other acupoints, each one can make your strength undergo a qualitative leap. Naturally, these qualitative leaps are different, because the abilities each acupoint enhances are not the same. How they materialize, I'm not very clear myself; you'll have to explore it slowly on your own. Your Heaven's Eye is already open, and you'll gradually sense it. I was wondering why your strength seemed very ordinary in that competition, and how in just one day you suddenly became much more formidable. It's because your Heaven's Eye Acupoint opened. You've only just opened it, so slowly hone yourself.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes gleamed with a cold light, \"Fatty, I'm grateful you told me this. If you can let Feng Nü go, I'm willing to follow you and cook for you until my strength surpasses yours, how about that? Feng Nü must be so lonely always being cooped up in your spatial pouch! Don't you know how unbearable loneliness feels?\"\n\nThe Fatty said indifferently, \"Loneliness is unbearable, but it's also the greatest test for a person. Don't worry, didn't I tell you she can perceive everything outside? I won't let her go crazy. Moreover, it's quieter inside my spatial pouch, and it doesn't affect her cultivation. For her, there are only benefits, no downsides. I will absolutely not let her out, hehe. Kid, I just love seeing you anxious. This Fatty is also quite knowledgeable about food. A chef, when in different moods, will make completely different dishes even with the same ingredients. I imagine, for your wife's safety, the dishes you make will taste quite good.\"\n\nNian Bing was speechless. He realized this Fatty was much craftier than he had imagined. When he tried to get information out of him, the Fatty seemed very honest, hiding nothing at all. But once he tried to find a way to make him release Feng Nü, he became craftier than anyone. Coercion wouldn't work, but enticement was equally difficult.\n\n\"Alright, I've wasted enough breath on you. This Fatty's stomach is rumbling. Quick. Hurry up and cook for me. I want to start with the dishes you're good at. I've heard you can make something called 'Ice-Fire Nine Dragons Reaching Heaven Cuisine.' I want to eat that. Don't worry, even though this Fatty has a big stomach, I don't eat much. Just make about twenty simple dishes for me, and that'll be enough. After all, good cuisine is about quality, not quantity.\"\n\n\"Damn, twenty dishes and that's 'not much'? But looking at your stomach, it seems you really could fit it all. But, Fatty, there's something you don't seem to realize. Making top-tier dishes requires a lot of ingredients. Only good ingredients can make good food. I imagine you haven't prepared that many ingredients, have you?\"\n\nThe Fatty's face stiffened, \"Ingredients? Uh? I do have some here, but only two pigs, three sheep, and two cows. Can these be used for your 'Ice-Fire Nine Heavens' whatever it is?\"\n\nNian Bing snorted, \"Do you think I only know how to barbecue? We're in the middle of nowhere here. Do you want a wild vegetable feast?\"\n\nThe Fatty scratched his big head, which had sparse hair. \"I was so focused on having you cook for me that I forgot ingredients are the most important thing. Then let's find a place. Going back to Dutian City from here doesn't seem too far. By then, there'll be food.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head, \"No, I can't go back to Dutian City. If word gets out that I won the Rising Star Mage Competition there, Emperor Huatian probably won't let me leave easily. Since I'm already out of the city, I can't go back. If you want to eat, let's find another city. Just a heads-up, I'm completely penniless. You'll have to pay for the ingredients. My poor magic scrolls! Those were all my worldly possessions, originally kept to exchange for money at any time, but now they're all gone.\"\n\nThe smile on the Fatty's face also turned bitter, \"Uh, well, money is indeed a problem. I don't seem to have much either.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Aren't you quite capable? Well then! You could easily perform for money. With your skills, earning enough for food shouldn't be a big problem, right?\"\n\n\"Nonsense! For me, a dignified... how could I perform for money? Kid, just stick with me, I'll figure it out. Let me think, there should be a city a bit farther from here. Flying there shouldn't take too long.\"\n\nNian Bing sat down on the spot, \"Fly? I can't fly now. How do you expect me to fly without magic power?\"\n\nThe Fatty was stunned for a moment, then said, \"Alright, I'll take you flying. You can recover some magic power while we're at it, then cook for me later. Kid, I'm warning you, don't try any tricks. If you fall from the sky, hehe, you know the outcome.\" Nian Bing felt a blur before his eyes. The next moment, his body had left the ground. The Fatty had simply tucked him under his arm and soared into the sky. In a blink, everything on the ground became barely discernible.\n\nSo fast! How did he fly? Even if Nian Bing used his Blizzard flight speed, it definitely wouldn't be half as fast as the Fatty. His heart was filled with doubt. Was this magic? No, there were no magic fluctuations! Was it battle qi? Can battle qi fly too?\n\nAs if sensing Nian Bing's doubts, the Fatty, while flying rapidly, said, \"Why can't battle qi fly? It's the same energy. What magic can do, battle qi can naturally do, it's just the method of achieving it that's different. How about it, my flying speed isn't slow, is it? Hahahaha.\"\n\nNian Bing's face showed a helpless, bitter smile. Faced with such a powerful Fatty, he truly had no choice. For now, he could only take things one step at a time. Fortunately, this Fatty genuinely seemed to only care about food and had no real intention of harming him. Otherwise, he probably wouldn't even know how he died. Thinking this, he temporarily resigned himself to fate, closed his eyes, and carefully sensed the mysteries brought by the Heaven's Eye Acupoint that the Fatty had mentioned. To defeat this demigod-like Fatty, he could only continuously strive.\n\n...\n\n\"What? Nian Bing disappeared?\" Emperor Huatian's brows furrowed slightly.\n\nPrince Rong said somewhat helplessly, \"I don't know what that kid is thinking. He didn't come to the banquet tonight, and when I sent people to look for him, the place was already empty. Your Majesty, should I send people to capture him and bring him back?\"\n\nHuatian shook his head and said, \"Forget it, old Rong. What's our relationship, as brothers? I trust you. He's a member of your Rong family anyway; eventually, all fallen leaves return to their roots. He'll come back someday. Oh, right, those two youngsters from the Langmu Empire seem a bit restless. It's not advisable for us to escalate conflict with them too much right now, so please send people to escort them out of the country.\"\n\nA cold gleam flashed in Prince Rong's eyes. He said calmly, \"I've already noticed their actions. They think they're being secretive, but they've forgotten that this is our territory. Is there anything we don't know? Your Majesty, our military is strong and robust now. I believe, in a few more days, it will be time for action.\"\n\nHuatian sighed softly, \"Old Rong! Perhaps I truly am old. The youthful drive I once had has long since worn away. I'm not very interested in war, and furthermore, I don't want the empire we worked so hard to establish to be destroyed by a momentary error in judgment. Do you understand what I mean?\"\n\nPrince Rong looked at his brother, Huatian, and smiled slightly. He said, \"I naturally understand what you mean. I also considered it for a long time before deciding to propose an attack to you. Our secret units have been established for a long time. If we don't let them get some activity, how can they be better honed? From a formal analysis, at least on the surface, the Qilu Empire is allied with us, and this time both of their mages died. I have already sent envoys with gifts to apologize. As for the Aolan Empire, after the last war, it was severely weakened. For their nation to recover will certainly not be a matter of a day or two. If we have military action, they will avoid it like the plague, and naturally won't come forward to their deaths. Just for the Silverwing Knights to recover to their original state will take a very long time. Therefore, now is our best opportunity to strike. I want to personally lead a force to tour the Langmu Empire. The goal isn't to destroy them; merely plundering them like we did the Aolan Empire will suffice. Fighting to sustain the fight is the only way to keep our army's strength consistently at its peak. Once the time is ripe, what's wrong with challenging the entire continent? Don't you hope to see the Huatian-Rong Empire unify the continent in your lifetime?\"\n\nEmperor Huatian's eyes lit up, \"Old Rong, you seem very confident!\"\n\nPrince Rong smiled slightly, \"Ah, you! It's not that your youthful drive has worn away; you're clearly testing my confidence. Given our nation's current situation, we no longer need to share a piece of the pie with the Qilu Empire. As long as we leave two hundred thousand troops to guard the Eastern Border, I don't believe they'll dare to act rashly. Although the Langmu Empire is a tough nut to crack, it'll be easy for me to leave a few tooth marks on it.\"\n\nHuatian laughed, \"You are indeed right; for an army to maintain strong combat power, war is the best baptism. However, you must remember our old policy: to avoid creating strong ethnic hatred, you can burn, you can loot, but absolutely no killing of civilians. It's time for our secret units to strike as well. How do you plan to fight?\"\n\nPrince Rong took a few steps forward, walked to Huatian's side, and whispered, \"This war must be sudden. I have two objectives. First, the Langmu Plains of the Langmu Empire are flat, fertile, and extremely rich in various resources. Therefore, our mission this time is to plunder. I plan to lead an army of three hundred thousand, with one hundred thousand combat troops and the remaining two hundred thousand as transport and supply units. We'll seize as much as we can. As for the second objective, it's even simpler: I want to lure the Langmu Empire's elite cavalry regiment over, then destroy them in one fell swoop with lightning speed. You know very well how many resources it takes to train a powerful cavalry regiment. As long as we achieve this second point, even if the Langmu Empire wants revenge, they probably wouldn't dare to act rashly.\"\n\nHuatian said, somewhat surprised, \"One hundred thousand combat troops? Isn't that a bit few?\"\n\nA divine light filled with confidence shone in Prince Rong's eyes. \"Not few at all, absolutely not. Although these troops aren't enough to occupy cities or destroy the Langmu Empire, they are more than enough to annihilate their elite forces. Don't you know how formidable our secret units are?\"\n\nLight burst forth in Huatian's eyes, \"Good, it shall be as you say. Prince Rong, heed my command.\"\n\nPrince Rong bowed and said, \"Your subject is present.\"\n\nHuatian said solemnly, \"I command you to lead the grand army to attack the Langmu Empire. All military actions will be under your full responsibility. Among the participating officers and soldiers, including members of the imperial family, if anyone disobeys orders, execute them first and report later.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\" Prince Rong straightened his back, his gaze fixed on the north. He thought to himself, *Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, just you wait. Weakening Langmu is merely every step of my plan. As long as I live, one day, my iron cavalry will tread upon the lands of the Ice Moon Empire. Nian Bing, you brat, you must live up to my expectations. Grandfather will try his best to create all sorts of situations within ten years. I hope that when I unify the continent, it will also be the day you destroy the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess.*\n\nHuatian continued, \"Also, since we are going to wage war on Langmu, there's no need to escort the people they sent this time. Apart from those two competitors, all other spies who dared to invade our country will be eliminated. I wonder if the destruction of over a thousand elite warriors and dozens of high-level mages will make that old geezer of the Langmu Empire feel the pinch? Hehe.\"\n\nPrince Rong pondered for a moment, then said, \"Your Majesty, that imperial prince can be released, but should we also keep that girl with the Innate Domain? Someone with such a powerful Innate Domain poses a great threat to our future.\"\n\nHuatian shook his head, \"No, they came to participate in the competition after all. We cannot give others any leverage. Let them go. Are we, a great nation, afraid of a single mage? Qianhuan Bingyun must also be released. Old Rong, you understand what I mean, right?\"\n\nPrince Rong laughed, \"I understand, of course I understand. Your strategic vision is always much stronger than mine. That's why I said back then, among us three brothers, only you were most suitable to be this emperor. Oh, by the way, old Su has been very quiet lately! I'm about to embark on a campaign; should we go have a drink with him?\"\n\nHuatian chuckled, \"You, you! You must be thinking about Old Su's century-old plum wine again, aren't you? Fine, I've wanted to drink it for a while too. This time, we'll use the excuse of a farewell drink for you. I'm sure he won't be reluctant.\"\n\nFor more chapters, welcome to Qidian<sup>1</sup> to support the author.\n\nThe two old men, with their impure motives, exchanged a smile, as if they had returned to their youth.\n\n...\n\n\"What? Nian Bing is gone?\" Mu Jing's brows furrowed deeply as she looked at her brother.\n\nMu Rong nodded and said, \"I've already dispatched more people to search. The competition only ended half a day ago, so I hope he hasn't left the city yet. Did he sense something? How could he act so quickly?\"\n\nMu Jing's brows furrowed slightly, \"Impossible. Our actions were secretive enough; how could he have discovered anything? Brother, dispatch more people. You must find his whereabouts. This person is very important. I truly didn't expect him to have such deep mastery in magic arrays. Although he used some tricks, he still defeated Bingyun. From this point alone, he's worth us expending more effort to win over. If we can get the champion of the Five Nations Rising Star Mage Competition to publicly announce joining our Langmu Empire, it would greatly benefit our nation's reputation.\"\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> Qidian: A major Chinese online literature platform.",

    "content": "Mù Róng said, \"Don't worry, I know my limits. I've already sent all my subordinates out. I believe news will come soon. After all, Niànbīng is just a mage; he shouldn't be able to run fast.\"\n\n\"Run? Why would I run?\" A cold voice came from outside the door. Mù Róng's siblings were startled simultaneously. Although they hadn't ordered their subordinates to stand guard to avoid the Huá Róng Empire discovering that they had brought a large number of masters into Dōutiān City, they hadn't detected someone sneaking to their door with their spiritual power.\n\nThe door opened, and two people walked in from outside. The one leading them was Róng Bīng, the Róng family's foremost figure of the third generation. Róng Jí followed behind him, his face calm, holding a slender magic staff.\n\nAs soon as Mù Jīng saw them, a hint of a smile immediately appeared on her face. She quickly went to greet them and said, \"Didn't the banquet just end? Why have you two come here again? Do you still want to spar with us siblings in magic?\"\n\nRóng Bīng said coldly, \"If you wish to spar, I will certainly fulfill your desire. However, I am not here for that. The competition is over, and I believe you no longer have a reason to stay in Dōutiān City. Please leave immediately.\"\n\nMù Róng said, slightly angered, \"Is this how your Huá Róng Empire treats guests?\"\n\nRóng Bīng said indifferently, \"Treating guests depends on what kind of guests they are. Guests like you are not welcome in our Huá Róng Empire. Seeing as you were participants in this competition, we won't keep you. Otherwise, leaving wouldn't be so easy.\"\n\nMù Róng still wanted to say something, but Mù Jīng stopped him. \"Alright, let's go.\" With that, she pulled her brother and walked towards the door.\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Róng Bīng spoke again. \"I forgot to tell you something. Dōutiān City hasn't been very peaceful lately. A band of bandits, totaling nine hundred and sixty-seven people, infiltrated the city. They have all been killed now. You should be careful on your way; try not to encounter any more bandits.\"\n\nUpon hearing the number nine hundred and sixty-seven, Mù Róng's siblings both trembled all over, and a sudden look appeared in their eyes. This number was too familiar to them; it was precisely the number of masters they had brought to the Huá Róng Empire! Mù Róng's expression seemed a little flustered. Mù Jīng, however, was calmer. She turned to Róng Bīng and asked, \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\nRóng Bīng said coldly, \"It means nothing. You two have a good journey. I won't see you out.\"\n\nMù Jīng took a deep breath, glared fiercely at Róng Bīng, and then forcibly pulled Mù Róng out of the room.\n\n***\n\nLate at night, Mù Róng's siblings finally left Dōutiān City. Walking on the road, Mù Róng finally couldn't help but ask the doubt in his heart, \"Sister. Is what that Róng Bīng said true? Could our people...\"\n\nMù Jīng nodded, saying sadly, \"It seems we still underestimated the Róng family's strength. To silently eliminate so many of our masters is truly terrifying. Their ruthlessness clearly shows they intend to act against our Lǎng Mù Empire. We must return quickly and prepare. Now, our greatest fortune is just hoping that Róng Bīng wasn't lying and won't pursue us further. Let's go.\"\n\n***\n\nWiping the sweat from his forehead, Niànbīng sat on the ground, not wanting to move an inch, while the Fatty beside him appeared extremely excited, continuously stuffing all sorts of delicacies into his mouth.\n\nAlthough Fatty flew very fast, they only arrived at the small city named Sī nóng when dusk fell. This city was not even a tenth the size of Dōutiān City. Fortunately, the Huá Róng Empire was extremely prosperous, so even in such a small city, Niànbīng could still find all the materials he needed.\n\nHe hadn't cooked for a while, and making twenty high-quality dishes from the \"Ice and Fire Nine Heavens\" cuisine all at once exhausted Niànbīng immensely. It was especially strenuous because he was using magic to prepare the dishes while his magical power was already greatly depleted.\n\nFatty had an easy time solving money problems. In Niànbīng's words, he was a bandit. In the time it took for a single meal, he somehow produced a large bag of purple gold coins. Fatty seemed very indifferent to money and gave it all to Niànbīng. After purchasing enough materials, the two rented the kitchen at this small restaurant, and Niànbīng worked until midnight to complete these dishes.\n\n\"Delicious, mm, truly worthy of a high-level chef. There are so many variations in each dish. So magic can change the taste of food so much, excellent, excellent, not a wasted effort. Niànbīng kid, aren't you eating?\"\n\nNiànbīng glared irritably as Fatty continuously swept the last plate of dishes into his cavernous mouth. \"Eat what? Do you want me to lick the plates? All twenty dishes are done. Even if you won't release Fèng Nǚ, can't you let her out to breathe a bit, and let me see her? This request isn't too much, is it? I've worked hard for you for half the day.\"\n\nFatty shook his large head repeatedly, saying, \"Dream on! Although the dishes you made today tasted very good, they were all prepared using only ice and fire magic as a basis. You can clearly use seven types of magic, yet you only used two to make the dishes. You're clearly just going through the motions with me. How about this: once you make a full-element feast, I'll reconsider letting you two meet.\"\n\nNiànbīng angrily stood up. \"Bullshit! What 'going through the motions'? What do you take me for? Even the highest-level chefs need time to research new dishes. Getting these seven knives complete only happened in the last two days, and lately, I've been busy cultivating magic. Where would I find time to research culinary arts?\"\n\nFatty chuckled, saying, \"That's your business, what does it have to do with me? Anyway, I only care about the dishes. Alright, I've eaten and drunk my fill, I'm going to find a place to sleep. You do whatever you want. I'll come find you in ten days, and by then, I hope you'll have made some progress. The money I gave you is not for buying magic scrolls; it's for buying materials. Next time I see you using magic scrolls, my response won't be as simple as just defending myself, kid. You'd better pray for yourself.\"\n\nNiànbīng looked at the table full of messy plates and said, \"Then I'll go find a place to rest.\" With that, he turned and walked out. He knew Fatty wouldn't release Fèng Nǚ so easily, but as long as he could satisfy Fatty's demands for food, Fèng Nǚ would be temporarily safe, only having lost her freedom. To rescue Fèng Nǚ sooner, he had to quickly increase his strength.\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Fatty patted his unusually plump belly with satisfaction and came to Niànbīng's side. \"Kid, to make your memory more profound, come with me first.\" Saying that, he grabbed Niànbīng and twice soared into the air. Niànbīng didn't resist because he knew resisting would be futile. His tired body was already being supported by spiritual power; he just took the opportunity to close his eyes and rest for a while.\n\nIt wasn't long before Fatty had flown out of the city with Niànbīng and landed lightly in an open space. He casually placed Niànbīng on the ground. Niànbīng opened his eyes and saw Fatty looking at him with a mischievous grin. His vigilance instantly soared. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\nFatty rubbed his large, fan-like hands together, his bones cracking. He chuckled, saying, \"After eating, one always needs to move around a bit. Using you as a punching bag should be a good choice. Don't worry, I have a good sense of proportion with my hands; I definitely won't beat you to death. After all, I'll need to find you in ten days, right?\"\n\nJust as Niànbīng was about to retort, a sudden great force came from his chest and abdomen. His body immediately flew up, defying gravity, as if a ball of fire was burning between his chest and stomach. The surging energy nearly tore his body apart. If Garamandes hadn't reformed his body back then, Niànbīng might have been finished with just this one punch. Fatty had no intention of letting Niànbīng go. He soared into the air, instantly caught up to Niànbīng, and punched him flying again. After taking this punch, Niànbīng felt his vision go black, his six senses simultaneously weakened to their lowest point, as if everything around him had vanished. The next moment, his body shuddered again, and finally, his six senses left his body. Niànbīng's last feeling before losing consciousness was release.\n\nA faint golden light emanated from Fatty's body. His face was very calm. Each time Niànbīng was sent flying by a punch, a faint golden light would seep into his body. Niànbīng's body would twist in the direction of the force. Fatty didn't stop, continuously punching him, one after another. He acted with great measure, each punch directly permeating power into Niànbīng's body without damaging his bones.\n\nAfter a while, when Fatty sent Niànbīng flying with the one hundred and eighth punch, he finally stopped. He instantly caught up to Niànbīng's airborne body, grabbed him, and landed lightly, muttering to himself, \"So exhilarating, truly exhilarating! Playing human projectile^1 is really fun! You stinky kid, Fatty doesn't eat your food for nothing; you'll understand later. Hmm, there's no one here, so I'll just leave him here. Time to find a place to sleep.\" After a moment of hesitation, he dragged Niànbīng's body up from the ground, covered Niànbīng's body with a layer of golden light, and with a casual wave, Niànbīng's body directly phased into the ground, disappearing as if he had been buried alive. Fatty smiled slightly and said, \"You stinky kid, since your Heaven's Eye acupoint has opened, you should experience the innate feeling and let it nourish you fully.\"\n\nFatty left. Niànbīng, who had originally been knocked unconscious by the heavy punches, gradually regained consciousness due to the lack of air. The severe physical pain combined with the sensation of suffocation made him extremely uncomfortable. Everything around him was pitch black; he couldn't see anything. He tried to struggle but found his body tightly squeezed by the surrounding soil, utterly unable to break free. All sorts of unprecedented intense pain continuously invaded his body, his heart, and every inch of his skin. The feeling of suffocation became increasingly pronounced. His brain grew hazy from lack of oxygen. Was he going to die? Was he really going to die now?\n\nNo, I can't die! A strong will to survive made Niànbīng's mind clear again. What now? All he could rely on was magic. Thinking of this, he introspected his body. Due to consumption, the seven energy orbs within him had become extremely tiny. With a thought, Niànbīng immediately drew upon fire elements to explode upwards above his head. At the very least, he needed air to breathe to save his life.\n\nUnfortunately, the use of magic is not only related to the magical power within one's body but also greatly dependent on the fire elements in the air. Buried underground, the fire elements were extremely sparse. Through his mental perception, Niànbīng despairingly realized that only extremely tiny flames rose above him, and he simply couldn't blast open the soil above. At this point, it wasn't just a matter of magical power. He couldn't see, couldn't hear, couldn't speak; he simply couldn't chant a larger spell to help himself. The feeling of suffocation grew stronger and stronger, and the shadow of death enveloped his body and mind.\n\nThe thoughts in his brain gradually became hazy. He had lost the ability to think, and his consciousness likewise plunged into darkness. All his bodily functions were deteriorating towards failure. He felt a little bewildered. Was he really going to die here? As the breath of life gradually vanished and he approached death, the pain of suffocation actually lessened significantly. His body felt light and airy, as if some sound was calling to him, urging him towards the end of death. Was this what death felt like? Did people truly have souls? Was his soul leaving his body?\n\nJust as Niànbīng's life was about to completely end, suddenly, he clearly felt a violent tremor throughout his body. An exceptionally cold sensation instantly swept over him. The perception of his body, previously lost, reappeared. Without needing to breathe, his internal functions restarted. The cool sensation originated precisely from his brow center. Simultaneously, wisps of cool air began to seep into his body from his skin. Niànbīng was astonished to find that his body had entered a strange state of internal respiration. His body gradually lit up from within; every meridian was incredibly clear. The magic energy orbs in his chest and abdomen began to spin faster. What surprised him most was the transparent orb at his brow center; it actually emitted a faint spiritual power. Through the perception of this spiritual power, his mental sensing rapidly spread outwards. Through this third eye, he clearly saw the surrounding soil, everything contained within the soil, and even the patterns on some tiny stones in the soil. His mental sensing continued to extend, even breaking through the soil. Niànbīng felt a sudden illumination in his mind, and everything in the outside world was clearly presented in his brain—an extraordinarily wondrous feeling.\n\nAs wisps of cool sensation continuously infiltrated his body, Niànbīng found his mental sensing growing stronger, and the speed of his qi and blood circulation also gradually increased. The cool sensation nourished every part of his body. Although his magical power hadn't noticeably increased, Niànbīng could feel his body undergoing a transformation. The severe pain he had felt was gradually disappearing, and faint golden light even appeared in the blood circulating within him. Tiny golden specks gradually integrated into his meridians as his blood circulated, then entered his bones through the meridians, finally lingering on the skin's surface before dissolving. Following this comfortable sensation came a sense of power. Niànbīng had never felt so full of strength before. Breaking out of the soil was no longer difficult, but at this moment, he was no longer in a hurry to leave. The continuously incoming cool sensation from his surroundings was indescribably comfortable. Since that was the case, why should he rush to leave now?\n___\n^1.

    "content": "Time passed minute by minute. Nian Bing entered a strange state; that faint, cool aura continuously emanated. He gave up perception of his body, instead fully immersing himself in meditation. Through the continuous strengthening of his spiritual power, he attracted the magic elements in the air on the ground to seep underground, then draw them into his body, enhancing his magic power. Cultivating this way was a first for Nian Bing, but as his magic power gradually increased, he found that not only was the speed of his magic power growth not slower than usual, but it was also a very good exercise for his spiritual power. The Celestial Eye Pearl<sup>1</sup> between his eyebrows felt completely transparent. Nian Bing found that, through the connection of spiritual power, he could already freely control the spiritual power within the Celestial Eye Pearl. Under the nurturing within the Celestial Eye Pearl, the growth rate of his spiritual power was extremely fast. The first manifestation of the spiritual power's increase was the enhancement of perception. All perceptions became exceptionally clear, and the sense of control over everything around him was so wonderful.\n\nGradually, his cultivation entered a wondrous cycle. No longer using his will to control, his body naturally reached a harmonious cultivation state. Nian Bing did not know that this kind of cultivation, which cut off external breathing, under the influence of the Celestial Eye Acupoint, his body's various energies had already begun to transform towards the Xiantian (Pre-Heaven)<sup>2</sup> realm. Xiantian and Houtian (Post-Heaven)<sup>3</sup> are completely different realms, especially the aura of their energies. Let alone him, even his grandfather, the Flame Fanjian<sup>4</sup> Lion King Rong Yan, had not entered the Xiantian realm. The advantage of the Xiantian realm<sup>5</sup> is that it can naturally attract all Houtian energies for one's own use.\n\nHaving entered a fixed cultivation state, Nian Bing no longer paid attention. Instead, he began contemplating everything that had happened to him recently, especially the impact the fat man had on him. Nian Bing had also seen many powerful individuals, like his grandfather, the Flame Lion King, who had already entered the strongest realm for mages, the Divine Descender. Like his recently recognized godmother, Yu Ru Yan, who was a powerful Martial Saint. However, neither Rong Yan nor Yu Ru Yan, compared to that fat man, were quite as strong. At least, in front of Rong Yan and Yu Ru Yan, he still had some ability to contend. But the feeling this fat man brought him was infinite pressure, not even a shred of opportunity. This feeling he had only experienced from the Fire Dragon King Galamandis. It was just that Galamandis had never shown any powerful strength in front of him, so the feeling wasn't obvious. At this moment, Nian Bing truly believed in Galamandis. If he had been by his side, he wouldn't have suffered such a great loss. What to do now? Wanting to rescue Feng Nü with his own strength was definitely not something that could be done in a day or two. But Feng Nü was always kept locked up by that fat man. It was hard to predict what effect it would have on her. Rescuing Feng Nü as quickly as possible was his top priority. Since he couldn't do it himself, he would have to rely on external forces. Thinking this, Nian Bing had already determined his path forward.\n\nFrom the time his magic power underwent mutation until now, Nian Bing hadn't had time to carefully consider the situation after the change in his magic power. In addition, the various knowledge his grandfather had imparted to him, as well as things he had seen in the library, all required time for careful thought before they could be integrated with the magic he specialized in. Now was the perfect time; he could cultivate while thinking about these issues.\n\nTime passed, day by day. Underground, Nian Bing was already completely immersed in cultivation and contemplation, without any perception of the outside world. He didn't know how much time had passed. His scattered spiritual power suddenly stirred, and his third eye clearly saw the fat man descend from the sky, landing right above his head.\n\nThe fat man looked at the ground with a surprised expression and muttered to himself, \"Good kid, to actually stay buried for ten days straight. It seems he truly has grasped the mysteries of the Xiantian realm. Kid, come on out.\" As he spoke, he pressed his single hand down towards the ground, then cupped his palm inward and lifted it upwards. Nian Bing felt a great force transmit, and the surrounding mud could no longer form an obstruction. His body instantly broke through the soil. Everything became bright. Returning to the surface, Nian Bing felt a floating, ethereal sensation throughout his body, as if his weight no longer existed. He lightly floated down onto the ground.\n\nThe fat man looked at Nian Bing and couldn't help but reveal a faint smile. At this moment, although Nian Bing was covered in mud and his clothes were tattered beyond recognition, his pair of deep blue eyes had become exceptionally bright, radiating captivating brilliance within their brightness. A ring of seven-colored light slowly rotated around his body. Although not obvious, it could still be clearly perceived.\n\nAfter Nian Bing emerged from the ground, he also had a wondrous feeling. The surrounding air was no longer merely simple air. Various magic elements joyfully surged towards his body. Without needing to meditate, without needing to go into a room to cultivate, these magic elements actually naturally flowed into his body through his skin, merging with the magic power within him. Although these magic elements were not strong, being able to condense them without cultivating was something Nian Bing had never imagined. In fact, this was the advantage of the Xiantian realm. Xiantian had a strong attraction to all Houtian energies. After his life underground, with the help of the Celestial Eye Acupoint, Nian Bing had transformed from a Houtian body to Xiantian. That was why this current situation occurred.\n\nThe fat man chuckled and said, \"Kid, haven't seen you in ten days, you've transformed quite a bit! Let's see if you can give me some surprises today.\"\n\nNian Bing said with some surprise, \"Has it really been ten days? I felt like only two or three days had passed.\"\n\nThe fat man pouted and said, \"I usually wake up once every ten days when I sleep. Am I not clearer about this than you? Time naturally fades during cultivation. Come on, let me see the changes in your magic.\"\n\nTaking a deep breath of fresh air, Nian Bing said, \"Wait a moment first. Let Feng Nü out so I can see her. Unless I'm sure of her safety, I won't fight you.\"\n\nThe fat man waved his big hand, and amidst a flash of light, Feng Nü gracefully appeared beside him. Her mind was clearly awake now. The moment she saw Nian Bing, deep affection immediately flowed from her eyes. Although she couldn't speak, her concern was evident, as if she was asking Nian Bing something. Seeing Feng Nü again, Nian Bing subconsciously rushed forward, \"Feng Nü.\"\n\nWith a flash of light, Feng Nü's figure vanished again. The fat man's mountain-like body blocked Nian Bing's path. \"Kid, missing your wife already? Then try your best to defeat me first.\"\n\nNian Bing stood firm, let out a cold snort, and said, \"Alright, you want to fight. Then let's fight.\" Seven-colored light flickered, and seven magic blades simultaneously appeared in mid-air. Nian Bing cast a Haste spell on himself and drifted backward. Immediately after, the seven blades landed simultaneously. He calmly chanted: \"Ice, you are the emblem of coldness; Fire, you are the source of scorching heat. Auras of Ice and Fire, please allow me to merge your characteristics, guided by your common origin. Resonate!\" The Ice-Fire Co-origin Hexagram and the seven magic blades simultaneously descended. Seven completely different magic auras—Ice, Fire, Earth, Wind, Space, Light, and Darkness—suddenly flared with the appearance of the hexagram. The magic elements in the air rapidly condensed in this direction. The originally active magic elements gradually became violent. A faint barrier of ethereal mist, woven from seven colors, formed in front of Nian Bing. Under the effect of the Xiantian realm, magic elements not only condensed on the seven magic blades, but also converged even faster towards Nian Bing's body. The surging magic elements continuously strengthened Nian Bing's magic power. The feeling of being full of energy greatly boosted his confidence. He also wanted to see what growth his magic had achieved after ten days of cultivation. Through the Celestial Eye Pearl, Nian Bing clearly perceived<sup>6</sup> all fluctuations of magic elements around him. With a thought, the Dawn Holy Radiance Blade, which pierced the heavens and earth, gently settled into his hand. Its tip obliquely pointed at the hilt of the True Sun Blade stuck in the ground. Golden radiance, illuminated by the Flame God Stone on the True Sun Blade, enveloped it in a faint red glow.\n\nThe fat man still stood there, clearly having no intention of attacking Nian Bing, quietly waiting for his attack. Nian Bing took another deep breath and calmly chanted: \"Ascend! Holy Light that pierces the heavens and earth! You represent endless light, illuminating the earth. Transform, aura of Holy Light! Amidst the radiance of Ice-Fire Co-origin, radiate your divine brilliance. Holy Light!\" The holy white light on the Holy Radiance Blade instantly surged to its peak, illuminating the entire hall as if it were daytime. Holy Light, this was the Holy Light that purifies all, an eighth-tier Light-element attack magic. Gentle and sacred ethereal halos continuously condensed as Nian Bing slowly raised the Holy Radiance Blade. The fat man was surprised to find that Nian Bing was actually compressing the Holy Light. Compressing an eighth-tier magic was not an easy feat. It was simply impossible without immense spiritual power control. Clearly, during these ten days of cultivation, Nian Bing's spiritual power had made great progress.\n\nWith a slight smile, a faint cold glint appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. He loudly chanted: \"Burn, heartless flame.\" Red flames soared from the Flame God Stone, instantly transforming into blue True Fire. The blue flames continuously expanded. Nian Bing did not continue chanting the incantation, but instead used the Holy Light on the Holy Radiance Blade in his hand to absorb the blue flames. Milky white radiance colored the blue flames. The Holy Radiance Blade in Nian Bing's hand burst forth with a five-zhang<sup>7</sup> long blade-aura. The aura of the magic elements seemed to have gone mad. At this moment, a glistening luster radiated from Nian Bing's eyes, and a white light shone from his brow. His spiritual power instantly rose to its limit, still continuously compressing the Holy Light infused with blue flames.\n\nThe fat man frowned as he looked at Nian Bing and said, \"Kid, your magic is strong, yes, but do you think your magic can hit me? Don't forget how your last magic scroll was used up.\"\n\nHearing the fat man mention the magic scroll, Nian Bing's eyelid couldn't help but twitch. He nearly lost control of the immense energy in his hand. He coldly said, \"You damn fatty, if I couldn't hit you, would I be putting in this much effort?\" The five-zhang blue-white blade-aura had already shrunk to four zhang under Nian Bing's continuous effort. At this moment, the immense burden already made Nian Bing feel somewhat strained. An eighth-tier magic infused with blue True Fire had a power level of ninth-tier or higher. Moreover, with the unique properties of fusion magic, this spell surpassed the ninth-tier. Compressing such a powerful magic with spiritual power, even though Nian Bing's spiritual power had reached a new realm, the rate of consumption was still extremely considerable. He slowly stepped forward. Under the immense pressure, Nian Bing's foot left a one-inch deep footprint on the ground.\n\nWith a backhand pull, under the influence of spiritual power and magic power, the True Sun Blade, burning with blue True Flame, fell into Nian Bing's left hand. The backs of the two magic blades lightly collided. The Holy Radiance Blade's original blue flames were drawn back by the True Sun Blade. The blue flames instantly soared, and their surging energy, in terms of power, surprisingly did not seem inferior to the Holy Light evoked by an incantation.\n\nThe fat man revealed a surprised expression for the first time. \"This is the first time I've seen an eighth-tier magic used like this—using light to ignite burning flames, then compressing it with spiritual power before unleashing it. Good kid, you really have some tricks up your sleeve. But I'd like to see how you can make it so I can't dodge, hehehehe.\"\n\nAs soon as the fat man's voice fell, Nian Bing moved. He simultaneously extended both arms horizontally to his sides and walked step by step towards the fat man. When he was still three zhang away from the fat man, he simultaneously flipped his wrists and swung his hands forward.\n\n\"Where Ghost Hand descends, heaven and earth transform; sculpted into a hundred swirling waves. Divine craftsmanship from ages past, now here; blade rises, crescent moon reflected in the cold spring.\" With his right hand, under the effect of the milky white flames, nine gigantic light dragons appeared. They were ethereal dragons carrying a holy aura. The sound of dragon roars continuously echoed, completely sealing off all escape routes for the fat man.\n\nSeeing the sudden appearance of the light dragons, the fat man was startled. A strange expression appeared on his chubby face, full of fat, and he subconsciously retreated a step. At this point, Nian Bing's movements had not ended.\n\n\"Ghost-bewildered moon halo, ice stream shattered; sculpted into a green phoenix returning to its parasol tree. A divine melody, pure notes turn; blade rings, clouds move, startling birds fly.\" With his left hand, under the baptism of blue True Fire, nine gigantic blue phoenixes appeared. The phoenixes' flames filled the gaps between the nine dragons. In an instant, dragons and phoenixes sang in unison, bringing forth countless surging auras. Light and flames perfectly merged. Within a five-zhang radius, with the fat man at its center, he was completely enveloped by the nine dragons and nine phoenixes. Blue-white light continuously surged and danced. The two originally eighth-tier magics had, under the effect of fusion, surged to tenth-tier and above.\n\n\"Dragon and Phoenix Light Flames of the Dragon Yu Collection Dance.\" The light of the nine dragons and nine phoenixes instantly swallowed the area where the fat man was.\n\nFrom within the light, the fat man's voice came out, \"Damn it, that brat still has such an ultimate move.\" Boom----, before the huge explosion occurred, Nian Bing had already retreated dozens of zhang away with his Haste spell.\n\n***\n<sup>1</sup> Celestial Eye Pearl (天眼珠): A mystical pearl, often associated with a third eye or enhanced spiritual perception.\n<sup>2</sup> Xiantian (先天): In cultivation novels, refers to the 'Pre-Heaven' or 'Innate' realm/state of being, often representing a higher, purer form of energy and existence.\n<sup>3</sup> Houtian (後天): In cultivation novels, refers to the 'Post-Heaven' or 'Acquired' realm/state, representing a lower, more mundane form of energy.\n<sup>4</sup> Fanjian (犯賤): The literal translation of \"犯賤\" is complex and can mean \"to seek humiliation,\" \"to behave in a demeaning way,\" or sometimes in a more playful context, \"mischievous.\" Its inclusion in a character's title is unusual and may be a deliberate quirk by the author or a textual error in the original.\n<sup>5</sup> The original text here reads \"先天獻身四化\" (xiāntiān xiànshēn sìhuà), which literally translates to \"Xiantian dedicating oneself to the Four Modernizations.\" This is a known political slogan from modern Chinese history and is almost certainly a typo in the original text, likely for \"先天境界\" (Xiantian realm/state).

    "content": "Nian Bing's attack this time was launched after careful consideration. Although it seemed to cover a vast magical range, once it made contact with the target, the power of the Nine Dragons Nine Phoenixes would immediately converge on a single point under the control of his mental strength, making it a single-target attack magic. It was also the most powerful single-target attack magic Nian Bing could conceive, and he believed his control over it was impeccable.\n\nAmidst a deafening roar, streaks of light flashed, and surging magical elements erupted wildly. Auras flickered, and the power unleashed by the dragon and phoenix flames, on the surface, did not seem as strong as the two ninth-tier spells used last time with Ice and Fire Homogeneity. However, the actual attack power was much greater; firstly, due to compression, and secondly, due to the concentrated attack under control. To breach powerful defenses, concentrating the attack on a single point was the best method.\n\nAs the auras gradually dissipated, the Fatty, covered in dust and grime, leaped out of a pit over a zhang deep. Due to underestimating the attack, he ended up covered in dust, but that was all it was — just dust.\n\nNian Bing's eyes widened as he watched the Fatty, whose clothes were completely undamaged, dusting himself off. A feeling of powerlessness welled up within him. Such an attack couldn't even harm him. Could his layer of fat be some kind of armor? Even if it were armor, it couldn't possibly withstand an attack like this.\n\n\"I give up. I surrender.\" Nian Bing shook his head helplessly. The Fatty looked at Nian Bing approvingly and said, \"Kid, you're much stronger this time than last. At least you know how to use single-point attacks now, and you even made it impossible for me to dodge. But do you think magic has to be flashy? Dazzling magical effects only consume more magic power. If you could have condensed your magic into a single point just now, maybe it really would have given me some trouble. You surrendered, huh? Good, let's go. Back to that city to continue cooking for me. The spiritual energy in this area is plentiful, and sleeping here is very comfortable. I've decided. You don't have to leave this place until you can beat me. Have you decided what to cook for me today? My demands aren't high; just a little better than last time will do.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned deeply. \"Didn't you say you'd go wherever I go? How come you're going back on your word again?\" He had already made up his mind. After leaving this place, he would immediately head towards the Aolan Empire. Once he reached Yu Ruyan, with the combined strength of Yu Ruyan and her husband, plus his own, they might be able to rescue Feng Nü. But now that the Fatty had said this, even though he hadn't explicitly restricted him, his words were like a cage, making it impossible for him to leave.\n\nThe Fatty smiled slightly, looking at Nian Bing. \"Kid, don't think about anything bad. If you want to save your wife, you'll have to rely on yourself. Let's go. This time you still have magic power left. I don't need to carry you flying, right? I've been asleep for ten days, and I'm starving. The money I got last time should be enough for ingredients.\"\n\nNian Bing glared fiercely at the Fatty. \"Alright, you win. But be careful. Your external defense might be strong, but your internal body defense might not be. Be careful, or I'll poison you to death.\"\n\n…\n\nTwo months later.\n\nThe Langmu Plains. As the most famous plains on the Continent of Yangguang, this fertile land nurtured tens of millions of Langmu Empire citizens. The Langmu Plains were not only flat but also crisscrossed by multiple large rivers, and their geographical elevation was not high. Under the influence of various combined conditions, the plains' soil was extremely fertile, sufficient for the growth of all kinds of plants. The Langmu Empire's national grain production resources almost entirely originated from the Langmu Plains. It could be said that the Langmu Plains were the granary of the Langmu Empire.\n\nThe Langmu Plains were located in the southern part of the Langmu Empire, occupying more than one-third of the country's total area. To protect this greatest wealth of the Langmu Empire and guard against the Huarong Empire, the Langmu Empire stationed heavy troops near the Sirius Mountain Range at the edge of the Langmu Plains.\n\nIt was also fortunate for the Langmu Empire that at the border between the Langmu Empire and the Huarong Empire, the Sirius Mountain Range served as a natural demarcation line between the two nations. The mountains stretching across the border occupied almost three-quarters of the two countries' shared boundary. The remaining one-quarter had, through years of effort by the Langmu Empire, been fortified with a sturdy fortress. Built against the mountains, the fortress still housed a full 200,000 troops, leveraging its geographical advantage.* They were truly on high alert, constantly prepared to meet the Huarong Empire's attacks.\n\nIt was precisely because of the Langmu Empire's immense defensive system that the Huarong Empire had never had an opportunity to breach the fortress and enter the Langmu Plains to plunder. However, this situation* ended a month ago.\n\nA month ago, the Huarong Empire suddenly launched* a surprise attack on the Langmu Empire. The Huarong Empire's Northern Army Group remained stationary, but 100,000 troops surged out from their rear. The Northern Army Group then dispatched 200,000 troops to follow the Central Army Group, with all movements proceeding extremely quickly, clearly indicating a pre-meditated plan. This expedition by the Central Army Group was personally led by Prince Rong, commanding the Flame Lion Knights and the Central Army Group's most elite light and heavy cavalry units. The 100,000 strong army was entirely composed of cavalry. The equipment and expenses of this force were almost equivalent to half of the Huarong Empire's total military expenditure.\n\nThe Huarong Empire's four army groups each had a strength of 300,000. The 200,000 dispatched troops, combined with the 100,000 personally led by Prince Rong, a full 300,000 men, rushed towards the Sirius Mountain Range at the fastest possible speed. The 100,000 cavalry led by Prince Rong advanced first, but instead of assaulting the fortress built by the Langmu Empire, they chose another direction. It was precisely for this reason* that the Langmu Empire was caught completely off guard.\n\nThe method used by the Huarong Empire was extreme. It wasn't until after this war ended that the Langmu Empire understood what the Huarong Empire had done: they used the simplest method to employ, yet also the most difficult—bombing mountains.\n\nHundreds of fire-element mages, led by Prince Rong, launched massive, successive bombardments with powerful fire-element magic at the thinnest part of the Sirius Mountain Range. Especially with the forbidden spell personally cast by Prince Rong, in just one full day, they actually leveled three mountains over three hundred zhang tall, forcibly carving out a path a hundred zhang wide through the center of the Sirius Mountain Range. Through this path, the cavalry army led by Prince Rong directly stormed into the heart of the Langmu Plains.\n\nBy the time the Langmu Empire noticed, Prince Rong's army had already successively breached three defensive lines of the Langmu Plains and entered the fertile land. At this time, another 200,000 Huarong Empire troops had also entered the Langmu Empire. This army was led by Prince Rong's eldest son, Rong Yue. The army led by Prince Rong did not stop at all except for fighting; they only plundered enough resources for supplies and then continued deeper into the Langmu Plains. Meanwhile, the 200,000 troops led by Rong Yue were responsible for the mop-up operations. Various plundered resources were transported back to the Huarong Empire's interior via the newly opened passage at the fastest speed. Their actions could only be described with the two words: bandits.\n\nThis move shocked the entire Langmu Empire. The King of the Langmu Empire immediately dispatched large armies to encircle and annihilate Prince Rong's 100,000 cavalry. But who was Prince Rong? It could be said that at least half of the Huarong Empire's domain was conquered by him. When it came to marching and fighting, how many people in the current era could compare to him? Relying on the flexibility of his cavalry, he avoided the main forces of the Langmu Empire, specifically seeking out and encircling small Langmu Empire units for annihilation. Furthermore, his methods were extremely peculiar. Once he approached a small enemy unit and they surrendered, he would not kill them. Instead, he would order them to leave all their resources, equipment, and horses, then drive them away, causing these disarmed troops and civilians to flee in all directions, plunging the entire Langmu Plains into chaos.\n\nIt wasn't that the Langmu Empire didn't counterattack the Huarong Empire after Prince Rong led the Northern Army Group's large-scale invasion. However, when their troops garrisoned at the fortress rushed to the Northern Army Group's position, they suddenly discovered that 150,000 troops from the Huarong Empire's Northeastern Army Group had already been incorporated into the Northern Army Group, making their defense impregnable. Let alone breaching their defenses, in the ensuing battles, the Langmu Empire suffered losses of nearly 50,000 soldiers before they could retreat back to the fortress. The treacherous cunning of Demon Commander Arc Light made the Langmu Empire's army suffer greatly.\n\nHowever, the Langmu Empire was, after all, a powerful nation on the Continent of Yangguang, second only to Huarong. After nearly half a month of panic, they finally organized a blockade, amassing nearly 700,000 troops, and gradually put pressure on Prince Rong's 100,000-strong army in a pincer movement. They also dispatched their six most elite cavalry orders as the main force, supplemented by master mages. The King of the Langmu Empire had issued a death order, vowing to keep Prince Rong and the Flame Lion Knights in the Langmu Plains at all costs.\n\n\"Report!\" A scout quickly rushed into the main tent and knelt before Prince Rong.\n\nPrince Rong calmly said, \"Speak.\"\n\n\"Yes, reporting to Your Highness, the Langmu Empire's main army is less than a hundred li from us, and among them, the six great Knight Orders of Glory, Beacon Fire, Thorn Tiger, Raging Dragon, Silver Armor, and Blood Kill are less than fifty li from our unit.\"\n\n\"Good, scout again.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The scout hurried out.\n\nPrince Rong's two younger brothers, Rong Nian and Rong Fei, both also Archmages, stood in the main tent. After hearing the scout's report, Rong Fei said, \"Big Brother, shouldn't we make a move? Fifty li is a distance that elite cavalry can cover in at most an hour. I didn't expect them to be so close to us already.\"\n\nPrince Rong smiled calmly and said, \"I ordered a two-day rest here precisely to let them get closer. Otherwise, how would they find our exact position? Don't worry, my Flame Lion Knights are not something anyone dares to attack. And those six cavalry orders' overall strength isn't as good as ours. If I'm not mistaken, they won't act rashly before the Langmu Empire's main forces arrive. Rong Bing, what's the situation with our army now?\"\n\nFor this great battle, Prince Rong had specifically brought Rong Bing and Rong Ji, two of the most outstanding younger generation from the Rong family's third generation, with him. Rong Bing was in charge of the army's logistical supplies.\n\n\"Our current active strength stands at 87,000 cavalry, with 20,000 heavy cavalry and the rest light cavalry. The fallen and wounded have already been sent back home via the Northern Army Group's supply line. The Flame Lion Knights have had minimal casualties due to their infrequent engagements. These numbers do not include special forces.\"\n\nPrince Rong nodded, glanced at the dozens of high-ranking generals in the tent, smiled calmly, and said, \"Our first mission on this expedition has been completed. Yesterday, Rong Yue sent word that the resources plundered this time are twice as much as we expected. The Langmu Empire truly is a wealthy nation! Now that Rong Yue's troops have returned home via the path we opened, it's time for us to withdraw after achieving our objectives. Second Brother, Third Brother, how is the recovery of our mages?\"*\n\nRong Nian said, \"Due to the mountain-blasting operation last time, our mages' consumption was very high, so they haven't been deployed in battle these past few days. They have now largely recovered. Big Brother, casting the forbidden spell last time also took a considerable toll on you. How is your recovery now?\"\n\nPrince Rong calmly replied, \"I'm fine. Since our mages have all recovered, it's time for them to make some noise. At the same time, the secret forces are on standby, ready to launch an attack. Before leaving these fertile plains, I want to make sure the Langmu Empire remembers that we were here. I believe that in the not-so-distant future of the Langmu Empire's history, they will remember this war well.\"\n\nRong Nian laughed. \"They probably remember it very well already. That kid Rong Yue is truly something; this time, he practically dug three feet into the ground. Anything that could be plundered, not a single bit was left behind!\"\n\nPrince Rong smiled slightly. \"Exactly. The resources plundered this time are enough to cover our military expenses for several years. The Langmu Empire truly is a fat sheep. Alright, deploy according to the original plan. Second Brother, Third Brother, you will accompany me to face the enemy.\" To remain so calm when facing an army of 700,000 with fewer than 90,000 men, perhaps only Prince Rong could do it.\n\nHalf an hour later, Prince Rong, accompanied by Rong Nian and Rong Fei, with several elderly men with solemn faces and golden lion emblems embroidered on their chests standing behind them, gazed into the distance. This was a plain, and gazing as far as the eye could see, one could make out distant points. Though still tens of li away, the rolling dust clouds raised by the Langmu Empire's main army were already visible.\n\nNearly 700,000 troops, like an overwhelming tide, formed a large net in a semi-encircling posture, pressing forward at an extremely fast pace. Behind Prince Rong was the continent-renowned Flame Lion Knights. This premier knight order on the continent was extremely well-equipped. Apart from their dedicated fire-element mages, all knights wore fiery red light armor, carried a twenty-foot-long red knight's spear, and a four-foot-long broad-bladed cavalry saber. Even their mounts were uniformly date-red. Arranged neatly there, they looked like a fiery cloud settling on the plains.\n\nBehind the Flame Lion Knights were the remaining 70,000-plus elite Huarong Empire cavalry. Among these, 20,000 heavy cavalry guarded the flanks, with light cavalry in the center. Combined with the Flame Lion Knights in front, the entire formation created a sharp triangle, clearly an assault formation.\n\n---\n*Translator's notes:\n*  \"geographical advantage\" (地理優勢): The original Chinese text uses \"地理公交車\" (dìlǐ gōngjiāochē), literally \"geographical public bus,\" which is almost certainly a typo. \"Geographical advantage\" is a more fitting interpretation given the context.\n*  \"this situation\" (這樣的書面): The original Chinese text uses \"這樣的書面\" (zhèyàng de shūmiàn), literally \"such written (situation).\" This is likely an awkward phrasing or typo, possibly intended to mean \"this status quo\" or \"this established situation.\"\n*  \"launched\" (屐了奇襲 / 屐了衝擊): The character \"屐\" (jī) means \"clogs\" or \"wooden shoes.\" This is a clear typo in the original text, likely intended to be \"襲\" (xí, attack) or \"展開了\" (zhǎnkāile, launched/unfolded).\n*  \"It was precisely for this reason\" (也正題因為): The original Chinese text uses \"也正題因為\" (yě zhèngtí yīnwèi), where \"正題\" (zhèngtí) means \"main topic.\" This is likely a typo for \"正是因為\" (zhèng shì yīnwèi), meaning \"it is precisely because.\"\n*  \"our mages\" (我們的就是軍團 / 我們擺不正的就是): The phrase \"就是\" (jiùshì) is used repeatedly in these sentences in a context that suggests it refers to a specific group, likely the mages/spellcasters responsible for the mountain-blasting (開山).

    "content": "Facing a powerful enemy, Prince Rong seemed not to consider escaping; instead, he prepared for a head-on battle.\n\nThe rumbling sound intensified as the enemy gradually approached. Prince Rong smiled faintly and calmly said, \"Whole army prepare, Mages prepare, Blazing Prairies. Direction, straight ahead.\"\n\nLow chants almost simultaneously rose. A full five hundred Fire Mages of Grand Mage rank or higher began chanting the same spell. As flames condensed in the air, a vast red cloud truly appeared above the Blazing Lion Knights.\n\nPrince Rong rode a tall, magnificent horse. Although he was a Mage, he had loved horsemanship since childhood, and whenever he went to war with the army, he always rode on horseback.\n\nThe Langmu Empire's main army gradually approached. First to appear were six neat phalanxes, which were precisely the Langmu Empire's strongest six cavalry regiments. They were clearly very wary of the Huarong Empire's military corps. The six cavalry regiments were spread far apart, and their advance speed was not very fast, waiting for their supporting main army to catch up.\n\nThe Langmu Empire's main forces, at the front, were entirely composed of Heavy Cavalry and Heavy Infantry, looking like a moving steel Great Wall. As they gradually approached, they exuded immense oppressive power.\n\nThe Blazing Lion Knights themselves¹ were not riding separately. Five hundred Mages and five hundred of the most elite knights of the regiment all rode together on one horse. These horses were specially selected, with excellent carrying capacity and endurance. The Knights also carried five hundred empty horses, so that once the war ended, the Mages could return to their own mounts. This way, they could fully unleash their power during the war.\n\nThe Dwarves² gradually drew near, and the magic condensed by the Blazing Lion Knights was also fully formed. Prince Rong smiled faintly and said, \"Since they have arrived, let's give them a little greeting gift first. Blazing Prairies, unleash.\"\n\nAfter he gave the order, the vast red cloud drifted up gracefully, instantly crossing the plains, floating towards the enemy who had approached within ten li. The Langmu Empire seemed to have prepared for the Huarong Empire's magical attack. Magic lights of various colors rose within their ranks. Clearly, their Mages were not all fire-attributed like the Huarong Empire's. Various magic shields appeared, obstructing in front of their ranks, while the six cavalry regiments at the very front split into two groups, rapidly retreating towards the flanks of the main army. Once their defenses³ were unable to withstand the Huarong Empire's magical attack, then those heavy armored soldiers would have to use their bodies to contend for the Mages⁴.\n\nPrince Rong smiled faintly. \"Even a grain of rice can shine⁵! Group magic warfare requires perfect coordination.\" As he spoke, he also immediately began chanting spells along with his two younger brothers beside him. Three clusters of purple flames began to burn at the tip of the wedge formation created by the Blazing Lion Knights.\n\nThe ground vibrated violently as the magic made contact. The immense explosive power generated by the collision of dazzling magic lights in the air was absolutely the most beautiful fireworks. The red cloud, as if filled with corrosive power, continuously broke through layer after layer of multi-colored light. With each layer of defense broken, the red cloud drew closer to the ground.\n\nJust as both sides were in a stalemate, one deep and two shallow, three magical giant lions, each over five zhang in length, charged before the Langmu Empire's forces. The three Heavenly Fire Lions seemed to encounter no resistance, easily tearing through layer after layer of defense, directly rushing into the ranks of the heavy armored soldiers. Those were two Tenth-Tier spells plus one Eleventh-Tier Forbidden Spell. The Langmu Empire's Mages were already on the verge of collapsing; facing such a formidable impact, how could they possibly resist?\n\nIn an instant, wherever the Heavenly Fire Lions passed, only charred remains were left. The red cloud in the sky also gracefully descended, having no more enemy to contend with. Immediately, the entire vanguard army of the Langmu Empire was completely engulfed in a sea of flames. It truly lived up to its name, Blazing Prairies!\n\nPrince Rong raised his right hand and roared, \"Charge!\" The three Golden Lion Elders who were originally behind him rushed out first. He and his two younger brothers followed closely behind. Nearly ninety thousand troops, like a sharp arrow, accelerated continuously as they charged towards the Langmu Empire's vast military corps.\n\nThe power of group magic combined with a Forbidden Spell was absolutely terrifying. The magical attack alone had already taken the lives of at least thirty thousand Langmu Empire soldiers—those were completely the most precious heavy armored soldiers!\n\nSeeing the Huarong Empire's cavalry regiment's charge, the Langmu Empire immediately reacted with the utmost speed. For a moment, colorful banners fluttered. The originally dispersed six cavalry regiments, truly elite among elites, astonishingly converged with the fastest speed, fearlessly charging towards the Blazing Lion Knights. Their objective was simple: as long as they destroyed the Blazing Lion Knights, then the Huarong Empire's army would no longer be a threat. With six elite cavalry regiments against the continent's foremost Blazing Lion Knights, they had at least seventy percent certainty, especially since the opposing Mages had just unleashed a large-area spell and could not continue attacking within a short time.\n\nThe cavalry of both sides continuously approached. The ten-li distance, under the charge of both sides, instantly shortened to five li, four li, three li. Just then, a sudden change occurred. A dazzling fireball shot out from Prince Rong's hand, exploding into millions of sparks in the air. The next moment, the originally neat formation of the Blazing Lion Knights suddenly split to both sides, creating a huge gap at the front of their original triangular formation.\n\nThe rumbling sound produced by the hooves seemed to intensify. A massive red mass instantly surged forward from the rear army, taking the place of the Blazing Lion Knights. The separated Blazing Lion Knights, meanwhile, reformed and merged together during a short two-li gallop, except now, the tip of the formation was no longer them.\n\nCharging at the very front of the Huarong Empire's cavalry regiment were five individuals, clad in full heavy armor. On the chest of their armor was the mark of a golden son. Each of them seemed to be ablaze with a cluster of red flames, their formidable aura fully released during the preceding accelerated charge. Most terrifyingly, what they rode were not horses, but dragons—Earth Dragons, the Iron-Backed Earth Dragons that had once nearly taken Nian Bing's life.\n\nThe Iron-Backed Earth Dragons, three zhang long and one and a half zhang tall, were completely covered in armor. However, this did not affect their powerful galloping ability. Each massive dragon claw striking the ground brought intense tremors. Even more terrifying was that it wasn't just the front five individuals riding Earth Dragons. Following behind them were a full three thousand Iron-Backed Earth Dragons. On the back of each Earth Dragon sat a cavalryman clad in full heavy armor. Each of them held a massive long lance, three zhang long and as thick as an arm. The lance tip at the front had four sharp blades behind it, each with deep blood grooves. These special lances were named Dragon Lances. And this three-thousand-strong troop was formed by Mages through continuous efforts. They were Prince Rong's true trump card, the continent's true foremost cavalry regiment, the Blazing Magic Dragon Knights.\n\nThree thousand. This number isn't vast. But if you add the words 'Earth Dragons' after three thousand, that is absolutely a byword for terror. Iron-Backed Earth Dragons, by themselves, possess exceptionally strong defensive capabilities. Coupled with the armor on their bodies and their inherent magical resistance, they are absolutely the nightmare of any army. What's more, on the back of each Earth Dragon also sat a knight of Grand Swordsman strength. The impact force they formed was absolutely something no human power could withstand.\n\nPrince Rong's previously commanded magical attacks and full army charges were all meant to build momentum for this cavalry regiment, which served as a secret weapon, to fully unleash their impact. After being in the Langmu Empire for so long, facing the enemy's elite, he finally dispatched this troop—this devil-like troop. When the overall formation reorganization was complete, the Blazing Magic Dragon Knights at the very front were less than one li away from the enemy. The Langmu Empire's six elite cavalry regiments had no time to react.\n\n\"Heavens! What is that thing?\" The Langmu Empire's commander stared blankly at the Blazing Magic Dragon Knights, who were about to make contact with his fighting personnel, and exclaimed in a lost voice. Immediately afterwards, he witnessed a horrifying scene. Five splendid streaks of light-flame burst forth from the five Dragon Lances at the very front. In an instant, the Blazing Magic Dragon Knights plunged into the Langmu Empire's six elite cavalry regiments.\n\nNo matter how elite a cavalry regiment was, they rode horses, while the opponents rode dragons. Once an Iron-Backed Earth Dragon charged, its terrifying weight, sturdy body, and insane speed meant that even experts of the Armored Grandmaster level would have to temporarily avoid its sharp edge, let alone the simultaneous charge of three thousand Earth Dragons?\n\nBoom-----! The entire battlefield was filled with the sound of breaking armor. The Blazing Magic Dragon Knights were like a giant blade, directly thrusting into the Langmu Empire's six cavalry regiments. For a moment, flesh and blood flew everywhere. The sheer impact of horizontally raised Dragon Lances, in a single encounter, had already taken the lives of at least several thousand Langmu Empire cavalrymen.\n\nThis battle was very comfortable for the Blazing Lion Knights. They only needed to take care of the remaining enemy forces on both sides of the Blazing Magic Dragon Knights. The former continent's foremost cavalry regiment, their quality was absolutely astonishing, especially after the enemy's spirits were broken, everything they did became even smoother.\n\nFrom the initial contact until the Blazing Magic Dragon Knights charged out of the Langmu Empire's six elite cavalry regiments, it took the time it takes to eat a meal⁶. When the Earth Dragons charged into the Langmu Empire's main forces in the rear, their proud six cavalry regiments had already ceased to exist. Not even a single horse was left. They were completely swallowed by the Huarong Empire's main army.\n\nJust then, a second wave of Blazing Prairies rose up, targeting the enemies outside the flanks of their own main army. The warriors of the Blazing Lion Knights had long since coordinated with incredible tacit understanding; even without Prince Rong's command, they knew what to do and when. With the protection of the Blazing Lion Knights and Mages on both flanks, the Blazing Magic Dragon Knights unleashed their strongest impact force. Even the Langmu Empire's Heavy Infantry Corps could not stop their charging speed. A full nearly seven hundred thousand strong army! It was astonishingly scattered and fragmented by the charge, utterly unable to exert its numerical advantage.\n\nIn just the time it takes to eat a meal⁶, Prince Rong astonishingly commanded his cavalry to charge straight through. Amid cheers, the Huarong Empire's main forces broke out of the encirclement. However, the war was not yet over.\n\nThe Langmu Empire's army had only been hastily dispatched from various defensive zones at the fastest speed during the emergency. They had not undergone any overall training. While they could still attack simultaneously without falling into disarray, after such a charge, their formation was completely scattered. Especially the soldiers who had witnessed the power of the Blazing Magic Dragon Knights with their own eyes were so terrified that they scattered and fled in all directions. Everything had spiraled out of control. And at this moment, the old but formidable⁷ Prince Rong still had no intention of letting them off.\n\nAfter charging ten li, the Blazing Magic Dragon Knights turned around and astonishingly led the entire cavalry force back to fight again. Once more, they plunged into the Langmu Empire's main army. This time, everything became even simpler.\n\nThe most famous battle in the history of Yangguang Continent was thus engraved with the name of the Blazing Magic Dragon Knights, and also with the name of Blazing Lion King Rongyan. This battle was called 'The Advent of the Magic Dragon' and also 'The Langmu Empire's Nightmare'. Prince Rong led the Blazing Magic Dragon Knights, Blazing Lion Knights, and elite cavalry regiments, totaling over eighty thousand people. In the end, nearly sixty thousand people safely broke out of the encirclement and escaped. The Blazing Magic Dragon Knights, as the vanguard, lost less than three hundred. The Blazing Lion Knights lost over a thousand people, and nearly a hundred Mages. The ordinary elite cavalry lost over twenty thousand people. Judging by this cost alone, it cannot be said to be small, but compared to the Langmu Empire, this cost can only be described as pitifully small.\n\nThe Langmu Empire, with a total of six hundred eighty thousand troops, including six fully organized elite cavalry regiments, suffered a total loss of two hundred sixty thousand. Among these, all six elite cavalry regiments were annihilated. Under the opponent's charge, a full two hundred thousand soldiers died beneath the iron hooves of the Huarong Empire. This battle severely weakened the Langmu Empire, making them not even dare to entertain the thought of pursuit. From then on, the once prosperous Langmu Empire's national strength greatly declined, and it no longer possessed the power to contend with the Huarong Empire.\n\nThe victory of this battle was indeed directly related to the sudden appearance and formidable strength of the Blazing Magic Dragon Knights. However, one must also acknowledge Prince Rong's deep cunning⁸. From the very beginning of the war, he created various situations within the Langmu Empire, astonishingly achieving the effect of leading them by the nose. He consistently denied them a decisive battle based in a city, choosing to fight on the plains where the opponent had constructed no defensive fortifications. Under such circumstances, cavalry held an absolute advantage, and relying on his powerful cavalry corps, he achieved a decisive victory.\n\nThe Langmu Empire lost. Later, when Mujing and Murong returned to the Langmu Empire's capital to summarize, they unanimously agreed that this battle was not lost on strength, but on tactics. If Prince Rong's cavalry regiments could have been lured into a city, or into a specially constructed terrain, even if the Blazing Magic Dragon Knights were stronger, they could not have so easily inflicted such immense damage. But whatever was said was too late. The facts were already laid bare. Caught off guard, and with no time to devise tactics, Langmu Plains was ravaged, and a total of over three hundred thousand troops were annihilated⁹. Such a result became the greatest humiliation in the history of the Langmu Empire.\n\n...\n\n---\n¹ The original Chinese phrase \"火焰獅子騎士團的就是們\" (huǒyàn shīzi qíshìtuán de jiùshìmen) is syntactically unusual; \"就是們\" literally means \"is them/are them\" or \"that is them.\" It is interpreted here as an emphatic way of referring to the members or core characteristics of the Blazing Lion Knights.\n² The original Chinese character \"矮人\" means \"Dwarves.\" This appears to be an inconsistency with the rest of the text, which consistently refers to the enemy as the Langmu Empire, implied to be a human force.\n³ The original phrase \"他們的就是\" (tāmen de jiùshì) is syntactically ambiguous. \"就是\" (jiùshì) here is used as an emphatic, likely implying \"their very defenses\" or \"their formation\" as the subject of the clause that follows.\n⁴ The original Chinese phrase \"那麼魔法師那些重裝甲士兵用身體來抗衡了\" (nàme mófǎshī nàxiē zhòngzhuāngjiǎ shìbīng yòng shēntǐ lái kànghéng le) has an ambiguous syntax. \"魔法師\" (Mages) could imply that the Mages' strategy or their front line of soldiers are involved, or that the heavy armored soldiers are acting on behalf of or to protect the Mages. This translation interprets it as the heavy armored soldiers shielding the Mages.\n⁵ **米粒之珠也放光華 (mǐ lì zhī zhū yě fàng guāng huá):** Literally \"Even a grain of rice can shine.\" This idiom suggests that something small or insignificant is trying to compete with or show off against something much larger or more powerful.\n⁶ **頓飯的工夫 (dùn fàn de gōng fū):** Literally \"the time it takes to eat a meal,\" an idiom indicating a short period of time, roughly 15-30 minutes.\n⁷ **老而彌辣 (lǎo ér mí là):** Literally \"old but still spicy/fierce.\" This describes someone who is old but remains formidable, shrewd, or cunning.\n⁸ **老謀深算 (lǎo móu shēn suàn):** Literally \"old scheme, deep calculation.\" Describes someone who is experienced, shrewd, and highly strategic or cunning.\n⁹ The original phrase \"前後三十餘萬軍隊被殲滅\" (qiánhòu sānshíyú wàn jūnduì bèi jiānmiè) uses \"前後\" (qiánhòu), which can mean \"before and after,\" \"around,\" or \"in total.\" In this military context, it most likely refers to the total number of troops annihilated over the course of the engagement.",

    "content": "When Prince Rong led his army in a three-month-long war against the Langmu Empire, Nian Bing, still within the borders of the Huarong Empire, remained utterly unaware of any of it. He continued to strive tirelessly to rescue Feng Nü, or rather, he strove in vain.\n\nMist and clouds drifted ethereally, like wisps of smoke, and with a gentle breeze, brought a touch of dampness to the mountaintop.\n\nThe mist and clouds passed, revealing the bare mountaintop. In the very center of the mountaintop, the Fatty sat on the ground, chewing on something. \"Ah, I’ve eaten my last chicken leg,\" he sighed. \"Why isn’t that guy here yet? Isn’t he deliberately whetting my appetite? It’s really not easy to get a grand feast from him. Heavens! Why isn’t he a woman? If he were, I’d marry her even if it cost me my old life, just so she could comfort my stomach every day.\" As he spoke, the Fatty rubbed his belly with his greasy large hand, his face filled with sorrowful sighs. However, sorrow on his fat, large face looked utterly comical.\n\n\"Hmph, Fatty, be careful. This time, I’m afraid you won’t just miss out on a Seven-Element Grand Feast; you might lose your life here.\" From the mist, a figure clad in gray cloth slowly walked out. It was Nian Bing. He didn’t look at the Fatty; his gaze rested on the seven brilliantly shining gems, as if they were his entire life. Three months had passed. Nian Bing’s enduring perseverance gradually emerged. In the grueling contests held every ten days, he fought and lost, yet lost and fought again. From having no ability to resist at all in the beginning, to now where the Fatty already showed some apprehension, his strength had soared dramatically over the past three months. Even Nian Bing himself wasn’t entirely clear what level his current strength had reached. But he had profoundly experienced the wondrous use of the Heavenly Eye Acupoint; it was indeed far beyond what an Innate Domain could compare to.\n\nFor the past three months, Nian Bing had faced a challenge every ten days. His battles with the Fatty had become almost formulaic: each time, he would first attack with all his might. The Fatty would resolve it with various methods, and when Nian Bing found himself unable to break through the Fatty's defenses, he could only concede defeat. The result of conceding defeat was cooking—dedicating himself to making all sorts of delicacies for the Fatty to eat. Through their continuous interactions, Nian Bing was surprised to discover that the Fatty possessed a deep and profound understanding of food, often offering Nian Bing various suggestions. His suggestions were not about picking bones from an egg*; each piece of advice hit precisely the crucial point. He was practically a seasoned gourmet. His constant suggestions led Nian Bing to continuously improve his culinary skills, finally creating the Seven-Element Grand Feast after the Nine Heavens of Ice and Fire Cuisine. The progress in his cooking was something Nian Bing hadn't anticipated. However, what pained Nian Bing was that every time he finished cooking for the Fatty, he would be subjected to a baptism of heavy punches, and then be beaten into the ground† by the Fatty, entering an Innate Realm for cultivation. While the beauty of cultivation was good, being violently beaten every ten days was not a comfortable experience. Fortunately, the Fatty's beatings never caused him actual harm.\n\nThe Fatty chuckled, \"That depends on your skill. You know, for food, this Fatty will fight with his life. As the saying goes: Shredded meat is precious, sliced meat is pricier, but if there’s a big chunk of meat, both can be thrown away.‡ Come on, come on, I reckon the grease in my belly is still enough to play with you one more round.\"\n\nNian Bing sighed, \"Fatty, why do you make things so difficult for me? Give me back Feng Nü. At worst, I’ll make you a Seven-Element Grand Feast for an entire month straight. If you don’t let me see Feng Nü, today I’ll even risk my life using Life Magic to keep you here. It’s been three months, and you haven’t let me see Feng Nü once. Today, I’m going all out.\"\n\nThe Fatty pinched his fleshy chin and said, \"That won’t do. If your heart has no anchor for your longing, the food you make will taste worse. Once I’ve tasted the best, how can you expect me to eat something inferior? To be honest, your talent, kid, is the best I’ve ever seen. To cultivate magic to your realm with a human body, it truly makes this Fatty very impressed! Kid, do you think you can even use Life Magic in front of me?\"\n\nNian Bing gave a bitter smile, \"You know perfectly well that I don’t practice magic to be a magician, but to make more delicious dishes. Besides, at most, I can only use eighth-tier magic; using ninth-tier magic already places a huge burden on me.\"\n\nThe Fatty shook his head and said, \"It’s different. Although you can only use eighth-tier magic, your control and understanding of magic are beyond what those so-called Archmages can compare to. Tell me, who among them can achieve Ice and Fire of the Same Origin, and use the power of Ice and Fire of the Same Origin to draw upon the essence of other magical elements to drive the other five magical elements—wind, earth, space, light, and darkness? Though only supplementary, you are the first full-element magician on the entire continent. I remember they called you. Indeed, your power fundamentally lies in ice and fire; this title suits you best. Furthermore, what I don’t understand is that your magic power progresses incredibly fast; logically, you should already be able to use higher-tier magic, so how is it that you’ve always remained at your original level? Haha! Today, I’m in for another delicious meal!\"\n\nNian Bing’s eyes gleamed with a cold light as he frowned, \"So, that means we still have to fight. Do you want to know why my magic has always remained at its original state? I only understood it these past few days, Fatty. Today, I’ll let you see the qualitative leap I’ve made in magic.\"\n\nThe Fatty chuckled, \"Of course, of course. I’m still waiting for my Seven-Element Grand Feast. Just like before, I’ll give you time to chant your spell. Go on, speak up. A little activity before a meal is indeed quite good. I seem to have gained quite a bit of weight recently. Let’s see how much impact your qualitative leap can have on me.\"\n\nNian Bing’s gaze changed, becoming exceptionally resolute. From beginning to end, his eyes remained fixed on the seven exposed gems. \"We’ve known each other for quite some time now. I haven’t introduced you to my *eating tools*§ yet. They are my closest friends.\"\n\nThe Fatty said with some curiosity, \"Indeed! I really haven’t heard you talk about them. These seven blades are stranger than the last. Do tell me about them.\"\n\nNian Bing’s eyes revealed a mesmerized glow. \"Sigh of the Ice Snow Goddess—Morning Dew.\" With a soft hum, blue light suddenly burst forth, and the ice elements on the mountaintop noticeably intensified.\n\n\"Roar of the Flame God—Sun Blade.\" Red light shone; this was a divine artifact representing fire.\n\n\"Whisper of the Free Wind—Sky-Defying Blade.\" Green light shone; this was a divine artifact representing wind.\n\n\"Melody of the Earth’s Awakening—Longevity Blade.\" Yellow light shone; this was a divine artifact representing earth.\n\n\"Ever-Changing Hexagram of Divine Mechanisms—Xuanji Blade.\" Silver light shone. This was a divine artifact representing space.\n\n\"Dawn that Penetrates Heaven and Earth—Holy Radiance Blade.\" White light shone; this was a divine artifact representing light.\n\n\"Curse of Eternal Hell—Demon-Devouring Blade.\" Black light shone; this was a divine artifact representing darkness.\n\nSeven-colored lights suddenly burst forth, interweaving into brilliant hues like a rainbow. Nian Bing** smiled, looking at the seven-colored lights, and said, \"They are the Seven Divine Blades, and also magic staffs that condense the seven elements: ice, fire, wind, earth, space, light, and darkness. Most importantly, they are all my kitchen knives.\"\n\nThe smile on the Fatty’s face suddenly vanished, replaced by a grave expression. He clearly felt that this time, Nian Bing’s aura was distinctly different from before. A faint golden light appeared on his body—it was precisely the pinnacle of battle aura: Divine Battle Aura. Leaning slightly forward, his fat, large body, enveloped in golden light, now resembled a solid heavy sword. Yes, he was indeed a Divine Master, holding the highest title for a martial artist. At the same time, Nian Bing also knew that this Fatty was a Sword Saint-class Divine Master. Just as Nian Bing had initially surmised, the Fatty’s strength could definitely be called that of a Demigod Body.\n\nNian Bing’s eyes blazed with light. He raised both hands, and his long, nimble fingers, guided by his forearms, swiftly drew two hexagrams in front of him—one red, one blue—looking strikingly vivid. \"Oh, Ice Snow Goddess! Grant me eternal frozen ice! Oh, Flame God! Grant me the Phoenix Nirvana Flame! In my name, the limits of ice and fire, merge!\" The seven gems on the seven blades simultaneously lit up. Red and blue lights intertwined, drawing the other five colors to suddenly surge towards his own body.\n\nThe seven-colored light enveloped Nian Bing’s body, using the previous red and blue hexagrams as a conduit, forming a strange full-element barrier. A peculiar smile appeared in the young man’s eyes as he said to the Fatty, \"Let me show you a special magic I’ve newly researched: All-Element: Shadow Puppets.\"\n\nThe magical light curved. From the brilliant seven-colored light around Nian Bing’s body, seven rays suddenly shot out—blue, red, green, yellow, silver, white, and black—each stopping before one of the seven magic blades. Nian Bing’s eyes shone brightly, and a strange circular symbol appeared on his glabella—it was a blurry, indistinct eye. In an instant, vast spiritual power drifted out, merging with the seven colored rays. The seven-colored lights began to change; the seven types of light almost simultaneously condensed into form, revealing seven humanoid figures. These were not illusory figures, but entirely composed of magical elements, identical to Nian Bing himself in height and appearance, though their bodies appeared unusually translucent due to being made of energy.\n\nThe seven-colored light figures simultaneously extended their hands, drawing out the seven precious blades that had been stuck in the ground. Instantly, blue, red, green, yellow, silver, white, and black lights flared brightly. The seven figures and the seven blades seemed to completely merge into one. The seven-colored light figures moved with a speed almost imperceptible to the naked eye. In just a flash, they had surrounded the Fatty.\n\nThe Fatty looked in surprise at the seven light figures surrounding him, whose auras were unusually bizarre. He asked in bewilderment, \"Nian Bing, what is this thing you’ve conjured, kid? Is it still magic?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Of course it’s magic. Haven’t you heard of Puppetry in Dark Magic? It allows one to control people who have lost their sanity as their puppets. Puppetry is simply too sinister, requiring living people as catalysts, so I really can’t bring myself to use it. However, after my research these past few days, by combining Puppetry with my Full-Element Mimicry Magic, I created this spell. Fatty, your defense is the strongest I’ve ever seen among people. If my guess is correct, your battle aura should be earth-attributed, and your so-called Magic Warrior practices earth-element magic as well. To break through your defense, it would only be possible if I could wield Forbidden Curse magic as conceived in my mind*. But there’s another way, and that is to rely on the sharpness of divine artifacts. No matter how strong your defense, can you really completely defend against these top-tier magic blades of mine, imbued with various magical auras? I really don’t believe it. Today, let these seven keep you company and play around. You’d better be careful.\"\n\nAll-Element: Shadow Puppets consumed countless hours of Nian Bing’s effort. If his Heavenly Eye Acupoint hadn’t opened, it would have been almost impossible for him to control this magic. But through continuous research and the growth of his innate aura, he actually succeeded. The seven puppets, formed from condensed energy, each were based on innate energy. Once formed, they didn’t require Nian Bing’s magical power for support; relying on the properties of innate energy, they could directly absorb magical elements from the air to sustain themselves. Their movements were entirely under Nian Bing’s spiritual power control.\n\nThe Heavenly Eye Acupoint brought Nian Bing two greatest benefits: one was the growth of his overall strength and the great opening of his spiritual apertures, and the other was a significant increase in his spiritual power. Through continuous cultivation, his spiritual power could easily control dozens of spells to launch different attacks simultaneously. Nian Bing was convinced that while his spiritual power level might not compare to Dragon Summoner Shirard, it wouldn’t be too far behind.\n\n---\n* A Chinese idiom meaning to nitpick or find fault where there is none.\n† Literally, \"beaten into the earth.\" This implies being beaten so thoroughly that one is knocked unconscious or buried, typically in a hole.\n‡ A humorous parody of a famous line of poetry: \"Life is precious, love is pricier; for freedom, both can be thrown away.\"\n§ A humorous double entendre, as Nian Bing is a chef and refers to his knives, implying they are essential for his cooking (eating).\n** The original text here uses \"金青年人\" (golden young man) but notes that the character has already been identified as Nian Bing, suggesting an inconsistency in the original writing.\n*** The phrase \"禁咒心目\" (jìnzhòu xīnmù) literally translates to \"Forbidden Curse of the mind/heart/mind's eye.\" It implies a very advanced, possibly purely mental, form of magic or a Forbidden Curse that exists only in his conceptual understanding, suggesting immense power that hasn't fully manifested.",

    "content": "Seven puppets, holding seven peerless divine blades, moved simultaneously. Seven completely different auras wove into a large net, rushing towards Fatty simultaneously. There was no dazzling brilliance, no grand momentum; the seven different treasured blades lunged forward at once, and the blade auras, over a foot long on each blade, instantly sealed off all paths around Fatty. The seven puppets, like brothers from the same mother, cooperated with unmatched tacit understanding.\n\nFatty had always prided himself on his strong defense, but facing the blade auras on the seven peerless divine blades, he dared not be careless in the slightest. Divine Battle Qi suddenly burst forth, his corpulent body twisted sharply to the side, and both hands swung simultaneously. With seven crisp 'ding, ding, ding...' sounds, the puppets were simultaneously forced back a zhang* away. However, the seven figures separated and immediately rejoined, the blade auras still present, attacking Fatty anew. The light on the blades was extremely compressed magical power, coupled with the sharpness of the blades themselves and the amplification from seven top-tier gemstones. Although their momentum was not grand, their attack power was absolutely terrifying.\n\nNian Bing was not relaxed at this moment; controlling the seven puppets remotely required complete concentration. After more than ten contests over the past three months, he had already gained a comprehensive understanding of Fatty's strength. If he were even slightly careless, Fatty might find an opportunity to destroy the Shadow Puppets. The strength of the seven puppets was equivalent to seven Martial Artists. The reason they could entangle and contend with Fatty, besides their perfect cooperation under Nian Bing's mental control, was also due to the interconnectedness of the seven magic elements and the function of the seven magical blades. It was only by combining these characteristics that Fatty could be made to feel apprehension.\n\nDeep marks continuously appeared on the rocks at the mountaintop. Fatty's body was exceptionally agile, coupled with his formidable Divine Battle Qi. Although the speed of the Shadow Puppets already made him somewhat overwhelmed, he could still barely maintain. The light in Fatty's eyes gradually changed, from initial surprise to growing solemnity. Originally, in his mind, for Nian Bing to contend with him, it would absolutely be impossible without ten or eight years. But he never expected Nian Bing had actually found such a method, relying on the unique properties of all-elemental magic, coupled with the cooperation of the seven divine blades, he was actually able to trap himself. Looking at the pulsating blade auras, Fatty was not without apprehension. Although he was full of confidence in himself, he dared not use his corpulent body to directly withstand the supreme divine blades.\n\nThe Shadow Puppets' attack method was very simple. It relied on speed. Although Divine Battle Qi was powerful, its effect on Shadow Puppets, which were entirely condensed from magic elements, was not good. The speed of the Shadow Puppets was entirely driven by magic elements; once they moved, there were only seven faint afterimages in the air. Even Nian Bing, who controlled them, needed to use his Heavenly Eye to clearly see the movements of the Shadow Puppets. No matter how strong Fatty was, at this moment he could only rely on his powerful perception to repeatedly use Battle Qi to forcibly repel the Shadow Puppets. For these Shadow Puppets that could automatically absorb external magic elements, his consumption was much greater. For a time, he was completely caught in a stalemate. Nian Bing naturally was not in a hurry; what he wanted to do was to greatly deplete Fatty's Battle Qi, and then seek an opportunity to achieve victory.\n\nThe seven-colored figures flashed ceaselessly and tirelessly, and the deep marks on the ground grew more numerous. Although Fatty's Divine Battle Qi was still powerful, the repeated consumption also made him somewhat unable to bear it. Finally, amidst the consumption, Fatty moved. Divine Battle Qi instantly erupted, suddenly forcing the seven Shadow Puppets back. The next moment, his massive body had lunged forward, arriving before Nian Bing, aiming a punch at Nian Bing's chest. To destroy the Shadow Puppets, the best way was to cut off their source. This was the first time he had taken the initiative to attack in a battle with Nian Bing. To be able to force Fatty to this point, Nian Bing had reason to be proud.\n\nA trace of mockery appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. Seeing Fatty arrive before him, he did not dodge. Suddenly, a circle of seven-colored radiance drifted out from his body. These were seven light orbs, condensed to the size of fists, each carrying surging magical energy. Centered around Nian Bing, the space within a radius of three zhang completely twisted. The dense magic elements seemed to lock everything down. Fatty's rapidly charging body instantly slowed down considerably. Amidst the flashing light, the seven Shadow Puppets simultaneously disappeared and reappeared, once again surrounding Fatty. However, this time it was different. Fatty's speed greatly decreased within the twisted seven-colored light, while the speed of the seven Shadow Puppets increased exponentially. The seven-colored lights flashed simultaneously. Although Fatty timely activated his Divine Battle Qi to force them back, he still had seven shallow marks on his body. Fatty was greatly alarmed in his heart; the energy emitted by Nian Bing himself was truly too strange. Under the full activation of his Divine Battle Qi, his enormous body shone with golden light like the sun. Daring not to delay in the slightest, he punched the ground heavily. The entire mountaintop instantly collapsed, and Fatty shot into the sky using the strong recoil force, only then barely escaping the twisted seven-colored energy. However, he had dozens more wounds on his body. Those were not simple wounds; the seven magical auras attached to the seven divine blades pierced into his body like needles. Under Nian Bing's control, the originally mutually generative seven energies immediately transformed into mutually destructive upon entering his body. The surging magical energy rapidly destroyed his bodily functions. If it weren't for his extremely powerful defense, filtering out most of the energy, his internal organs would probably have been torn to shreds by these seven completely different auras. Surrounded by the twisted seven-colored energy, Nian Bing's body floated in mid-air. Fatty had left the range of his energy; although the seven Shadow Puppets continuously attacked, they temporarily posed no threat to him. Fatty's body suddenly began to shine with seven-colored radiance. The first to appear was yellow light, followed by red, blue, green, silver, white, and black. Each time a light appeared, one type of magical power that had entered his body was forced out. After the seven types of light successively shone, the energy unleashed by the dozens of cuts he had previously sustained was no longer sufficient to pose a threat to him. Despite this, he still had quite a scare; the fat on his face trembled slightly. Yellow light condensed into a purely energy-based longsword, carrying golden Battle Qi. It was wielded into a mass of light, preventing the seven Shadow Puppets from approaching him again.\n\nNian Bing looked at Fatty in surprise. \"Impossible, how can you also use all-elemental magic?\" Originally, he thought Fatty would have been severely wounded by the previous attack, but from the current situation, although Fatty was injured, his injuries were far less severe than he had imagined. Especially when seven-colored light successively flashed from Fatty's body, he could clearly feel the magic elements being forced out.\n\nFatty angrily said while dealing with the seven Shadow Puppets: \"You crafty little rascal. Your Congenital Domain has actually awakened. I was completely taken in by you! Damn it, what kind of broken domain is that?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"This is the secret why I haven't advanced to Archmage all this time. The Congenital Domain absorbed a large amount of my innate aura and magical power. It only just awakened the day before yesterday. You're the first test subject, feels good, doesn't it? I gave this domain a name, it's called the Heavenly Eye Domain. Because it was formed with the help of the Heavenly Eye Point. And it can only be fully utilized under the effect of the Heavenly Eye Point. This domain of mine has no offensive capabilities, only two abilities: amplification and defense. However, losing offensive capability greatly enhanced its defensive and amplification effects. How is it? Feels good, right? Once the Shadow Puppets are within this domain of mine, they can unleash more than double their power. Even your Divine Battle Qi would probably have difficulty dealing with it.\"\n\n\"Good boy, you've indeed grown stronger. Come on, it's really not easy to defeat you without showing some real skill. Take my Heaven-Defying Slash, let's see if your domain and puppets can defend against it.\" Fatty's figure had disappeared. He himself was like a giant sun, golden light continuously intensifying. The Battle Qi sword in his hand was raised high above his head; the air seemed to have been completely drained. The impact of the seven Shadow Puppets' speed was actually naturally diverted. The abnormally immense pressure startled Nian Bing, who was floating in the air; he subconsciously drifted backward. The seven Shadow Puppets also flew over, following him, merging into his Heavenly Eye Domain. Only then could the seven Shadow Puppets exert their strongest effect. These seven Shadow Puppets could originally not have been formed with Nian Bing's own abilities. However, after several months of continuous effort, and after opening his Spirit Aperture**, he finally found a way to use the seven magical blades. The gemstones embedded in the seven magical blades were the core of these seven Shadow Puppets, enabling them to unleash such powerful abilities, even trapping a God Descendant Master-level Fatty. Now, Fatty was clearly enraged. Nian Bing's strength had, after all, only recently increased; facing Fatty, he had no confidence at all.\n\nThe intense light suddenly disappeared. Fatty seemed to be holding a materialized longsword in his hand; his expression was very calm. He lightly waved his right hand, and a light invisible to the naked eye drifted out, heading straight for Nian Bing's domain. Nian Bing's expression changed slightly. He could naturally sense that it was an extremely condensed, massive energy. He pulled his hands together in front of him, his Heavenly Eye Point fully opened, and light instantly burst forth from between his eyebrows. \"Seven Blades United, Heavenly Eye Slash.\" The seven Shadow Puppets instantly lined up, the seven magical blades simultaneously raised high. The foremost was the Roar of the Fire God Zhengyang Blade, followed by the Morning Dew Blade, Proud Heaven Blade, Longevity Blade, Xuanji Blade, Holy Radiance Blade, and Demon Devouring Blade. Seven different lights condensed at a single point. The seven Shadow Puppets performed the same action. The Heavenly Eye Slash did not cleave out a blade of light, but rather a condensed seven-colored light sphere. The light of the sphere was extremely peculiar; it was definitely not a patchwork of seven colors, but rather continuously flickered, changing to another color with each flicker. Only a fist-sized light sphere drifted out. Under the discernment of the Heavenly Eye Point, it accurately locked onto Fatty's Heaven-Defying Slash. As the light emerged, the light sphere drifted forward to meet it. After the light sphere appeared, the seven Shadow Puppets simultaneously disappeared, and the seven divine blades floated around Nian Bing's body. That tiny light sphere had actually drained all the energy from the seven Shadow Puppets.\n\nThe next scene left Nian Bing dumbfounded. There was no explosion as imagined, nor any dazzling brilliance. When the Heaven-Defying Slash and the Heavenly Eye Slash met, the light sphere formed by the Heavenly Eye Slash rapidly flashed through seven colors of light. Immediately after, with a soft 'poof', both attacks completely disappeared. Only a soft sound, yet it took away immense energy from both Nian Bing and Fatty.\n\nFatty's clothes had already turned into rags earlier. Staring dumbfounded at the spot where the two energies had collided earlier, he let out a strange cry. \"Holy sh*t, no way, did *fú jí tài lái*** actually happen?\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned, and said, \"Fatty, what is *fú jí tài lái*?\"\n\nFatty smiled bitterly and said, \"It's simple enough. That broken orb you sent out had the exact same attack power as my Heaven-Defying Slash. Under an indescribably miraculous circumstance, the two energies completely nullified each other. Because the explosive power reached a certain level, and the two energies were exactly the same, this *fú jí tài lái* situation occurs. You can understand it as them completely canceling each other out. Don't ask me where all that explosive energy went, I can't explain it clearly either. Although I've heard of the *fú jí tài lái* phenomenon before, this is the first time I've truly seen it. Boy, you're something! The power of your strike has already reached that of a Forbidden Spell, and it's a single-target Forbidden Spell at that. It seems, trying to deal with you again won't be an easy task. I just don't understand why you suddenly became so powerful? A mere Congenital Domain couldn't possibly have made you what you are now, right? Even an Archmage, facing the amplification and defensive capabilities of your strange Congenital Domain, would probably have no way to deal with you.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes filled with emotion. He smiled faintly, looking at the seven magical blades floating around his body. \"Of course, while the Congenital Domain is powerful, it couldn't possibly elevate me to this level. That last strike was not solely my strength, but also the power of these seven magical blades of mine. It's thanks to the effect of the seven top-tier divine stones that I can barely contend with you. Fatty, I know you've always held back. Even now, you're far from using your full strength, but in the future, if you want to beat me up that badly again, it probably won't be easy.\"\n\nFatty nodded and said, \"Indeed, you've reached your current realm. I could easily kill you, but defeating you isn't easy. Actually, I wouldn't call it holding back. If I wanted to defeat you, I'd have to use my true power, and at that point, the attack energy would be beyond my control, and could only destroy you. But I'm still counting on you to cook for me, how could I bear to kill you? Although I predicted this day would come, I didn't expect it to arrive so quickly. Your Heavenly Eye Point combined with those seven broken blades of yours actually forcibly elevated you to this level.\"\n\nNian Bing dispersed his Congenital Domain, retrieved the seven magical blades, and floating in mid-air, respectfully bowed to Fatty. \"Senior***, for the past three months, although you've often hit me, and forced me to cook for you, and even captured my beloved Feng Nü, however, you have also given me many things. Without your guidance and motivation, the Nian Bing of today would not exist. Since you can no longer defeat me without killing me, shouldn't our ten-day battles be canceled? Please return Feng Nü to me. Nian Bing will forever remember your kindness.\"\n\n---\n*   **Zhang (丈)**: A traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.3 meters or 10 feet.\n**   **Spirit Aperture (靈竅)**: A concept in cultivation novels, usually referring to specific energy points or channels within the body that can be opened or awakened to enhance one's power or perception.\n*** **Fú jí tài lái (否極泰來)**: A Chinese idiom.

    "content": "Fatty's face showed a hint of a smile. A yellow light flashed all over his body, and his tattered clothes had disappeared, replaced by new ones, entirely formed from energy. \"Kid, you're smart, but I can't let your wife out yet. Although your seven-element magic has achieved minor success, it's still far from enough for adventuring on the continent. Quick, hand over all your blades to me. Our battle will only truly end when you can reach your previous state without relying on these seven blades. No matter how good a weapon is, it's not as reliable as yourself. Do you understand what I mean?\"\n\nNianbing was stunned for a moment. Looking at the smile in Fatty's eyes, a sense of familiarity suddenly arose in his heart. He took out the seven divine blades from his Space Ring. \"Senior, I'm very willing to continue with you, as it benefits me greatly. However, could you let me see Feng Nü first, as a reward for my efforts these past few days?\" Although he had always known Fatty held no ill will, as the saying goes, concern clouded his judgment*, and his longing for Feng Nü compelled him to say these things.\n\nFatty nodded, just about to agree to Nianbing. Suddenly, his expression changed drastically, and the fat on his large, fleshy face trembled. \"How is this possible? Damn it, it's a distress signal. Kid, it seems our business will have to be put on hold for now. You at least have self-preservation abilities now, so just come with me. Put away those precious blades of yours; they'll be life-saving items when the time comes. Don't ask anything, just follow me.\" As he spoke, his body, enveloped in yellow light, rapidly flew in one direction. Nianbing didn't know what had happened to Fatty, but Feng Nü was still in his hands, so Nianbing could only follow him at the fastest possible speed.\n\nFatty flew very fast. The speed of Battle Qi flight was beyond the reach of any magic, especially at Fatty's level. Battle Qi consumption was nothing to him. After flying for a while, Fatty became a yellow dot in Nianbing's eyes. Just as he felt anxious, Fatty suddenly stopped. When Nianbing approached, he casually waved out a yellow rope. It wrapped around Nianbing's waist, and he urgently said, \"Relax your body, use wind magic to lighten your weight. I'll take you. We must get there as quickly as possible.\"\n\nAfter knowing Fatty for so long, this was the first time Nianbing had seen such an anxious expression on him. But since Fatty told him not to ask, he said nothing more. Under the influence of Battle Qi, Fatty carried Nianbing and flew rapidly upwards. Heading north, Fatty's speed was now fully unleashed. Nianbing truly experienced the might of a Divine Master. Everything around them became illusory. The extreme speed was like a meteor streaking across the sky*. The fierce winds at high altitude made it impossible for Nianbing to breathe, so he simply held his breath and switched to internal breathing, relying on his body to absorb the Innate Spiritual Energy and various magical elements from heaven and earth to replenish himself.\n\nThis flight lasted two days and two nights. Midway, Fatty only stopped once to let Nianbing eat something, while he himself merely meditated to recover his Battle Qi. As soon as Nianbing finished eating, they immediately resumed their flight, still heading north. Nianbing's heart was full of questions: Fatty's strength was already so immense, what on the continent could make him so anxious? At first, he thought of many possibilities, but later, he simply stopped thinking about it. He cultivated while pondering how to perfect his seven-element magic. The emergence of the Innate Domain greatly enhanced Nianbing's strength, but it also consumed a lot of his magical power. Now, when he cultivated again, it was truly a process of improving his strength. Nianbing understood that he was only a hair's breadth away* from becoming an Archmage. His spiritual power was already sufficient; as long as his magical power increased to the level where he could cast tenth-tier spells, he would then become a true Archmage, a full Archmage. At that time, as long as he continued to work hard, it wouldn't take long for him to qualify to challenge the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. \"Father, Mother, are you truly not dead? If so, wait for me. Nianbing will rescue you as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThinking of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, Nianbing immediately recalled the acupoints Fatty had mentioned. Over the past three months, he had gained much knowledge from Fatty. According to Fatty, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had only opened two acupoints. The human body was a miraculous domain. The \"gods\" living on another Divine Continent were, in fact, all human. However, humans of that era were much stronger than ordinary humans due to the harsh environment, and some of them had even opened more than two acupoints, possessing formidable abilities incomparable to ordinary people. If he could also open two acupoints, then the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess would no longer be frightening. However, according to Fatty, opening any acupoint was extraordinary; it couldn't be achieved solely through effort. Opportunity was equally important. Although human acupoints had fixed locations, opening them not only required vast amounts of energy but also had to align with factors like heavenly timing and earthly advantage to succeed. The seven human acupoints were: Celestial Eye Acupoint, Earth Spirit Acupoint, Cloud Listening Acupoint, Lì Zhong Acupoint, West Meridian Acupoint, Square Armor Acupoint, and Emperor's Apex Acupoint. Among them, the Celestial Eye Acupoint and Emperor's Apex Acupoint were the hardest to open. One represented wisdom, and the other represented aura and strength. None of the seven acupoints were relatively easy to open. The locations of the seven acupoints were: Celestial Eye Acupoint at the center of the eyebrows, Earth Spirit Acupoint at the sole of the foot, Cloud Listening Acupoint an inch below the back of the ear, Lì Zhong Acupoint half an inch below the thoracic spine, West Meridian Acupoint three inches below the navel in the lower abdomen, Square Armor Acupoint one inch and two *fen* above the center of the back, and the Emperor's Apex Acupoint could exist anywhere in the human body. Once the Emperor's Apex Acupoint was opened, the part of the body where it was located would become the strongest point. The Emperor's Apex Acupoint was not a single acupoint; multiple could be opened. According to Fatty, there were people on the Divine Continent who had opened three Emperor's Apex Acupoints. Such individuals could possess three strongest points, and with the combined area covered by these three points, it would indeed not be an exaggeration to call them gods. Naturally, what Nianbing wanted to open most was the Emperor's Apex Acupoint, but he also knew that it was too difficult for him. Heaven knew how many years those old monsters on the Divine Continent had cultivated.\n\nAfter two days and two nights of continuous flight, even a powerful individual like Fatty showed a hint of fatigue on his face, but his speed didn't slow down in the slightest. On the contrary, Nianbing's cultivation was not affected by flying in the air. In two days, he not only recovered the energy consumed by casting Shadow Puppet but also improved his magical power. After gaining the Celestial Eye Acupoint, his speed of absorbing magical power was several times faster than before. Cultivating naturally became much easier, and every day of cultivation brought a completely new feeling. Now, for Nianbing, becoming powerful was only a matter of time.\n\nIn the distance, a massive mountain range appeared before Nianbing's eyes. Even though they were flying very fast, the mountain range's vastness made it clearly visible. Fatty, who had been flying north, suddenly slowed down. His body twisted in the air and darted downwards. Nianbing's heart stirred. Had they reached their destination? Just then, Fatty's voice clearly entered Nianbing's ears, \"We are not there yet. You must remain vigilant at all times. At certain moments, I may not be able to save you. This mountain range is located at the border between the Langmu Empire and the Bingyue Empire. It's called Cold Ridge, and it's perpetually frigid.\"\n\nNianbing was startled by Fatty's words. Although he had highly estimated their flying speed, he hadn't expected that in just two days, he and Fatty had traversed the northern part of the Huarong Empire and the entire Langmu Empire.\n\nFaint clouds and mist constantly drifted above Cold Ridge. Chilling currents assaulted them, and the ice elements in the air clearly grew stronger. The waves of cold made Nianbing shiver involuntarily. He quickly took out the Zhengyang Blade from his Space Ring and relied on its emitted warmth to dispel the chill. He opened his mouth and exhaled a breath of hot air; the moisture in his breath condensed into ice shards that drifted down, astonishing Nianbing. \"It's so cold!\" he thought. No wonder his own magical power couldn't withstand such cold currents. In such a frigid place, who was Fatty bringing him to find?\n\nBefore Nianbing could think further, Fatty had already brought him close to Cold Ridge. Fatty seemed very familiar with the situation here. He flew skillfully* above the mountain range, seemingly searching for something as he flew. Suddenly, Fatty's eyes lit up. \"It's been so long, I almost forgot the place. I hope they're alright.\" Just then, a mass of blue light rapidly approached from a distance. Fatty's heart stirred, and he stopped himself mid-air. Nianbing, who was being carried, suddenly shot forward and only stopped his momentum by forcefully colliding with Fatty. Fortunately, Fatty's body was thick enough that he wasn't injured.\n\n\"Why did you stop so suddenly? Are you trying to make me crash to my death!\" Nianbing complained. At this moment, he also noticed the rapidly approaching blue light. Remembering Fatty's words, his heart instantly tightened.\n\nThe blue light arrived in front of them in the blink of an eye. A cold, clear voice rang out, \"Dead Fatty, what are you doing here? Did you send the distress signal?\"\n\nFatty laughed loudly and said, \"Sarariss, so many years have passed, and you still have that gloomy look*. I also received the distress signal and rushed here as fast as I could. I estimate something has happened to Boss and the others.\"\n\nNianbing poked his head out from behind Fatty and looked at the blue figure. At this moment, his heart was filled with doubt. Fatty knew this \"Sarariss,\" and they seemed to be friends. Did a master like Fatty even have a boss? And his boss needed rescuing? \"Heavens! What kind of world is this, with so many powerhouses suddenly appearing?\" The one who appeared was a woman. A blue long dress enveloped her alluring figure. Her slender build was surprisingly similar in height to Nianbing. A head of silver-white hair danced in the cold wind. Her clothes looked thin, but she showed no sign of being cold. Her eyes, similar to his own in their blue hue, were filled with intense coldness. Seeing this person, Nianbing couldn't help but think of the Ice God Tower. His heart sank, and he asked aloud, \"Someone from the Ice God Tower?\"\n\nSarariss's gaze shifted, and she also saw Nianbing. \"What's the Ice God Tower? Dead Fatty, you actually brought a human here?\"\n\nNianbing retorted, \"What do you mean 'a human'? Aren't you human?\"\n\nSarariss snorted disdainfully, said nothing more, and suddenly turned her body, rushing towards a valley ahead.\n\nFatty gave Nianbing a helpless glare and said, \"Just speak less, alright? If you anger my Sarariss again next time, I'm not done with you.\"\n\nNianbing looked at him in surprise and said, \"Your Sarariss? Is she your wife?\"\n\nFatty said somewhat awkwardly, \"Not yet, but I'll work hard. I believe she will be soon.\"\n\n\"Fatty, you're fantasizing again*. Aren't you afraid Sarariss will hear and freeze your fat?\" A mass of green light, like a meteor, arrived before Nianbing and Fatty in a blink. It was a tall, middle-aged man. Dressed in green, he had an air of detachment. Seeing this person, Nianbing's heart stirred. It was a sense of déjà vu, but upon careful recollection, he found no impression of this person in his memory.\n\nFatty said with slight anger, \"Damn it, Karoriss, can't you give me some encouragement? Even if Little Bing doesn't like me now, it doesn't mean she won't like me later.\"\n\nKaroriss laughed loudly and said, \"Alright, you lazy Fatty, hurry up. Have you forgotten about the distress signal?\"\n\nUpon hearing the five characters \"Karoriss,\" Nianbing's heart stirred, and he immediately realized he had definitely heard this name before, and it had left a deep impression. As he was recalling, Fatty and Karoriss simultaneously turned around, following the direction Sarariss had disappeared, and headed into the valley.\n\nAs soon as they passed the ice peak nearby, Nianbing immediately felt a spring-like warmth wash over him. His entire body felt indescribably warm and comfortable. A vast expanse of green appeared before his eyes. This was actually a warm valley, a good place he had never expected to find in the frigid Cold Ridge, with its extremely low temperatures.\n\nFatty and Karoriss drifted down. On the ground, there were three other people looking towards them. One was a tall man in silver robes, bearing a seven-tenths resemblance to Karoriss. The other woman in blue was naturally Sarariss. The last person made Nianbing's eyes widen in disbelief: it was Huojialamandiiss, whom he hadn't seen in many days!\n\nIn an instant, various thoughts surged through Nianbing's mind. He spun around abruptly, grabbing Fatty by the collar, and demanded, \"Dead Fatty, you're also a dragon, aren't you? You're the Earth Dragon King!\" All the doubts about Fatty were completely resolved at this moment: why he possessed such formidable power, why he was skilled in both magic and martial arts, why his defensive capabilities were so strong, why he emitted light of seven-element magic when breaking his Shadow Puppet, and why he knew Nianbing was a chef. Everything was explained by his identity as the Earth Dragon King. Understanding everything in an instant, Nianbing felt a certain degree of relief. At least now, he was sure that Fatty was not his enemy.\n\n---\n*   **Concern clouded his judgment**: A literal translation of \"關心則亂\" (guān xīn zé luàn) is \"concern leads to chaos/confusion.\"\n*   **Like a meteor streaking across the sky**: A more natural English rendering of \"流星趕月\" (liú xīng gǎn yuè), which literally means \"like a meteor chasing the moon.\"\n*   **Only a hair's breadth away**: A common English idiom for \"一線之差\" (yī xiàn zhī chā), which literally means \"a difference of a single line.\"\n*   **Flew skillfully**: A natural English rendering of \"輕車熟路\" (qīng chē shú lù), which literally means \"light carriage, familiar road,\" implying knowing one's way around.\n*   **Gloomy look**: A natural English rendering of \"一臉死人樣\" (yī liǎn sǐ rén yàng), which literally means \"a dead person's look.\"\n*   **Fantasizing again**: A natural English rendering of \"做春夢\" (zuò chūn mèng), which literally means \"dreaming a spring dream,\" referring to daydreaming about romance or sex.",

    "content": "The fat man swatted Nian Bing's hand away and chuckled, saying, \"Kid, you're pretty quick on the uptake. Galamandis, you're the one who let the cat out of the bag, aren't you?\"\n\nGalamandis grumbled unhappily, \"You damn fat man, you must have eaten a lot of good things from Nian Bing, and now you blame me. But why did you bring Nian Bing here? He's just a human; he probably can't handle what we're about to face.\"\n\nWhen Nian Bing saw Galamandis, a sense of indescribable closeness rose in his heart. \"You stinky fire dragon, you're the one who told the fat man to deal with me, aren't you? Hurry up and tell him to release Feng Nü.\"\n\nGalamandis walked over to Nian Bing, affectionately put his arm around his shoulder, and smiled slightly, saying, \"Come, let me introduce you first. This is the beautiful lady among our Seven Dragon Kings, Ice Dragon King Sarris.\" Saying that, he pointed to the tall, beautiful woman in blue. Sarris looked at Nian Bing, her brows furrowed slightly, and said, \"Galamandis, you and the fat man seem very familiar with this human?\"\n\nNian Bing now understood that Sarris was indeed not human. No wonder she had spoken that way earlier.\n\nGalamandis chuckled, saying, \"Of course, very familiar. If you've eaten his cooking, you'd also quickly become familiar with him.\"\n\n\"Oh, so he's a chef?\" The silver-robed person beside them approached with some surprise.\n\nGalamandis nodded, saying, \"And he's also a magician. Nian Bing, this guy is the most useless one among us, Spatial Dragon King Ka'oudilis. Aside from being good at escaping, his other abilities are quite mediocre. You don't need to pay attention to him.\"\n\n\"So it's you.\" Karodilis also walked over. \"I don't need to introduce myself, do I? You probably already know who I am.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, saying, \"It really is you. We met last time. You are the guardian divine dragon of the white people, Wind Dragon King Karodilis.\"\n\nKa'oudilis interrupted, saying, \"And, he's also my dear younger brother.\"\n\nKarodilis's brows furrowed slightly. Galamandis said, \"How do you two look like brothers? If your temper were half as good as Karodilis', you wouldn't be like this now.\"\n\nFinally, Galamandis turned his gaze to the fat man. \"This fat man must have eaten a lot of good things from you. You must remember, he is the laziest, most gluttonous, and fattest among our seven, the Earth Dragon King Papparukass. If you want revenge, remember his name. Use *your own strength* though. I'd really love to see you squeeze a few *jin* of oil out of him.\"¹\n\n\"Pa-pa? Hmph, I don't see anything scary about him,\" Nian Bing said grumpily.\n\nThe veins on the fat man's forehead pulsed. \"Bah, not *that* 'pa' (scared), it's the 'pa' from *shoupa* (handkerchief).\"²\n\n\"I don't care what 'pa' you mean, just release my Feng Nü first. Galamandis. I need an explanation from you.\"\n\nThe fat man mumbled, \"It seems getting another seven-element feast will be difficult. Fine, I'll release her.\" With a wave of his hand, a red figure appeared before Nian Bing. It was none other than Feng Nü, whom he hadn't seen in months.\n\nUpon seeing Feng Nü, Spatial Dragon King Ka'oudilis's eyes immediately shone with a peach-heart-like glow,³ and Karodilis and Sarris both revealed surprised gazes. Clearly, it was due to Feng Nü's radiant beauty.\n\nFeng Nü looked no different, except her pretty face was filled with joy. She abruptly threw herself into Nian Bing's embrace. \"Nian Bing.\" Tears streamed down her face. For the past few months, she had been in the fat man's spatial bag. Although she could see everything outside, the loneliness within the spatial bag and Nian Bing's constant efforts had long stirred her emotions. Finally able to escape, how could she control the emotions in her heart? She no longer cared that there were many people present.\n\nWhen Nian Bing saw Feng Nü cry upon seeing him, he immediately misunderstood, thinking the fat man had made her suffer, and immediately glared at the fat man.\n\nThe fat man was momentarily stunned and said, \"What are you looking at me for? I didn't do anything. If you don't believe me, ask your wife yourself.\"\n\nOnly then did Feng Nü remember there were others around. She hastily pulled away from Nian Bing's embrace, wiping the tears from her face, and nodded gently to Nian Bing, saying, \"Although this fat man captured me then, he also gave me a lot of guidance in martial arts. Nian Bing, you've worked hard these past days, you've gotten thinner.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly, \"Of course I'd get thinner. Every ten days I'd get a beating and be forced to cook for this fat man. The rest of the time was mostly spent cultivating, striving to rescue you soon.\"\n\nThe fat man chuckled, \"You can't blame me for this. Galamandis made me do it. It has nothing to do with me. If you want revenge, go find him.\"\n\nGalamandis looked at the fat man with a half-smile and said, \"I told you to find Nian Bing and figure out a way to help him, but I didn't tell you to eat his cooking! Your intentions are impure.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Galamandis doubtfully. Although he had already guessed the general idea, he couldn't help but ask, \"Galamandis, what exactly is going on?\"\n\nGalamandis smiled slightly, saying, \"It's simple. Something happened on our Seven Dragon Kings' side. We were originally gathering everyone to discuss countermeasures, but this fat man was too lazy to wake up and attend the meeting. There was no other way, so I had to make a trip to his old nest in the Far North Ice Cave and drag him out. Later, as we were rushing here, we passed by Ice and Snow City and ate a meal at a place called Clear Wind Studio there. The fat man praised the food there endlessly, which reminded me of you, so I introduced your cooking abilities to him. As a result, when the fat man heard our relationship was good, he volunteered to come find you, preparing to help you raise your strength. You should be clear about what happened next. However, I never told him what to do; whatever he did to you was his own business. Hehe. Fat man, I really don't understand what's so scary about Nian Bing that you'd push the blame onto me.\"\n\nThe fat man said grumpily, \"Why don't you try him yourself and see what abilities he has? In terms of ability, among our seven, I, the fat man, might not be the strongest, but I can at least be considered average. But in terms of defense, even Boss Kaqiaoxisis might not be able to compare to me. After all, I am the Earth Dragon King, and defense is my specialty. Nian Bing, this kid, was able to break my defense and injure my true form, so tell me, what should I be afraid of? If you've got the guts, try fighting him without using powers above a Forbidden Spell. If you don't suffer a loss, then I'm talking nonsense. This is also why I brought him here this time, because I think he should be able to help us.\"\n\nGalamandis looked at Nian Bing in surprise. He naturally knew very well what Nian Bing's strength was like. He absolutely hadn't expected Nian Bing to have progressed so much after not seeing him for merely half a year, even the Earth Dragon King Papparukass praised him highly.\n\nUpon hearing the fat man's words, the anger on Nian Bing's face gradually disappeared. He took Feng Nü's hand and said, \"Fat man, although you've tortured me quite a bit these past few days and eaten a lot of my dishes, overall, though, you never truly made things difficult for me. Without your help, my magic couldn't have grown this quickly. Now that everything's clear, we're even. I don't hate you, nor will I feel indebted to you.\"\n\nThe fat man rubbed his two large, chubby hands together, muttering, \"You stinky kid, don't be so heartless. But now I don't have much interest in other food. You see...\"\n\nA hint of a smile appeared at the corner of Nian Bing's mouth. \"You are neither my enemy nor my benefactor. However, you can be my friend. I've always liked making food for my friends and inviting them to taste it.\"\n\nThe fat man was immediately overjoyed. \"Good, good, I'll be your friend then. You stinky kid, it's a good thing I didn't help you for nothing. Did you think those beatings every ten days were really me exercising my body by hitting you? You kid, you really don't know how good you have it.⁴ Others ask me to hit them and I wouldn't even agree. I was using Divine Combat Qi to alter the various functions within your body, strengthening your body as a whole. I, the fat man, didn't eat your cooking for nothing. Don't blame me for taking your wife either. If I didn't hold her, how could you cultivate steadily? Moreover, although your wife's progress during this time isn't as fast as yours, her improvement isn't slow either. A very talented young lady.\"\n\nWind Dragon King Karodilis said in surprise, \"Fat man, you're actually so generous? Consuming Divine Combat Qi like that is enough to put a burden on yourself.\"\n\nThe fat man smiled with a simple honesty, saying, \"Who told this kid to make such delicious food? Originally, I didn't intend to do that, but then I thought, having eaten so many of his delicacies, if I didn't contribute something, Galamandis, that guy, would definitely nag me. I couldn't think of any other way, so this was the only option.\"\n\nNian Bing had recently felt changes in his body but hadn't expected it to be the effect of the fat man's beatings. He smiled slightly, saying, \"Fat man, I won't thank you.\"\n\nThe fat man chuckled, \"You don't need to thank me. Just remember to make me more delicious food.\"\n\nSarris, who was standing by, suddenly spoke up. Her cold voice immediately shattered the harmonious atmosphere. \"Stop talking nonsense. Galamandis, what's the situation here? Why did you suddenly send out a distress signal?\"\n\nUpon hearing Sarris's question, Galamandis's previously smiling face immediately darkened. \"The situation is very serious. Otherwise, I wouldn't have sent out a distress signal. Dimenteti is about to give birth. And the enemies suddenly appeared the day before yesterday. The enemies are much stronger than we imagined. Judging by their auras, they are very likely the group that stole Mo'oudasi's Seal Bottle. The day before yesterday, before I sent the signal, it took the combined strength of our four Dragon Kings to barely drive the enemies away. But Dimenteti was affected and might go into premature labor, likely within the next day or two. As you know, we dragons are at our weakest when giving birth. Furthermore, after giving birth, the child needs several days of incubation to complete. During this process, not only will Dimenteti have no offensive power, but Kaqiaoxisis must also fully protect her and won't be able to fight. And the enemies are so powerful, I could only ensure their safety by summoning all of you with a distress signal.\"\n\nKarodilis frowned, saying, \"That's impossible! We are almost invincible on this continent. How could enemies appear that require the combined strength of four Dragon Kings to fight against?\"\n\nGalamandis said gravely, \"There's nothing impossible in this world. I'll just say one thing, and you'll understand why the enemies are terrifying when you think about it yourselves. Among the enemy's leaders, there is not only a Nether Witch who fears no physical attacks but also a Lich, a dominion-level master from the dark world. Just these two guys alone have given us a lot of trouble.\"\n\nUpon hearing the words 'Nether Witch' and 'Lich,' all five Dragon Kings present fell silent. Having lived for tens of thousands of years, they all understood what these two titles represented. Sarris no longer made a sound, the fat man frowned, while Ka'oudilis wore a bitter smile. It was Wind Dragon King Karodilis who finally spoke. \"No matter what, with all seven of us Dragon Kings gathered, even if the enemies are strong, we should be able to handle them. Let's go, let's go inside and check on Kaqiao and Dimenteti.\" Saying that, he led the way towards a wide cave not far ahead. The other Dragon Kings followed closely.\n\nNian Bing gave Feng Nü a look, stepped forward quickly, grabbing Galamandis who was walking last, and whispered, \"Let's talk in private. I have something to ask you.\"\n\nGalamandis was startled for a moment, then nodded, saying, \"Alright, let's go over there to talk.\"\n\nNian Bing turned back and smiled gently at Feng Nü, saying, \"Wait for me here for a moment, I'll be right back.\" After saying that, he walked with Galamandis towards a nearby bush.\n\nNian Bing walked until he estimated Feng Nü wouldn't be able to hear them, then stopped. Galamandis smiled slightly, saying, \"Don't worry, the fat man bringing you here was a mistake in itself. I won't let you take risks. Later, I'll say hello to the fat man and then send you both away from Cold Ridge.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned, saying with slight anger, \"What kind of person do you take me for? Do you think I'm that afraid of death? From when we first met until now, you've long ceased to be an enemy in my heart. How can a friend not help when others are in trouble? Although my strength is meager, and nothing compared to your Seven Dragon Kings, I'm still willing to do my part with this meager strength.\"\n\nGalamandis looked at Nian Bing with some surprise. \"Kid, you've changed a lot!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, looking at him and saying, \"You've changed a lot too. At least in front of your own kind, you no longer call yourself 'the great Galamandis'. Moreover, you don't seem as frivolous as I remembered; when faced with a situation, you really do have a composed side.\"\n\nGalamandis, exasperated, said, \"I just praised you a few words and you immediately start putting me down. Alright, tell me, why did you pull me aside behind your wife's back?\"\n\nNian Bing pondered for a moment before saying, \"Galamandis, tell me the truth, who exactly are the enemies you're facing this time? How powerful are they? Is their goal to seize the remaining Mo'oudasi's Seal Bottles?\"\n---\n¹ **_Jin_**: A traditional Chinese unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kilograms or 1.1 pounds.

    "content": "Galamandis nodded and said, \"That's right. Their goal is the remaining bottles. We still have four bottles in our possession, and we absolutely cannot let them get them. Our enemies this time are very powerful. One could say that even the combined dark forces of this entire continent are not as formidable as them. Do you know what a Lich is? They're fellows who require extremely good luck, an extreme obsession with darkness, and thousands of years to cultivate successfully.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly and said, \"I've heard of Liches. I've even seen a Nether Lich...\" Seeing Galamandis's surprised gaze, he recounted his encounter with Hilard that day.\n\nAfter hearing Nianbing's words, Galamandis said, \"So you've had such experiences. No wonder you've grown so fast. That blade of yours is indeed very effective against those in the dark world. It's a pity it's in your hands. If Dimantti held the Holy Radiance Blade, empowered by holy energy, even a Lich wouldn't be a threat to him. What a pity, what a pity. Nianbing, do you know? Our biggest problem this time is not having a master who can fully contend with a Lich. The Lich's power has exceeded our estimates, and without the support of Dimantti, the Light Dragon King, the battle will certainly be very difficult. It's not too late if you decide to leave now.\"\n\nNianbing smiled calmly and said, \"I am not one to go back on my word. Since I said I would stay, I will definitely stay. However, I must have Feng Nü leave. The other reason I sought you out was to ask you to escort her out of Frigid Ridge.\"\n\nGalamandis said, \"You've just reunited after a long separation. Will she be willing to leave you?\"\n\nNianbing smiled slightly, \"I have my own way for that. All right, I pretty much understand the situation. Let's go back.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Galamandis called out to Nianbing, a somewhat sheepish expression on his face. \"Nianbing, after we get through this, I have something I'd like to ask your advice on.\"\n\nNianbing was startled. He said, \"What's wrong with you? What is it?\"\n\nGalamandis's old face reddened. He said, \"Let's talk about it after we overcome this immediate challenge. All right, let's go back.\"\n\nNianbing nodded and said, \"You go into the cave first and greet the other Dragon Kings. After I've spoken with Feng Nü, you can escort her out of Frigid Ridge. Is that alright?\"\n\nGalamandis nodded. \"That's a small matter. Besides, the Phoenix Clan has some ties with our Dragon Clan, so escorting her out is naturally no problem, as long as you can persuade her.\"\n\nThe two returned to the cave entrance. Galamandis went directly into the cave, while Feng Nü looked at Nianbing with concern.\n\nNianbing took Feng Nü's hand and softly said, \"Aren't you going to ask what Galamandis and I talked about?\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled and shook her head, \"That's a matter between you men. Everyone should have a bit of privacy.\"\n\nNianbing's heart warmed. He embraced Feng Nü's supple waist. Even though Nianbing and Feng Nü hadn't met for the past few months, they both shared a feeling of having gone through hardships together. Feng Nü didn't pull away from Nianbing's hand. Instead, she actively leaned against his shoulder and hugged him back.\n\nNianbing hesitated for a moment before saying, \"Feng Nü, I've always had something I wanted to tell you.\"\n\n\"Mmm, tell me,\" Feng Nü slowly closed her eyes, her face full of warmth.\n\nNianbing gritted his teeth and said, \"What I'm about to tell you might be related to your origins.\"\n\nFeng Nü suddenly opened her beautiful eyes and looked at Nianbing in surprise, saying, \"My origins? I was born in the Phoenix Clan. The Phoenix Clan is my home. How do you know anything about my origins?\"\n\nNianbing sighed lightly and said, \"That's right, the Phoenix Clan is your home, but do you know who your parents are?\"\n\nThe color instantly drained from Feng Nü's delicate face, and she blurted out, \"Could it be, could it be that you know?\"\n\nNianbing gripped her slightly cold small hand and said, \"Don't get agitated. Let me finish. I'm only guessing. I don't have absolute certainty, and it still needs to be verified.\"\n\nFeng Nü's breathing became somewhat rapid, \"How do we verify it?\"\n\nNianbing said four words in a deep voice, \"Blood kinship test.\" Seeing Feng Nü look a bit stunned, his spatial ring flashed with silver light, and the small bottle he had brought out from Duke Yayou's Estate appeared in his hand. With a mutton-fat jade bottle as the vessel, fresh blood would not spoil.\n\nFeng Nü's breathing grew even more rapid. She looked at Nianbing with doubt, \"Whose, whose blood is this?\"\n\nNianbing didn't answer. He took a bowl from his spatial ring, condensed a piece of ice within it, then used fire magic to melt the ice into water. Opening the jade bottle, he dripped in a drop of blood and said, \"Don't ask whose blood it is for now. Please drip a drop of your own blood in as well. If the blood can merge, I will naturally tell you everything.\" If his guess was true, he would naturally tell Feng Nü everything. Otherwise, there was no point in saying anything, and why disturb Feng Nü's peace of mind?\n\nFeng Nü nodded, took a deep breath, condensed her Battle Qi into a needle shape, and lightly pricked her right index finger. Instantly, a drop of fresh blood fell into the bowl. Nianbing used a light magic spell to stop her bleeding. Both their gazes were fixed on the bowl, staring intently.\n\nThe two drops of blood slowly bloomed like two red flowers. Gradually, the two vibrant red masses drew closer. Feng Nü nervously clenched her fists. Nianbing also held his breath in tension, as this, after all, concerned Feng Nü's origins.\n\nFinally, the two crimson masses lightly touched. Before Nianbing and Feng Nü could react, the crimson blood quickly merged, becoming indistinguishable. The red continued to expand. Nianbing and Feng Nü were both a bit dazed. The blood kinship test was successful. For a moment, various thoughts flashed through Nianbing's mind. In his mind's eye, he seemed to see the scene from that year, seemed to see everything that had happened to Yu Ruyan and Feng Nü.\n\nFeng Nü stared blankly at the blood in the bowl. Her lips began to tremble slightly. She naturally understood what the merging of the blood meant. \"Relatives\" — these words had always been foreign in her mind. She couldn't fathom who Nianbing's \"relatives\" referred to. Yet, the blood before her was so real.\n\nAfter dealing with the blood and water in the bowl, a sincere smile appeared on Nianbing's face. He opened his arms and embraced Feng Nü. He could understand Feng Nü's complex emotions right now; what she needed was his comfort.\n\n\"Who is it? Whose blood is this, exactly?\" Feng Nü clung tightly to Nianbing's embrace. It seemed that only this warm embrace was the most reliable.\n\nNianbing didn't hesitate. He said softly, \"You've met this person. She's Yu Ruyan, whom you tried to capture and bring back in Olan City last time. She's also my godmother. She is your mother, and Duke Lanyu of the Olan Empire is your father.\"\n\nFeng Nü suddenly struggled out of Nianbing's embrace, her eyes filled with disbelief. \"No, no, how is this possible?\"\n\nNianbing gave a bitter smile, \"There's nothing impossible in this world. Not only does Phoenix Clan blood flow within you, but also the bloodline of Duke Lanyu. You should know that in the history of the Phoenix Clan, Yu Ruyan betrayed her clan and married Duke Lanyu, and the daughter they bore was supposedly burned to death by the Phoenix Clan. In truth, several elders of the Phoenix Clan had deep affection for my godmother. How could they truly harm her, or harm her flesh and blood? So, that eldest daughter who was supposed to be burned to death... that's you!\"\n\nThe color completely drained from Feng Nü's delicate face, and she stumbled back a few steps. \"They lied to me! The elders have been lying to me all this time! I have parents, I actually have parents, and my mother is a sinner within the clan? Why, why am I only finding all this out now? Why?\" Tears streamed down her beautiful face. Suddenly learning this truth, Feng Nü's heart was filled with all sorts of thoughts.\n\nNianbing quickly stepped forward and embraced her tightly twice. \"Feng Nü, do you know how much I envy you? Although you lost your parents' love in childhood, it wasn't because they abandoned you! Do you know how much pain my godmother suffered because of your 'death'? Now, it's been confirmed, you are their daughter. You have parents now, you have birth parents! You are so much stronger than me. I know where my parents are, but I can't go to them. Do you know how much I wish I could see my parents like you can?\"\n\nRecalling his suffering parents, and influenced by Feng Nü, Nianbing also cried. A pair of lovers, their hearts filled with both sorrow and joy because of their parents.\n\nGradually, Feng Nü calmed down, her sobs subsiding. She choked out, \"Nianbing, what should I do now? Tell me, what should I do now?\"\n\nNianbing wiped away his tears and said firmly, \"Of course you should go see them now. They are your parents! Don't you want to enjoy family bliss with them? Don't you wish to be with your parents?\"\n\nFeng Nü raised her head, her gaze toward Nianbing somewhat unfocused. \"Can I? Can I really do that? Nianbing, the Phoenix Clan raised me to adulthood and taught me powerful abilities, but my mother betrayed the clan and left. If I acknowledge them, how will the Phoenix Clan view me? Will they still let me go back and help the Phoenix Clan through this difficult time?\"\n\nNianbing gently kissed away the tears on Feng Nü's face and smiled slightly, \"Silly girl, what kind of person do you think my godmother is? In truth, she has never forgotten anything about the Phoenix Clan; she is also a member of the Phoenix Clan! Not only will she not stop you from helping the Phoenix Clan, but she had already planned to return to the Phoenix Clan to help her kin through their difficulties. It's just that the conditions set by the Phoenix Clan elders were too harsh, and she couldn't bear to leave your father, which is why she kept hesitating to go back. As long as you return, the estrangement between your parents and the Phoenix Clan will no longer exist, and everything will become harmonious. Back then, the reason your mother decided to betray the Phoenix Clan was because of your death! To put it another way, even if you weren't their daughter, if we continue to develop this relationship, as long as we truly love each other, one day you would also follow the same path as your mother. Think about it from her perspective: on one side, her deeply beloved husband, on the other, the clan that raised her. My godmother experienced too much of that pain of choice. Go back to her side. I can guarantee with my life that she will definitely return to the Phoenix Clan with you to help the clan overcome their difficulties. You know her strength well. With both of you joining, whatever that ceremony is will no longer be a threat to the Phoenix Clan. Both for public and private reasons, you must make a trip to the Duke's Estate and return to your parents' side.\"\n\nFeng Nü fell silent, nestled in Nianbing's embrace, constantly pondering. Every word Nianbing spoke deeply touched her heart. She was inherently a soft-hearted person. Thinking about the pain Yu Ruyan and her husband had endured, and then thinking about her own feelings for Nianbing, her bewildered heart gradually opened, and the sadness in her beautiful eyes slowly faded.\n\n\"Can you come back with me? Nianbing. I'm a little scared to go alone,\" Feng Nü said softly.\n\nNianbing was overjoyed. He knew that Feng Nü had recognized her parents in her heart. Indeed! They were family to begin with, separated by various misunderstandings and hardships, and it was time for their family to reunite. At this very moment, Nianbing desperately wanted to agree to accompany Feng Nü, but he couldn't. For the impending disaster that Galamandis and the other seven Dragon Kings were about to face, he couldn't leave, no matter the reason, even knowing it was extremely dangerous. Choosing this moment to tell Feng Nü everything was precisely to keep her away from the imminent danger.\n\nSlowly shaking his head, Nianbing whispered, \"Feng Nü, I'm sorry. I can't go to the Olan Empire right now. Galamandis and I just talked, and he told me my cultivation has reached its most critical point; one more step and I can enter the Archmage realm. Moreover, I... I must return to the Ice Moon Empire once. Do you remember Dragon Spirit? I must go back and see her. Furthermore, the competition I promised her father is over, and I need to go back and inform him.\"\n\nFeng Nü looked up at Nianbing, her eyes filled with disappointment, but she didn't demand anything. Normally, she would have noticed Nianbing's unusual expression and heard the insincerity in his words, but now her heart was in turmoil, making it impossible for her to think of these things. Being kind, she didn't ask for anything more and simply assented in silence.\n\nJust then, the footsteps of several Dragon Kings resounded. Nianbing quickly separated from Feng Nü, only to see Fatso, the Earth Dragon King; Galamandis, the Fire Dragon King; Ka'aodilisi, the Spatial Dragon King; Karodilisi, the Wind Dragon King; and Sasalisi, the Ice Dragon King, walk out together.\n\nKarodilisi irritably said, \"Keep thinking about others with your filthy mind, and stop meddling in their affairs.\"\n\nKa'aodilisi said discontentedly, \"Karo, no matter what, I'm your elder brother. Can't you be a bit more polite to me?\"",

    "content": "Salamander snorted, saying, \"Politeness depends on who it's for. If you weren't so useless, and your personality wasn't so annoying, would he treat you like this?\" After speaking, he ignored the Space Dragon King and gave Nian Bing an inquiring look.\n\nNian Bing took Fen Nu's hand and said, \"Salamander, I'm entrusting Fen Nu to you. Fen Nu, I'll ask Salamander to escort you out of Cold Ridge. Just keep walking east, and you'll soon enter the Oulan Empire. With your strength, there won't be much danger. Be careful on your journey, and once I've dealt with a few things, I'll come to Oulan City to find you, alright? By the way, please say hello to Godmother and Godfather for me.\"\n\nFen Nu gently nodded, looking deeply at Nian Bing, and said, \"I'll be fine, don't worry. Don't think too much about it. My parents, aren't they your parents too?\" After saying this, her pretty face couldn't help but flush slightly.\n\nNian Bing's heart was filled with deep affection. Fen Nu didn't forget to care about him even at this moment. With such a wife, what more could he ask for? He said no more, turning and nodding to Salamander.\n\nSalamander laughed heartily, saying, \"Come on up, little girl. This journey isn't short, and the environment is harsh, so I'll give you a ride.\" As he spoke, his towering form soared into the air. In an instant, the entire valley seemed to gain a cloud, a red cloud; the Fire Dragon King had revealed his true dragon form.\n\nFen Nu suddenly threw herself into Nian Bing's embrace and kissed his face. With a voice only Nian Bing could hear, she said, \"Take care.\" Only then did she float up, her delicate body turning in the air like a soaring bird, lightly landing on Salamander's broad back. Salamander let out a clear dragon roar, his massive dragon wings lightly flapped, and with a sudden acceleration, they vanished in the blink of an eye.\n\nNian Bing gazed deeply in the direction Fen Nu and Salamander had departed, unable to tear his eyes away for a long time.\n\n\"Alright, stop looking. They're gone. This girl is very good. When I told her I wouldn't harm you, she immediately agreed to let me do as I pleased with her. Kid. You really should cherish her.\"\n\nNian Bing withdrew his gaze and looked back at the Fatty who had spoken. For such a long time, he had been with Fen Nu. Whether it was their cohabitation in the Heavenly City of Dou Bucuotian, or later when Fatty captured her, Fen Nu had always been very close to him. Now that Fen Nu was gone, his heart felt somewhat empty, as if he had lost something. He understood that his love for Fen Nu had ascended to another level; in this life and world, he could never abandon it.\n\n\"Um, um, Nian Bing!\" Fatty chuckled, rubbing his hands together and saying, \"I've been flying for two days, and before that, I slept for ten days, so I'm a bit hungry. Look, could you make something to eat? Even barbecue would be great! Your barbecue tastes much better than mine.\"\n\nNian Bing glared at him, annoyed. \"Eat what? Roasted Earth Dragon?\"\n\nKaruodisili* let out a snort of laughter. \"Good, that's a really good idea. Fatty has thick skin and a lot of meat, and he's greasy too. If we roast him, he'll definitely taste great.\"\n\nFatty angrily said, \"Karu*, is your skin itching, or what?* Your mouth is truly annoying.\"\n\nKaruodisili chuckled slyly, saying, \"What? You don't mean you want to eat me, do you? Fatty, although I can't beat you, you can't catch me either. My saying a few words won't make you lose a chunk of flesh. Just bear with it.\"\n\nSasa seemed to dislike the Space Dragon King Karuodisili very much, and said coolly, \"Fatty, if I were you, I wouldn't tolerate it.\"\n\nKaruodisili was momentarily stunned. \"Beautiful Sasa, why are you stirring up trouble?\"\n\nSasa snorted, saying, \"I'm just stating facts.\"\n\nFatty gave a wry smile and said, \"I'll just tolerate it. I really can't catch this guy. He runs much faster than a rabbit.\"\n\nKaruodisili feigned anger and said, \"You good-for-nothing Fatty, how dare you compare me, the most handsome Space Dragon King, to a rabbit!\"\n\nAfter the few Dragon Kings' antics, Nian Bing's previously somewhat somber mood couldn't help but lighten considerably. He smiled slightly and said, \"Fatty, if you want to get back at him, I can certainly help you.\"\n\nKaruodisili said disdainfully, \"Human, perhaps you still don't know the might of me, the Space Dragon King. In this world, anywhere I wish to go, I can reach any corner of space. Although my attacking power is a bit lacking, when it comes to shifting, dodging, flying, and instant teleportation, I consider myself second among the Seven Dragon Kings, and absolutely no one would dare claim first.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled slyly, saying, \"Is that so? Fatty's fists are quite hard, you'd better think carefully.\"\n\nFatty seemed to think of something, gave Nian Bing a strange smile, and strode towards Karuodisili. Karuodisili immediately became wary, a faint silver light radiating from his body. \"Damn Fatty, what do you want to do?\"\n\nFatty chuckled slyly, then suddenly roared, \"Nian Bing, act!\"\n\nIn an instant, a layer of colorful light gracefully flowed out from Nian Bing's body. The light suddenly vanished the moment it appeared, then reappeared moments later, accompanying Nian Bing to a spot not far from Karuodisili. Twisted seven-colored light enveloped both Nian Bing and Karuodisili's bodies. Just as Karuodisili was about to use his spatial magic to escape Fatty's pursuit, he suddenly felt his body become sluggish. His proud spatial magic had actually failed. Although he was faster than Fatty, they were both Dragon Kings; how much faster could he really be? In just that moment of sluggishness, Fatty had already charged forward, delivering a heavy punch towards Karuodisili.\n\nAt this point, there was no possibility of dodging. Just as Karuodisili tried to defend himself, he suddenly realized with surprise that among the seven-colored light originally radiating around Nian Bing's body, the silver light had suddenly vanished, while the yellow light surged dramatically. A portion of the spatial energy he had raised was actually drawn away, while Fatty, full of Earth elemental magic, instantly expanded in size.\n\n\"Ah—\" Amidst the pained cry, the colorful light vanished. Karuodisili was sent flying high by Fatty's punch. They were all companions, and this was just playful roughhousing; Fatty naturally knew his limits. However, even so, this punch still caused Karuodisili considerable pain.\n\nFatty burst into laughter. \"So satisfying! I've always wanted to teach this guy a lesson. It's been a long time since I've thrown such a satisfying punch. Nian Bing, you're amazing! It's so satisfying to cooperate with your strange domain like this.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Although my Heavenly Eye Domain has no offensive capabilities, besides defense and amplification, it has a special ability. That is weakening. Within my domain, I can severely weaken the effect of any magic element. Therefore, his spatial transfer couldn't be used, and his attacking power was also greatly diminished.\"\n\nHearing Nian Bing's understated words, the Ice Dragon King Sasa and the Wind Dragon King Karuolodilis, who were standing by, were both moved. They looked at Nian Bing in surprise. Only then did they realize that they had indeed underestimated this human before. Being able to wield seven types of magic had always been a specialty of their dragon race, but they knew that they couldn't apply it with Nian Bing's subtlety.\n\n\"Damn it, that brat actually tricked me!\" Karuodisili finally fell from the air, his face somewhat twisted, and he continuously rubbed his stomach with both hands. The pain clearly put a great strain on him.\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"I'm just helping my friend. Fatty is, but you, at least for now, are not.\" He wasn't afraid of Karuodisili. Although even the weakest of the Seven Dragon Kings, the Space Dragon King, was still beyond his current ability to defeat, he was confident that Karuodisili wouldn't be able to harm him without using forbidden spells. He was gradually developing the marvelous uses of the Heavenly Eye Domain, and he was increasingly realizing that its effects far exceeded his estimations.\n\nJust as Karuodisili was about to act up, Sasa and Karuolodilis simultaneously flashed, already blocking his path.\n\nKaruodisili was stunned for a moment. \"What are you doing? Are you also going to help an outsider?\"\n\nKaruolodilis said calmly, \"Brother, I now understand why Fatty brought him here. Haven't you realized how much his domain can help us? With Dimanteeti unable to act, the assistance he provides us is immense.\" From Nian Bing's recent actions, they had already understood many things.\n\nSasa turned to Nian Bing and said, \"How large an area can your domain cover?\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment. He said, \"Under normal circumstances, it can cover three *zhang*.^1 With full activation, it should be able to extend to five *zhang*, but it won't last long. As you know, domains consume a lot of magical power.\"\n\nSasa nodded and said, \"That's enough. You'll be responsible for guarding the cave entrance. Fatty, Karu, and Karuolo will assist you.\"\n\nNian Bing turned around and glanced at the entrance of the cave. Indeed, the cave was three *zhang* high, precisely within the full coverage range of his domain. A strange smile appeared on his face as Nian Bing said, \"I still have some good things I'd like to 'gift' your enemies.\" Since he had decided to stay, he would give his all. Not just for the Seven Dragon Kings, but more importantly, for his own survival.\n\n\"What other good things?\" Fatty asked, looking at Nian Bing suspiciously. \"You should know that our enemies are very powerful and cannot be dealt with by ordinary abilities. Having your domain's help is already very good.\"\n\nNian Bing knew he was hinting for him not to act rashly, to avoid attracting danger. He smiled slightly and said, \"No hurry. Aren't you hungry? Let's eat something first. I remember you should have a few cows hidden away, right? Bring one out. But you'll have to help; I don't have that much strength.\"\n\nAt the mention of food, Fatty's eyes immediately lit up. \"Good, good.\" With a wave of his large hand, a majestic bull instantly appeared before everyone. Before the bull could even bellow, Fatty casually smashed its head with a single palm, then walked off, pulling it by the tail. \"You guys wait here. I'll clean up the bull and be right back.\"\n\nWatching the poor dead bull being dragged away by Fatty, Nian Bing couldn't help but think of Maomao's summoned beast. If that milk cow, capable of projectile attacks, were roasted, he wondered how it would taste. Perhaps Maomao would fight him to the death. Remembering Maomao's cute appearance, he couldn't help but show a knowing smile, and asked the Wind Dragon King, \"Karuolodilis, how are Senior Hilade and Maomao?\"\n\n---\n^1. A *zhang* is a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or 11 feet.\n^*. The original text uses \"卡傲迪里斯\" (Karuodisili) for the Space Dragon King, also referred to as \"Fatty\" (胖子) and later shortened to \"Karu\" (卡傲). \"卡羅迪里斯\" (Karuolodilis) is explicitly the Wind Dragon King, later shortened to \"Karuolo\" (卡羅).",

    "content": "Carlo Dierre smiled faintly. \"Good? Not good at all. That lass Mao Mao is getting naughtier and naughtier. This time, she even wanted to come with me. She's far too playful. Her father is constantly getting headaches because of her! However, that lass's talent is quite good. All of her little pets have already evolved to Tier 2. Lately, her father has been keeping her confined to practice magic.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled. \"She's still young, so it's natural for her to be a bit playful. But Mao Mao is a good girl; she's very kind.\"\n\nCarlo Dierre smiled. \"Your generation of young people is becoming more and more outstanding. It seems humanity's future hope lies with you. Nian Bing, I heard from Shilard about your previous encounter. He was far too reckless, but he acted that way out of his strong love for his daughter. Don't hold it against him.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Let bygones be bygones. Senior Shilard and I have already made things clear.\"\n\n\"That's good. After things here are done, if there's an opportunity, I'll take you to visit where they live. I think Mao Mao will be very happy to see you.\"\n\nNian Bing thought of Feng Nü and the hatred he carried, and gave a wry smile. \"We'll really have to wait for an opportunity to talk about it.\"\n\nJust then, Fatty returned, carrying the prepared ox. He had cleaned the ox thoroughly, somehow, even skinning it.\n\nCarlo Dierre couldn't help but laugh. \"You scoundrel, Fatty, you're probably only this fast when it comes to eating.\"\n\nFatty smirked. \"Making fun of me, are you? I'm the one who brought this ox. If you're so capable, don't eat it later.\"\n\nCarlo Dierre turned to Nian Bing. \"I've heard your cooking skills are exquisite. Why don't you show us what you've got?\"\n\nNian Bing gave a calm smile and walked over to Fatty. \"You're in charge of rotating the ox; leave the rest to me. Use a thicker piece of wood to skewer this ox.\"\n\n\"Alright, no problem.\" Fatty agreed. With a few leaps, he returned and skewered the ox's body with a thick, long branch. Holding it out with one hand, the ox, weighing four to five hundred *jin*, seemed as light as a feather in his grasp.\n\nSeeing Fatty ready, Nian Bing quickly got to work. The Space Ring flashed continuously, and in an instant, dozens of bottles and jars of various sizes were taken out. At the same time, he also took out a large seasoning box, constantly adding seasonings from various bottles and jars, stirring quickly with a chopstick.\n\nAs he did this, he muttered to himself, \"Roasting a whole ox isn't like roasting a whole lamb. Lamb is fattier and more tender than beef, and more nutritious. Also, due to its smaller size, it cooks faster. This ox weighs at least five hundred *jin*. If an ordinary chef were to roast it, they'd have to roast it for a while, eat the cooked outer meat first, and then continue roasting. Of course, that won't be necessary with me. Two things are most important when roasting meat: one is heat control. The other is the seasoning. Beef doesn't have as gamey a smell as lamb, so roasting an ox requires very particular seasoning.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Nian Bing stopped mixing the seasoning. He waved his left hand, and with a *boom*, a huge ball of flame instantly engulfed the entire ox. Fatty was clearly used to it, but it startled the other Dragon Kings.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Don't worry, this is just to clean off impurities, to make the beef cleaner.\" As his voice fell, a layer of frost enveloped the ox's body, and the flames immediately extinguished, leaving a black carbon-like substance on the surface of the ox.\n\nSeeing the blackened ox, Ka'ao Dierre couldn't help but say, \"Can this thing be eaten? And you said he's a good chef? Doesn't look like it to me.\"\n\nFatty laughed heartily. \"Then don't eat it later, but I know you're thick-skinned, so you probably won't be able to resist in the end. Nian Bing, show them what you're capable of.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"The quality of food can only be judged once it's fully cooked. As a chef, a good mindset is very important. I won't be affected by external factors. The successive appearance of fire and ice will make the beef surface more tender, and the resulting crispy skin will be more fragrant, and also absorb flavor more easily.\" A large brush appeared in Nian Bing's hand. He dipped it in the seasoning and first brushed the hollowed-out interior of the ox.\n\nThe seasoning was picked up with the brush and evenly spread into the ox's belly. The seasoning itself didn't emit any fragrance, but Nian Bing's movements were very fast. With one hand, he pulled open the ox's belly, and with the other, he rapidly turned his wrist. His movements were as smooth and natural as flowing clouds and running water, without any pause. Each turn of his wrist connected perfectly. In a moment, the inside of the ox's belly was brushed. Nian Bing didn't rush to the next step. He let out a low shout, and a scorching flame ignited from the ground. At the same time, he gestured to Fatty.\n\nFatty immediately understood. He switched from holding the ox with one hand to two, slowly rotating his wrists to ensure the ox's body was heated evenly. Nian Bing didn't try to remove the carbon layer on the ox's surface, letting it roast in his magic flames. Not long after, when the ox's body was evenly heated, Nian Bing said to Fatty, \"Listen up, I'm going to increase the heat of the fire. Use your Battle Qi to protect the ox's body. The flames must not directly burn it, but the heat must be transferred in.\" Roasting an ox was different from roasting smaller animals. Using ordinary flames, it would probably take a full day to cook it through. Fatty agreed, and a faint yellow light enveloped the ox's body. The instant the Battle Qi appeared, Nian Bing quietly chanted two incantations, and the light changed. The color of the flames instantly turned into blue True Fire.\n\nWisps of hot steam continuously rose from the ox. Under the heat of the roasting, the black carbon layer on the outside gradually fell off. Under the rapid high-heat roasting, the ox's outer surface turned light yellow, and a faint aroma of roasted meat emanated. Nian Bing didn't rush to act; he was still waiting. The heat control for any culinary creation had to be extremely precise. Only then could the best cuisine be made.\n\nSassaris sat quietly to the side, while the gazes of the brothers Ka'ao Dierre and Carlo Dierre were completely drawn to the roasted ox, especially Ka'ao Dierre, who had already begun to swallow his saliva.\n\nNian Bing suddenly moved. His hand raised, creating an afterimage that floated gracefully. A red light naturally leaped into the afterimage, and the ox's body continued to rotate. The red afterimage seemed to gently caress the ox's body without any change. In an instant, the flames on the ground, supported by magic, reverted to red, and the red light that danced like an elf in Nian Bing's hand also vanished.\n\nNo one saw clearly what Nian Bing did. Even the Dragon Kings present, who were all Divine Master-level besides Nian Bing, couldn't see Nian Bing's hands clearly. Since his mental and physical abilities had greatly improved, Nian Bing's Dragon God's Dance of United Arts blade technique had reached mastery. Even he himself couldn't clearly see his own hands. After striking, he relied solely on feeling. Of course, it wasn't impossible for him to see clearly, but he would need to use his third eye. The number one blade technique in the culinary world had completely integrated into Nian Bing's cooking. He had reached the Phantom Blade realm that Cha Ji had spoken of when teaching him his culinary skills. The blade moved with his mind, allowing him to master everything he wielded with the blade purely by feeling. Where his intent went, the blade reached, without a sound or trace. The moment the blade entered his hand, it seemed to connect with his body as one.\n\nThe flames reverted from True Fire to ordinary flames, and the temperature had greatly decreased. Nian Bing moved. He had somehow swapped to the seasoning box and large brush in his hands. He turned his wrists, quickly brushing a layer of seasoning onto the ox's surface. The seasoning itself seemed to have no scent, but under the heat of the roasting, a rich meat aroma mixed with the seasoning immediately ascended. The area within dozens of meters was filled with the fragrance of roasted meat, making Fatty, who was rotating the branch, stare fixedly, constantly inhaling the aroma, as if he wanted to smell his fill first.\n\nTime passed by the minute. Nian Bing was very calm; his skilled cooking had long since brought everything under his control. When the aroma grew thicker and thicker, and oil began to drip from the ox, he once again transformed the magic flames into blue True Fire. After three such cycles, and three applications of seasoning, the ox had shrunk considerably in overall size, but its aroma nearly spread throughout the entire valley. For a time, various carnivores in the valley were attracted to the vicinity, but they dared not approach easily due to the domineering Dragon Qi released by the Dragon Kings. At this point, even Sassaris, who usually had a cold and aloof expression, had his gaze fixed on the golden-brown ox. They were all waiting for the beef to fully cook. The golden-brown beef had various curled marks on its surface, all left by the Yang Cleansing Blade earlier.\n\nNian Bing cleaned the seasoning box and brush by melting ice into water, then put them back into his Space Ring. He carefully examined the ox, nodded slightly, and said, \"It's almost ready to eat.\" As he spoke, he made the first move, immediately taking out the Yang Cleansing Blade. He used magic to force out a blade aura and cut off a large piece of roasted meat, picking it up with a branch. This piece of meat was already enough for him to eat.\n\nAs soon as Nian Bing finished his move, three figures pounced forward. Fatty shrieked, ignoring the heat, and immediately grabbed the ox's two hind legs, turning to run. However, he couldn't compare to Sassaris and the others in speed. Carlo Dierre was the first to arrive, his hand glowing with a blue halo. With a forceful tug, an ox foreleg, along with a large amount of beef, was torn off. Hot steam billowed, and a rich aroma permeated the air. To the surprise of the Dragon Kings, the color inside the ox's belly was also golden-brown.\n\nCarlo Dierre had deliberately given way to Sassaris, so Ka'ao Dierre had caught up. The two brothers exchanged a palm strike with a *bang*. Carlo Dierre, whose power was stronger, immediately grabbed and tore off the other foreleg. Ka'ao Dierre only had time to grab a piece of beef that came off with his bare hands, acquiring far less of the delicious food than his brother.\n\nJust then, a hearty laugh rang out. \"It's better to arrive at the right time than to arrive early! What fragrant meat!\" Before Fatty could react, his left hand suddenly felt hot. Subconsciously, he let go, and an ox hind leg changed hands. Galamandis's familiar figure appeared beside him. The two of them pulled together forcefully, instantly splitting the ox into two halves. After seizing the beef, all four Dragon Kings, except for the unfortunate Ka'ao Dierre, released a layer of light belonging to their respective elements. Although Nian Bing couldn't distinguish whether it was magic or Battle Qi, he could clearly feel its intensity.\n\nKa'ao Dierre looked at the others with a wry expression. \"Damn it, you guys are too unscrupulous! You only left me this tiny piece of meat.\"\n\nFatty snickered. \"Who told you not to work hard usually? This is the difference in strength!\" He was the most pleased. Although Galamandis had snatched quite a bit in the end, he was, after all, in a position to benefit first, and the right hind leg he acquired, along with the attached meat, was clearly the most. He immediately began to eat heartily.\n\nNian Bing watched the five Dragon Kings vying for food and couldn't help but recall when he was learning from Cha Ji. Whenever he ate a bit too much, Cha Ji would say he was like a hungry wolf. Compared to the current situation, what was a hungry wolf? These were hungry dragons, and five of them at that! Although he didn't know how big their stomachs were, he presumed each of them had the ability to eat an entire ox.\n\nJust then, a gloomy voice emerged from the cave. \"Give me some beef. Dimantidi is very weak and needs some nutrition. Thank you.\" As the voice appeared, a tall figure walked out of the cave, accompanied by a chilling aura. It wasn't coldness, but a bone-chilling阴coldness. Looking at the man with the sinister aura before him, Nian Bing knew without asking that he was the Dark Dragon King, one of the Seven Dragon Kings, and couldn't help but look at him a few more times out of curiosity.\n\nGalamandis was just about to take a bite when he heard the Dark Dragon King's words. Ka'ao Dierre, who was nearby, still couldn't shake off his smug habit. He chuckled. \"This is the first time I've heard Kajiosys say 'thank you.' Did I mishear? I got the least just now, so don't covet my delicious food. Hehehehe. When is Dimantidi going to give birth anyway?\"\n\nKajiosys's gaze turned cold. \"Enough nonsense. If you provoke me, I'll eat your meat too.\" Although his expression was somewhat gloomy, he couldn't hide the fatigue on his face. He had worried himself sick over Dimantidi giving birth. Dragons require thousands of years to conceive, and the final birthing process is the most dangerous, requiring constant protection. Dimantidi was his beloved. For thousands of years, Kajiosys had guarded her side every moment for their child, fearing even the slightest mishap for his beloved wife.\n\nWith a flash of his figure, Galamandis appeared before Kajiosys and handed over the ox leg in his hand. \"This is for her. Don't worry, I haven't even touched a bite.\"",

    "content": "Kjaeosis's gaze shifted. Among the Seven Dragon Kings, he and Galamandis had fought countless times, mostly because of Dimantidi. The two had always been like fire and water, but after all, there was no real hatred between them. Kjaeosis nodded and said, \"I'll remember this favor. I thank you on behalf of Dimantidi.\"\n\nGalamandis said indifferently, \"Although I don't like you, we are family after all. For so many years, I've always wanted to surpass you in all aspects, and I've always believed I wouldn't lose to you in any way. However, I now have to admit that her choice of you was not wrong. You are a qualified husband. Don't worry, I won't bother you anymore in the future.\"\n\nKjaeosis was momentarily stunned. \"Galamandis, when did you change your tune?\" His rival's sudden show of goodwill made him somewhat uncomfortable, and for a moment he didn't know what to say.\n\nGalamandis smiled slightly and said, \"She's already your wife, what good would it do for me to keep thinking of her? Better to open my heart and pursue more beautiful things. Go quickly, if this beef gets cold, the taste will be much worse. I think Dimantidi will definitely love it. This beef is from humanity's most outstanding chef.\"\n\nThe Dark Dragon King Kjaeosis deeply looked at the Fire Dragon King Galamandis, then turned and walked towards the cave. Just as he was about to re-enter the cave, he suddenly stopped, turned to Nianbing, who was watching him not far away, and said, \"Thank you. Dimantidi hasn't had anything she wanted to eat for a long time. This beef you grilled looks like it tastes good.\" After speaking, he turned and walked into the cave.\n\nKa'aodiris chuckled, \"Human, I've lived for so many years and he's never thanked me. I didn't expect him to thank you the moment you arrived. That's really unfair! But, your grilled beef is really good.\"\n\nGalamandis said ill-temperedly, \"Eating still can't shut your mouth. Be careful, or I'll snatch yours.\" Hearing this, Ka'aodiris quickly sped up his swallowing, and indeed, stopped talking.\n\nGalamandis turned his gaze to the chubby man who was wolfing down his food, revealing an ill-intentioned look. Feeling his gaze, the chubby man's heart trembled. He said helplessly, \"Alright, I'll share some with you then. Don't look at me like that, as if you have that kind of hobby.\" Saying so, he tore off half the meat and threw it to Galamandis.\n\nGalamandis took the meat, laughing and scolding, \"You dead fatty, even if I had that kind of hobby, I wouldn't fancy you. With that figure of yours, hmph hmph. This meat was grilled by my brother, so naturally I should have a share.\"\n\nWatching everything unfold among the Seven Dragon Kings, Nianbing couldn't help but reveal a slight smile. Although they argued and fought, the affection between them was inadvertently revealed. Remembering how the chubby man had rushed over day and night as soon as he received the distress signal, he couldn't help but think to himself, \"If all humans could be like these Dragon Kings, perhaps there would have been no wars among humans long ago.\"\n\nThe meat was quickly finished. The gazes of Galamandis and the other four Dragon Kings fell upon the chubby man. The chubby man hastily stuffed the last bite of beef into his mouth. \"Why are you looking at me? I only brought one ox.\"\n\nKa'aodiris said, \"Who the hell would believe you? Hurry and contribute it! This beef is truly fragrant. Human, how did you do it? The same piece of beef can actually produce various different aromas.\"\n\nNianbing smiled slightly and said, \"Grilling meat over a fierce fire originally can't produce the best aroma, but during the grilling process, I not only added various special seasonings but also used a knife to cut hundreds of marks into the ox, allowing the flavor of the seasonings to penetrate deep into the meat. At the same time, I also infused fire elements into the ox's body, so during the grilling, every part of the ox's body could be heated evenly, and naturally, the taste was better. You're called Ka'aodiris, right? Actually, grilled ox meat can't be said to be the best, after all, there are raw material limitations. Unfortunately, I don't have that kind of best meat.\"\n\nKa'aodiris's eyes lit up. \"What kind of meat? Tell me quickly. As long as it exists on this continent, I can find a way to get it for you.\"\n\nNianbing chuckled, \"Of course, you're a Dragon King. You can definitely get this kind of supreme delicacy, and that is dragon meat! Haven't you heard the saying, 'Dragon meat in heaven, donkey meat on earth'? If I could grill you, I think the taste should be quite good.\" Ka'aodiris had previously questioned his cooking skills, so he took this opportunity to get his revenge, especially since Galamandis was there.\n\nAs expected, Ka'aodiris immediately flew into a rage upon hearing this. \"You stinking brat, you actually want to grill me? I'll grill you first!\" A surge of powerful flames suddenly erupted and swept towards Nianbing.\n\nNianbing thought to himself, \"Mimicry Magic.\" Unfortunately, dragon Mimicry Magic could only be used up to the ninth tier at most, and Ka'aodiris clearly had no killing intent; this fire magic was only sixth-tier. The Innate Domain naturally manifested, seven-colored light suddenly flashed brightly, and the red light dimmed, having already swallowed the flame attack released by Ka'aodiris. Nianbing's Innate Domain merely fluctuated slightly.\n\nGalamandis's figure flickered, and he appeared in front of Nianbing. Ignoring Ka'aodiris, he used his body to shield Nianbing and said to him, \"Aren't you going to ask me where I sent Feng Nü?\"\n\nNianbing smiled slightly, looking at him, and said, \"Do I need to ask?\" His gaze showed trust. Galamandis was stunned for a moment before laughing loudly, \"Exactly! No need to ask, no need to ask.\"\n\nNianbing said, \"From now on, do not leave within fifty zhang* of the cave entrance. I'm going to set up some things, which I think will be somewhat useful for dealing with enemies.\" Saying so, he turned and walked outside.\n\nGalamandis was about to stop Nianbing but was prevented by the Wind Dragon King Karodiris. Karodiris smiled slightly and said, \"If my guess is correct, his setup will indeed be very useful.\"\n\nIt wasn't until nightfall that Nianbing returned to the cave entrance. By this time, he was already very tired. He sat down directly at the entrance, said nothing, and immediately entered a state of cultivation. Since being able to perform Innate Cultivation, Nianbing had discovered that as long as he could absorb the Innate Qi from heaven and earth, he wouldn't feel hunger or thirst even without eating or drinking. The five Dragon Kings were arranged in a formation of three in front and two behind. With Nianbing at the entrance were the chubby man and the Space Dragon King Ka'aodiris, while Galamandis sat cross-legged directly in front of Nianbing. To his left and right were the Ice Dragon King Sasaris and the Wind Dragon King. Being in the center surrounded by the five Dragon Kings, combined with the constant influx of light and dark aura from behind, the seven elemental magic elements were exceptionally dense. The rate at which his previously depleted Master-level magic power was replenished astonished even Nianbing. If he could continue cultivating like this, reaching the Archmage realm would be an easy feat.\n\nIn his cultivation state, Nianbing deliberately closed his Heavenly Eye, allowing the Innate Qi to circulate entirely within his body. Absorbing the dense magic elements, the feeling of being \"like a fish in water\" quickly immersed him in the wonderfulness of cultivation. The Innate Domain was actually a form of expression of his own energy. As he cultivated after gaining the Innate Domain, Nianbing gradually understood the origin of his Innate Domain. The most fundamental reason for him being able to possess the Innate Domain was, of course, the body given by his parents. His parents belonged to the water and fire attributes respectively, and he had successfully inherited the abilities of these two attributes. This laid an excellent foundation. Cultivating magic from a young age allowed his physique to constantly absorb the energy brought by magic elements. Especially after he later obtained the Stone of the Flame God and the Stone of the Ice Goddess, this absorption process became even faster. As time passed day by day, he gradually acquired one Magic Divine Blade after another. Although he could not fully utilize their energy at that time, these Magic Divine Blades had been subtly transforming his body, making his foundation gradually solid through the vast energy they possessed. Not long ago, he opened his Heavenly Eye Acupoint, allowing him to absorb the Innate Qi from heaven and earth. This not only elevated his magic to a higher level but also completely transformed his body from a post-natal state to an innate state. Absorbing a large amount of energy from the seven magic blades, the foundation of his Innate Domain, which had always remained within his body, continuously improved under such nourishment. During the chubby man's three months of \"torment,\" the Innate Domain finally successfully awakened. The reason Nianbing's Innate Domain was so peculiar was related to the seven magic blades, the chubby man's divine power, and his own physique. The effects demonstrated by its three abilities—amplification, defense, and weakening—had pushed him to a realm where he could contend with Archmages.\n\nTime unknowingly flowed by. The five Dragon Kings were ancient beasts that had lived for tens of thousands of years; naturally, they wouldn't care about this little bit of time. And Nianbing, in this wonderful cultivation process, also forgot the existence of time. The seven solid energy spheres rotating at two different speeds within his body continuously grew stronger. Forgetting time and dedicating oneself wholeheartedly to cultivation undoubtedly yielded the most significant results.\n\n\"Ah—\" Who knew how much time had passed, when a shocking shriek came from within the cave. The entire mountain seemed to tremble because of it. The huge sound wave made the five Dragon Kings open their eyes simultaneously. Galamandis's whole body trembled slightly, and his expression already showed some panic. They all knew that the Light Dragon King Dimantidi was about to give birth, the first dragon to bear a dragon offspring among the Seven Dragon Kings.\n\nThe emergence of the sound wave, coupled with the change in the surrounding magical aura, awakened Nianbing from his meditation. The benefits of the Heavenly Eye Acupoint gradually unfolded; one of its abilities was to withdraw one's mind, allowing him to not be disturbed during cultivation. Once external changes occurred, the energy aura would affect the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, enabling Nianbing to awaken in time. He opened his eyes, perplexed, and subconsciously asked, \"What was that sound just now?\" The words had barely left his mouth when another shriek came, the sound even stronger than before.\n\nGalamandis said in a deep voice, \"Dimantidi is about to give birth. From now on, we must concentrate fully on defense. From laying the dragon egg to hatching life, even for us Dragon Kings, it takes at least three to seven days. During this period, Dimantidi will be extremely weak, and Kjaeosis must fully help her through this difficult time. What we need to do is prevent any creatures from disturbing them.\"\n\nThe second shriek sounded at this moment. Dimantidi's voice seemed somewhat hoarse and strained, and simultaneously, Kjaeosis's low and hurried breathing could be heard from deep within the cave.\n\nSuddenly, Galamandis's expression changed. He said, \"This is bad. Dimantidi has the purest light physique. For her and Kjaeosis to combine and give birth to a dragon offspring will be much more difficult than for ordinary dragons. And at this moment, Kjaeosis protecting her with his magic is utterly useless. As a Dark Dragon King, his energy will only harm Dimantidi. Quick, let's go in and help first.\"\n\nAs expected, Kjaeosis's voice resounded from deep inside the cave. His voice had lost its cold aura and was filled with anxiety. \"You all, come in quickly! Dimantidi might have a difficult labor.\"\n\nThe five Dragon Kings frowned simultaneously. At this moment, external enemies could arrive at any time, and if Dimantidi had a difficult labor, things would become extremely hard to say. The five Dragon Kings rushed into the cave at their fastest speed. Galamandis, afraid that Nianbing might be in danger alone outside, tucked him under his arm. Soon, they arrived inside the cave. The further they went into the cave, the wider the surroundings became. When they reached the deep part of the cave, they found that there was no strange magical aura present, but instead, it was filled with vibrant life force. Perhaps it was precisely because of this immense life force that the Dark Dragon King and the Light Dragon King chose to give birth here. After all, neither light nor dark aura would cause harm to one of them. In the cave, a beautifully shaped, gigantic golden dragon lay prostrate in the center of the cavern, her entire body emitting a strong golden glow, and surging light aura continuously flickered around her.\n\nThe Light Dragon King Dimantidi painfully closed her eyes. Her massive body trembled continuously, and with each tremor, some golden liquid was left beneath her. The Dark Dragon King Kjaeosis, meanwhile, had a face full of anxiety but was unable to help. Galamandis flew to Kjaeosis's side and whispered, \"What's wrong? Why is she suddenly having a difficult labor?\"\n\nKjaeosis said bitterly, \"I don't know either. Perhaps it's because our energies are too extreme and too vast. The energy aura of the child born is very strange. Dimantidi and I already had a feeling earlier, but it wasn't until a few days ago after that group of people attacked that this feeling suddenly intensified. Dimantidi's life force is constantly decreasing, and she can't lay the dragon egg. I'm afraid it's a difficult labor. What should we do? What should we do now? Galamandis, help her, please help her!\" With his beloved facing a life-threatening crisis, Kjaeosis's heart was in chaos.\n\n---\n*A zhang (丈) is a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or 10.9 feet.",

    "content": "Galamandis also showed a bitter smile on his face. He looked at the other dragon kings and said, \"Don't panic yet. Panicking now is useless. We don't know how to help you! If you're talking about killing enemies or defending against them, we will naturally go all out. But giving birth, do you think any of us have experience with that? And your two situations are so strange, only the Dragon God probably knows what to do.\"\n\nKatyosis anxiously said, \"Then what should we do now? The energy fluctuations within Dimantti's body are extremely intense, and the energy fluctuations are extremely bizarre. Neither of us can control this energy. If this continues, I'm afraid she won't be able to hold on. Given Dimantti's situation, we can't even combine the power of the seven of us to contact the Dragon God. What do we do? What do we do now?\"\n\n\"Can I try?\" Nianbing, who had been standing by, suddenly spoke. The six dragon kings, excluding Dimantti, immediately focused their gazes on him. Katyosis showed a look of doubt and inquiry.\n\nNianbing said, \"Since none of you have a way now, why not let me try. I think your child must have inherited two extreme energies, light and darkness, which caused this mutation. I am an ice-fire dual-origin mage, and I have some experience with merging extreme magical energies. Perhaps I can find a way to help the Light Dragon King. As long as the method works, if you all act together, you should be able to save her.\" Indeed, although all Seven Dragon Kings could use mimicry magic, their mimicry magic was different from Nianbing's. Nianbing used his ice-fire dual origin as a conduit, directly attracting other elemental magical energies for his own use, while the Seven Dragon Kings directly used their own powerful elemental energies to mimic the effects of other elemental magic. Fundamentally, they were different, especially when dealing with the fusion of extreme magical energies. No matter how strong the Seven Dragon Kings were, they didn't have as deep an understanding as Nianbing. Nianbing also only offered the suggestion after sensing the energy changes in Light Dragon King Dimantti.\n\nAt this point, Katyosis was desperate for a cure*, unwilling to give up even a sliver of hope. He quickly said, \"Alright, then you try first. As long as you can save my wife and child, I'll agree to any condition you name.\" His breathing became more rapid, and a chilling dark aura flickered in and out of existence, seemingly on the verge of erupting at any moment.\n\nNianbing walked towards Dimantti while saying, \"I don't need any repayment from you. Galamandis is my friend, and you are his friend. What repayment is needed for help between friends?\"\n\nAlthough the light aura emanating from Dimantti's body was very unstable, being bathed in light made Nianbing feel very comfortable. When he walked to about ten feet** from Dimantti, a gentle energy blocked his advance; it was Dimantti's own defensive power. A light flashed in Nianbing's eyes, and his Innate Domain*** naturally opened, seven-colored light drifting out and surrounding his body. Under Nianbing's control, the light element within his Innate Domain was immediately weakened, and he took a few steps forward. He had already entered Dimantti's defense. Dimantti's whole body trembled, and her aura became even more unstable. At this moment, the gazes of the six dragon kings were all focused on Nianbing, and Katyosis was enduring his inner unease, anticipating a miracle.\n\nNianbing said softly, \"Light Dragon King, please don't reject my energy. Trust me, I am Galamandis's friend; I'm here to help you.\" After speaking, he immediately expanded his Innate Domain, enveloping Dimantti's body within it. The seven energies possessed by the Heavenly Eye Domain**** instantly became balanced, and the seven magical elements slowly spread towards Dimantti's body simultaneously.\n\nWith his Heavenly Eye open, after the seven magical elements entered Dimantti's body, Nianbing's Heavenly Eye could clearly see the situation inside Dimantti. Just as he expected, Dimantti was extremely weak at this moment, not from a lack of energy – her light energy was extremely powerful – but her internal body was being constantly torn apart by extreme energies. That extreme energy appeared in her lower abdomen. Nianbing knew that with Dimantti's power, she could naturally completely pulverize these energies and expel them from her body. However, she clearly didn't want to do that, because if she did, the dragon child she and Dark Dragon King Katyosis had nurtured for a thousand years would also be finished. Therefore, she would rather endure intense pain than harm her child. At this time, the meridians and flesh near the dragon egg had already been somewhat eroded and damaged by that extreme energy, which was why golden blood was flowing from beneath Dimantti. Great maternal love moved Nianbing's heart. He no longer hesitated. Guided by his Heavenly Eye, he carefully controlled his seven energies to Dimantti's lower abdomen. He enveloped the mutated energy generated by extreme repulsion. Relying on the seven different magical elements and the wondrous use of the Heavenly Eye Domain, Nianbing weakened the negative effects produced by that extreme energy. He forcefully enveloped the dragon egg inside Dimantti with his domain, slowly absorbing and weakening the energy. The effect of the seven elemental magical elements not only isolated Dimantti from the intense pain she was suffering but also protected the dragon egg. Although the weakened extreme energy was still raging and causing various mutations inside the dragon egg, as long as Nianbing's Heavenly Eye Domain remained, Dimantti's body would no longer be harmed.\n\nAt this moment, Nianbing already felt somewhat strained. After all, it was his first time controlling the Heavenly Eye Domain in such a way. And Dimantti's body was too powerful; although she tried her best to relax her body and mind, it still had a considerable impact on Nianbing's domain. Furthermore, the bizarre energy raging within the dragon egg was greatly consuming Nianbing's magic power. While maintaining his domain, Nianbing said, \"Light Dragon King, you can now use light energy to repair your body. With my domain active, I guarantee your child will not be harmed. Only by perfecting your own body can you give birth to it.\"\n\nDimantti's body, which had been trembling, stopped as the pain disappeared. She seemed to sigh in relief, breathing heavily. Her tightly closed dragon eyes slowly opened, and she looked at Nianbing gratefully. The light energy she had suppressed surged forth, restoring the damaged parts of her lower abdomen. The golden light gradually transformed into holy white light, and the light energy around her body was no longer as unstable as before. As Dimantti began to repair her body, the surge of light energy increased its impact on Nianbing's domain. Nianbing endured with gritted teeth, summoning his seven magic blades. It was only through the effect of the seven top-grade magic gems on the blades that he barely managed to stabilize his Heavenly Eye Domain.\n\nKatyosis, Galamandis, and the others immediately breathed a sigh of relief when they saw Dimantti's condition greatly improve. Katyosis grabbed Galamandis's shoulder, his eyes showing intense gratitude. \"Thank you, thank you, Galamandis. If it weren't for your friend, I'm afraid...\" Galamandis smiled slightly and said, \"Don't say so much. As long as Dimantti is alright, that's enough.\"\n\nThe Fatty***** laughed heartily and said, \"Congratulations, congratulations, Katyosis. You're probably going to be a father soon. You should thank me too! This kid Nianbing was brought by me.\"\n\nDimantti's light energy was indeed astonishing. Despite such severe internal damage, it was rapidly repairing under the effect of light energy. Sweat had already begun to stream down Nianbing's forehead. He continuously gathered magic power through his seven blades while struggling to sustain his domain. He knew very well that Dimantti's energy was too powerful. Coupled with the energy of that egg, it was impossible for him, with his current Heavenly Eye Domain, to help Dimantti give birth to the child. After all, any single dragon king was far stronger than him. Fortunately, the situation had now been clarified, and what to do next would be much easier.\n\nNianbing took a deep breath, fully stabilizing his domain, and said in a deep voice, \"Seven Dragon Kings, you must listen carefully to what I am about to say. In a moment, you will take over my current work. My energy is too weak, insufficient to help the Light Dragon King give birth to the child. All seven of you must work together for it to be born. Furthermore, from my observation, this child of the Light Dragon King and Dark Dragon King is very strange. Its energy no longer belongs to any of the seven elements. It should be mutated energy. Therefore, you must not only help the Light Dragon King give birth to the dragon egg, but also help her incubate it together. Only with the combined power of the seven of you can all this be achieved. Otherwise, even if the Light Dragon King is saved, this child cannot be saved. I am currently enveloping this dragon egg with my Innate Domain, weakening the mutated energy inside it through the domain, so that it will not affect the Light Dragon King's body. Although your abilities cannot weaken it, with the power of the seven of you, you can completely control the various energy fluctuations of the dragon egg. What you need to do is very simple: simultaneously input energy into the Light Dragon King's body, protecting this dragon egg in her lower abdomen. As long as the seven elemental energies remain balanced, coupled with the Light Dragon King's own powerful energy, giving birth to this child will not be difficult. Do you understand what I mean?\"\n\nKatyosis nodded and said, \"You mean, for all seven of us to work together, use seven elemental energies to protect the dragon egg, and then help Dimantti give birth to it?\"\n\nGalamandis said with some worry, \"Must we use all seven elemental energies? Can we use fewer types? In the current situation, if all seven of us help Dimantti, who will guard?\"\n\nAs soon as Galamandis spoke these words, the cave immediately fell silent. They all knew how powerful the approaching enemies were, and it would be impossible to withstand the enemy's attack without at least four dragon kings. But Dimantti's situation was so perilous; for a moment, the dragon kings were plunged into a dilemma. They all fixed their gaze on Nianbing, hoping that at least one or two dragon kings would not have to participate in the process of helping. Nianbing shook his head helplessly and said, \"That's impossible. The energy of this dragon egg is extremely bizarre. Only by deploying seven elemental energies simultaneously and maintaining a balanced state can it be stabilized. If even one type of energy is missing from the protection, it will turn into destruction. Therefore, all seven energies must be used simultaneously. Galamandis, do you trust me?\"\n\nGalamandis nodded and said, \"Of course we trust you. You have already earned our trust through your actions. Tell us, what other method is there?\"\n\nNianbing gritted his teeth and said, \"If you trust me, hand over the defense task to me. However, I hope you can give me the remaining four Maodas Seal Bottles. Only with them can I possibly protect you all. The enemy's main objective is these four bottles, not to eliminate you. When it comes down to it, I would rather destroy the remaining four bottles than hand them over to them. I have already arranged a dozen****** Eternal Sleep Domains around this mountain. Relying on these domains and the bottles I possess, I should be able to hold on for a while. During this time, you must fully focus on incubating the dragon egg. As soon as the little Dragon King is born, immediately come and help me repel the enemy. You need to decide quickly. My domain is almost unable to hold on.\"\n\nThe six dragon kings looked at each other, none of them speaking. Katyosis said decisively, \"Nianbing, thank you for your kindness. I trust you.\" As he spoke, a black light flashed in his hand, and a Maodas Seal Bottle immediately appeared. The Ice Dragon King and Wind Dragon King sighed simultaneously and also took out the bottles they were guarding. Dimantti sprayed a golden ray of light, completing the set of four bottles.\n\nNianbing took a deep breath, reinforced his domain once more, and said to the Seven Dragon Kings, \"Alright, you can begin. First, carefully input energy into the Light Dragon King's body and coordinate it with her own energy. Control the energy to be exactly the same in strength, then come and take over my current position.\" At this point, the internal injuries within Dimantti's body had already healed under the immense light energy.\n\nThe six dragon kings, with Katyosis leading them, dared not delay. Their figures flickered, and they each placed a palm on Dimantti from six different directions. They knew that every minute they gained would increase the chances of successfully hatching the little Dragon King. The power of the Seven Dragon Kings was at least equivalent to seven God Mages, and furthermore, their Dragon Language magic possessed unique characteristics. They had lived on this continent for tens of thousands of years. Although they only met once in a very long time, they had long since developed an excellent understanding of each other. Nianbing did not wait long; seven vast and powerful energy auras had already formed a barrier, surrounding them.\n\nNianbing breathed a sigh of relief, carefully withdrew his Innate Domain, and let the Seven Dragon Kings take over his previous position. But fearing the Seven Dragon Kings might not control it well, he still used his Heavenly Eye to observe the situation inside Dimantti. His worry was entirely unnecessary; the Seven Dragon Kings' control over energy had reached a state of exquisite perfection*******. With their combined energy, they easily controlled the energy around the dragon egg. Under the contractions of Dimantti's body, the dragon egg slowly expelled outwards, simultaneously releasing and absorbing the mutated energy.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n*   \"desperate for a cure\" (有病亂投醫 - literally: sick and consulting random doctors): An idiom meaning to be desperate for a solution and willing to try anything, even if it's ill-advised.\n**  \"ten feet\" (一丈): A traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or 10 feet.\n*** \"Innate Domain\" (先天領域): A specific magical technique or ability possessed by the character.\n**** \"Heavenly Eye Domain\" (天眼領域): A specific magical technique or ability, often implying enhanced perception or insight.\n***** \"The Fatty\" (胖子): Refers to a character, implied to be known by this moniker within the story's context.\n****** \"a dozen\" (十數個): Literally \"ten-plus\" or \"tens of,\" indicating an approximate number greater than ten, here \"a dozen\" fits the context for natural flow.\n******* \"exquisite perfection\" (妙到毫顛 - literally: marvelous to the tip of a hair): An idiom describing something that has reached an extremely subtle, precise, or perfect state.",

    "content": "Recalling his magic aura and Heavenly Eye ability completely, Nian Bing felt a wave of weakness throughout his body; after all, his previous consumption was too great. He dared not delay, quickly placed the four Moaodas Seal Bottles taken out by the Dragon Kings into his Space Ring, cutting off external respiration, and absorbing the surrounding innate aura and magic elements. Since he had taken on the heavy responsibility of defense, he had to adjust his state. He had never seen a Lich, but he had some understanding of how powerful Netherworld Sorcerers were. Back then, even Shilard had felt terror due to the appearance of a Netherworld Sorcerer. These two powerful fellows would probably be very difficult for him to deal with. Now, he could only hope that the magic arrays he had set up would have some good effects.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was continuously recovering his magic power with a feeling of apprehension, not far from this valley, in a recently artificially excavated ice cave, it was filled with dark and evil energy.\n\nNetherworld Sorcerer Safin had fully recovered his strength with the help of his master, Xie Yue. A powerful aura faintly appeared and disappeared within the ethereal black mist. \"Evil Lord, should we continue with our action? With the Seven Dragon Kings all gathered, I'm afraid it will be difficult for us to gain an advantage. With your ability, you can at most handle two to three Dragon Kings simultaneously. Besides the Dark Dragon King guarding the Light Dragon King, there are at least five other Dragon Kings responsible for protection. As long as they hold their ground and don't come out, it will be difficult for us to achieve anything.\"\n\nXie Yue stood with his hands behind his back; the surrounding cold had no effect on him. Safin's judgment was very accurate. Although the Light Dragon King, who posed the greatest threat among the Seven Dragon Kings, was unable to act due to childbirth, the Dragon Speech magic of the other Dragon Kings was also not to be trifled with. Having planned for many years, he did not want all his efforts to go to waste. However, to give up just like that, he was truly unwilling.\n\nPacing back and forth in the cave, Xie Yue was also continuously thinking. Should he act or give up? He was unwilling, truly unwilling. If he could obtain all the Moaodas Seal Bottles, he could open the lost kingdom he dreamed of. At that time, the promise from back then would surely be fulfilled, and all his wishes would become possible. However. The Seven Dragon Kings were absolutely the strongest on this continent. With all Seven Dragon Kings present, even if two didn't participate in battle, it would probably...\n\n\"My Lord Evil Lord, it's better to decide soon. I just sensed a fluctuation in life aura. I'm afraid that Light Dragon is about to give birth. We still have three days. According to estimates, the Light Dragon will take at least three days to complete both childbirth and incubation.\" A black figure emerged from the shadowy corner; she walked directly to Xie Yue's side, leaning gently against him. It was none other than Vampire Princess Sina.\n\nXie Yue embraced Sina's slender waist, remained silent for a moment before saying: \"This operation cannot be canceled. Our appearance the day before yesterday has already made the Seven Dragon Kings vigilant. If we let go of this opportunity, we might never get another chance. So even if there are sacrifices, we must act. I've stated this beforehand: once the operation begins, if anyone recoils without my command, don't blame me for being impolite. All right, start preparing now. We'll act in three hours.\"\n\nHearing Xie Yue's decision, Netherworld Sorcerer Safin said nothing more. Although he was a Netherworld Sorcerer, he was currently just a high-ranking enforcer under Xie Yue. Moreover, just as Xie Yue said, if they missed this opportunity, they might truly never get another one.\n\nEvil energy continuously gathered in the cave; the entire Cold Ridge was completely in a state of impending storm.*\n\n...\n\nNian Bing sat cross-legged, meditating while observing the actions of the Seven Dragon Kings. Half an hour had passed; the Light Dragon King Dimanteddie's expression gradually changed from relaxed to tense again. Although the other six Dragon Kings did not show signs of struggle, their expressions were unusually solemn. Evidently, Dimanteddie was about to give birth.\n\nNian Bing's magic power recovered quickly due to being near the Seven Dragon Kings. Magic elements continuously gathered, coupled with the converged innate aura, the consumption caused by the overuse of his Innate Domain had gradually recovered. It wouldn't take long for him to return to his optimal state.\n\nSuddenly, the Seven Dragon Kings' bodies trembled simultaneously. A faint halo drifted out from beneath the Light Dragon King Dimanteddie's abdomen. What appeared first was surprisingly black light, immediately followed by the black light gradually turning white, and then, it surprisingly turned gray. Within the light, an egg-shaped object was vaguely enveloped. It was Nian Bing's first time seeing a dragon egg, and he couldn't help but widen his eyes.\n\nThe egg was about two feet long; its spherical body emitted gray light. The eggshell was extremely smooth. As soon as it appeared, it was immediately lifted into the air by the Seven Dragon Kings' seven different colored magical powers of various elements. The seven energies simultaneously intensified, tightly enveloping the egg. The egg was finally born; next was the incubation process.\n\nNian Bing secretly sighed in relief; he knew the first hurdle had passed. He hoped no problems would arise later. With the egg born, he no longer stayed inside the cave, turned and walked outside. He walked all the way to the cave entrance before sitting down cross-legged again to meditate, while constantly paying attention to all movements around him. While meditating, Nian Bing secretly prayed in his heart, \"Little Dragon King, you must come out quickly, otherwise, I'll be doomed.\"\n\nAt this moment, Nian Bing felt time passing so slowly. Although his magic power was recovering quickly, even if it fully recovered, he wouldn't be able to face the unknown crisis!\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, when Nian Bing's magic power had fully recovered and was abundant, he leapt up from the ground. He summoned his seven magic daggers from his Space Ring and plunged them into the ground at the cave entrance. Closing his eyes, he focused his mental power on his Heavenly Eye acupoint, paying attention to all movements around him.\n\nSuddenly, Nian Bing's mental power stirred. He abruptly opened his eyes, sighing inwardly, \"What should come has come.\" Although he wished for danger to stay away from him and hoped to live better, since what should come had already arrived, he would not flinch. At this moment, his mood became calm instead, standing there calmly waiting.\n\n\"No, you bastard.\" Safin roared in anger; a huge energy appeared from nowhere, surprisingly drawing away its mental power. Although the Netherworld Sorcerer's mental power was no weaker than that of a Dragon God, it couldn't withstand such continuous extraction!\n\nA dozen or so Netherworld Demons had already fallen to the ground, losing the ability to move. More than half of the subordinates brought by Vampire Princess Sina also collapsed to the ground. Their mental power was much weaker; the sudden loss caused immense burden on their bodies.\n\nAmong all of them, only Xie Yue and Vampire Princess Sina were unaffected. A faint blue light flashed in Xie Yue's eyes; he let out a low and sinister roar. A circle of dark green light drifted out, enveloping all the subordinates he had brought; only then did it cut off the mental power extraction.\n\n\"What a clever magic array. Since when did these Dragon Kings start setting up magic arrays? This is clearly prepared for us.\" Streaks of faint green light drifted out and disappeared in a flash.\n\nNian Bing at the cave entrance suddenly trembled, his consciousness became blurry for a moment. He said in horror: \"How ruthless, they actually broke four of my Eternal Slumbers at once. Are these guys even human? How did they do it?\" He had always been very confident in the magic array called Eternal Slumber. But he didn't expect the frontal magic array to be broken so easily by the opponent. Of course, he didn't know that Xie Yue, as the Evil Lord, was currently filled with anger. His originally powerful dark forces had lost over 30% of their combat strength under the effect of this hidden magic array.\n\nThe appearance of the Eternal Slumber magic array not only didn't deter Xie Yue from advancing, but instead deepened his confidence in this trip. Because he believed that for the proud Dragon race to actually use magic arrays, there must be a reason, a reason he didn't know, but it should be disadvantageous to the Dragon Kings.\n\nThe warm, spring-like valley gradually grew somewhat cold. It wasn't cold air, but a faint chill. Nian Bing was waiting. Waiting for the enemy's arrival. He had already drawn an Ice-Fire Homologous Hexagram on the ground at the cave entrance. At this moment, he couldn't help but miss his Hedgehog Vest. If he had the magic scroll for that vest, perhaps he could have resisted a bit longer.\n\nInside the cave, there was still no movement; evidently, successful incubation wouldn't happen in a short time.\n\nThe ground began to show slight tremors. Nian Bing's heart tightened. He knew the enemy had arrived.\n\nSuddenly, dozens of *zhang* away in front of him, cracks suddenly appeared in the ground. One after another, pale white bone claws stretched out from beneath the cracks. A rattling sound carried a strong sense of fear. One by one, skeletons jumped out from the cracks. Each skeleton held a bone knife in its hand. Their movements were very slow. A faint green light emanated from the eye sockets of their skulls. The sound of bones rubbing made Nian Bing's scalp tingle. It was his first time seeing such things.\n\nThe number of skeletons grew, seemingly with no intention of stopping. The skeletons seemed to have detected the life aura emanating from Nian Bing, and one by one, they lined up neatly, raising their bone knives high, continuously advancing towards Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing didn't move; he wasn't anxious. The psychological pressure the skeletons brought him was far more effective than the strength they could display. The appearance of the skeletons filled the entire valley with an aura of deathly silence. Every step they took, Nian Bing's heart would thump.\n\nFinally, the psychological pressure made Nian Bing unable to endure any longer. His Heavenly Eye acupoint opened, scanning the large expanse of skeletons in front. He discovered that inside the heads of these skeletons, there was a ball of green flame, and this flame was clearly the source of power for the skeletons' actions. Nian Bing didn't know how these death creatures came to be, but they certainly weren't his friends.\n\n\"Ascend. Holy Light that pierces the heavens! You represent boundless light, illuminating the earth. Transform, aura of Holy Light, in the shimmering of Ice-Fire Homologous, bloom your sacred splendor. Holy Light.\" The Holy Light that pierces the heavens suddenly became brilliant. A gentle milky-white halo continuously gathered in front of Nian Bing. The skeleton soldiers, who were originally advancing rhythmically, seemed to be very wary of this milky-white light, and their advancing steps halted. They seemed to be waiting for something.\n\nSuddenly, a sharp whistling sound echoed from afar. The skeleton soldiers seemed to forget everything; their originally somewhat clumsy bodies became unusually agile. One after another, they rushed towards Nian Bing, falling over each other. A layer of green light appeared on their bones.\n\nNian Bing's eyes, at this moment, had turned into milky-white light. Through his Heavenly Eye acupoint, he could clearly see every movement of these skeleton soldiers.\n\nThe milky-white halo instantly bloomed, Holy Light illuminated the earth, spreading into the distance.\n\nHoly Light, also the Light of Purification, had the best effect on dark creatures. Wherever the milky-white halo passed, the skeletons' bodies melted like ice and snow, turning into piles of ash that vanished with the gentle breeze. Large masses of skeletons continuously fell. Even Nian Bing himself hadn't expected a single Holy Light magic spell to have such wondrous use.\n\nWhen the Holy Light shone upon the cracks in the distant ground, wisps of green smoke surprisingly rose from those cracks. The cracked ground slowly closed, and no more skeleton soldiers crawled out from them.\n\nThe white halo gradually disappeared. Calm was restored within the valley. If not for the chilling aura growing even stronger, Nian Bing would probably have the illusion that nothing had happened.\n\n\"Clap, clap, clap.\" Applause suddenly sounded. Shadows seemed to rise from the flat ground, gradually appearing before Nian Bing, walking step by step towards him.\n\n\"I wondered how the Dragon Kings could set up such intricate magic arrays. So there's a human here, and a Light Mage at that. It looks like you're the one the Dragon Kings invited for help.\"\n\nNian Bing knew the main figures had arrived. A white light shone between his eyebrows. Through his Heavenly Eye acupoint, he clearly saw the figures hidden in the black mist. Walking at the very front was a person completely shrouded in a black robe; it was he who spoke. Beside him, to his left, was a slender woman with abnormally pale skin. The woman was exceedingly beautiful, but she exuded a hint of demonic aura. To his right, there was a mass of grayish-black thick mist. Seeing this thick mist, Nian Bing's heart immediately sank. He wasn't unfamiliar with such a thing. Behind these three, there were hundreds of various monsters enveloped in dark energy. They could no longer be called humans, because^ they no longer possessed human forms or human auras. It was just that Nian Bing couldn't name these dark creatures.\n\nNian Bing did not speak, continuously gathering magic elements from the air. Having just used a magic spell, he needed to recover his magic power as quickly as possible.\n\n\"So it's you, kid.\" Safin roared in anger, rushing out of the black mist first.\n\n---\n* The original Chinese idiom \"山雨欲來風滿樓\" (shānyǔyùlái fēngmǎnlóu) literally means \"wind fills the tower before the mountain rain comes,\" and is a metaphor for signs of an impending storm or significant event. It conveys a sense of tension or foreboding.\n\n^ The original text used \"軒為\" (xuān wèi), which is likely a typo for \"因為\" (yīnwèi), meaning \"because.\" This translation has adapted it to \"because\" to maintain natural English flow and intent.",

    "content": "一聽到他的聲音，念冰也認了出來，驚訝地說道：「冥王薩芬，你竟然還沒死。嗯，沒死也好。上次你沒死，不代表這次不會死。我想，聖師這一次不會再放過你了。」一邊說著，他還指了指地面上抽動著的聖耀刀。\n\n薩芬的氣息一滯。看到聖耀刀，他自靈魂深處感到一種恐懼的威脅。他哪裡知道，那散發著聖浩氣息的聖耀刀早已失去了與聖師之間的聯繫，雖然上面的神聖氣息極為濃郁，但以念冰的實力已經不足以對他構成太大的威脅了。\n\n「哦？薩芬，你們認識？」邪月淡淡地說道。\n\n薩芬恭敬地回答道：「回稟邪主，這小子就是上次跟您說險些使我形神俱滅的人類。他手上有聖師的那柄曙光刀，非常厲害。上次就是這柄刀上散發的聖焰才使我變得那麼虛弱。」他心中恨極了念冰，如果不是碰到念冰，不是這把光明神刀，他又怎麼會虛弱到被幽幽抓回去，更不會成為邪月的僕人了。對於他這樣強大的黑暗生物來說，沒有什麼比限制自由更為痛苦的事情了。如果不是邪月的話打動了他，他寧可自爆也不願意被其他黑暗生物所用。此時再見念冰，如果他有眼睛的話，恐怕早已噴出火來了。\n\n邪月掃了一眼地面上的七柄神刀，幽綠色的眼眸中流露出一絲驚訝。他沒有再前進，平靜地說道：「人類，如果你現在離開，我可以當作什麼都沒有發生過。我們的目標只是七龍王，叫他們出來。」此次行動他也沒有什麼把握，絕不願意節外生枝。\n\n念冰淡然一笑，不屑地說道：「就憑你們這些小人物也想找七龍王麼？我一個就足夠對付你們的了。不錯，外面那些魔法陣是我布置的，但那只不過是餐前的開胃菜而已。」\n\n邪月不動聲色地看著念冰，說道：「既然如此，那就別怪我不客氣了。」說著，他隨手一揮，身後頓時飛出兩道黑影，閃電般朝念冰的方向衝來。\n\n如果念冰沒有與土龍王胖子經歷三個多月的洗禮，他絕對無法應付如此快的攻擊。但是，現在已經不一樣了。對方速度再快，他也能夠通過天眼看到。那是兩個身高超過三米的巨人，粗壯的身體上散發著強烈的邪惡氣息。他們都沒有手臂，皮膚呈現出死灰色，一雙昏黃的眼睛沒有任何生命氣息。在飛衝而來的過程中，死寂的灰色氣流凝結成兩柄長刀，分別從念冰兩邊斬來。\n\n念冰沒有動，他要給對方一個高深莫測的感覺。在邪月一行人出現之時，他已經準備好了咒語。眼看著兩道黑影衝入他身前十五米處，突然，七色光芒瞬間閃亮，地上的七柄神刀消失了。七個模糊的影子交錯而過。還有什麼比能量的速度更快呢？全系影之傀儡又一次出現了。\n\n兩個冥魔前衝的身體在空中凝固，下一刻，它們已經變成了一地碎肉。風吹過，那一堆碎肉化為灰燼消失而去。\n\n邪月的眉頭皺了皺。確實，從表面上他看不出念冰的深淺。尤其念冰身前的七柄刀令他十分疑惑，每一柄刀上都散發著足夠強大的氣息。兩個冥魔雖然不是很強，但是它們的身體已經足夠堅固了。能夠瞬間秒殺兩個冥魔而使他看不出如何出手，面前的念冰已經引起了這位邪主足夠的重視。\n\n面前這個年輕的人類顯然是認識冥王薩芬的。他能守在這裡，自然也知道自己一方的強大，但是，卻依舊沒有絲毫退縮之意，很明顯並不懼怕自己等人，或者是有什麼倚仗。七龍王一個都沒有出現，難道這是一個陷阱？邪月有些猶豫了，畢竟，他對這次行動並沒有絕對的把握。\n\n念冰見對方不動，樂得等待。他要做的就是拖延時間。七個影傀儡飄然隱藏在他身後，這些可以自行吸收能量和無天之氣¹的影傀儡是不會消耗他能量的。薩芬雖然恨極了念冰，但他對聖耀刀有著很深的顧忌，一時間也不敢主動請戰，只能眼睜睜地看著念冰站在那裡不屑地看著己方。\n\n「邪主，讓我來吧。」絲娜嫵媚的聲音響起，身形飄然一閃，已經前飛出十餘里²，停在念冰身前不遠處。她上下打量著念冰，微微一笑道：「小伙子，你長得很英俊，不知道鮮血的味道如何呢？」眼中流露出一絲邪異的光芒，目光閃爍，盯視著念冰。\n\n念冰看著她的眼睛，只覺得腦海中一陣眩暈，心中暗道不好，趕忙閉上眼睛，不敢與絲娜對視。這些日子他雖然對黑暗魔法有了不少了解，但與絲娜這樣真正的黑暗世界強者相比卻差得遠了。絲娜嬌笑一聲，身形飄然前衝，眼中邪光更盛。就在她準備向念冰發動攻擊之時，突然念冰額頭上銀白色光芒爆閃，散發出無數耀眼的白光。絲娜前衝的身體嘎然而止，慘呼一聲，倒飛而回。她的妖瞳在銀白色光芒的刺激下竟然失去了威力，再也無法通過眼睛釋放出邪惡的氣息了。\n\n念冰重新睜開了眼睛，憑藉天眼，他已經看清了絲娜，淡然道：「原來是一隻蝙蝠，你的邪光對我沒什麼效果，還是免了吧。」\n\n邪月驚訝地說道：「天眼穴³開，怪不得。竟然是開了天眼穴的高手。人類，你必然是從神之大陸⁴而來的了。」\n\n念冰心中一動，既沒有承認也沒有否認，臉上依舊保持著高深莫測的微笑，平靜地站在那裡，看著面前這群邪惡的存在。\n\n絲娜眼中的嫵媚消失了，邪惡的冰冷使周圍的光線黯淡許多。她原本妖異的雙眸逐漸變成了金色。唰的一聲，一對血紅色的翅膀展開，巨大的壓力驟然而出。仿佛在絲娜的一邊，出現了一張無形的巨大魔口，隨時都有可能將念冰吞噬一般。\n\n念冰心中一驚，通過天眼穴他已經感受到了絲娜的強大，但現在他不能退，只能靜靜地看著絲娜，琢磨著對策。\n\n絲娜雙手在身前結成了一個奇異的手形，不斷用怪異的聲音低低地吟唱著什麼，一絲絲清晰可見的黑色氣息不斷地在她身前凝結著。\n\n念冰知道自己不能等了，如果任由對方凝結能量，一旦能量達到自己無法抵禦的禁咒級別，那將不會有任何機會。意念一動，光影傀儡飄然而出，聖耀刀上神聖之光大放，暖意衝到絲娜身前，輕輕的一刀劃向絲娜身前的雙手。神聖的氣息遭遇邪氣，白色的光芒顯得更加聖潔了。念冰似乎聽到了空氣中邪氣的畏懼。光影傀儡手中的聖耀刀爆發出一團強大的白光，已經到達了絲娜身前。\n\n絲娜冷冷地看著光影傀儡，她並沒有閃躲。雙手十指突然長出長達半尺的指甲，右手輕彈。一團團黑暗能量接二連三地轟擊在聖耀刀散發的刀芒上，空氣中接連產生幾次強烈的震爆，光影傀儡的身體倒飛而回。聖耀刀雖然是邪惡的克星，但念冰的實力畢竟差得太遠了。\n\n絲娜陰陰一笑，背後的紅翅展開，身形如同在水面上滑動一般，轉瞬間已經來到了念冰身前。她身形每一次變化，身體周圍的邪惡氣息就會強盛幾分。吸血鬼女王的實力又豈是易與的？七道光影閃爍，全系影之傀儡同時動了起來，七柄神刀爆發出各系凝實的光芒，光影交錯，頓時將絲娜攔了下來。影傀儡最大的優勢就是速度，但是念冰卻駭然發現，面前這個女吸血鬼的速度竟然不比自己的影傀儡差。尤其是在影傀儡攻擊她時，她總能未卜先知一般地輕鬆閃躲，嬌軀不斷地扭曲擺動著，就像一縷煙霧般不斷在七個影傀儡之間穿梭著。黑色的氣流一次又一次地將七影傀儡的身體彈飛，避開七柄神刀最鋒銳的一面，逐漸接近著念冰。\n\n念冰已經站在那裡，沒有[移動]。\n凝視著距離自己越來越近的絲[娜]，\n感受著她那越來越強的邪惡氣[息]，\n他心中苦[澀]。\n加拉曼迪，\n你們可要快一些啊！\n\n絲娜剛開始向念冰動手時，心中也有些猶[豫]。\n畢竟念冰看上去深不可測的實力令她心中無[法輕視]。\n但，\n當她擊退光影傀儡之時，心中不禁放鬆了許[多]。\n連對黑暗最有效的神聖光刃⁵都沒有爆發出足以逼退自己的力[量]。\n看來，\n面前這個人類並不如何可[怕]。\n他依靠的只是那七柄刀而已。\n\n七個影傀儡的速度確實給絲娜造成了不小的麻煩。畢竟，這是念冰精心研究出來的，當初連防禦力強的土龍王胖子都曾吃過虧。但是，絲娜的速度加上蝙蝠先天的本能，她的閃避技巧卻遠不是土龍王胖子可以比擬的。為了保留更多的實力對付七龍王，絲娜並沒有使用自己最強的能力，僅憑藉吸血鬼女王強橫的身體和過人的速度接近著念冰。在她心中想來，只要能將念冰毀滅掉就足夠了。\n\n全系影之傀儡在絲娜的逼迫下逐漸後退，距離念冰的身體越來越近了。它們本身的能量也因為施展趕不上凝聚的速度而逐漸削弱著。念冰不急，他還是沒有動。他在等待著最好的機會。給對方的驚詫只能有一回，而這唯一的機會如果不能重創對方，那麼自己就再沒有任何機會。\n\n終於，絲娜已經進入了念冰身前九米範圍，強橫的邪惡氣息不斷地向念冰這個方向涌動著。澎湃的邪力刺激著念冰的肌膚一陣冰冷，但是，他已經不再是一名普通的魔法師，身體改造後，再加上本身就擁有黑暗的能量，這種刺激還不足以對他構成威脅。\n\n九米距離很快就變成了六米，再從六米變到了一丈（約三米）。在邪惡氣息的逼迫下，念冰已經關閉了自己的外呼吸，完全憑藉先天之氣維持著。\n\n絲娜身形接連七閃，黑暗魔力驟然迸發，將七個影之傀儡同時迫退。身體呈弧線般飄然一閃，那帶有長長指甲的右手已經探到了念冰的面門之前。就在這時候，一圈七彩光澤暈以念冰為中心瞬間爆發了。絲娜原本輕盈的身體突然一沉，她駭然發現，自己的黑暗能量竟然飛快地削弱著，身體如同凝固了一般，被一層粘稠的能量包裹住。就在這個時候，七個影傀儡同時殺了回來，七影傀儡在天眼領域的增幅下頓時提升到最強狀態。七柄魔法刀充滿了澎湃的能量，速度驟然提升一倍，而絲娜在震驚之中速度已經大大的減弱了。這就是念冰留給她的絕殺。\n\n但是，絲娜畢竟是生存了上千年的邪惡生物，實戰方面的經驗實在太豐富了。在危機關頭，她再也顧不得保存實力，體內的黑暗邪力驟然迸發。那雙紅色的翅膀仿佛要滴出血來一般，一層紅色的血霧噴薄而出，竟然想以強橫的能量直接將念冰困住，她的先天領域完全撐開。\n\n血氣異常霸道，不但使天眼領域的作用減弱到不到一半，同時，也如同一層堅實的屏障阻擋住了影傀儡的攻擊。但是，她的屏障阻擋住了包括光影傀儡在內的六個傀儡，那道黑色的身影竟然無視血氣的存在飄然而入，閃電般的一刀，重重地斬上了絲娜護住身體的翅膀。\n\n「啊——」劇烈的疼痛中，黑暗氣息竟然順著傷口狂泄而出，仿佛要將絲娜的身體抽乾一般。吸血鬼女王強橫的身體瞬間收縮，原本的金色瞳孔頓時恢復了常態。驚恐使她那張動人的俏臉變得有些扭曲了。她不知道發生了什麼事，但她體內修煉了上千年的黑暗能量竟然被不斷地吸收著。背後那一刀，仿佛是無底深淵一般，正吞噬著她的身體。\n\n---\n¹ `無天之氣 (Wu Tian Qi)`: A specific type of energy in the story.\n² `里 (li)`: A traditional Chinese unit of distance, approximately 500 meters.\n³ `天眼穴 (Heavenly Eye Acupoint)`: Refers to a mystical point, often associated with spiritual or enhanced vision/perception.

    "content": "Xie Yue and Si Na were husband and wife, after all, and Si Na's situation immediately caught his attention. His body, completely enveloped in a black robe, floated up. A dozen or so eerie green rays of light shot out like lightning, and in the blink of an eye, they had entered Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye Domain. Xie Yue's actions naturally drew Nian Bing's attention. However, when those dozen or so green lights entered his domain, Nian Bing discovered that they did not belong to any elemental system; besides delaying their attack, he could not weaken these energies. Just then, the Dark Shadow Puppet moved on its own. The blade energy that had originally struck Si Na's back floated up. A black flame seemed to burn on the slender blade, its extreme speed turning it into a blur. With more than ten consecutive flashes, it actually blocked all dozen or so green lights. As soon as each green light touched the black flame, it was instantly burned away. Although the Heavenly Eye Domain was somewhat affected, it was not seriously harmed.\n\nSeizing this opportunity, Si Na spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. The blood mist erupted with full force, blocking the six shadows that attacked again, and issuing a mournful howl. Under the protection of the blood energy, she forcefully broke out of the Heavenly Eye Domain's encirclement. With one flash, she was back beside the Evil Lord. It wasn't that she didn't want to seize the chance to kill Nian Bing. However, the closer the Heavenly Eye Domain was to Nian Bing's body, the stronger its intensity became. To survive, she truly dared not take the slightest risk. Everything became silent again. Si Na, weakened, half-knelt on the ground, gasping for breath constantly. Her dark energy had been severely depleted. Not only her external energy, but even her most precious soul power had been absorbed by that blade. She didn't understand what had happened, but as a dark creature, her heart was filled with fear at this moment.\n\nAs Si Na retreated, Nian Bing immediately retracted his Heavenly Eye Domain. Not only did Si Na not understand what had happened earlier, but Nian Bing himself didn't either. Earlier, when Si Na unleashed her blood energy, his heart sank. Through observation with the Heavenly Eye Domain, he clearly felt that the blood energy was no longer purely a dark aura. And his Seven Shadow Puppets were not yet fully perfected, making it impossible to break such a strong defense. Just as he was preparing to react, the scene of the Dark Shadow Puppet heavily injuring Si Na occurred. Not only that, but the Dark Shadow Puppet also automatically helped him block Xie Yue's incoming attack. Nian Bing had a feeling that if Xie Yue hadn't intervened, that one strike from the Dark Shadow Puppet would have completely drained the energy of Si Na, the Vampire Queen. He didn't know where this feeling came from, but it was so real.\n\nThe Seven Shadow Puppets were neatly arranged in front of Nian Bing. Utilizing this brief time, they rapidly absorbed innate energy from the air to replenish themselves. Of course, this did not include the Dark Shadow Puppet. The Dark Shadow Puppet's body appeared much more solid than before. Although it was still a transparent energy form, within its energy body, black mist seemed to swirl. It was clear that it was much more powerful than the other shadow puppets. Seeing all this, Nian Bing remembered the name of the blade in the Dark Shadow Puppet's hand: Demon-Devouring Blade. Could it devour the aura of all demons?\n\nThe seven divine blades—each had its own characteristics, each was filled with an extraordinarily powerful aura, and each had its own uniqueness. Up until now, Nian Bing still hadn't figured out how powerful the energy truly hidden within these divine blades was. However, the Dark Shadow Puppet's sudden burst of power made him vaguely sense something. Of course, what he sensed was not clear.\n\nXie Yue's cold voice rang out, \"Sa Fen, you should recognize this blade, shouldn't you? Unbelievable. It's actually still in the human world, and didn't go with its master. Truly unexpected!\"\n\nSa Fen's voice trembled slightly. \"Yes, it is... the Curse of Eternal Hell—the Demon-Devouring Blade. How is this possible? How could the Black Martial Emperor's Demon-Devouring Blade be in this kid's hands? And, this blade seems to have changed. It's become even more powerful than before; it didn't seem to have these abilities back then! Lord Evil Lord, I truly don't know why this is happening. After the Black Martial Emperor and I were sealed together, I lost contact with him. You also know that the main target of the Divine Seal was the Black Martial Emperor; he alone bore nearly seventy percent of the Divine Seal. How could he possibly survive? It's just, this blade...\"\n\nXie Yue raised his hand, stopping Sa Fen from speaking further. Slowly, step by step, he walked towards Nian Bing. As he walked, he said calmly, \"Human, although your strength exceeds my expectations, you know, I also saw many things in your battle with Si Na. At least, I can confirm you are not from the Continent of Gods. Even if you have opened your Heavenly Eye Acupoint, it is just that, merely opened. I must admit, you are a genius, and your psychological fortitude is excellent. What a pity, what a pity, your strength is still not enough to contend with us. If you didn't have those seven blades in your hand, Sa Fen could easily kill you. From your appearance, you are just a human Archmage. Although your magic is very strange, and you have an odd Innate Domain, your only outcome is death. I think you must have some connection with the Seven Dragon Kings. If you are their friend, and they let you guard this place alone, then the Seven Dragon Kings might be in some trouble. I never would have thought! Truly unexpected, that I would bring people here today on an adventure and actually seize such a good opportunity. Human, I admire your magic, and you possess the Black Martial Emperor's Demon-Devouring Blade. If you are willing to submit to me, then not only can I spare your life, but I will also teach you powerful dark magic, making you the strongest among humans. Perhaps you are stalling for time, but you no longer have the chance.\"\n\nHearing Xie Yue's words, Nian Bing's heart sank to the bottom. He knew it wasn't due to any carelessness on his part; the main problem lay with his own strength. This fellow in front of him, called the Evil Lord, must be the leader of these dark beings, or the Lich that Galamandis spoke of. Based on his experience, the flaws in his battle with Si Na had already been seen through. His own strength was still insufficient after all! However, Xie Yue still overestimated him somewhat; in truth, he had not yet reached the strength of an Archmage. If not for the Demon-Devouring Blade's sudden burst of power just now, he might have already been torn to shreds by Si Na. Submission could buy him life, but would he? No, absolutely not. The arrogance deep in his bones filled Nian Bing's mind and body. Turning his head, he took a deep look at the cave behind him. He secretly prayed in his heart, \"Galamandis, I hope my sacrifice can buy you enough time. You must strive harder.\"\n\nAt this very moment, Nian Bing was suddenly surprised to find that there was no longer any hatred in his heart, nothing at all. His mind was completely filled with the persistence in his heart. He wasn't thinking about himself. He only wanted to stop Xie Yue and his group. He only wanted to prevent these enemies from encroaching upon the Seven Dragon Kings. This persistence caused Nian Bing's mind and his own magical power to perfectly merge. His Heavenly Eye became clearer than before. Seven-colored flames slowly burned around his body. In the air, one could almost hear the cheers of the magic elements. Nian Bing calmly looked at the Evil Lord in front of him, and said indifferently: \"I never considered myself a good person, nor a righteous gentleman, but I understand one principle: Thirsty, one does not drink from a Thief's Spring. Hot, one does not rest in the shade of an evil tree.* You want to harm my friends? You can, but the precondition is that you step over my corpse. You're right, you few are much stronger than me, but strength doesn't mean everything.\"\n\nSi Na had recovered somewhat by this time. Straightening her body again, her beautiful face became even paler. \"Good, what a persistent human. If I sucked your blood, I could at least recover seventy percent. Lord Evil Lord, quickly kill him, don't hesitate any longer.\" No one was more familiar with Xie Yue than her. Through Xie Yue's words just now, she knew Xie Yue had developed a desire to cherish talent. Otherwise, he wouldn't have bothered wasting so many words on Nian Bing at such a tense moment. The Demon-Devouring Blade had devoured more than half of Si Na's abilities; she utterly hated, utterly hated this human in front of her.\n\nXie Yue frowned slightly. The eerie green light in his eyes intensified somewhat. \"Human, do you still not realize? I'll give you one last chance.\"\n\nA hint of mockery appeared on Nian Bing's face. \"Don't call me by those two words, 'human'. My surname is Rong, and my name is Rong Nian Bing. Remember my name; I think I'll leave a deeper impression on you.\"\n\nThe Evil Lord smiled indifferently and said, \"Since that's the case, I can only destroy you.\" His figure floated up, without any external force. Eerie green light surrounded his body. Nian Bing was suddenly surprised to find that everything around him had completely turned an eerie green. The magic elements in the air were actually being gradually drawn away, making it impossible for him to absorb them to replenish himself. Subconsciously, he controlled the Dark Shadow Puppet to block in front of him. At the same time, he released his Heavenly Eye Domain. The storm was coming, and Nian Bing didn't know how long he could last.\n\n\"Rong Nian Bing, do you still not realize? Don't even mention that you only wield the Demon-Devouring Blade; even if Qu were to resurrect, he might not be able to defeat me.\" A ball of eerie green flame appeared like lightning in front of Nian Bing. There was no aura whatsoever in the flame, nor any fire elements. It seemed to be a pure flame, yet it contained no trace of purity.\n\nHis Heavenly Eye lit up, and Nian Bing finally understood what kind of flame this was. This eerie green fire was the burning of evil thoughts. In this flame, he could even sense the aura of a soul. Of course, it wasn't the Evil Lord's soul, but a dead spirit, a dead spirit whose death date was unknown. Just then, the eerie green flame suddenly rippled slightly, transforming into a flame arrow, which in a blink of an eye shot into the Heavenly Eye Domain. The flame arrow's speed was extremely fast; although it slowed somewhat under the influence of the Heavenly Eye Domain, it reached the Dark Shadow Puppet in an instant.\n\nA flash of light from the Demon-Devouring Blade in the Dark Shadow Puppet's hand, and the eerie green flame arrow vanished. And the Dark Shadow Puppet's own energy seemed to have increased. Xie Yue praised, \"Good, truly worthy of the Demon-Devouring Blade. It seems my conjecture was correct. The Demon-Devouring Blade's energy has been activated by some method you used; it can absorb all auras from darkness and evil. Indeed, it is a top-tier dark divine artifact! However, a divine artifact alone isn't enough; it also depends on the wielder's strength.\" As he spoke, a bell appeared in his hand, a black bell, palm-sized. It emitted a faint 'ding' sound. The sound was very soft, but to Nian Bing's ears, it was like the roar of a giant bell. He subconsciously took a step back, nearly stumbling to the ground. The seven shadow puppets in front of him simultaneously dimmed somewhat. Only the light of the seven divine blades remained strong. The sudden change greatly alarmed Nian Bing; he had no idea what had happened.\n\nXie Yue smiled faintly and said, \"I don't want to waste too much of my magic power on you, so I'll send you off with this Soul-Snatching Bell, which is also a dark divine artifact. The Soul-Snatching Bell has seven sounds, the first being the Tremor Sound.\" As he spoke, he lightly shook the bell in his hand. Immediately, a bell sound much stronger than before suddenly rang out. Nian Bing instantly felt his mind go blank. His Heavenly Eye Acupoint sealed itself, and the magic power within him seemed to be trapped by something. The Heavenly Eye Domain actually slipped from his control and vanished automatically. When he regained consciousness, he found that only the seven shadow puppets remained in front of him. However, apart from the Dark Shadow Puppet, the light of the other shadow puppets had dimmed to near invisibility. A hint of bitterness appeared on Nian Bing's face; the Evil Lord was actually much more terrifying than he had imagined. That was just one sound of the bell!\n\nXie Yue smiled indifferently and said, \"It seems I still overestimated you. You can't even withstand one Tremor Sound. Now you should understand that even top-tier divine artifacts depend on who wields them. The second sound of my Soul-Snatching Bell is the Sound of Annihilation. If you can withstand it, I will temporarily spare your life.\" Saying that, he raised the Soul-Snatching Bell in his hand once more.\n\nNian Bing braced himself and stood up from the ground. With a wave of his left hand, he simultaneously retracted his seven magic blades. He also dispersed the energy of the seven shadow puppets. The energy of all the elemental shadow puppets simultaneously flowed back into him. This allowed his spirit to recover somewhat, and he re-established contact with his magic power. However, the Demon-Devouring Blade did not provide him with more energy; it seemed that all the evil aura it had absorbed earlier was absorbed by the blade itself.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" Nian Bing suddenly spoke. Spreading his hands, he indicated that he had given up resistance. \"You shattered my Innate Domain with just one sound. I admit I am not your opponent.\"\n\nXie Yue looked at Nian Bing with interest, and said, \"So, you intend to surrender to me?\" The reason he admired Nian Bing was because Nian Bing possessed talent that neither Sa Fen nor Si Na could compare to. If applied properly, this talent could completely transform Nian Bing into another version of himself. Although Sa Fen was powerful, he was ultimately just a Nether Lich. The biggest difference between a Nether Lich and a Lich was the lack of a body. While being bodiless certainly meant not fearing physical attacks, without a body, one naturally would not possess acupoints.\n\n---\n*   _Thirsty, one does not drink from a Thief's Spring.

    "content": "Xie Yue had currently opened three apertures, and he naturally knew that an empty aperture had an absolute effect on any +++, and he also understood that the Celestial Eye Aperture was the Spirit Aperture among the Seven Apertures. Nian Bing opening the Celestial Eye Aperture meant his future potential was limitless. If he could control Nian Bing, it would greatly benefit Xie Yue in his future mastery of the elusive Forgotten Kingdom. Therefore, he had never made a killing move against Nian Bing, hoping to make him pledge allegiance.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"It's not impossible for me to submit to you. After all, I also hope to become stronger. Perhaps you've already sensed that I don't cultivate just one type of magic. Sometimes, even I don't understand what level my magic has reached, what its characteristics are, or what kind of power it can unleash. I wonder what your understanding of seven-elemental magic is? If I were to submit to you, the primary condition would be for you to help me. Currently, while I feel you are very powerful, our cultivation methods are not the same. If I submit to you, how can you help me improve my strength? In my opinion, although you cultivate as a Lich, you are fundamentally still a human. You can't possibly be proficient in other abilities simultaneously, can you?\"\n\nXie Yue smiled faintly and said, \"There's nothing impossible about that. You must understand, thousands of years ago, I was also a human mage. I originally didn't cultivate my current magic; instead, like you, I practiced ordinary human magic. Later, I discovered the power of necromancy and the ability to live forever, so I switched to my current magic. I am a Lich, that's true, but I didn't develop from a Dark Mage. Necromancy is my foundation, a base built over thousands of years. Regardless of the type of magic, I have detailed information on it in my mind. As long as you are willing to submit to me, under my guidance, you will definitely make great progress. With the Celestial Eye Aperture, you can even learn my necromancy. Human life is limited, but if you cultivate necromancy with me, you can become immortal. I imagine everyone wishes to live for a long time, don't they?\"\n\nNian Bing fell into deep thought, hesitating for a long while before saying, \"Immortality indeed holds great appeal for me. It seems submitting to you isn't a bad choice. I have one more condition.\"\n\n\"Bastard! Lord Xie is willing to accept your submission and teach you the method of eternal life; that is already a great favor! How dare you still demand conditions?\" Sina said resentfully.\n\nXie Yue raised his hand, stopping Sina from speaking further, and said to Nian Bing, \"Alright, tell me. In this world, there isn't much I can't do.\"\n\nNian Bing's face showed a look of hatred. \"I have a great revenge yet to be exacted. She killed my parents. If you can promise to help me kill her, I will submit to you. However, my enemy is no ordinary person. She is the only Divine Descender on the continent right now, the Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess. Can you do it?\"\n\nXie Yue smiled calmly, saying, \"Perhaps, in the eyes of others, the Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess is a powerful existence, but in my eyes, she is merely a human mage. Very well, I promise you.\" Seeing the genuine hatred in Nian Bing's eyes, he finally gained a bit more trust in Nian Bing. After all, as a strong individual dwelling in darkness, he clearly understood the characteristics of humans: as long as negative aura exists within them, their spirit is not unbreakable. The hatred on Nian Bing's face was genuine; it was hatred from the depths of his heart. He could clearly feel the strong hatred in Nian Bing's soul.\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath and said, \"Good, in that case, I agree to submit to you. However, I imagine that submitting to you isn't so simple, is it? You will always demand something of me.\"\n\nXie Yue smiled, \"Of course. If you want to gain my trust, I have a curse that I need you to complete. As long as you complete this curse, then from now on, you will be my person. However, there's no rush for that. To show your loyalty, first clear the cave entrance and tell me what happened to the Seven Dragon Kings. As for the curse, we can discuss it after things here are concluded.\"\n\nNian Bing said with some surprise, \"A curse? Lord Xie, I once heard someone mention an incomplete curse incantation; it seemed very mysterious. Could you explain it to me?\"\n\nXie Yue frowned slightly. He was growing a bit impatient, but he still nodded and said, \"Alright, speak. When it comes to the art of cursing, probably no one on this continent is more familiar with it than I am.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"The incantation for this curse is as follows,\" At this point, his gaze became somewhat distant, and in a low, magnetic voice, with a specific cadence, he slowly chanted: \"At the cost of my life, I curse all living beings. At the cost of my soul, I curse all elements. With my fresh blood as guidance, with my soul as melody, I am willing to offer my life essence, in exchange for endless power between heaven and earth. Destruction is my hope. I am willing to cast this curse upon myself, in exchange for the hope of destruction. Oh, most mysterious curse in the world! I am willing to dedicate myself to you. With the power of the curse as the source, be released, my life. Sigh of the Life Curse.\"\n\nFrom the moment Nian Bing began chanting the first line of the incantation, Xie Yue listened intently. This incantation felt both familiar and strange to him. He frequently used cursing arts, yet he had never used such an incantation. He didn't want to show weakness in front of Nian Bing, so he carefully recalled the complex incantations in his mind, hoping to find the function of this spell. However, when he heard the line, \"I am willing to dedicate myself to you,\" Xie Yue's entire body trembled. He looked at Nian Bing in horror and cried out, \"Quick, stop! This is not an incomplete incantation!\" But it was already too late; the incantation was complete.\n\nNian Bing smiled, all trace of his former humility completely gone. He calmly looked at Xie Yue and said, \"Of course, I knew this wasn't an incomplete incantation, but if I didn't say that, how could I complete this spell? Lord Xie, I wonder if the power I gain by cursing my own life for everyone can contend with you?\" Rings of white light continuously emanated from Nian Bing's body. That was not a holy aura, nor did it represent light. At this moment, his body seemed to have transformed into magical elements. Amidst the shimmering white light, Nian Bing's muscles slightly expanded, and a magic blade reappeared. This time, however, they radiated a strong light that seemed capable of piercing through everything.\n\nFrom the very beginning of his conversation with Xie Yue, stalling for time, he had already decided to use this Life Curse. Nian Bing was surprised to find that, at this moment, he seemed to have forgotten the fear of death. The thought that his released life might bring about the birth of a new Dragon King made his heart even calmer. He had deeply experienced the pain of losing his parents. If Xie Yue and his people entered the cave, not only would the Little Dragon King lose its parents, but Nian Bing himself would also not be able to protect them. Galamandis's help to him, Earth Dragon King Fatty's help to him—he remembered every single bit clearly. Their help to him was given without expecting any return, but they were his friends! Now, even if he didn't use the Life Curse, Lord Xie probably wouldn't let him go, and the Seven Dragon Kings would still be destroyed. Nian Bing always valued benefits. Since he wouldn't have a good outcome regardless, why not fight to the death? At least, if he won, his friends could live. He didn't think he was great; he just felt that this was what he, as a man, a truly upright man, should do. His wisdom was applied at this moment: first, he dispelled some of Lord Xie's doubts by using his genuine hatred to lower his suspicion, and finally, he used the method of inquiry to unleash the Life Curse. Everything happened so naturally.\n\nPower! Nian Bing felt an incredibly strong power. The seven magic light spheres within his body suddenly swelled to twice their size. As his life aura was released, his power grew stronger and stronger. With his body as the center, magical elements were clearly visible. Seven-colored light points actually broke through the gloomy green barrier and continuously condensed towards Nian Bing's body. The energy gained from releasing his life essence was much stronger than anticipated. A cold light flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. The All-Elemental Shadow Puppet appeared once again, but this time he didn't even use an incantation; with just a thought, seven corporeal figures appeared. Simultaneously, the Celestial Eye Domain instantly spread outwards, quickly surpassing its original five-zhang limit. The entire valley seemed to be filled with the Celestial Eye Domain, and even Xie Yue's figure was affected. The vast seven-colored light, while condensing, broke through the gloomy green obstruction, bringing light back to the valley. Another beginning, one at the cost of life force, had appeared.\n\nXie Yue coldly watched Nian Bing. \"Are you mad? Don't you understand that using the Life Curse will exhaust your life force, and even your soul will perish with it?\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"You and I have different philosophies. I will never submit to anyone. In this cave are my friends, and to protect them, I would rather fight to the death.\"\n\nXie Yue laughed, \"Good, I didn't expect such an anomaly among humans like you. However, you are wrong about one thing. Even if you use the Life Curse, you cannot defeat me. I am a Lich, the strongest in the Dark Domain. I will show you what true powerful dark energy is.\" As he spoke, he tore off the veil on his face, revealing a handsome yet demonic appearance. His gloomy green eyes gradually turned blood-red. Lightly shaking the Soul-Snatching Bell in his hand, he roared, \"Sever!\" In an instant, under the effect of the strange bell sound, the Celestial Eye Domain that restricted him was immediately forced back several zhang. A layer of red light enveloped his subordinates, including Safin and Sina, sending them all a hundred zhang away with this immense energy. Xie Yue was enraged by Nian Bing's actions. He wanted to use his power to utterly destroy this human who dared to offend him. The eerie energy caused a blood-red sun to appear behind him; it was the Supreme Evil Blood Sun, representing the Lich's power.\n\nNian Bing remained standing in place, unaffected by the Soul-Snatching Bell. \"Lord Xie, if I'm not mistaken, the primary effect of your Dark Divine Artifact is to influence the opponent's mental power and will. I am willing to sacrifice my life to protect my friends; at least at this moment, my will is perfect and flawless. Therefore, your Soul-Snatching Bell can no longer play a decisive role. I will also show you my true power. In fact, saying I am an all-elemental magic user is inaccurate. My all-elemental magic comes from the Dragons' mimicry magic. The true me is an Ice-Fire Dual-Origin Mage.\"\n\nThe Ice and Fire Shadow Puppets disappeared simultaneously. The Morning Dew Blade, the Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess, and the Righteous Sun Blade, the Roar of the God of Flame, were held by Nian Bing in his respective hands. Having used the Life Curse taught to him by Long Zhi, he finally profoundly understood what the limits of ice and fire were, what true ice-fire dual origin was. Although it might be late, Nian Bing, having discarded all distracting thoughts, decided to use the most magnificent magic to bring a perfect conclusion to his life. In his mind, the incantation, which he had clearly memorized countless times but never used, flashed into his awareness. Nian Bing smiled. Since he had to face the consequences of the Life Curse, why not be more composed? \"Ice and snow, dwelling in the coldest places between heaven and earth, I wish to borrow your purest energy, to transform into the cold valley's glaciers, to transform into the divine power of the Ice and Snow Goddess! Condense into Ice of Solitude and Pride, condense into Ice of Extreme Cold, condense into Ice of Purity, condense into Ice of Solidity! Guided by the divine power of the Ice and Snow Goddess, condense into a perfect body, materialize endless divine power, manifest in the strongest form of life! Forbidden: Ice and Snow Goddess Dragon Transformation Technique!\" The Morning Dew Blade flew from his hand. The Ice and Snow Goddess Stone on its hilt transformed into an eye, a giant blue eye. Pure ice elements were closely linked. Amidst the cold aura, the body of ice gradually took shape. It was a giant dragon, a dragon whose body was three-tenths larger than that of a true Dragon King. Its appearance brought endless severe cold to the valley. All plants withered in the cold, and the temperature dropped sharply. The Ice and Snow Goddess Dragon roared to the sky, letting out an ear-splitting dragon roar. This was a dragon, a dragon based on ice. Under the influence of the Ice and Snow Goddess Stone as its origin, this eleventh-tier magic was successfully completed. The Ice and Snow Goddess Dragon, a forbidden spell, was a powerful forbidden spell in ice-elemental magic, second only to the Divine Descent Technique. At least as long as the magic was maintained, the power of this gigantic Ice and Snow Goddess Dragon was definitely not inferior to Ice Dragon King Sasariss.",

    "content": "Spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood, Nianbing’s body swayed slightly. Although the Life Curse summoned the most potent magic, it still placed an immense burden on his body. At this moment, Nianbing recalled the words of the Fire Dragon King Galmandy: to become the most powerful magician, one must have a body capable of enduring the impact of immense magical power. He hoped his body could hold out.\n\nEvil Moon’s expression subtly changed. He sternly ordered his subordinates, “You all, leave this valley immediately. Come back after I’ve dealt with him. Dragon of the Ice Goddess? Hmph.” Putting away his Soul-Snatching Bell, a blood-red magic staff, crystalline throughout, appeared in Evil Moon’s hand. This staff resembled a thick, elongated bone, a few inches longer than Evil Moon’s body. At the very tip of the bone was an opaque black gem, emanating layers of bloody aura. The blood-red sun behind him lit up. Evil Moon chanted his spell in a strange voice. As he chanted the first note, everything behind him was enveloped by blood-red light, as if the sky itself had turned red.\n\nEvil Moon’s spell was in a special language Nianbing didn’t understand. Nor did he concern himself with what magic Evil Moon was using. After the Forbidden Spell, ‘Dragon of the Ice Goddess,’ was complete, he didn’t immediately activate it. Taking a deep breath, he concentrated all his magical power. Even his five shadow puppets dissolved completely. Putting away his other five magic blades, he slowly chanted, holding high the Roar of the Fire God in his hand: “Heavenly Fire residing in the most scorching places of heaven and earth, I shall borrow your purest energy, transforming it into endless molten lava, condensing the divine power of the Fire God, solidifying into Blazing Fire, solidifying into Passion Fire, solidifying into Phoenix Nirvana Fire, solidifying into Hellfire. Guided by the Fire God’s divine power, solidify into a perfect form, manifesting endless divine power, appear as the strongest form of life! Forbidden Spell, Fire God Dragon Transformation Art!” The red light gradually turned purple. Yes, this was the ultimate Heavenly Fire. Prince Rong once used Heavenly Fire to form a lion. That was a forbidden spell close to the eleventh rank. The dragon is the strongest creature in the world. This Fire God Dragon Transformation Art is the true forbidden spell, just like the Ice Goddess Dragon Transformation Art, only a hair’s breadth away from a God-Descent Art.\n\nA colossal purple Dragon of the Fire God appeared, bringing an aura diametrically opposed to that of the pure Dragon of the Ice Goddess. The entire valley was divided into three sections: Evil Moon’s vast blood-red evil power, the ultimate cold white divine power of ice, and the ultimate hot purple divine power of fire. The three colors looked surprisingly harmonious. Yet, amidst these extreme energies, all vegetation in the valley had already turned to ashes.\n\nSpitting out another mouthful of blood, a hint of relief appeared on Nianbing’s face. His originally golden hair now had a few strands of gray-white. The full release of his life force had brought him to the brink of utter exhaustion. However, he had, after all, completed them—these two powerful forbidden spells that defied creation. His voice carried a hint of weariness, “Go, Dragon of the Ice Goddess, Dragon of the Fire God, destroy all evil!”\n\nTwo long, profound, and resonant dragon roars shook the entire Cold Ridge. The colossal dragon bodies flapped their wings and soared high, simultaneously spewing white and purple dragon breaths towards Evil Moon.\n\nEvil Moon’s spell was also complete at this moment, bathed in the blood-red sky behind him. Floating in mid-air, he resembled a devil god. Blood-red light, condensed from countless evil power, gathered into a colossal red orb, appearing before him. Evil Moon bellowed in his cold voice, “…Demon…Devour God.” The red orb slowly flew out, but with every inch it advanced, its range significantly expanded. The completely different breaths of ice and fire converged in the air, surprisingly coalescing into one stream. Spiraling and intertwining, they slammed into this blood-sun-like red orb.\n\nNianbing screamed at the top of his lungs, “Ice and Fire, One Origin! Twin Dragons, Unite! Sigh of the Ice Goddess, Roar of the Fire God, unleash your strongest power!” At this moment, the light on both the Morning Dew Blade and the Sun’s Zenith Blade simultaneously dimmed to their lowest. The bodies of the two divine dragons completely shrank, following their entwined breaths. Their colossal dragon forms coiled in the air, charging unyieldingly towards the blood-red sky.\n\nThe Dragon of the Ice Goddess and the Dragon of the Fire God, flying in mid-air, suddenly mutated. Their intertwined bodies surprisingly merged amidst the distortion. Immediately after, their dragon bodies vanished mid-flight. Circle after circle of surging purple and white energy, during their fusion, astonishingly formed a gigantic hexagram over thirty meters in diameter. The light around the hexagram was completely distorted, and streaks of lightning-like ripples flickered around it.\n\nA faint smile appeared on Nianbing’s somewhat weathered face. He knew he had succeeded. This was no longer just two eleventh-rank forbidden spells. Manifesting as ‘Ice and Fire, One Origin,’ even Nianbing himself couldn’t estimate what level they had reached. The colossal hexagram drifted gracefully towards the seemingly distant blood-red sky. Evil Moon’s blood-colored orb was directly swallowed by the hexagram, and destructive energy erupted in the air.\n\nThe light suddenly condensed, the strange light instantly forming a single point. The next moment, a colossal explosion occurred.\n\nThe power of forbidden spells was undoubtedly terrifying, but it paled significantly in comparison to a God-Descent Art. Undoubtedly, as one of history’s strongest liches, Evil Moon’s power had even surpassed the realm of God-Descenders. Similarly, by sacrificing his life force, Nianbing had gambled with his own life to fuse the two forbidden spells, unleashed in the form of ‘Ice and Fire, One Origin,’ to obtain the strongest power. Yes, he succeeded. Although the purple-white hexagram, like something from hell, didn’t belong to any specific God-Descent Art, the power it displayed in its final moments had reached the level of a God-Descent Art.\n\nRed, purple, and white light completely mixed together—they were the explosion of a God-Descent Art. Evil Moon floated nearly three hundred meters high in the sky. The moment the energy erupted, the blood-red light around his body instantly dimmed. A hint of terror appeared on his evil countenance. The next moment, he violently spewed a mouthful of blood, condensing a strange symbol in front of him, and his entire body instantly vanished. Of course, merely leaving his original position didn’t mean he had escaped the God-Descent Art’s attack. The immense energy, having reached such a level, had firmly locked onto his aura.\n\nPurple-black currents swept out from a height of three hundred meters in the air. The energy spread instantly. Wherever it passed, there was no violent explosion, nor the colossal momentum of mountains collapsing and earth rending. However, anything that came into contact with these purple-black currents instantly turned to dust and vanished.\n\nThe chaotic energy lasted for the duration of a meal—then something terrifying happened. The entire vast Cold Ridge, in a short period, surprisingly had no magical elements present. Centered on the energy explosion, all mountains within nearly one-third of the Cold Ridge’s area were leveled from a height of three hundred meters, as if those mountains were always meant to be that way. What followed was an energy storm that lasted for nearly a month. In this energy storm, let alone sensing magical elements for cultivation, mere survival became extremely difficult. And all of this was caused by that peerless clash.\n\nThe reason forbidden spells were called forbidden spells was precisely because the destructive power they generated was too immense—a power that should not belong to the mortal realm. Fortunately, this was in the Cold Ridge; otherwise, the unleashed power could have easily razed a large city.\n\nThe Priestess of the Ice Goddess felt the collision of God-Descender level. Prince Rong, who had just returned to the capital from his campaign, also felt it. Both were astonished, speculating on the source of this energy, yet neither could figure out who the combatants were. At the same time, the Seven Dragon Kings deep within the cave also felt it. They were the closest. The moment the energy exploded, if the Seven Dragon Kings hadn’t possessed exceptionally formidable strength, they would have long since gone berserk due to the energy blast.\n\nThey couldn’t see anything outside, but they could clearly feel what was happening. Every single action Nianbing took was clearly presented in their minds. The Seven Dragon Kings’ eyes moistened. However, at this moment, they couldn’t go to Nianbing’s aid. Even abandoning the dragon egg before them had become impossible. The strange energy on the dragon egg was actually pulling at their own energy, like a huge void, constantly absorbing the Seven Dragon Kings’ energy to replenish itself. Should any one Dragon King abruptly withdraw their power, they would immediately be struck by the combined energy of the other six Dragon Kings. Thus, they couldn’t move; doing so would be tantamount to suicide. The mighty Seven Dragon Kings had never imagined that one day they would survive under the life-sacrificing protection of a human. Galmandy closed his eyes, Fatty closed his eyes. Among the Seven Dragon Kings, even Kaodilis, the Space Dragon King, known for his cold and aloof nature, couldn’t help but shed tears. They could imagine Nianbing’s fate, having burned his life force to such an extent. They didn’t know if the enemy had retreated, but they no longer wanted to think about it. Nianbing—that name was now deeply etched in the hearts of the Seven Dragon Kings.\n\nOn the surface, everything returned to calm. Was Nianbing dead? No, not yet.\n\nThe coldness of the ground and the scent of earth were so real. Nianbing suddenly found that lying on the ground felt very real. The magic just now had almost exhausted his life force. The reason he was still alive was not because of how strong his life force was, but because of the Heavenly Radiance Plaque that Yu Ruyan had given him, which rested on his chest. A gentle current protected his internal organs, preserving his last spark of life. Although Nianbing could no longer sense his Heavenly Eye Acupoint, nor a trace of magical aura within his body, he was indeed still alive.\n\nNianbing thought of Yu Ruyan, and thought of Feng Nu. He secretly prayed in his heart that this mother and daughter could be reunited, that their family could be together. Nianbing now felt fortunate. During the days he lived with Feng Nu, he didn’t know how many times he had almost failed to control his desires and break that final barrier with Feng Nu, but he had always held back. Now, he was grateful for his actions. If something had happened between him and Feng Nu, his death would undoubtedly be a tremendous blow to her, possibly even affecting her happiness for her entire life. Unexpectedly, his restraint stemming from his familial bond with Feng Nu had, in this tragic situation, played a crucial role.\n\nNianbing forgot all selfish thoughts. He knew that even if he didn’t die now, having lost most of his life force, he wouldn’t live for very long. He dared not imagine what he looked like now; perhaps he had already turned into an old man.\n\nA cold, ominous aura reappeared, pulling Nianbing back from his thoughts. He struggled to pry open his eyelids and saw Evil Moon, completely unharmed, with the Vampire Queen Sasha and the Underworld Warlock Saphon by his side.\n\nNianbing felt no surprise. He merely thought silently to himself: ‘I’m sorry, Galmandy, Fatty, I’ve done my best. Do you know, my taking of the four Bottles of Modus’s Seal wasn’t to tempt these people of the Evil Lord, but to hide them. When I couldn’t resist them, even if they killed you, they wouldn’t be able to find these four bottles. Let these four bottles sleep forever in my Spatial Ring.’\n\nEvil Moon’s face almost dripped blood. He stared intently at Nianbing, who now had a head full of white hair and a weathered face. In reality, it wasn’t as easy as it appeared on the surface. Evil Moon was, after all, a formidable being whose power surpassed that of a God-Descender. The moment he sensed something amiss, he immediately distanced himself from the energy explosion storm. Although that wasn’t enough to let him escape unscathed, as a powerhouse of darkness, he redirected the impact he should have received onto his subordinates. Originally, there were hundreds of dark powerhouses; now, only he, Saphon, and Sasha remained. Although Evil Moon still retained over seventy percent of his power, the strength he had accumulated over hundreds of years had been largely destroyed by Nianbing in a single day. His hatred ran bone-deep.\n\nA piercing scream escaped Sasha’s lips. Although her power was also extremely close to the realm of a God-Descender, the scene just now had been truly terrifying. Sasha knew that if the energy impact Evil Moon received hadn’t been completely resolved, the next one to suffer would have been Saphon, and the last, herself. Watching her subordinates one after another receive the impact and turn to ashes via Evil Moon’s energy transference ability, she, as the Vampire Queen, was filled with dread.\n\nHer figure flashed, and Sasha extended long claws, reaching for Nianbing on the ground. She wanted to destroy—destroy this human who had almost silenced them. Vampires’ lives were almost endless; death was absolutely the most terrifying thing to her.\n\n“Stop!” Evil Moon grabbed Sasha, pulling her back. He said coldly, “This person cannot die yet.”\n\n“Why?” Sasha looked at Evil Moon, puzzled.",

    "content": "\"He's still useful now,\" Xie Yue said chillingly¹. \"Although the Seven Dragon Kings have likely encountered some trouble, we nevertheless have to release him. This human protected the Seven Dragon Kings at the cost of his own life; given the Seven Dragon Kings' personalities, they will absolutely protect this human. He is now my bargaining chip.\" As he spoke, Xie Yue flung Sina aside and slowly walked over to Nian Bing, crouching down. Looking at Nian Bing's pale, bloodless skin, and his head full of snow-white hair, Xie Yue actually smiled. \"Human, do you know? Ever since I reached the Lich realm, I never imagined I'd be stopped by a human. I haven't been in touch with the outside world for a long time. Have humans changed now? Have they all learned self-sacrifice? You should have died, but it seems you have some life-saving item on you, so you were able to hold onto a breath. Don't worry, I won't let you die until I achieve my purpose on this trip. For you, having lost your magic power and a healthy body, living is more painful than dying.\"\n\nThe muscles on Nian Bing's face twitched. He said weakly, \"Is... that... what you... think...? I should... be... dead, but... I'm... still... alive... because I... want to... see how... you die.... I think... the Seven Dragon Kings have already... completed what they need to do, and I want to watch... them... kill you... before I... am willing to die...\"\n\nA murderous glint flashed in Xie Yue's eyes. \"Are you forcing me to kill you? Don't dream. I won't kill you. Sina. Take him. We're going into the cave. Remember, do not lay a hand on him without my command. He is so weak now that he could die at any moment.\" With that, he led the way into the cave!\n\nNian Bing's whole body trembled as he was lifted by Sina. Though Sina longed to crush this human in her hand like an ant, she dared not defy Xie Yue's command.\n\nNian Bing closed his eyes, breathing faintly. He was somewhat surprised to find that his body's functions were gradually recovering. Although the recovery was very, very slow, faint, cool sensations constantly flowed from various parts of his body, nourishing his body and mind. He didn't know what was happening, but he vaguely guessed that it might be related to the Innate Qi² he had absorbed. He didn't move, not even daring to reveal the slightest change in himself, relying on his body to continuously accumulate strength. He didn't hope to survive. As Xie Yue had said, for him, having lost his power, living was more painful than dying. He now only wanted to gather a bit more energy. At the last moment, he hoped to see if he could help the Seven Dragon Kings, or, in the best-case scenario, destroy the four Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottles³.\n\nThe cave was very deep. Xie Yue walked very cautiously. After all, in this region, without the support of various magical energies, even though he cultivated the most evil abilities, he was still inseparable from magical elements. To obtain the Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottles, he had to use his remaining abilities carefully.\n\nThe deep cave finally reached its end. Xie Yue, Safen, Sina, and Nian Bing all saw what lay before them. The Seven Dragon Kings were shining with seven-colored light, continuously channeling their energy into a giant dragon egg. A few cracks had already appeared at the top of the dragon egg, and a faint grey light slowly emanated, indicating that hatching was not far from success.\n\nSeeing everything before him, Xie Yue was first stunned, then he laughed. Of course, he could guess why this was happening. Wicked laughter filled the deepest part of the cave. \"Hehehehe, I didn't expect to come here so carefully and cautiously, only to see such a scene. The union of the Light Dragon King and the Dark Dragon King, giving birth to a monster! It seems I didn't come too late; I've arrived just in time for the most exciting part. No wonder you had a human guard outside; so something so splendid was happening inside.\"\n\nGalamandis roared, \"Bastards! We won't spare you!\"\n\nXie Yue said indifferently, \"If you had the power to not spare me, you would have acted already. Oh, no, it's not that you lack the power; it's that your power is currently being used to save the dragon egg. Fire Dragon King, don't be so hot-tempered. Carefully control your energy, or not only will the dragon egg be finished, but your good brothers here will suffer along with it. I don't want to waste more words on you. You should know I have no interest in dragon slaying. Hand over the Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottles, and I can spare you.\"\n\nKa'aodilisi chuckled, \"Are you serious? You belong to the forces of evil. I've heard the funniest joke in the world today. Does a Lich like you have any credibility?\"\n\nXie Yue calmly said, \"And what if I don't have credibility? Do you have the right to choose now? I'll count to three. If you don't hand over the Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottles, don't blame me for being impolite. In your current state, you have no chance of resisting me.\"\n\nSina threw Nian Bing aside. Although Nian Bing no longer had any use, Xie Yue hadn't spoken, so she dared not easily kill Nian Bing. The Necromancer Safen's long-accumulated power gradually released, and the cave instantly grew cold.\n\n\"One.\" Xie Yue's voice rang out like a curse from hell. The hearts of the Seven Dragon Kings tightened simultaneously. They all knew that although the dragon egg was about to hatch, it wouldn't be successful in a mere moment.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings looked at each other, their eyes gradually becoming calm. Faced with the threat of death, as a proud race, they showed no fear.\n\n\"Two.\" The hellish voice rang out again. The entire cave became even more silent. The Vampire Queen's blood-red wings slowly spread, and the Necromancer Safen's mist deepened in color. They were ready to act at any moment.\n\nJust then, a sound broke the silence. \"Cui gao, Cui gao⁴!\"\n\nIncluding Xie Yue and his two companions, everyone was stunned, because this sound came from the giant dragon egg itself. The cracks on the dragon egg's surface suddenly became even more numerous. This strange cry was something not only Xie Yue's group had never heard, but even Galamandis and the other Dragon Kings were hearing for the first time.\n\n\"Cui gao, Cui gao...\" The egg cried out again. A cold glint flashed in Xie Yue's eyes. Intense killing intent made the surrounding air grow even colder. He knew he couldn't wait any longer. Once the little Dragon King hatched, the Seven Dragon Kings would immediately regain their combat ability. Even if they were much weaker from hatching the dragon egg, they would still not be something his three could resist.\n\nSeeing the third word about to be uttered, Nian Bing, lying on the ground, rolled over and leaped beside the Fire Dragon King Galamandis. His body swayed, but in his palm, there was now an item: a Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottle.\n\n\"Don't make a sound, or I'll destroy this bottle,\" Nian Bing said, still weak, but his voice was no longer as broken as before.\n\nXie Yue saw the Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottle, and the light in his eyes instantly grew fervent. \"Good. I can spare them. Hand over the bottle, and the other three bottles.\"\n\nNian Bing laughed chillingly, \"I never thought you'd spare them. In that case, let's all perish together!\" As he spoke, he gathered an ice pick and fiercely stabbed it at the bottle. Although he had just regained his perception of ice and fire energies, Nian Bing deeply believed his strength was enough to destroy the porcelain bottle in his hand.\n\nXie Yue didn't move, merely looking at Nian Bing with disdain. With a soft crunch, the ice pick turned into blue powder. Nian Bing's body trembled as a layer of black aura emanated from the Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottle. Under the force of the rebound, the Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottle actually flew out of his hand. Xie Yue casually snatched it, already holding the Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottle in his grip.\n\n\"Hmph. There's something you don't understand, something even the Seven Dragon Kings don't know. These ten bottles⁵ – don't even talk about your tiny ice pick – not even Forbidden Spells can destroy them. This Seal Bottle contains not only the curse of the Lost Kingdom but also the divine power added by those self-righteous fellows from the Continent of Gods. How could it be so easily destroyed?\"\n\nListening to Xie Yue's casual words, Nian Bing's heart instantly sank to rock bottom. His original hopes completely vanished. Not only had the opponent seized one Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottle, but more importantly, he had exposed the fact that the Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottles were on him. One wrong step leads to many. Just then, Xie Yue no longer paid attention to the Seven Dragon Kings. His gaze, almost solidified, fixed on Nian Bing. His green eyes distorted into an eerie blue, and his voice was as if murmuring, \"Give them to me. Give me the remaining three bottles too.\"\n\nIf Nian Bing had been in his peak state at this moment, able to use his Heavenly Eye Point, although his strength was vastly inferior to Xie Yue's, he would not have been enchanted by his light. But Nian Bing's body was now at its weakest point. With his weak life force and negligible magic power, how could he contend with such a powerful existence as a Lich?\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings simultaneously roared, wanting to awaken Nian Bing, but immersed in Xie Yue's eerie blue eyes, he could no longer hear any external sounds. The remaining three Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottles were one by one taken out and personally handed to Xie Yue.\n\nXie Yue smiled. This time, it was a laugh of pure abandon. After a thousand years of planning, he had finally obtained all seven Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottles. How could he not laugh? With these seven bottles, he would have the key to ruling the entire continent. A thousand years of anticipation finally realized; his face was somewhat contorted, and his evil aura rapidly fluctuated unstably.\n\nWith a fierce wave of his hand, Nian Bing was thrown aside. Xie Yue's control over him was also simultaneously released. He did not kill Nian Bing. Just as he himself had said, he would let Nian Bing live. After all, Nian Bing was already a cripple; for him, living was more painful than dying. Especially after handing over the three Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottles, this pain became even more intense.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings simultaneously revealed looks of sorrow. No one had expected things to develop to this point. But could they blame Nian Bing? No. How could they blame someone who had almost sacrificed his life for them? Moreover, Nian Bing's actions were completely beyond his control!\n\nNian Bing woke up. He clearly knew everything that had happened, but everything that happened was something he could not stop no matter what. Watching helplessly as he himself delivered the bottles, which concerned the safety of the continent, into Xie Yue's hands—that pain was incomparable. Even though it was not his will, he had betrayed the hopes of the Seven Dragon Kings. Looking at Xie Yue, his eyes were filled with remorse and despair. One wrong step, and the entire game was lost. His hands, from clenching too hard, had broken his palms with his fingernails. His teeth had bitten through his own lips. He hated so much. The rage in his heart burned almost to its limit. His internal energy seemed to have recovered slightly from the burning of his anger, but now, everything was too late.\n\nXie Yue's laughter lasted for the duration of a meal before it stopped. He lowered his head, gazing at the four Mo'ao'dasi Seal Bottles in his hands, his eyes full of obsession.\n\n\"Cui gao, Cui gao...\" The egg cried out again, jolting Xie Yue awake from his extreme ecstasy. His gaze once again turned cold. Looking at the Seven Dragon Kings, who were still struggling, he said faintly, \"Everything should end now. Let's start with this squawking egg.\" A red evil light condensed in his hand. Suddenly, he raised his hand and unleashed a ray of death light towards the tiny creature that was about to hatch.\n\nAt this moment, who could stop him? The Seven Dragon Kings wanted to move, but their energy was completely drawn to the egg, so they could only watch helplessly as the malevolent red light slowly cut through the air, heading towards the dragon egg. Just as the Seven Dragon Kings closed their eyes, awaiting this final moment, a pained cry made them reopen their dragon eyes.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings all saw a scene that made their blood boil: a tall figure suddenly leaped up, and the red evil light shot straight into his chest. Under the impetus of that malevolent light, the person who had suddenly jumped up—Nian Bing—suddenly surged towards the dragon egg, which was still crying \"Cui gao, Cui gao.\" And the red evil light, after piercing through his body, had already landed on the egg.\n\nA clear shattering sound, as if the hearts of the Seven Dragon Kings had shattered. The dragon egg had broken. How could the evil light unleashed by a Lich be resisted by an eggshell?\n\n---\n¹ Translator's Note: The original Chinese character here, 玲 (líng), typically means 'tinkling' or 'exquisite'. Given the context of Xie Yue's character, it is highly likely a typo for 冷 (lěng), meaning 'cold' or 'chilling'. This translation proceeds with the assumed meaning of 'chillingly'.

The translation maintains \"ten bottles\" as written.",

    "content": "The next moment, Nian Bing’s body heavily impacted the shattered dragon egg. His vision went black. He finally completely lost consciousness, his last shred of life quietly slipping away.\n\nHowever, no one noticed that beneath Nian Bing, the nascent dragon about to hatch from the egg transformed into a mass of gray energy. This energy mass precisely entered his body through the wound in Nian Bing’s back.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings simultaneously trembled violently, opening their mouths to spew out a mist of blood. An intense warning arose in Xie Yue’s heart. He was surprised to find that although the dragon egg was destroyed, the Seven Dragon Kings were not as severely wounded as he had imagined.\n\nThe first to rush up was the Fire Dragon King, Galamandis, filled with sorrow and indignation. A layer of purplish-red energy congealed on the surface of his fists. The Fire Dragon was enraged. Having lived for tens of thousands of years, he had never, not for a single moment, been as furious as he was now.\n\nImmediately after, the other six figures, including the weakened Light Dragon King Dementide, all soared up. The seven-element magical energies instantly expanded to every corner of the cave.\n\nDid Xie Yue dare to block Galamandis’s strike? If it were only the Fire Dragon King, he would certainly block Galamandis’s attack without hesitation. Although his own strength had been weakened by Nian Bing, Galamandis was also not in his best state. Under such circumstances, he would not be afraid of Galamandis at all. However, he was not only facing the Fire Dragon King! Once he blocked Galamandis’s punch, he would lose his last chance to escape. The Seven Dragon Kings themselves were extremely terrifying existences. The Seven Dragon Kings in their rage were terror among terrors. If their power were fully unleashed, even destroying a nation would not be a difficult feat.\n\nBefore coming here, Xie Yue had already made thorough preparations. When he realized something was wrong, he immediately tore open a precious magic scroll on his person. A Level 10 long-distance teleportation magic array instantly activated. Propelled by Xie Yue’s own evil energy, the entire magic array erupted at maximum speed. Silver light instantly enveloped Saphne the Necromancer and Seena the Vampire Queen beside him. Galamandis’s punch landed on nothing but an afterimage.\n\nBoom.... The Fire Dragon King’s furious punch was like a fire dragon bursting from its lair. The formidable fire energy unleashed a violent roar. The already spacious cave passage was expanded by more than double under his single punch. However, the hatred in his heart found no relief whatsoever. “Bastards. It’s spatial magic again, damn it! I, Galamandis, swear in the name of the Fire Dragon King, if I don’t kill you bastards and tear you to shreds, I swear I am no dragon!”\n\nA firm and powerful hand tightly gripped Galamandis’s shoulder. “Enough. Calm down. See if your friend can still be saved.”\n\nThe melancholic voice was filled with sorrow. It was precisely the Dark Dragon King, Kajeosis.\n\nGalamandis turned around, looking at the seemingly calm Dark Dragon King, and lowered his head. “I’m sorry, I couldn’t protect your child.”\n\nA faint smile barely appeared on Kajeosis’s face. “It’s too late for everything. You all did your best. Perhaps, this is fate. The union between Dementide and me was inherently against the heavens. Perhaps, heaven does not wish for us to have a child.” As he spoke, he walked to the Light Dragon King Dementide, who had already transformed back into human form and stood there dazed, looking at Nian Bing and the shattered eggshells, gently embracing her.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings all fell silent. Their emotions were extremely agitated and gloomy. This time, they, the Seven Dragon Kings, reputed as the most powerful on the continent, were defeated. And the defeat was so devastating. Not only was Kajeosis and Dementide’s child not saved, but even the ten Goudas Sealing Bottles entrusted to them by the Dragon God were all lost. They naturally understood what this meant.\n\nKajeosis gently said to Dementide: “Look at that human. If it weren’t for him, we probably wouldn’t even have heard our child’s cry. He used his own life to buy us so much time. If I could, I would trade my life for his.”\n\nGalamandis said faintly: “No need. Nian Bing used life curse magic. For him to hold on this long is already an anomaly. To contend with that Evil Lord, the energy he unleashed reached the level of a Divine Descent spell. Although I don’t know how he did it, to complete such a massive spell at the cost of his life, he himself could not possibly survive. What’s more, at the last moment, he used his own body to block that evil light. I’m afraid there isn’t a single complete part left inside his body now.”\n\nSpeaking of this, two streams of tears slowly flowed down Galamandis’s face. He took heavy steps, walking inch by inch to Nian Bing’s side, looking at Nian Bing’s broken body, looking at his head of snow-white hair. Galamandis’s voice choked. “Nian Bing. I, Galamandis, have always been arrogant. From the moment we first met, I’ve been using you, using you to cook for me. To taste the delicious food you made, I even threatened you. Do you know? Even those humans of the Fire Dragon-kin who are completely loyal to me haven’t had as much contact with me as you have. Unbeknownst to me, I had already come to regard you as my friend, my brother. Because of the Goudas Sealing Bottles incident, I left your side. I found Fatty, hoping his earth element abilities could give you more support. After all, with the help of his abilities, your body would become tougher. But you just died like this, died for us. I can’t remember how many humans have died to slay dragons, but as for humans who died to save dragons, besides those white-haired ancestors*, I’m afraid you are the only one. Brother, my good brother, may your heroic spirit rest in peace. Accept this bow from Galamandis.” As he spoke, Galamandis swept aside the front of his robes and, with a thud, knelt before Nian Bing. As a proud dragon, especially a Dragon King, for him to kneel before a human was a first in the history of the Dragon Race.\n\nHowever, Galamandis’s action did not meet with any opposition from the other Dragon Kings beside him. They all silently gathered around Nian Bing and the dragon egg’s remains. The Dark Dragon King Kajeosis, supporting his wife who was already tear-streaked and uncontrollably convulsing, knelt down. “Galamandis is right. Nian Bing, you are his brother. And you are also a good brother to us, the Seven Dragon Kings. You were our brother when you were alive, and even now that you are gone, you still are. Although our child was not born into this world, you have done your best. You don’t need to feel regret over the Goudas Sealing Bottles; that was not your fault. You helped us at the cost of your own life. This kindness, our Dragon Race will remember for generations. On behalf of my wife and myself, I say to you: Brother, farewell.” As he spoke, he and the Light Dragon King Dementide, still kneeling, slowly bowed, performing the Dragon Race’s most solemn bow to Nian Bing.\n\n“It’s me, it’s all my fault!” With a thud, Fatty, the Earth Dragon King, knelt beside Galamandis. “Nian Bing. Good brother, I shouldn’t have brought you here! If it weren’t for me, perhaps you would still be sharing the sweetness of love with your wife. But now you’re dead. How am I going to explain this to your wife! Nian Bing,…” Saying this, he was already sobbing uncontrollably. Among the Dragon Kings, apart from the Fire Dragon King Galamandis, his feelings for Nian Bing were the deepest. At this moment, he seemed to still see Nian Bing’s focused expression when cooking, and Nian Bing’s persistent efforts to overcome himself. However, at this very moment, Nian Bing’s body had begun to turn ice cold, his life force gradually dissipating into the air.\n\nThe Wind Dragon King Karodilis, the Space Dragon King Kaodilis, and the Ice Dragon King Sarris successively knelt around Nian Bing. They all showed their respect to Nian Bing using the Dragon Race’s most solemn etiquette. They harbored no resentment towards Nian Bing for the loss of the Goudas Sealing Bottles. Because they all knew clearly that Nian Bing had done his best. A human, a human not yet at the Magician rank, facing the simultaneous assault of the most powerful Lich, Necromancer, and Vampire Queen from the Evil Domain, actually managed to hold out for a full two hours. That was not merely a display of strength. More importantly, it was a display of spirit, and a promise to a friend.\n\n(Moved...)\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings watched sorrowfully. They all wanted to send Nian Bing and the dragon egg’s souls off with their gaze. The hearts of the seven of them were now linked as one. After the events here concluded, even if it meant traversing the entire continent, they would seek out Xie Yue and his cohorts. No one could offend the dignity of the Dragon Race, or harm the Dragon Race, without receiving punishment.\n\nJust as the entire cave was filled with an aura of sorrow, a strange sound left the Seven Dragon Kings dumbfounded.\n\n“Gui gao, gui gao…**” How familiar that sound was! How clear it was! The Seven Dragon Kings froze simultaneously. Because they were surprised to find that this sound actually came from Nian Bing’s mouth. Before, due to their excessive grief, they hadn’t noticed that a faint gray airflow had been continuously rising from the massive wound on Nian Bing’s chest. The airflow gently hovered around the wound; no more fresh blood flowed from Nian Bing’s body.\n\n“Gui gao, gui gao…” The strange sound rang out again. This time, the Seven Dragon Kings, focusing their attention, simultaneously saw Nian Bing’s lips twitch as the sound emerged.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings exchanged glances. The Light Dragon King Dementide, who had been nearly unconscious from losing her child, suddenly awoke. “Child, my child, where is it?”\n\n“Gui gao, gui gao…”\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings almost simultaneously gathered around Nian Bing. Through the probing of their spiritual energy, they simultaneously discovered a strange phenomenon: Nian Bing’s body was undergoing changes, extraordinarily wondrous changes. His skin, which had lost its luster and grown aged due to excessive loss of life force, was slowly regaining its radiance under the influence of an unknown energy. And his damaged internal organs were actually regenerating on their own under the effect of that strange energy. The wound on his chest was slowly healing. Not only his skin and meridians, but even his bones were gradually recovering.\n\n“What’s going on?” the Fire Dragon King Galamandis asked the Light Dragon King Dementide, who was most skilled in healing.\n\nDementide’s eyes were filled with loss, for she had not found her child among the shattered eggshells. Taking a deep breath, the now clear-headed Dementide barely managed to calm the turmoil in her heart. She knelt down, carefully observing Nian Bing’s condition. Suddenly, she gasped, “No, this is impossible! This is absolutely impossible! He was clearly dead.”\n\nGalamandis’s heart beat a few faster, and he asked urgently: “Dementide, explain more clearly. What’s impossible? What exactly is Nian Bing’s condition now?”\n\n“Impossible, impossible.” Dementide stared blankly at Nian Bing. “You all know what his condition was; he was already as bad as it could get, as dead as could be. But I just suddenly detected that there’s still a trace of life force remaining in his already shattered heart. How is this possible? Although this trace of life force is extremely faint, this tiny bit of aura is the seed of his life. One could say, it is precisely due to the existence of this trace that he held onto his last breath and did not truly die. Moreover, his current physical condition is also very strange. As you all can see, his body is recovering in a miraculous way. Such a recovery, almost visible to the naked eye, can only be achieved by the Light-element Level 11 Forbidden Spell, Angel’s Eye. But we haven’t cast any magic to save him! Could he be carrying some magical treasure himself? What surprises me the most is that not only is his body gradually recovering, but even the life force he lost through the curse is also gradually returning. And this life force does not seem to belong to him. Yet this life force is assimilating his own life force, causing his life force to grow from nothing.”\n\nGalamandis said: “Then, can he live again? If this continues, can he live again? What should we do?” What he cared about most was Nian Bing’s life!\n\nDementide shook her head, saying: “I don’t know. Because I have never encountered such a situation, I cannot determine his current state. Right now, there’s nothing we can do but wait and see how his body develops. Since he still has life force, as long as his brain can revive, then there’s a possibility he can live again. It’s just that I can’t be sure what he will be like if he does revive. After all, the previous injuries were too severe, and his body has lost the control of his brain. It’s very possible that his life might be restored, but he could remain in an eternal slumber.”\n\nGalamandis smiled. “Enough. This is enough. As long as he can recover his life force, I will keep him by my side forever. He is my brother, and I will not let anyone harm him.”\n___\n* *white-haired ancestors*: In this context, \"白人\" (bái rén) can mean \"white people\" or \"people with white hair.\" Given Nian Bing's own hair turned white due to his power, and the fantastical setting, it likely refers to specific revered ancestors who possessed white hair, possibly indicating wisdom or immense power.\n** *Gui gao, gui gao…*: An onomatopoeic sound representing a high-pitched cry or call, likely from the newly hatched creature.",

    "content": "「Cuigao, Cuigao...」 Nian Bing's lips parted once more, emitting a sound immensely familiar to Di Manteti.\n\nDark Dragon King Katiaosis gaped. \"What's going on? There's still a sound coming out.\" Suddenly, he realized a possibility, and his wife Di Manteti also thought of it at the same time. The two almost simultaneously looked at each other, their bodies shaking violently.\n\nGaramandis noticed the couple's unease and hastily asked, \"What's wrong with you? Has Nian Bing changed somehow?\"\n\nKatiaosis forced a smile. \"You heard that cry just now, too. It came from Nian Bing's mouth.\"\n\nGaramandis was stunned at first. He had only been concerned with Nian Bing's life and death and hadn't paid attention to what the sound was. Now, enlightened by the Dark Dragon King, he pondered slightly and instantly widened his eyes in surprise. \"You, you mean to say, your child isn't dead, and he even fused with Nian Bing's body?\"\n\nKatiaosis forced a smile. \"I'm afraid that's the truth, but I'm not certain right now. However, to explain the cry from Nian Bing's mouth, this is probably the only possibility. Thinking back now, although that evil light had been greatly weakened after penetrating Nian Bing's body, I even heard a faint sound of something shattering. Immediately after, that evil light struck our child's egg. At that time, the power of the evil light had already decreased significantly. Otherwise, given the Lich's strength, our child would have probably been reduced to dust by that evil light. From the remaining eggshell, it can be seen that the evil light at that time no longer had the ability to completely destroy. Let's make a bold hypothesis: Di Manteti's and my child possessed a very strange energy aura, which nearly caused us to be destroyed when trying to hatch it. Although the evil light destroyed its physical body, its energy did not disappear. At that moment, Nian Bing happened to be severely wounded and collided with its energy, and our child's energy entered his body through Nian Bing's wounds. As for why they fused, that's beyond my explanation.\"\n\nGaramandis said somewhat nervously, \"Then what are you going to do now? If your child is truly inside Nian Bing's body, then...\"\n\nTears streamed from Di Manteti's eyes again. \"Garamandis, setting aside that our child no longer exists, even if he truly physically exists within Nian Bing's body, we wouldn't do anything to Nian Bing. After all, if our child is truly alive, his life was given by Nian Bing. If Nian Bing hadn't discovered its energy characteristics, perhaps my child and I would have been gone long ago. Moreover, our child's body was destroyed by that evil light. Even if it still exists, it's just a mass of energy. If Nian Bing's body hadn't fused with this energy, we wouldn't hear its cries again at all. Right now, I don't want to think about anything else. If Nian Bing's body has truly fused with our child and he's not dead, I will treat him like my own child. It's just that the probability of his brain awakening is likely very, very small.\"\n\nThe fatty frowned. \"Is there really no chance at all? His body and life force have recovered; there must be a chance to awaken his brain. Furthermore, don't forget that Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye Acupoint has already opened. A miracle might not be impossible.\"\n\nKatiaosis nodded. \"Nian Bing's current situation is already a miracle in itself, and I also hope a miracle happens again. If his body fully recovers, we will try to awaken his spiritual power. From my memory, awakening spiritual power is an extremely difficult task; it seems no one has ever succeeded in history. Perhaps we should do something for him.\"\n\nWind Dragon King Carodilis, standing by, brightened his eyes. \"You mean, we summon the Dragon God?\"\n\nKatiaosis nodded. \"Whether for Nian Bing or for our lost seven Mu'aoda Sealing Bottles, we must contact the Dragon God and let him decide what we should do next. Since it has happened, let's just confess our sins to him. The Yangguang Continent is no longer under our control. With the Lich's strength, if he deliberately wishes to hide, even though our strength is great, finding him will not be an easy task.\"\n\nThe Dragon Kings nodded in agreement with Katiaosis. Although their mood had improved somewhat due to the strange changes in Nian Bing, losing the seven Mu'aoda Sealing Bottles still made them extremely depressed. After all, a mission spanning tens of thousands of years was destroyed just like that. As powerhouses among the Dragon Race, it was arguably the greatest humiliation of their lives.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings shifted their positions, the seven powerful giant dragons regrouping. They formed a circle, surrounding Light Dragon King Di Manteti in the center. They exchanged glances; although unwilling to face it, they all raised their hands.\n\nKatiaosis bit his right middle finger, flicking out a drop of fresh blood. At the same time, a resounding dragon roar escaped his mouth. \"I, Dark Dragon King Katiaosis, with my blood as a guide, Dragon Power existing in darkness! Become intoxicated.\" The fresh blood floated in mid-air without falling. A layer of black aura enveloped his body, and black scales appeared on his human body. The scales rapidly spread, covering every corner of his body in the blink of an eye. From the outside, he had completely become a person covered in scales.\n\nGaramandis bit his right middle finger, flicking out a drop of fresh blood. At the same time, a resounding dragon roar escaped his mouth. \"I, Fire Dragon King Garamandis, with my blood as a guide, Dragon Power existing in flames! Awaken.\" Bright red scales appeared on his body. At this moment, Garamandis was like a burning flame.\n\nSasaris bit her right middle finger, flicking out a drop of fresh blood. At the same time, a resounding dragon roar escaped her mouth. \"I, Ice Dragon King Sasaris, with my blood as a guide, Dragon Power existing in ice! Awaken.\" Icy blue scales, like ice crystals, emerged from her delicate skin. Sasaris's original clothes vanished, revealing her proud figure. However, at this moment, no one was in the mood to admire the beauty before them. In a moment, her body was completely covered in blue scales, and her entire being stood there like an ice sculpture.\n\nThe fatty bit his right middle finger, flicking out a drop of fresh blood. At the same time, a resounding dragon roar escaped his mouth. \"I, Earth Dragon King Papalyucas, with my blood as a guide, Dragon Power existing in the earth! Awaken.\" Dust-like pale yellow began to condense into small rhomboid shapes on the fatty's skin.\n\nCarodilis bit his right middle finger, flicking out a drop of fresh blood. At the same time, a resounding dragon roar escaped his mouth. \"I, Wind Dragon King Carodilis, with my blood as a guide, Dragon Power existing in the wind! Awaken.\" His scales appeared unique: crescent-shaped cyan scales, as if tiny wind blades were pieced together.\n\nKao Dilis bit his right middle finger, flicking out a drop of fresh blood. At the same time, a resounding dragon roar escaped his mouth. \"I, Spatial Dragon King Kao Dilis, with my blood as a guide, Dragon Power existing in darkness! Awaken.\" Silver hexagonal scales grew from his skin, appearing exceptionally magnificent.\n\nFinally, Di Manteti bit her right middle finger, flicking out a drop of fresh blood. At the same time, a resounding dragon roar escaped her mouth. \"I, Light Dragon King Di Manteti, with my blood as a guide, Dragon Power existing in light! Awaken.\" Her scales were round, golden scales overlapping each other, covering her perfect figure.\n\nSeven-colored light burst forth simultaneously. At this moment, the Seven Dragon Kings were not boosting their absolute strength, but rather their entire dragon power.\n\nThe seven drops of fresh blood coagulated together under the infusion of dragon power. The Seven Dragon Kings glowed with the light flames of their respective elements. They simultaneously chanted softly in the dragon tongue. The blood, fused in the air, gradually began to change. Di Manteti let out a long cry. Milky white light instantly covered the blood, and the fused blood seemed to grow under the light's shroud. The red-covered area immediately expanded, outlining a small red hexagram. The Seven Dragon Kings swiftly changed positions; the six surrounding Dragon Kings moved sideways, creating a space. Di Manteti floated out, and the Seven Dragon Kings simultaneously circled the central bloody light. Their chants gradually grew louder, filled with solemnity. Surging dragon power completely sealed the entire cave, and a strange aura gently rose: the sanctity of light, the gloom of darkness, the strangeness of space, the steadiness of earth, the soft murmur of wind, the roar of fire, the sigh of ice — the auras of seven magical elements appeared one after another within the hexagram formed by the dragon blood.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings simultaneously knelt on one knee, calling out loudly, \"By our dragon power as a medium, noble Dragon God! Please hear our plea, descend!\" The blood-red hexagram instantly flared brightly. Amidst surging energy, the hexagram slowly descended. The moment the light touched the ground, a soft white light ascended. The white halo looked like an icy mist. Under the effect of the halo, the Seven Dragon Kings' bodies actually floated up and then descended around them. The halo's range expanded in an instant to every corner within a radius of five *zhang*. The light gradually faded, and a low, immense pressure slowly emerged. The pressure didn't increase to its maximum all at once but deepened gradually. The light shining on the Seven Dragon Kings, led by Dark Dragon King Katiaosis, became even stronger, resisting the ever-increasing pressure. Relying on the combined power of the Seven Dragon Kings, guided by the bloodlines of the Seven Dragon Kings, they awakened the supreme ruler of the Dragon Race, far away on the Divine Continent — the Dragon God.\n\nA low sigh emanated from the milky white light. Gradually, a figure appeared within the light and shadow. It seemed to be a person, shining with dark red light. If one looked closely, they would notice golden air currents mixed within this dark red light. Although it was just a phantom, the pressure it exerted was far greater than that of any of the Seven Dragon Kings.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings again knelt on one knee, respectfully saying, \"Greetings, Dragon God.\" They all lowered their heads. The loss of the seven Mu'aoda Sealing Bottles filled their hearts with guilt.\n\n\"It's been many years, my children. Are you well?\" A voice emerged from the blurry red figure, low and ancient, yet filled with an elder's benevolence.\n\nKatiaosis forced a smile. \"Respected Dragon God, if all were well with us, we wouldn't have disturbed your cultivation and called upon your divine consciousness. We now have two urgent matters awaiting your instructions.\"\n\nThe Dragon God was silent for a moment, then said faintly, \"I imagine at least one matter concerns the Mu'aoda Sealing Bottles. What new discoveries have you made?\"\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings exchanged glances. Garamandis eagerly interjected, \"Dragon God, it's like this, we, we...\"\n\nThe Dragon God's voice suddenly grew severe. \"Stuttering, Garamandis. You haven't made any progress in all these years. Katiaosis, you speak.\"\n\nGaramandis helplessly closed his mouth. The Dark Dragon King glanced at him and said, \"Dragon God, it's like this: the Mu'aoda Sealing Bottles were stolen.\" Immediately, he thoroughly recounted everything that had happened recently, including the matters concerning Nian Bing and the little Dragon King, narrating to the Dragon God without the slightest reservation. Although the Dragon God was powerful, there was a formidable restriction between the Divine Continent and the Yangguang Continent. Even with his vast powers, he couldn't see everything from the Divine Continent. Only now, when the Seven Dragon Kings used a special method to call upon him, could he temporarily arrive here with his divine consciousness.\n\nAfter listening to Katiaosis, the Dragon God's voice grew somewhat cold. \"Why didn't you report to me sooner? Don't you know how important the Mu'aoda Sealing Bottles are?\"\n\nKatiaosis lowered his head and said, \"Forgive us, Dragon God. We originally intended to rely on our own strength to reclaim the stolen bottles, but it happened just as Di Manteti was about to give birth, which allowed the enemy to take advantage. The fault for this matter lies entirely with me. I am willing to bear all guilt, accept all punishment. Please dispose of me.\"\n\nGaramandis quickly said, \"Dragon God, I also had an oversight in this matter; Katiaosis cannot be blamed. After all, he and Di Manteti had a child after so much difficulty<sup>1</sup>. It was my fault for not protecting them well. Katiaosis and Di Manteti have just experienced the pain of losing a child, so please do not punish them. I am willing to bear everything.\"\n\n\"Bear? Can you bear it? Ten thousand years of leisurely life have made all seven of you complacent. Why were you chosen to remain on this continent in the first place? Because the combined strength of you seven could fully handle everything on this continent. But what about you? What have you done? This mistake, starting with Garamandis, your bottle was the first to be lost. Yet it didn't grab your attention. All of you are guilty.\"\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> The original phrase \"好不補償貿易有了孩子\" appears to be a garbled phrase or typo. Given the context, it has been adapted to \"had a child after so much difficulty\", a common sentiment for a long-awaited child.",

    "content": "「But what use is it for me to punish you now? Don't you know what is sealed within the Mordaas Seal-Bottles? Now that they are all lost, how am I to explain this to the Lords of the God Continent? Once the seals are opened, the great war from ten thousand years ago will reappear. At that time, not only the Yangguang Continent will suffer misfortune, but the God Continent will also be greatly implicated. Once the Lost Kingdom returns, the first thing they will do is seek revenge on the God Continent. Ten thousand years have passed, and no one can know what has happened to them. Furthermore, as noble dragons, you have survived this time only under the protection of a human. You have utterly disgraced the dragon race.\"\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings changed from kneeling on one knee to kneeling on both knees. No one said anything more. They had already anticipated the current situation. Each of them bowed their heads in silence, listening to the Dragon God's reprimand.\n\n\"Kajiois, Dimanteti, you two rise first,\" the Dragon God's voice softened slightly. The Dark and Light Dragon Kings exchanged glances. They dared not defy the Dragon God's command and could only stand up first. The Dragon God sighed and said, \"The reason I chose to entrust the seven Mordaas Seal-Bottles to you seven for protection was not because you are the Seven Dragon Kings. The main reason was because of you two. The other five each have their own shortcomings. Garamandis originally had excellent talent, but he was too negligent. Ka'aodilisi's biggest flaw is his tendency to learn by analogy or draw inferences from other cases*. Perhaps he is not as strong as you, but his breadth of knowledge is the best among you. Yet precisely because of this, he finds it difficult to become a stronger dragon. Karodilisi was originally very good; his attributes in all aspects are outstanding, he is willing to work hard, and his temperament is peaceful. He is a suitable choice for great responsibility. Unfortunately, his talent is limited; to achieve greater accomplishments, he must put in far more effort than any of you. Sasarisi's flaw lies in her arrogance. Our dragon race is inherently proud, but our pride should be in our bones, not evident on the surface. Her arrogance is the greatest original sin limiting her development. As for Papalukas, I don't need to elaborate, do I? You all know his faults: he loves to eat and is lazy, making it difficult for him to amount to anything great**. If it were just the five of them, I would never have suggested to the other Lords that you guard the Mordaas Seal-Bottles. The final choice was made because of Kajiois and Dimanteti. You two also have your own issues, but you complement each other extremely well. Originally, among our dragon race, Light and Dark are not permitted to intermarry. However, because I understood that you were no longer ordinary Light and Dark, I went against public opinion and brought you together. Because of this matter, Garamandis might hate me very much, but I knew that you two were the ones truly in love. What I must fulfill is the duty of the Dragon God, to harmonize the relations of the entire dragon race. In a certain sense, I am not a good father; I did not let my son obtain what he desired most. However, I have never regretted it.\"\n\nThe Dragon Kings' gazes all converged on Garamandis. Garamandis lowered his head, complex light continuously flickering in his eyes. Yes, the current Dragon God was indeed his father, and also the strongest being in the entire dragon race. Back then, he couldn't understand why his father brought Kajiois and Dimanteti together instead of fulfilling his own wishes. Garamandis was able to become the Dragon King of the Fire Dragons without relying even slightly on his father's power. He inherited the Dragon God's best genes, but as a youth, he was extremely negligent, disregarding cultivation. The Dragon God also never forced him, letting him develop freely. It wasn't until Dimanteti married Kajiois that the obsession in Garamandis's heart fully awakened. It was from that moment that he desperately strived to cultivate, relying on his own strength to defeat all competitors and ascend to the position of Fire Dragon King. However, it was also from that time that he never again called the Dragon God 'father.' He never blamed the Dragon God for not helping him improve his strength, but the matter of Dimanteti became an eternal dream in his heart. The most important goal of his diligent cultivation was to prove that he was stronger than Kajiois. He constantly thought that if his strength had been superior to Kajiois's back then, perhaps Dimanteti would not have chosen the Dark Dragon King, but him instead. In the realm of regret, Garamandis's strength advanced by leaps and bounds. During the great war ten thousand years ago, he finally became the strongest among the Seven Dragon Kings, second only to Kajiois. Now, he was confident that his strength was in no way inferior to Kajiois's. However, at the same time, he also realized that Dimanteti would never belong to him.\n\nThe Dragon God's tone was very flat, as if he wasn't speaking of his own family matters. He continued, \"Kajiois, do you know where you went wrong? Your mistake was that you did not inform me after Dimanteti became pregnant. As the Dark Dragon King, as the strongest among the Seven Dragon Kings, don't you understand that your dark constitution and Dimanteti's light constitution are completely conflicting? Even if your bodies are exceptionally powerful, do not forget that the life you conceive will also inherit your powerful traits. If you had told me in advance that Dimanteti was carrying your child, I would have certainly dealt with matters here as soon as possible and brought Dimanteti back to the God Continent to give birth. Then, none of the subsequent events would have occurred. Perhaps you didn't want to trouble them, after all, summoning me requires your combined efforts. But you were wrong. One wrong step caused such great turmoil. Kajiois, do you understand now? What a pity, truly a pity. If your and Dimanteti's child could have been born safely, perhaps he would have become a new hope for our dragon race, a more powerful dragon. Perhaps even my position would have been inherited by him.\"\n\nKajiois said despondently, \"Dragon God, it is my fault. I have disappointed you. In truth, I always knew I should inform you about Dimanteti, but I...\"\n\nDimanteti, from the side, interrupted Kajiois, saying, \"Dragon God, please don't blame Kajiois. I was the one who didn't let him tell you. I didn't want to cause you any more trouble.\"\n\nThe Dragon God sighed deeply and said, \"Foolish children, you two foolish children, to gamble with your future happiness! Garamandis, do you understand? Everything they did was for you.\"\n\nGaramandis trembled all over, waking from his thoughts. He looked up at Kajiois and Dimanteti. With his ten thousand years of wisdom, he immediately understood the Dragon God's meaning. Indeed, the Dark Dragon King and Light Dragon King not informing the Dragon God after having a child was entirely for his sake. Originally, the union of Kajiois and Dimanteti had caused discord between Garamandis and the Dragon God, father and son. If Dimanteti's pregnancy had been immediately reported to the Dragon God this time, Garamandis would naturally have learned of it. The Dragon God is just and selfless, but the price of justice would have been pushing his son further away.\n\nA bitter smile appeared on his face. Garamandis looked at Kajiois, \"Why did you go to all this trouble? Actually, I had already understood it clearly three thousand years ago: I should not have interfered with your relationship and affected you. Your union was not wrong. Everything between me and the Dragon God has nothing to do with you. I am no longer a child. Many things I can understand clearly.\"\n\nDimanteti gazed deeply at Garamandis, \"Can you truly understand it clearly? If so, then you shouldn't blame the Dragon God for anything. For the just Dragon God, power and responsibility are completely equal. Everything he does is for the sake of the entire dragon race. Garamandis, if you understand, then you will fully know what you should do.\"\n\nGaramandis's brow furrowed slightly, a hint of stubbornness in his eyes. \"Now doesn't seem to be the time to discuss this matter. The Dragon God cannot sustain himself here for much longer. Let us first address the immediate problems. Dragon God, you already know the two matters we wished to speak of. So how do we resolve the issue of the Mordaas Seal-Bottles and the fused body of Nian Bing and the Little Dragon King? Firstly, the enemy is far stronger than we imagined. If they choose to conceal themselves, even if the seven of us exert our full strength, we probably won't be able to find them. Secondly, Nian Bing's current situation is very strange. He was dragged into this matter because of me. He sacrificed himself for us. No matter what, I must help him recover. Can he regain consciousness? Even if it costs my life, it doesn't matter, as long as he can live again.\"\n\nThe Dragon God said indifferently, \"I already know about this matter, Garamandis. There is something I must remind you of: As a Dragon King, your life no longer belongs to you, but to the entire dragon race. Therefore, you have no right to speak of sacrifice. I will deal with the matter of the Mordaas Seal-Bottles with the utmost speed. You don't need to go out and search for anything. Just as you said, if the enemy deliberately conceals themselves, given the strength a Lich can achieve, it would be impossible for you to find them. You must wait. Although the Mordaas Seal-Bottles are lost, those seven bottles have extremely powerful divine prohibitions. To open them requires various factors: the right timing, geographical advantage, and human harmony***, as well as a method to break the curse, before that seal can possibly be opened. What you need to do now is to quickly calculate the nearest Day of Ultimate Yin and then find the direction of the Land of Ultimate Yin on this continent. Only when the Day of Ultimate Yin arrives can the divine prohibitions on the Mordaas Seal-Bottles possibly be broken. At that time, the energy it emits will be extremely vast. With your strength, you will be able to sense it completely. As for what to do then, I don't need to teach you, do I? As for the condition of this human before us, I am also seeing it for the first time. Bring him over. I need to examine his body with my divine sense to determine his exact current situation.\"\n\nGaramandis hurriedly stepped forward, carefully lifting Nian Bing's body with energy, placing him under the white light, allowing the light condensed from the Dragon God's divine sense to envelop Nian Bing's body.\n\nThe white halo gradually grew stronger from its previous evolution. The Seven Dragon Kings all nervously watched the nearly solidified white light. This not only concerned whether Nian Bing could be resurrected but also whether Kajiois and Dimanteti's child could have the hope of rebirth. How could they not be nervous?\n\nThe white light gradually dispersed. Before long, the light finally faded once more. The Dragon God uttered a soft 'Huh?' and said, \"Strange, truly very strange. Is it that even with your strength, you couldn't discern the current situation?\"\n\nGaramandis eagerly asked, \"Then what is his current condition? If the situation continues as it is, is it possible for him to recover?\"\n\nThe Dragon God was silent for a moment before saying, \"It's hard to say. There's only a fifty percent chance. According to the situation you just described, it seems that when the Lich delivered that final fatal blow, he somehow protected a sliver of vital breath****. However, this sliver of vital breath also feels fragmented due to the penetration of evil energy. Precisely because of this, his consciousness, like a normal person's at the time of death, was completely concentrated in his brain. Originally, in this situation, even if he still had a breath, he would have been dead for sure. However, Kajiois and Dimanteti's child was in the exact opposite situation. As you all know, our dragon race is an extremely powerful existence. Our bodies are more formidable than any other creature's, and our spirits cannot even be affected by mental magic. Therefore, in that situation, the weakened evil light could only destroy your child's body, but his dragon soul, filled with peculiar energy, was preserved. That is to say, although his body was completely destroyed, his spirit and dragon soul remained. It was in this special, subtle relationship that they unexpectedly produced a fusion effect. This human called Nian Bing once used his energy to help Dimanteti give birth. Therefore, during the fusion process, Kajiois and Dimanteti's child did not reject the aura of his body. In this situation, a very subtle condition has now formed. From a surface perspective, we can say that this human named Nian Bing, we can consider his spirit dead. However, his body, under the effect of the dragon soul, has gained our dragon race's incredible recovery ability. Furthermore, the energy produced by Kajiois and Dimanteti's child is very rapid, so the recovery ability brought by his dragon soul is much stronger than that of you few. That is to say, this human body will be fully restored in not much time. Relying on our dragon race's strong vitality, the side effects he experienced from the cursed life have been completely compensated for by the vigorous vitality of the newborn dragon child. It can be said that this fused body is no longer human. In a certain sense, he already possesses the physique of a dragon, but still retains a human appearance. Once this body is fully repaired and fused with the dragon soul, your child will awaken and control this body. The reason I said he is strange is because this is already a half-dragon, half-human body, with a human appearance and a dragon's soul fused together. Kajiois, Dimanteti, you can completely regard him as your own child.\"\n\n---\n*   Literally \"to draw inferences about other cases from one instance\"; to learn by analogy or comprehend by extension.\n**   Literally \"difficult to become a great person/achieve great things.\"\n***   A traditional Chinese idiom referring to three essential conditions for success: the right timing, favorable geographical conditions, and human harmony.\n****   A sliver of vital breath/life force.",

    "content": "The Dragon God’s words silenced the Seven Dragon Kings. In Dimantedi’s sorrowful eyes, a bright joyful light shone. “He’s not dead. My child truly isn’t dead. This is wonderful, truly wonderful.”\n\nKajiaoxisi was much calmer than his wife and asked, “Lord Dragon God, what should we do now? Nian Bing has sacrificed so much for us, but my child occupies his body. This doesn’t seem right, does it? Is there no possibility for Nian Bing’s mental energy, which has condensed in his brain, to recover?”\n\nThe Dragon God was silent for a moment, then said, “For ordinary humans, that is indeed the case. When mental energy and consciousness are completely condensed, it means the soul has dispersed; that is true death, or at least the complete death of consciousness. However, this human’s situation is very special. He has already opened the Heavenly Eye Acupoint among the Seven Orifices Acupoints. After his mental energy and consciousness condensed, his soul, which should have dispersed, gathered in the Heavenly Eye Acupoint. If he can regain consciousness, then his Heavenly Eye Acupoint will be fully achieved, and it will become an unprecedented special Heavenly Eye. You must understand, opening the Heavenly Eye Acupoint is extremely rare, not to mention on the Yangguang Continent, but even on the Continent of Gods. It can almost be said that every god who opens the Heavenly Eye Acupoint can become a Lord God, a key cultivation target on the Continent of Gods. However, while the Heavenly Eye Acupoint is good, it has a problem: a drawback that causes conflict with mental energy under certain circumstances. This means that although those with the Heavenly Eye Acupoint can better control their mental energy through the Heavenly Eye in specific situations, in general circumstances, it can conversely affect the development and control of mental energy. Nian Bing’s situation, however, is different. His mental energy has completely fused with the Heavenly Eye Acupoint. Once he opens the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, due to its fusion with mental energy, the drawback will disappear. Only advantages will manifest. In the near future, if he opens one or two more acupoints, greatly increasing his strength, then his future will be immeasurable, far more advantageous than the divine cultivators on the Continent of Gods.”\n\nJialamansidis frowned and said, “Lord Dragon God, you’ve laid so much groundwork, what exactly do you want to say? Just speak plainly.”\n\nThe Dragon God said, “The reason I explained this clearly to you is that I need you to make a choice. This half-dragon, half-human body can only develop in two ways from now on, and you must make a choice. The first way is to let him develop as he is. In that case, although he has a human body, he can be considered a member of our Dragon Race. As Kajiaoxisi and Dimantedi’s child continues to grow, he will be your true child, possessing your child’s thoughts and abilities. He will even gain some things unique to humans. Once he reaches a certain level of strength, his body will even transform due to Dragon Power, using the human body as a base to revert to our Dragon Race’s form. In this way, your child will have returned. And he will also have an extremely bright future. However, if this option is chosen, the human called Nian Bing can be said to be truly dead, because after the Heavenly Eye Acupoint fuses with mental energy, this seal will become increasingly solid, completely sealing him off. The second option is to rely on the power of the seven of you to infuse your Dragon Consciousness into his body, promoting your child’s rapid growth, just like in normal incubation. After about seven days, your child’s consciousness will mature. At that point, by relying on his strength to open the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, Nian Bing’s soul will be released and re-fuse with his mental energy and consciousness. By then, Nian Bing, being the original owner of this body, will regain dominant control over it. All his abilities will also recover as his vitality returns, and coupled with a body fused with Dragon Soul, his strength will increase. However, if this method is chosen, there will be two souls in this body: a human soul and a dragon soul, with the human soul as the dominant one. Unless Nian Bing is willing, you will be unable to communicate with your child’s soul. So, these two methods are: one, the Dragon Son’s rebirth, and the other, the Dragon-Human fusion. As for how to choose, you are his parents, so the decision is yours.”\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings exchanged glances. The Dragon God had made it very clear: if they chose the first option, the little Dragon King would gain true life with Nian Bing’s body as his core. If they chose the second option, Nian Bing could be revived, but the little Dragon King would only be attached to his body. This was an extremely difficult choice. After all, they had nurtured their child for a thousand years to finally have him. How would the Dark Dragon King Kajiaoxisi and the Light Dragon King Dimantedi choose? From a heartfelt perspective, who wouldn’t wish for their child to be by their side rather than attached to someone else?\n\nJialamansidis remained silent. Naturally, he hoped for the second method, but he also wished for Dimantedi’s child to be revived. The complex internal struggle prevented him from expressing an opinion. He simply watched Kajiaoxisi and Dimantedi with a hint of agitation, awaiting the couple’s choice. While the other Dragon Kings’ thoughts differed somewhat from Jialamansidis, they also refrained from expressing their opinions. Everyone knew how difficult this choice was: on one side, their own child, and on the other, a friend and brother who had protected the Seven Dragon Kings with his life. They truly found it hard to say much.\n\nTears streamed down Dimantedi’s exquisite face, and her body trembled slightly. Kajiaoxisi sighed deeply, pulled his wife into his embrace, and closed his eyes. In truth, they had already made their choice the moment the Dragon God presented the two situations, but facing this decision was profoundly painful. When the Dark Dragon King Kajiaoxisi opened his eyes again, he had completely suppressed his emotions deep within. Taking a deep breath, he said, “Lord Dragon God, there’s no need to choose anymore. We choose the second option.” His voice was firm, without any hesitation. Dimantedi simply sobbed softly, resting her head on Kajiaoxisi’s shoulder, but she did not stop her husband. The cave was silent, echoing Kajiaoxisi’s voice. Jialamansidis and the other five dragons all rose from the ground.\n\n“From today onward, I, Fire Dragon King Jialamansidis, swear to honor Kajiaoxisi as my elder brother, as my leader. From now on, Dark Dragon King Kajiaoxisi will be my boss.” Jialamansidis spoke emotionally, his voice already trembling slightly. He knew very well that he might have made the same choice himself, but certainly not with Kajiaoxisi’s absolute resolve.\n\nThe Dragon God’s voice softened. “Kajiaoxisi, Dimantedi. Have you two truly thought this through? If you decide to do this, then you absolutely cannot go back on your word in the future. We, the Dragon Race, are a people who keep our promises. I’ll give you one last chance; it’s still not too late to regret it now. Perhaps this will be the only child you have in your lives.”\n\nKajiaoxisi, having spoken those words, seemed to be relieved. He shook his head and said, “Lord Dragon God. We don’t need to consider it anymore. Without Nian Bing, not to mention our child, even the seven of us might have been annihilated by the enemy. It was he who helped Dimantedi safely lay the dragon egg, and it was he who found the method to incubate the dragon egg. He protected us at the cost of his own life, and finally, he used his own body to protect our child, preventing his utter annihilation of body and spirit. He gave our child a new life; he bestowed upon us immense grace. Such a human is unlike any I have ever seen before. We, the Dragon Race, are a noble people. Having received such profound kindness from him, we ought to repay him properly. I have no right to choose now; even if it meant exchanging my own life for his, I would not hesitate. Moreover, our child is not dead; his Dragon Soul still exists. Although I am not familiar with Nian Bing, I trust his character. Our child will certainly not suffer within his body. Therefore, I no longer need to choose. Lord Dragon God, Dimantedi and I have both decided to do this. This is what we ought to do.”\n\n“Good. Kajiaoxisi, I did not misjudge you back then; I did not trust the wrong person. Your rationality has triumphed over emotion. As the patriarch of the Dragon Race, I am proud of your choice. Dimantedi, you don’t need to be sad anymore. In truth, your child still has a chance for rebirth. However, this opportunity will depend on Nian Bing, this human. If he can become the first human in the world to open all Seven Orifices Acupoints, then his strength will become unimaginable to us. At that time, if he is willing, he can fully help your child reshape a body and transfer his Dragon Soul.”\n\nJialamansidis, who was standing by, froze for a moment, then somewhat angrily said, “Lord Dragon God, why didn’t you say so earlier? If you had told us this sooner, Kajiaoxisi and the others wouldn’t have had to make such a difficult choice. Don’t you know how much pain they’re in right now? The first acupoint Nian Bing opened was the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, and combined with the current uniqueness of his body, it’s not impossible for him to open all Seven Orifices Acupoints.”\n\nThe Dragon God did not get angry at Jialamansidis’s disrespect. Within the milky white radiance, two clusters of red light glowed, each with a golden dot at its center. “Because this was a test, a test for the Dragon God. To be able to give up the chance for your own child’s rebirth in order to save your benefactor, Kajiaoxisi, you have met the requirements of the test. I declare that you shall become the next Dragon God. From this moment on, I will impart to you our clan’s lineage-inherited Dragon God Heart Technique. You must cultivate diligently. When you reach the seventh layer of the Dragon God Heart Technique, you shall take my place.”\n\nThe Dark Dragon King Kajiaoxisi’s entire body trembled. He fell to his knees with a thud. “Lord Dragon God, how can this be? How can you, you hand the position of Dragon God to me? I belong to darkness!”\n\n“What is darkness? Darkness is the dawn before the arrival of light. In time, there is no absolute light, nor is there absolute darkness. Don’t overthink it; my decision is final. My divine consciousness cannot persist for much longer. Concentrate and calm your spirit, and listen to my transmission.” The golden dot within the two clusters of red light extended into a line, piercing directly into the Dark Dragon King Kajiaoxisi’s dragon eye. Kajiaoxisi’s entire body trembled, but he quickly regained stability. Around his body, which originally emanated a dark aura, a layer of golden light gradually enveloped him.\n\nThe Dragon God is the patriarch of the Dragon Race. Historically, the patriarchs of the Dragon Race have always emerged from among the seven elemental lines of giant dragons. During the process of a Dragon God’s emergence, hereditary succession is rare; it is determined by strength, character, and contributions to the Dragon Race. The current Dragon God is the previous patriarch of the Fire Dragon clan, or rather, the previous Fire Dragon King. The Dragon God Heart Technique is the highest cultivation method within the entire Dragon Race. This technique is exceedingly overbearing, and without a strong foundation of strength, it is utterly impossible to cultivate. To uphold the dignity of the patriarch, this Dragon God Heart Technique is passed down through generations to only one person: the succeeding patriarch. In the history of the Dragon Race, there had never been a Dark Dragon God. Kajiaoxisi had never imagined that the Dragon God would choose him instead of his own son, and this choice came even after he had lost the Mo’aodasi Sealing Bottle. The best way to distinguish a Dragon God from an ordinary giant dragon is to observe the light emitted when they unleash their Dragon Power. Any giant dragon, after becoming a Dragon God, will have a layer of golden light, representing the power of the Dragon God, attached to their original energy base. At this moment, the Dragon God’s decision to impart this supreme technique to Kajiaoxisi signified that the successor to the Dragon God’s position had been chosen. Unless Kajiaoxisi were to die by accident, this had become an unchangeable fact.\n\nIf it had been in the past, Jialamansidis’s dissatisfaction with his father might have been more intense. However, his current state of mind was very peaceful, even a feeling of release. For years, his utmost goal in diligent cultivation had been to inherit his father’s position as Dragon God. Now, with nothing left to covet and Nian Bing having a chance of revival, Jialamansidis suddenly found himself very happy to see such a result.\n\nBefore long, the golden radiance gradually faded. The Dragon God’s voice was no longer as clear as before. “Alright, Kajiaoxisi, you must cultivate diligently from now on. I have already told you all the rights and obligations of the Dragon God Heart Technique and our Dragon Race patriarch. I believe that once you inherit my position, you will become an even more outstanding Dragon God than I. Oh, right, there’s one more thing. This human named Nian Bing has made such a great contribution to our Dragon Race; such kindness, we must repay it. When I was just imparting the Dragon God Heart Technique to you, I carefully considered it: the Mo’aodasi Sealing Bottle has been stolen, perhaps this is destiny. I will make a promise to this human: if he can come to the Continent of Gods in the future, I will exert all my power to help him open the strongest human acupoint, the Emperor’s Pole Acupoint, as repayment. If he cannot come to the Continent of Gods in the future, then from now on, his future descendants will receive the protection of our Dragon Race, for three generations. Very well, I must go. You must remember my words: always be mindful of the coming of the Day of Extreme Yin. That day will appear on the human Gui Shui Day*. If I remember correctly, that will be around November two years from now.”\n___\n*Gui Shui Day: A day in the traditional Chinese sexagenary cycle, often associated with water (yin water element).",

    "content": "The milky white light disappeared, and the powerful Dragon's Might brought by the Dragon God also vanished. Nianbing's body lay peacefully on the ground, still emitting that layer of grey aura.\n\nGaramandis showed a faint smile on his face, saying to the Dark Dragon King Kajiosius, \"Boss, congratulations. From now on, you are truly our boss.\"\n\nKajiosius gave a wry smile, \"Actually, your strength and mine are already quite similar; this might have been yours. Having the Dark Dragon Clan as the Dragon God might not be good for our Dragon Clan's future.\"\n\nGaramandis laughed heartily, \"Kajiosius, when did you become so fussy? What's wrong with it? As long as we work together and the Dragon Clan is united, why should we care about the nonsense those ordinary divine beings say? Those Main Gods just sleep all day. Besides, once you become the Dragon God, you'll be one of the Main Gods. Our Dragon Clan forms its own system on the Continent of Gods; why should we care so much about them? If you want the Dragon Clan to develop better, you should diligently cultivate the Dragon God's Heart Cultivation Method. According to my father, the Dragon God's Heart Cultivation Method has thirteen layers. The strongest Dragon God in our clan's history only reached the eleventh layer. If you can reach the thirteenth layer, perhaps even that guy who calls himself the God-King won't be your match.\" Hearing him call the Dragon God 'father,' all the Dragon Kings couldn't help but show a hint of a smile. They knew that Garamandis's unresolved issue had been resolved.\n\n\"Oh, Garamandis, when did your mindset become so good? If someone snatched what I wanted most, I wouldn't be able to bear it.\" Ka'aodililis's loose tongue reappeared after the atmosphere relaxed. Kajiosius's face, which had just relaxed a little, suddenly darkened. \"Space Dragon King Ka'aodililis, when I was communicating with the Dragon God with my mind just now, the Dragon God said that your talent is actually excellent. It's just that you know too much and have learned too many disparate things, which is why you've become the weakest among us Dragon Kings. The Dragon God instructed me to take good care of you.\" As he spoke, a hint of wicked aura emerged from the corner of his mouth—this was the true aura of the Dark Dragon King.\n\nKa'aodililis trembled all over and forcefully slapped his own mouth. \"Boss, no way, the Dragon God would give such an instruction? It's all my fault for this mouth of mine. I, I'll go out to use the restroom first. You all chat, you all chat.\"\n\nThe Fatty grabbed Ka'aodililis, chuckled, and said, \"What? Trying to use a bathroom break as an excuse to escape? Just bear it. We all highly approve of the boss disciplining you properly, so you don't keep loafing around.\"\n\nDimanteti said, \"Alright, stop messing around. Before Nianbing fully recovers, no one is allowed to leave. We can't let any more danger befall him. Let's guard him here. Judging from the speed of his wound healing and body transformation, it's estimated he'll need about three more days to fully recover. At that time, we'll collectively help... help our child evolve.\" As she spoke, her expression couldn't help but darken.\n\nKajiosius embraced his wife tightly. \"Don't be sad. Our child isn't dead. Right? Since that's the case, we have hope. Moreover, before Nianbing revives, we still have seven days. During these seven days, he is our true child! Let's cherish these seven days, alright?\"\n\nGaramandis suddenly said, \"I have a suggestion.\"\n\nThe Dragon Kings' gazes focused on Garamandis. Garamandis pondered for a moment and said, \"Now Nianbing's soul is sealed within his Heavenly Eye Acupoint¹. This is both a bad thing and a good thing. If the time is too short, his soul might not be able to truly merge with the Heavenly Eye Acupoint. My father has already mentioned the disadvantages of too long a time. Furthermore, if the little dragon grows too fast, it will be detrimental to his future development. I suggest extending the seven days to forty-nine days. This way, we can not only help the little dragon grow better, but also allow Nianbing's soul to truly merge with the Heavenly Eye Acupoint. Forty-nine days isn't very long; it shouldn't have too much of an impact on him.\"\n\nAfter hearing Garamandis's words, the first to express her agreement was surprisingly the proud Ice Dragon King Sassaris. She nodded and said, \"I agree with Garamandis's suggestion. This is a very good and safer choice. Anyway, I have nothing to do. After this incident, it's better for us Seven Dragon Kings to reduce acting alone in the future. By staying together more, we can prevent enemies from picking us off one by one.\"\n\nThe Fatty immediately nodded and said, \"I agree too. We've been scattered all over for so many years. Now that we're gathered, let's not separate before this matter is resolved. If anything changes, we can combine our collective strength and ask the Dragon God for guidance. Anyway, for me, as long as there's a place to sleep, it's fine.\"\n\nKarodililis said, \"Good, then it's settled.\"\n\nSeeing that everyone's final gaze fell on him, Ka'aodililis finally showed some intelligence for once and quickly said, \"Good, good, I have no problem at all. It's actually quite nice to be with everyone.\"\n\nDimanteti bowed her head. \"Thank you, thank you all.\" She knew, of course, that while Garamandis's suggestion seemed fine on the surface, it was more about letting her spend a few more days with her child. All the Dragon Kings had lived for tens of thousands of years; who wouldn't understand? They just didn't point it out and even approved Garamandis's suggestion.\n\nFor the Dragon Kings, whose lives are measured in tens of thousands of years, three days passed in an instant. They had been guarding Nianbing inside the cave. By this time, Cold Ridge had passed the period where magic elements disappeared, but an even more terrifying energy storm was wildly raging throughout the entire Cold Ridge. The valley, once as warm as spring, had now become like the outside world, filled with a cold aura, almost to the point where water drips and turns to ice. In this environment, the most pleased were naturally the Fire Dragon King and the Ice Dragon King. The Ice Dragon King loved this weather the most, while the Fire Dragon King Garamandis became a large furnace for the other Dragon Kings to warm themselves. Although it was very cold outside, inside the cave, thanks to Garamandis's aura, it was as warm as spring and very comfortable.\n\nThe chaotic magic element storm could not affect beings as powerful as the Dragon Gods. They could still extract the magic elements they needed from the energy storm. They were all waiting, waiting for Nianbing to wake up.\n\nNianbing's body fully healed in just a day and a half, but he remained in a coma, only occasionally emitting a few \"cui gao, cui gao\" cries each day. Dimanteti always stayed by Nianbing's side. Due to the unique nature of the little Dragon King's energy, she dared not use her own energy to assist, relying solely on the little Dragon King's own abilities.\n\n\"Cui gao, cui gao...\" Nianbing's lips buzzed slightly, immediately catching Dimanteti's attention. Although similar situations had occurred many times in the past few days, each time Dimanteti would look at him with special concern. Maternal love is always the greatest and most selfless love in the world.\n\nKa'aodililis whispered from the side, \"He's just making 'cui gao, cui gao' sounds today. There isn't really that tone in our Dragon Clan language, is there?\"\n\nSassaris said disdainfully, \"Can you even remember how you cried when you were little?\"\n\nDimanteti shot Ka'aodililis a glare. \"Mind your mouth, or else you can go out into the energy storm to train. That should be very good for you.\"\n\nKa'aodililis gave a wry smile. \"Alright, alright, I'm all alone anyway; you all just bully me.\"\n\nThe Fatty, relying on his tall stature, patted Ka'aodililis on the shoulder and said, \"If you don't want to be bullied, you must first become strong.\"\n\n\"Cui gao, cui gao...\" The clear cries once again attracted the attention of the Dragon Kings. Nianbing's body actually moved. He was trembling slightly, seemingly struggling with something.\n\nDimanteti was startled and quickly grabbed Nianbing's hand, softly saying, \"Child, child, how are you? Don't scare Mama!\"\n\n\"Cui gao, cui gao...\" The sound became clearer. Nianbing's lips buzzed, and the skin on his face began to change. His bodily functions had completely recovered, only his hair, which had turned white due to the life curse, remained the same.\n\n\"Cui gao, cui gao...\" Nianbing's eyelids twitched. His eyes slowly opened. His sapphire-blue eyes seemed even clearer than before. He blinked, and his eyes were filled with childlike innocence.\n\n\"Cui gao, cui gao, cui gao, cui gao, gao...\" His voice sounded excited as he buried his head into Dimanteti's embrace, gently rubbing against her ample chest. \"Cui gao, cui gao...\"\n\nThe other male Dragon Kings present, except for Sassaris, were instantly dumbfounded. After all, Nianbing was an adult male, and Dimanteti's current form was that of a beautiful human woman. Such an action was simply too suggestive.\n\nGaramandis coughed, turned around, and walked away. This was a bit too much for him to bear. The Fatty, Ka'ao, and Karodililis (the two brothers) also quickly followed. Sassaris gave Nianbing a deep look and then followed them outside.\n\nDimanteti acted as if she felt nothing, letting Nianbing rub against her chest. Her eyes were filled with the glow of a loving mother as she gently stroked Nianbing's white hair, softly saying, \"Good child, it's alright now. Mama is here with you. Mama will protect you and won't let anyone harm you again.\" In her eyes, Nianbing was her child at that moment, especially the dragon's aura emanating from Nianbing. She was all too familiar with it; having nurtured the little dragon for over a thousand years, she had suffered countless hardships. Even a trace of the little dragon's aura, she could clearly recognize.\n\nKajiosius also squatted down. Although Nianbing rubbing against his wife's embrace made him feel a bit strange, after all, it was his own son who now controlled Nianbing's body, so he could just barely accept this reality.\n\n\"Nianbing\" affectionately rubbed against Dimanteti, completely like an infant. Dimanteti's gaze grew softer and softer.\n\n\"Cui gao, cui gao...\" \"Cui gao, cui gao...\" Nianbing's cries contained a hint of pleading.\n\nUnder the influence of motherhood, Dimanteti immediately understood his meaning. A blush appeared on her pretty face as she looked up at Kajiosius and said, \"Husband, can you... can you go out for a moment? I think, I think the child might want to nurse. He just woke up, and his body is still weak.\"\n\nKajiosius stared at his wife dumbfounded. \"You don't actually intend to breastfeed him, do you? His body recovered very well under the influence of dragon power. I don't think he needs it. Soon, we'll start helping him evolve with our energy. With energy replenishment, eating or not eating won't matter.\"\n\nDimanteti said firmly, \"No, mother's milk is very important for a child. Our child needs nutrition! Husband, he isn't Nianbing right now; he's our child!\"\n\nKajiosius gave a wry smile, \"But his body is still Nianbing's. I, I...\"\n\nDimanteti slightly furrowed her brows and said, \"How can you be like this? He's my child, and he's your child too. Shouldn't a child drink his mother's milk? Husband, if you feel uncomfortable, just go out for now. We finally have a child like this, and I don't want to leave any regrets. Even if I wanted to nurse him again later, it would be impossible.\" As she spoke, a hint of sadness appeared in her eyes. She lowered her head to look at Nianbing, and her gaze became even more benevolent.\n\n\"Nianbing\" opened his sapphire-blue eyes and looked at Kajiosius, full of affection. \"Cui gao, cui gao...\"\n\n\"Alright, alright,\" Kajiosius sighed lightly, somewhat helplessly. \"That's right! He's our child now. Nianbing, you rascal, you're taking advantage of my son.\" For him, there was no one more important in the world than Dimanteti. Let alone being touched by other men, he would get angry if others even looked at Dimanteti too much, but now... He shook his head helplessly, Kajiosius turned around and walked out of the depths of the cave.\n\n\"Ka'aodililis, come on. I'll take you outside to train. Energy storms aren't easy to come by; this is your best chance to train.\"\n\n\"Boss, nooooo...\"\n\nA gentle smile appeared in Dimanteti's eyes. She gently lifted the clothes she had formed from energy, revealing her proud twin peaks.\n\n\"Nianbing\" wasted no time. As soon as he saw the treasure he had hoped for, he immediately cupped a full breast with both hands, leaned in, and gently sucked on the rosy nipple.\n\n---\n¹**Heavenly Eye Acupoint:** In some Chinese fantasy and cultivation stories, this refers to a mystical energy point or spiritual center, often associated with a \"third eye\" or enhanced spiritual perception.",

    "content": "A strange feeling spread throughout Dimantedi's body. Although she clearly knew the person before her was an adult male, she had no other thoughts in her heart. \"Nian Bing\" seemed to have truly transformed into a dragon and was truly her child. The unusual sensation in her chest filled her with a mother's pride. She gently stroked \"Nian Bing\"'s long white hair, carefully nurturing her child.\n\nTen days later.\n\n\"Cui Gao, Cui Gao...\"\n\n\"Alright, stop yelling. You little rascal, you've clearly evolved to the point where you can speak human language, yet you still can't get rid of that baby voice of yours.\" Ka'aodilisi said irritably. He had suffered a lot these past few days. Every morning, when Dimantedi fed \"Nian Bing,\" that period became his nightmare. Each time, Kajia'aoxisi would drag him out into the energy storm for \"training.\" The Spatial Dragon King, who had always been less interested in training, was thoroughly tormented. He clearly knew that Kajia'aoxisi was venting his strange feelings on him, yet he couldn't say anything, or the storm would rage even more fiercely.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Seven Dragon Kings would jointly help the little Dragon King evolve for two hours. During the evolution process, the little Dragon King would absorb a large amount of the seven elemental energies provided by the Seven Dragon Kings. Its evolution process was much faster than imagined. By the eighth day of the Seven Dragon Kings' nurturing, he could already speak. However, the Seven Dragon Kings still hadn't figured out the attribute of this strange creature's energy. They couldn't sense how powerful that abnormal energy was, but they could fully feel its strangeness. A more notable characteristic of the little Dragon King's energy was absorption, especially when the Seven Dragon Kings wholeheartedly channeled their energy into his body; this absorptive trait became even more apparent. Furthermore, his learning ability was extremely strong. When the Seven Dragon Kings transmitted their memories of the dragon race to him, he could quickly and fully comprehend them within eight days.\n\nAlthough the Seven Dragon Kings had slowed down his evolution rate, the little Dragon King's intelligence had already reached the level of an ordinary human around sixteen years old.\n\n\"I want to cry, Mama, Mama, Ka'aodilisi is bullying me.\"\n\n\"What? Ka'ao, you bastard, how dare you bully my son!\" A white light flashed. The enraged Dimantedi rushed out from inside the cave. Without asking why, she punched Ka'aodilisi without a second thought.\n\nKa'aodilisi had to admit that although he had suffered greatly in the energy storm these past few days, his strength had improved remarkably. With a flash of silver light, the Spatial Dragon King's body instantly teleported ten *zhang* away in a dazzling glow. \"Alright, alright, Dimantedi, I say. You're too overprotective, this little rascal is spoiled beyond recognition because of you.\" After speaking, he dared not linger, turning and running outside. When a mother dragon is enraged, it's best to temporarily avoid the sharp edge. Moreover, this mother dragon had strong support behind her.\n\n\"Nian Bing\" chuckled, sidled up to Dimantedi, took her hand, and said, \"Mama is so good, Mama. I want to drink milk.\"\n\nDimantedi's face flushed. She said, \"Darling, you've already eaten today!\nAnd, your current physical condition no longer requires milk.\" \"Nian Bing\"'s body strength, let alone compared to humans, was much stronger even compared to ordinary dragons. When he circulated the energy within his body, a layer of gray scales would naturally condense on his body surface. Kajia'aoxisi had specifically tested it. The strength of these gray scales, compared to the Seven Dragon Kings, was only slightly inferior to the yellow scales of the fat one, who had the strongest defense.\n\n\"No, I want to eat, Mama, I'm hungry.\" \"Nian Bing\" vigorously shook Dimantedi's hand.\n\nKnowing that her child would only be with her for a full forty-nine days, Dimantedi was extremely doting towards \"Nian Bing\" before her. She couldn't bear to go against his wishes. With a helpless smile, she said, \"Alright then, come inside the cave with Mama.\" Saying so, she pulled \"Nian Bing\" and walked towards the inside of the cave.\n\nThe other Dragon Kings were all training in the energy storm outside the cave entrance. After tests by the Dark Dragon King Kajia'aoxisi, training in the energy storm was much more effective than under normal circumstances, so they naturally wouldn't give up such a good opportunity.\n\nKajia'aoxisi was deep inside the cave. Seeing Dimantedi walk in, pulling \"Nian Bing,\" he couldn't help but say to her, \"You shouldn't spoil this child too much. Excessive doting cannot raise good children.\"\n\nDimantedi replied indifferently, \"Am I doting on him excessively?\"\n\n\"No, of course not! Cui Gao, Cui Gao. Papa, what are you doing?\" \"Nian Bing\" echoed his mother's words.\n\nThe word \"Papa\" instantly made all of Kajia'aoxisi's temper vanish. He constantly told himself that this was his son, not a human. He said irritably, \"You little rascal, you're so naughty after just a few days of being born. What will you be like when you grow up? I can ignore your mischief, but you must remember our dragon race's various tenets. Once you violate them, even I cannot forgive you.\"\n\n\"Nian Bing\" stuck out his tongue and said, \"Got it, got it. Papa, I'm going to drink milk now, are you still going out?\"\n\nKajia'aoxisi was stunned for a moment. He said, \"Again? Haven't you already eaten today?\" He wanted to say more, but seeing Dimantedi's almost pleading gaze, he could only sigh helplessly and say, \"Alright, but you must be gentle, okay?\nDon't hurt Mama.\"\n\n\"Of course. Mama is the one who loves me most, how could I bear to hurt her?\"\n\nDrinking milk was \"Nian Bing\"'s most enjoyable activity. Each time, he tried his best to prolong the time, savoring his mother's sweet milk. This time, he drank for a full half hour before reluctantly letting go of the delicious treat in his mouth.\n\n\"What a comfortable feeling! Mama, I don't know why, but although I can't absorb single external energies, supplementing my body through food works perfectly.\"\n\nDimantedi adjusted her clothes and said, \"Perhaps, it's because you currently possess a human body. Darling, what form does the energy within your body take now? Although we can help you evolve, we cannot sense your energy.\"\n\n\"Nian Bing\" thought for a moment and said, \"I'm not sure either; it seems to be a mass of gray energy. When I absorb your energy, I feel very comfortable. Yesterday, after you finished helping me evolve, the volume of that gray energy mass seemed to be smaller than before, located in my chest. I've memorized the Dragonic magic incantations, but for some reason, I just can't use them. On the contrary, applying battle aura is very easy.\" As he spoke, he waved his hand, and a silver battle aura appeared around his body, symbolizing Saint Battle Aura of the Martial Saint level.\n\nDimantedi said, \"Your physical condition is excellent. In terms of magic immunity, physical attack, and physical defense, you are stronger than us, only slightly inferior to the fat one.\nYour father and I have thought carefully, but we cannot determine which type of dragon you belong to. As for the application of your energy, because our dragon race has never encountered such a situation before, we have no way to teach you. Everything can only be learned through your continuous exploration. Darling. Once you have fully evolved, this current body of yours will be controlled by Nian Bing. At that time, you can enter a dormant state and properly understand the changes in your own energy. A dragon's life requires three evolutions. What we have helped you complete is only the first evolution. The latter two will depend on you. Of course, if you are designated as an heir by Lord Dragon God, and are fortunate enough to cultivate the Dragon God's Heart Secret like your father, then when the Heart Secret cultivates to the seventh layer, a fourth evolution will occur. This is our dragon race's super evolution.\"\n\n\"Mama, why must I leave you all? Why must this body be handed over to that sealed human for control?\"\n\nDimantedi reluctantly suppressed the sadness in her heart and said softly, \"Because Nian Bing's current situation is precisely due to you. Without him, you would probably have died long ago. He has sacrificed so much for our dragon race, and he granted you the hope of life. Therefore, no matter from what angle, we must help him recover. Repaying kindness is something we must do. Moreover, you won't be unable to see Mama in the future! When Nian Bing's soul is released and he regains control of his spiritual power and consciousness, the two of you will coexist within this body, with him as the dominant one. You can communicate through your souls. When you want to see Mama, just tell Nian Bing, and I believe, given his character, he absolutely will not stop you.\"\n\n\"Nian Bing\" pouted and said, \"So troublesome! Not having my own body is truly bad. If I ever meet that Evil Lord you speak of, I'll definitely kill him. Mama, what was that Dragon God's Heart Secret you just mentioned? Can Papa teach me? Didn't you say Papa is the next Dragon God? Wouldn't it be fine if he just designated me as his successor?\"\n\n\"Shh.\" Dimantedi made a shushing gesture. \"Lower your voice, if your father hears you, he'll probably scold you again. You must understand that our dragon race can never let familial affection influence the Dragon God's choice. Only if you can surpass other clan members in all aspects, and when your father knows he can no longer lead our clan, will it be possible for him to transmit the Dragon God's Heart Secret to you. That is our dragon race's supreme secret art; it is not easily transmitted. The current Lord Dragon God is your Uncle Jialamandisi's father, but because your father is more suitable to be the next Dragon God, he didn't choose your Uncle Jialamandisi. To become the Dragon God, one must maintain impartiality. Your father is the Dark Dragon King, and it's already not easy for him to gain the trust of the clan members. You must not cause him trouble. Do not say such things again in the future, especially not where your father can hear, understand?\" Although she doted on \"Nian Bing,\" when it came to major clan matters, she dared not be careless and quickly explained it clearly to \"Nian Bing.\"\n\"Nian Bing\" was stunned for a moment, secretly feeling fortunate in his heart. He had never told the Seven Dragon Kings that besides absorption, his strange gray energy also had a special ability: mind-reading. With his current strength, he naturally couldn't directly invade the Seven Dragon Kings' minds with this ability, but when the Seven Dragon Kings helped him evolve and transmitted energy and various dragon race knowledge to him, their minds were completely open, and his ability naturally came into play. The reason he hadn't said anything was because he had discovered many secrets among the Seven Dragon Kings. For example, the Spatial Dragon King Ka'aodilisi had always secretly liked the Ice Dragon King Sarisaris and had even secretly peeked at Sarisaris's underwear. For instance, the Earth Dragon King, the fat one, also liked Sarisaris, even using her as an object of sexual fantasy—he knew all such secrets crystal clear. To him, the Seven Dragon Kings held no secrets, and this naturally included the Dragon God's Heart Secret. Although \"Nian Bing\" currently only had the intelligence of a sixteen-year-old human, he also understood that unauthorized disclosure of others' secrets was absolutely a great taboo, which was why he had concealed the fact that he possessed this ability. These past two days, when the Seven Dragon Kings finished helping him evolve, he would often search through the secrets he had gained. Whenever he thought of interesting secrets within the Seven Dragon Kings' minds, he would chuckle to himself. At this moment, hearing Dimantedi say he couldn't cultivate the Dragon God's Heart Secret, further solidified his resolve not to reveal this ability. Since he already knew it anyway, there shouldn't be any harm in cultivating it secretly, right?\n\nAlthough there was a slight feeling of impropriety in his heart, \"Nian Bing\" still couldn't suppress his curiosity.\n\"Mama, don't worry. I won't say it again in the future. Anyway, this body won't be controlled by me later, so how could I say it?\"\nHearing \"Nian Bing\" say this, Dimantedi felt a slight pang in her heart, realizing her previous tone had been a bit harsh. She gently pulled \"Nian Bing\" into her embrace, quietly enjoying this moment of familial bliss.\n\nThe little Dragon King's evolution rate was truly too fast. In the end, it didn't even extend to forty-nine days. When the thirty-sixth day after his awakening arrived, the dragon power and all functions within his body had completely reached the goals anticipated by the Dragon Kings.\nDimantedi knew that the child before her was about to be replaced by a human soul; her heart ached, but there was nothing she could do.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings gathered once again deep inside the cave, surrounding \"Nian Bing\" in the center as they always did when helping him evolve. Kajia'aoxisi's face was expressionless; he tried his best to calm his emotions, but with his son before him, could he truly remain calm? It was very, very difficult.\n\n\"Child, your evolution is basically complete. Now, it's time for you to awaken Nian Bing's soul in the Heaven's Eye Acupoint. Although your energy is very strange, I can faintly sense its power. As long as you strive to break through the seal of the Heaven's Eye Acupoint, you will surely release Nian Bing's soul. From now on, you two will share this body. No matter when, you must remember that he is your benefactor, he gave you the opportunity to come into this world. Under any circumstances, you must selflessly help him, whether for him or for yourself. Only when Nian Bing becomes the true strongest, can he help you reshape your body and truly become yourself. Do you understand?\"",

    "content": "To Ka Jie'aoxisi, his stern father, Nian Bing had always felt a sense of awe. He put away his usual mischievousness, obediently nodded, and said, \"Dad, I will definitely do it. Mom already told me about this. However, can I make one request?\"\n\nKa Jie'aoxisi said gently, \"Speak. As long as I can, I will certainly fulfill you.\" How could he be displeased with his son's final request?\n\nNian Bing secretly glanced at his mother and whispered, \"After I awaken that Nian Bing, can I still drink Mom's milk?\"\n\nHey! Ka'aodilisi couldn't help but burst into laughter, but when he saw Ka Jie'aoxisi's frosty face, he quickly covered his mouth. After these experiences, he dared not provoke this elder.\n\nKa Jie'aoxisi said sternly, \"No, absolutely not. Di Man Tedi is your mother, but not Nian Bing's. Besides, you have already completed the first stage of evolution and passed your infancy, so you can't drink milk anymore.\" He could barely tolerate his son using Nian Bing's body to drink milk, but if Nian Bing were to awaken and then drink, he would absolutely not be able to endure it. Although Nian Bing could be considered their family's benefactor, the feeling of wearing a green hat¹ was definitely uncomfortable.\n\nDi Man Tedi complained, \"Lower your voice, don't scare the child.\"\n\nKa Jie'aoxisi helplessly shook his head and said, \"You just spoil him too much. Alright, let's prepare to begin. Later, the seven of us will use our own energy to protect you. Try to break the seal on the Heavenly Eye Acupoint. I've checked Nian Bing's body; the Heavenly Eye Acupoint seals his soul. But the seal isn't very strong. When you break the seal, you just need to be careful not to harm his soul. Only you can do this, because you can now be part of his body, and the Heavenly Eye Acupoint will recognize your aura. If it were our energy, it could only destroy the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, but never open it. Do you understand?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"I understand. Dad, Mom, please take care. All uncles, please take care. If I've ever done anything to displease you, please forgive me, especially Uncle Ka'aodilisi. Of course, it's okay if you don't forgive me. Anyway, it won't be easy for you to see me again in the future.\" Saying this, he bowed deeply in seven directions. Now, his mind was gradually maturing. Inheriting the genes of Ka Jie'aoxisi and Di Man Tedi, the gradually maturing him was no longer as mischievous as a month ago. With parting imminent, he had put away his playful heart, and his eyes were somewhat red.\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Di Man Tedi choked, stopping the Ten Dragon Kings, who were also red-eyed and preparing to concentrate their energy.\n\nKa Jie'aoxisi sighed lightly, \"He will leave us sooner or later. Calm your heart, I also can't bear it, but...\"\n\nDi Man Tedi sobbed, \"I'm not trying to stop it. It's just, have you forgotten that our child still doesn't have a name yet! I want to give him a name before he leaves, okay?\" At this point, she could no longer suppress the sorrow in her heart and burst into tears.\n\nThe Fire Dragon King, Ga Lamandisi, standing by, couldn't bear it and said, \"How about... we wake Nian Bing in a few days, at least until Di Man Tedi calms down.\"\n\nKa Jie'aoxisi shook his head, \"Long pain is not as good as short pain²; the longer it drags on, the harder it will be for us to part. Alright, wife, you give him this name. Whatever you name him, I agree.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at the Ten Dragon Kings and suddenly said, \"Dad, Mom, I'll decide my own name. I'll take the first, third, and fifth characters from Father's name, and then change the order. I'll be called Oscar. You can also call me Kaka Si. It's a very good name, isn't it?\"\n\nKa Jie'aoxisi's whole body trembled. He hadn't expected his son to choose such a name. Even if using parents' names, considering his closeness with himself compared to Di Man Tedi, it should have been primarily based on Di Man Tedi's name, but he chose his own instead. Ka Jie'aoxisi felt a bit perplexed in his heart, but a strange warm current had already appeared deep within him. The Space Dragon King Ka'aodilisi, always very curious, asked Ka Jie'aoxisi's unspoken question, \"Why that name? I remember Ka Jie'aoxisi often reprimanded you!\"\n\nOscar said calmly, \"No matter what, he is my dad. According to human custom, sons use their father's surname. Our Dragon race has no surname, so I'll use Dad's name.\"\n\nHe spoke very calmly, but it stirred up monstrous waves³ in Ka Jie'aoxisi's heart. Originally, he had always felt somewhat uncomfortable because his son used Nian Bing's body and clung to Di Man Tedi. Not only because of Nian Bing's body, but also because his son's appearance took away most of his wife's love. However, when he heard his son's explanation, his eyes welled up. He regretted, regretted why he hadn't been kinder to his son these past few days, and felt ashamed of that hint of jealousy in his heart.\n\nOscar flicked away the tears in his eyes. \"Alright, what are you all doing? Dad, Mom, I'm not not coming back. Didn't you say that Nian Bing guy is very good? He will definitely let me out often to see you. Alright, let's start now. Remember, from now on, call me Kaka, Oscar.\" Saying this, he closed his eyes and began to condense the special energy within his body.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings exchanged glances. Ka Jie'aoxisi took a deep breath and said, \"Good. My son has grown up. Let's begin.\"\n\nIce, fire, wind, earth, space, light, and darkness—seven distinctly different energies appeared simultaneously. The Seven Dragon Kings burned with blue, red, green, yellow, silver, white, and black light-flames. After elevating their energy to its limit, they simultaneously raised their right hands and carefully input energy into Oscar's body.\n\nReceiving the support of the Seven Dragon Kings, Oscar's whole body trembled. A layer of gray scales gradually grew on him. The shape of his scales was neither like his father, the Dark Dragon King Ka Jie'aoxisi, nor like his mother, the Light Dragon King Di Man Tedi. They were an extremely strange form, with elegant curves outlining both sides of the middle, but sharp triangles at both ends. The scales were small but extremely dense, thickly covering every part of his skin.\n\nA faint gray aura pushed the Seven Dragon Kings' energy back by an inch. Although it appeared to be pushed back, Oscar was actually still absorbing the Seven Dragon Kings' energy. Relying on the support of these energies, he stabilized his Dragon Soul, controlling his gray energy to slowly ascend, invading the brain.\n\nThe brain is the most complex part of a person. If it were one's own mental power, with just a thought, energy would naturally enter the mind along specific pathways, reaching any location under control. But now, Oscar was entering Nian Bing's brain. He knew this was the most fragile place for a human. So, although he had pre-planned the route, he was still very careful. He didn't want Nian Bing to become an idiot when his soul returned; that way, he probably wouldn't be able to contact his parents using this body anymore.\n\nGradually, following the planned route, Oscar's gray energy got closer and closer to Nian Bing's brow. Suddenly, he felt a familiar aura. Since he gained this body, the only place his energy hadn't observed was the depths of Nian Bing's brain. Now, sensing a familiar aura there, he couldn't help but be startled.\n\nOscar paused. Although a dragon's spiritual power was extremely vast, moving through the complex folds of the brain without causing any damage still consumed a great deal of his energy. After a brief respite, he continued forward, moving towards that familiar aura. He didn't have to worry about his soul losing contact with his Dragon Soul; with the strong support of the Seven Dragon Kings, even if an accident occurred, his Dragon Soul could be completely pulled back.\n\nWhen Oscar passed through layer after layer of obstruction and saw his destination, he couldn't help but be stunned. What appeared before him was a large door—the gate of the Heavenly Eye Acupoint. And at the entrance of the gate stood seven people, seven people identical to himself. They were of different colors, representing ice, fire, wind, earth, space, light, and darkness. The seven colors of light formed a special barrier, completely blocking the Heavenly Eye Acupoint's door.\n\nOscar's heart stirred. He recalled the Seven Dragon Kings describing Nian Bing's power. \"Is this his 'all-element Shadow Constructs'? That colorful energy is clearly his Heavenly Domain. How could it be here?\"\n\nBefore he could think further, the seven Shadow Constructs at the Heavenly Eye Acupoint's gate had already surrounded him. Moving so fast, the seven constructs left trails of faint afterimages. Seven completely different energies simultaneously attacked Oscar's gray energy.\n\n\"What the hell! What kind of human is this? Too abnormal! All-element energy applied so skillfully! Isn't he already dead? Why does his energy still exist, guarding this gate? Why is this?\"\n\nOscar's gray, strange energy didn't hesitate despite his confusion. It quickly condensed into a ball, protecting his soul. It was fortunate that this strange energy itself was cultivated based on ten-element energy; if it were anyone else's single-attribute soul, encountering the seven-element Shadow Constructs' attack, even a slight infringement would likely destroy it.\n\n\"So painful!\" The pain in his soul made Oscar cry out. \"I'm being kind, why are you hitting me?\" Though his energy was already very strong, he had not trained his soul. Facing these Shadow Constructs formed by unknown energy, his soul could only passively resist, with no power to retaliate whatsoever.\n\nPain. It was truly painful. The pain in his soul far exceeded physical pain. Especially the blue and red shadows; their attack power was the strongest. Every blow made Oscar inwardly convulse.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings outside were startled too, because Nian Bing's body suddenly trembled without any warning, and his face revealed an expression of extreme pain. Di Man Tedi looked at Ka Jie'aoxisi, giving him an inquiring glance, meaning to ask if they should pull their son's soul back. Ka Jie'aoxisi hesitated, but he still shook his head, because he knew that once they failed this time, success would become much more difficult in the future.\n\nBefore Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye Acupoint gate, Oscar was almost unable to resist. He also wanted to leave this place with his soul, but he was surrounded by the seven Shadow Constructs and couldn't escape. Just as Oscar felt his soul was about to collapse, suddenly, the seven Shadow Constructs stopped. Oscar found that they were all tainted with his gray aura.\n\nA flash of white light, and the Heavenly Eye Acupoint's gate actually opened automatically. Before Oscar could cheer, his soul was instantly sucked into that door. The seven Shadow Constructs, however, solidified into seven colorful luminous orbs and floated down towards Nian Bing's chest and abdomen.\n\n---\n¹ **wearing a green hat (帶綠帽子)**: An idiom meaning to be cuckolded.\n² **Long pain is not as good as short pain (長痛不如短痛)**: An idiom meaning it's better to get a difficult or painful experience over with quickly rather than prolonging it.\n³ **stirred up monstrous waves (翻起了滔天波瀾)**: An idiom meaning to cause a huge stir or strong emotional turmoil.",

    "content": "This was a transparent world; everything around him became unusually illusory. As soon as Oscar entered, he felt something was wrong, just like when he spied on the Seven Dragon Kings—it seemed as if nothing about him was mysterious anymore, everything was completely revealed in this transparent space.\n\nJust as Oscar was feeling somewhat bewildered, a surprised voice echoed in his soul, \"You, who are you? How did you get here?\"\n\nOscar was startled, saying, \"Are you that human Nian Bing? Of course, I'm here to take you out. The energy here has seen through me, wasn't that your doing?\"\n\n\"Take me out? I'm already dead, where can you take me?\" Yes, the one speaking to Oscar was indeed Nian Bing, a white soul drifting gently. The white light gradually condensed into a form, and Nian Bing appeared. His appearance in energy form was exactly the same as Oscar's. The two looked at each other, and a strange feeling arose in their hearts. It was an indescribable feeling; looking at themselves across from them, they were both a little stunned.\n\nThat day, after Nian Bing finally resisted Xie Yue's attack, his consciousness immediately fell into a state of slumber. He only felt himself drifting vaguely, unable to feel any physical pain; it was a rather comfortable feeling. Everything around him turned dark, as if a voice was calling to him. At that time, he had only one thought: *I'm dead, just like that*. Immediately after, he lost all ability to perceive. When he regained consciousness, he found himself in this space. A person can only die once in a lifetime; no one knows what it's like after death. Nian Bing only felt that he had arrived in a transparent and special world. This world seemed to have absorbed everything from his memories. This space seemed very small, yet also infinitely vast. He could only control his soul to drift within it; there was no time in this space. The feeling of loneliness gradually wore down all his thoughts. Nothing mattered anymore; he was dead, and everything in the world was irrelevant to him. Precisely because he had always believed he was dead, he let go of his mind in this illusory space and felt everything around him. His control over his soul became more proficient, and now he could easily reach any corner of this transparent space.\n\n\"Idiot, you're not dead. If you were dead, could you still talk to me? Your soul has always been alive, it hasn't dissipated.\" Oscar said to Nian Bing grumpily.\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment, looking at Oscar, who was exactly like himself, and said, \"You mean I'm not dead? Then who are you? Another me?\" His mind, which had been as calm as water these past few days, now showed ripples of fluctuation. There were still so many things waiting for him to do in his heart. How could he bear to die?\n\nOscar nodded and said, \"Of course you're not dead. Otherwise, I'd be dead too. Do you remember the red light you blocked at the last moment? You were hit by that red light onto my body. At that time, my physical body was destroyed by that hateful Evil Lord, and your spiritual power caused your soul to vanish due to a lack of life force. I am the egg you saved. My parents are the Dark Dragon King Kagiosius and the Light Dragon King Demantity. And I am that dragon egg; you can call me by my name, Oscar, or you can call me Kaka.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred; he was an extremely intelligent person, and although Oscar hadn't explained in detail, he still vaguely guessed some things. He said eagerly, \"Then I'm really not dead? What exactly happened? Please explain more clearly.\"\n\nOscar chuckled, controlling his soul to float in front of Nian Bing. Although the figure in front of him was exactly the same, he couldn't help but look at it carefully a few times. He found that Nian Bing's soul naturally emitted an energy that made him feel close. This energy was gentle and seemed very familiar. Of course, he didn't know that this was because when Demantity had a difficult labor back then, it was Nian Bing who relied on his own energy to help her have a smooth delivery, and used his Seven-Element magic power to nourish his body. It was for this reason that, even though it was his first time seeing Nian Bing, a subconscious feeling of closeness arose in his heart. \"Simply put, your current form is your own soul, and my current form is also my soul. You are human, and I am a dragon. My original body was destroyed by Xie Yue, and my soul and Dragon Spirit took the opportunity to merge into your body. Now, this human body of yours is jointly controlled by the two of us. I have repaired all your injuries and used the energy generated from the Dragon Spirit to help you transform your body. Therefore, although your body's outer appearance is human, it actually possesses the toughness of a dragon, and its abilities to resist magic and physical attacks have all increased to a dragon's level. You should understand now, right? The reason I controlled my soul to come here is to awaken your soul, take you out, and regain control of this body.\" At that moment, Oscar thoroughly explained everything that had happened in the past few days to Nian Bing, and Oscar answered every question Nian Bing asked.\n\n\"Not dead? I'm actually not dead? Hahahahaha, this is truly wonderful.\" Nian Bing, in soul form, began to dance with joy in the Celestial Eye Acupoint. What could be more fortunate than a \"dead person\" gaining new life? He was truly excited, excited to be alive again, and moreover, compared to before, he now had a dragon's body; everything was truly wonderful.\n\n\"Hey, you're not crazy, are you?\" Oscar looked at Nian Bing with some dissatisfaction.\n\nNian Bing excitedly hugged Oscar tightly. Although they were both in soul form, the touch of souls was still real and made memories even deeper. \"Thank you, thank you little dragon, I can actually live again. I knew it, how could the Seven Dragon Kings, being so powerful, let me die?\"\n\nOscar smiled wryly, \"To be frank, both you and I were just lucky. If my energy hadn't found your damaged body at that time, and if your body hadn't been repaired by my energy in time, I'm afraid both of us would have been finished. My parents, although powerful, are by no means omnipotent. I've always had a question I wanted to ask you, could you please answer it?\"\n\nNian Bing was in an extremely good mood at this moment. \"Ask away, I'll definitely answer if I know.\"\n\nOscar chuckled and said, \"When you helped my father and them with all your might back then, did you not have any selfish motives at all? Facing enemies so much stronger than you, you actually gave up your life to protect my father, them, and me. This is truly difficult for me to understand. Don't humans regard their lives as the most precious thing?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Actually, I only thought about this question carefully after arriving here. I could say that when I decided to protect you all back then, there were eight parts impulsiveness and two parts a thought of hopeful opportunism^1 in my heart. In my opinion, the Seven Dragon Kings are powerful after all, and as long as I could hold on for a bit longer, they would definitely hatch you, given the combined power of the Seven Dragon Kings! But it was mostly impulse; I was indeed very impulsive at that time. Perhaps you don't know, but ever since I was separated from my parents, I've always been a very rational person, because I know that to avenge my father, I must face everything calmly. Because my enemy is truly too powerful. Seeing your mother sacrifice her own life just to give birth to you, that great maternal love deeply moved me. Although my actions that day were for the sake of brotherhood, more importantly, they were for your mother's selfless love. I was separated from my mother since childhood and deeply know how painful it is for a child to not have a mother. I have already lost my mother, and I really didn't want you to lose her and your father right after birth. At that moment, my heart was very agitated; I suddenly felt filled with power. So, I promised the Seven Dragon Kings to protect them and let them focus on hatching you. You know what happened next; I originally thought that this impulse would still lead to an irreversible tragedy, but now it seems my luck isn't just ordinary good!\"\n\nOscar's body trembled slightly. Demantity had never told him about her pregnancy, and only from Nian Bing's mouth did he learn how much suffering his mother endured to give birth to him. This feeling was deeply engraved in his heart.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"I understand what you mean. Don't worry, this body now belongs to both of us. Whenever your parents are around, I'll let you take control of the body, and you can do whatever you like. I'll supervise you from within the body. This way, you can be active outside while I cultivate inside, and when I'm active outside, you can also cultivate inside. Isn't that great? Neither of us will waste time, and we won't have to fear being disturbed while cultivating.\" Although sharing a body with the little Dragon King Oscar had quite a few drawbacks, it was still much better than staying in this lonely space.\n\nOscar nodded and said, \"Good, you've already agreed before I even made the request. Since you're so straightforward, I won't hide anything from you either. Since the two of us simultaneously possess a single body, it can be said that our memories are interconnected. Unless we use soul energy to lock away special memories, we can understand each other at the fastest speed. When you regain control of the body, you'll definitely find many strange things added to your memories. Please, absolutely do not speak of them, because my energy is very peculiar and possesses the ability of telepathy. Therefore, I've seen many things I shouldn't have. I'll seal some of the most confidential ones with my soul; as for the rest, perhaps they'll be useful to you.\" What he wanted to seal, of course, was the Dragon God's New Arts, the most precious technique of the Dragon Race, which absolutely could not be known by others. Oscar, having grown and evolved, already understood many principles.\n\nNian Bing looked at Oscar in surprise and said, \"When I helped with your delivery back then, I already knew your energy was very strange. Can you clearly know what abilities you have now?\"\n\nOscar smiled wryly, \"No, not really. Although my energy is very strange, I haven't seen its powerful aspects yet. To be frank with you, what I can use now are just some basic attack and defense abilities of the Dragon Race, but I can't use the Dragon Race's Mimicry Magic or powerful Dragon Language Magic. So, in a sense, I'm not a qualified dragon. However, my dad and mom are the Dark Dragon King and the Light Dragon King, respectively, so I believe my strength won't be too far off. Once I figure out my own energy, I'll definitely give them a surprise. What I can do now is continuously cultivate this energy. Perhaps, when it accumulates to a certain level, its own abilities will manifest. Don't worry, although I'll be cultivating inside your body, it definitely won't affect your body. Your original energy should be in the area between your chest and abdomen, so you should continue cultivating there. I will gather my energy near your most vulnerable heart. Cultivating there won't just avoid affecting you, but also serve to protect your heart. Our souls seem to be interconnected now, so from now on, let's rely on soul connection.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Thank you, Oscar. From now on, we'll be the closest partners. Tell me, what kind of person could ever be in our situation? All right, I want to go out and see. You just said the Celestial Eye Acupoint has opened, right?\"\n\nOscar nodded and said, \"Yes, the Celestial Eye Acupoint has opened, but my soul has lost contact with the Seven Dragon Kings' energy. As long as we call upon their energy, we can be pulled out by them. At that time, you just need to overlap and fuse your soul, consciousness, and spirit, and you'll naturally be able to control this body. Remember, I'm in the area of your heart.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart suddenly stirred, because he felt familiar energy fluctuations: the seven types of auras, ice, fire, wind, earth, space, light, and darkness. Connecting this to the seven shadow puppets Oscar had encountered earlier, a flash of insight struck him, and he immediately understood something. \"Kaka, I know why you were able to come in. Your soul and Dragon Spirit being able to survive within my body must mean they've been recognized by my body. So, when you were attacked by those seven shadow puppets, they became imbued with your aura and immediately sensed that you weren't an enemy, which is why they stopped pursuing you. Yes, it must be like that. If my guess is correct, my Ice and Fire Dual Origin magic power has now come into contact with the Seven Dragon Kings' energy. Although you can't feel the Seven Dragon Kings' energy, I can. Good, let's go out together.\" Saying that, he took Oscar's hand and, through their souls, sent out a summons to the energy he was most familiar with.\n***\n^1. 原文 \"僥倖的想法\" (jiǎo xìng de xiǎng fǎ) literally means \"a thought of fluke/luck\". It conveys the sense of having a slim chance or relying on luck. \"A thought of hopeful opportunism\" is an adaptation to better convey the nuance of a calculated risk with a hopeful outcome.",

    "content": "The transparent space lightly rippled, and everything around gradually became distorted. Various lights continuously flickered within the Heavenly Eye Acupoint*, creating a flowing, colorful spectacle that was so captivating. Nian Bing sensed Oscar's energy, and similarly, Oscar sensed his. At this moment, one human and one dragon, whose souls were originally completely different, truly forged a bridge of communication between them. Through this bridge, they no longer needed to speak; with just a thought, they could let the other know what they were thinking.\n\nA light flashed in Nian Bing's eyes, and he softly shouted, \"Alright, let's go out.\" Seven-colored light burst forth from deep within his soul. The now-opened Heavenly Eye Acupoint could no longer obstruct his soul. The two souls, identical in form, transformed into one gray and one seven-colored ball of light and drifted out. Nian Bing's soul was now mostly permeated with red and blue light, surrounded by five other colors of light. From the perspective of energy control, Nian Bing was much stronger than Oscar. Relying on his perception of energy, and driven by the Seven Dragon Kings' energy as a foundation, he quickly broke free from the Heavenly Eye Acupoint's seal and moved down along the meridians.\n\nJust as their souls left the brain and entered Nian Bing's body, suddenly, Nian Bing's soul vibrated violently. Oscar's soul was automatically pushed out. Nian Bing only felt his soul expanding outwards. His familiar body, every meridian, clearly appeared before his eyes. Although his meridians had now become like crystal, that familiar feeling still profoundly shook his soul. Gradually, various perceptions returned to his heart; no longer was it a singular soul, as spiritual power and consciousness surged in, and the sensations of various energies and the feeling of his body rapidly returned.\n\nHis soul seemed to explode in an instant, diffusing into every corner of his body. Surging spiritual power instantly connected with the Heavenly Eye Acupoint at his glabella. Through the Heavenly Eye, Nian Bing saw everything around his body. The Seven Dragon Kings were anxiously watching him; the cave was still the same; the sensations of his skin and meridians continuously returned. Nian Bing found himself filled with power, not only magical power but also a tough body; it was as if every muscle within him was filled with an extraordinarily immense explosive force.\n\nWhat the Heavenly Eye Acupoint saw was no longer as blurry as before, like a true eye—no, clearer than a true eye. He could clearly grasp every subtle change in the surrounding energy. What he saw through the Heavenly Eye seemed far more vibrant in color than before. Nian Bing found himself very sensitive, extremely sensitive to any sensation; even the slightest change in energy could be easily grasped. In his chest and abdomen, the red and blue light masses rotated in the center as before, and the other five elemental magic energy spheres similarly revolved around them. With the help of the Seven Dragon Kings' energy, Nian Bing's body had fully recovered to normal; it seemed everything had returned to how it was, and yet it also seemed everything had changed. The sensation of soul and body merging again was so marvelous. Nian Bing knew he was alive again, having returned to this wonderful yet painful human world.\n\nVarious thoughts flooded in, making Nian Bing's mind a little muddled. His consciousness and newly recovered spiritual power were exploring this familiar yet strange body; his meridians hadn't expanded. But everything in his body had changed; his heart rate was one-tenth of what it used to be, only beating once every half day, and his blood flowed much slower; his meridians were filled with resilient elasticity. Now, this body was more like it was condensed from energy; wherever his spiritual power passed, he could clearly feel vast energy fluctuations. He remembered Oscar's words: a dragon's body. Yes. He now possessed a dragon's body. Oscar's soul seemed different from his; it remained condensed, just as he had said, staying around Nian Bing's heart, merging with a mass of gray liquid, enveloping the area around his heart. His brain seemed to contain many new things, including the memories of Oscar occupying his body during this period, and also the secrets of the Seven Dragon Kings that Oscar had spoken of.\n\nGalamandis grew a little anxious. Just now, their energy had clearly sensed a summons from Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye Acupoint. But when they increased the rate of their energy output, they were surprised to find that they had once again lost connection with Nian Bing's body.\n\nNian Bing stood there calmly, not moving at all. But it was precisely this calmness that made the Seven Dragon Kings particularly uneasy.\n\nKateosis frowned slightly and said, \"Don't you feel it? Nian Bing's body seems to be repelling our energy. This has never happened before.\"\n\nWind Dragon King Karodilis said, \"Indeed. Perhaps Nian Bing's soul has already been brought out from the Heavenly Eye Acupoint. His soul has been sealed in the Heavenly Eye Acupoint for so long; it must need some time to merge with his body, so we don't need to be anxious.\"\n\nDimantedi said somewhat eagerly, \"What about Kaka? Can any of you still sense his aura?\" Her greatest concern was always her child, fearing Kaka might suffer even the slightest mishap.\n\nThe Dragon Kings shook their heads. Indeed, none of them could sense Kaka's peculiar energy anymore, and they couldn't even sense the various conditions within Nian Bing's body. Just as their hearts began to feel a little uneasy, the original gray energy around Nian Bing's body disappeared. A layer of blue light covered every inch of his skin, and a cold aura appeared, as if merging with Sarsaris's energy. With a flash of blue light, the connection with the Ice Dragon King was naturally severed.\n\nThe layer of gray scales on his skin merged into his body, revealing his human skin once more. His skin looked crystal-clear, and its healthy color greatly relieved the Seven Dragon Kings. The next moment, the energy on Nian Bing's skin surface began to change, from blue to red. Galamandis felt his energy output uncontrollably increase. The next moment, a strong repulsive force appeared, bouncing the energy he had sent into Nian Bing's body out. Immediately after, the color of Nian Bing's skin surface went through a process of changing from red to green, from green to yellow, from yellow to silver, from silver to white, and from white to black. Each time the color changed, it would bounce the energy output by one Dragon King out of his body. His white hair, now a bit longer than before, floated up behind him without any wind. When it finally changed to black light, a halo of seven-colored light emanated from Nian Bing as its center—it was precisely his Heavenly Eye Domain.\n\nThe Seven Elemental Heavenly Eye Domain made all Seven Dragon Kings feel a tremor throughout their bodies simultaneously. Within this innate domain, they could only sense the magic elements corresponding to their own element, under the cover of light. Their previously lost energy rapidly replenished, and their every movement felt much lighter than usual. Amplification—yes, precisely the amplification ability of the Heavenly Eye Domain.\n\nNian Bing moved. He spread his arms wide and vigorously stretched his body; his bones emitted crisp and rapid sounds. The Heavenly Eye Domain's coverage became wider, instantly extending beyond five zhangs*, already surpassing the strongest state he could originally release. He opened his sapphire blue eyes, the clear light within them without a trace of impurity. A faint smile appeared at the corners of his lips. \"Hello everyone, I'm back. Thank you.\"\n\nWithin the Heavenly Eye Domain, it wasn't that the domain granted the Seven Dragon Kings power, but rather that it enabled them to absorb the magic elements corresponding to their own element from the air more quickly. The Seven Dragon Kings looked at the seemingly changed Nian Bing, and expressions of relief appeared in their eyes.\n\nNian Bing waved his left hand, took out a cloth garment from his Spatial Ring*, and put it on, covering his smooth skin.\n\nHis gaze swept over the Seven Dragon Kings, finally resting on Light Dragon King Dimantedi. Perhaps because Kaka was closest to Dimantedi, or perhaps because he knew from his memories that he had once consumed Dimantedi's milk*, a feeling of closeness naturally arose in his heart. \"Please don't worry. Kaka is doing very well; he's cultivating within my heart. Whenever you miss him, I'll let him out to meet you.\"\n\nThe same appearance, yet a different temperament, Dimantedi knew. The one before her was no longer her son. Her eyes slightly red-rimmed, she said, \"Nian Bing, thank you for saving all of us, and thank you even more for saving mine and Kateosis's child at the last moment.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"You don't need to thank me; it's something I did willingly. I grew up without a mother by my side, and I deeply understand the pain of a child without a mother. I never expected to come back to life. My lost vitality, with Kaka's help, is countless times stronger than before, and my body now possesses a dragon's toughness. It's I who should be thanking you.\"\n\nWith a slight smile, a faint light emerged in Nian Bing's eyes. He clasped his hands together, and the Heavenly Eye Domain naturally retracted. A faint white light emanated from his glabella. The white light seemed to solidify, forming a subtle white line. The white line curled slightly, transforming into a tiny white dot, remaining like a tattoo in the center of his glabella. If one looked closely, they would find that the dot was not truly white, but rather condensed from seven-colored light, like the light of the sun.\n\nGalamandis stepped forward and was already in front of Nian Bing. He looked deeply into Nian Bing's eyes and extended his right hand. \"Good brother, welcome back.\"\n\nNian Bing reached out and clasped his hand, feeling the warmth in Galamandis's large hand, his heart filled with genuine brotherly affection. Lowering his head, he said somewhat silently, \"I'm sorry, I couldn't protect Moda's Seal Bottle*.\"\n\nGalamandis grabbed his shoulder and said, \"You can't be blamed for this. After all, despite such a vast difference in power between you and the Lich, you persevered for so long, and you've already done far too much for us. You will always be a friend of our Dragon Race.\"\n\nHis last sentence was certainly not said lightly. With the Dragon God's approval, the Dragon Race could now treat Nian Bing as one of their own members, like a blood relative. Like the ancestors of white people*.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings gathered around, each looking at Nian Bing. Even for them, who had lived for tens of thousands of years, this was the first time they had seen a situation of one body with two souls, and they couldn't help but feel great curiosity about Nian Bing's body.\n\nNian Bing looked at the Dragon Kings and said, \"Now that Moda's Seal Bottle is lost, what are your plans?\"\n\nKateosis said, \"We have received instructions from the Dragon God. What we need to do now is wait. Around November two years from now, the Day of Ultimate Yin* will arrive, and only then will Moda's Seal Bottle be used. Therefore, from now on, we must prepare for that day. We've been too lax these past years. This gathering together is to diligently cultivate and strive to further enhance our strength to cope with the variables more than two years from now. If we fail then, it's difficult to judge what will happen. I fear even the Divine Continent* will be greatly affected.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred, and he said, \"I've always heard you say that Moda's Seal Bottle is very important. Can you tell me now what exactly is sealed within those seven bottles?\"\n\nKateosis glanced at the other Dragon Kings around them and said, \"Now that we consider you a member of the Dragon Race, and for protecting Moda's Seal Bottle, you nearly lost your life, so you should also know the secrets of these seven bottles.\" As he spoke, he raised his head and released a layer of black light. The black light instantly spread to every corner of the cave's interior, forming a powerful seal. As long as the seal remained unbroken, even a powerful being like Xie Yue outside the seal would be unable to hear the sounds within.\n\nThe other Dragon Kings dispersed around them. Kateosis pulled Nian Bing to sit down. \"This matter is of great importance; it concerns not only the Yangguang Continent* but also the entire Divine Continent. Therefore, after you know about this, you must not speak of it casually, otherwise it will bring much unnecessary trouble, and could even cause panic across this continent.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"So you're saying what's sealed within Moda's Seal Bottle must be some very powerful evil existence?\"\n\nKateosis sighed and said, \"It's understandable that you would think that. The title 'god' is easily imagined to be on the side of justice, but in reality, the victor becomes king and the defeated a bandit*. Who can truly say who is just? Nian Bing, after you hear my explanation, you will have some new understanding of this world.\"\n\nSaying this, he paused, his gaze sweeping towards the other Dragon Kings. The Dragon Kings all nodded to him. Kateosis continued, \"The world we are in, to describe it in ancient terms, is a planet. And on this planet, over sixty percent of the area is covered by vast oceans. The continents only make up forty percent. Originally, these forty percent of continents were connected.

    "content": "\"Yes, it's the God-Lost War. The gods are the God Race currently on the Continent of Gods, and 'lost' refers to the Lost Land. In fact, they were originally all humans, but due to continuous evolution and development, they formed two distinct systems. Before [number] years ago, this world's landmass was originally a single piece. The Yangguang Continent, where we currently are, is only one-third of it. The entire continent was shaped like a long strip. On the westernmost side of the continent was the Yangguang Continent, and to its east was a vast mountain range soaring into the sky. This mountain range separated the Yangguang Continent from another continent. You've also been to that mountain range—it's the Heavenly Abyss Mountain Range where Garamandis originally resided. However, the Heavenly Abyss Mountain Range you see now is merely one-third of its original size; the other two-thirds are on another continent, where the mountains are even higher and the environment far more hostile. Most terrifyingly, the entire Heavenly Abyss Mountain Range is home to various powerful demonic beasts. The strongest among them can even rival our Dragon Race; that's simply not something you humans can cross. Even Martial Saint-level experts would find it incredibly difficult to survive under a siege of demonic beasts. At that time, human development was far inferior to what it is now; they never even conceived of crossing the sea to reach the land on the other side of the mountain range.\" Nianbing said, \"So, that means the original Heavenly Abyss Mountain Range must have been the narrowest part of the entire continent.\"\n\nKajieaoxisi nodded, saying, \"Exactly. In fact, on the other side of the Heavenly Abyss Mountain Range lies the Lost Empire. The Lost Empire is called that because they were once an extremely powerful nation, also inhabited by humans. But later, an unknown natural disaster destroyed their original civilization entirely. Only after humans re-established control over the continent did they adopt that name. Bordering the Lost Empire was another powerful empire, the so-called God Empire. Among the three continents, the God Empire was the smallest in area, and its human population was far less than the other two continents. Yet, they were also the most powerful. The God Empire's environment was extremely harsh. Those who could survive there were all the strongest among humans. They called themselves 'gods,' while we referred to them as 'God-Men.' Their leaders were the so-called Main Gods. The 'gods' these people claimed to be were entirely different from the gods you invoke when casting magic spells. What you invoke are actually the purest elements between heaven and earth, whereas they, no matter how powerful, were still merely human in essence. Originally, the Lost Land had always been controlled by the God-Men of the Continent of Gods. Though those 'gods' were few in number, their power was something the Lost Land couldn't contend with. However, certain events later caused a significant change in the Lost Land. In fact, although our Dragon Race belonged to the Continent of Gods, our kin also lived on the Lost Land. For example, our Dark Dragon Race originally hailed from the Lost Land.\"\n\nEverything Kajieaoxisi said was entirely new to Nianbing. This immediately piqued his interest, and he refrained from interrupting, waiting for the Dark Dragon King to continue.\n\nKajieaoxisi continued, \"The biggest difference between the Lost Land and the Yangguang Continent lies in their races. The Yangguang Continent is entirely human-based; while there are special races like Earth Dragons, their numbers are far too small. The Lost Land, however, is completely different. There, although humans hold the dominant position through their wisdom, they are not the only intelligent beings present. Many other powerful races have established their own systems there, such as our Dragon Race, the Elf Race—adept in nature magic and naturally gifted archers—the Dwarf Race—skilled in forging and smelting—and numerous powerful demonic beasts. Frankly, the most powerful beings on the Lost Land were probably the demonic beasts. There are numerous demonic beast races, but the reason they couldn't truly thrive was because their intelligence was entirely disproportionate to their strength. Without wisdom as a backbone, how could they contend with intelligent humans? It was precisely the existence of these demonic beasts that prompted the Lost Land's three major races—humans, elves, and dwarves—to forge the firmest alliance. They continuously fought against the demonic beasts, driving them into the continent's more remote regions. After countless years of development, the Lost Empire on the Lost Land gradually grew stronger. They also became increasingly unwilling to submit to the rule of the 'gods' on the Continent of Gods. After all, who desires to be enslaved? The humans of the Lost Land were extraordinarily intelligent. They somehow uncovered a small fragment of ancient civilization left behind. Leveraging this civilization, the Lost Empire secretly began to gradually grow stronger, eventually reaching a point where it could even contend with the God Empire.\"\n\nNianbing couldn't help but ask curiously, \"What exactly did they find? And what did they do?\" Although Nianbing had no concrete concept of 'gods,' in his mind, those 'gods' should at least be beings like the Seven Dragon Kings. If an empire were entirely composed of such powerful individuals, how could ordinary humans possibly contend with them? It was utterly inconceivable.\n\nKajieaoxisi, sensing Nianbing's doubt, smiled faintly and said, \"Actually, you needn't imagine the God Empire as *too* powerful. Like our Dragon Race, we are already a formidable race on the Continent of Gods. Our Dragon God, the Great One, is even one of the eight Main Gods of the Continent of Gods. While we may not be the strongest, we aren't far off either. Simply put, the average God-Man in the God Empire possessed strength roughly equivalent to your human Fighters. They, too, experienced birth, aging, sickness, and death, merely being stronger than your common humans—not as terrifying as you imagine. Only Main Gods could achieve eternal life through their immense power. Of course, our Dragon Race was an exception, as our inherent long lifespans were already sufficient. Each generation of Dragon God would typically enter senescence around thirty thousand years of age, while the next Dragon God would inherit the position at around twenty thousand years old. However, just imagine: when even the weakest among them could achieve the strength of a Fighter, it was already extremely difficult for ordinary humans to contend with them. The Lost Empire found a method to contend precisely because they grew powerful by leveraging their numerical advantage. Through the prehistoric civilization they unearthed, they implemented various optimizations, involving intermarriage between humans and other races, and even the fusion of human and demonic beast crystal cores, which astonishingly allowed humans to evolve into New Humans.\"\n\n\"New Humans?\" Nianbing's eyes widened in astonishment.\n\nKajieaoxisi glanced at his heart and gave a bitter smile. \"In a sense, your current situation is actually more akin to a New Human. The only difference between you and the New Humans of the Lost Land is that you possess two souls within your body. Just imagine: if human wisdom were combined with the strengths of other races, fusing them together, it would inevitably make the entire race powerful. From the day the New Humans were born, the Lost Land gradually prospered. However, fearing the Continent of Gods would discover their secret, they gathered all New Humans for training. The Continent of Gods' power was, after all, too immense. To contend with them, they had to wait and enhance themselves over time. However, as the number of New Humans grew, the secret ultimately couldn't be kept entirely. The Continent of Gods eventually learned of the Lost Empire's situation. Unfortunately, those arrogant 'gods' did not immediately take action. In their minds, even if humans had evolved somewhat, they could never contend with the entire Continent of Gods, especially the powerful Main Gods. The power each of them wielded was unimaginable to ordinary humans. Thus, while they did take notice, they merely ordered the Lost Land to cease its research into New Humans, taking no actual steps. Of course, don't assume those 'gods' were foolish; they were actually looking out for their own interests. After all, while the Continent of Gods was habitable, its conditions were exceedingly harsh. Many goods for pleasure and consumption were supplied by the Lost Land. The 'gods' there simply viewed the Lost Empire as their personal granary. Consequently, they didn't press too hard. However, how could these 'gods' possibly know the true extent of the Lost Empire's New Human development? They not only cultivated New Humans but also secretly trained a contingent of New Human top-tier experts, whom the Lost Empire itself called Lost Warriors. These warriors' innate strength could all reach the Martial Saint level. Every single one of them was a result of combining with powerful demonic beast crystal cores, then continuously cultivating. Their strength increased at an astonishing pace.\"\n\nNianbing asked, \"So, that means the Lost Land exploited the Continent of Gods' negligence and launched a war against them?\"\n\nKajieaoxisi shook his head. \"No. Emperor Luther of the Lost Empire was an incredibly wise man. Not only did he refrain from exploiting the Continent of Gods' negligence to launch an attack, he even proactively confessed to the God Empire and, on the surface, halted the development of New Humans. He knew that, given their current strength, they were still unable to contend with the God Empire. However, the superficial halt merely intensified the underground cultivation. The three races—humans, dwarves, and elves—all toiled for the belief in freedom. Under their concerted efforts, a millennium later, when Emperor Luther XVII ascended the throne, the Lost Empire finally believed the time was ripe. They utilized various advantageous terrains to organize a vast New Human army, quietly advancing towards the God Empire.\n\nAt this point, Kajieaoxisi sighed. \"If events had unfolded normally, perhaps the Lost Empire would have ultimately achieved victory. After all, that New Human army comprised all the elites of the Lost Empire. Regrettably, the Lost Empire still failed—it failed at the hands of a schemer. This schemer was the then-chancellor of the Lost Empire, named Kardan. He betrayed Emperor Luther XVII. After the New Human army had already set forth, he used a special method to secretly report to the God Empire, enabling the God Empire to prepare in advance and execute a counter-ambush against the New Human army.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a profound sadness flickered in Kajieaoxisi's eyes, as if he were once again reliving that world-shattering battle from ten millennia ago. \"The eight Main Gods simultaneously launched a surprise attack on the Lost Empire's New Human army. They jointly unleashed their most powerful Forbidden Spell. Perhaps your understanding of Forbidden Spells extends only to eleventh-tier magic. But I can tell you, on the other two continents, while eleventh-tier magic is certainly powerful, it would *never* be called a Forbidden Spell. True Forbidden Spells are capable of moving mountains and filling seas. Can you even guess the outcome when the eight Main Gods attacked with their full might? I fear you cannot possibly imagine it. The outcome at that time was devastating casualties for the New Human army. Furthermore, the connection point between the entire Lost Land and the Continent of Gods was jointly destroyed by eight super-Forbidden Spells of up to seventeenth-tier, causing immense geological changes. The Continent of Gods consequently separated from the original unified landmass. The Continent of Gods' environment was already harsh, and with prior preparations, all the God-Men had already gathered on the other side of the continent. However, the Lost Empire suffered a devastating blow. The powerful Forbidden Spells not only annihilated over half of the New Human army's strength but also brought catastrophe upon the entire Lost Empire. At least two-thirds of the living beings in the eastern part of the Lost Land perished due to the volcanic eruptions and tsunamis triggered by the continent's splitting. The Lost Empire was filled with lamentation, and corpses were visible everywhere. A once powerful empire suddenly crumbled, its national strength plummeting to less than half of its original capacity. Kardan had already fled after his betrayal, and the Lost Empire plunged into chaos. Fortunately, however, the colossal tsunami obstructed the Continent of Gods' counterattack, granting the Lost Land a brief period to recover. Those ten years could be considered the Lost Empire's most challenging decade, yet simultaneously the Lost Empire's most unified decade. During those ten years, everyone in the Lost Empire knew that once the tsunami subsided, once the harsh natural environment recovered, they would inevitably face a devastating blow from the God Empire. For their own survival, for the survival of their descendants, every person in the Lost Empire desperately fulfilled their mission. They worked tirelessly, warriors underwent arduous training, and every individual in the entire empire pursued New Human evolution. In just ten short years, the Lost Empire astonishingly recovered eighty percent of its peak national strength—a true miracle. Ten years later, when everything had settled, the 'gods' of the God Empire finally arrived. This time, to utterly annihilate the land that dared to resist them, the God Empire not only brought seven Main Gods but also over eighty percent of its total strength. They no longer wished to continue living on the Continent of Gods. While its environment could forge powerful humans, it also reduced their fertility to a minimum. Their sole purpose in coming to the Lost Empire was to occupy it—to achieve complete dominion. For anyone who dared to resist, there was but one word: 'Kill.'\"",

    "content": "As soon as the word \"kill\" was uttered, a vast murderous aura erupted from Ka Jiao Xi Si. His eyes flickered with blood-red light, filled with intense hatred. Di Man Te Di hurriedly stepped forward and took his hand, and only then did the Dark Dragon King's mood gradually calm down.\n\nNian Bing sighed softly, saying, \"That must have been an even more severe disaster than a tsunami, right?\"\n\nKa Jiao Xi Si nodded, saying, \"Indeed, that was a disaster even more severe than a tsunami. The Lost Empire did not compromise. Years of forbearance had filled them with a yearning for freedom; they were absolutely unwilling to be enslaved again. Therefore, they could only resist. For themselves and for their descendants, they resisted desperately. Every single person, even when they lost their last shred of life force, only their bodies gave up; their souls remained full of unwavering resolve. Nian Bing, do you know? That day, I saw the shadows of the Lost Warriors of the Lost Empire in you. You were just like them back then, willing to sacrifice everything for your goal.\"\n\nNian Bing sighed, saying, \"What was the final outcome? Did the Lost Empire still lose?\"\n\nA hint of pride appeared in Ka Jiao Xi Si's eyes. \"No, quite the opposite. Not only did the Lost Empire not lose, they defeated their enemies and achieved final victory, utterly defeating the Divine Empire. Four of the Seven Archgods perished on the lands of the Lost Empire, ninety percent of the Divine Beings they brought left their lives behind, and the population of the Lost Empire also sharply decreased by sixty percent. That was no longer a battle between humans; it had escalated to a death struggle between races. It was entirely a battle for belief: one side sought freedom, while the other desired dominion. Lu Se Shi Qi Shi once said that even if the Lost Continent fought until only one person remained, they would never yield to the Divine Continent. It was precisely under the influence of this belief that they won; the Lost Nation won this God-Forgotten War, the deadliest in history.\"\n\nHearing this, Nian Bing's heart trembled slightly. A continent with an area similar to the Sunshine Continent had actually decreased its population by sixty percent! How many people must have died! This was almost unimaginable; scenes of corpses strewn across the land constantly flickered in his mind.\n\nKa Jiao Xi Si's excitement quickly faded. \"Unfortunately, the Lost Empire's victory was achieved by relying on numerical superiority. After the three remaining Archgods of the Divine Empire returned in utter defeat, how could they be reconciled? Thus, a scene of catastrophe unfolded. Back then, when attacking the Lost Continent, the only Archgod who did not participate was our Dragon God, and our Dragon Race also did not participate. Because the Dragon God did not wish for kinsmen to slaughter each other. However, with the gods of the Divine Continent suffering such a crushing defeat, even if the Dragon God was unwilling, he had to step forward. At that time, the Dragon God had actually only taken over the position of Dragon God for a mere hundred years, and in terms of strength, he was originally the weakest among the Eight Archgods. To retaliate, the three Archgods who returned from the Lost Continent devised a terrifying method. They gathered all the remaining Divine Beings on the Divine Continent, concentrated their energy using an extremely special method, and then, at the cost of the three Archgods' lives, unleashed an unprecedented magic. This magic was also called the strongest forbidden spell by us, and it was the only eighteenth-tier forbidden spell ever to appear in our world. No one knows where the incantation for that forbidden spell came from, but I deeply remember the horrifying scene at that time. An eighteenth-tier forbidden spell! The name of that forbidden spell was 'Summoning of Time and Space.' To be precise, it should belong to spatial magic, but it was already beyond what spatial magic could describe. The entire Lost Continent, under the effect of that forbidden spell, was completely controlled. A massive space-time rift opened, sealing the Lost Continent into another world, another unknown world. Can you imagine that?\"\n\n\"Another world? Another time-space? An entire continent? My Heavens! What exactly was that?\" Nian Bing couldn't imagine it. Anyone who hadn't experienced the God-Forgotten War probably couldn't.\n\n\"After the sealing, the Summoning of Time and Space left behind seven imprints, seven imprints encompassing the entire Lost Continent. These seven imprints were sealed within seven bottles, which are the Mo Ao Da Si Sealing Bottles. Mo Ao Da Si means 'demon' in ancient language. This name was given by the gods of the Divine Continent, meaning 'bottles that seal demons.' However, what was a demon in their eyes also contained humans. The Lost Continent was sealed in another time-space. At that time, the entire Lost Empire, led by Lu Se Shi Qi Shi, was filled with resentment. They gathered all their remaining strongest mages to unleash a supreme seventeenth-tier forbidden spell, leaving a sliver of hope for themselves. With that forbidden spell, they used a method of cursing to leave their mark within the Summoning of Time and Space, forcibly imprinting this mark onto the seven Mo Ao Da Si Sealing Bottles. This prevented these seven bottles from being taken to the Divine Continent for sealing, leaving them instead on the Sunshine Continent. We, the Seven Dragon Kings, have been left here to guard these seven bottles ever since.\"\n\nNian Bing could never have imagined that the Mo Ao Da Si Sealing Bottles involved an entire continent, a continent that once existed. He was stunned, his vacant eyes as if seeing the resentment left behind by the Lost Continent.\n\nThe Dark Dragon King, Ka Jiao Xi Si, sighed, saying, \"Are you very curious as to why I, originally belonging to the Lost Empire's side, have now joined the Divine Continent? In truth, before the Lost Empire was sealed, our Dark Dragon Race and some other dragon races belonging to the Lost Empire all received the Dragon God's care. He took us in on the grounds of kinship and forcibly made us leave the Lost Nation. Otherwise, I might have also disappeared along with the Lost Nation by now.\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment, then said, \"So, you're saying those so-called gods are the evil side, and the Lost Nation was the righteous one?\"\n\nJia La Man Di Si, who had been silent all this time, spoke up. \"What is justice? What is evil? Whoever has the bigger fist is righteous. By sealing the Lost Empire, the gods of the Divine Continent naturally became righteous. If you think their enslavement of the Lost Empire was wrong, then was it righteous for the Lost Empire to experiment with real humans for New Human evolution in order to resist them? There is no true boundary between justice and evil. Ka Jiao Xi Si originally belonged to the Lost Empire, so when he describes the situation then, you naturally feel that the Lost Empire is the side worthy of pity. But if the story were told by me, it could well be said that the gods of the Divine Continent sacrificed themselves to seal away those evil humans in order to save the world.\"\n\nKa Jiao Xi Si nodded, saying, \"Indeed, with different beliefs, understanding will naturally differ. Ten thousand years have passed, and I've also come to terms with it. That's why I guard the Mo Ao Da Si Sealing Bottles, precisely because I don't want the Lost Empire to return and cause another human catastrophe. Perhaps they will live better in another space. Let me continue. At that time, Lu Se Shi Qi Shi, when commanding all mages to leave a mark using the ancestral curse method at the last moment, once said that if anyone could open the seals of the seven bottles and allow the Lost Continent to return to this world, then the Lost Continent would recognize them as its master and be at their beck and call. This is also why that Evil Lord wants to snatch the Mo Ao Da Si Sealing Bottles. Ten thousand years have passed, and Heaven knows what state the Lost Continent has developed to; at the very least, it won't be inferior to the Divine Continent. If they were truly controlled by an ambitious schemer like the Evil Lord, then a world war would likely erupt, and that would be another catastrophe for humanity. Our Dragon Race absolutely does not wish to see such a situation occur. Therefore, we must stop it with all our might. With the Mo Ao Da Si Sealing Bottles stolen this time, it will likely cause a great stir on the Divine Continent as well. Those gods who have been cultivating in slumber should wake up. Since that battle ten thousand years ago, until now, the Divine Continent has not yet recovered its original population. What I've told you today is a top secret, even on the Divine Continent. You might also know that some powerful individuals on the Sunshine Continent who reach a certain level of strength are absorbed into the Divine Continent. After they arrive on that continent, the first thing they must do is undergo brainwashing, be instilled with divine ideology, and become completely loyal to the gods. Thinking about it, I find it laughable; they are clearly all humans, yet they insist on creating so many complexities. Alright, I've now explained the course of events very clearly to you. Two years from now, regardless of whether the seals of the Mo Ao Da Si Sealing Bottles can be opened, it will likely bring about great chaos. How to choose is up to you. I'll give you my most impartial advice: I hope you can stay away from this and not get involved, otherwise, it will certainly bring you great trouble. I heard Jia La Man Di Si say that your greatest wish is revenge. This is an extraordinary time, and if you are willing, we can help you.\"\n\nHearing this, Nian Bing's whole body trembled involuntarily. If the Seven Dragon Kings were willing to help him get revenge, what was the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess? A glimmer of excitement appeared in his eyes. However, this excitement lasted only an instant. After a moment of silence, Nian Bing shook his head, saying, \"No, it's not necessary. I'd rather solve my own problems myself. All this time, hatred has always been the driving force pushing me forward. If that driving force were gone, perhaps I would become decadent. I must rely on my own strength to find the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess. Regardless of whether my parents are still alive, I must defeat her myself.\"\n\nJia La Man Di Si frowned, saying, \"Do you think you can do that in a short time?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head, saying, \"I don't know. However, if my parents are truly dead, then I will spare no cost. Perhaps I'm not strong enough now, but if I can become a little stronger and reach the realm of an Archmage, with the magic of 'Curse of Life,' I'd at least have some confidence in taking the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess down with me.\"\n\n\"No, absolutely not.\" Di Man Te Di said anxiously. \"Do your parents wish for you to die for their revenge? That would only make them sadder. Therefore, you must live well. The magic of 'Curse of Life' is very dangerous. Although you now have Kaka's powerful life force as a guarantee, that magic is very wicked. No one knows what will happen if you use it again.\"\n\nHearing the name Kaka, Nian Bing suddenly realized something and sighed softly, saying, \"Auntie, may I call you that? Kaka and I now share this body, so I'll call you Auntie. I was too impulsive. Please rest assured, I will protect my body well, for my parents, and also for Kaka.\"\n\nJia La Man Di Si said, \"Nian Bing, you've been here for forty days now. What are your plans for the future? Are you going to find your wife?\"\n\nA wry smile appeared on Nian Bing's face as he said, \"No, I won't go look for her for now. I need to make a trip to the Ice Moon Empire. I recently received news that my parents might not be dead, and I want to investigate this matter. At the same time, I also want to go back to Ice and Snow City to see some friends.\"\n\nAs soon as he heard the words \"Ice and Snow City,\" Jia La Man Di Si's eyes immediately lit up. \"Good, that's excellent! I'll go with you. If the two of us are together, even if we encounter the Evil Lord's group, at least fleeing won't be a problem. Besides, he's currently afraid of being discovered by us, so he must be hiding somewhere.\"\n\nThe Fatty beside him chuckled, saying, \"The Old Fire Dragon is feeling amorous.¹\"\n\nNian Bing was startled, looked at the Fatty, then at Jia La Man Di Si, whose expression was a bit odd, and said, \"What's going on?\"\n\nJia La Man Di Si, seeing Nian Bing's and the other Dragon Kings' questioning gazes, angrily said to the Fatty, \"Don't talk nonsense! I have proper business there too. Alright, enough talk. Nian Bing, you've just regained control of your body. Rest for two days, and I'll accompany you to Ice and Snow City. Boss Ka Jiao Xi Si, you all continue to cultivate diligently. Just consider it me protecting your son.\"\n\nThe Fatty's eyes lit up as he said, \"I'll go too! Having one more of us will be safer.\" Nian Bing's cuisine was what he longed for the most.\n\nDi Man Te Di hesitated. How could she not want to stay by Nian Bing's side?\n\nKa Jiao Xi Si hesitated, then said, \"Let Jia La Man Di Si go. The others stay here and cultivate.\" Seeing his wife's disappointed expression, he sighed inwardly. The reason he didn't let Di Man Te Di go was because he feared her strong maternal love would bring Nian Bing more trouble. Even Di Man Te Di had been refused, so the Fatty also found it difficult to say anything more and sheepishly shut his mouth.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, saying, \"Auntie, please rest assured. Once I've dealt with my own matters, I'll definitely let you see him often. Kaka currently seems to have entered a peculiar cultivation state in my heart region. This state will likely last for a while. Please rest assured, now I am him, and he is me. I will certainly protect him well and no longer let him suffer any harm.\"\n\n---\n¹ \"春心動了\" (chūnxīn dòng le): Literally \"spring heart moved.\" An idiom meaning to feel amorous, to be stirred by romantic feelings, or to fall in love.",

    "content": "Three days later, above the Cold Ridge.\n\n\"Alright, you can talk now.\" Nian Bing finally asked the question he had in his heart. After three days of meditation, he had completely mastered his body. Its toughness greatly surprised him; after all, it was a dragon's physique! Now, even without using magic, a casual punch from him could bore a hole in solid rock. His tough body also made him immune to spells below the ninth-tier. Without the strength of an Archmage, it was simply not enough to threaten him.\n\nGalamandis said, a little awkwardly, \"I've fallen for a girl, and she's in Ice and Snow City. Nian Bing! For my sake as your elder brother, you must help me when the time comes! I see you're quite good at chasing girls; teach me. Although I've lived for so many years, I really have no experience in this area.\"\n\nNian Bing stared at him, dumbfounded, and said, \"So what Fatty said was true. But are you telling me you've fallen for a human girl? Is that possible? Can dragons and humans mate? Humans only live for a hundred years, but you're an old immortal. Aren't you afraid you'll be sad when your wife dies? Moreover, your dragon physiology is quite different from humans, isn't it? Even if you can turn into a human form, it'd be troublesome if something went wrong after mating.\"\n\nGalamandis snorted and said, \"I knew you'd say that, but don't forget, I am the great Fire Dragon King Galamandis! With my strength, can't I handle these issues? Since we Dragon Kings can transform into humans, we can naturally adjust our own energy to make our physical structure exactly like that of humans. As for the age you mentioned, that's even less of a problem. Think about it. With my strength, if I properly cultivate my woman, as long as she's willing to work hard, reaching those so-called 'god-human' realms isn't difficult at all. Longevity is simply not an issue.\"\n\nSeeing Galamandis' serious expression, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a little like laughing. \"It seems you're serious this time. But I thought you liked Aunt Dimantidi, the Light Dragon King!\"\n\nGalamandis' face reddened. He said, \"That's ancient history now[^1]. She already has children now, what am I still clinging to? I'm not that persistent; I need to consider my own happiness.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled and said, \"So, this human girl is still very attractive to you this time. Otherwise, you wouldn't be this serious. I really want to see what kind of girl can move your heart so much. How do you want me to help you?\"\n\nGalamandis seemed a little shy, and smiled wryly, \"How would I know how you can help me win her over? You name it, I'll agree to any condition.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled and said, \"You said that, no going back on your word later[^2]. Alright, first tell me how you met and what happened between you. Only then can I give you advice. From the looks of it, you must have hit a lot of walls[^3] with her, right?\"\n\nGalamandis smiled wryly, \"You're right. To think I'm the great Fire Dragon King, yet I'm completely helpless with this girl. Nian Bing, you really must help me out. Initially, I met her in Ice and Snow City. The first time I saw her, I didn't have any special feelings; I just thought this human girl was very beautiful. At that time, I saw a human man desperately pleading with her about something. When I got closer and listened, it turned out the man was asking her for another chance. The man's tone was extremely weak, sounding like a coward. I found it quite interesting, so I kept listening. And guess what? When the man annoyed the girl enough, she actually slapped him right on the street! I was stunned then, so ruthless! That was a solid slap, so much so that several of the man's teeth were knocked out. Then she turned and left, as if she hadn't even struck him. The man lay on the ground for a long time before scrambling up; you can imagine how pathetic he looked. At that point, I became interested in this girl. Her feisty spirit when hitting someone was particularly appealing to me.\"\n\nNian Bing stared at Galamandis, dumbfounded, and said, \"I say, boss, you don't have masochistic tendencies, do you? You like that kind of girl? I truly admire you.\"\n\nGalamandis said, a little embarrassed, \"I don't know what's wrong with me. Matters of the heart are not something reason can control. I secretly followed her and found an opportunity to bump into her. And guess what? She roared, asking me, 'Are you blind?' Then she raised her hand and hit me with a whip. You know, with my body's toughness, that whip couldn't possibly hurt me. But when has I, the great Fire Dragon King, ever suffered such an indignity? She hit me, and I even had the power to kill her. But for some reason, I just couldn't get angry in front of her. I just stared blankly as she left. Since then, I've tried to see her every day, constantly appearing before her, but she treats me like a bothersome fly. Oh, I've never experienced such a great setback in my life! Nian Bing, you really must help me.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled wryly, \"You're truly unique. As expected of a dragon, you really think differently from humans. What do you do every day when you see her? Do you just watch her, and let her hit you? Have you expressed anything to her?\"\n\n\"Yes! Of course. I stopped her several times and said to her, 'Miss, how about we be friends?' In response, she immediately raised her hand and hit me. Fortunately, I'm quite resilient to hits. If it were an ordinary human, they probably would have been seriously injured by her already.\"\n\nNian Bing was sweating inwardly[^4]! \"Alright, you're really something. With the way you talk, how could she possibly be friends with you?\"\n\nGalamandis said, \"How would I understand your human rules? But I also said other things to her. I asked her what it would take for her to like me. She said she detests bothersome flies, and she likes men with a masculine aura. I then asked her, 'What exactly constitutes a masculine aura?' She said, 'The most important aspect of a masculine aura is demonstrated through strength.' If I could defeat someone she designated, she would consider being friends with me. So, I went with her to a place called the Warrior's Guild, and fought their Guild Master there. Don't get me wrong, that human old man had some skills; he could barely be considered a Martial Saint. It even took me one punch to send him flying. But I merely sealed his Dou Qi; I didn't injure him. Because we dragons cannot casually harm humans. However, the girl was just stunned for a moment, then immediately asked me, 'You must know this Guild Master, right? You're trying to trick me. Get lost.' I was so wronged then[^5]! How would I casually know a human? But no matter how I explained, she wouldn't believe me. She even hit me a few times, then turned around and stomped off angrily. After that, I ran into Fatty, and because the situation with Dimantidi was urgent, I didn't dare delay and rushed here to the Cold Ridge. That's how things are. Nian Bing, teach me what to do. Why did I clearly defeat that human, but she still wouldn't acknowledge me?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled wryly, \"It's no wonder she didn't acknowledge you, boss. Don't you think about it? What kind of strength does it take to defeat a Martial Saint with one punch? Who would guess you're that terrifying? That girl naturally wouldn't believe you possessed such strong power. Of course, she'd think you teamed up with the Warrior's Guild Master to trick her. But you're really something; who did the Warrior's Guild Master ever offend to get entangled with a jinx[^6] like you? What's that girl's name? Since I've stayed in Ice and Snow City for a while, maybe I'll have some clues. Once we get there, I'll help you figure something out. That's not how you chase girls.\" Actually, he himself didn't know how to chase girls. Relying on his outstanding looks and his status as a magician, ever since he entered the continent, girls had always flocked around him. When he finally chose Feng Nu, they were already deeply in love, so there was no real 'chasing' involved.\n\nGalamandis lowered his head and said, \"I... I don't even know her name.\"\n\nNian Bing, who was currently flying, nearly fell out of the sky. \"What?! You've been chasing her for ages and you don't even know her name? You're really something, boss! I'm utterly impressed with you[^7]. Does she have any distinctive features?\"\n\nGalamandis thought for a moment and said, \"She prefers to wear red clothes, which is my favorite color. Her family runs a restaurant, and the food they made back then was indeed very tasty. I think I heard others refer to her as 'Crazy Girl' when discussing her.\"\n\nSilence. Nian Bing stared blankly ahead, the whistling cold wind continuously blowing past him. Of course, he knew who Galamandis was talking about. Crazy Girl, wasn't 'Crazy Girl' Xue Jing? He had never imagined that Galamandis' object of affection would be Xue Jing from the Clear Wind Restaurant. How could it be such a coincidence? The wry smile on Nian Bing's face deepened, and he sighed helplessly. Over the years, what needs to be faced still needs to be faced! Originally, what he feared most about returning to Ice and Snow City this time was seeing Xue Jing. But with Galamandis involved, avoiding her might be impossible.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing remain silent, Galamandis couldn't help but ask anxiously, \"What's wrong? Is there no hope for me at all?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"I can't say for sure about that. However, I do indeed know the girl you're talking about. Her name is Xue Jing. You could say we're old friends.\"\n\nGalamandis said joyfully, \"That's great! With you to bridge the gap[^8], it'll be much easier for me to pursue her.\"\n\nNian Bing let out a bitter laugh and said, \"That's just what you think. Whether Xue Jing still considers me a friend is another matter entirely. Do you want to hear the story between her and me? To be honest[^9], I really wronged her back then!\"\n\nGalamandis' brow furrowed slightly and he said, \"You little brat, don't tell me you like her too? You should know, one must not covet a friend's wife[^10]!\"\n\nNian Bing rolled his eyes and said, \"Oh, please. When I knew her, you didn't even know where you were sleeping. It happened like this...\" He then began from his departure from the Peach Blossom Forest, thoroughly recounting how he entered Ice and Snow City, joined the Clear Wind Restaurant, and everything that happened between him and Xue Jing.\n\n\"Holy moly[^11], such a good girl, and you actually deceived her and drove her away, Nian Bing, I'm going to kill you!\" Galamandis gestured threateningly at Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing smiled wryly, \"Boss, you have to think about me too. I carry a deep blood feud. Back then, I had no idea what my future held, and even now, I still don't. How could I accept her feelings? What's more, Xue Jing herself isn't my type. I couldn't force myself to accept someone I don't like, could I? Since that's the case, I certainly couldn't delay her. Cutting off her hopes early was absolutely the right choice. I say, boss, don't you like her? If I had accepted her back then, where would you have had a chance? Although Xue Jing has a bit of a temper, she's a good girl. If you truly like her, I'll try my best to help you. Sigh, but it might be a bit difficult! I wonder if the resentment in her heart has disappeared over this time.\"\n\nGalamandis laughed, \"Alright, you've made a good point. Indeed, if you had taken her back then, I wouldn't have had a chance. It's good that it turned out this way. Nian Bing, you really must help me a lot! Quick, tell me, what does she like? Why did she fall for a kid like you back then? Was it just because you're a bit handsome? But you don't seem as handsome as me!\"\n\nNian Bing glared at Galamandis irritably and said, \"No wonder there are no cows below, you must have blown them all away[^12]. Are you really handsome? If you were, would you have been beaten into a pig's head by her?\"\n\n\"Bullshit, I'm a dragon! Don't compare me to a low-level creature like a pig!\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Actually, I don't know what Xue Jing likes either. Perhaps she liked me back then because of my cooking skills. If you're willing to become my disciple, I could teach you my cooking skills. As long as you can get a job at the Clear Wind Restaurant, won't you have plenty of opportunities?\"\n\nGalamandis' eyes lit up, but he quickly slumped and said, \"Forget it, I don't know how long it would take to learn cooking, and I can't wait that long, Nian Bing! Help me come up with an easier solution.\"\n\nNian Bing sighed and said, \"I knew you wouldn't be willing to learn. Let's talk about it when we get to Ice and Snow City. Xue Jing must have changed a bit over this period of time. Who knows what kind of person she likes now?\"\n\n---\n[^1]: **老黃曆 (lǎo huánglì):** Literally \"old almanac,\" meaning \"old news\" or \"ancient history.\"\n[^2]: **這可是你說地，到時候不許反悔 (zhè kěshì nǐ shuō de, dàoshíhou bù xǔ fǎnghuǐ):** Literally \"You said it, don't go back on your word then,\" an idiom meaning \"You made a promise, no backing out later.\"\n[^3]: **碰了不少釘子 (pèng le bù shǎo dīngzi):** Literally \"hit many nails,\" meaning \"encountered many rejections or obstacles.\"\n[^4]: **心中這個汗啊!

    "content": "Galamandis chuckled, saying, \"Then I'll entrust this matter to you. I will definitely cooperate well with you.\"\n\nTwo figures cut through the sky, leaving Cold Ridge and heading north.\n\nIce and Snow City was still the same as before. The war in the south could not affect this second-largest city of the Far North Empire. The city gates were open, and pedestrians bustled about, presenting a scene of prosperity.\n\nNianbing and Galamandis landed in a secluded spot ten li away. At this point, they had already reached the city gate of Ice and Snow City. Seeing Ice and Snow City again, Nianbing couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion. A little over a year ago, when he came here, he was just an ordinary magician, but today, a little over a year later, his magic was already sufficient to contend with experts of the Archmage level. How fast time flew! In the blink of an eye, more than a year had passed. He wondered how Ling'er was doing after she returned. Had she been waiting for him all this time?\n\n\"Hurry up! Let's go in quickly and eat at Clear Wind Pavilion.\" Galamandis urged. These past two days, he had complained that Nianbing flew too slowly, so he personally carried him, flying across more than half of the Ice Moon Empire to get here. The thought of seeing Xue Jing soon made his heart involuntarily warm up. Suppressed for ten thousand years, once his emotions erupted, they were much hotter than a volcano.\n\nNianbing smiled slightly, saying, \"No hurry, it's not time to eat yet, is it? We'll just walk over. Boss Galamandis, you must always remember, this is a human place, so don't casually display your great abilities.\"\n\nGalamandis snorted, saying, \"Alright, I get it. Nianbing kid, let's go.\"\n\nThe two walked through the city gate into the city. Having lived here for several months, Nianbing was quite familiar with the city. Almost all places were the same as when he left. There weren't many changes. The familiar storefronts and familiar street made Nianbing feel a bit immersed. He remembered the Water Goods Ironware Shop, where he got his first divine blade, and also where he met his beloved Feng Nü. He wondered how Feng Nü was doing. She must have already reunited with Gan Ma, right? Perhaps they had already gone to the Phoenix Clan together. With Gan Ma by Feng Nü's side, coupled with Feng Nü's own strength, there was no need to worry about her safety.\n\nAs they walked, a sudden rush of hoofbeats came from the side of the road. Nianbing looked intently, only to see a team of brightly armored knights swiftly heading deeper into Ice and Snow City. He couldn't help but be surprised. He had lived there for so long and never saw soldiers galloping through the city. What was going on? Had something happened in Ice and Snow City? Thinking this, he stopped a passerby by the road and asked, \"Hello, what was that cavalry squad doing just now? They're riding so fast in the city. Aren't they afraid of causing danger?\"\n\nThe passerby whispered, \"Don't be a busybody. Ice and Snow City hasn't been peaceful lately. Ever since the finance minister ran away more than two months ago, Ice and Snow City has been in chaos. Miss Wisdom Woman was the Fifth Prince's fiancée, and this time she mysteriously ran away in secret. After His Majesty found out, he was furious. For the past two months, he's been investigating all suspicious places in the city, hoping to find some clues. Our City Lord has really suffered. Sigh, I really don't understand why Miss Wisdom Woman ran away. Isn't marrying into the imperial family good?\"\n\nNianbing's heart stirred. So it was because of Luo Rou. It seemed Gan Ma's actions were really swift! With Luo Rou's intelligence, she naturally wouldn't be caught, which was good. Now that she was in the Olan Empire, she would definitely have better development under that specific political background. He wouldn't have to worry about her anymore; this time, he had truly helped her all the way. When he had the chance to visit the Olan Empire again in the future, he probably would be able to see her there. The Ice Moon Empire losing a talent over a perplexing marriage—he wondered if their king was a fool.\n\nGalamandis's eyes instantly lit up when he heard the words \"Wisdom Woman.\" He said, \"Wisdom Woman? Who's that? That title sounds very strange!\" His voice was loud, immediately causing passersby to look sideways. The passerby Nianbing had stopped earlier quickly ran away.\n\nNianbing pulled Galamandis and quickened their pace, whispering, \"Keep your voice down. The term 'Wisdom Woman' should be taboo in the city right now. I don't want any trouble. Originally, Ice and Snow City had three great beauties: Wisdom Woman Luo Rou, Gentle Woman Long Ling, and the Crazy Woman Xue Jing you like. I actually know this Wisdom Woman; she ran away precisely because she didn't want to submit to a political marriage. Do you understand now? Alright, let's go quickly, aren't you going to Clear Wind Pavilion to eat?\"\n\nGalamandis's spirits lifted. He straightened his clothes, puffed out his chest, and raised his head. His own appearance was stern and resolute; although not as handsome as Nianbing, the aura he exuded easily drew attention. Today, to meet Xue Jing, he had even used energy to conjure a red warrior's suit with gold trim, which highlighted his robust dragon physique, making him appear even more mighty.\n\nNianbing wore a bamboo hat on his head. White hair, in any country, was usually only seen on elderly people. He didn't want to draw attention, so as soon as he landed from the sky, he tied up his hair and put on the bamboo hat to cover it.\n\nArriving at a small path not far from Clear Wind Pavilion, Nianbing stopped. Looking at the bustling crowd, he couldn't help but hesitate. After all, what should he say when he saw Xue Jing? He didn't know. He truly didn't want to face this girl he had once hurt. However, Galamandis's eagerness made him have to face it.\n\nClear Wind Pavilion, a familiar place to Nianbing. Countless events had happened here. Great Achievement Pavilion, opposite Clear Wind Pavilion, had undergone some changes from before. The originally flamboyant and beautiful waitresses at the entrance were gone, replaced by only two male servers attending to guests. Clear Wind Pavilion's business was clearly much better than Great Achievement Pavilion's, with many more customers coming and going. It seemed that the shift in power between the two sides, caused by Nianbing's appearance back then, had not changed since.\n\n\"Let's go! You've been staring here for half a day, Nianbing, I'm hungry. Let's go in and eat.\" Galamandis saw that Nianbing's expression was a bit off, his eyes seeming a little dazed, and didn't rush him too much.\n\nNianbing sighed inwardly. What needed to be faced would always be faced. Since he had already come, he shouldn't run away anymore. Since it was his fault back then, this visit could be considered an apology to Xue Jing. Thinking this, he nodded and, together with Galamandis, left the small path and walked towards Clear Wind Pavilion.\n\nThe comfortable and elegant atmosphere of Clear Wind Pavilion was still the same. As soon as they entered, Nianbing felt a bit more relaxed. The faint fragrance of flowers and plants was refreshing and indescribably comfortable.\n\nGalamandis looked around. Not finding his target, he somewhat dejectedly walked to an empty table and sat down, muttering to himself, \"Why isn't she here? Never mind, let's eat something first. Anyway, eating is also a kind of enjoyment.\" Having arrived here, his heart felt much calmer. Having Nianbing by his side to help him with ideas was much better than the confusion he felt when pursuing Xue Jing alone before.\n\nNianbing walked to Galamandis's side and was about to sit down when a voice suddenly sounded. \"Excuse me, gentlemen, this table has already been reserved. Please choose another table.\"\n\nNianbing froze for a moment, but Galamandis had already stood up. Neither of them wanted trouble, and Galamandis especially didn't want to leave a bad impression on Xue Jing. However, when they looked around, they found that Clear Wind Pavilion's main hall was already full. Only the table in front of them was empty.\n\nNianbing frowned slightly, saying, \"Now this is the only table left, so where should we sit? Are there any private rooms available inside?\"\n\nThe server politely said, \"I'm sorry, we are full right now. I'm afraid you'll have to wait outside for a while. I'll give you a number. I'll invite you gentlemen in once a customer checks out.\"\n\nGalamandis said impatiently, \"No, I'm tired. Anyway, there's no one here, so let's just eat here for now. You run a restaurant, shouldn't you satisfy your customers' needs?\"\n\nThe server gave a wry smile, \"Sir. I am truly sorry, but this table was reserved by a distinguished guest, and he has already paid a large deposit. We truly cannot make the decision ourselves! Please don't make things difficult for us, alright? Thank you.\"\n\nNianbing looked at the table's location and suddenly understood. This table was in the best spot in the entire hall, not only by the window but also offering a view of the elegant decor throughout the hall. Customers dining in Clear Wind Pavilion never made loud noises, and this particular spot was the quietest and best location, with other customers maintaining a certain distance from it. Judging by the server's words, the person who reserved this table was likely either rich or noble.\n\n\"How long has that guest reserved it for? Since there's no other place right now, why not let us sit for a while?\" He didn't recognize this server; he was clearly new.\n\nThe server froze for a moment, as a hint of daze suddenly appeared in his mind when he saw Nianbing's azure eyes. Ever since the Heavenly Eye Acupoint was activated, Nianbing's mental power had reached a new realm. Although he wasn't intentionally releasing it, his gaze was not something ordinary humans could withstand.\n\nWhile the server was momentarily dazed, Nianbing had already sat down beside Galamandis. The server snapped back to attention, instantly feeling anxious. The person who had reserved this spot was someone he couldn't afford to offend, let alone the owner of Clear Wind Pavilion! Just as he was about to continue persuading them, a cool voice suddenly sounded from outside the door, \"Since these two gentlemen want to sit in this spot, then go ahead and sit. Anyway, eating alone is a bit dull for me.\"\n\nNianbing and Galamandis looked up simultaneously, only to see a young man, about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, dressed in a blue robe, walking towards their table. The young man looked somewhat familiar to Nianbing. He was handsome, and although his voice was cool, he had a faint smile on his face. Seeing Nianbing looking at him, he nodded towards Nianbing.\n\nAt first glance, his attire seemed quite simple, with no elaborate decorations other than a blue robe. However, a closer look revealed that this blue robe was extremely exquisite, certainly not something an ordinary tailor could create. The various patterns embroidered with fine silver threads alone would require immense craftsmanship. Moreover, Nianbing sensed a trace of energy fluctuation from the garment, which seemed to be ice energy.\n\nNarrowing his eyes, Nianbing quietly activated his Heavenly Eye Acupoint. Through the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, he clearly saw that every silver thread on the blue robe emitted a faint energy aura. Although the energy appeared faint on the surface, it was actually completely contained within. This garment was definitely a treasure. Its defensive properties alone were equivalent to a fifth-tier magic defense. Nianbing's heart stirred. Who was this person? With a garment of such high value, and considering the noble aura he unintentionally exuded, he was certainly no ordinary person.\n\nThe server hurried to the young man, bowing respectfully, \"Sir, you've arrived. You see...\"\n\nThe young man waved his hand and smiled slightly, \"It's fine, you may go.\" Saying so, he walked to the table and sat down opposite Nianbing.\n\nNianbing smiled slightly and politely said, \"I'm really sorry for taking the seat you reserved.\"\n\nThe young man smiled slightly, \"It's alright. Seeing that both of you have extraordinary bearing, it is my honor to dine at the same table. Please order anything you like, this meal is on me.\" Although his words were polite, Nianbing caught a glint of shrewdness in his eyes. This person struck Nianbing as very clever. Clearly, he had discerned that Nianbing and Galamandis were not ordinary people; otherwise, he wouldn't be so polite. However, since the other party was so courteous and offering to treat them, Nianbing couldn't say much. When in Rome, do as the Romans do.¹\n\nNianbing said, \"May I ask your esteemed name?\"\n\nThe young man said, \"No need to be polite, my name is Yan Yun. You can just call me by my name. And you two?\"\n\nGalamandis looked at Yan Yun with a slightly strange gleam in his eyes. He was about to speak but Nianbing preempted him, \"My name is Nianbing, and this is my elder brother, Longhuo.\"\n\nYan Yun nodded and summoned the server. Without asking Nianbing or Galamandis, he said to the server, \"Serve the best dishes. I am treating my friends.\"\n\nThe server acknowledged and quickly ran off. One must know that Clear Wind Pavilion's prices were a bit higher than Great Achievement Pavilion's. If they served only the best dishes, it wouldn't be difficult for a meal to cost over a hundred gold coins. Seeing Yan Yun's casual spending, Nianbing's doubts deepened a bit.\n\nGalamandis said indifferently, \"Since you're willing to treat, then we won't be polite. However, my appetite is larger than average, so if you're treating, you'll have to make sure I'm full.\"\n\nYan Yun smiled slightly, saying, \"Of course. I wouldn't dare boast about anything else, but I still have enough money to treat someone to a meal. Brother Long, please eat to your heart's content.\"\n\nA mischievous smile appeared in Galamandis's eyes. He said, \"Good, then I won't hold back.\"\n\nThe dishes arrived very quickly. Even before the guests who arrived earlier had been served, their table was already filled. None of the surrounding guests raised any objections. Galamandis certainly didn't hold back and immediately started eating with his extremely uncouth manners. Nianbing ate slowly, chatting idly with Yan Yun as he ate. Through their casual conversation, he found that Yan Yun's knowledge in various fields was extremely vast, and his casual remarks always carried a deeper meaning.\n___\n¹*When in Rome, do as the Romans do.* (Literal translation: Since you have come, then settle down.)",

    "content": "Yan Yun initially felt nothing, but as the third table of food entered Galamandis's stomach, a hint of surprise appeared in his eyes. One must know, these three tables of dishes were three hundred gold coins! Seeing that Galamandis's speed hadn't slowed in the slightest, he couldn't help but feel a little perplexed. Of course, it wasn't because of the money, but because of Galamandis's appetite. One must know, a single lavish table of dishes was enough for ten people to eat, yet with three tables of dishes gone, Galamandis showed no change at all, not even a slight protrusion in his stomach.\n\nNing Bing didn't eat fast, and the amount he ate was similar to Yan Yun. Through their conversation, Yan Yun found that Ning Bing spoke very subtly. He would say a few more words about ordinary matters, but once their conversation touched upon his and Galamandis's identities, he would naturally gloss over it, never saying an extra word.\n\n\"Good, truly delicious! Come, Brother Yan Yun, let the waiter bring another table.\"\n\nYan Yun smiled slightly, nodded, and ordered the waiter to bring another table of the same dishes. He said, \"Brother Dragon Fire's appetite truly makes this younger brother envious. If I could eat this much too, perhaps I could grow a bit sturdier.\"\n\nGalamandis, while clearing away the remaining dishes on the table, mumbled somewhat indistinctly, \"You cultivate ice-attribute Battle Qi. No matter how much you eat, your physique won't change, unless you reach the Martial Saint level or above, only then can you freely alter your body's form. But, that will take at least another ten years.\"\n\nYan Yun's heart jolted. He was precisely at the Martial Warrior level. Galamandis didn't even seem to have looked at him directly, yet he had stated his current state in one breath. How could this not surprise him? His heart immediately became a little more wary. He smiled faintly and said, \"Indeed! Another ten years. Cultivation requires gradual progress. Even if I rush, it's no use.\"\n\n\"Not enough ingredients, can't make a whole table, Mr. Yan. Please choose some other dishes.\" A plain voice sounded, devoid of a waiter's usual politeness. Ning Bing and the two others looked in the direction of the voice. Galamandis immediately trembled all over, even forgetting to eat, because the one speaking was Xue Jing, whom he had longed for day and night.\n\nXue Jing was still as before, only a bit thinner than when Ning Bing last saw her. A red long dress accentuated her full and graceful figure, making her as dazzling as a blooming rose. Of course, roses have thorns. However, one had to admit that when Xue Jing wasn't in a bad temper, her looks were in no way inferior to Dragon Spirit or Luo Rou's.\n\nYan Yun's eyes lit up, and he quickly stood up, saying, \"Miss Xue, hello. My apologies for today. My friend here ate a bit too much. If there are no more ingredients, then please just bring some other delicious dishes.\"\n\nXue Jing glanced at Galamandis somewhat oddly. Because Ning Bing was wearing a bamboo hat, she hadn't seen Ning Bing's face. \"Is he your friend?\" She pointed at Galamandis.\n\nYan Yun nodded, somewhat surprised, and said, \"Does Miss Xue know Brother Dragon Fire? That's wonderful, we've only just met too.\"\n\nA hint of coldness appeared on Xue Jing's face. She strode over to Galamandis's side. \"Who told you to come? I chased you away last time, why are you back like a fly again? Our Qingfeng Zhai doesn't welcome guests like you, get out.\"\n\nGalamandis froze for a moment, a faint bitterness appearing on his face. He sighed lightly and said, \"Miss Xue. Your Qingfeng Zhai is open for business, how can you just drive away customers? I know you don't have much affection for me. But I didn't come to pester you this time, did I? No matter what, shouldn't you at least let me finish this meal before I leave?\" His meaning was very clear: since I didn't provoke you, why are you driving me out? Your family runs a restaurant! This move was taught to him by Ning Bing beforehand, and then utilized by Galamandis after his own comprehension. Galamandis played this sympathy card specifically to gain a shred of pity.\n\nSure enough, his tactic worked. Xue Jing was startled at first, then frowned and said, \"Then hurry up and leave when you're done eating. Don't bother me, understood?\"\n\nGalamandis picked up a piece of dish with his chopsticks and put it into his mouth. \"I just came to eat, I simply like the dishes here. Is there something wrong with that too? Miss Xue is being a bit too overbearing, aren't you?\" Ning Bing had told him that girls like Xue Jing hated sycophants who flattered others the most. The more compliant he was with her, the more she would look down on him.\n\nXue Jing evidently hadn't encountered such an attitude from Galamandis. \"Alright, you're doing well! Haven't seen you in a few days and you've grown quite a temper.\"\n\nGalamandis smiled slightly and said, \"Even if my temper grew a bit more, I probably still wouldn't compare to yours, Miss.\"\n\n\"You...\" Xue Jing had a straightforward temper and simply didn't understand patience. A flash of light appeared in her eyes, and she raised her hand and swung it towards Galamandis. Her hand even carried a faint red Battle Qi, clearly not just playing around.\n\n\"Miss Xue, please show mercy.\" Blue Battle Qi emerged from Yan Yun's hand, carrying an icy aura. He grabbed Xue Jing's hand. \"Why bother getting angry, Miss Xue? My friend here merely came to eat. If you two have some grievances, would you please give me some face, Miss?\"\n\nGalamandis saw Yan Yun holding Xue Jing's hand, and fire nearly shot out of his eyes. The slight good impression he had just formed of Yan Yun instantly vanished. He let out a snort, stood up, and said, \"Since this place doesn't wish to keep us, we'll just leave.\" As he spoke, he walked directly towards Xue Jing, not yielding in the slightest, straight into Xue Jing's body.\n\nXue Jing, whose hand was held by Yan Yun, surprisingly didn't struggle. Seeing Galamandis approach, her other hand immediately shot out with Battle Qi, striking towards him, and the angry gleam in her eyes rose again.\n\nGalamandis allowed Xue Jing's palm to strike him, emitting a 'bang'. He didn't even budge. Instead, Xue Jing took a step back. Under the pull of the energy, Xue Jing's entire body trembled, and the hand that Yan Yun had been holding immediately broke free.\n\nYan Yun's heart jolted. He still had some understanding of Xue Jing's strength. Although that palm strike just now wasn't full force, it wasn't light either. He asked himself, even with the treasure armor on his body, he wouldn't dare to use his body to block Xue Jing's palm. Yet Galamandis not only blocked it but even sent Xue Jing a step back. Such strength was likely already above his own.\n\nXue Jing glared furiously at Galamandis. \"Alright! You dare to hit me now. I'll beat you to death.\" A scorching aura rose around her body, and the Battle Qi in her hands immediately intensified.\n\nJust then, a somewhat helpless voice sounded, \"Stop fighting, Xue Jing, your temper still hasn't changed!\"\n\nXue Jing froze for a moment and looked in the direction of the voice. She saw the person wearing the bamboo hat stand up and lift the hat a bit higher. Her delicate body trembled violently, and Xue Jing instantly froze. The Battle Qi she had gathered naturally dispersed. Unsure if it was due to excitement or anger, her voice trembled slightly. \"You, you're back.\"\n\nNing Bing sighed lightly and said, \"Yes! I'm back. Brother Dragon Fire is my friend, so please show him mercy.\"\n\nXue Jing had by this point recovered from the shock of their first meeting. Her eyes reddened. \"You still know how to come back. You, you...\"\n\nGalamandis glanced at Ning Bing somewhat oddly. Ning Bing, however, was looking at Xue Jing and smiled bitterly, \"Xue Jing, no matter what, we're still friends, aren't we? Can't I come back to see you and Uncle Xue?\"\n\nXue Jing's expression turned cold. She suddenly turned to Galamandis and asked, \"You like me a lot, don't you?\"\n\nGalamandis froze, then instinctively nodded, saying, \"Yes! If I didn't like you, why would I pester you?\"\n\nXue Jing nodded and said, \"Alright then, if you kill this person, I'll agree to be with you.\" As she spoke, her hand pointed accurately at Ning Bing's chest. Although rage had seized her heart, her mind was still very clear. She knew Galamandis possessed considerable strength, which was why she said such a thing.\n\nGalamandis froze. He said, \"Do you hate him that much? Others, maybe, but Ning Bing is my brother, I can't lay a hand on him. Although I like you very much, I would absolutely not kill my own brother for a woman. Ning Bing, I think we should go.\" He was somewhat disappointed in Xue Jing. He sighed lightly and turned to walk out.\n\nNing Bing glanced at Xue Jing and followed Galamandis out. Xue Jing shrieked, \"Don't you dare leave, none of you! Yan Yun, if he won't do it, then you kill this person for me. If you kill him, I'll promise to marry you. Haven't you been trying to win me over ever since you lost Luo Rou? If you kill this person, I'll agree to anything.\"\n\nYan Yun froze. He was no pampered playboy. Xue Jing's words had already exposed his identity. If it were about killing for a woman, he would absolutely do it, but never in such a public setting. He had to preserve his reputation. Although Xue Jing's beauty attracted him, the position of women in his heart would never surpass that of power. \"I'm sorry, Miss Xue. Although this Brother Ning Bing and I have only just met, I cannot simply attack him! What kind of hatred is between you two that you must kill him?\"\n\nNing Bing looked at Yan Yun, his heart suddenly enlightened. So the person before him was actually the Fifth Prince, most likely to inherit the throne of the Ice Moon Empire. No wonder, no wonder he could gain the Ice Moon Empire King's appreciation. He truly had some capability.\n\nXue Jing said hatefully, \"He insulted my character. I've never hated anyone as much as I hate him. Are you going to kill him or not? Fine, you both won't act, right? Then I'll do it myself.\" Saying this, she floated up and swung her hand to strike Ning Bing.\n\nThis time, Yan Yun did not stop Xue Jing again. Galamandis also stood by silently, allowing Xue Jing's hand, brimming with Battle Qi, to strike towards Ning Bing.\n\nNing Bing stood there, his gaze calmly fixed on Xue Jing. *Bang, bang*, two loud thuds. The scorching aura brought forth by the fire Battle Qi scattered. Ning Bing took two steps back but did not fall. Xue Jing's mood at this moment was extremely complex. Ning Bing had originally opened her heart, yet then rejected her. Even she herself was unsure whether her love for Ning Bing was greater, or her hatred. Tears had already blurred her vision. She mechanically and frantically struck palm after palm at Ning Bing. Throughout the Qingfeng Zhai hall, Battle Qi soared, frightening the original diners who fled in a panic.\n\nNing Bing did not dodge even once, nor did he launch an attack at Xue Jing. He allowed Xue Jing's palm strikes, one after another, imbued with Battle Qi strong enough to cleave gold and crack stone, to assault his body. The fire Battle Qi's aura surged wildly from his chest, invading his meridians. However, the current Ning Bing was different from before. Possessing a dragon physique, let alone Xue Jing, even if a Martial Saint were here, it wouldn't be easy to hurt his yin-yang strangeness* with solely Battle Qi.\n\n*Thudding* sounds were incessant. Finally, the breathless Xue Jing stopped, panting heavily. Unleashing Battle Qi at full power was very draining for her, and she had to stop to rest first.\n\nNing Bing opened his mouth and exhaled a puff of hot air. The magical power within his body, combined with his dragon physique, had already completely dissolved Xue Jing's Battle Qi. \"One hundred and sixteen palm strikes in total, Xue Jing. Your anger should have subsided by now, right? It was my fault back then, I apologize to you.\" Saying this, he bowed deeply to Xue Jing.\n\nXue Jing choked out, \"An apology? Can an insult like yours to me be resolved with just an apology? Ning Bing, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!\" Tears scattered in the air. She turned and ran towards the back, unaware that she had even knocked over a table.\n\nYan Yun looked at Ning Bing and Galamandis somewhat helplessly. \"I'm really sorry, Miss Xue's temper is indeed a bit much. Gentlemen, I have something to attend to, so I'll be leaving first. If there's an opportunity in the future, I will certainly treat you both to a good meal again.\" Both Ning Bing and Galamandis had left a deep impression on him. Their strong defensive capabilities caused a degree of wariness to rise in Yan Yun's heart. The Ice Moon Empire King's health was poor and he was very weak now. Although he favored Yan Yun the most, Yan Yun still had four older brothers. At this time, it was the most intense period for the struggle for the throne, hence Yan Yun's heavy sense of caution.\n\nAs Yan Yun turned and left, Galamandis smiled bitterly, \"Unfair, truly unfair!\"\n\nNing Bing looked at him confusedly and said, \"What's unfair? Do you wish those hundred-odd palm strikes had landed on you? Although Kaka gave me very strong physical defense, taking so many hits in the same spot, it's a bit numb now.\"\n\nGalamandis smiled bitterly, \"I'm not talking about that. I'm referring to Xue Jing's conditions. She told me to kill you, and only said she'd be with me. But she told that pretty boy to kill you and promised to give herself to him. That's f***ing unfair!\"\n\nNing Bing's heart broke into a cold sweat. He rolled his eyes and said, \"So, if she promised herself to you, you would have killed me?\"\n\nGalamandis chuckled, \"How about I go ask her? If she agrees, you can just pretend to be dead, and then wouldn't your big brother have someone?\"\n\n---\n*Footnote for 阴阳怪气 (yīnyángguàiqì): This idiom typically means \"sarcastic,\" \"sneering,\" or \"peculiar/eccentric.\" Its usage here in the context of physical injury is highly unusual and suggests it may be a common typographical error in the original text, where the intended word was likely \"easily\" (轻易).

    "content": "念冰 grumpily snorted and said, \"What's the point? What use is it if you get her body but not her heart? You'll need to work much harder to win Xue over. Ai, looking at her, why does she seem even more hysterical than before? Could it be that the trauma I brought her is really that severe? The method I used back then was too extreme; I truly owe her.\"\n\nGalamandis patted Nian Bing's shoulder and said, \"Alright, let's go. Lest she runs out again to continue hitting us. I never thought that we, brothers, would turn into punching bags right after arriving in Ice and Snow City. To think that my great Galamandis would have such a day.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Wasn't that your heartfelt wish? If you yourself are willing to be a punching bag, who can stop you?\" As the two spoke, they headed outwards. Just then, a deep and resonant voice rang out, \"Nian Bing.\"\n\nNian Bing turned around to look, only to see Xue Ji, clad in green, walk out from the inner room. The moment he saw Nian Bing, his face immediately lit up with joy. His figure glided, and he was already beside Nian Bing and Galamandis. \"Nian Bing, you've returned, this is truly wonderful. Just now, I heard my subordinates say that Xue Jing was fighting with you outside, I'm truly sorry about that!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"Hello, Uncle Xue. Actually, it's nothing; consider it my compensation to her.\"\n\nXue Ji sighed lightly and said, \"Ah, this daughter of mine! She's just too stubborn. I know all about your situation, and it's not your fault. After all, how can matters of the heart be forced? Come, quickly come inside my place and rest for a while; you've finally returned. This time, you must stay in Clear Wind Pavilion for a few more days.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Alright then. I'll impose on you.\" He didn't really want to stay there, but thinking about being able to create some opportunities for Galamandis, he agreed. For Xue Jing, he had always felt guilty. Galamandis could be said to be the person he trusted most, and he happened to like Xue Jing. Nian Bing sincerely wanted to bring them together. One reason was to fulfill Galamandis's infatuation, and the other was to give Xue Jing an explanation. Galamandis had said that if Xue Jing was willing to be with him, she would not only be free from the limitations of human lifespan but also greatly improve her strength with his help. No matter how one looked at it, this was a good thing. Moreover, Galamandis was definitely a Dragon worth entrusting one's life to.\n\nUnder Xue Ji's guidance, Nian Bing and Galamandis followed him to the inner hall of Clear Wind Pavilion. Xue Ji ordered his subordinates to brew tea. After asking Nian Bing and Galamandis to sit down, he said, \"Nian Bing, you're quite the sensation now!\"\n\nNian Bing was startled and said, \"What sensation? How would I know?\" Xue Ji said with some surprise, \"How could you not know? You've brought great renown to our Ice Moon Empire! These days, that old fellow Long Zhi has been grinning from ear to ear every single day!\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred, and only then did he understand that Xue Ji was referring to his victory in the New Elite Magicians' Grand Competition. He smiled faintly, \"The news spread so quickly. So, you all already know. Is my master doing well?\"\n\n\"Well, of course, he's doing splendidly, simply beyond good. Originally, Luo Rou's family leaving had greatly enraged His Majesty the King. Not only did our Ice and Snow City suffer, but even the entire Ice Moon Empire was implicated, and the entire country was investigating their whereabouts. Just then, the triumphant news of you winning the championship of the New Elite Magicians' Grand Competition returned. This time, our Ice Moon Empire gained immense prestige on the continent; both the first and second places were ours! In history, no country has ever achieved such good results. His Majesty the King was overjoyed, and the turmoil brought by Luo Rou finally subsided a great deal. Your master also gained His Majesty the King's appreciation because of you, and the allocations for your Magician's Guild were reinstated. Now, he's at the height of his glory! Under his leadership, the Magician's Guild has gained dozens of new magicians in just one month. Moreover, your Guild's reputation has greatly increased compared to before. Although it cannot compare to the Ice God Tower in the short term, it is certainly no longer disregarded as it once was. Every time your master mentions you, his face lights up with joy, and he always says he had chosen the right person.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"It's my duty to contribute to the Guild. Actually, my victory was also a bit clever; in terms of strength, I was still a bit inferior to Qianhuan Bingyun at that time. What about you, sir? Have you been well during this period? Just now, I saw Xue Jing, and her emotional state seemed quite unstable. Ai, it's all my fault.\"\n\nXue Ji sighed lightly and said, \"Good or bad, it depends on two perspectives. From the Clear Wind Pavilion's perspective, your help back then allowed our Clear Wind Pavilion to surpass Grand Achievement Pavilion again. Later, you introduced Little Junior Sister Ming to us, which greatly increased the strength of our kitchen, and Grand Achievement Pavilion is no longer a concern. However, from Jing'er's perspective, it's not so good. Ever since she secretly ran out to bring you back, she has spent most of her time practicing in the garden and rarely goes out. This girl takes things to heart so much! Even I can't manage her anymore. Nian Bing, rest assured, I don't blame you for this matter. Perhaps, after a few more days, her heart will calm down. However, this girl's temper is really too bad; whether she can get married later is even a question.\" With a long sigh, Xue Ji's face was filled with helplessness.\n\n\"Of course she can! I am very willing to be with Miss Xue Jing.\" Facing Xue Ji, who might become his father-in-law, Galamandis eagerly stated his position.\n\nXue Ji glanced at Galamandis and said, \"I didn't expect you to know Nian Bing. I'm truly sorry, but Jing'er doesn't have any feelings for you. It's best if you don't bother her anymore.\" Evidently, he had seen Galamandis more than once and had a poor impression of him.\n\nNian Bing couldn't bear to see Galamandis embarrassed, so he smiled slightly and said, \"Uncle Xue, I haven't had a chance to introduce you yet. This is my elder brother, Longhuo. His strength is far beyond mine. Big Brother, I presume you know Uncle Xue here.\"\n\nGalamandis hastily nodded and said, \"Know him, of course I know him. I've met Uncle a few times when I came to see Miss Xue Jing before.\" He shamelessly called him Uncle. If Xue Ji knew his actual age was unknown multiples of his own, who knew what he would think.\n\nNian Bing secretly chuckled, but on the surface, he tried his best to maintain composure. He said, \"Uncle Xue, my elder brother is actually a very good person.\"\n\nXue Ji frowned and said, \"He's your elder brother? Nian Bing! You don't know, but your elder brother used to pester Jing'er day and night, even coming to Clear Wind Pavilion. Jing'er's mood hasn't recovered recently, and it's probably somewhat related to him.\"\n\nGalamandis lowered his head and said, \"Actually, I didn't pester her every day; it was only for a few months, I think. Uncle Xue, I truly like Xue Jing; I miss her terribly if I don't see her for a day.\" No wonder Xue Ji had a poor impression of him. Back then, Xue Ji had tried many methods to stop him from pestering his daughter, using tricks like magic seals and sending people to guard her. But how could these tricks stop Galamandis? Xue Jing inevitably saw Galamandis's infatuated face every day, and in her heart, Galamandis was absolutely synonymous with a fly.\n\nNian Bing knew it wouldn't be easy to change Xue Ji and Xue Jing's attitudes towards Galamandis, so he coughed. Changing the subject, he asked, \"Uncle Xue, just now when we were eating, we met someone named Yan Yun. Is he the Fifth Prince of the Ice Moon Empire?\"\n\nA trace of surprise appeared in Xue Ji's eyes, as if wondering why Nian Bing would know. \"Indeed, he is the Fifth Prince. Ai, that girl Luo Rou's entire family suddenly left, causing a huge uproar. Her fiancée running away a year before the wedding was a great humiliation for the Fifth Prince. To investigate this matter, he personally came to Ice and Snow City. Because he liked the simple elegance of my place, he has always been eating here. I originally wanted to arrange a private room for him, but he insisted on staying in the main hall. The Fifth Prince is a very good person. He has no princely airs at all and is approachable. He is excellent in all aspects. Among all the princes, he is the one I favor most.\"\n\nGalamandis muttered from the side, \"Isn't it because you want him to be your son-in-law?\" Although his voice was very low, how could Xue Ji not hear it? If it were just Galamandis there, he would have reacted long ago, but in Nian Bing's presence, he pretended not to hear anything.\n\nNian Bing secretly thought, *Even if that Fifth Prince is excellent, he can't possibly compare to a Dragon Scion of the Dragon Clan, can he? I truly don't know what this elder brother Galamandis did to make Xue Ji and his daughter have such a bad impression of him.*\n\n\"Uncle Xue, I want to go back to the Guild for a look later. After being away for so long, I should go back and check in. Also, could I trouble you to arrange a place for my elder brother Longhuo to stay here in Clear Wind Pavilion? Staying here is more comfortable than the Guild, and at least meals are much more convenient.\"\n\nXue Ji chuckled, \"What's the problem with that? Are you still worried about food? You yourself are the most outstanding chef! Oh, right. I heard that when you were in the Hua Rong Empire, you participated in the Huayue Culinary Challenge, but you didn't join the final match, which is why you didn't get the qualification to participate in the Chef God Competition, right?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"The culinary world truly produces many talents. Even if I had participated in the final match, I wouldn't have been sure of winning the championship. I met someone who could use the Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand*. His culinary skills are absolutely no less than mine. I use magic in my cooking, while he uses battle qi in his; his abilities are very strong.\"\n\nXue Ji smiled faintly, \"I've already heard about it. However, you'll still have a chance to compete against him. I'd like you to represent our Clear Wind Pavilion in the next Chef God Competition. I wonder if you're interested.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes lit up. He said, \"Of course I am! Back then, my master consecutively won the championship in five Chef God Competitions. Although I can't compare to my master, I very much hope to participate in this continent's most top-tier culinary competition. Recently, I've had some new research in the field of culinary arts. I think I shouldn't bring shame to Clear Wind Pavilion. Can I?\"\n\n\"Of course you can! This is an honor for our Clear Wind Pavilion! With you participating, we are sure to achieve a good result this time. The Chef God Competition has extremely strict entry requirements. The current president of the Competition Organizing Committee is Chef God Lie, one of the original Five Chef Gods. The Committee is composed of dozens of famous culinary masters and gourmets. After the previous culinary competition ends, they will evaluate restaurants in various countries across the continent, select qualified restaurants, and grant these restaurants a fixed quota. Finally, a few random quotas will be left for outstanding chefs who are not affiliated with restaurants to participate, just like the top three in the Huayue Culinary Challenge. Our Clear Wind Pavilion was fortunate enough to suppress Grand Achievement Pavilion and secure a spot this time. Speaking of which, it's all thanks to you!\"\n\nNian Bing was startled. He said, \"Are you saying even a restaurant like Grand Achievement Pavilion doesn't have a spot?\"\n\nXue Ji nodded. He said, \"Of course. Do you think just anyone can participate in the Chef God Competition? The current Chef God Competition is different from the one in your teacher's time; it's organized much more meticulously, and all procedures are very reasonable and rigorous. It's extremely difficult to obtain an entry spot. Only cities the size of our Ice and Snow City might produce one representative. Our Ice Moon Empire only has two spots in total! I heard that the Orlan Empire only has one spot for the entire country. Besides our Clear Wind Pavilion, the Crescent Moon Restaurant in the capital of Ice Moon City has also gained this honor. The competition will be held in the capital of Langmu Empire in three months. At that time, I will select a few experts from our Clear Wind Pavilion to accompany you.\"\n\nNian Bing had a deep understanding of the Chef God Competition. Cha Ji had once explained the rules of the Chef God Competition to him in detail. Back then, when Cha Ji was teaching him culinary arts, he had said that as a top-tier chef, if one had never won the Chef God Competition championship, one could never ascend to the throne of the Chef King. The Chef God Competition would gather all the top chefs on the continent. It was the best place for tempering oneself. Through sparring with other renowned chefs, it played a very important role in improving culinary skills. Magic was something Nian Bing had to master for revenge and self-protection. Culinary arts, however, could be said to be his hobby. From the day he left Peach Blossom Forest, he had vowed that he would inherit Cha Ji's dying wish and become the top chef on the Yangguang Continent. The Chef God Competition was finally about to begin. Nian Bing's heart was filled with anticipation.\n\nAs Xue Ji said, the rules of the Chef God Competition were extremely rigorous, but at the same time, also extremely fair. The person who achieved the final championship must demonstrate powerful abilities in all aspects of culinary arts. The Chef God Competition was divided into five rounds: cold dishes, hot dishes, soups, pastries, and special culinary arts. Every participating chef must go through these five rounds of competition, and after passing various evaluations, they would then enter the final round.\n\n---\n* **Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand**: A specific culinary technique mentioned in the story.",

    "title": "Chapter 133 The number of the chef god competition (Part 1)",
    "content": "One of the greatest features of the God of Cookery Competition is that all chefs compete in the same arena. However, only ten people can enter the final round. Among these ten, five are the champions from each of the five preliminary matches, while the other five spots are chosen from the people with the highest overall scores in the five matches, excluding the five champions. The final ten then determine their rankings through the decisive match. During the final, the ten finalists must also prepare cold dishes, hot dishes, soups, pastries, and demonstrate special culinary skills. After comprehensive evaluation, their rankings are determined by scores. There is one strict condition: if the person who ultimately wins the overall championship does not win any of the five individual competition categories, then, although he is the victor, he cannot be granted the title of God of Cookery. After all, without a skill that surpasses all others, how can one be called a God of Cookery? Of course, the number of finalists is not necessarily ten. If the same person wins two individual match championships, the number of finalists will naturally decrease by one, and so on. However, since the God of Cookery Competition began, no one has ever been able to win all five individual match championships simultaneously; if that were the case, there would be no need for a final. The first rule of the God of Cookery Competition is: if a culinary genius emerges who can win all five individual match championships simultaneously, then the final will be canceled, and he will be bestowed the title of Saint God of Cookery. Back in Ghost Chef Cha Ji's peak period, he only managed to win three individual match championships. He had always strived for the title of Saint God of Cookery, but after winning five consecutive overall championships, he realized that no matter how hard he tried, it was impossible to reach the pinnacle in every aspect of culinary art. He had no choice but to give up and become a judge instead.\n\nNian Bing inherited Cha Ji's wish. Besides that, obtaining the title of Saint God of Cookery was his greatest pursuit. Of course, he had even less confidence in achieving something that Cha Ji couldn't. Although his culinary skills had improved significantly by researching the Seven-Element Feast during this period, he had no confidence at all in being able to win all five individual match championships. Just Xiao Tian, who could use the Yin-Yang Harmonizing Tai Chi Hand, was the biggest obstacle on his path forward.\n\nThe biggest difference between the God of Cookery Competition and the Hua Long Challenge was that, although the main chef participated in the God of Cookery Competition, the main chef could bring two to three assistants to help. Assistants could help the main chef with cooking. This was because the time for each match was very short, and in categories where the main chef was not skilled, assistants could play a crucial role. Of course, assistants also had restrictions. They could only provide auxiliary support; the actual cooking had to be completed by the main chef.\n\nRecalling everything about the God of Cookery Competition, Nian Bing's heart couldn't help but warm up. Clear Wind Pavilion still had the sibling duo Ming Yuan and Ming Hui. If they teamed up to be his assistants, the chances of winning the overall championship would be very high.\n\n\"Uncle Xue, if I represent Clear Wind Pavilion in the competition, then my goal will be only one.\"\n\nXue Ji picked up the tea that a servant had just brought and took a sip. He smiled slightly and said, \"I think you have that kind of strength. I believe that's beyond doubt. I think Long Zhi misses you very much, so why don't you go over there and see him first? I'll arrange your accommodations.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said to Galamandis, \"Big Brother, then you stay here for now. I'll make a trip to the Mage Guild first.\"\n\nGalamandis glanced at Xue Ji, nodded, but said nothing.\n\nXue Ji said, \"Nian Bing, tell Long Zhi to come to my Clear Wind Pavilion tonight. I'll throw a welcoming celebration for you.\"\n\nGalamandis couldn't help but ask, \"Will Miss Xue Jing be there?\"\n\nXue Ji frowned and said, \"Of course she will. How could the inheritor of my Clear Wind Pavilion not attend? You're Long Huo, right? I'm sternly warning you, don't pester my daughter again. For Nian Bing's sake, I can let you stay, but if you sneak into my daughter's boudoir again like before, don't blame me for being impolite.\"\n\nNian Bing widened his eyes, looking at the somewhat embarrassed Galamandis. Sneaking into someone's boudoir, is that even allowed? No wonder Xue Ji's attitude towards him was so bad. \"Uncle Xue, I guarantee on behalf of Big Brother that he will never do such a thing again, right, Big Brother Long?\" Nian Bing deliberately emphasized the last three words.\n\nGalamandis quickly nodded and said, \"Yes, I definitely won't again. I was in the wrong before.\" To pursue Xue Jing, he, who was always so proud, actually admitted his mistake. It was truly difficult for him.\n\nXue Jing sat blankly on her bed. By now, her mood had gradually calmed. After the anger in her heart disappeared, it was replaced by a sense of loss. The faces of Nian Bing, Galamandis, and Yan Yun constantly replayed in her mind. The three men brought her completely different feelings. She had once asked herself, did she really like Nian Bing? That man could be said to completely disregard her. Back in Ice Orchid City, he was clearly finding an excuse to send her away, but why couldn't she forget him? What was so good about him? What did she like about him? His handsome appearance, powerful magic, or exquisite culinary skills? Perhaps all of them. But she hadn't spent much time with him. When she saw him just now, why was she angry? Was it love turned to hate, or a psychological reaction to being rejected? Xue Jing's heart was a mess; she herself couldn't figure out what she truly felt for Nian Bing.\n\nAfter Nian Bing, two other men appeared in her life. One was the relentlessly pestering Galamandis, and the other was the handsome, dashing, and noble Fifth Prince Yan Yun. For Yan Yun, Xue Jing felt somewhat favorably, not because of his status, but more because of his outstanding appearance and capable demeanor. As for Galamandis, she felt more anger. In those days, he would appear punctually like a fly every day, which was incredibly annoying. However, two months ago, he suddenly left, a sudden departure without any warning. For some reason, she felt a bit lost. In the days she didn't see him, that hateful red figure often appeared in her mind. If Nian Bing hadn't appeared today, would she have been somewhat happy? But that hateful fellow's attitude towards her seemed to have changed a bit too. He no longer bowed and scraped like before. Who exactly was he? His martial arts seemed very strong; even her father couldn't gauge his strength. He had only truly attacked once, that time against the head of the Warrior Guild. But that was too exaggerated, wasn't it? Defeating a Martial Saint with one punch? How was that possible?\n\nThe simultaneous appearance of the three men made Xue Jing's heart even more chaotic. She shook her head hard, sighing inwardly. She didn't know how to choose, or even which of these three men was more important in her heart. But she was certain that the most detestable was Nian Bing. He actually rejected her feelings and used such a method to make her angry and leave. No matter what, she could no longer like him. What was so great about him? He just knew a little magic, didn't he? Whenever she thought of Nian Bing, Xue Jing couldn't help but clench her teeth in anger.\n\n\"Jing'er, are you resting?\" Xue Ji's deep voice came from outside.\n\nXue Jing jumped, quickly composed herself, and said, \"Dad. I'm not resting yet? Please come in.\"\n\nXue Ji pushed the door open. Seeing his somewhat haggard daughter, he said with a pained heart, \"Jingjing, are you still unhappy? Alas, Nian Bing is indeed very good, but since he doesn't have you in his heart, why force it?\"\n\nXue Jing snorted and said, \"I wouldn't be sad about him; that guy doesn't deserve it at all. Dad. Are you really planning to let Nian Bing represent our Clear Wind Pavilion in the competition? Nian Bing can't possibly stay with us indefinitely! At most, we can only borrow his strength to gain renown.\"\n\nXue Ji sighed lightly and said, \"If I had a choice, I certainly wouldn't let him represent us in the competition. Nian Bing is like an eagle soaring in the sky; no one can control him. You should have noticed it too; when he returned this time, he was clearly different from before. Not only is his demeanor more composed, but his strength has also greatly improved.\"\n\nXue Jing nodded in agreement. Her hundred-plus palm strikes could completely shatter a large rock, yet Nian Bing, as a mage, had somehow withstood them without any significant injury. This was truly too strange.\n\nXue Ji said, \"I talked to your Uncle Ming. I asked him if he had the confidence to win a ranking if he represented Clear Wind Pavilion in the competition. Guess what your Uncle Ming said? Your Uncle Ming said he doesn't even have the qualifications to participate in the God of Cookery Competition. Even Ming Hui, who has already surpassed his teacher*, could only barely make the cut. Only someone with Nian Bing's culinary skills would have a chance at a good ranking in the competition.\"\n\nXue Jing said in surprise, \"Is Uncle Ming being too unduly modest? With his culinary skills, he should at least get some ranking, right? At the very least, Uncle Ming's skill in pastries is rarely surpassed. Why would he say that?\"\n\nXue Ji sighed lightly and said, \"I've carefully considered this matter as well. In fact, your Uncle Ming's words are very correct; no one knows his own strength better than he does. Our Pavilion is indeed quite good in Ice Snow City. With the sibling duo Ming Yuan and Ming Hui holding the fort, we can establish this enterprise. But looking at the entire continent, talented individuals emerge in droves in the culinary world; that's far beyond what we can imagine. Let alone you, even I am somewhat like a frog in a well**. You've also seen Nian Bing's culinary skills. How do you think he compares to Ming Yuan?\"\n\nAlthough Xue Jing hated Nian Bing, she wouldn't belittle his culinary skills. After all, the memory of that moment was simply too clear. \"Nian Bing's culinary skills are indeed impressive, especially his incorporation of magic into cooking.\"\n\nXue Ji said, \"Once a person's culinary skills reach a certain level, it becomes extremely difficult to improve further. Just like your Uncle Ming, no matter how much he practices, he can never reach Nian Bing's level. Nian Bing's incorporation of magic into cooking is indeed miraculous, but his fundamentals are also solid. Not to mention anything else, his miraculous Ghost Carving Divine Blade—let alone a chef who doesn't know martial arts, even I definitely can't use it. For an ordinary person to train their hands to be so fast and so precise, what immense effort it must take! Since I've made up my decision this time, I won't change it. I must have Nian Bing represent our Clear Wind Pavilion in the God of Cookery Competition. You must always remember not to let your personal grudges affect your focus on the bigger picture. Nian Bing is inherently good-natured. Becoming friends with him will be of great benefit to the future development of our Clear Wind Pavilion. , these four words are not for nothing. Jing'er, although your intelligence isn't as good as Rou'er's, it's pretty close. However, your flaw lies in your overly hot temper. If you could be calmer sometimes, perhaps many things would change. Although Nian Bing appears gentle, I can easily sense the arrogance in his bones. He's like a piece of steel. If you are also a piece of steel, a head-on collision will certainly not have a good outcome. Even if you can't develop a romantic relationship, can't you be friends? Having a friend like him would definitely be a good thing for you. I've already agreed to let him and that boy named Long Huo temporarily stay with us. You must maintain appropriate boundaries.\"\n\nHearing Xue Ji say that Nian Bing and Long Huo were going to stay in Clear Wind Pavilion, Xue Jing's heart suddenly skipped a beat. \"Dad, how can you let that guy Long Huo stay here? Haven't we been annoyed enough by him?\"\n\nXue Ji gave a bitter laugh and said, \"This time it's different. He's here as Nian Bing's friend. For Nian Bing's sake, how can I possibly kick him out? Long Huo has already promised he won't bother you. Since you dislike him, just ignore him. He's Nian Bing's brother, so he shouldn't cause Nian Bing trouble. Alas, that boy Long Huo is handsome and dignified and has a very masculine aura, but he's just too despicable. To actually secretly sneak into your boudoir, for such a person, no matter how strong he is, I firmly oppose you associating with him.\"\n\nXue Jing snorted and said, \"I wish I could kill him; why would I associate with him? However, I can see that his relationship with Nian Bing seems to be very deep.\"\n\nXue Ji said, \"Since they are guests, we can't neglect them too much. Alright, you go rest for a bit. Remember what I just said: don't make things difficult for Nian Bing anymore.\"\n\nXue Jing gently nodded and said, \"Perhaps my anger has been released after hitting him a while ago. I don't hate him as much anymore. Even for Clear Wind Pavilion's sake, I will control my temper.\"\n\nNian Bing walked leisurely on the street. Everything that happened in Clear Wind Pavilion couldn't affect his mood. After facing Xue Jing again and taking those hundred-plus palm strikes, he actually felt a lot lighter, and his initial guilt decreased accordingly. What made him even happier was gaining the qualification to participate in the God of Cookery Competition. He had always had a good impression of Clear Wind Pavilion, and representing them in the competition was not a bad thing. Even if he didn't get the competition qualification from Clear Wind Pavilion this time, he would have found other ways.\n***\n*   **青出於藍 (qīng chū yú lán)**: Literally \"blue comes from indigo,\" meaning the student surpasses the teacher, or the younger generation excels beyond the older.\n**   **坐井觀天 (zuò jǐng guān tiān)**: Literally \"sitting in a well and looking at the sky,\" meaning having a narrow or limited outlook/perspective.",

    "content": "From a distance, he could already see the familiar spired building, and a warm feeling spontaneously arose within him. Gentle Ling'er kept flashing through his mind. He recalled those days in the library when he ceaselessly studied magical knowledge while Ling'er was quietly caring for him<sup>1</sup>. Yet, he had still made her sad. How could he let down such a good girl as Ling'er? Remembering Long Ling's tearful eyes, Nian Bing's heart couldn't help but ache sharply. Quickening his steps, Nian Bing soon arrived at the entrance of the Mage Guild. At the entrance, the two mages on guard duty looked much more energetic than before. Neat junior mage robes were worn on them, and both their spirit and demeanor were much stronger than before. Nian Bing had never seen these two mages before; evidently, they had only recently joined the Mage Guild.\n\n\"Hello, may I ask if you are a mage here to join the Guild?\" one of the mages on guard duty proactively asked.\n\nNian Bing shook his head, a flash of light in his hand, and he took out the token symbolizing his elder status. The two junior mages immediately saluted respectfully upon seeing the token, saying, \"Greetings, Elder. Please enter, Elder.\" Saying this, they cleared the path.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was about to walk inside, a familiar voice rang out, \"Oh, who are you?\" A tall, slender figure walked out from inside the Guild; it was Shi Jiu, whom he hadn't seen in days.\n\nNian Bing used his hand to push up his conical hat, smiling as he said, \"Brother Shi Jiu, don't you recognize me?\"\n\nThe two junior mages were simultaneously stunned upon seeing Nian Bing's young and handsome appearance, clearly not expecting this Elder to be so young.\n\nShi Jiu was also stunned when he saw Nian Bing. \"Nian Bing, you're back.\" His expression seemed a bit complex, but the light in his eyes was benevolent.\n\n\"Let's go, let's go in together.\" Shi Jiu stepped forward, patted Nian Bing's shoulder, and led him inside.\n\nAfter not seeing him for many days, Shi Jiu's demeanor seemed to have changed. This change wasn't solely due to an increase in his magical power; at the same time, Nian Bing's spiritual sense, granted by his Celestial Eye Acupoint, could clearly feel that Shi Jiu's aura seemed much calmer than before.\n\nAs they walked, Shi Jiu said to Nian Bing, \"Nian Bing, thank you.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"I am a part of the Guild. Bringing honor to the Guild is what I should do.\"\n\nShi Jiu shook his head and said, \"No. I don't mean that. I mean for Ling'er. Back then, after you left, I discovered something was wrong with Ling'er. Her former smile was gone. Watching her grow thinner day by day, I truly felt terrible. I had a heart-to-heart talk with her and only then learned that it was you, this kid, who had captured her heart. Nian Bing, do you know? At that time, I wished I could tear you to pieces. But what Ling'er said later made me understand many things. You don't need to ask what she told me. I can only tell you that now I regard Ling'er as my most precious sister. Although my magic is not as good as yours, if you dare to bully her in the future, I won't agree to it. Indeed, you are more suitable for her than I am. I am not worthy of her!\" Saying this, he stopped and looked at Nian Bing with a smile.\n\nNian Bing looked at Shi Jiu somewhat dazedly. After all, his change was too great, and he couldn't accept it for a moment. \"Brother Shi Jiu, I....\"\n\n\"Alright, don't say anything else. Just treat Ling'er well, and that's enough. Let's go in. Our teacher has been very worried about you! You rendered such great service to the Guild this time, which finally earned us the recognition of the Ice Moon Empire. Today, a distinguished guest has also arrived. It's good that you're back; you should meet them first, then go see Ling'er later.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. Out of courtesy, he also needed to see Long Zhi first upon his return. After listening to Shi Jiu's words, Nian Bing felt much more relaxed. Although he wasn't afraid of Shi Jiu, wasn't it better to turn an enemy into a friend? Besides, he had no real conflict with Shi Jiu in the first place.\n\nThe two quickly entered the Guild's main building. Shi Jiu excitedly led Nian Bing to the second-floor hall. \"Teacher, look who's back.\"\n\nNian Bing followed Shi Jiu upstairs. In the hall, two people were seated on the sofa, and one person was standing behind them. He knew both of the seated individuals: one was naturally Long Zhi, the Guild Master of the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild and a Wind-element Seeker Mage. The other was none other than Yan Yun, the Fifth Prince of the Ice Moon Empire, whom he had just recently met. Standing behind Yan Yun was an old man dressed in a deep blue robe. As soon as Nian Bing came upstairs, he felt a flash of sharp light in the old man's eyes. Through the perception of his Celestial Eye Acupoint, he immediately sensed the old man's extraordinary nature: a master, absolutely a master.\n\nLong Zhi, who had been speaking to Yan Yun with a smiling face, suddenly saw Nian Bing. He was stunned for a moment. Immediately after, there wasn't the joy Nian Bing had expected. Instead, there was a hint of awkwardness. Long Zhi stood up and said, \"Nian Bing, you're finally back.\"\n\nNian Bing glanced at Yan Yun, then bowed to Long Zhi and said, \"Teacher.\" Long Zhi coughed and said, \"Come, let me introduce you. This is...\" \"No need for introductions, Brother Nian Bing and I have already met.\" Yan Yun proactively stood up. He clearly understood Nian Bing's identity. \"I truly didn't expect that Brother Nian Bing is the genius mage who brought glory to my Ice Moon Empire!\" The surprise in his eyes was undeniable. Previously in Qingfeng Pavilion, he had clearly seen Nian Bing use his body to withstand over a hundred palms from Xue Jing. Could he have used magic to defend against those attacks?\n\nNian Bing said, \"Greetings, Fifth Prince.\"\n\nYan Yun raised an eyebrow. \"Oh, so Brother Nian Bing already knows my identity. Actually, identity is something given by my imperial father. We can interact as peers.\" He was currently competing for the throne with two other princes, so he naturally yearned for talented individuals. As soon as he discovered Nian Bing was the one who had won the Five Nations New Mage Competition, his tone immediately became much more polite.\n\nLong Zhi frowned slightly, looking at Nian Bing and saying, \"So you two already know each other, that's excellent. Nian Bing, you've just returned and must be tired from your journey. I'll come find you later. Shi Jiu, take Nian Bing downstairs to rest.\"\n\nAlthough Nian Bing felt strange inside, he didn't say much. He also wanted to go see Ling'er and wasn't willing to delay here, after all. In his opinion, Long Zhi and Yan Yun were surely discussing political matters. Those were things he had no interest in.\n\nJust then, a sentence Yan Yun uttered stirred up a raging storm in Nian Bing's heart. \"Guild Master Long, since our matter has been settled, I'll take my leave first. I happen to want to ask Mage Nian Bing about the situation during the competition. The date of my marriage with Miss Ling'er will be announced to you as soon as possible after I return and discuss it with my imperial father.\"\n\n\"What? You're marrying Ling'er?\" Shi Jiu exclaimed.\n\nLong Zhi said in a deep voice, \"Shi Jiu, don't be rude.\" As he admonished Shi Jiu, he saw Nian Bing's face instantly turn cold.\n\nYan Yun smiled slightly and said, \"Indeed, I have long heard that Miss Ling'er is gentle and charming. It is my honor to be united with Miss Ling'er in marriage.\"\n\nNian Bing met Yan Yun's gaze directly, smiled faintly, and said, \"I'm truly sorry. Fifth Prince, Ling'er is my fiancée, so how could she be united in marriage with you?\"\n\nYan Yun was stunned and couldn't help but turn his gaze to Long Zhi. Long Zhi said somewhat exasperatedly, \"Nian Bing, don't talk nonsense. When did Ling'er become your fiancée? You go downstairs first. Fifth Prince, this is just a misunderstanding. Please don't take it to heart.\"\n\nYan Yun looked at Long Zhi, then at Nian Bing, frowned slightly, and said, \"I don't care if this matter is a misunderstanding or not, but I ask Guild Master Long to resolve it as soon as possible. Otherwise, it will be difficult to explain to my imperial father. Alright, you handle your own household matters. Yan Yun takes his leave.\" Saying this, he walked past Nian Bing and headed outside.\n\nJust as Yan Yun was about to pass Nian Bing, an unexpected change occurred. Seven-colored light burst forth from Nian Bing's body without any warning. Yan Yun's body seemed to solidify, instantly halting. How could the Innate Domain, which could even contend with Dragon King-level masters, be something he could compare to? Seven beams of light simultaneously illuminated, and seven magical blades, each with a different aura, were simultaneously placed at Yan Yun's vital points. In an instant, Yan Yun's body dared not move an inch. The intense killing intent from the Seven Blades<sup>2</sup> caused his heart to tremble violently, and he couldn't even speak.\n\nThe blue-robed old man saw Yan Yun suddenly being restrained, and was greatly alarmed. He took a staggered step and rushed towards Nian Bing. A flash of intimidating light appeared in Nian Bing's eyes, and the Seven Blades shone brightly. A surging aura flowed forth. Although he didn't utter a single word, the blue-robed old man stopped abruptly when he was still a zhang (approx. 3.3 meters) away from him, not advancing another step.\n\nThe Celestial Eye Domain Nian Bing released was extremely subtle, perfectly enveloping him and Fifth Prince Yan Yun. In a cold voice, he uttered word by word, \"I don't care what your status is, nor who you are. Remember my words. If you dare to covet Ling'er again, then the next time we meet, your body will be in pieces. Also, go back and tell your old man that I have no interest whatsoever in being a court imperial chef. If you want to capture me, then I'll give you a suggestion: invite the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess.\" The light vanished simultaneously, as if nothing had happened. Yan Yun stumbled forward a few steps. His eyes were filled with horror. In that instant, he clearly felt death was astonishingly close to him.\n\nThe blue-robed old man roared, and his body shot like lightning towards Nian Bing. Silver light burst forth; it was indeed Saint Battle Qi of the Martial Saint level.\n\nIf it were before, even if Nian Bing had obtained the seven magical blades, it would have been difficult for him to contend with a Martial Saint at such close range. However, he was no longer the Nian Bing of before. The gradual mastery of his Ice-Fire Co-source Magic, coupled with the activation of his Celestial Eye Acupoint, had already placed him among the continent's top mages. The distance of one zhang suddenly seemed so far in front of the blue-robed old man. His surroundings were completely enveloped by seven-colored brilliance, and seven shadows appeared before him. Each ray of light was so real, yet so illusory. Seven ghost-like figures crossed past him. The blue-robed old man only felt a chill throughout his body, and the battle qi within him could not be gathered at all.\n\nThe ten-colored light vanished again. Nian Bing walked step by step to the blue-robed old man who stood frozen in place. He said calmly, \"You're so old, why bother selling your life for others? I don't want to kill, so you're lucky. I've sealed your meridians with seven types of magic power; they will naturally dissipate in a month. Take your master and leave.\"\n\nYuewang\n\nBut, within the Celestial Eye Domain, Nian Bing could clearly grasp the opponent's battle qi attributes. Under the effect of weakening battle qi, and then sealing it with magic power that completely countered it, the best effect could be achieved instantly. For a Martial Saint-level master to contend with Nian Bing, the first thing is not to be enveloped by his domain. Otherwise, they would have no chance.\n\nThe blue-robed old man and Yan Yun left. Yan Yun's gaze as he departed was very strange. But Nian Bing, relying on the spiritual sense from his Celestial Eye Acupoint, still easily detected the sinister aura emanating from him. However, these things were no longer important to him. To protect Ling'er, he didn't care who he made an enemy of. After years of forbearance, he finally possessed the strength to establish himself on the continent. He knew very well what he should do.\n\n\"Nian Bing, what have you done? Do you know how important this opportunity is to the Guild?\" Long Zhi roared.\n\nNian Bing turned and looked at Long Zhi, his gaze somewhat cold. He nodded and said, \"Of course, I understand how important this is to the Guild. To the Guild, I am merely a usable pawn. Perhaps even you yourself didn't expect that I would actually win first place in the competition. With my first-place victory, the Guild's status in the Ice Moon Empire was immediately greatly elevated. This opportunity is truly rare for you, who have always been dedicated to developing the Guild. But in the end, I am just a pawn. Even if my magic is powerful enough to bring greater fame to the Guild, I am merely your disciple, a mage. Compared to that Fifth Prince who has a good chance of inheriting the throne, what am I? If you can cling to that high branch, once he becomes the master of the Ice Moon Empire, the benefits for the Mage Guild would naturally be immense. Under the influence of nepotism, the Mage Guild might very well catch up to the status of Ice God Tower. After all, Ice God Tower is not entirely controlled by the Ice Moon Empire. This is a process of mutual utilization. As long as this political marriage succeeds, then you can become the future *guo zhang*<sup>3</sup>. The Mage Guild can also truly establish deep roots in the Ice Moon Empire, and might even become the most powerful Mage Guild on the continent. Am I right, my teacher?\"\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> Original text \"歌默的照顧著自己\" (gēmò de zhàogùzhe zìjǐ) likely contains a typo for \"默默地照顧著自己\" (mòmò de zhàogùzhe zìjǐ), meaning \"quietly/silently caring for him/herself.\"\n<sup>2</sup> Original text \"七棲刀\" (qīqīdāo).

    "content": "Watching Nian Bing's pure, cerulean gaze, Long Zhi felt a pang of guilt. Indeed, in his heart, though Nian Bing was important, how could he compare to the powerful Fifth Prince? The Fifth Prince's proposal today had delighted him, yet he never expected Nian Bing to return at this critical, inescapable juncture, and moreover, with a power far exceeding his expectations, almost killing the Fifth Prince. Shi Jiu didn't know what Nian Bing had used, and perhaps the Fifth Prince and that blue-robed elder didn't either, but how could he, an Archmage, not recognize it? That was clearly the Innate Domain, representing an Archmage! And it was an Innate Domain simultaneously possessing seven different magical auras. Nian Bing's strength and his utterly reckless actions had already thrown him into disarray. Offending the Fifth Prince would undoubtedly be a disaster for the Ice Moon Empire Mage Guild. But could he, at this moment, punish Nian Bing, who had brought such immense honor to the Guild?\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and continued, \"Have you ever considered something, Master? You only have one daughter, Ling'er. Aren't you concerned for her happiness?\"\n\nA cold glint flashed in Long Zhi's eyes. \"Nonsense. To be able to marry into the royal family is something countless people dream of. The Fifth Prince is naturally intelligent and a man of fine talent. Ling'er will surely be happy with him. Nian Bing, you've never shown me any affection for Ling'er before. What is the meaning of your actions today?\"\n\nNian Bing sighed. \"Yes, I have wronged Ling'er. I once failed her. But the same thing will absolutely not happen again. Ling'er can only be mine; there is no doubt about that. Master, do you know why Miss Luo Rou left the Ice Moon Empire? You don't, do you? But I do. Because she saw very far. Marrying into the royal family is, of course, a good thing for power, but for a girl, it is the beginning of sorrow. With someone of Yan Yun's status, who knows how many wives and concubines he will have in the future? Even if Ling'er gains his favor for a time, can she truly keep Yan Yun's love forever? The answer is no. Once one enters the palace gates, it's like the deep sea. You cannot possibly not understand this principle, yet you deliberately ignored this issue because of the power the Fifth Prince might bring you. You are Ling'er's father, and she is your only daughter!\"\n\n\"That's right, Master, Nian Bing has a point. Please reconsider,\" Shi Jiu said from the side.\n\nLong Zhi glared at Shi Jiu. \"You go downstairs first. You don't need to speak here.\"\n\nShi Jiu wanted to say more but ultimately held back. He turned and walked downstairs, giving Nian Bing an encouraging look before he left.\n\nWith Shi Jiu gone, Long Zhi's voice softened a little. \"Nian Bing, do you truly love Ling'er?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded firmly. \"Yes. One of the most important reasons for my return this time is to establish my relationship with Ling'er. I am sincere, and Ling'er is as well. I hope you can entrust her to me.\"\n\nLong Zhi said indifferently, \"But, if I remember correctly, you still have an unavenged hatred. A child's parents' revenge cannot exist under the same sky. Even if your strength has increased somewhat, can you be a match for the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess? If I agree to let Ling'er be with you and you die in your pursuit of revenge in the future, how can my daughter be happy? You are right; I am willing to do anything to strengthen the Guild. My two greatest wishes in life are to become a Spirit Descender and to make the Guild the foremost mage guild on the continent. Ling'er is my daughter; she has always supported me since she was little. I think this time will be no exception. Moreover, though what you said might happen, I believe that with Ling'er's character, she might not be unable to secure the Fifth Prince's heart. Nian Bing, don't forget that you are a member of the Mage Guild. For the sake of the Guild, I hope you can make some sacrifices. I once promised you that in the near future, my position would be yours. That promise still stands. This time, you have rendered such great service to the Guild and have powerful strength as your backing... I am currently preparing to appoint you as the Guild's Vice-President.\"\n\nNian Bing's emotions surged, and he cried out, \"Master, do you think I am someone who pursues only profit? I can solemnly tell you that I have never had any thoughts about power. The Guild President's position is not important to me, but Ling'er is one of the most important people in my heart. You don't need to say more. Under no circumstances will I give up on Ling'er. These past few days, I've thought it all through. I am willing to give Ling'er a warm home. I cannot guarantee that I will be a perfect husband, but I can guarantee that I will love Ling'er with all my heart and soul. I will absolutely not give up a good girl like Ling'er.\"\n\nHe spoke these words with absolute resolve, leaving no room for negotiation in his relationship with Long Zhi. His meaning was clear: he was telling Long Zhi that no matter what means he used, he would never give up on Ling'er.\n\nLong Zhi's gaze grew cold. \"So, you are determined to disrupt this matter? Nian Bing, Nian Bing, don't forget, I am the President of the Ice Moon Empire Mage Guild, and Ling'er is also my daughter.\"\n\nThe corner of Nian Bing's mouth turned up, and a hint of disdain appeared in his eyes. \"That's right, you are Ling'er's father, but you are also a father who can disregard his daughter's happiness. I love Ling'er, and I will not allow anyone to hurt her. I do not want to see her cry again. I want to see a smile on her face every day. Master, perhaps this is the last time I will address you as such. When I first entered the continent, you gave me a lot of help, but I also helped the Guild gain renown. You and I can be said to owe each other nothing. I no longer wish to be a Guild Elder. If you wish to deal with me, then use whatever means you wish; I will accept it.\" As he spoke, he took out the Elder identification token from his Spatial Ring and threw it to the ground, meeting Long Zhi's gaze without flinching.\n\n\"Your wings have grown strong; you no longer even recognize your master. Good, good, good, good. Then I would like to experience your abilities. You can defeat a Martial Saint; let's see if you can defeat an Archmage. If you kill me, no one will stop you.\"\n\nAzure airflow swirled around Long Zhi's body. The Wind of Freedom transformed into a raging gale, continuously wreaking havoc. Long Zhi had immersed himself in wind magic for decades, and his magical cultivation was such that even the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess had some reservations about him; his strength was beyond doubt.\n\nJust then, a sobbing voice rang out. \"No, Father, please don't fight Nian Bing!\" A blue figure quickly ran upstairs. Dressed in a blue mage robe, with long purple hair, her helpless large eyes filled with panic, her pretty face looked somewhat pale, and her body seemed even thinner than before. It was none other than the gentle girl, Long Ling.\n\n\"Ling'er!\" Nian Bing and Long Zhi spoke almost simultaneously.\n\nNian Bing strode forward, and disregarding Long Zhi's presence, he pulled Long Ling's delicate body into his embrace. Feeling her frail form and her rapid heartbeat, Nian Bing's eyes blurred. This girl, who had silently loved him and bitterly longed for him, was so moving in his eyes now. Nian Bing knew that he would never, ever again let Long Ling down, never.\n\nSuddenly embraced by Nian Bing, Long Ling was startled, but soon, that familiar and warm chest enveloped her heart. This sudden hug proved everything to her; her bitter wait had finally brought back the one she longed for. Tears of emotion streamed from her eyes. She wrapped her arms tightly around Nian Bing's waist, terribly afraid that this was all just a dream.\n\nNian Bing held Long Ling, letting her cry in his arms. He knew that at this moment, letting Ling'er cry out all the grievances in her heart would be good for her. His gaze fell upon Long Zhi, whose expression flickered, and he looked at him calmly.\n\nLong Zhi secretly thought, *That Shi Jiu is so meddlesome. Why did he call Ling'er over?*\n\nAfter a while, Long Ling remembered why she had come. She quickly broke free from Nian Bing's embrace and wiped away her tears with her sleeve. \"Father, do you… do you really want me to marry that Fifth Prince?\"\n\nLong Zhi looked at his tearful daughter, and his heart immediately softened. \"Ling'er, you also know this is the best opportunity for our Guild. Moreover, the Fifth Prince is far-sighted and of good character, and his appearance matches yours. What's wrong with that?\"\n\nLong Ling looked at her father. Since childhood, she had always known how much her father had sacrificed for the Ice Moon Empire Mage Guild. As a child, she had secretly vowed that when she grew up, she would diligently cultivate magic and try to help her father more. But now, on one side was her father, and on the other was the man she deeply loved. Both sides were dear to her, so how could she choose?¹\n\nNian Bing put his arm around Ling'er's waist from behind, saying tenderly, \"Ling'er, why have you lost weight again? Have you not been eating well often?\" He seemed to have forgotten the awkwardness of the current situation, looking at Long Ling with concern.\n\nFeeling the warmth of Nian Bing's large hand, Long Ling's heart steadied a bit. She looked back at him, her worry deepening. If not for Nian Bing, she would have obediently agreed to her father's request, for this was her father's only hope! But after years of yearning for Nian Bing, she had finally seen a glimmer of hope. Her conflicted heart made her shed tears again.\n\nSeeing Long Ling's appearance, Nian Bing knew he had no choice. For Ling'er's sake, he absolutely could not fall out with Long Zhi. Long Zhi was too important in Long Ling's heart. He simply couldn't take Ling'er and leave, as she would never truly be happy that way. Thinking of this, Nian Bing had made his decision. He looked at Long Zhi and said, \"I understand your wish. If it were just me, I might do something extreme, but for Ling'er's sake, you are still my master. Your wish is to make the Ice Moon Empire Mage Guild strong. Good, I'll help you. I think what you want is not the Fifth Prince's support, but the support of the future King of the Ice Moon Empire. If I can get the future King to support your Guild's development, then I think you won't need to marry Ling'er to that Fifth Prince.\"\n\nLong Zhi looked at the wise gleam in Nian Bing's eyes, his thoughts racing. Suddenly, his eyes flashed, and he said somewhat eagerly, \"You... are you going to support the First Prince or the Second Prince?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"No, I'm not interested in those unfamiliar people. Master, let's make a bet on the future King of the Ice Moon Empire. You can agree to the Fifth Prince's relationship with Ling'er, but you must propose a condition: he can only marry Ling'er if he becomes King. It is said that the current King of the Ice Moon Empire doesn't have many days left to live, so I think the next King should also be decided soon.\"\n\nLong Zhi's breathing quickened. \"Nian Bing, can you alone influence the political changes in the Ice Moon Empire? You must understand that in this matter, I will give you no support whatsoever. Although our Guild's status is stronger than before, it has only just begun to rise. Compared to the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, who can influence the entire political situation, we are still too far behind. You are merely an Archmage; you have only won a competition, but you have no power to speak of. Based on your single statement, you want me to reject the Fifth Prince?\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"Of course, for Ling'er's sake, you cannot side with the wrong faction. But, also for Ling'er's sake, why don't you give me a chance? I said you can first agree to the Fifth Prince's marriage to Ling'er and promise to fully support him in ascending the throne, but only after he truly ascends to that position can Ling'er marry him. Perhaps doing so will cause the Fifth Prince to hold some grudge against you, but similarly, if it successfully fulfills its promise, won't you gain greater benefits? Master, this bet has no loss for you.\"\n\nLong Zhi frowned, his eyes flashing continuously. He was hesitating. Long Ling looked at her father, then at the man she loved. Her emotions at this moment were extremely complex, and she subconsciously squeezed Nian Bing's large hand.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Master, let's go to the testing area. I'd like to spar with you again.\"\n\nLong Zhi was startled. \"You want to spar with me in magic?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"That's right. I want to prove to you that I already have enough ability to protect Ling'er. Actually, if it weren't for Ling'er's feelings, I could take her and leave this place, never to return. In that case, you would have even less explanation to give to the Fifth Prince. I think if I am determined to take Ling'er, no one can stop me.\"\n\nLong Zhi narrowed his eyes, a sharp glint flashing through them. \"After a year apart, Nian Bing, you've changed.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Strength gives confidence.\"\n\n\"Just with your Innate Domain?\" Long Zhi was somewhat disdainful. Although he was also surprised by Nian Bing's Innate Domain, an Innate Domain couldn't represent everything. After all, real combat was different from competitions; there were also things like Magic Scrolls that could instantly cast spells. Moreover, Long Zhi himself had been an Archmage for many years. He simply couldn't believe that Nian Bing could defeat him with the strength of an Archmage.\n\n\"How would you know without trying?\" Nian Bing looked at Long Zhi calmly.\n\n\"Alright, as long as you can defeat me, I will agree to your conditions. Although our Guild is weak, it won't be difficult to keep Ling'er safe until the day the Fifth Prince ascends the throne.\" Having said that, he led the way out.\n\nWatching her father go downstairs, Long Ling looked at Nian Bing gratefully. \"It's all because of me, Nian Bing, you...\"\n\nNian Bing took Long Ling's hand and lightly kissed it. \"Ling'er, don't think about anything, okay? Let me handle everything. Since I want to be your man, I must remove all your troubles. Unless I die, I will never let you marry anyone else. Alright, let's go too.\"\n\nThe Magic Testing Hall had strong restrictions. Nian Bing had once had his magical strength tested there. Nian Bing asked Long Ling to wait outside and followed Long Zhi into the hall. The familiar magical seals and active magical elements made him enter a state of still waters in an ancient well.² He was someone who disliked trouble, but for the sake of the Ling'er he deeply loved, no matter how troublesome, he had to do it. He had vowed to never let Long Ling cry again because of him.\n\nLong Zhi stood in the center of the large hall, waiting for Nian Bing's arrival. Faint azure light continuously flickered around his body. In his hand, he had secretly gripped three Magic Scrolls. Although he knew Nian Bing's magical power was not as strong as his own, he dared not be careless about the advantage of the Innate Domain's instant casting. An Archmage with an Innate Domain was very rare; even he himself had only heard of it. Until he understood what abilities Nian Bing's Innate Domain possessed, he had to be cautious.\n\nNian Bing stopped thirty-three meters away from Long Zhi. The Spatial Ring on his left hand, given to him by Long Zhi, flashed, and his hat was put away. His white hair flowed down, spreading over his shoulders.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing's white hair, Long Zhi couldn't help but be stunned. Suddenly, he seemed to understand something and said in horror, \"Nian Bing, you actually used that spell I taught you?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Yes, I used it. For a friend, I had to curse my own life to gain greater power. You don't need to be surprised; my life force has completely returned to normal. Only this hair can never turn back to its original color. Since leaving Ice and Snow City, I've experienced many things. Some things, even I haven't fully understood yet.\"\n\nHe was naturally referring to his fusion with Oscar, the Little Dragon King. Oscar was currently sleeping in his liver area. A strange energy protected all his internal organs, including his heart. His already powerful dragon body, combined with Oscar's energy, meant his physical defense was absolutely no less than that of a Martial Saint.\n\nLong Zhi smiled faintly. \"Alright then, I want to see what you've learned these past days, daring to challenge your own master.\" The azure light instantly grew stronger. The overly condensed wind elements emitted a whistling sound.\n\nNian Bing didn't move; he just calmly watched Long Zhi. He knew that Long Zhi, as his master, certainly wouldn't attack first. He pinched his fingers together, and an ice cone floated out. Immediately after, in a faint silver light, the ice cone vanished. Just as Long Zhi was startled, the ice cone suddenly appeared one meter in front of him. A blue light flashed, instantly accelerating, and in the blink of an eye, it had reached his chest.\n\nLong Zhi was greatly alarmed. Azure light churned around his chest, shattering the ice cone. However, he found himself breaking out in a cold sweat. Although he had long thought Nian Bing was strong in magic control, he never expected him to be so strong. A simple ice cone released from his hand could produce such a strange attack. The previous silver and blue lights clearly carried the aura of spatial magic and wind magic!\n\nBefore leaving Cold Ridge, Nian Bing had deliberately sparred seriously with several Dragon Kings. Through his battle with the Lich Xie Yue, his understanding of magic had deepened by another layer. Especially after he could activate imitative magic without needing the seven magic blades, his control over the seven elements of magic had reached a new height. More importantly, after his rebirth, when all his energy stabilized, he was no longer merely an Archmage, but the first all-element Archmage in the history of the Yangon Continent. Perhaps in terms of single-element magical power, he was inferior to Long Zhi, who had immersed himself in magic for many years, but what he possessed was seven-element magic based on Ice and Fire Coexistence!\n\nNian Bing acted as if he had done nothing, calmly looking at Long Zhi. \"Master, we can officially begin.\"\n\nLong Zhi's heart twitched. He murmured a few incantations, and a wind barrier with a fierce gust of wind suddenly appeared before him. Nian Bing's sneak attack magic, relying on Instant Movement and Wind Acceleration, had greatly increased his vigilance.\n\nNian Bing understood that if he wanted Long Zhi to have confidence in him, he first had to have confidence in his own strength. With a seven-colored glow, the Heavenly Eye Domain gracefully floated out, surrounding Nian Bing's body within thirty centimeters. Seven shadow puppets appeared before him. These seven shadow puppets were not instantly cast by Nian Bing, but summoned by him previously. Since fundamentally understanding the abilities of the seven magic blades, Nian Bing, using his knowledge of magic arrays, had attached each of his summoned seven shadow puppets to one of the seven divine blades. Among the seven shadow puppets, the most powerful were the two puppets with the strongest ice and fire magic foundations. But the most mysterious was the Dark Shadow Puppet, which had absorbed part of the dark magic power from the Vampire Queen. Even Nian Bing himself was now somewhat unclear about the extent of his Dark Shadow Puppet's abilities.\n\n\"Master, use your strongest magic. You only have one chance.\"\n\nAlthough Nian Bing's tone was calm, it gave Long Zhi a strange feeling, as if Nian Bing were the master now. His anger surging, Long Zhi sneered, \"Nian Bing, although your wings have grown strong, your vision is also narrow. Very well, I'll show you your master's true strength.\" The entire room suddenly distorted. Amidst the distortion, the hall instantly lit up, completely engulfed in azure light. Long Zhi held a magic staff in his hand. The staff's tip was spiraled, inlaid with three azure gemstones. Nian Bing naturally recognized the gemstones; they were the same Wind Chant Stones as on his Ao Tian Blade.\n\nHis heart startled, his Heavenly Eye opened instantly. All energy changes became exceptionally clear through the Heavenly Eye. Upon observation, Nian Bing found that although the gemstones on the staff were also Wind Chant Stones, their quality was slightly inferior to the one on his Ao Tian Blade. But even so, the wind element aura emanating from the magic staff became extremely dense.\n\nLong Zhi's incantation became very low, but it was rhythmic, subtly aligning with the howling wind in the hall. Of course, he didn't know that this was Long Zhi's renowned special incantation method, the Wind Chant Language. With the effect of the Wind Chant Language, he could shorten the incantation time by one-third when casting spells. For a powerful Archmage, reducing the incantation time was definitely a mark of increased strength.\n\nCountless distorted wind blades danced in the space. Under the effect of the azure light, Nian Bing could no longer see Long Zhi's figure. However, he could clearly feel Long Zhi's position, but that spot had already become the center of a storm. *Such strong magical power.* Nian Bing couldn't help but be secretly astonished. Although he had also entered the Archmage realm, his magical power was still far less than Long Zhi's. Even among Archmages, there were differences in strength.\n\nNian Bing did not move; he waited quietly, waiting for Long Zhi to raise his aura to its limit. The seven shadow puppets he had prepared beforehand were his greatest advantage. With these seven shadow puppets, he had the initiative in both offense and defense.\n\nCountless azure wind blades converged into a long river of wind blades, forming a beautiful arc as they swept towards Nian Bing. Nian Bing didn't move. He knew, of course, that this was just Long Zhi's first wave of attack. He wanted to test the defensive power of his Innate Domain. The reason he only released a thirty-centimeter Innate Domain at the outset was not because Nian Bing underestimated Long Zhi, but precisely because he took Long Zhi seriously. The power of an Innate Domain was greatly related to its concentration. The smaller the released range, the stronger the concentration could be under control, and thus the greater the power. Having no attack was the Heavenly Eye Domain's greatest flaw; likewise, this was also its greatest advantage. Without an attack, under its defensive and amplification effects, the Heavenly Eye Domain far surpassed other Innate Domains.\n\nAt least dozens of azure wind blades indiscriminately rushed into the thirty-centimeter domain. With Long Zhi's Archmage strength, the wind blades he released were naturally not as simple as ordinary wind blades. Each wind blade had the attack power of a third-tier spell or higher. Dozens of third-tier spell attacks in an instant, especially when attacking a single target, definitely had the power of a sixth-tier or higher spell.\n\nHowever, when these third-tier spells entered the Heavenly Eye Domain, they melted away like ice and snow. The seven-colored halo continuously fluctuated, with the azure light flickering on and off. Each wind blade's impact, upon entering the domain, immediately transformed into wind element energy within the domain. Not only did it not cause destructive effects, but it was instead utilized by Nian Bing. Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye Domain naturally couldn't absorb excessive wind magic power, but the wind-element shadow puppet could. Its light, which was originally not prominent, became much more substantial after receiving hundreds of wind blade energies converted by Nian Bing through the innate aura. Without exceeding the Heavenly Eye Domain's absolute energy, attacks would only be dissolved by the Heavenly Eye Domain. This was the advantage of the Heavenly Eye Domain. Weakening and amplification proceeded simultaneously, requiring absolutely no deviation in energy control. Under the effect of the Heavenly Eye, Nian Bing achieved it.\n\nThe wind blades did not continue to attack. A gigantic azure light phantom vaguely appeared between Nian Bing and Long Zhi. Nian Bing's heart stirred, and he immediately recognized it: this was the tenth-tier wind magic, Wind God's Summon. This was, after all, the Mage Guild. Long Zhi did not dare to unleash an eleventh-tier forbidden spell with all his might; otherwise, when the energy reached a level he could no longer control, it would inevitably cause immense damage to the entire Mage Guild. Therefore, he had to be cautious.\n\nA golden light appeared on the forehead of the gigantic azure phantom. As the light flickered, streaks of azure lightning flashed, and the massive figure gradually became clearer. Although its face was extremely blurry, the aura of the Wind God brought immense pressure, forcing Nian Bing to retreat a few steps and expand his Heavenly Eye Domain to three meters to resist this immense pressure. He couldn't help but admire Long Zhi in his heart. He knew that with his own ability, he couldn't possibly cast a tenth-tier spell so quickly. Long Zhi truly deserved his reputation as a long-standing Archmage; his application of wind magic had reached a critical point. With just one more final breakthrough, he could enter the realm of a Spirit Descender. Unfortunately, he was not yet a Spirit Descender.\n\nFacing the forming tenth-tier spell, Nian Bing dared not wait any longer. The Heavenly Eye Domain's coverage continued to expand, instantly enveloping the seven shadow puppets. The amplification effect was activated to its maximum. With a pull of his hands in front of him, his Heavenly Eye fully opened, and a light instantly bloomed from his glabella. \"Seven Blades Combined, Heavenly Eye Slash!\" The seven shadow puppets instantly aligned in a row. All seven magic blades were simultaneously raised high. The foremost was the Zheng Yang Blade of the God of Flame, followed by the Chen Lu Blade, Ao Tian Blade, Chang Sheng Blade, Xuan Ji Blade, Sheng Yao Blade, and Shi Mo Blade. Seven different lights converged at a single point. The seven shadow puppets made the same motion. The Heavenly Eye Slash did not cleave out a single light blade, but rather a condensed, seven-colored light sphere. The light sphere's radiance was extremely strange; it was not composed of seven distinct colors, but continuously flickered, changing to another color with each flicker. The fist-sized light sphere floated out, accurately locking onto the forehead of the Wind God summoned by Long Zhi, identified by the Heavenly Eye. He knew that was the Wind God's strongest point and also its most crucial point.\n\nThe full activation of the Heavenly Eye brought Nian Bing's mental power to an unprecedented height. Ice and Fire were already his strengths, and with the amplified seven shadow puppets and the wind-element shadow puppet, their power far exceeded what they had achieved when facing the Earth Dragon King Fatty. The light orb from the Heavenly Eye Slash was much smaller than last time, but the speed at which the seven colors changed was more than twice as fast.\n\n---\n¹ **手心手背都是肉 (shǒuxīn shǒubèi dōushì ròu)**: Literally \"the palm and back of the hand are both flesh.\" This idiom means that both sides are equally important or dear, making it difficult to choose between them, similar to being \"caught between a rock and a hard place.\"\n² **古井不波的境界 (gǔjǐng bùbō de jìngjiè)**: Literally \"a state of still waters in an ancient well.\" This idiom describes a state of mind that is perfectly calm, undisturbed, and unruffled, like the water in a very old, deep well that remains perfectly still.",

    "title": "Chapter 135: The Heavenly Eye Breaking the Wind Spirit (Part 1) (Part 2)",
    "content": "The seven Shadow Puppets swiftly retreated to Nianbing's side after delivering a blow. This was the difference. They did not disappear after unleashing the Heaven's Eye Slash. This was Nianbing's improvement. He had, after the seven Shadow Puppets launched their attack, immediately supplemented them with seven streams of Innate Qi, controlling them to absorb the surrounding Innate Qi using their own Innate Qi.\n\nOne person's absorption of Innate Qi could never compare to eight. Since acquiring the Innate Domain, not only did he not become complacent due to his increased strength, but he worked harder every day than before. He even set aside his beloved culinary arts, dedicating himself wholeheartedly to magic cultivation. Every day, apart from essential duties, he would allocate seventy percent of his remaining time to cultivating magic power, and thirty percent to practicing various magic controls, mentally simulating enemy attacks and defenses, and then countering them using his imagination. The closer his strength approached his goal, the Ice Goddess Priestess, the more diligent he became. Qianhuan Bingyun said his parents weren't dead, and to rescue them, he could only rely on himself. Everyone could only truly trust themselves.\n\nThe seven elemental magic energies, under the subtle control of the mental power emitted from his Heaven's Eye Acupoint, quickly formed a delicate balance. In this balance, the seven magic elements existed entirely in a mutually generative state. Under their complementary effect, the magic power was instantly maximized, and in a blink of an eye, it had arrived before the Wind God summoned by Long Zhi.\n\nThe wind magic, unleashed to its strongest in an instant surge, from that enormous figure shot out a bolt of azure lightning, striking Nianbing's Heaven's Eye Slash with sudden force. However, the Heaven's Eye Slash's strength lay in the fact that it was, in itself, a miniature Heaven's Eye Domain. Although its volume was small, the concentrated energy within it was extraordinarily terrifying. The lightning's speed was even faster than Nianbing's thoughts, therefore, he had no time to control the Heaven's Eye Slash to dodge, but the Heaven's Eye Slash's inherent formidable power was not something this azure lightning could destroy.\n\nLong Ling waited anxiously outside. Although this hall, specifically designed for testing magicians' ranks, possessed powerful magic seals for defense, she could still clearly feel the surging magic elements within. Just as she was at a loss, a familiar call suddenly echoed in her heart. \"Ling'er, quickly retreat.\" The voice was Nianbing's. Long Ling didn't know why Nianbing's voice appeared in her heart, but with her trust in Nianbing, she didn't hesitate at all and immediately ran into the distance.\n\nJust as Long Ling had run out more than ten zhang*, the magic seals of the entire testing hall collapsed.\nBoom—, a strong seven-colored radiance, surrounding a bolt of azure light, shot into the sky. It soared straight into the heavens. Most bizarrely, the clouds originally directly above the Magicians' Guild vanished in large swathes, turning the somewhat gloomy sky into a clear blue, with sunlight illuminating the earth and enveloping the entire Magicians' Guild.\n\nIn the violent explosion, the entire magic hall vanished in an instant. The two spire-topped buildings connected to the hall collapsed with a roar. When the surging dust came into contact with the seven-colored light pillar, it too disappeared.\n\nLong Ling subconsciously released a Sixth-Tier Magic Scroll that Nianbing had given her earlier. Instead of directly contending with the enormous shockwave, she used its force to float gracefully away. Even so, the immense oppressive force nearly suffocated her. The sudden energy was truly immense. Fortunately, this energy was directed entirely upwards, otherwise, destroying the entire Magicians' Guild would not have been impossible.\n\nThe sudden appearance of the strange phenomenon immediately drew the attention of everyone in Ice Snow City. Everyone's gaze turned towards the Ice Moon Empire Magicians' Guild. It wasn't until the next day that they heard the Magicians' Guild's explanation, which claimed the explosion was caused by a magic experiment. Of course, this explanation was far-fetched, but even if the explanation was weak, the immense energy was undeniably real. Some attentive individuals immediately re-evaluated the Magicians' Guild's strength. That kind of energy fluctuation was definitely Forbidden Spell-level energy. Yet, the energy unleashed during the explosion consisted of seven magic elements, and it hadn't destroyed the Magicians' Guild. This was absolutely not an effect that seven Arch-Magicians could produce. Everyone knew that the Ice Moon Empire Magicians' Guild only had one Arch-Magician. However, this sudden explosion, an explosion capable of altering astronomical phenomena, made the Magicians' Guild appear even more mysterious in people's minds. Especially combined with the recent achievements of the Ice Moon Empire Magicians' Guild representative in the Five Nations' Rising Star Magician Competition, it naturally led to wild conjectures among some.\n\nEverything became quiet again. Dozens of magicians rushed out from the surrounding buildings. The two buildings on either side of the testing hall were originally magic laboratories. Recently, due to funding from the Ice Moon Empire, they were preparing for renovation, and everything inside had been moved out. Thus, although the explosion was violent, it did not cause any casualties. The only losses were these three buildings.\n\nNianbing was still as he had been. His long white hair cascaded over his shoulders, gently swaying. The seven Shadow Puppets, each holding a Magic Divine Blade, circled around him. Under the cover of the Heaven's Eye Domain, these constantly moving Shadow Puppets could only be seen as blurry phantoms.\n\nLong Zhi was also unharmed. He stood there, fixedly gazing at Nianbing, not far in front of him. Everything around them had vanished, even the ground beneath their feet had turned to powder. Vast magic energy dispersed wildly amidst the rampage, two colliding energy masses unleashing an impact greater than that of a Forbidden Spell. Long Zhi knew very well that at the last moment, it was Nianbing who, with his incredibly vast mental power, changed the direction of the explosion's shockwave, thus preventing irreparable damage to the Magicians' Guild.\n\n\"Ah! Nianbing, you're back?\" As a senior elder of the Guild, Lidun's face immediately lit up with surprise and joy upon seeing Nianbing.\n\nNianbing looked at Arch-Magician Lidun, who had walked to his side, and smiled slightly, saying, \"Hello, Teacher Lidun. I just returned not long ago. Teacher wanted to test my recent magical proficiency, and he also said that due to our Guild's expansion, this testing hall needed to be rebuilt. To avoid the trouble of demolition, we simply combined our magic to tear it down. Teacher, am I right?\"\n\nLong Zhi coughed, suppressing the persistent feeling of weakness, walked to Nianbing's side, nodded, and said, \"Indeed. Elder Lidun, from now on, I appoint Nianbing as the Vice-President of this Guild. His strength has already reached the Arch-Magician realm. I believe the position of Vice-President is very suitable for him. Please prepare a new magic robe for him and the corresponding identity badge. I'm a bit tired. I'll go rest for a while.\" With that said, he passed between Nianbing and Lidun, heading towards his resting quarters. He didn't spare Nianbing a glance, nor did he say a single word to him, but Nianbing knew that Long Zhi had conceded his bet.\n\nThe shock in Long Zhi's heart had not yet subsided. He had only four words to describe Nianbing's strength: unfathomable. Earlier, when his Wind God Summon, cast at the fastest speed, collided with the inconspicuous orb of light Nianbing unleashed, he immediately realized that the explosive force generated by the collision was beyond his control. In that critical moment, he didn't even hesitate to tear open a Ninth-Tier Defensive Magic Scroll to protect his body. One must know that Ninth-Tier Magic Scrolls were already special magic scrolls that could be found on the market. Although magic scrolls were made from the powder of magic crystals, the magic power they could withstand was ultimately limited. Even with strength, creating magic scrolls above Ninth-Tier required extremely special materials to make the blank scrolls. The craftsmanship for these blank scrolls was known by very few people across the entire continent. The value of a single Ninth-Tier Magic Scroll was already equivalent to hundreds of gold coins.\n\nHowever, when Long Zhi tore open the scroll to defend himself, he was astonished to discover a strange light emitting from Nianbing's body. It was a layer of white light, but within the white light, some gray currents were mixed. The light instantly poured into the center of the explosion, and a strange pattern appeared on his forehead. Immediately after, that pattern shone like the sun. The vast explosive force that should have spread outwards was, after he injected this energy, redirected to surge upwards, and the energy instantly ascended. This was what saved the Magicians' Guild. However, just as that immense explosive force was being drawn upwards, Long Zhi was horrified to discover that the vast explosive force had drained most of his own magic power. At this point, his strength was less than thirty percent of his peak state. Yet, Nianbing looked as if nothing had happened. The magic Nianbing used was something he had never seen before, but he knew very well that Nianbing's unfathomable strength had definitely surpassed the Arch-Magician realm.\n\nIn truth, Nianbing was not feeling well either. His sense of weakness was even stronger than Long Zhi's. When the explosion was about to occur, he immediately sensed that the surrounding seals could not contain this explosive force. He quickly reacted, and through his full understanding of mental power and soul, he sent a call to Long Ling outside. At the same time, he maximized his mental power through his Heaven's Eye Acupoint, gathering this Forbidden Spell-level explosion to surge upwards. Just as his mental power was almost unable to sustain itself, he was surprised to find a strange energy emanating from his chest, merging into his Heaven's Eye Acupoint, which actually completed a task that was originally impossible. After all, he had only recently entered the Arch-Magician realm. Even if his fusion magic was powerful, mental power could not be faked or achieved through shortcuts. Nianbing knew that it was Oscar who had helped him this time. Oscar's strange energy seemed to be very beneficial to his body.\n\nIncluding Long Zhi, no one noticed at the moment of the explosion, that when his mental power was under immense pressure and the vast explosive shockwave, a strange layer of gray scales had appeared on Nianbing's body. After the explosion ended, that layer of gray scales quietly disappeared.\n\nLidun watched the departing Long Zhi in surprise, then looked back at Nianbing. Arch-Magician! In just one year, Nianbing had actually reached the Arch-Magician realm! He had never heard of anyone reaching such a level at Nianbing's age. To him, all of this was too incredible, yet, it was all true.\n\n\"Nianbing, what happened to your hair? Why has it turned white?\" Long Ling no longer cared about the outcome of the competition; Nianbing's change in appearance was what concerned her most. Perhaps, even a Guild Elder like Lidun didn't know what was happening, but she, having also learned the Life Curse, deeply understood where Nianbing's current changes came from. However, Nianbing's appearance had not aged. Even so, her heart rate still doubled.\n\nNianbing took Long Ling's small hand, smiled slightly, and said, \"Don't worry, I'm fine. It's just that I had a breakthrough while cultivating magic, which is why my hair changed to its current appearance. I truly apologize for disturbing everyone's cultivation just now. Nianbing apologizes here. Everyone has also seen my situation. In fact, age cannot prevent us from becoming powerful magicians. To all Guild members, especially young people like me, as long as you are willing to work hard, you can all become powerful magicians. Alright, everyone can go back to your duties. I just returned, so I also need to rest a bit. Teacher Lidun, please trouble you to make me a few new magic robes. They don't need any special symbols, but please make the robes golden. Consider it a commemoration of my previous golden color.\"\n\nLidun was stunned for a moment, then said, \"Golden? Won't that be a bit too ostentatious?\" One must know that magic robe colors are divided into seven according to different magic elements: Light magicians wear white magic robes, Space magicians wear silver magic robes. The other elements are: Dark magicians wear black, Water, Fire, Earth, and Wind magicians wear blue, red, yellow, and azure, respectively. As for special Nature magicians like those from the Langmu Empire, they wear green magic robes. Golden magic robes have never appeared on the continent before.\n\nNianbing smiled slightly, saying, \"Ostentatious? I don't think so. I no longer belong to any single magic element. Are you suggesting I wear a multicolored magic robe instead? Golden it is.\" Having said that, he pulled Long Ling and walked out of the crowd.\n\nThe magicians' gazes towards Nianbing had changed. In the eyes of the older magicians, admiration was tinged with a hint of worry, while the eyes of the younger magicians were filled with fervor. They had all heard of Nianbing's age: twenty. A magician who had reached the Arch-Magician realm at merely twenty years old! In their hearts, Nianbing's image had become extraordinarily grand.\n\n\"Ostentatious? Ostentation is exactly what I want,\" Nianbing thought to himself. In this world, it's a world where the strong survive. As long as your strength is sufficient, what does it matter if you're ostentatious? He had always kept a low profile, but now he wouldn't continue to do so. For Ling'er, what he needed was fame, and this fame would start from within the Ice Moon Magicians' Guild. \"I want everyone on the continent to know the title 'Platinum Robe'.\"\n\nFame is a double-edged sword; it will bring him much, but at the same time, it will also make those petty, despicable people who only know how to eat sour grapes jealous. If they want to be jealous, let them be. Only those who don't know how to work hard will forever eat sour grapes. They can only hide in the shadows, dignified and solemn on the surface, but inwardly full of male thieves and female prostitutes. So what if they play dirty? I'm not afraid. Let whatever comes, come. The most prominent tree in the forest will be destroyed by the wind. Fine! I'll see how strong the wind is that tries to blow me down. Ice Goddess Priestess? Even if you don't come looking for me, it won't be long before I come looking for you.\n\nWith a slight smile, a faint gleam appeared in Nianbing's eyes. Long Ling suddenly felt how firm his large hand was as it held hers. This man was like a mountain, a mountain she could forever rely on. With him by her side, she wouldn't feel fear or dread. The worry in her eyes vanished. Everything Nianbing had done since his return had told her much. What more did she need to worry about? Everything, she would leave to her man. Yes, he was her man, always, and the only one. Even if he failed, what then? She would always have her destiny, but in this life, she would only belong to this one man. Leaning on Nianbing's shoulder, Long Ling pointed in a nearby direction.\n\nNianbing smiled slightly, and taking her with him, walked in that direction.\n\nThis was Nianbing's first time visiting Long Ling's boudoir. Her room was simply decorated, with various plush toys occupying most of the space; their presence was in every corner. The overall color of the room was light purple, just like Long Ling's long purple hair. The elegant and cozy atmosphere greatly eased Nianbing's heart. He deeply felt that no matter what he did for Long Ling, it was worth it.\n\nHe pulled the bashful Long Ling closer. Having her sit on his lap, he embraced her soft, delicate body, inhaling the faint fragrance on her. Nianbing's heart surged with emotion. \"Ling'er, you've suffered these past days.\"\n\nLong Ling gently shook her head, smiling tenderly. She said, \"It was all worth it, wasn't it? I didn't wait in vain. I know everything you just did was for me. Was Ling'er worth it?\"\n\n\"Of course, it was worth it,\" Nianbing said solemnly. \"Ling'er, do you know? The moment I stepped back into Ice Snow City, I swore that from now on, no matter what, I would never let you shed another tear for me. Rest assured, for you, even if I seek revenge in the future, I will definitely keep my life intact.\"\n\nLong Ling's eyes showed a watery gentleness as she leaned into Nianbing's embrace, softly saying, \"Nianbing, I'm so happy right now. Do you know? Since you rejected me back then, Ling'er hasn't had a single happy day. I tried to forget you, but I just couldn't. I don't even know what I like about you, but I just do. Nianbing, I don't care about anything else. Just being by your side is enough. I know you still have many things to do. I won't follow you, because I don't want to be a burden to you. I only hope you'll remember that no matter what you're doing, I will always support you and wait for you to return.\" The tenderness of a gentle woman was enough to soften hard metal. Even with Nianbing's powerful mental strength, at this moment, he could not restrain the emotions in his heart. Somewhat roughly, he kissed those soft lips, deeply, deeply kissing her.\n\nLong Ling cast aside her modesty, awkwardly responding. Hooking her arms around Nianbing's neck, she had only one thought in her heart: at this very moment, this man belonged to her.\n\nA fire seemed to burn in Nianbing's heart. He forgot everything, cast aside all concerns. Before he knew it, his hands had already caressed Ling'er's full breasts, and their breathing gradually grew heavier. Yet, he had no qualms. When he returned to find Long Ling, he had already decided she would be his wife. As for Long Ling, she simply had no desire to resist now. She dared not think of the future; she was more willing to dedicate herself to the man she loved most at this moment.\n\nJust as Nianbing had unfastened Long Ling's clothes, preparing to proceed with the next step, a discordant voice sounded in his mind: \"Hey, I say, Nianbing,\" The sudden voice startled Nianbing. He hastily withdrew his exploring hands, and the desire in his heart instantly subsided, his body becoming somewhat stiff.\n\nNianbing's sudden halt left Long Ling feeling a wave of emptiness, and she subconsciously let out a sigh of relief. Lying on Nianbing's chest, she continued to pant softly, \"Nianbing, you, what's wrong?\"\n\nNianbing gave a wry smile and said, \"It's nothing, Ling'er. Can I just hold you tight?\" As he spoke, he held Long Ling tightly. In his warm embrace, Long Ling's heart filled with contentment. She closed her eyes and, under the hypnosis Nianbing had secretly cast based on dark magic, fell asleep. It was the first time in many days that she had slept so contentedly.\n\nCompared to Long Ling's contentment and peacefulness, Nianbing was currently cursing a certain clueless fellow.\n\n\"Oscar, are you deliberately trying to spite me? Who told you to peek?\" With his good deed ruined, how could Nianbing's mood be good?\n\nOscar chuckled and said, \"I say, brother, you can't blame me for this! Who told us we share a body now? What you see and feel, I naturally feel too. I'm so wronged! I clearly just helped you, and instead of thanking me, you're blaming me. Without my help, could you have so smoothly sent that explosive force soaring into the sky?\"\n\nUpon hearing Oscar's words, the trace of anger in Nianbing's heart dissipated. He asked, puzzled, \"Have you already mastered a way to control your energy? What exactly is that gray energy of yours?\"\n\nOscar said, \"Still haven't figured it out. How could it be that easy? My energy is very strange. As soon as I sense the energy within your body, I feel very comfortable. Earlier, the crisis in your mental power awakened me from my cultivation, and I just helped you out as a bonus. I've found that my energy isn't like your magic power, but rather formed by a combination of energy similar to magic power and mental power. As for its specific effects, I'll only be able to confirm them after more cultivation.\"\n\nNianbing said, somewhat resignedly, \"Alright, brother, you can go back to sleep now. Work hard on cultivating your abilities. I hope you won't make a sound next time this happens.\"\n\nOscar chuckled, saying, \"That's hard to say. Your emotions were very agitated just now! When you're overly excited, I'm very likely to wake up again. After all, we share the same body, don't we?\"\n\nNianbing said resentfully, \"You're doing this on purpose! I will definitely open the Seven Apertures Acupoints soon to reshape a body for you and get you out!\" In truth, he was still very grateful to Oscar for helping him out at a crucial moment. However, who would want someone \"watching\" when they're being intimate with the woman they love?\n\nOscar ceased speaking, seemingly having entered a dormant state again. Nianbing lightly kissed Long Ling's forehead, carefully placed her on the bed, and let her sleep soundly. Pulling up a chair, Nianbing sat down, his mind churning with various thoughts. Today, for Ling'er, he impulsively proposed a bet to Long Zhi. Since it had been made, he couldn't regret it now. But, just as Long Zhi said, how could he influence the entire political landscape of the Ice Moon Empire? Helping the First Prince or the Second Prince was obviously the best choice. They already had a certain degree of influence. But if he really helped them, could they be controlled by him? That seemed absolutely impossible. Kill Yan Yun? That wouldn't be difficult, but killing him would likely implicate the Magicians' Guild, and by extension, Ling'er. That was absolutely undesirable. At that time, Long Zhi also wouldn't acknowledge him. To make Long Zhi truly entrust Ling'er to him, he would have to help him achieve his wish. What should he do?\n\nAs he thought, a figure suddenly appeared in Nianbing's mind—a familiar figure. It was him, it had to be him. Although somewhat helpless, he had to make a choice. At least, he deeply believed that the person he wanted to help was absolutely trustworthy. The person Nianbing thought of was the Seventh Prince Yan Feng, who had no influence whatsoever in the Ice Moon Empire, the \"Chrysanthemum Yan\"* who had once made Nianbing nearly vomit. Although his sexual orientation made Nianbing somewhat uneasy, Nianbing believed that he was a trustworthy friend. If he helped him ascend to the throne of the Ice Moon Empire, it would clearly be the best choice. Then, when he asked him to look after the Magicians' Guild, he would definitely not refuse.\n\nHowever, a problem arose. Although Yan Feng was also one of the princes, his influence was too weak, and he had that special 'hobby'. Outsiders might not know, but how could their imperial family not know? Making him king was simply too difficult. Relying solely on himself was absolutely insufficient. Thinking of this, Nianbing's mind raced, pondering the forces he could utilize. Long Zhi was wrong about one thing: Nianbing was no longer alone. The hidden power he possessed was beyond Long Zhi's imagination. Just the Fire Dragon King Galamandis alone had already reached the level of the Ice Goddess Priestess. Moreover, he had friends, and asking for their help wouldn't be difficult. Galamandis, Hilard, and his own grandfather flashed through his mind one by one. In his continuous contemplation, Nianbing had already roughly set out what needed to be done in the coming period.\n\nThinking of this, he walked out of Long Ling's room and quietly left the Magicians' Guild.\n\nThe most satisfying aspect of Innate Qi for Nianbing was its self-recovery ability. Without needing deliberate cultivation, his consumed magic power and mental power would gradually recover. Especially with the help of the Heaven's Illumination Acupoint, he didn't need to rest; his mental power could quickly recover to its optimal state.\n\nWalking along the main street, Nianbing soon stopped in front of a shop. This was a shop selling various magic items, of moderate size, and inconspicuous on the street.\n\nEntering the shop, Nianbing looked around. At this time, there were no other customers in the store. A service attendant had already come forward, saying, \"Sir, what can I get for you?\"\n\nNianbing calmly said, \"Lion's Roar Yangguang.\"\n\nA strange glint flashed in the service attendant's eyes. He nodded and said, \"What you seek is very valuable. Please follow me to the back hall.\" Saying this, he led Nianbing towards the back of the shop. After passing the counter and entering a small door, the service attendant said nothing more, and tapped rhythmically on a nearby wall a few times. With a clicking sound, a secret door opened, revealing a narrow staircase leading downwards.\n\nThe service attendant nodded to Nianbing. Nianbing didn't hesitate in the slightest, immediately descending the stairs. The door behind him closed naturally, leaving no trace. Putting on a smiling face, the attendant returned to the front.\n\nOrdinary magic gems were embedded along the narrow passage on both sides. These gems provided a faint light in the passage. The further down he went, the denser the magical aura became. After descending approximately twenty meters and turning two corners, Nianbing arrived inside an underground stone chamber.\n\nFrom a corner, a cold voice sounded, \"Lion's Roar Yangguang.\"\n\nNianbing did not look in that direction, calmly saying, \"Blazing Continent.\" Through his Heaven's Eye Acupoint, he clearly sensed that there were at least ten people in this small stone chamber, each not weak in strength, but their auras were hidden extremely well.\n\nA figure emerged from the corner. This person wore black clothes, had short black hair, a medium build, and ordinary features, belonging to the kind of common appearance that would be hard to pick out in a crowd. However, the glint in his eyes was not ordinary, carrying a hint of coldness within its calmness. His eyes flickered with light as he scrutinized Nianbing.\n\nNianbing also watched him without a word.\n\nThe man in black said, \"Please show your token, envoy.\"\n\nA light flashed in Nianbing's left hand. A exquisitely carved Red Jade Lion, shimmering with a faint red glow, appeared.\n\nThe man in black was clearly stunned for a moment. Immediately after, he knelt on one knee and respectfully said, \"Greetings, Cult Master.\"\n\nNianbing was also a bit stunned. \"Cult Master? You're saying I'm the Cult Master?\"\n\nThe man in black affirmed, \"Yes. It recognizes the lion, not the person. Only the Cult Master can possess the Blood Lion. Since you have the token, you are our Cult Master. Your subordinate is Xue Ye, Flag Master of the Ice Snow Banner, under the Ice Moon Hall of the Blood Lion Cult.\"\n\nNianbing took a deep breath and said, \"You may rise.\" Not long after leaving Dutian City, Prince Rong once had a heart-to-heart talk with him. Because Nianbing promised to take over guarding the entire Rong family from Prince Rong in the future, Prince Rong told him a secret known only to the Rong family patriarch. That was the Rong family's underground influence across the entire Yangguang Continent. Only Prince Rong knew about this matter. And this underground power had existed for a thousand years. Prince Rong hadn't told Nianbing how vast this underground power was, but he had clearly informed him that this underground power was called the Blood Lion Cult. Its members' loyalty was absolutely beyond doubt. The Red Jade Lion was the token. As long as a command was issued after confirming identity with this lion, the Blood Lion Cult would exert their utmost effort to complete it.\n***\n**Translator's Notes:**\n*   A zhang (丈) is a traditional Chinese unit of length, roughly equivalent to 3.33 meters or 10.9 feet.\n*   \"Chrysanthemum Yan\" (燕菊花) is a derogatory nickname that in Chinese slang often implies effeminate or homosexual tendencies.",

    "title": "Chapter 136 Blood Lions (Part 1 and Part 2)",
    "content": "However, Rong Prince had not told him that this ruby lion represented the status of the Cult Master.\n\nLooking at Blood kneeling before him, Nian Bing calmly said, \"You may rise.\"\n\nBlood stood up, respectfully saying, \"Cult Master, may I ask about Magic Lion...\" At this point, a hint of sorrow involuntarily appeared in his eyes.\n\nMagic Lion referred to Rong Prince. Rong Prince had told Nian Bing that within the Blood Lion Cult, people from all walks of life existed, and everyone in the Cult only had a codename, not a real name. His codename was Magic Lion.\n\nNian Bing understood Blood's meaning and said, \"Magic Lion is fine. It's just that he passed this Blood Lion Order token to me. I think I understand his intention now. From now on, I am the Cult Master of the Blood Lion Cult.\"\n\nBlood's expression turned serious as he said, \"Please, Cult Master, reveal your codename. I will transmit it with the fastest speed to the brothers in every branch hall and every flag. We await the Cult Master's command at any time.\"\n\nA gleam flashed in Nian Bing's eyes as he said, \"My codename will be White. Magic Lion didn't tell me much about the Cult's affairs. Now, first, introduce me to the situation of the Blood Lion Cult.\"\n\nBlood nodded and said, \"Our Cult was founded one thousand three hundred and sixty-four years ago. Our Cult's system is strict; everything proceeds according to orders. The highest ruler is the Cult Master, who holds the Blood Lion Order token. Successive Cult Masters pass down the Blood Lion Order token before their demise and relay the message to the Cult's highest Elder Hall, the Blood Lion Hall, for confirmation, to prevent the Blood Lion Order token from being stolen. Below the Cult Master, the seven elders of the Blood Lion Hall are revered. The Blood Lion Hall is jointly managed by the seven elders and includes five hundred Blood Guards. All of them are the elite of the Cult's elite, specialized in handling the most difficult special operations. Our Cult members are engaged in various professions across the continent. Besides the Blood Lion Hall, there are five parallel Halls, named after the five great empires: Hua Rong Hall, Lang Mu Hall, Ice Moon Hall, Qi Lu Hall, and Ao Lan Hall. Below the five Halls are Flags, with each Flag responsible for one city, regardless of size. The number of members under each Flag varies according to the city's scale. Taking the Ice Snow Flag under my command as an example, there are a total of two hundred and sixty-seven members, with one hundred and nine combat personnel. Our Cult members have different titles according to their rank. The Cult Master is the sole Blood Lion level. Below the Cult Master, the seven great elders are also known as Golden Lion Elders. Below them are the five Hall Masters, who are of the Silver Lion level. And below that, we Flag Masters are of the Red Lion level. All combat personnel, apart from the Blood Guards of the Blood Lion Hall, are divided into seven levels from highest to lowest: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, and Purple, according to their strength. Among them, a Red Lion Flag Master must at least reach the combat Yellow level ability, unless they have made special contributions to the Cult. And Hall Masters and Elders must all reach Red level ability. Red level ability is equivalent to a Martial Saint or Magic Grandmaster realm. The weakest Purple level is equivalent to a Swordsman's strength. Without the strength of a Swordsman or above, one cannot become a combat personnel. In other words, the strength of combat personnel in our Cult is divided more finely.\"\n\nUpon hearing Blood's introduction, Nian Bing was greatly astonished. He had initially thought that this Blood Lion Cult was just a secret intelligence network of the Rong family, but now it seemed the Blood Lion Cult was far from being merely an intelligence network. The Rong family's hidden strength was no weaker than their overt power. What exactly did his grandfather intend by giving him the position of Blood Lion Cult Master? If the Blood Lion Cult's Red-level masters were Martial Saints, what did that signify? Five Hall Masters plus seven Elders were all Martial Saints. Heavens, a sudden appearance of twelve Martial Saints, coupled with the Blood Lion Cult's power across the entire continent, was simply terrifying. He, who originally had no confidence in supporting Yan Feng's ascent to the throne, suddenly gained significant assurance with the Blood Lion Cult's support.\n\nWatching Nian Bing's constantly changing expression, Blood coughed and asked, \"Cult Master, do you have any other commands?\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment, then raised the Blood Lion Order token in his hand and said, \"Transmit my order: within the shortest possible time, dispatch eighty percent of the Blood Lion Cult's combat personnel above Green level to Ice Moon City, the capital of the Ice Moon Empire. The five great Hall Masters and seven Elders shall also be simultaneously dispatched to Ice Moon City, awaiting orders. This operation's codename is — Changing Skies.\"\n\nUpon hearing Nian Bing demand such a large deployment of personnel at once, Blood was startled. \"Cult Master, do you truly intend to deploy so many people?\"\n\nNian Bing did not answer, continuing, \"At the same time, utilize the Cult's intelligence network to collect all information regarding the various princes of the Ice Moon Empire. All collected data should be sent directly to Ice Moon City. Soon, I will arrive at the Ice Moon Flag in the Ice Moon Empire to issue subsequent orders.\" Blood felt a trace of coldness emanating from Nian Bing and respectfully said, \"Your subordinate obeys.\"\n\nNian Bing gave Blood a deep look and said, \"Convey these deployment orders to Magic Lion. And send two capable individuals to follow me closely, using three claps as a signal, to be at my disposal at any time.\"\n\n\"Yes, Cult Master.\"\n\n\"Alright, proceed with what I've instructed as quickly as possible. I'll be leaving now.\"\n\nAfter Blood personally saw Nian Bing out of the magic item shop, he returned to the secret room and sternly commanded, \"Someone!\"\n\nA dark shadow seemed to float out of the wall, kneeling on one knee before him, respectfully saying, \"Flag Master.\"\n\nBlood said, \"Send two Green-level brothers to follow the Cult Master and await his command at any time. You yourself make a trip to the Blood Lion Hall and report everything that happened here to the elders, including the Cult Master's orders. Let them decide everything, but be sure to first confirm the Cult Master's identity. I find this person a bit strange; I can't sense any aura from him, as if he's an ordinary person. White, White, could there really be such a young Cult Master?\" He did not notice that in the corner of the wall, a faint silver light flickered away silently.\n\nStanding on the street, Nian Bing's face showed a faint smile as he murmured to himself, \"Careful and meticulous. Truly worthy of being a Flag Master. Go ahead and investigate. Since Grandpa gave me the Blood Lion Order token, everything must have already been arranged for me. It seems I really need to meet these leaders of the Cult soon. Such a powerful force—from now on, they will be my eyes.\"\n\nWhen Nian Bing returned to Long Ling's boudoir, Long Ling was still sound asleep. Her sleeping face was as beautiful as ever, and a hint of contentment showed on her gentle, pretty face. Nian Bing pulled the quilt up for her, then left the room to find Long Zhi.\n\n\"Teacher, may I come in?\" Nian Bing gently knocked on Long Zhi's door.\n\nLong Zhi's voice came from inside the room, \"Come in.\"\n\nPushing the door open, Nian Bing entered Long Zhi's room. This was not his first time here, but each time he came, he couldn't help but admire Long Zhi's dedication. The room contained nothing but a meditation cushion. To improve his magic, Long Zhi practically trained diligently every day.\n\nNian Bing walked over to face Long Zhi and sat directly on the floor. \"Teacher, before I came back today, I went to Qingfeng Pavilion. Uncle Xue Ji wants to invite us for dinner tonight.\"\n\nLong Zhi answered irrelevantly, \"What exactly is your domain?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"I call it the Heavenly Eye Domain.\"\n\nLong Zhi sighed softly. \"I didn't expect that my many years of effort wouldn't even compare to you, a newcomer who's only practiced magic for ten years. It seems I'm truly old.\" This defeat today not only made Long Zhi look at Nian Bing with new respect but also somewhat diminished his ambition to expand the Magician Guild.\n\nNian Bing said, \"Teacher, sometimes being too persistent isn't a good thing. Perhaps you might think that the most precious thing to you is the Guild, but you are mistaken. To you, the most precious thing should be Ling'er. If you exchange your most precious possession for the prosperity of the Guild, do you truly think it's worth it? Actually, there's no need for you to be disheartened. Although my magic power has entered the threshold of a Magic Grandmaster, there is still quite a gap between us. The reason I was able to defeat you today was that my seven blades played a crucial role. If I hadn't used them, it wouldn't have been easy to defeat you with just my Innate Domain. At the same realm, control techniques become the key to victory or defeat. You seem to have neglected this aspect.\"\n\nLong Zhi's face showed a hint of a smile. \"I have to admit, you are a genius. I can almost certainly say you will become the next Divine Descendant Master on the continent. While the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess is powerful, she was nowhere near your current achievements at your age. Nian Bing, I am proud of you. However, my thoughts will not change. I will give you three months. If you cannot show me some results within three months, then you know the outcome yourself.\"\n\nNian Bing stood up, and as he walked towards the door, he said, \"Teacher, I am no upright gentleman. Within these three months, I will definitely do my best. However, if I fail, then I will not allow Ling'er to marry that Fifth Prince. Tonight, please join us at Qingfeng Pavilion. It's been a long time since I tasted Master Ming's cooking.\"\n\nLong Zhi was startled, and Nian Bing had already walked out of the room. He clearly felt the strong murderous aura emanating from Nian Bing at that moment. That killing intent was not directed at him, so it was clear it was aimed at...\n\nDinner at Qingfeng Pavilion concluded in a calm and harmonious atmosphere. During the meal, Long Ling was the happiest. Sitting beside Nian Bing, she ate with exceptional relish; the joy that had been absent for so long reappeared within her. Xue Jing seemed very calm, eating quietly on Long Ling's other side, not even glancing at Nian Bing or Galamandis. Long Zhi chatted cheerfully with Xue Ji as if nothing had happened. Ming Yuan and Ming Hui also attended the dinner; Nian Bing's presence greatly excited them, and the three exchanged culinary insights, feeling they had gained quite a bit.\n\n\"Teacher, I'd like to stay at Qingfeng Pavilion for a few days first. In a couple of days, I want to go to Ice Moon City to experience the cuisine there,\" Nian Bing said with a smile to Long Zhi.\n\nBefore Long Zhi could reply, Long Ling became anxious. \"Nian Bing, you've just come back after so long, how can you go back to the Guild?\"\n\nNian Bing squeezed Long Ling's soft little hand under the table. Through the interaction of his spiritual power and soul, his voice directly resounded in Long Ling's heart, \"Aren't you afraid I'll eat you tonight?\"\n\nLong Ling's pretty face instantly turned crimson. \"You...\" Seeing her shy appearance, Nian Bing truly wanted to go back with her and \"eat\" her, but remembering he had many things to do, he reluctantly suppressed the lustful thought.\n\n\"Be good, Ling'er. From now on, I will work hard for our future.\"\n\nLong Ling lowered her head, no longer speaking.\n\nLong Zhi looked at his daughter with some surprise and said, \"Alright then, staying with Old Xue here is indeed more comfortable than at the Guild.\"\n\nLong Ling reluctantly left with Long Zhi. Xue Jing actually volunteered to escort Nian Bing and Galamandis back to their rooms. The three walked through the elegant environment of Qingfeng Pavilion. When they arrived outside the guesthouse where Nian Bing and Galamandis were staying, Xue Jing stopped, and said in a low voice, \"That Long-whoever, you go back first. Nian Bing and I have something to talk about.\"\n\nGalamandis was stunned for a moment, then displeased. \"My name is Long Hu, not Long-whoever.\"\n\nXue Jing retorted impatiently, \"Long Hu, fine. You go back first.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Xue Jing, just say what you want to say directly. Big Brother Long is an outsider.\"\n\nXue Jing bit her lower lip and said, \"Do you truly like Ling'er?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded firmly.\n\nXue Jing took a deep breath, as if she had made a decision. \"Alright then, you must treat Ling'er well. For Ling'er's sake, let's forget about what happened between us before. But if you dare to wrong her, don't blame me for being impolite to you.\"\n\nNian Bing was momentarily stunned, looking at Xue Jing with a questioning gaze. Xue Jing's pretty face flushed at his stare. \"What are you looking at? Haven't you seen a beautiful woman before! You stinky men, how can you compare to the bond between us sisters? I've said what I needed to say. Just remember it.\" After speaking, she immediately turned and ran off.\n\nWatching Xue Jing's retreating figure, Nian Bing finally confirmed that the lingering resentment between them had truly vanished. He shook his head helplessly. \"Women! They truly are fickle creatures.\"\n\nGalamandis feigned anger, \"You're not allowed to call her an animal.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"If she weren't an animal, how could she be with you?\"\n\nGalamandis's face immediately fell upon hearing this. \"I say, brother! What do you think I should do now?\"\n\nNian Bing naturally knew what he was referring to and smiled, \"Don't rush. I can't quite figure out Xue Jing's temper either. We can only take it one step at a time. Since you genuinely like her, you need to value time. How about this: tomorrow, I'll talk to Uncle Xue Ji and suggest that you take Xue Jing as your disciple.\"\n\nGalamandis's eyes nearly popped out, and his voice rose eight octaves. \"What? You want me to take her as my disciple?\"\n\nNian Bing stated as a matter of course, \"If you can't get close to her, how can you win her heart? Only with more contact and more understanding will you have a chance. More importantly, you need to let her understand how powerful your strength is.\"\n\nGalamandis smiled bitterly, \"But that Xue Ji has no good impression of me at all. Will he agree?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"That's up to me. You may not be good at chasing girls, but is your strength not enough? Don't forget, you are the great Fire Dragon King Galamandis! I will only stay here for two more days at most, then I'll make a trip to Ice Moon City. During this time, you should focus on developing your relationship with Xue Jing. Remember, don't act too hastily. First, do your job well and at least gain their father and daughter's trust and goodwill before proceeding to the next step. Whether you succeed or not depends on you. While I'm away, I'll have to trouble you, Big Brother, to look after Ling'er for me. That Fifth Prince not only has intentions towards Xue Jing today, but he also harbors improper intentions towards Ling'er. I'll be away, so I'll have to trouble you.\"\n\nGalamandis laughed heartily. \"You boy, you really have a knack for chasing girls! You just sent away a Phoenix Woman, and now another Ling'er has appeared. I didn't get a chance to ask you at dinner tonight, but this Miss Ling'er looks pretty good too! But do you really intend to have both? Will they agree? Aren't you afraid they'll get jealous?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"I told Phoenix Woman about Ling'er a long time ago, and Ling'er also knows about Phoenix Woman's existence. For me, I can't abandon either of them now.\" As he spoke, the smile on his face turned into a bitter one. He himself didn't know what it would be like when Long Ling and Phoenix Woman met again in the future.\n\nReturning to his room, Nian Bing sat on his bed and began to meditate. While meditating, he pondered the events of the day, organizing his thoughts. The seven solid magic energy spheres within his body, propelled by the Innate Qi, absorbed the magic elements in the air at least three times faster than ordinary magicians. He had just entered the Magic Grandmaster realm and needed to better consolidate his power to strengthen his abilities.\n\nThe next morning, after breakfast, Nian Bing found Xue Ji alone and asked to speak with him. Xue Ji readily agreed and led him directly to his study.\n\n\"Uncle Xue, I came to see you today to talk about Big Brother Long.\"\n\nUpon hearing Nian Bing wanted to talk about Galamandis, Xue Ji immediately frowned. \"Nian Bing, other things are easy to discuss. But I truly find it difficult to accept this Long Hu. Jing'er won't like him either, so there's no need for you to say more.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Although I don't fully understand how Big Brother Long offended you, what I want to discuss with you today is not about matters of affection. After all, when it comes to love, it requires mutual affection and cannot be forced in the slightest. Since Xue Jing doesn't have such feelings for Big Brother Long, how could I make things difficult for you?\"\n\nXue Ji looked at Nian Bing with some surprise and asked, \"Then what do you mean?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"You must have noticed that Big Brother Long's strength is exceptionally great, and he also cultivates fire-attribute battle aura. Actually, he's a very good person. He just did some impolite things because he likes Xue Jing too much. I apologize to you on his behalf first. I'm going to Ice Moon City tomorrow, and it's a bit inconvenient to bring Big Brother Long with me. I'd like to let him stay here and wait for me, but Big Brother Long isn't willing to just eat and drink for free here. I discussed it with him, and if you're willing, you could let Big Brother Long teach Xue Jing some martial arts. Of course, I assure you, he will definitely not pester Xue Jing anymore; he will only teach her martial arts.\"\n\nXue Ji laughed. \"Nian Bing, you boy, you say you won't force it, but aren't you still creating opportunities for them?\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"Uncle Xue, perhaps you have a good impression of that Fifth Prince, but there's something I must tell you: the Fifth Prince has already proposed marriage to Teacher Long Zhi.\"\n\n\"What?\" Xue Ji was startled. \"I thought Ling'er was very close to you?\"\n\nA cold light flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. \"Of course, I won't let Ling'er become a victim of a political marriage. Therefore, I still have many things to do. I'm telling you this just so you know that the Fifth Prince is not someone worthy of Xue Jing entrusting her life to. This time, even if you give Big Brother Long a chance, he truly will only teach Xue Jing some martial arts.\" Here, he paused before continuing, \"In terms of strength, my Big Brother Long is probably one of the few on the entire continent. If Qingfeng Pavilion encounters any trouble, as long as he is here, I believe those troubles will naturally disappear.\"\n\nHearing Nian Bing's veiled hint, coupled with his previous understanding of Galamandis, Xue Ji's heart stirred. He said, \"Alright then, I'll trust you this once, but you must make it clear to that Long Hu boy that he is only to instruct Jing'er in martial arts.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Don't worry, Big Brother Long won't mess around anymore.\"\n\nLeaving Qingfeng Pavilion, Nian Bing walked to an empty corner and clapped his hands three times. Instantly, two grey figures silently appeared beside him, without making a sound.\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"Tell Blood that I will be heading to Ice Moon City tomorrow. The Ice Snow Flag personnel don't need to go. Constantly monitor the Fifth Prince of the Ice Moon Empire who is staying in this city. If he makes any moves detrimental to the Magician Guild, you must protect Miss Long Ling of the Guild.\" He spoke quickly. After finishing, he immediately walked towards the street, heading for the Magician Guild.\n\nOne of the two grey figures drifted away, while the other continued to follow Nian Bing from a distance.\n\nBefore he even reached the entrance of the Magician Guild, Nian Bing saw Long Ling standing outside the Guild looking in his direction. A warmth filled his heart. Compared to Long Ling, Phoenix Woman was more independent; Phoenix Woman had her own thoughts and pursuits. But Long Ling only had him in her heart. That feeling of reliance was something Phoenix Woman didn't possess. Both were women he loved, yet Phoenix Woman and Long Ling gave him completely different feelings.\n\nSmiling faintly, Nian Bing walked quickly towards her. Long Ling unhesitatingly took his large hand. \"You're so late! The sun's almost baking your backside!\" Long Ling's complexion today was noticeably better than yesterday, her pretty face a deeper shade of red.\n\nHer eyes were filled with joy as she looked at Nian Bing.\n\n\"Silly girl, even though Qingfeng Pavilion is close, it still takes some time to walk! Why did you come out to wait for me?\"\n\nLong Ling lowered her head and said, \"I was afraid you would suddenly disappear, so I waited for you here.\"\n\n\"How could that be? I can't bear to part with my Ling'er yet.\" As he spoke, the two walked hand in hand into the Guild. The young magicians on duty looked at them, this perfect couple of talented man and beautiful woman, with eyes full of envy.\n\nAs they walked, Long Ling sighed softly. \"Nian Bing, sometimes I don't even know who you are. You always have so many secrets. Do you know? This aspect of you always gives me a sense of instability. My heart is so conflicted; I'm truly afraid you'll abandon me again.\" As she spoke, her eyes reddened involuntarily.\n\nNian Bing didn't rush to explain. He squeezed Long Ling's small hand and whispered, \"Ling'er, all this time, I've brought you too much trouble. I've come today to tell you everything about myself, including all my experiences. I will tell you without the slightest concealment. There's no need for any secrets between us anymore. Perhaps this way you'll have confidence in me.\"\n\nLong Ling stopped, looked up at Nian Bing, and quickly, she gently shook her head. \"No, you don't have to say it. Nian Bing, I believe you. You should have your own privacy.\"\n\nNian Bing, oblivious to others, pulled Long Ling closer and lightly kissed her forehead. \"Silly girl, privacy is for outsiders. You are my future wife, what privacy is there to have?\"\n\n\"Ah! Annoying! There are still people here!\" Long Ling was so shy she buried her head in her chest, not daring to look at the magicians passing by.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, took Long Ling's hand, cast a wind-attribute magic on himself and her, and floated back into Long Ling's boudoir. Inside the room, he cast a soundproof barrier. Still holding her as he did yesterday, Nian Bing began telling Long Ling his story, starting from his childhood.\n\nThis telling lasted a full half-day. Just as Nian Bing himself had said, he held nothing back, revealing everything about himself, starting from his parents, his childhood, and the origins of his deep hatred for the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, all the way to the recent competition, and his relationship with Phoenix Woman. Except for Galamandis and the Seven Dragon Kings' identities, he recounted all his experiences before coming here.\n\nNian Bing's narration was calm, but it stirred a monstrous wave in Long Ling's heart. Only then did she realize that the man she had always deeply loved had endured so many tribulations. Compared to him, she was already much luckier.\n\n\"Alright, I've told you everything I needed to. You know what happened after I arrived here. Ling'er, please don't tell Teacher about my origins in the Rong family, okay?\"\n\nLong Ling leaned in Nian Bing's embrace, her head bowed, quietly listening to Nian Bing's confessions. Until Nian Bing finished everything, she did not interrupt a single word.\n\n\"Nian Bing, I'm sorry, I didn't know...\"\n\n\"Don't say you're sorry. It should be me who is sorry to you. Ling'er, I carry such deep hatred, and my enemy is so powerful. At that time, I truly didn't dare to accept your feelings! It wasn't until I experienced so much with Phoenix Woman that I understood what it meant to cherish. Can you forgive the me from before?\"\n\nLong Ling looked up at Nian Bing, her beautiful large eyes already veiled with a mist of tears. Suddenly, the expression on her face turned serious. \"I can forgive you. I believe everything you just said is true, but there's one thing you didn't mention. When did you use the Life Curse?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart tightened. He hadn't mentioned anything about the Seven Dragon Kings, but Long Ling clearly remembered his white hair. Now, having heard Nian Bing's story, she finally asked the question that had been in her heart.\n\nNian Bing hesitated for a moment and said, \"I'm sorry, Ling'er. I cannot tell you about this matter. It's true, I used the Life Curse. At that time, I had no choice; to protect my friends, I had to do it. Please don't ask, okay? This matter concerns my friends' secret; I truly cannot say.\"\n\nLong Ling gazed deeply at Nian Bing, then nodded and said, \"Okay, I won't ask. But I want to tell you this: if you die, then I will come find you.\"\n\nNian Bing's entire body trembled, and intense emotions spread through his chest. Once again, he deeply kissed those moving lips. Long Ling responded passionately; they both seemed to want to melt into each other. Nian Bing deftly flipped over, pressing Long Ling beneath him. A spark was gradually developing towards a prairie fire.\n\nJust then, that untimely voice sounded again. The calling resonated in Nian Bing's mind, \"Nian Bing.\"\n\nStopping his movements, Nian Bing angrily shouted in his mind, \"Kaka, I'm going to strangle you!\"\n\n\"Idiot, can't you sense the danger outside?\" Oscar said disdainfully.\n\nHis heart stirred. The Heavenly Eye Acupoint, previously clouded by desire, instantly activated. Sensing everything outside, a cold aura spreading through the air immediately calmed Nian Bing. He quickly jumped off the bed, blocking in front of Long Ling. His Innate Domain instantly burst forth, filling the entire room.",

    "content": "Under the effect of his Innate Domain, Long Ling instantly sobered up. She clearly felt her senses enhance exponentially within the Seven-Colored Domain. Ice elements continuously surged into her body, providing an inexpressibly comfortable sensation. For her, the Innate Domain was something she had only heard of; this was her first time experiencing its mysteries so profoundly.\n\n\"Nian Bing, come out here!\" The icy voice stirred Nian Bing's heart, and he immediately recalled who the visitor was. Turning to Long Ling, he softly said, \"Wait for me in the room, don't go out. I'll handle everything.\"\n\nHe retracted his Innate Domain and pushed open the door. Just as he expected, a woman stood proudly in the center of the courtyard. Her snow-white magic robe, a white veil covering her face, and an exceptionally icy aura immediately told Nian Bing it was Qianhuan Bingyun, his opponent whom he had barely defeated in the New Mage Competition, and also his enemy's lackey. Seeing Qianhuan Bingyun, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel an urge to laugh. That self-proclaimed cold, pure, and untainted beauty had actually fallen victim to his Breast-Grabbing Dragon Hand during the competition. It truly seemed absurd in retrospect.\n\n\"You found me quickly! Miss Bingyun, didn't your master come with you?\" Nian Bing calmly looked at Bingyun. Over two months had passed, and he was no longer the Nian Bing from the competition. Bingyun's Ice Goddess Domain could not pose any threat to him.\n\nBingyun looked at Nian Bing's half-smile, her anger boiling to its peak. Nian Bing's final grab during the competition was a profound humiliation to her. Bingyun was filled with hatred and had constantly sought revenge on Nian Bing. However, before she could find him, Nian Bing had quietly left Dutian City. Bingyun searched everywhere for his trace on her way back but found nothing, so she had no choice but to return to the Ice God Tower. The Ice Goddess Priestess was in seclusion for cultivation, and Bingyun herself had originally intended to seclude for a period. Yet, Nian Bing's hateful image frequently replayed in her mind, preventing her formerly pure heart from finding peace, thus her seclusion came to an end prematurely. Just yesterday, she clearly sensed the immense energy generated by the simultaneous explosion of seven types of magic. Although far away, with her cultivation and application of Innate Domain, she was still able to clearly pinpoint the direction of the energy explosion. So, she traveled day and night, flying swiftly using Blizzard magic, and upon reaching Ice Snow City, she naturally headed straight for the Ice Moon Empire Mage Guild.\n\n\"Do you think a petty person like you is even worthy of my master making a move?\" Layers of frost-like aura continuously emanated from around Bingyun's body.\n\nNian Bing slightly smiled, saying, \"But don't forget, this is the Ice Moon Empire Mage Guild, not your Ice God Tower. On my turf, what chance do you think you have?\"\n\nBingyun snorted dismissively, \"If you're still a man, then let's have a fair duel, to the death.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Whether I'm a man or not, I suppose you'd only know in bed.\"\n\n\"You scoundrel!\" Bingyun exploded like a lit powder keg. Her Ice Goddess Domain instantly erupted, and in the blink of an eye, Nian Bing's body was enveloped by a layer of frost. At the same time, Nian Bing clearly felt that although the Ice Goddess Domain was covering him, Qianhuan Bingyun herself soared into the high sky, evidently afraid of his Eternal Slumber Magic Array. Qianhuan Bingyun, you truly underestimate me, Nian Bing. After sharing life and death with the Seven Dragon Kings, do you really think you're still my opponent?\n\nHis Heavenly Eye Domain erupted simultaneously with the Ice Goddess Domain. The frost instantly disintegrated upon encountering the Seven-Element Domain. The attack power augmented by the Ice Goddess Domain posed no threat to Nian Bing whatsoever. Through the perception of his Heavenly Eye Acupoint, Nian Bing accurately located Qianhuan Bingyun. A glint flashed in his eyes, and a Wind Shadow Puppet gracefully floated out, passing through the Ice Goddess Domain and ascending towards the sky. After his battle with Long Zhi yesterday, Nian Bing discovered that the Wind Shadow Puppet, after absorbing Long Zhi's wind magic power, quickly lost that absorbed energy; it didn't maintain its absorbed power level like the Dark Shadow Puppet. He didn't understand why this was.\n\nThe Sky-Defying Blade, carrying a dazzling rainbow, pierced the air, and augmented by the Heavenly Eye Domain, it instantly passed through the Ice Goddess Domain, rushing towards Bingyun in the sky. The Heavenly Eye Acupoint was the bane of all illusion-type magic. Although Bingyun's body was concealed behind a large expanse of ice and snow, she simply could not escape the tracking of the Heavenly Eye Acupoint.\n\nWhile continuously chanting incantations, Bingyun released a Dual-Color Ice Sealing Orb, attempting to block the Wind Shadow Puppet. However, Nian Bing's seven shadow puppets, formed based on his Innate Qi, possessed power equivalent to Seventh-Tier magic even outside his Heavenly Eye Domain. What's more, it held the Sky-Defying Blade in its hand. A green light pierced the sun, and with a shrill grinding sound, the Dual-Color Ice Sealing Orb was split in two. The green light flashed, heading straight for Bingyun's main body. Bingyun was startled. Her magic staff vibrated rhythmically, and circles of icy blue energy drifted out, obstructing the Wind Shadow Puppet's advance. Her Ice Goddess Domain retracted and released again, only then barely managing to force the Wind Shadow Puppet back to the ground.\n\nSeven-colored light subtly pulsed around Nian Bing's body. Seven shadow puppets surrounded him. Through his Heavenly Eye Domain, he was helping the Wind Shadow Puppet replenish its expended energy.\n\n\"Innate Domain?\" Bingyun looked down at Nian Bing in surprise.\n\nNian Bing slightly smiled, \"What? Are you the only one who can possess an Innate Domain?\" Their battle had already attracted the attention of the mages within the guild. Large numbers of mages were rushing over from all directions. Bingyun glared hatefully at Nian Bing. \"Fine, you just wait. This isn't over between us.\" With that, she rapidly sped away into the distance amidst a sudden intensification of the blizzard.\n\nNian Bing coldly stated, \"Of course, it's not over, Miss Bingyun. I believe we'll meet again soon.\" He did not pursue her. It was not yet the time for him to look for trouble with the Ice God Tower. Qianhuan Bingyun's appearance had sparked a bold idea in his mind. Of course, this idea would require time to realize. The seven shadow puppets, along with their seven magic divine blades, vanished simultaneously.\n\nLong Zhi floated over. \"Nian Bing, who were you fighting?\"\n\nNian Bing slightly smiled. \"Naturally, it was the person you dislike the most. The Ice God Tower has already noticed me, Master. I will leave Ice Snow City tomorrow morning. Don't forget our wager.\"\n\nLong Zhi was startled. \"People from the Ice God Tower?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"She came for me; it was Qianhuan Bingyun, who lost to me in the competition. What puzzles me is why the Ice Goddess Priestess didn't appear, even though she knows I have the Ice Goddess Stone. Has the Ice Goddess Stone become unimportant to them?\"\n\nNian Bing wasn't afraid of the Ice Goddess Priestess appearing. Although his current strength wasn't enough, Fire Dragon King Galamandis was still in Ice Snow City. The Ice Goddess Priestess's strength wouldn't be much stronger than Galamandis's. Even if she truly came, Nian Bing wasn't afraid.\n\nLong Ling walked out of the room. She asked nothing, simply leaning gently by Nian Bing's side.\n\n...\n\nClear Breeze Study.\n\nXue Jing looked at Galamandis, whom Xue Ji had brought, and angrily said, \"Father, you're not mistaken, are you? You want him to teach me martial arts?\"\n\nXue Ji had anticipated his daughter's reaction. He smiled faintly and said, \"What's wrong with that? In this world, the strong are revered. Your current strength has only just entered the Great Swordsman realm. You've seen Mr. Long's abilities. With his guidance, your strength will improve much faster.\"\n\nXue Jing snorted dismissively, \"You want me to learn martial arts from such a despicable person? Impossible! What abilities does he have? He only knows how to do sneaky and dishonest acts.\"\n\nGalamandis remained silent, just quietly looking at Xue Jing, making her feel somewhat uneasy.\n\nXue Ji said, \"Everyone has their strengths. You can rest assured, Mr. Long was introduced by Nian Bing. He is only here to teach you martial arts. If you don't want to learn from him, that's fine, as long as you can defeat him.\" Before bringing Galamandis here, he had carefully considered Nian Bing's words and had to re-evaluate Galamandis.\n\nXue Jing sneered, \"Alright then! If you want to take me as a disciple, shouldn't a master at least offer a welcoming gift? As long as I'm satisfied with the gift, I'll consider learning martial arts from you.\" With that, she extended her slender hand. Although she had a bad temper, it didn't mean she wasn't smart. She didn't know exactly how strong Galamandis was, but she knew very well that she couldn't possibly be his opponent, so she immediately came up with another way to make things difficult for him.\n\nGalamandis smiled wryly, \"This is my first time seeing a disciple like you, extorting me before even formally becoming a disciple. Alright, here, take this.\" A red light flashed in his hand, and an unremarkable red short sword appeared in his palm, which he handed to Xue Jing.\n\nXue Jing looked at Galamandis with some surprise. \"You can use magic too?\" Space-type magic items couldn't be activated without magic power.\n\nGalamandis chuckled, \"Do you know how many people want to be my disciples? Indeed, I am proficient in both martial arts and some magic. You could say I'm a Mage-Warrior.\"\n\nXue Jing took the short sword. As soon as it entered her hand, it instantly felt heavy. If she hadn't reacted quickly, the sword might have slipped from her grasp. Only then did she examine the short sword in her hand. The sword was about a foot and two inches long, with a five-inch hilt. There were no gems inlaid on the guard. The entire short sword, including its sheath, appeared dark red, without any dazzling light. However, strangely, the weight of this short sword was more than ten times that of a similar-sized short sword. It felt heavy in her hand, and without using Battle Qi, she found it very difficult to wield. Although she sensed the sword's extraordinary nature, Xue Jing still put on a dismissive expression and said, \"You think you can fool me with just this broken sword? You're too stingy.\"\n\nGalamandis stared at her with wide eyes. \"I'm stingy? Miss, do you know what kind of sword this is? You're currently a Great Swordsman. With this sword, your strength can be elevated by at least one level. You've seen Nian Bing's Righteous Sun Blade, right? This sword, except for not being able to assist magic, is absolutely no worse than that Righteous Sun Blade in quality. You're using the shortest sword. Why don't you draw it out and take a look?\" The most appealing part of his statement to Xue Jing was undoubtedly the phrase \"elevated by at least one level.\"\n\nAlthough Xue Jing was somewhat skeptical, driven by curiosity, she still drew the sword from its sheath. In an instant, the formerly unremarkable short sword underwent a transformation. Its eight-inch blade suddenly erupted with a ten-foot-long red light. That wasn't light produced by Battle Qi secret release, but light emanating from the sword itself. The red light condensed without dissipating, forming a long rainbow. Xue Jing lightly pushed her wrist, immediately creating a curtain of light in the air. Where the red light swept, a rockery stone silently split into two halves. Within the red light, the eight-inch blade also appeared dark red, with a blood-like light flowing through its center. When the sword was swung, a faint red hum was heard, extremely pleasant to the ear. In just this moment, Xue Jing realized she had fallen in love with this sword.\n\nXue Ji, standing by, gasped. He clearly felt that, as a weapon, this sword's power was even above the Sky-Defying Blade he had given to Nian Bing. The reason he chose the Sky-Defying Blade for Nian Bing was partly to win Nian Bing over, and another reason was that the Sky-Defying Blade's own wind-attribute energy leaned more towards assisting magic, while the Xue family had always cultivated fire-attribute Battle Qi. It couldn't significantly enhance their attack power. But this sword was different. When the blade was drawn, its surging fire-attribute energy carried an exceptionally scorching aura. The rockery stone that Xue Jing had cut into two pieces had now turned black. And that was merely the rainbow light emanating from the sword! Such a divine sword being casually given away, this was truly too precious.\n\nXue Jing was now all smiles. She was different from ordinary girls; ordinary girls naturally liked jewelry and ornaments, but having practiced martial arts since childhood, she especially loved precious swords. Such a divine sword instantly made all her previous dissatisfaction with Galamandis disappear. She excitedly said, \"Good! Long, why didn't you take out such a good thing before?\"\n\nGalamandis smiled wryly, \"I'm wronged! I had long prepared this sword, most suitable for you, to give to you, but where did you give me a chance?\" As one of the Seven Dragon Kings, he was the wealthiest among them. This sword, not to mention in Yangguang Continent, was a rare and potent artifact even on the Continent of Gods.\n\nXue Ji said, \"Mr. Long, this sword is too precious. We cannot accept it. Please take it back, Jing'er, return the sword to Mr. Long.\"\n\n**Dragon King Takes a Disciple (Part 2)**\n\nXue Jing said discontentedly, \"Look, he can give it away so easily, he must be incredibly rich. Anyway, this is a disciple-acceptance gift, there's no reason to return it. Master, Xue Jing salutes you.\" With that, she gave Galamandis a slight nod, considering it a formal acknowledgment of apprenticeship.\n\nGalamandis smiled wryly, \"It's a good thing I only took you as a disciple. Any more, and I'd go bankrupt. Mr. Xue, you don't need to be so polite. Since it has already been given, I will absolutely not take it back. Moreover, Xue Jing's current strength is still... ordinary. With this sword, self-preservation should not be a problem. However, this sword's power is quite great, so you must be careful when using it. The sword's name is Blazing Moon.\"\n\nXue Jing laughed, \"Greater power is better! I love powerful things. If I find you displeasing in the future, I'll just cleave you with this sword. You can't block it now, can you?\" With that, she gestured with the Blazing Moon short sword towards Galamandis. Of course, she wasn't really going to cleave Galamandis, it was just a joke. But who knew Galamandis would smile slightly and say, \"Go ahead and cleave. If you can wound me with this sword, would I still be fit to be your master?\" Since he intended to stay and win Xue Jing's heart, he had to heed Nian Bing's advice and show some of his strength.\n\nXue Jing froze for a moment, then uncertainly said, \"You really want me to cleave?\"\n\nGalamandis smiled slightly, his hands behind his back. \"Please.\"\n\nSeeing Galamandis's confident demeanor, Xue Jing snorted in dissatisfaction. She swung the short sword and cleaved towards Galamandis. Xue Ji had no time to stop her, and the red light swept past Galamandis's side. But Galamandis didn't even move. Looking at the surprised Xue Jing, Galamandis was even more pleased with her. She appeared fierce on the surface, but in reality, she was very kind. \"Don't be polite, go ahead and cleave. You can't hurt me.\"\n\nXue Jing bit her lower lip. \"Alright, you said it.\" She flipped her wrist and sent another sword strike. This time, it wasn't a threat. The long rainbow emanating from the short sword went straight for Galamandis's left shoulder.\n\nGalamandis didn't move, nor did he dodge. He allowed the rainbow light to fall gracefully upon him. A similar red light rose from his body. When the light attached to the short sword came into contact with the rainbow light on him, it simply vanished. Forget injury, not even a trace was left.\n\nXue Jing said in astonishment, \"You... what kind of trick is this?\"\n\nGalamandis helplessly said, \"Miss Xue Jing. I have never used any trick. If your Battle Qi can be cultivated to my level, you will naturally understand the mystery within. Look.\" With that, he pointed to the sky. Xue Jing looked up. She saw an unknown bird flying a hundred zhang away in the sky. Just as she was feeling somewhat bewildered, a red light shot out from Galamandis's hand, piercing through the bird's neck in an instant. The bird's body immediately plummeted. Galamandis beckoned with his hand, and the bird's corpse rapidly fell, landing directly in his hand.\n\n\"Is this also a trick?\" Galamandis casually threw the dead bird onto the ground. \"If all of these are tricks, then call someone who can perform them to try. Battle Qi, itself, is a profound study. When cultivated to its extreme, it is almost omnipotent. On the surface, Battle Qi and magic are two completely different energies. However, when they truly reach their peak, there is not much difference between them. Although you have cultivated since childhood, you have too many impurities in your body. Your talent is decent, but your postnatal cultivation method is not very good, failing to fully develop your potential. Miss Xue Jing, please do not doubt my sincerity. I genuinely want to teach you some self-defense knowledge. Indeed, I like you very much. Although I know you don't like me, I absolutely do not wish for the person I like to suffer any harm. If I am willing, I will do my utmost to enhance your strength. Please consider it carefully. If you truly find me annoying, I will not force you to cultivate with me.\" After speaking, he greeted Xue Ji and turned to leave.\n\nLooking at Galamandis's departing tall figure, and then at the short sword in her hand, which emitted a ten-foot-long light, a strange feeling suddenly arose in Xue Jing's heart. Was he teaching her martial arts just so she could protect herself, with no other motive? \"Father, can you do what he just did?\" she asked Xue Ji, who was beside her.\n\nXue Ji was equally shocked by Galamandis's immense power. He shook his head and said, \"Without relying on any weapon, simply using Battle Qi to injure a target a hundred zhang away, not only me, but even your eldest uncle cannot do that. This Long Huo's strength is too powerful. No wonder you said last time that he could defeat a Martial Saint. I think his strength has truly surpassed the Martial Saint realm.\"\n\nXue Jing's beautiful eyes widened. \"You mean, you mean he has reached the legendary Divine Master realm? But he doesn't look very old!\"\n\nXue Ji smiled wryly. \"I don't know that, but just now when he killed the bird, an invisible majesty emanated from him, making it hard for me to breathe. Jing'er, it seems Nian Bing was right. As long as he is in our Clear Breeze Study, no matter what trouble comes, it won't be trouble at all. A Divine Master, could he really be a Divine Master?\"\n\nNian Bing only returned to Clear Breeze Study in the evening. As soon as he entered the door, a waiter led him directly into a large private room. Inside the room, Xue Ji, Xue Jing, and Galamandis were already waiting for him.\n\nUpon seeing Nian Bing, Xue Ji laughed heartily, \"Nian Bing! I have good news for you. Today, Jing'er officially took Mr. Long as her master. Tonight's dinner can be considered the master-acceptance banquet.\"\n\nNian Bing had already anticipated such a result. What level of strength was Galamandis? Xue Jing and Xue Ji were, after all, just ordinary humans. It wasn't difficult to impress them. \"Then I'll congratulate you both. Xue Jing! Since you've taken my elder brother as your master, should you call me 'Martial Uncle' from now on?\"\n\n\"Martial Uncle, my foot! We'll stick to our own ranks. Besides, my master has already agreed that I don't need to call him 'Master' from now on; I can just call him by his name, right, Master?\"\n\nGalamandis hastily nodded, \"That's right, calling me Master is too formal. Just call me by my name.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"Xue Jing, from now on, you must cultivate well with my elder brother. I owe my current achievements largely to Elder Brother's help back then. In fact, you could say Elder Brother is half my master. It's a pity I didn't study Battle Qi, otherwise, this position of the first disciple wouldn't have been yours.\" Recalling how Galamandis had helped him improve his strength, his gaze towards Galamandis couldn't help but become a little strange.\n\nGalamandis naturally understood what Nian Bing was thinking. He chuckled, \"Xue Jing is a girl, so naturally, I won't teach her in the same way I taught you. I have other methods.\"\n\nNian Bing irritably said, \"That's truly unfair!\"\n\nXue Jing curiously asked, \"How is it unfair? Long Huo, what method did you use to teach Nian Bing back then? Don't worry, whatever he could endure, I can endure too.\"\n\nNian Bing maliciously said, \"Alright then! Elder Brother Long, you must be impartial.\"\n\nGalamandis irritably glared at him. \"Impartial, my foot! Eat, eat!\" Once Xue Jing's curiosity was piqued, it wasn't so easy to suppress. She immediately pestered Galamandis, insisting that he tell her how he had taught Nian Bing back then. Galamandis, pestered beyond endurance, had no choice but to recount the process of how he tutored Nian Bing, which made Xue Jing shiver slightly.\n\n\"I never realized you were so bad. You're not planning to teach me that way too, are you?\" Xue Jing asked tentatively. Now she had acknowledged Galamandis's power. And having taken him as her master, it was justified. Her previous reservations naturally vanished. A master who was possibly a Divine Master, no one could stop him from doing anything.\n\nGalamandis smiled, \"Didn't I just say that my method of teaching you will be different? He is a mage, so he needed to strengthen his body. You, on the other hand, are a warrior, and your physical condition is already good; you only need to remove impurities. As for removing impurities, while using the method for Nian Bing is also possible, I'm afraid you might not be able to bear it, so I'll choose another method.\"\n\nNian Bing glared at Galamandis, seemingly accusing him of prioritizing women over friends. Galamandis pretended not to notice, smiling as he looked at Xue Jing beside him.\n\nXue Ji said, \"Nian Bing, it's been a long time since I've eaten anything you made. After you return from Ice Moon City this time, you must showcase your skills and let me feast.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"That's a given. Though I haven't cooked for a while, I might be a bit out of practice now.\"\n\nJust then, a waiter walked in from outside, leaned into Xue Ji's ear, and whispered, \"The Fifth Prince has arrived and specifically asked to see the young lady. Master, what do you think?\" Though his voice was low, how could it escape Nian Bing and Galamandis's ears? Both felt anger welling up inside them and exchanged a glance. Galamandis stood up. \"I'll go.\" Though his expression was calm, Nian Bing could see the anger in his heart. Ever since Nian Bing told him yesterday that Yan Yun was interested in both Long Ling and Xue Jing, Galamandis had been extremely displeased with him.\n\nWatching Galamandis slowly walk out, Nian Bing did not stop him. Xue Ji gave him an inquiring look. Nian Bing smiled, \"Just pretend you know nothing. Let Elder Brother Long handle everything; he knows what he's doing.\" Although he said this, he had already activated his Heavenly Eye Acupoint's ability, following Galamandis to observe the situation outside.\n\nYan Yun arrived with two people. One was the blue-robed elder Nian Bing had seen before, and the other was a grey-robed elder. Evidently, Yan Yun had strengthened his guard because of the previous incident.\n\nGalamandis arrived in the main hall and walked directly to Yan Yun's table, where he sat down. The two elders behind Yan Yun were about to stop him, but Yan Yun waved them off. \"So, it's Elder Brother Long. Where is Miss Xue Jing?\"\n\nGalamandis calmly replied, \"She's busy and cannot come out. What do you need her for?\"\n\nYan Yun frowned slightly. Having suffered a major loss at Nian Bing's hands, his mood was extremely poor. However, Long Zhi had already called on him to apologize and promised him the marriage to Long Ling and full support for his ascension to the throne. At the same time, Long Zhi also stipulated that he could officially marry Long Ling only after he became the King of the Ice Moon Empire. Yan Yun didn't care much about these things; for him, he could have as many women as he wanted. Although Long Ling and Xue Jing were both stunning beauties, he valued the Mage Guild and Xue Jing's backing more. Since Long Zhi had already agreed to support him, he didn't make things too difficult. However, he had a very deep impression of Nian Bing. In the past, he would have already sought revenge. But now, it was more important to gain the support of various forces, so he temporarily put his resentment aside.\n\n\"Elder Brother Long, I have some private matters to discuss with Miss Xue Jing. By the way, Elder Brother, haven't you eaten yet today? What would you like to eat? My treat.\"\n\n\"No need for your treat. I came out to tell you that from now on, you are not to come looking for Xue Jing again. She has already taken me as her master and will dedicate herself completely to cultivation.\"\n\nYan Yun looked at Galamandis in surprise, his eyes flashing. \"Oh? So that's how it is. Then I must congratulate Elder Brother Long and Miss Xue Jing. However, I truly have important matters to discuss with Miss Xue Jing. Could you please ask her to come out?\"\n\nGalamandis extended a hand, moving extremely slowly, to grab Yan Yun. The two elders behind Yan Yun simultaneously stepped out, each extending a hand to block his. Galamandis snorted disdainfully, and a golden light burst from his hand. With a muffled thud, he sent the two elders staggering back, while his hand gripped Yan Yun's neck.\n\nDread emerged once again in Yan Yun's heart. He clearly saw Galamandis's hand slowly reaching out, but for some reason, he simply couldn't dodge, allowing himself to be caught.\n\n\"I don't like repeating myself. I don't welcome you here, and neither does Xue Jing. Leave immediately, otherwise, don't blame me for being impolite. Don't mention yourself; even your father, I could kill him without much difficulty. If you're not afraid of death, feel free to come again.\" Golden light flashed again, and Yan Yun and the two others were sent out through the Clear Breeze Study's main door.\n\nThe two elders who came with Yan Yun simultaneously exclaimed in low voices, \"Divine Battle Qi!\"\n\nYan Yun looked at them in doubt. \"Are you sure that was Divine Battle Qi?\" Divine Master—this term was supreme in the hearts of all warriors. If Galamandis truly was a Divine Master, then everything he said was not merely a threat.\n\nThe two elders both nodded. The blue-robed elder said, \"That's right, it must be Divine Battle Qi. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been utterly helpless. The gap between Saint Battle Qi and Divine Battle Qi is insurmountable. Your Highness, never provoke this person again. Otherwise, unless the Ice Goddess Priestess herself comes, no one can deal with him.\"\n\nYan Yun snorted hatefully. He hadn't expected his actions to be so unlucky. First, there was Nian Bing with his peculiar magic, and now a legendary Divine Master had appeared, completely disrupting his original plans. However, in this world, strength represented everything. Not to mention that he couldn't possibly forcefully act against Clear Breeze Study, even if he could, how many people would it take to contend with a Divine Master? It seemed that gaining the Xue family's support was impossible. He was someone who could pick things up and let them go. Confirming that the matter was unachievable, he immediately turned and left with his two guards.",

    "content": "Galamandis returned to the dining table in the private room, looking at a somewhat worried Xue Ji. \"It's handled. He won't bother Xue Jing again. Let's continue eating.\"\n\nNie Bing gave Galamandis a thumbs up. That kid Yan Yun dared to snatch a woman from the Fire Dragon King; he was truly tired of living. Fortunately, Galamandis couldn't casually kill people, otherwise, he would probably already be a corpse. Strength is the foundation of discourse. This is an eternal truth, no matter when or where.\n\nEarly the next morning, Nie Bing bid farewell to everyone and quietly left Ice Snow City. With Galamandis there, he could rest completely assured about everything on this side. Now, he had to strive for his future with Long Ling. Accompanying him were two green-rank warriors from the Blood Lion Sect, who still followed him from a distance, awaiting his command at any time.\n\nTraveling alone, Nie Bing was not in a hurry. He didn't fly, walking and stopping, fully immersing himself in magic cultivation. The reason he wasn't rushed was that he knew the Blood Lion Sect needed time to deploy personnel. Transferring masters from various empires to Ice Moon City was not something that could be done in a day or two. He would arrive at Ice Moon City first, precisely to find Yan Feng and communicate with him.\n\nThe weather in the Ice Moon Empire was noticeably colder than in other countries; the further north he went, the stronger this feeling became. Nie Bing did not return to the Peach Blossom Forest when he passed by, as he was afraid of remembering everything that had happened between him and Zha Ji. For this teacher who had taught him culinary skills, he felt only gratitude. He had already decided to return to the Peach Blossom Forest to pay respects to Zha Ji after winning the God of Cookery Competition.\n\nThe main road was wide, and the forests on both sides were mostly coniferous. The gradually chilling air did not affect Nie Bing. As he walked, he cut off his external breathing. His walking pace consistently maintained a peculiar rhythm. He found that combining Innate Qi with his elemental magic power, walking in such a way was also a method of cultivation. Although the speed of magic power condensation could not compare to cross-legged meditation, it was not far off. Currently, what Nie Bing most yearned for was the improvement of his magic power. As he walked, he waited for someone to arrive.\n\nTwo days later, Nie Bing, who was slowly advancing, suddenly stopped. In two days, he had only covered a mere hundred li, and there was still a considerable distance to Ice Moon City.\n\n\"Miss Bingyun, your patience is truly admirable,\" Nie Bing said calmly. \"But what's the point of constantly following me like this? Are you waiting for reinforcements from your Ice God Pagoda?\"\n\nA white figure gracefully descended, and the surrounding air grew even colder. It was indeed Qianhuan Bingyun. Just as Nie Bing had expected, after Qianhuan Bingyun was forced away by Nie Bing that day, she was truly unwilling to give up just like that. Nie Bing's insult could only be washed away with blood. Therefore, when Nie Bing left Ice Snow City, she also followed in secret.\n\n\"Nie Bing, if you dare, come back to the Ice God Pagoda with me. Don't you want to know your parents' whereabouts?\" After several days of contemplation, Bingyun had regained her usual composure.\n\nNie Bing looked at Bingyun, veiled by thin gauze, and subconsciously recalled the stunningly beautiful face hidden behind it. He smiled slightly and said, \"I will certainly go to the Ice God Pagoda, but not now. If Miss Bingyun is interested, you are welcome to travel with me. I'm going to Ice Moon City now, and after handling matters there, I will naturally visit the Ice God Pagoda.\"\n\nBingyun was startled for a moment. She hadn't expected Nie Bing to make such a request. She let out a cold laugh and said, \"Aren't you afraid I'll ambush you at any time?\"\n\nNie Bing smiled. \"Afraid, I'm afraid for my life. However, having such a beautiful Miss Bingyun by my side would indeed be an exciting journey. You and I both know that you are no longer my opponent now. Since you want to keep an eye on me, then let's travel together. Don't worry, I won't attack you before we reach Ice Moon City. I imagine your Ice God Pagoda's influence in Ice Moon City must be quite strong. At that time, you can bring masters to apprehend me; I'll be waiting at any time. So, Miss Bingyun, are you interested in traveling with me?\"\n\nBingyun stared coldly at Nie Bing. She couldn't figure out what Nie Bing was thinking, but she was naturally arrogant; how could she show fear when her opponent had made a request? \"Fine, I'll go with you to Ice Moon City.\"\n\nNie Bing cheerfully said, \"Good! Since Miss Bingyun is so straightforward, I'll also promise you: as soon as the matters in Ice Moon City are handled, I'll go with you to the Ice God Pagoda to gain some experience.\" He looked up at the sky and smiled. \"It's getting late. Let's rest for a while. Miss Bingyun, you've been nervously following me these past few days, which probably isn't very beneficial for your magic cultivation, right?\" Saying this, he didn't even ask for Bingyun's opinion, walking directly to a large tree by the roadside and sitting down. He pulled back his golden cloak, revealing a head of white hair. Before leaving Ice Snow City, Li Tao had already given Nie Bing ten golden magic robes that he had rushed to make. He no longer wore coarse cloth clothes. Although these golden magic robes didn't help with casting magic, wearing them on the road was extraordinarily flashy.\n\nBingyun walked to about three zhang away from Nie Bing and also sat down. Before sitting, she had already condensed a block of solid ice on the ground with magic. Her gaze fell upon Nie Bing's white long hair, and a hint of curiosity appeared in her eyes. Although she had grown up in the Ice God Pagoda since childhood, cultivating a cold and indifferent nature, she was still a girl under twenty after all, so how could she not have a sense of curiosity?\n\nNie Bing seemed not to notice Bingyun's gaze, rubbing his stomach. \"Hmm, I'm quite hungry. Let's get something to eat first.\" As he spoke, he turned and walked into the forest. Bingyun also stood up and followed him into the forest not far behind. As they walked forward, they almost simultaneously saw a thick plume of smoke rising in the forest, and a faint smoky smell wafted towards them. There was also a distinct gamey smell. Nie Bing's heart stirred, and a smile appeared on his face as he strode towards the direction of the thick smoke. From a distance, Nie Bing already saw a person sitting there, grumbling.\n\n\"Annoying, truly annoying! Why is what I grill so unpalatable? If only Big Brother Nie Bing were here, his grilled meat tastes much better than mine. Nana, look at what you summoned with your pee! The meat is incredibly awful, so tough, how can I eat this!\" A fiery-red fox sat to the side, looking at its owner with innocent eyes.\n\nSeeing them, Nie Bing couldn't help but reveal a knowing smile and quickened his pace. The fox reacted quickly. It immediately looked warily towards Nie Bing, retreating a few steps to hide beside its owner, only revealing its fox head. Looking at its wily appearance, Nie Bing burst out laughing. \"By Miss Maomao's summons, Nie Bing has arrived!\" With Wind Magic: Gat, he flashed and appeared beside the fox's owner. The person grilling meat alone was clearly Xilade's daughter, Maomao. Maomao looked up, gazing at Nie Bing with an expression of disbelief. She stood up, then tiptoed and pinched Nie Bing's face. \"Wow, I'm not dreaming, am I? When did my summoning magic advance to this level, that I can actually summon Big Brother Nie Bing?\"\n\nNie Bing lovingly rubbed Maomao's head. \"That's right! Big Brother Nie Bing knew you wanted grilled meat, so he was summoned here to serve our lovely Miss Maomao.\"\n\nBingyun had also walked over by this time. Seeing the pretty and adorable Maomao, she couldn't help but show a hint of surprise. The light in her eyes also softened considerably.\n\nMaomao curiously looked at Bingyun. \"Big Brother Nie Bing, who is this big sister?\"\n\nNie Bing smiled slightly. \"She's my friend. We were resting by the roadside and happened to see smoke rising from your direction, and I smelled your fox, so I guessed it was you.\"\n\nThe fox Nana seemed to have grown quite a bit compared to before, especially its fiery-red long fur, which had not only grown longer but also faintly radiated a trace of light gold.\n\nMaomao pulled Nie Bing's large hand and said excitedly, \"Great! Big Brother Nie Bing, Maomao hasn't eaten anything good these past few days, so you absolutely must grill some meat for me!\"\n\nNie Bing smiled slightly. \"You didn't secretly sneak out to play again, did you? How's Uncle Xilade?\"\n\nMaomao stuck out her cute little tongue and said, \"Dad's fine! But he seems to have gone out to look for Uncle Kalodilisi; it seems something happened on Uncle Kalodilisi's side. So I just slipped out to play for a few days; I'll go back myself in a few days. Big Brother Nie Bing, you mustn't tell on me, okay?\"\n\nNie Bing looked at her, both amused and exasperated. \"You little girl! I knew you snuck out again. Doing this, how worried Uncle Xilade must be!\"\n\nMaomao pouted. \"Dad's always forcing me to cultivate magic at home, I'm so pitiful! I'm cooped up every day, so when I finally get a chance, of course I have to run out and play! Big Brother Nie Bing, I'm so hungry. Can you make me something delicious first? Then Maomao will follow you, and when we find a big city, I'll rent a carriage to go home. I can't find my way now.\"\n\nNie Bing truly had no way to deal with her. He said helplessly, \"Alright, alright, let me see what you've caught.\" As he spoke, he looked at the meat Maomao had thrown on the ground. It was no longer ordinary meat, but a blackened lump. The fire beside it had already extinguished, and there was a scattering of white fur on the ground. It seemed Maomao had truly exerted a lot of effort to eat this thing.\n\n\"You greedy little cat, your cooking skills are too terrible! Judging by this fur, what you caught should be a Snow Chicken, unique to the Ice Moon Empire. Snow Chicken meat is tender and succulent, and tastes much better than ordinary chicken. It's also an excellent choice for grilling, so how did you manage to grill it into this state?\"\n\nMaomao giggled and said, \"I was afraid it wouldn't be cooked through and would give me a stomach ache, so I grilled it for a bit longer. Who knew it would turn out like this! Big Brother Nie Bing, does that mean this Snow Chicken should taste really good?\"\n\nNie Bing nodded and said, \"Is your fox's pee still potent? If it can still be useful, we'll wait a bit, then catch another Snow Chicken and I'll make it for you to eat.\"\n\nMaomao clapped her hands excitedly. \"Great! Great! Nana has already evolved to the second stage; its pee can last for a long time! But this Ice Moon Empire is really barren; there are so few wild beasts, even in such a dense forest, I only caught one Snow Chicken in half a day. Big Brother Nie Bing, let's wait a little longer then. I most want to eat your grilled meat! The last deer you grilled was so delicious, but unfortunately, Little Stutterer messed things up, and I didn't even get to eat any. This time, I'm going to have a good meal!\"\n\nLooking at Maomao's eager eyes, Nie Bing said, \"It's not even winter yet. Logically, there should be many animals in such a dense forest, so how could it be barren?\" As he spoke, he slowly closed his eyes, cutting off his external breathing. With the aid of his Celestial Eye Acupoint, he used his Innate Qi to sense the surrounding energy. Innate Qi was extremely sensitive to any energy. Since acquiring Innate Qi, Nie Bing no longer had to worry about his body being unable to withstand the impact of magic power. With the assistance of Innate Qi, his magic power was subtly transforming, and his ability to absorb magic elements from the air on its own was especially beneficial to him. The one who most loved Nie Bing's Innate Qi was Oscar. Oscar had only recently been born, and although he evolved with the combined power of the Seven Dragon Kings, the nourishment from Innate Qi was still very strong for him. Under the nourishment of Nie Bing's Innate Qi, his cultivation speed was very fast, and his gray aura became more and more solidified.\n\nInnate Qi connected him to heaven and earth, allowing him to fully sense the natural Innate Qi. Suddenly, Nie Bing's heart jolted because he was surprised to discover that the Innate Qi in this land was far weaker than he had imagined. With so many plants here, the Innate Qi should have been abundant, but observing it now, the Innate Qi was not strong. Although it didn't affect plant growth, it seemed very strange. Just as Nie Bing was pondering what was happening, an extremely strong current of energy suddenly approached them from underground. His heart jolted again, and Nie Bing remembered how Nana the fox had once summoned a Golden-backed Earth Dragon King with its miraculous urine. His heart tightened, and daring not show the slightest slack, he embraced Maomao beside him and shouted, \"Careful, let's go!\" Under the effect of wind magic, he shot up into the sky, rising high in the blink of an eye. Nana the fox reacted very quickly; the moment Nie Bing embraced Maomao, it had already jumped onto Maomao's shoulder.\n\nAs soon as Qianhuan Bingyun heard Nie Bing's shout, she immediately tore open one of the blizzard scrolls she carried, ascending to a height of a hundred zhang almost simultaneously with Nie Bing. Only then did she look down at the ground with Nie Bing.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Bingyun looked suspiciously at the still calm ground; she hadn't sensed any changes.\n\nNie Bing gazed at the ground and said in a deep voice, \"I don't know what's underground, but this thing can absorb Innate Qi. The scarcity of animals in this forest is probably related to it.\"\n\nThe moment his words fell, with a colossal bang, a tall snow pine was blown sky-high, and a colossal head emerged from beneath the ground, shaking its head and swaying its body as it let out a deafening roar.\n\nThe colossal head appeared round, with a diameter of half a zhang. It resembled the head of a giant rat, covered in grey-black short fur that was exceptionally clear against the forest backdrop. Sabre-like teeth protruded from its mouth, each tooth up to three chi long. A layer of black aura continuously spread outwards, causing trees to wither one after another wherever it passed. A pair of dark red eyes stared at Nie Bing and the two others in the air.\n\nMaomao exclaimed, \"Oh my! It's a Dark Demon Rat! By its appearance, it must have evolved to level five! It's so huge, how terrifying!?\"\n\nNie Bing was startled for a moment. How could he be as familiar with these peculiar demonic beasts as Maomao, who had been cultivating summoning magic since childhood? He couldn't help but ask, \"What is this Dark Demon Rat? Why is it so huge? Your fox is truly amazing; it's leveled up, and the monster it attracted seems to have leveled up too.\" Nie Bing secretly decided that next time he looked for food in the wild, he would definitely not use Nana the fox to attract it.\n\nAt this moment, with the continuous tremors of the ground, the Dark Demon Rat below was continuously emerging from beneath the surface. Each time its colossal body swayed, it kicked up a cloud of soil, and the black aura around it grew stronger. Its massive body was like a small mountain, not at all smaller than the Dragon Kings who had revealed their true forms.\n\nMaomao said, \"Dark Demon Rats are a very rare type of dark-element demonic beast. They usually live underground, preying on small animals and absorbing spiritual energy from heaven and earth to enhance their abilities. The greatest characteristic of the Dark Demon Rat is its evolutionary nature. Generally speaking, ordinary demonic beasts only grow and then their form becomes fixed once they are grown. But evolvable demonic beasts like the Dark Demon Rat can continuously grow. As long as they absorb enough energy, they can evolve again and again. Some of my little pet-pets are all of this type. Oh, right, my big rat, Tian Tian, is also a Dark Demon Rat! It's just that it's only at the second-tier now, far less powerful than the one below. Back then, Dad spent a lot of effort catching Tian Tian for me; it seems he caught it in the Ice Moon Empire. It wouldn't be the child of this big rat below, would it? Dark Demon Rats can only reproduce once in their lifetime, which is quite pitiful. Big Brother Nie Bing, let's go. Let's not hurt it, okay?\"\n\nNie Bing smiled as he looked at Maomao. \"What? You don't want grilled meat anymore? But I have a question. Since this Dark Demon Rat is a dark-attributed demonic beast, why have I never sensed any dark aura from your rat? It seems to only have the ability to ram, relying solely on its body's hardness.\" Nie Bing's interest in the formidable demonic beast below greatly increased. He mused to himself that after opening his Celestial Eye Acupoint, his spiritual power was absolutely no worse than Bai Ren's. If he could learn Bai Ren's summoning magic and have a few powerful demonic beasts by his side, how wonderful that would be!\n\nMaomao naturally didn't know what Nie Bing was thinking. She explained, \"The dark attribute will gradually manifest only after the Dark Demon Rat evolves to the third level, so Tian Tian isn't powerful enough yet! Big Brother, I want to eat grilled meat, but I don't want to eat demonic beasts. This Dark Demon Rat is clearly above level five. Even if we could defeat it, its meat wouldn't be good to eat. Big Brother Nie Bing, a Dark Demon Rat of this level is even more formidable than my Golden-backed Earth Dragon King that isn't fully formed yet. Ah! Look out, it's attacking us!\"\n\nNie Bing's heart stirred. Without even needing to see with his eyes, he clearly felt the current of energy rising from below. His body shifted sideways like lightning, and his Celestial Eye Domain instantly activated. The dark aura weakened on its own, simultaneously transforming into a light aura. Seven Shadow Puppets, each holding a Divine Blade, scattered in the air, awaiting Nie Bing's command to attack at any moment. The Dark Demon Rat's attack method was simple: it opened its mouth wide and spewed a stream of black aura, sweeping towards the three people in the air. With its enormous body and no wings, it clearly couldn't fly. Malicious glints continuously flashed in its dark red giant eyes.\n\nJust as Nie Bing was pondering whether to listen to Maomao and leave immediately or slay the Dark Demon Rat, a sudden anomaly occurred. The Shadow Puppet floating in the air, without receiving Nie Bing's command, acted. A black light flashed and arrived, plunging directly into the dark aura spewed by the Dark Demon Rat. The Demon-Devouring Blade shone brightly, and streams of enormous dark energy coiled around the energy spewed by the Dark Demon Rat, rapidly devouring it. The energy spewed by the Dark Demon Rat instantly grew stronger as it was devoured. The black gem on the hilt of the Demon-Devouring Blade shone brightly, and the entire Shadow Puppet seemed to become corporeal, slowly pressing down towards the ground. Fear showed in the Dark Demon Rat's colossal red eyes, and it retreated step by step. However, it couldn't stop spewing its energy, only allowing the Shadow Puppet to continuously devour it. The Shadow Puppet's eye area lit up, and blood-red eyes radiated a cold light. It raised the Demon-Devouring Blade high, pointing its hilt towards the Dark Demon Rat. A black net of light drifted down. The net continuously expanded in the air, actually enveloping the Dark Demon Rat's body. The Dark Demon Rat struggled violently in panic, but no matter how it struggled, it could not escape the giant dark net.\n\nNie Bing was startled. He hurriedly tried to control his Shadow Puppet with his spiritual power, but he found that the Shadow Puppet was no longer under his control at that moment; all its actions were autonomous. Cold sweat broke out on his back. A peculiar thought suddenly arose in Nie Bing's mind: could it be that this Shadow Puppet of his possessed intelligence? Impossible! It was clearly formed by his own energy.\n\nMaomao cried out loudly, \"Big Brother, what did you do?! Oh, that poor big rat! Did you kill it?\" Maomao looked nervously at the black figure in the air.\n\nNie Bing smiled bitterly. \"I don't know either. These Shadow Puppets are all formed from my energy. Logically, they should be completely under my control, but at that moment just now, I lost control of it, and all its actions were performed autonomously. However, the Dark Demon Rat should not be dead; it seems to be sealed within my Demon-Devouring Blade, much like your summoning magic.\" Ever since obtaining the Demon-Devouring Blade, Nie Bing had meticulously studied it, but he had never found any real results. Now, with the Shadow Puppet, formed with the Demon-Devouring Blade as its core, suddenly undergoing this transformation, he couldn't help but feel a little lost.\n\nThe three of them floated back down to the ground. Nie Bing recalled the other six Shadow Puppets, leaving only the Shadow Puppet that was almost corporeal due to its abundant energy. Feeling the powerful aura it released, Nie Bing felt a little uneasy. Now that it was no longer under his control, if he let it continue to absorb the energy of other dark creatures, would it completely break free from his control? No, it shouldn't! The Demon-Devouring Blade had recognized him and had coagulated with his blood; he and the blade had formed a soul connection. It was impossible for it to betray him. But how could he explain everything that had just happened? Nie Bing couldn't understand. Qianhuan Bingyun, standing nearby, looked at him with a changed expression. Nie Bing's mysterious energy couldn't help but discourage her. For a long time, she had considered herself one of the best among the younger generation of mages. She had been deeply resentful when she lost to Nie Bing in the arena, but the fact before her now was that Nie Bing was much stronger than her, especially that peculiar Innate Domain, which seemed to be even more powerful than her Ice Snow Goddess Domain, and even had a countering effect.\n\nNie Bing controlled the Shadow Puppet to perform a few movements, and the Shadow Puppet immediately executed them according to his will. There seemed to be nothing amiss. As his spiritual power merged with the Demon-Devouring Blade, a divine light flashed in Nie Bing's eyes, and he lightly commanded, \"Release.\" A black stream of energy floated out from the hilt of the Demon-Devouring Blade, and the colossal figure from before instantly reappeared not far in front of Nie Bing and the Shadow Puppet. The Shadow Puppet did not lose control again, and the released Dark Demon Rat appeared extremely docile, lying on the ground without moving, merely blinking its huge eyes at Nie Bing, as if waiting for orders. Nie Bing's heart stirred. Through his spiritual power, he said to the Dark Demon Rat, \"Go catch a few Snow Chickens and bring them back.\" He wanted to see if he could truly control this giant rat that had been reabsorbed by the Shadow Puppet. As it turned out, his experiment was successful. The Dark Demon Rat stood up without any hesitation after receiving Nie Bing's command, turned around, and drilled back into the large hole it had emerged from, its massive body disappearing from view amidst a series of scraping sounds.\n\nThe Shadow Puppet remained calmly standing there, as if everything had nothing to do with it. Nie Bing's mind constantly pondered various thoughts, yet he couldn't determine what state his Shadow Puppet was truly in. If it possessed its own intelligence, then why could his spiritual power completely control it now? And he couldn't find any hint of intelligence. The Demon-Devouring Blade also remained as usual; neither the gem on the hilt nor the entire blade showed much change, other than being filled with dark aura. Demon-Devouring Blade, oh Demon-Devouring Blade, what secrets do you hold? Although Nie Bing couldn't yet determine what had happened before, he vaguely sensed that the changes in the Shadow Puppet formed by the Demon-Devouring Blade must be related to the deceased Dark Martial Emperor.\n\nMaomao looked at Nie Bing in surprise. \"Big Brother Nie Bing, how did that big rat come back? Why did it run away?\"\n\nNie Bing smiled bitterly. \"If I'm not mistaken, this Dark Demon Rat has probably been controlled by me. All seven of my blades are very strange, each with its own special origins. I don't know why this happened. Perhaps it's because the Dark Demon Rat belongs to the dark attribute. Or it might be that the spirituality of my Demon-Devouring Blade is too strong, and it absorbed the Dark Demon Rat's aura once it sensed it.\"\n\nIn a short while, the Dark Demon Rat's colossal body emerged from underground again, holding three still living Snow Chickens in its mouth, which it delivered to Nie Bing before docilely laying on the ground once more. Nie Bing suddenly realized that the Dark Demon Rat was so skilled at digging tunnels underground; if he could put this advantage to good use... As he thought of this, he couldn't help but reveal a wicked smile at the corners of his mouth.\n\nHis spiritual power entered the Demon-Devouring Blade, recalling the Dark Demon Rat, and simultaneously recalling the Shadow Puppet. Although he still had some reservations about the Demon-Devouring Blade, the thought of the Dark Demon Rat's utility greatly improved Nie Bing's mood. Without Maomao needing to urge him, he set to work. The three Snow Chickens were quickly cleaned thoroughly under the effect of ice magic. He found a few branches, removed the leaves and bark from them, then skewered the three Snow Chickens and set them up over the fire.\n\nBingyun walked to a tree nearby and sat down. She didn't even glance at Nie Bing, closing her eyes and meditating. Maomao's attention was entirely focused on the three Snow Chickens, and Nana the fox was continuously whimpering with desire.\n\nNie Bing smiled slightly. Having set up the three Snow Chickens, he began to work. His magical progress made controlling the flames even more skillful. The pre-mixed seasonings were evenly brushed onto the Snow Chickens, and he began to roast them. In a short while, a rich aroma filled the air, and the Snow Chickens' skin gradually turned golden brown. Snow Chicken meat was tender and succulent, and roasting was one of the best cooking methods. As the rich aroma continuously wafted out, Maomao bounced around excitedly, eagerly awaiting the Snow Chickens to be grilled. While grilling the Snow Chickens, Nie Bing stole a glance at Bingyun not far away. Bingyun seemed not to have smelled the aroma at all, remaining calmly seated there, meditating. Nie Bing had to admit that Bingyun was definitely one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen; only Feng Nü could compare to her. However, she was the disciple of an enemy.\n\nThe Snow Chickens were finally grilled. Nie Bing handed one to Maomao, who had already been impatient. Maomao took the Snow Chicken and happily ran to Bingyun's side. \"Big Sister, Big Sister, the chicken's grilled, you have some too!\" Saying this, she offered the Snow Chicken to Bingyun. Bingyun opened her eyes, looked at the innocent-faced Maomao, and, unusually, revealed a hint of a smile. She removed the veil from her face and said softly, \"Little sister, you eat it yourself. I won't eat his food.\" For some reason, looking at Maomao, the chilling aura around her disappeared on its own, and she simply couldn't bring herself to maintain a stern expression.",

    "content": "Maomao looked at Bingyun in surprise and said, \"Sister, what Brother Nianbing makes is really delicious, you should try some! Don't call me little sister, I'm already sixteen, just call me Maomao, everyone calls me that.\" As she spoke, she once again offered the snow chicken to Bingyun. Bingyun was stunned for a moment, looking at Maomao's innocent face, she truly couldn't bear to refuse. Plus, the snow chicken did smell quite good. Immediately, she reached out, took the branch, tore off a chicken leg, and then returned the branch to Maomao, \"You eat, sister has enough with just this.\"\n\nMaomao giggled, then began to eat heartily. With the craftsmanship of Ice Fire Nine Heavens, the snow chicken achieved its best flavor in Nianbing's hands. Not only did Maomao eat it with relish, but even Bingyun, who was usually abstinent, couldn't help but be moved after a few bites. The snow chicken's flavor, produced by different flames, created a mixed taste; with every chew, there was a completely different sensation. Although the Priestess of the Ice Snow Goddess doted on her greatly, the dishes at the Ice God Tower were always primarily vegetables, and the cooking methods were quite ordinary. Suddenly tasting such a delicacy, she couldn't help but savor it carefully. Compared to Maomao's wolfing down, she was much more refined, eating in small bites, every movement so graceful, without a trace of grease on her face.\n\nNianbing ate his own snow chicken while watching Maomao and Bingyun, a faint cold glint flashing in his eyes. The three snow chickens were quickly consumed. Nianbing ate one himself, Maomao ate over one, and Bingyun, who originally only intended to eat one chicken leg, also ate a considerable amount more due to Maomao's enthusiasm. Having tasted Nianbing's skill, Bingyun found it somewhat hard to understand why an excellent magician would dedicate his energy to cooking. To be able to make such delicious food could certainly not be achieved in just a day or two. Of course, she would not ask Nianbing about it.\n\nPoor Fox Nana could only pick up some chicken bones on the ground, looking discontentedly at her master. Unfortunately, Maomao didn't seem to notice her pathetic state.\n\n\"Maomao, we've finished eating. Let's set off. Once we reach Ice Moon City, you're not allowed to be mischievous anymore. I'll find someone to send you home.\" Nianbing said, while holding water formed from ice for Maomao to wash her face. Although he liked this little sister Maomao, he had many important things to do in Ice Moon City and feared that Maomao might be in danger if she stayed with him.\n\nMaomao washed the grease from her face and said somewhat aggrieved, \"Brother Nianbing, do you dislike Maomao? Maomao can protect herself, I won't be a burden to you. Let me stay with you. It's so hard for me to get out. If I go back, Father will definitely be angry and lock me up again.\" As she spoke, her eyes reddened, and she looked at Nianbing with an endearing expression.\n\nNianbing shook his head helplessly and said, \"Maomao, be obedient. Brother has some matters to handle in Ice Moon City, and it's inconvenient for you to follow me! What if something happens to you? How would I explain it to Uncle Hilarid?\" No sooner had he finished speaking than Bingyun, who was beside him, stood up, took Maomao's hand, and said, \"You don't need to worry about that. In Ice Moon City, as long as I'm here, no one can harm her. Maomao, let's ignore this overly cautious fellow. Let's go.\" With that, she took Maomao's small hand and walked out.\n\nNianbing looked at Bingyun in some surprise; she didn't seem as cold as he had imagined! He quickly quickened his pace, following behind the two girls, and walked out of the forest. Along the way, despite the awkward atmosphere between Nianbing and Bingyun, thanks to Maomao's mediation, all was well. Nianbing became the two girls' exclusive chef. At first, Bingyun somewhat scoffed at eating his food, but later, she seemed to have gotten used to Nianbing's delicacies. She didn't even need Maomao's persuasion, and her appetite was surprisingly no less than Maomao's. A few times, Nianbing made less food, and he even ended up with nothing to eat himself. In this seemingly harmonious atmosphere, five days later, they finally arrived at the capital of the Ice Moon Empire, Ice Moon City, which was only a hundred li* from the Ice God Tower.\n\nThe prosperity of Ice Moon City was not much greater than Ice Snow City. However, because it was the capital of the Ice Moon Empire, the entire city was permeated with a strong political atmosphere. Patrolling soldiers could often be seen on the streets, and there were few street vendors. The first impression the city gave was naturally its excellent public safety. A handsome magician in a golden magic robe, a woman with a veil over her face exuding a cold aura, and a charmingly cute girl immediately attracted the attention of the common people upon entering Ice Moon City. However, Nianbing and the two girls did not encounter any trouble. The reason was simple: the ice flower symbol on Bingyun's magic robe. In the Ice Moon Empire, everyone knew that offending the royal family might not be a death sentence, but offending the Ice God Tower would inevitably make life worse than death.\n\nAs they were walking, Bingyun suddenly stopped, holding Maomao's hand, and turned to Nianbing, saying, \"Where are you going?\" Her voice was still very cold, although the hatred in her eyes had diminished somewhat.\n\nNianbing smiled slightly and said, \"Let's find a place to stay first. Miss Bingyun can also go find help from your Ice God Tower. You can rest assured, I won't run away. Besides, Maomao is here, isn't she?\" As he spoke, he walked towards a large hotel by the roadside. A cold glint flashed in Bingyun's eyes, and she pulled Maomao, following Nianbing into the hotel.\n\nWith their Ice God Tower identities, the three stayed at the hotel for free. Nianbing requested two rooms, one for himself and one for Bingyun and Maomao. Just as he entered his room to rest for a while, Maomao ran over. \"Brother Nianbing, Sister Bingyun said she's taking me to play in the city! Are you coming? Come with us, Sister Bingyun said there are many delicious snack shops in the city. And various clothes made from the Ice Moon Empire's special furs. It's getting cold, Sister said she wants to buy me some clothes.\" Ice Moon City was north of Ice Snow City, and it was now late autumn, so it was indeed a bit cold.\n\nLooking at Maomao's joyful expression, Nianbing shook his head and said, \"You go with your Sister Bingyun. Brother is tired, so I won't go with you.\" No way, going shopping with girls would surely end miserably. Besides, he had some important things to do. Maomao gave Nianbing a dissatisfied look. \"Brother is really a spoilsport! Then you wait for us here. I'll even buy you a piece of clothing.\" With that, she skipped away. Watching her retreating figure, Nianbing truly envied the carefree Maomao. How great would it be if he could be as happy as her. But at least for now, it was impossible. Under his spiritual perception, he clearly felt Bingyun and Maomao leaving the hotel and heading north. Although he harbored hatred for everyone from the Ice God Tower, Bingyun had been exceptionally kind to Maomao throughout their journey. He believed Bingyun wouldn't harm Maomao. Moreover, Maomao, with her array of summoned beasts and spiritual magic, was definitely not as innocent-looking as she appeared.\n\nOpening the window, Nianbing clapped his hands three times. Two gray shadows glided in through the window and knelt on one knee. \"Cult Master, what are your orders?\"\n\nNianbing said indifferently, \"Take me to the Ice Moon Hall's branch. I think the people who should be here must have already arrived.\" Ten days had passed since he issued the command. Traveling day and night, at least some of the Blood Lion experts should have already gathered in Ice Snow City. Two green-ranked experts led Nianbing away from the hotel. They were clearly very familiar with the routes in Ice Moon City, guiding Nianbing through streets and alleys, and soon arrived in front of a tall building. Upon reaching this building, Nianbing couldn't help but be stunned. Because the symbol on the building was a sword, which represented the Warrior Guild. And the Warrior Guild in Ice Moon City was clearly the general headquarters of the entire Ice Moon Empire's Warrior Guild. Was the Blood Lion Cult's Ice Moon Hall actually here? With some doubt, he followed the two green-ranked experts into the guild.\n\nThere were many people in the Warrior Guild, most of them there to have their martial skill ranks assessed. The guild hall was thousands of square meters, and hundreds of warriors didn't make it seem crowded. Nianbing, in his golden magic robe, immediately attracted the attention of the warriors as soon as he entered the guild. His magic robe attire was simply too conspicuous. One of the two green-ranked warriors stayed by Nianbing's side, while the other quickly walked into the inner part of the Warrior Guild. Nianbing stood in the center of the Warrior Guild, observing his surroundings, and at least two-thirds of the warriors in the guild hall were also looking at him. Whispers continuously drifted over.\n\n\"Where's this kid from? He looks like a magician, what's he doing at our Warrior Guild? Is he here to stir up trouble? He's got too much nerve.\"\n\n\"Who knows where he's from? But I've never seen a magician wearing a golden magic robe before. He's really arrogant enough. Just looking at him makes me mad. Let's go, let's test him.\"\n\nThere were quite a few people eager to test Nianbing's strength. Nianbing was still observing his surroundings when dozens of warriors surrounded him. These warriors clearly had no good intentions. One tall warrior strode towards Nianbing's direction, but he seemed not to see Nianbing, his robust body directly charging towards Nianbing. Nianbing did not move; it seemed he also did not see the other party. Just then, a gray shadow flashed, and the green-ranked warrior remaining by Nianbing's side proactively collided with the tall warrior. With a dull thud, two bodies of completely disproportionate size collided but produced an unexpected result. The green-ranked warrior seemed as if nothing had happened, still standing by Nianbing's side, while the tall warrior was sent flying backward, caught by several other warriors before falling to the ground. The green-ranked warrior's action immediately caused a commotion; shouts erupted loudly, and the warriors quickly surrounded Nianbing and the other green-ranked warrior, but none of them used weapons.\n\nNianbing snorted coldly, stopping the green-ranked warrior beside him. The next moment, seven faint phantoms appeared in the Warrior Guild hall. Every warrior clearly felt a chill on their body, and when they subconsciously looked at themselves, they were horrified to find that whether they wore armor or a martial uniform, each person's chest had several neat cuts. The cuts formed two words—White.\n\nStrength proved everything. The warriors who had intended to provoke him all stopped their steps. Anyone who wasn't brain-damaged knew very well that if Nianbing wanted their lives, even if they had ten, they would have already vanished. Nianbing still stood there. The green-ranked warrior who saw him act for the first time couldn't help but have a sharp glint burst forth in his eyes. No one saw how Nianbing made his move. Although most of the warriors in the great hall had strength below that of Great Sword Masters, to be able to strike so many warriors in an instant without resistance, with such strength, no one dared to underestimate this golden-robed magician anymore.\n\nThe other green-ranked warrior returned. He nodded to Nianbing and led him towards the back of the Warrior Guild. The surrounding warriors automatically opened a path, watching Nianbing leave. Passing through a large door and walking down a wide corridor, the green-ranked warrior led Nianbing into a grand hall. The hall was luxuriously decorated. A middle-aged man who appeared to be over forty sat on a large chair. Seeing Nianbing enter, led by the green-ranked warrior, he stood up to greet him. \"Subordinate Yindang, Hall Master of the Ice Moon Hall, greets the Cult Master.\"\n\nYindang? Someone is named that? A trace of amusement rose in Nianbing's heart. \"Is this the branch of the Ice Moon Hall? Great power hidden in plain sight, this place is very good.\"\n\nYindang smiled slightly and said, \"Thank you for the Cult Master's praise.\" He didn't have the cold sternness of the Blood Snow Banner's banner master, but his perpetually smiling face appeared even more terrifying to Nianbing.\n\n\"Hall Master Yindang, since you know my identity, you must have also received my orders. How many people from our cult have arrived here now?\" Nianbing said calmly.\n\nYindang hesitated before saying, \"Reporting to Cult Master, this Hall's experts have assembled, but people from the other Halls have not yet arrived.\"\n\nNianbing raised an eyebrow. \"Oh? The Cheerlu Empire and Huarong Empire's Halls are far away and can be excused for now, but why haven't the people from Orlan Hall and Langmu Hall arrived? Is this the efficiency of our Blood Lion Cult?\"\n\nYindang straightened his body and said, neither obsequious nor arrogant, \"Reporting to Cult Master, as the seven elders of the Blood Lion Hall have not arrived, the other Halls of our cult still have doubts about your orders, and so have temporarily not moved.\"\n\nNianbing sneered, \"Good! It seems my position as Cult Master has not yet been acknowledged.\" He couldn't help but feel a bit anxious. The agreed-upon time with Longzhi was only three months. The main force of the Blood Lion Cult had not yet arrived. If he had to wait for the Blood Lion Hall to confirm his identity and then dispatch personnel again, the time would become even tighter. However, he couldn't blame the other four Halls for being cautious. After all, the Blood Lion Cult's power was so immense, and if the Cult Master was an imposter and issued an order to mobilize all combat personnel of the entire cult, it was certainly worth contemplating. There was no other way now; he only hoped that the seven elders would arrive quickly.\n\n---\n*   **Li (里)**: A traditional Chinese unit of distance, approximately 500 meters or 0.3 miles.

    "content": "Thinking of this, Nian Bing said, \"Hall Master Yin, since the seven elders haven't arrived yet, we should do some preparatory work first. Where are the materials I ordered to be searched regarding the Ice Moon Empire's princes?\"\n\nA gleam flashed in Yin Dang's eyes. He said, \"I apologize, Sect Master, but until you receive the acknowledgment of the seven elders of our sect, I cannot execute the orders you issue. Perhaps you are unaware that while the previous Sect Master had the right to nominate the next, to truly become the Sect Master of this sect, one must pass the assessment of the Blood Lion Hall's seven elders. Therefore, in a sense, you are not yet the true Sect Master. Everything must wait until the seven elders arrive before it can be decided.\" Although he spoke politely, the arrogance in his bones told Nian Bing, *Kid, you can't move me yet.*\n\nNian Bing looked up at Yin Dang. Yin Dang met his gaze calmly. Suddenly, Yin Dang felt a huge, shocking force emanate from Nian Bing's eyes. He couldn't help but step back, struggling to keep his eyes from meeting Nian Bing's. A feeling of dread rose in his heart. He was actually fifty-six years old this year, but due to his powerful strength, he looked like a man in his forties. He was one of the Blood Lion Sect's most promising individuals, already secretly designated as the next Blood Lion Sect elder. When he first met Nian Bing, he did feel a slight contempt. Nian Bing's ostentatious golden magic robe was completely contrary to his preferred reserved nature, and Nian Bing looked far too young. Therefore, he didn't believe Nian Bing could become the Blood Lion Sect's new Sect Master. However, just that one glance caused a huge shift in his mindset. The almost tangible mental power piercing was such that even with his Martial Saint-level strength, he dared not meet Nian Bing's gaze. Yin Dang felt a little alarmed. At this moment, Nian Bing's voice sounded in his ear, \"It seems I can't do anything now?\"\n\nYin Dang's heart tightened. He lowered his head and said, \"Sect Master, you can temporarily rest in the Ice Moon Hall. Wait for the Blood Lion's seven elders to arrive. I imagine they'll be here in a few days.\" As he spoke these few words, he suddenly felt it was very difficult. Nian Bing's person constantly exuded a powerful pressure, making it hard for him to breathe. That was not only pressure from a mental level but also from his physical body<sup>[1]</sup>.\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Alright, I won't bother Hall Master Yin then.\" After speaking, he turned and walked out. Things were indeed not as smooth as he had expected<sup>[2]</sup>. Although the Blood Lion Hall's latent strength was immense, it certainly wouldn't be easy for him to fully control it. They hadn't done anything wrong. After all, how could such a powerful force be controlled just by saying so?\n\nNian Bing left, but Yin Dang's heart felt uneasy and restless. Just then, his subordinate reported everything that had happened outside earlier. \"White, White<sup>[3]</sup>, who exactly are you?\"\n\nOutside the Warrior's Guild. Nian Bing hesitated for a moment, wondering if he should continue to leverage the Blood Lion Sect's power. The answer was yes. Before gaining control of the Blood Lion Sect's power, he had to do something first. Although it was conveyed that he couldn't temporarily be regarded as the Sect Master, the two Green-rank Warriors still followed him. Nian Bing called over one of the Green-rank Warriors and said, \"Take me to Bloodthirsty Soul-Exterminator's residence. I presume you know where he lives.\"\n\nThe Green-rank Warrior nodded and led the way. Nian Bing glanced back at the Warrior's Guild behind him, thinking to himself, *When I return, I will definitely control the entire Blood Lion Sect.*\n\nAs he walked, Nian Bing recalled the information he had gathered before leaving Ice Snow City: Bloodthirsty Soul-Exterminator Xue Po<sup>[4]</sup>, one of the Ice Moon Empire's Three Marshals, commanded the Ice Moon Empire's strongest cavalry regiment. He was known for his ruthless, iron-fisted approach<sup>[5]</sup> and possessed extremely formidable strength. In the Ice Moon Empire, he was definitely a figure of real power. At the same time, he was Xue Ji's elder brother and Xue Jing's paternal uncle. So far, this was all the information Nian Bing had. In Ice Moon City, besides the Blood Lion Sect, the only other connection he could forge was with Marshal Xue. He certainly wouldn't expect Xue Po to participate in the Regime Change Plan, but merely gaining some of his support would be enough. At the very least, he could help Nian Bing make the most crucial move.\n\nAs one of the Ice Moon Empire's Three Marshals, Xue Po's mansion covered a vast area. The two Green-rank Warriors brought him near the mansion, then Nian Bing had them leave first, and he walked alone toward the mansion's main gate.\n\n\"Who goes there? How dare you trespass on the Marshal's mansion?\" Four soldiers guarding the gate stopped Nian Bing. Nian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Greetings, sirs. I have come from Clear Wind Abode in Ice Snow City and wish to request an audience with the Marshal.\"\n\nThe guards scrutinized Nian Bing from head to toe for a few moments, then said, \"Wait here.\" With that, one of them went into the mansion to report. After a short while, the guard returned with a man who looked like a butler. The butler looked at Nian Bing with some doubt and said, \"You're from Clear Wind Abode? I don't recall seeing you before.\" Nian Bing's golden magic robe raised some suspicions in him.\n\nNian Bing took a letter from his pocket: \"Please hand this letter to Marshal, I believe he will see me then.\" This letter was precisely the letter of recommendation he had Xue Ji write before leaving Ice Snow City. Since he had determined what he needed to do in Ice Moon City, Nian Bing had made some preparations. The butler took the letter and returned to the Marshal's mansion. Nian Bing was not in a hurry, standing by the mansion gate and looking out at the street. Just then, a carriage drove up to the Marshal's mansion gate. The carriage looked very luxurious. Servants accompanying the carriage lifted the curtain, and two people stepped out, one after the other.\n\nTwo women stepped down from the carriage. The first to descend was younger, appearing to be in her twenties, with bright eyes and pearly white teeth, looking quite beautiful. The second was a middle-aged woman, dressed splendidly yet without losing an air of elegance. Surrounded by servants, they walked toward the main gate. Nian Bing quickly stepped aside, clearing the path to the gate. Both women were momentarily stunned when they saw him. The young woman looked at Nian Bing's handsome features with some surprise and asked a nearby guard, \"Who is he? Why is he standing at our mansion gate?\"\n\nThe guard hurriedly stepped forward and replied, \"Miss, he claims to be from Clear Wind Abode in Ice Snow City and requests to see the Marshal. The butler has already taken the letter he brought inside for the Marshal to see.\"\n\nThe young woman was clearly interested in Nian Bing. \"Oh? You're from Clear Wind Abode? Then you must know my cousin, right?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"If you're referring to Xue Jing, then yes, I do know her. Presumably, you are Marshal Xue's esteemed daughter.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! My name is Xue Yu. I haven't been to Ice Snow City to play in a long time. I really miss Uncle Ming's Golden Scent Rings.\" Seeing Xue Yu's expression, Nian Bing thought to himself, *Another gluttonous girl.*\n\nThe beautiful middle-aged woman smiled slightly and said, \"Since you are from Clear Wind Abode, you are not an outsider. You may come in with us. I imagine my husband will see you.\"\n\nNian Bing followed the beautiful woman and Xue Yu, finally entering the Marshal's mansion. After only a few steps, they encountered the butler coming towards them. As soon as Madam Xue inquired, it was indeed as expected: Xue Po had sent the butler to invite Nian Bing.\n\nXue Yu had initially wanted to ask Nian Bing about Clear Wind Abode, but Madam Xue pulled her away. Nian Bing followed the butler through three courtyards before finally arriving outside Bloodthirsty Soul-Exterminator Xue Po's study. After the butler announced their arrival, he led Nian Bing into the study. As soon as he entered, Nian Bing saw Xue Po sitting behind the desk. Xue Po was tall and sat there reading a book. His appearance resembled Xue Ji's by at least seventy percent. What surprised Nian Bing was that Marshal Xue Po, known as the Bloodthirsty Soul-Exterminator, actually exuded a rich scholarly aura. He looked more like a learned scholar. Where was any sign of an iron-fisted demeanor? Of course, Nian Bing was no longer a shallow, ordinary person; appearance was not enough to judge someone. He quickly stepped forward and bowed, saying, \"Nian Bing greets Marshal Xue.\"\n\nXue Po put down the book in his hand. He picked up the letter Nian Bing had given the butler earlier and said, \"You were sent by Xue Ji, correct? Xue Ji mentions in the letter that you are his friend. What brings you to see me?\" Xue Po's voice was clear and lacked the deep resonance of Xue Ji's, yet it sounded very comfortable to the ear. Nian Bing and Xue Po met each other's gaze. From Xue Po's eyes, he saw a hint of coldness.\n\nNian Bing said, \"I came to Ice Moon City this time to see a friend, and I also need Marshal Xue's help. My friend is His Royal Highness, the Seventh Prince Yan Feng of the Ice Moon Empire.\"\n\nXue Po looked at Nian Bing with some surprise, a hint of strangeness in his gaze. \"You want to see Yan Feng? He only recently returned to Ice Moon City. Although I am an important minister at court, I cannot simply meet with a prince.\" The King of the Ice Moon Empire was gravely ill, and this was precisely when the princes' struggle was most intense. As someone who had always maintained neutrality, he had consistently declined the princes' requests. How could he casually meet with a prince now?\n\nNian Bing recalled Yan Feng's particular hobby/preference, and couldn't help but inwardly smile wryly. With a hobby like Yan Feng's, it would be hard for Marshal Xue *not* to misunderstand. *Yan Feng, oh Yan Feng, just let me take the blame for this,<sup>[6]</sup>* he said calmly, \"Marshal, you don't need to be troubled. You just need to tell me where Yan Feng is, and I will find my own way to see him.\" With his current strength, what were the Imperial Palace's defenses?\n\nXue Po frowned and said, \"Thank you for delivering the letter for my brother, but I cannot help you with this matter. If there's nothing else, you may leave.\"\n\nSeeing Xue Po's expression that kept people at arm's length,<sup>[7]</sup> Nian Bing smiled slightly and said unhurriedly, \"Marshal Xue won't help me? Is it because you're afraid of getting into trouble? Actually, I just want to meet a friend. Telling me Yan Feng's whereabouts shouldn't be very difficult for Marshal Xue, should it?<sup>[8]</sup>\"\n\nXue Po snorted coldly, \"What a joke. I, Xue Po, have never known what fear is. However, you are merely a small magician. What makes you think you can make me help you?\" Originally, Xue Ji had asked him in the letter to look after Nian Bing. But thinking of Nian Bing being friends with that Seventh Prince who had peculiar tastes, an indescribable contempt rose in Xue Po's heart.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"In that case, I apologize for my rudeness. Marshal Xue, the current situation in the Ice Moon Empire is delicate. As an important minister of the Empire, do you not consider the future of the Ice Moon Empire?\"\n\nXue Po's brow furrowed. \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"It means nothing much. I just feel that Marshal Xue, as one of the Ice Moon Empire's Three Marshals, does not support any of the Ice Moon Empire's princes. Although you hold a high position and great power, and no matter which prince inherits the throne, they will certainly reuse you, do you not think more for the Empire? Currently, the most hopeful candidates to inherit the throne are naturally the First Prince, Second Prince, and Fifth Prince. If those three contend, it will inevitably lead to political unrest, which is detrimental to the Ice Moon Empire's development.\"\n\nXue Po snorted coldly and said, \"What do you know? The Aolan Empire and the Langmu Empire were both severely weakened<sup>[9]</sup> after their war with the Huarong Empire. Only these two nations border ours. Even if our nation's political situation experiences some turmoil, as long as I, Xue Po, am still here, they won't dare to have any ideas. The Aolan Empire has always been on good terms with us, and the Langmu Empire recently suffered a defeat, severely weakened. Do they dare to scheme against our nation? Kid, who exactly are you? As a mere commoner, concerning yourself with politics will do you no good. For Xue Ji's sake, I won't make things difficult for you, but if you speak carelessly again, don't blame me for being impolite.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"I spoke out of turn. Please forgive me, Marshal. Then, I have another request, which certainly won't trouble you. I'd like to stay at the Marshal's mansion as a cook. May I?\"\n\nXue Po was stunned for a moment. \"What did you say? You want to be a cook? Looking at your attire, you should be a magician, shouldn't you?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Who says a magician cannot be a cook?\" As he spoke, he took off the golden magic robe draped over him, revealing the commoner's clothes underneath. His long white hair was scattered over his shoulders, making him look somewhat peculiar.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing's white hair and commoner's clothes, Xue Po frowned and said, \"What trick are you trying to pull?\"\n\nNian Bing put on a surprised expression and looked at Xue Po, \"Marshal, did Uncle Xue Ji not tell you in his letter that I am a cook? Uncle Xue Ji has already decided that I will represent Clear Wind Abode in the Culinary God Competition five months from now. I believe my cooking will surely satisfy you. When I entered the Marshal's mansion just now, I met Miss Xue Yu. She seemed to really like Clear Wind Abode's Golden Scent Rings. What a coincidence, I happen to know how to make that dish. Having just arrived in Ice Moon City, my travel funds have run out. I don't need much remuneration, just a place to stay will be fine, Marshal.\"\n\nXue Po said skeptically, \"You're really a cook? This is the first I've heard of a cook who can use magic. Alright, I'll give you a chance. It's almost noon. As long as you can prepare a meal that satisfies me, I'll let you stay as a cook in the mansion. Guards!\"\n\n\"Yes, Marshal.\" A servant entered from outside and bowed to Xue Po.\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n<sup>[1]</sup> Original text ends with \"**\", indicating an incomplete or censored word, likely \"肉身\" (ròushēn) or \"身體\" (shēntǐ), meaning \"physical body\" or \"body.\"\n<sup>[2]</sup> The original Chinese phrase \"小秒年個升毫秒年個\" (xiǎo miǎo nián gè shēng háo miǎo nián gè) appears to be garbled text or a transcription error, making no coherent sense.

    "title": "Chapter 140: The chef of Yuanli Mansion (Part 1)",
    "content": "Xue Po pointed at Nian Bing and said, \"Take him to the kitchen. My lunch today will be prepared by him. No one is allowed to help him, understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, Marshal.\" The servant nodded to Nian Bing, then turned and walked out of the study first. Nian Bing bowed to Xue Po and followed him out.\n\nWatching Nian Bing's departing figure, Xue Po muttered to himself, \"Xue Ji, Xue Ji, just who is this person you've introduced to me? It seems I really need to get to the bottom of this.\" Thinking this, he summoned another servant, hastily wrote a letter, and ordered the servant to deliver it to Ice City with the utmost speed.\n\nThe Marshal's Residence's dining hall was exclusively for Xue Po's family. At noon, Xue Yu, already a little hungry, pulled her mother to the dining hall. As soon as she entered, she smelled a pervasive rich fragrance and exclaimed in surprise, \"It smells so good! What dish is this?\" When she saw the dishes on the table, she couldn't help but stare. Could the items arranged on the table even be called dishes? They were clearly works of art. The only thing she recognized was a plate of golden-colored Golden Fragrance Rings. Including the Golden Fragrance Rings, there were only six dishes in total, yet every single one was of the highest quality. Just their color and aroma alone had already whetted Xue Yu's appetite.\n\nMadam Xue was equally surprised. Looking at the exquisite dishes before her, she asked with doubt, \"Did a new chef come to the residence? Looking at these dishes, the chef's skill is truly impressive.\"\n\n\"Indeed, a new chef has arrived. Isn't it me?\" Nian Bing's voice sounded. He walked in, holding his specialty, the Nine-Layered Heaven of Ice and Fire's Nine Dragon Supreme Cauldron. The jade-green Supreme Cauldron held two-thirds full of Pearl Jade White Jade Porridge. Carefully placing the Nine Dragon Supreme Cauldron in the center of the dining table, Nian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"I wonder if my craftsmanship can satisfy Madam and Young Miss.\"\n\nXue Yu looked at Nian Bing in surprise and said, \"You're a chef? I remember you were wearing a magic robe when you arrived!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"That was just for show. Since I came from Clear Wind Pavilion, I am naturally a chef. This time, I came to be introduced by Uncle Xue Ji to work at the Marshal's Residence.\"\n\nXue Po just then entered from outside, having settled things. He also smelled the pervasive fragrance. As he entered, he naturally saw Nian Bing and his wife and daughter. Looking at the extraordinarily exquisite seven dishes on the table, his eyes couldn't help but light up. Although he usually didn't have high demands for food, the seven dishes Nian Bing had made were simply too tempting. Especially the Nine Dragon Supreme Cauldron in the center; its delicate carving was definitely not something an ordinary chef could accomplish.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Marshal, please inspect my culinary skills. I believe you will be satisfied.\" Although he hadn't prepared his best Seven-Element Feast, these seven dishes were all from his earliest created Nine-Layered Heaven of Ice and Fire cuisine. Each one was meticulously crafted. If even these couldn't satisfy Xue Po, then perhaps there would be very few chefs on the entire Yangguang Continent who could.\n\nXue Po glanced at Nian Bing, then walked to the head seat and sat down. Madam Xue quickly served a bowl of rice for her husband and placed it before him. Xue Yu was already impatient. \"Daddy, I'm eating already, okay? It looks like the chef Uncle introduced to us is really amazing. Last time when we went to Ice City, you asked Uncle to lend us Uncle Ming Yuan, but Uncle just wouldn't agree. This time, it's great! He really sent us a master chef. From now on, I'll be in for a treat!\"\n\nXue Po said in a deep voice, \"You lass, you have no decorum whatsoever. Where do you look like a girl? Don't learn from your elder sister. Do you also want to be called a madwoman? Eat.\"\n\nXue Yu was clearly afraid of Xue Po. She stuck out her tongue, not daring to say anything more, and immediately started on the dishes on the table.\n\nNian Bing stood to the side, not withdrawing. Watching Xue Po's family of three eat the delicacies he had prepared, his heart surged with emotion. How he wished he could also share lunch with his parents! But ever since he could remember, this simple wish for ordinary people had never been fulfilled.\n\n\"Wow, it's so delicious! What is this made of? The taste is so incredibly fresh! I've never eaten anything this good before. It even seems tastier than what Uncle Ming Yuan makes!\" After tasting the Eight Extremes of Ice and Fire Delicacy, Xue Yu couldn't help but exclaim again. This time, however, Xue Po did not stop her, because he too was astonished by Nian Bing's culinary skill. The seven dishes on the table were not only visually appealing; their flavors were unique. Seemingly ordinary ingredients, after being processed by Nian Bing, transformed into exquisite delicacies. Each bite offered a different sensation, and even the plainest rice was filled with a rich aroma.\n\nSeeing Xue Po pick up a Golden Fragrance Ring, Nian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Delicate hands form jade into several strands, emerald oil fries out deep tender yellow. In the night, spring sleep has no weight, flattening the beauty's arm-wrapped gold. A good Golden Fragrance Ring must not only be golden in color, but also fragrant, crispy, and brittle, crumbling at the slightest touch. That is a top-grade Golden Fragrance Ring. I think I've managed to achieve that, barely.\"\n\nXue Po said nothing. He brought the Golden Fragrance Ring to his mouth and took a bite. Indeed, just as Nian Bing had said, it was fragrant, crispy, and brittle, crumbling at the slightest touch. The rich aroma filled his mouth, making him unable to resist eating the entire Golden Fragrance Ring in one go. The food on the table steadily diminished. Neither Xue Po, Madam Xue, nor Xue Yu had ever eaten so much food before. Including the Nine Dragon Supreme Cauldron that Nian Bing brought out last, all seven delicacies were consumed, not a trace left. Watching the family of three finish the last of the food, Nian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Thank you, Marshal, for your praise.\"\n\nXue Po glanced at Nian Bing and said, \"How do you know I'm praising you?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"For a chef, seeing the food they've made eaten completely is naturally the greatest praise, isn't it, Marshal Xue?\"\n\nXue Po nodded to Nian Bing. Although he felt some doubt about Nian Bing's identity, to be able to create such a table of delicacies was not something one could learn in a day or two of cooking lessons. Within his Marshal's Residence, no chef possessed such skill, so even if someone had wanted to help him, it would have been impossible. After tasting Nian Bing's craftsmanship, the doubts in his heart lessened somewhat. \"Good, consider yourself passed. From now on, you are a chef in my Marshal's Residence. However, you must remember that the household rules here are extremely strict. If you break them, don't blame me for being ruthless. How much remuneration do you want?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Marshal, remuneration doesn't matter to me. Money is fleeting like clouds and smoke.* However, I have a small request. I've come to the Marshal's Residence to be a chef, but from now on, I will only prepare dinner. Having just arrived in Ice Moon City, I wish to wander around and engage in more discussions with the famous chefs here. Therefore, I request Marshal's permission to not be present in the residence during the day.\"\n\nXue Po hadn't spoken yet, when Xue Yu, beside him, said somewhat frankly, \"Then you won't be able to make lunch for us! Oh, right, what's your name?\"\n\n\"My name is Nian Bing. Marshal, might you be able to grant me this condition?\" Although Nian Bing was answering Xue Yu's question, his gaze remained fixed on Xue Po.\n\nLights flickered in Xue Po's eyes. He said, \"Alright, I'll permit you to only prepare dinner. Since you were introduced by Xue Ji, I won't treat you unfairly. From now on, your monthly remuneration will be twenty gold coins. Have the butler arrange your lodging.\" Having said that, he stood up and walked out of the dining hall. As soon as Xue Po left, Xue Yu immediately jumped up and sidled closer to Nian Bing, saying, \"Nian Bing, your culinary skills are so superb! Are you even more amazing than Uncle Ming Yuan?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"One cannot say that. Chef Ming Yuan and I merely have our own strengths. Young Miss, I shall take my leave now.\" With that, he bowed to Madam Xue and exited the dining hall. Nian Bing naturally had his own reasons for deciding to stay at Xue Po's residence as a chef. If he wanted to change the tides, he would naturally need to enter the chaotic political situation within the Ice Moon Empire. Xue Po held an extremely high position in the Ice Moon Empire, and staying in his residence would allow Nian Bing to avoid many unnecessary troubles, thus greatly benefiting his actions.\n\nAfter first finding the butler to arrange his lodging, Nian Bing left Xue Po's Marshal's Residence and returned to the inn. Maomao and Bing Yun had already returned. As soon as she heard the sound from his door, Maomao quickly ran over and grumbled, \"Brother Nian Bing, where did you go?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"Brother went to find a job to do. I can't just sit around eating away my fortune!\"*\n\n\"A job? You mean work? Where does Brother work?\" Maomao asked curiously.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"Don't ask about that. Brother found a chef's job, but I'll only work there in the evenings and will be back the next morning. Maomao, are you staying here with Sister Bing Yun for now, or do you want to go home?\"\n\n\"No way, I don't want to go home! Sister Bing Yun is great; she bought me so many good things the other day. Brother Nian Bing, wait for a bit, okay?\" Saying that, she turned and ran out. When she returned, she held a fur coat. The fur was brownish-yellow, with fine, dense short hairs radiating a faint luster, clearly an item of considerable value. Maomao handed the fur coat to Nian Bing. \"Brother, this is what I bought for you. It's getting cold, how can you always wear so little? Brother, you must be very tired, your hair has turned white!\"\n\nTaking the soft fur coat, Nian Bing felt a warmth in his heart. He knew Maomao was genuinely good to him. \"Thank you, Maomao. Brother's hair turned white not because of tiredness. Maomao, this coat must have cost you a lot of money, right? How can Brother accept something from you?\"\n\nMaomao giggled, \"It's okay, Maomao doesn't have money. I borrowed the money from Sister Bing Yun, and Sister Bing Yun even helped me pick out this coat! She said this snow ferret fur is the warmest. Brother, hurry and try it on to see if it fits.\"\n\nNian Bing couldn't bear to refuse Maomao's kindness. He put on the snow ferret coat. Indeed, not only was the coat very warm to wear, but it was also very light and extremely comfortable. It fit Nian Bing perfectly.\n\n\"That's great! Brother Nian Bing, that coat fits you perfectly. It seems Maomao bought the right one!\" Maomao clapped her hands happily, as if she herself had received something wonderful.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"Maomao, Brother can't just accept your gift without giving anything in return. Let's find something as a return gift.\" As soon as the words left his mouth, he realized his oversight. He didn't have anything valuable on him except for his seven magic knives. A thought stirred within him, and Nian Bing took Maomao's hand and said, \"Let's go, we'll borrow some things from your Sister Bing Yun.\"\n\nNian Bing led Maomao to Maomao and Bing Yun's room. Bing Yun was sitting on the bed meditating. Sensing Nian Bing's presence, she immediately opened her eyes and said coldly, \"Who told you to come to our room?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Maomao gave me a coat, and I must give her something in return. Miss Bing Yun, could you lend me a few blank scrolls? I'll buy new ones and return them to you another day.\"\n\nBing Yun frowned, but still took out three blank scrolls and tossed them to Nian Bing. Nian Bing didn't return to his room; he immediately spread out the three best blank scrolls on a nearby table. Rainbow light swirled, and the Heaven's Eye Domain floated into existence about a foot around his body. Nian Bing thought for a moment, then immediately gathered his magical power and began to draw on the scrolls. His actions not only caught Maomao's attention but also made Bing Yun stand up and watch Nian Bing from a short distance away.\n\nNian Bing's fingers trembled, and graceful patterns gradually appeared on the blank scrolls. His movements were extremely fast, each magic symbol naturally formed. As the symbols grew more complex, Bing Yun, who had always prided herself on her profound understanding of magic, was surprised to discover that many of the magic symbol combinations Nian Bing drew were unfamiliar to her. She had also put in painstaking effort into magic arrays, but Nian Bing's speed was simply too fast. She could only vaguely sense some things, but couldn't determine what kind of magic Nian Bing was drawing. As the magic symbols became more numerous and complex, Nian Bing's movements gradually slowed. The final completion process of a magic scroll was the most crucial. If even a single mistake was made, or if the magical power infusion was uneven, the blank scroll would immediately be ruined.\n\nRed and blue lights flickered alternately, and the three scrolls were completed simultaneously. Nian Bing folded the scrolls, then separately injected the final surge of magical power into each. Only then did he clap his hands in satisfaction and say, \"Success.\"\n\nHe tucked the three scrolls into Maomao's hands and smiled faintly, \"Maomao, carry these three scrolls with you. These are all Ice-Fire Dual-Origin Trigger Magic Scrolls. When activated, their power can reach above Rank Seven. With your innate spiritual power, you should be able to control their power easily. They are most suitable for self-defense. I've set different defense levels for the three scrolls, so when you are attacked to varying degrees, one of them will activate. Consider this Brother's return gift to you.\"\n\n\"Great! Thank you, Brother Nian Bing!\" Maomao tucked the three magic scrolls into her embrace. She didn't know the power of these three scrolls, but Bing Yun understood them perfectly. To be able to generate magic of Rank Seven intensity, and for them to be legendary Trigger Magic Scrolls, with not a single failure during their creation—the value of these three scrolls was simply immense. Nian Bing's almost miraculous display of magic couldn't help but make her look at him with new respect.\n\n\"Nian Bing, how much longer do you plan to stay in Ice Moon City?\" Bing Yun asked coldly. Her meaning, naturally, was asking when Nian Bing would return to the Ice God Tower with her.\n\n---\n*   **Money is fleeting like clouds and smoke:** Literally \"Money is originally fleeting like clouds and smoke.\" This idiom means money is transient or not truly important.\n*   **Eating away my fortune:** Literally \"to sit and eat until the mountain is empty.\" It means to live idly, consuming one's resources without working, eventually leading to poverty.",

    "content": "Nianbing smiled faintly and said, \"Once I've finished my business, I will naturally leave here. However, I can't be sure how long it will take, but it definitely won't be more than three months.\"\n\nBingyun said, slightly annoyed, \"Three months? Where do I have that much time to waste on you?\"\n\nNianbing said, \"Then you are welcome to find people to capture me at any time. As long as you can catch me, you can naturally take me to the Ice God Tower.\"\n\n\"You...\" It wasn't that Bingyun hadn't thought of using the Ice God Tower's power to capture Nianbing and bring him back. However, a Magician with an Innate Domain was no worse than an ordinary Archmage, especially with Nianbing's bizarre Innate Domain. Furthermore, he had his strange Shadow Puppet, which left her with no confidence at all. If she brought people from the Ice God Tower to catch Nianbing, it would likely result in considerable losses.\n\nMoreover, she was finding Nianbing's strength increasingly unfathomable. Without any confidence, she preferred to wait. After arriving in Ice Snow City, she hadn't rushed to contact the Ice God Tower's forces, perhaps also because of Maomao. Although Bingyun hated Nianbing, she also found that this man she detested was leaving an increasingly deep impression on her heart. His powerful magic, his exquisite culinary skills—each left a profound mark on her. At noon today, she and Maomao had casually eaten something outside, and she was surprised to find that she had no interest whatsoever in snacks she had previously considered delicious. Only then did she realize she had already grown somewhat accustomed to Nianbing's cooking.\n\n\"Brother Nianbing, Sister Bingyun, please don't argue, okay?\" Maomao looked from one to the other, thoroughly disliking the tense atmosphere.\n\nNianbing smiled slightly and said, \"Alright, no more arguing. Big brother will go back first. You stay with Sister Bingyun.\" After speaking, he glanced at Bingyun, then turned and returned to his room.\n\nBack in his room, Nianbing began his daily meditation. His actions today had been quite unsuccessful; not only had he failed to utilize the Blood Lion Sect's power, but even Xue Po was unwilling to help him meet Yan Feng. It seemed helping Yan Feng ascend to the throne wouldn't be easy! A single person's strength was, after all, too insignificant.\n\nHowever, he truly had no other usable forces within the Ice Moon Empire. For now, he could only take things one step at a time, hoping the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion Hall would arrive soon. He didn't know what their test would be, but as long as it wasn't too difficult, he should be able to pass it.\n\nNot long after Nianbing began cultivating with the Innate Method, a change suddenly occurred within his body. The grey energy that Oscar had in his chest suddenly trembled. Immediately afterward, a faint golden light spread out from the center of the grey glow. Nianbing felt his heart skip a beat. An ineffable sensation instantly spread throughout his body, and a layer of fine, grey scales unconsciously condensed on the surface of his skin. On these scales, a few faint shimmering golden lights also appeared.\n\n\"Yay, yay, yay, I succeeded!\" Oscar's excited voice echoed in Nianbing's mind.\n\nNianbing said, annoyed, \"Succeeded at what? Can you please retract these scales for me first? Kaka, if I'm walking down the street and you suddenly sprout scales, I'll strangle you.\"\n\nOscar chuckled, \"I was just too excited, can't blame me. I'll definitely pay attention next time.\"\n\nNianbing asked, somewhat curious, \"What did you succeed at? Did you manage to find a way to use your energy so quickly?\"\n\n\"Not that. But I've successfully cultivated the first layer of our Dragon Clan Mind Method, so of course I'm happy. Although I still can't effectively utilize my energy, mastering this first layer of the mind method will greatly enhance my strength. Since I'm inside your body, my increased strength benefits you too! Haven't you noticed that your body is now a bit tougher? Moreover, with this first layer of the mind method, my energy is more condensed than before. Perhaps I'll soon figure out the properties of my own energy. I'm already getting somewhere; I believe it won't be too long.\"\n\nNianbing said, \"Kaka, we're currently sharing this body. Is there any possibility that our energies could merge under specific conditions? If so, with my Ice and Fire Dual-Source magic power plus the other five elements of magic, combined with your abilities, it would definitely greatly enhance our overall strength.\"\n\nKaka thought for a moment and said, \"That doesn't seem very likely. Although I don't know why, my Dragon Power doesn't repel your strength, but what you humans cultivate is quite different from the Dragon Power we dragons cultivate. Merging them would be very difficult. However, because we share a body, you could say our souls are connected. When you encounter danger or become particularly agitated, I can sense it and immediately awaken from my dormant state. Since I can't fully comprehend my own energy yet, it's unlikely I can help you attack, but helping you defend our shared body should be fine. Also, I've found that after your energy awakened, whenever you are in a meditative state, my cultivation speed becomes exceptionally fast. It seems your magic power is of great help to me. Nianbing, when you sense danger yourself, you can also actively awaken me to help you defend. With my defensive power, unless it's a forbidden spell, ordinary magic or physical attacks will find it very difficult to harm our body. Oh, right, the Dragon Clan Mind Method I'm cultivating was stolen from my dad's mind back then. You absolutely must not tell anyone. This mind method can only be cultivated by the Dragon God's successor. Just now, when I broke through the first layer, I suddenly had a feeling that even if you can't fully open the Seven Acupoints to help me reshape my body, once I reach the thirteenth and highest layer of the Dragon God Mind Method, I might be able to reshape my body on my own. My energy is simply too strange; even the Dragon Clan themselves have no record of it. Who knows, maybe in the future I can become an unprecedented powerhouse among dragons. Hehe.\"\n\nNianbing suddenly thought of something and quickly asked, \"Kaka, if I were to let you control the body right now, do you have the ability to obtain others' secrets again?\" If he could use Kaka's ability to get the secrets in Bingyun's heart, then rescuing his parents might become possible, and some of his later plans wouldn't need to continue.\n\nOscar said, \"That's not possible anymore. That ability of mine is very peculiar and quite weak compared to my own Dragon Power. I can only obtain another person's secrets when they completely open themselves up to me. Forcibly trying to know someone's secret is impossible, at least for now. I can try once my ability reaches a certain level of strength. Right now, my ability in this area is too weak; I'm afraid of a backlash. What? Have you taken a fancy to another girl? Want to know her inner secrets?\"\n\n\"Shut up, am I that kind of person? I'm doing it for something else.\" Kaka's answer left Nianbing somewhat disappointed. He knew his plans would still have to proceed.\n\nKaka chuckled, \"Of course you are that kind of person. But watching your 'spring palace' performances is really quite enjoyable; even I get hot-blooded.\"\n\n\"Damn it.\" Nianbing raised his middle finger to the air. \"You pervert, you'd better not let me find out which female dragon you've taken a liking to in the future, otherwise, don't blame me for retaliating.\"\n\nOscar said with a fawning smile, \"Boss, don't do that. We're one now, after all! I'm younger than you, so I'm like your little brother. How can you treat me like this? How about this? The next time you get intimate with your wife, just let me know beforehand, and I'll sleep like a log and absolutely won't disturb your good times.\"\n\nNianbing snorted, \"That's more like it. Alright, let's cultivate together.\" Having a dragon help him with defense felt quite good after all.\n\nIn the evening, Nianbing said goodbye to Maomao and left the inn again. Maomao was reluctant to let him leave, but Nianbing promised to make her breakfast and lunch the next day, which allowed him to depart. Bingyun was naturally astonished when she learned from Maomao that Nianbing was going out to work as a chef. She truly couldn't figure out what Nianbing was up to, but with Maomao there, she wasn't afraid that Nianbing would simply run off.\n\nReturning to the Marshal's Residence, Nianbing prepared a lavish dinner for Xue Po's family, offering a variety of dishes, before returning to his own room. Since he had to wait, he wasn't anxious; improving his strength every moment was paramount. His meditation lasted from after dinner until dawn the next day. Nianbing clearly felt that his strength had increased further, and his Archmage realm was completely stable. The energy contained within the seven magic orbs in his body was already extremely vast; even without the augmentation of his Heavenly Eye Domain, casting two ninth-tier spells simultaneously was no longer so difficult.\n\nFive days passed in a row. Nianbing lived a very regular life during this time: every morning, he returned from the Marshal's Residence to the inn to make breakfast for Maomao and Bingyun; in the mornings, he quietly cultivated at the inn; at noon, he cooked for them again; in the afternoons, he occasionally strolled casually through the streets; he returned to the Marshal's Residence before evening to prepare dinner; and after dinner, he went straight back to his room to meditate until the next morning.\n\nAt first, Xue Po was very uneasy about Nianbing and kept dispatching high-ranking individuals from his residence to monitor him. However, as five days passed, Nianbing did nothing detrimental to the Marshal's Residence, only interacting with Maomao and occasionally taking her out onto the street. Furthermore, Nianbing's culinary skills were indeed exquisite, which gradually put Xue Po at ease. Today, Xue Ji's reply arrived, praising Nianbing's cooking highly in the letter, which greatly relieved Xue Po and caused him to withdraw the surveillance on Nianbing.\n\nAll of this transpired covertly, but Nianbing was well aware of what Xue Po had done. With the powerful observational ability of his Heavenly Eye Acupoint, no surveillance could escape his perception.\n\nAfter lunch, Nianbing decided not to go out today. He returned to his room at the inn, sat cross-legged on the bed, and prepared to begin cultivating. Almost all his free time was dedicated to cultivation. He clearly knew that his current strength was still insufficient to contend with experts of the Spiritfall Master level. To achieve a breakthrough, he couldn't hope for miracles; everything depended on his own efforts, steadily improving his strength step by step.\n\nJust as Nianbing was about to enter a meditative state, a faint tapping sound came from the window. Nianbing had already sensed who it was and said softly, \"Come in.\"\n\nThe window silently opened, and a figure glided in. It was one of the two Green Rank Warriors who had followed Nianbing to Ice Snow City. He first bowed to Nianbing, then said, \"Reporting, Sect Master, the Elders of the Blood Lion Hall have arrived. Please come over.\"\n\nNianbing's heart rejoiced; they had finally arrived. He nodded to the Green Rank Warrior and said, \"Alright, let's go.\" He cast a Wind Soaring Spell on himself and, following the Green Rank Warrior, floated out of the window towards the Warrior Guild.\n\nThe Warrior Guild was different today. A sign at the entrance read: \"Internal Guild Activities, All Business Temporarily Suspended.\" When Nianbing arrived at the guild entrance, Yin Dang, the Hall Master of Ice Moon Hall, personally welcomed him inside. From Yin Dang's expression, Nianbing clearly understood that the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion Hall had already proven their identities.\n\nYin Dang respectfully said, \"Sect Master, you have arrived. Please come in.\"\n\nNianbing nodded and followed Yin Dang into the Warrior Guild. Led by Yin Dang, he arrived at the same room where he had first met Yin Dang. The room was large; even twenty or thirty people wouldn't feel crowded. As soon as he stepped through the door, Nianbing immediately felt a tremendous sense of oppression wash over him. That was definitely not an ordinary aura; only true masters could possess such powerful presence.\n\nThere were seven people in the room. They had been sitting on sofas, but upon seeing Nianbing enter with Yin Dang, they all rose and nodded to Nianbing, saying, \"The Seven Elders of Blood Lion greet the Acting Sect Master.\" None of them bowed, but it was clear that seeing Nianbing so young, a hint of surprise appeared in the eyes of all seven elders.\n\nActing Sect Master? The addition of \"Acting\" seemed to imply that before passing their test, he wasn't truly the Sect Master yet! With a slight smile, Nianbing said calmly, \"Elders, there's no need to be polite. Please be seated.\"\n\nThe seven elders were dressed differently. The lead elder appeared much older than Nianbing's grandfather, Prince Rong. His aged face was covered with the marks left by wind and frost. He was dressed very simply, a greyish-white cloth robe covering his medium build. He seemed full of vigor, and his dim, yellowish eyes burst with two dazzling flashes of light when he met Nianbing's gaze.\n\nThe other six elders were divided into two types of attire. They all appeared to be roughly the same age as the lead elder, at least eighty or ninety years old. However, Nianbing could clearly sense through his Heavenly Eye Acupoint that explosive, vast energy was contained within these bodies in their twilight years. Three of these six elders wore magic robes that bore no symbols indicating their rank, and they belonged to the Fire, Ice, and Dark elements. Nianbing was startled to see that one of the three elders was from the Dark element, as Dark Magicians were very rare in the current magical world. The other three elders were dressed in well-fitting warrior uniforms. Although their clothes were not elaborate, wearing them gave them a sense of towering strength, like a deep abyss or mighty mountain.",

    "content": "Yin Dang did not linger long in the room. Before leaving, he closed the door properly. Nian Bing clearly felt that he was guarding the entrance. As a Hall Master, commanding all of the Blood Lion Cult's hidden forces in the Ice Moon Empire, he was actually guarding the door for the Seven Elders. This showed just how high the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion's status was within the Blood Lion Cult.\n\nNian Bing and the Seven Elders took their seats. The other six elders sat with their eyes closed to rest, only the elder who had previously spoken to greet him faced Nian Bing and said, \"Acting Cult Master, we wish to know the purpose of your summoning a large number of the Blood Lion Cult's combat personnel to Ice Moon City this time. If your purpose is greatly beneficial to our Cult, then even if you haven't ascended to the position of Cult Master, we will support you in completing this Operation Change the Heavens. Otherwise, you will only be able to issue Cult Master's orders after passing our test.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. Although the elders hadn't said it, he knew his test had already begun. The Seven Elders of the Blood Lion had arrived, and instead, he felt less anxious. He smiled, \"I haven't yet asked for the names of the Seven Elders.\"\n\nThe elder calmly replied, \"We stopped using names long ago. You only need to know that we all bear the surname Rong. You may address me as Grand Elder. I am also the Chief Elder of the Blood Lion Hall.\" As he spoke, he pointed to the Dark Mage in black mage robes beside him and said, \"This is the Second Elder.\" Following that, he pointed them out one by one to Nian Bing, informing him of the elders' rankings. Among them, the Second Elder, Fifth Elder, and Sixth Elder were mages, while the other three elders were warriors.\n\nNian Bing was secretly surprised. \"As expected, it's the Rong family's influence! These seven elders are probably all old-generation masters, peers of my own grandfather in the Rong family. Such a vast underground force, even the Huazhong Empire must be somewhat wary of it.\"\n\n\"Grand Elder. Then I shall address you as such. It was presumptuous of me to invite the elders here this time, but there is indeed a major undertaking to be done.\"\n\n\"Please wait a moment.\" The Grand Elder interrupted Nian Bing. \"I need to know your identity. There's something I must tell you first. Other members of this Cult can be outsiders, rising in rank according to their ability and merit. However, only the Cult Master and the Elders of the Blood Lion Hall must bear the surname Rong. Since the Demon Lion passed the position to you, I assume you understand the meaning of this position.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Yes, I understand. The Blood Lion Cult's greatest purpose is to be an aid to the Rong family. Should anything happen to the Rong family, what I need to do is protect everything belonging to the Rong family. My surname is Rong. The previous Cult Master, the Demon Lion, was my grandfather. My name is Rong Nianbing, and you may also call me Bai.\"\n\nThe Grand Elder looked at Nian Bing with some surprise and said, \"We truly didn't expect the Demon Lion to pass on the position to you after only serving as Cult Master for a few years. It seems he had his own considerations. However, do you think you are capable of the task?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart skipped a beat. Prince Rong had ruled the Rong family for decades. How, in the Grand Elder's words, did he seem to have only served as Cult Master of the Blood Lion Cult for a few years?\n\nThe Grand Elder seemed to have seen Nian Bing's confusion and calmly said, \"Before he became Cult Master, he served as Acting Cult Master for fifty-two years. Because at that time he had not passed our test, he could not become the Cult Master in the true sense. It was only a few years ago that he finally passed the test and gained our recognition, becoming someone who could truly command the Blood Lion Cult. Once recognized by us, the Cult Master holds absolute power over life and death within this Cult.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart trembled violently. He knew Prince Rong's strength all too well. According to the Grand Elder's words, it seemed Prince Rong only truly became Cult Master after reaching the Divine Descendant Master level. It appeared his own test today would not be that simple!\n\nAlthough surprised internally, Nian Bing showed no expression on his face. He smiled calmly and said, \"Grand Elder, what do you believe I must do to be capable of this position? I promised my grandfather that after becoming the future hidden protector of the Rong family, I would consider the difficulties. The Blood Lion Cult indeed possesses a power beyond my imagination, but I also understand that becoming a Cult Master truly recognized by the Blood Lion Cult is not so easy.\"\n\nThe Grand Elder looked at Nian Bing, smiled faintly, and said, \"It seems you are very confident. You are the Demon Lion's grandson. Speaking of which, you should call me Great-Grandfather. Back then, Rong Yan stood out among all the Rong family's descendants. Although I am his father, I still passed my Cult Master position to him, making him Acting Cult Master. For many years, though he couldn't fully command the Blood Lion Cult's forces, he also didn't do anything wrong. I originally thought he would pass the Cult Master position to Rong Yue, but I didn't expect it to fall to you. You must be Rong Yue's son, right?\"\n\nNian Bing suddenly stood up from his seat. Seeing the trace of benevolence in the Grand Elder's eyes before him, he bowed without any hesitation. Great-Grandfather! He was actually his grandfather's father, his own great-grandfather! Although Nian Bing had already held these seven elders in high regard, he hadn't expected their status to be so esteemed. \"Your great-grandson Rong Nianbing greets his Great-Grandfather, and the Great-Granduncles. Great-Grandfather, the Rong Yue you mentioned is my paternal uncle. My father is Rong Tian.\"\n\nThe Grand Elder looked at Nian Bing with some surprise and said, \"You are actually Rong Tian's son? I remember the Demon Lion told me Rong Tian was driven out of the family about ten years ago. Has your father returned then?\"\n\nA hint of sorrow appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. He shook his head, remaining on his knees, and recounted his life story and everything his parents had experienced in detail.\n\nAfter listening to Nian Bing's narration, the Grand Elder slightly furrowed his brow. \"Alas, I met your father a few times back then. Rong Tian was a very good child. If he had been able to develop within the Rong family, his achievements would not have been inferior to his brother's. It's a pity. For the sake of a woman, he ended up in such a state. Nian Bing, are you blaming your grandfather?\"\n\nNian Bing calmly replied, \"Great-Grandfather, do you think I should blame my grandfather? If my grandfather had been willing to support my father's and mother's marriage, perhaps today's situation wouldn't have arisen. I have now rejoined the Rong family. I don't wish to dwell on what happened before, but the revenge for my parents cannot be forgone.\"\n\nThe Grand Elder looked at Nian Bing, his gaze shifting from benevolent to calm. \"So, you're saying your deployment of the Blood Lion Hall this time is to deal with the Ice God Pagoda? Nian Bing, there's something I must tell you. Within the Blood Lion Cult, no one can act purely for personal gain. Let alone you being only an Acting Cult Master now, even if you become the true Cult Master, we seven still have the authority to veto your proposals. Do you understand? However, I believe you wouldn't have mobilized our Cult's forces solely for personal revenge. Otherwise, we can only blame the Demon Lion for misjudging you.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"Great-Grandfather, my parents' revenge is mine. I never thought of relying on others to avenge them; you needn't worry about that. My deployment of so many people has only one purpose: to change the heavens. To change the heavens of the Ice Moon Empire.\"\n\nThe Grand Elder looked at Nian Bing with some surprise and said, \"Tell me about it.\"\n\nNian Bing stood up. Sitting back in his seat, an invisible, faint sense of authority emanated from him. \"Elders, you should all be aware of the current situation in the Ice Moon Empire. Because the Ice Moon Empire has not engaged in war for over a hundred years, the entire empire is in a state of recuperation. On the surface, the Langmu Empire appears to be our Huazhong Empire's greatest rival. However, that is not the case. The Ice Moon Empire's national strength might not be comparable to the Langmu Empire's now, but I dare say, in terms of combat power, they are absolutely stronger than Langmu. This can be seen just from the Ice God Pagoda. With the powerful ice mages of the Ice God Pagoda in the Ice Moon Empire, they pose a great threat to our Rong family. Therefore, only by completely destroying the Ice God Pagoda can the flames of our Rong family potentially burn in every corner of the continent. Of course, my current operation is not directly targeting the Ice God Pagoda. The Ice God Pagoda's current development relies primarily on the appeal of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. However, without the full support of the Ice Moon Empire, they could not have achieved their current supreme status. Therefore, to move against the Ice God Pagoda, we must first isolate it. To isolate it, we must start with the Ice Moon Empire. The Ice Moon Empire is the foundation of the Ice God Pagoda; as long as we can bring the Ice Moon Empire under our control, then the Ice God Pagoda will no longer be formidable.\"\n\nThe Grand Elder was already over a hundred years old. Although Nian Bing hadn't explicitly stated it, he already understood Nian Bing's meaning. \"You mean, we should exploit the current struggle for succession among the Ice Moon Empire's princes?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"This is the best opportunity. Currently, the struggle for succession involves three parties: the First Prince, the Second Prince, and the Fifth Prince. If I'm not mistaken, the First Prince and Second Prince, fearing the Fifth Prince might seize their throne due to the Ice Moon Empire King's favor, will inevitably unite to deal with him first. Although the Fifth Prince is favored, he is ultimately unable to contend with the combined strength of the two princes. This is evident from his trip to Ice Snow City to seek support. However, he also has the King's support, which makes the First and Second Princes hesitant to act. My Operation Change the Heavens is very simple: to support one prince to ascend the throne. If this prince can be completely under our control, then, elders, do you think that would be beneficial to our Blood Lion Cult and the Rong family? Of course, I am very aware of the difficulty of the Operation Change the Heavens succeeding. We can only secretly use various situations to force the outcome we desire.\"\n\nThe Grand Elder fell into thought after hearing Nian Bing's words, and the other six elders slowly opened their eyes. The pressure in the room noticeably increased. Nian Bing sat there, facing the Seven Elders without the slightest fear, awaiting their thoughts.\n\nAfter a while, the Grand Elder said, \"What you propose is indeed very tempting. Although our Blood Lion Cult has substantial underground influence, many of our activities cannot be brought into the open. If we could control a nation, it would be of immense benefit to the ultimate goal of our Rong family. However, this is easier said than done. How can you guarantee that the prince we support will still obey our command after gaining the throne? I want to hear which of these three princes you intend to support.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"I have no intention of supporting any of them. I haven't met the First Prince or the Second Prince, but given that they are candidates for the throne, they undoubtedly possess considerable advantages in various aspects. Such individuals, even if controllable for a time, cannot be controlled forever; given any opportunity, they would likely be very detrimental to our Blood Lion Cult. As for the Fifth Prince, there's no need to even mention him. I've met him; he's a very gloomy person whose emotions are unreadable. Such a person is simply uncontrollable. Therefore, the one I want to support is the Seventh Prince, the least conspicuous of the current seven princes. I know him. He has no desire for power whatsoever, and our relationship is good. Controlling him would be much easier than controlling the other princes. I wonder if this choice satisfies the elders?\"\n\nThe Grand Elder carefully observed Nian Bing, as if trying to discern something from him. After a long time, he sighed lightly and said, \"I'm beginning to understand why your grandfather passed this Cult Master position to you. For many years, the successive Cult Masters of our Blood Lion Cult, including myself and your grandfather, mostly focused on maintaining the status quo, yet none have been as daring as you. If this operation fails, the blow to our Blood Lion Cult, and even the entire Rong family, would be immeasurable. Of course, if this operation succeeds, the benefits to us would also be immense. To be able to propose this idea, you are indeed a talent. It seems it was not wrong to place you in the Acting Cult Master position. Although I also understand that to some extent, you still have some personal motives within this – you want to deal with the Ice God Pagoda and avenge your parents. But who, as a human, can be without personal motives? Moreover, the Ice God Pagoda is something we intended to deal with anyway. I find this operation you proposed very interesting and worthy of consideration. However, the specific details must be carefully discussed. From now on, I temporarily grant you the ability to mobilize all intelligence resources of this Cult. As for the Cult's combat forces, they can only be mobilized when the plan is thorough and has at least a seventy percent chance of success. Of course, you also have a shortcut to fulfill your wish: as long as you can pass the Cult Master's test, we seven old fellows will not make things difficult for you, and you can freely do whatever you wish. At that time, we will entirely obey your command, unless you commit a major error sufficient to overturn the entire family. Otherwise, you will become the supreme ruler of the Blood Lion Cult.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"I have already heard Hall Master Yin Dang speak of the test, but I don't know how I will be tested to confirm my Cult Master identity.\" He clearly understood that even Prince Rong had to reach the Divine Descendant Master level to pass the test, so it would likely be extremely difficult for him to pass. However, his continuous cultivation in recent days had greatly increased Nian Bing's confidence. Even if the test was incredibly arduous, he would give it a try.",

    "content": "The Grand Elder smiled faintly and said, \"The trial is actually very simple. There's only one question.\" As he spoke, he waved his hand, and a stick of incense appeared in his grasp. Watching the spatial magic item that the Grand Elder had casually summoned, Nian Bing's heart stirred. So, this Grand Elder was a Magus. But why didn't he wear a magic robe like the other three Elders?\n\nWhile Nian Bing felt puzzled, the Grand Elder continued, \"Passing the trial is very simple. This stick of incense is called Dragon Heaven Incense. Although it's very thin, it burns for a long time, probably about half an hour. The fragrance has the effect of calming the mind and soothing the spirit. The trial begins when the incense is lit and ends when it extinguishes. During this process, as long as you can withstand the full attacks of us seven old fellows, you will have passed.\"\n\nHearing the Grand Elder's words, Nian Bing couldn't help but gasp in a cold breath. He could be certain that these seven Elders, all over a hundred years old, were Martial Saint and Magus-level masters. Moreover, given their age, their combat experience was naturally extremely rich. To endure their combined powerful assault for half an hour was indeed too difficult for him. Just thinking of the combined power of these seven Elders sent a chill down Nian Bing's spine.\n\nThe Grand Elder, seeing Nian Bing's stunned expression, smiled faintly and said, \"Of course, you can choose not to participate in the trial for now. We won't make things difficult for you. Since you are the acting Cult Master, you are the primary target for cultivation in our Rong family's next generation. You are still young, and there is plenty of time ahead. Whenever you feel you can withstand this trial, you can come to us seven at any time.\"\n\nTaking a deep breath, Nian Bing gazed into the Grand Elder's eyes and said firmly, \"I'd like to try.\"\n\nThe Elders looked at Nian Bing with some surprise. Originally, when Nian Bing entered this room, they felt very strange. In the history of the Blood Lion Cult, no one had ever become an acting Cult Master at such a young age. Although the acting Cult Master's power wasn't great, it symbolized the Rong family's best cultivation prospect for the next generation. These seven Elders combined were over seven hundred years old; how could they take Nian Bing seriously? At this moment, after hearing the trial method, Nian Bing still decided to give it a try. The seven Elders couldn't help but secretly admire the courage of this junior.\n\nThe Grand Elder reminded him, \"You must think this through carefully. During the trial, we absolutely will not hold back. If you suffer any injuries because of this, hindering your future development, then we have the right to revoke your position as acting Cult Master.\" After all, he was his own great-grandson, and the Grand Elder felt a little reluctant for Nian Bing to accept this trial now.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"How can I know I can't do it if I don't try? Esteemed Elders, you are all the most senior members of the family by generation. I believe you must also understand the difficulties of the Heaven-Changing Operation. If, during the operation, I have to ask for instructions from the Elders for everything and cannot effectively command my subordinates, then the chances of success will be greatly reduced. If I cannot become the Cult Master, then I would rather abandon this operation. Therefore, I must brave this trial today.\"\n\n\"Good, you have great courage. I didn't expect the Rong family's next generation to produce a talent like you. From your demeanor, it seems you are very confident in yourself. Very well then, we shall grant your wish. But you must remember, although you are our junior and we are all blood relatives, no one will go easy on you during the trial. Our attacks will be delivered with full power. Everything depends on yourself. Yin Dang, come in.\"\n\nThe door opened, and Yin Dang walked in from outside. Although he was at the doorway, the room had been subjected to a soundproofing barrier by several Magus Elders, so he hadn't heard any of the conversation inside.\n\n\"Grand Elder, do you have any instructions?\"\n\nThe Grand Elder calmly said, \"Take us to the Ice Moon Hall's underground martial arena. At the same time, order your subordinates to seal off everything within five *li* around the underground martial arena, allowing no one to disturb us.\"\n\nYin Dang glanced at Nian Bing with some surprise. He was an old member of the Blood Lion Cult, and from the Grand Elder's instructions, he naturally understood what was about to happen. He hadn't expected Nian Bing to actually accept this trial. His gaze towards Nian Bing couldn't help but show a bit more admiration. Let alone a twenty-year-old youth, even a Martial Saint-level master like him would never have the courage to endure the trial of the seven Elders! Recalling Prince Rong, who had once been severely wounded and nearly lost his life, Yin Dang's look at Nian Bing changed from admiration to pity. However, his hesitation lasted only for a moment. He dared not disobey the Grand Elder's command.\n\nNian Bing and the seven Elders, led by Yin Dang, entered the backyard of the Warrior's Guild. Yin Dang dismissed all his subordinates and, through some complex operations, opened a secret passage within the rock garden in the backyard. Only then did he lead Nian Bing and the seven Elders down the secret passage.\n\nNian Bing couldn't help but find it a little amusing. As expected of an underground force! The real bases were all underground. As he walked, he noticed that the air in this underground world wasn't stuffy. He wondered what method Ice Moon Hall used. Even after they had gone several hundred meters underground, they could still breathe fresh air. As he walked, Nian Bing rapidly absorbed the surrounding Innate Energy using his Innate Qi. Even if he only improved his strength by a tiny bit, his chances in the upcoming trial would be stronger.\n\nDeep underground, by calculating the steps, Nian Bing estimated that he and the seven Elders were likely already at a depth of five hundred meters underground. As expected of a sect that had been established for a thousand years! How much manpower and material resources would such a massive project require to complete?\n\nWhile thinking, he was led into an underground plaza and stopped. This plaza was about ten *zhang* high and two hundred meters in diameter. The expansive plaza was entirely hewn from granite. Nian Bing could clearly feel a rich magical aura on the already sturdy granite.\n\nYin Dang explained, \"This is our Ice Moon Hall's secret training base, a place specifically for cultivating combat talents. Those who come here for intensive training are all top experts from the Hall's various banners. Around the plaza are also some special cultivation facilities. Only by passing trials of iron and blood can one leave this place. Any member of our Cult who comes here, if they cannot pass the seven item trials set by the instructors, will never leave this place in their lifetime.\" Saying this, he smiled faintly at Nian Bing before continuing, \"I am an instructor.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"The Blood Lion Cult truly lives up to its reputation as the most powerful underground force on the continent. A base like this, let alone attacking it, would be incredibly difficult just to find.\"\n\nYin Dang said, \"Precisely. This underground base is about four hundred and eighty meters underground. The base was almost entirely hollowed out from a gigantic granite rock. Above, below, and around us, there are at least tens of *zhang* of granite. Forget digging three feet deep, even digging thirty *zhang* deep wouldn't uncover this place. There are special switches in the base. Once a switch is activated, the entire base enters a sealed state, and it's impossible for enemies to find it. Therefore, this is both where we train new recruits and a place for contingency in times of crisis.\"\n\nThe Grand Elder said, \"Yin Dang, you may go. Activate the mechanism to seal this place when you leave.\"\n\nYin Dang responded, bowed respectfully to the seven Elders and Nian Bing, and then withdrew. As he left, he gave Nian Bing an encouraging look. The Blood Lion Cult was extremely strict with its subordinates, and he deeply felt the extraordinary qualities of this new acting Cult Master.\n\nAs a rumbling sound echoed, the massive noise was accompanied by only a slight tremor in the underground plaza. The entrance they had used was now sealed, yet the air within the plaza remained unchanged.\n\nNian Bing could feel that the Innate Qi here was very rich. Perhaps it was connected to some earth vein. If one were to choose to cultivate in seclusion here, it would be quite good.\n\nWhen the last crevice in the stone wall quietly closed, Nian Bing's heart also entered a state as calm as a placid ancient well. His Heavenly Eye Point was fully open, his energy diffused to its maximum, and his mental power expanded to every corner of the surroundings, fully sensing the energy fluctuations in the air, while simultaneously absorbing various magic elements with all his might to enhance his magical power. At this moment, his abilities had reached their peak state.\n\nThe seven Elders slowly moved aside. The Grand Elder waved his hand, and the Dragon Heaven Incense appeared again. With a flash of light, the Dragon Heaven Incense was already stuck far away in a socket on the stone wall, its tip lit, emitting a wisp of faint smoke. Seeing this scene, Nian Bing was startled. Only then did he understand that this Grand Elder was neither a warrior nor a Magus, but a Battlemage! At the same time, he couldn't help but inwardly smile bitterly. He was facing three Magi, three Martial Saints, and one Battlemage. The methods he used against Hilad and Bing Yun back then wouldn't work. Not to mention that his Eternal Sleep magic array had limitations, even if it could be effective, his combat power would be greatly weakened. Without mental power, how could he control his seven Shadow Puppets? It seemed there was no chance for trickery today.\n\nThe seven Elders did not rush to attack. The Grand Elder said, \"Since there are seven of us working together, and you are so young, we will not use any weapons or magic items. Whether you can pass the trial depends on your own strength. The trial begins now.\" As he spoke, he raised his hand and struck out a palm towards Nian Bing. A dark red stream of qi, solid yet unscattering, assailed Nian Bing's chest like a sharp blade. The other six Elders also moved. The three Magus Elders simultaneously retreated, while the three Martial Saint Elders gracefully advanced, bringing forth formidable battle qi to cooperate with the Grand Elder in attacking Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing knew that the battle qi attack was just the first wave. The true full-scale assault would begin after the three Magi completed their incantations. He dared not be negligent. His eyes shone brightly, and a layer of milky white light emanated from his glabella. The Heavenly Eye Domain instantly opened, controlled within a three-*zhang* radius around his body. Simultaneously, seven Shadow Puppets appeared with seven Divine Blades. Under the amplifying effect of the Heavenly Eye Domain, they shone with intense seven-colored radiance. The seven Divine Blades were raised simultaneously, interweaving seven elemental energies. Under Nian Bing's control, the Shadow Puppets did not launch an attack but waited until the three streams of battle qi and one stream of magic battle qi entered the Heavenly Eye Domain's range before beginning to defend. Nian Bing once again deeply experienced the defensive power of the Heavenly Eye Domain. The moment the Elders' attacks entered the Heavenly Eye Domain's range, the domain automatically reacted, rapidly weakening the attributes within their battle qi and, simultaneously, forming viscous shield-like shapes under the influence of seven elemental magic power, significantly weakening the attacks of the four Elders.\n\nThe Dark Shadow Puppet moved first under Nian Bing's control. Its Magic Devourer Blade emitted a faint light, meeting the Grand Elder's magic battle qi. The other six Shadow Puppets, ice paired with fire, wind paired with light, and space paired with earth, simultaneously met the attacks of the other three Elders. For this first attempt, Nian Bing chose to directly face the attacks of the four Elders.\n\nBoom, boom, boom, boom, four muffled thuds rang out. Under the recoil of the force, Nian Bing's face turned pale, and he staggered back three steps before stabilizing himself. The light on the seven Shadow Puppets simultaneously dimmed, then immediately returned to normal. Light and shadow flickered. The Dark Shadow Puppet then broke free from Nian Bing's control. Its black figure instantly reached its speed limit, actually bypassing the four Elders in front and lunging directly towards the three Magi behind them. Nian Bing only felt his body violently vibrate for a moment, but he quickly returned to normal. He no longer bothered with the out-of-control Dark Shadow Puppet. With a flash of silver light, his body instantly shifted sideways by three *zhang*, dodging the four Elders' ensuing attacks. After all, delaying time was the most important thing.\n\nThe four Elders attacking Nian Bing simultaneously revealed expressions of surprise. But their reactions were incredibly swift. Two immediately broke off to turn towards the Dark Shadow Puppet behind them, while the Grand Elder and the Fourth Elder continued to attack Nian Bing. The Grand Elder was extremely fast, his body seemingly skimming the ground, accentuated by a dark red glow. His hands struck out in alternating motions, palm after palm blocking all directions around Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing was not flustered. A faint smile appeared on his face. With a summon of his right hand, amidst flashing silver light, the spatial Shadow Puppet drifted over and merged with his body. The versatile Hexagram Swivel Blade also entered his grasp at this moment. With the blade in hand, Nian Bing's figure flickered. When he reappeared, he was already ten *zhang* away. Spatial magic was the best method for dealing with warrior attacks, and this method of merging with a Shadow Puppet was something Nian Bing had only just researched in the past five days. At this moment, his body's speed was exactly the same as the spatial puppet's. Wherever his mind willed, his body instantly flickered. Although the two Elders were both Martial Saints, they had no way to deal with Nian Bing's continuous flickering body. Seizing this opportunity, Nian Bing dispatched the remaining five Shadow Puppets, their target precisely the three Magi. As long as he prevented the Magi from exerting their full strength, Nian Bing was confident he could contend with the two Martial Saint-level masters, seeking no merit, only avoiding fault.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n*   **Li (里):** A traditional Chinese unit of distance, approximately 500 meters.

    "title": "Chapter 142 The Strongness of the Shadow Puppet (Part 1)",
    "content": "The Shadow Puppet's target was very clear: the Second Elder, who specialized in dark magic. The Soul-Devouring Blade in its hand dragged out a black streak a *zhang* long, enveloping the Second Elder head-on. The two Martial Saint Elders behind them pounced simultaneously, attacking the Shadow Puppet directly, using offense as defense, aiming to force it to defend. However, the Shadow Puppet's strength far exceeded the two Elders' estimations; its attack on the Second Elder remained unchanged, while a gigantic figure suddenly appeared behind it, staunchly blocking the two Elders' attacks.\n\nWith two thuds, the Third Elder and Seventh Elder, caught off guard, were sent flying backward. This sudden appearance was none other than the Dark Demon Rat, subjugated by the Shadow Puppet and stored within the gem of the Soul-Devouring Blade. The Dark Demon Rat's mountain-like body, after blocking the two Elders, immediately spewed a black flame, charging directly at the other two Mages. This sudden change immediately reversed Nian Bing's previously unfavorable situation.\n\nThe Second Elder naturally sensed the Shadow Puppet's power. The ominous evil aura enveloping him forced him to react; his chanting spell was interrupted midway. His hands joined, and a black halo floated upwards. Combining his own magical power with a low-tier scroll, the black light released by the Second Elder conversely enveloped the Shadow Puppet. But at that moment, something astonishing happened to him: the Soul-Devouring Blade suddenly transformed into a black blade net in the air. The dark energy he released was actually forcefully drawn in, instantly merging with the Soul-Devouring Blade's energy, and surprisingly becoming the Shadow Puppet's own energy. Not only that, the Second Elder felt as if his entire body's magical power was frantically gushing out, as if it wanted to escape his body. He had never encountered such a situation before, but his century of combat experience was profound after all. He immediately took a step back, relying on powerful spiritual strength to forcefully sever that pulling force. However, although he severed the pulling force, the Soul-Devouring Blade also descended.\n\nIn this critical moment, two magical lights appeared simultaneously. Two powerful seventh-tier magical constructs formed a barrier in front of the Second Elder, staunchly blocking the Soul-Devouring Blade's attack. A bloodstain appeared on the Soul-Devouring Blade; it instantly shattered two seventh-tier spells. The Shadow Puppet moved with its blade, its speed increasing again, pursuing the retreating Second Elder.\n\nThe Seven Elders of Blood Lion Hall had cooperated for a long time. Seeing that the Second Elder was completely countered by the Shadow Puppet, the First Elder and Fourth Elder immediately abandoned Nian Bing and rushed back. At this point, the Third Elder and Seventh Elder had also blocked the light spewed by the Dark Demon Rat towards the Mages and were fighting it. Surging black energy continuously gushed from the Dark Demon Rat. Although part of its energy was absorbed by the Shadow Puppet, it was, after all, a powerful magical beast that had undergone fifth-tier evolution. Although its mountain-like body was not agile in movement, streaks of dark currents filled with corrosive power surged out like waves, blocking most of the Third Elder's and Seventh Elder's attack power. For a time, the two Elders truly had no way to deal with it.\n\nAt the same time, five beams of light simultaneously lit up. The first to attack was the Light Shadow Puppet; the brilliant dawn light that pierced through heaven and earth shone brightly, its appearance precisely in front of the Sixth Elder. A wind-like cyan figure, accompanied by a soft murmur, moved towards the Fifth Elder; it was precisely the Wind Shadow Puppet. At that moment, the Fifth Elder's magic erupted, unexpectedly trapping both the Light Shadow Puppet and the Wind Shadow Puppet, making them unable to attack the Sixth Elder amidst the continuous energy collisions. And the Sixth Elder, at this time, also began chanting a long magic spell. The Earth Shadow Puppet, on the other hand, integrated into the Dark Demon Rat's body, greatly increasing its defense, staunchly resisting the Third Elder's and Seventh Elder's attacks.\n\nRed and blue lights blocked in front of the Dark Demon Rat. Nian Bing clearly knew that if the First Elder and Fourth Elder were to team up with the Third Elder and Seventh Elder, the Dark Demon Rat would be utterly unable to resist them. Therefore, the Ice and Fire Shadow Puppets, the moment they appeared, had their energy boosted to its limit by Innate Qi. The Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God simultaneously created a net of light, red and blue lights intertwining in the air, blocking in front of the two Elders.\n\nHowever, the two Elders' strength was truly too great, especially the First Elder's combat qi filled with fire attribute. Although Ice and Fire originate from the same source, and immense power was unleashed under the interaction of two extreme energies, it still could not completely stop them. The First Elder and Fourth Elder simultaneously unleashed a punch. Amidst a loud boom, they broke through the Ice and Fire from the Same Source attack. At the same time, the First Elder, utilizing the rebound force, instantly accelerated his body in mid-air. His hands conjured countless palm shadows; the dark red light surprisingly converged into a single stream in the air, heading directly for the Shadow Puppet's back.\n\nThe Second Elder snorted coldly. The black magic robe on his body suddenly replaced his body, confronting the Shadow Puppet's body, while he himself instantly retreated three *zhang* away. It was precisely the Puppet Art among dark magic.\n\nThe magic robe split into two. The Shadow Puppet instantly turned around. The Soul-Devouring Blade in its hand erupted with a dense black flame, and it clashed head-on with the First Elder's full-power attack.\n\nThe Shadow Puppet's body and the First Elder were simultaneously sent flying backward. At this point, the Fifth Elder, having freed up time, had already controlled the Wind Shadow Puppet and Light Shadow Puppet with magic. The spell that the Sixth Elder had been continuously chanting was almost successful. And the Fourth Elder also relied on his Saint Combat Qi to maneuver between the Ice and Fire Shadow Puppets, barely fighting the two Shadow Puppets to a standstill.\n\nJust as the situation was about to change, Nian Bing suddenly appeared. His position was precisely on the Dark Demon Rat's back. Seven-colored light was released without any reservation, instantly covering the entire battlefield. With the support of the Heaven's Eye Domain, the six Shadow Puppets and the Dark Demon Rat were all greatly invigorated mentally, while the Second Elder, Fifth Elder, and Sixth Elder, who were using magic, simultaneously felt their magical power stagnate and their power significantly weakened. It wasn't that Nian Bing didn't want to help his Shadow Puppets sooner. However, although the Shadow Puppets' energy was separate from his, each relying on one of the seven divine magic blades, their spiritual power was still connected to Nian Bing. Just now, when the Shadow Puppet initiated its attack, and Nian Bing sent out five Shadow Puppets to assist it, Nian Bing suddenly discovered a problem: these seven Shadow Puppets of his seemed to have broken through a realm in terms of energy; they were much stronger than before. Especially the Shadow Puppet, which had even surpassed ordinary Martial Saints. The other six puppets also possessed strength approaching the Martial Saint level. The increase in energy was naturally a good thing, but for Nian Bing, who had been continuously releasing the Heaven's Eye Domain and controlling the Shadow Puppets, it was an immense burden. If not for the Heaven's Eye Acupoint, he might even have been unable to control these Shadow Puppets simultaneously. That was why he was a bit slower in speed. But with such a good opportunity, how could he let the Seventh Elder regain the advantage? Regardless of cost, he immediately unleashed the Heaven's Eye Domain at full power on the Dark Demon Rat's back, maximizing both the amplification and weakening functions, assisting his \"bodyguards\" in launching a frenzied counterattack against the Seventh Elder.\n\nThe First Elder let out a long howl in mid-air. Originally, all seven Elders had somewhat underestimated Nian Bing. But Nian Bing was, after all, their junior. Although they didn't say it, they had only used fifty percent of their strength when they first engaged. But the sudden change on the battlefield made it so the First Elder could no longer hold back. His howl was to tell his brothers to unleash their full power.\n\nThe Third Elder, Fourth Elder, and Seventh Elder simultaneously abandoned their opponents and rose into the air, meeting the First Elder in mid-air. And the Fire Shadow Puppet, Ice Shadow Puppet, Light Shadow Puppet, and Earth Shadow Puppet also returned to Nian Bing's front at double their previous speed. The dark red current spewed by the Shadow Puppet was even stronger than before, heading directly for the four Elders in the air. The four Shadow Puppets also each raised their sources of energy; the four divine magic blades shone brightly, launching attacks simultaneously. Four blade beams converged in the air, with ice and fire as the foundation, and light and earth as assistance. It was undoubtedly a four-element fusion magic. Although individually they were only seventh-tier, when fused together under the principle of mutual generation, this attack surprisingly reached above tenth-tier. Unfortunately, Nian Bing miscalculated this time.\n\nThe power of four century-old Martial Saints unleashing their full strength simultaneously—only those who have truly faced it can understand. Four people, eight palms. The eight streams of combat qi were all condensed to only the thickness of a bowl's rim. But when the eight streams of combat qi struck the combined attack of the four Shadow Puppets, Nian Bing immediately realized something was wrong. The Heaven's Eye Domain could undoubtedly strengthen one's own side while simultaneously weakening the enemy side. However, if the opponent's strength was too great, it was still irresistible. Nian Bing painfully made the fastest reaction: at the instant of the energy collision, he abruptly withdrew the four Shadow Puppets, while he himself flickered more than ten *zhang* away under the effect of the Space Shadow Puppet's possession.\n\nA violent boom made the entire underground plaza tremble. Nian Bing's entire body trembled violently. The aftershocks of the explosion carried his recently appeared body straight out, crashing heavily against a distant stone wall before finally falling to the ground, sending Nian Bing into a daze. The place where he fell was very close to the incense stick. Nian Bing glanced at it; at this point, the incense had only burned down by one-third.\n\nThe full-power attack of four Martial Saints fueled by rage was truly terrifying. Although Nian Bing withdrew them quickly, the four attacking Shadow Puppets had all disappeared. Their Innate Qi was preserved within the hilts of the four divine blades, but restoring them was not something Nian Bing could do at the moment. With the increase in the Shadow Puppets' strength, he would have to spend more time and effort to help them return to their original forms. If he were to summon the Shadow Puppets again with magic now, then it was very likely that the Innate Qi, which had been so painstakingly condensed in the divine blades, would be consumed, and the newly condensed Shadow Puppets would be much weaker in power.\n\nThe most unfortunate one was the Dark Demon Rat. Perhaps it had great speed underground, but in this vast plaza, its mountain-like body couldn't evade anything. Amidst the massive shockwaves, its body was surprisingly completely overturned. Its massive body rolled several times on the ground before stabilizing. A network of wounds crisscrossed its enormous body. Fortunately, it possessed not only dark but also earth attributes, making its defense extremely strong, which was why it didn't end up with its body disintegrated. Despite this, the Dark Demon Rat was still heavily wounded.\n\nJust as Nian Bing had not yet fully recovered, a cyan light flashed. The soft murmur of the Wind of Freedom had also returned before him. The Wind Shadow Puppet had been scattered by the Fifth Elder's sudden burst of powerful magic. Fortunately, its Innate Qi was also preserved at the last moment. Black light glittered; the Shadow Puppet, instead of advancing, retreated with a backward leap, creating an arc in the air as it flew towards Nian Bing. At the same time, the Dark Demon Rat was also recalled into the Soul-Devouring Blade. The moment it had just retreated, the place where it had been was already covered by dark blue flames. It was precisely the Ultimate True Flame!\n\nNian Bing stood up from the ground, continuously chanting a spell. The Sigh of the Ice Goddess, Morning Dew Blade, and the Roar of the Fire God, Righteous Yang Blade, appeared in his left and right hands respectively. Without the Shadow Puppets, he could only rely on his own strength now. The Shadow Puppet stood beside Nian Bing. Its body, conjured from energy, was surprisingly constantly fluctuating at the chest; clearly, it had suffered quite a loss under the Elders' full-power attacks. Its dark energy also had a certain degree of depletion. However, red light reappeared in its eyes. It was the red light of persistence.\n\nThe seven Elders gathered together again, and they also stabilized their auras. Although they had destroyed five of Nian Bing's Shadow Puppets, launching full-power attacks within the Heaven's Eye Domain also consumed a vast amount of their own magical power and combat qi. They realized that Nian Bing was much stronger than they had imagined, especially his strange attack methods, which still left them with lingering fears. The most deeply impressed was the Second Elder. At the last moment, he had already unleashed his full power, launching some special dark magic he had researched with full force. However, the Shadow Puppet seemed to be his nemesis; the dark magical power he released was completely absorbed by the Shadow Puppet. If the Sixth Elder's tenth-tier fire magic hadn't arrived in time, the Second Elder would probably have had his magical power drained by the Shadow Puppet.\n\n\"Good, Innate Domain. I'm starting to believe in Demon Lion's judgment even more now.\" Having suffered a small loss, a look of gratification appeared in the First Elder's eyes instead, while gathering his combat qi and smiling at Nian Bing. Unfortunately, Nian Bing was in no mood to answer him now. The chanting speed of his spell continuously accelerated; red and blue six-pointed stars had already condensed in the air.\n\n\"O, Ice Goddess, grant me the ice of eternal freezing! O, Fire God, grant me the flames of phoenix nirvana! In my name, the limits of ice and fire, fuse!\" Red and blue lights simultaneously rose up. Gradually, amidst Nian Bing's continuously increasing magical power, the original blue light turned bluish-white, while the red light turned into deep blue flames. Nian Bing was very clear that he might not be able to sustain it. Now he could only fight with all his strength; perhaps there was still some chance. Inside his body, the especially bright glows of the five-element small orbs surrounding the Ice and Fire from the Same Source light orb gradually dimmed. Under the effect of mimetic magic, Nian Bing gradually converted their magical power into ice and fire energy.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n*   ¹ *zhang*: A traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or 10 feet.\n*   ² *Innate Qi*: A fundamental energy in many Wuxia/Xianxia settings, representing a practitioner's innate life force or refined spiritual essence.\n*   ³ *Ice and Fire from the Same Source*: A concept or technique implying that despite their opposing natures, ice and fire (or their energies) can originate from the same source or be fused, often leading to enhanced power.",

    "content": "They knew this was their last chance. The seven Elders were all recovering their strength; if they couldn't seize this opportunity to achieve their goal, then they would absolutely never be given another chance to chant spells.\n\nA heavy atmosphere permeated the air. Looking at the dense ice and fire magic elements surrounding Nian Bing, the seven Elders' eyes also revealed solemnity. The four Elders skilled in martial skills stepped forward, and the low chanting of the three Magi continuously echoed. At this moment, Long Tianxiang had already burned down to nearly halfway.\n\nNian Bing didn't use a larger spell. After condensing his ice-fire concordant magic power, he made a bold choice. He knew very well that if it came to pure strength, he might be able to rival any one of the Elders, and with his Innate Domain, dealing with two Elders shouldn't be too big a problem. With the help of the Shadow Puppet, even if three Elders attacked with full force, he could manage. Furthermore, he possessed seven peerless magic blades; relying on their amplification effect on magic, his limit should be to directly contend with four Elders. Although such strength was already astonishing – his current overall power placing him between a Magus and a God-descended Master – he was now indeed facing seven Elders. From their formation, it was clear they were extremely skilled in cooperative techniques. If he were to clash head-on, he feared he wouldn't have a single chance. At present, all he could rely on was his formidable mental power, based on the Heavenly Eye Acupoint. By not controlling the Shadow Puppet, he could mobilize most of his mental power. Therefore, a direct confrontation held no advantage for him; it would be better to…\n\nClusters of light orbs, entangled with red and blue light, gradually appeared around Nian Bing's body. When these orbs first appeared, they were about a foot in diameter, but under Nian Bing's formidable mental compression, they quickly shrank. The light orbs became fist-sized spheres. Due to the extreme use of his mental power, Nian Bing's glabella gradually lit up, soft white light diffusing outwards. A radiant divine glow emanated from Nian Bing's eyes; even the seven Great Elders of the Blood Lion Hall opposite him dared not meet his gaze at that moment.\n\nThe number of light orbs rapidly increased under the amplification of the Heavenly Eye Domain. Hundreds of highly compressed light orbs continuously shimmered in the air, each with an invisible thread of mental power pulling behind it, scattering into the surrounding space under Nian Bing's control.\n\nThe Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God radiated their most intense light in Nian Bing's hands. It was precisely due to their immense energy that Nian Bing was able to condense more magic power in a short time.\n\nThis time, Nian Bing almost completely drained his entire magic power. He intended to use skill to contend with these seven Great Elders to the very end.\n\nLong Tianxiang. When Nian Bing's ice-fire concordant magic projectiles had spread across nearly one-third of the plaza, it finally burned down halfway. Whether it could continue to sustain itself would depend on Nian Bing's control over these magic projectiles.\n\nWith a low shout, the Fifth Elder and Sixth Elder made the first move. The spell unleashed by the Fifth Elder was one Nian Bing was very familiar with: the ninth-tier Fire God's Right Hand. A massive Fire God's Hand stirred up a phantom-like watery shadow in the air. The giant hand's area continuously expanded, heading to directly collide with the large, brightly glowing magic orbs in front of Nian Bing. The Sixth Elder deliberately moved two beats slower than the Fifth Elder. An extremely cold aura spread from the ground—it was the ninth-tier ice magic, Extreme Frost Hell. This spell could generate temperatures below negative ninety degrees Celsius, and if the caster's magic power was sufficient, they could completely control it to achieve a wide-area adhesion effect. The Sixth Elder chose this precisely to cooperate with the Fifth Elder. The reason the Fire God's Right Hand expanded its attack area was to destroy more ice-fire concordant magic projectiles, while the Extreme Frost Hell on the ground would instantly lower the temperature after the projectiles were destroyed, thereby slowing Nian Bing's movements. After all, these were ninth-tier spells; even the Heavenly Eye Domain could only weaken a portion of their attack power.\n\nAfter their previous skirmishes, the seven Elders had gained some understanding of Nian Bing's abilities. The Fifth and Sixth Elders' objective in attacking was singular: to destroy Nian Bing's effective forces and trap him. The ones who would truly defeat Nian Bing would be the four Elders skilled in martial skills. Their design showed they already held Nian Bing in high regard. As Extreme Frost Hell spread, the Great Elder, leading the Third, Fourth, and Seventh Elders, had already soared into the air. Relying on their formidable Holy Battle Qi, they astonishingly floated mid-air, their battle qi radiance completely blazing silver. The silver flames illuminated the entire plaza. As soon as the magic unleashed its proper power, they would undoubtedly launch their attack on Nian Bing at the fastest speed. The Great Elder's target was already locked onto the Shadow Puppet, while the other three Elders had locked onto Nian Bing within his Heavenly Eye Domain.\n\nThe Second Elder, who had expended the most energy earlier, was still there chanting spells. His voice was like a sob, making it impossible to discern what he was chanting, but judging by the gradually intensifying dark aura around his body, this spell was definitely not simple.\n\nThe Fire God's Right Hand expanded to a full ten zhang (approximately 33 meters) in diameter, almost encompassing half of the ice-fire concordant magic projectiles in the air. The Fifth Elder had reached the Magus realm decades ago; he clearly understood the power of compressed magic projectiles, but he was not worried. Precisely because the projectiles' explosive power covered a large area, as long as his Fire God's Right Hand detonated a portion of them, Nian Bing's magic projectiles would likely all be destroyed. However, an unexpected situation occurred.\n\nThe hundreds of ice-fire concordant magic projectiles, condensed with almost all of Nian Bing's magic power, suddenly moved with extreme speed. The projectiles split into two waves, rapidly scattering to the sides, directly clearing the path for the Fire God's Right Hand swooping from above. Four of these projectiles arced like shooting stars chasing the moon*, heading towards the four Elders in the air, while the other projectiles scattered widely like flowers from a celestial maiden*, some flying straight, some diagonally, and some arcing, bypassing the four Elders from a distance and heading straight for the three Magi at the rear.\n\nThe four Elders in the air simultaneously roared and each unleashed a punch, striking at the ice-fire concordant magic orbs rushing towards them. They were not in a hurry; the three Elders behind them were already prepared. Although Nian Bing's magic was powerful, it was impossible for him to defeat the three Magi at the rear relying solely on these magic projectiles. Therefore, their goal was singular: to first defeat Nian Bing.\n\nHowever, the four Elders never expected their highly confident* punches to miss. The Holy Battle Qi they unleashed naturally compressed the surrounding energy. Thus, they weren't afraid of the four magic projectiles changing direction again. But who knew that the four magic projectiles themselves emitted a strange aura? Their innate ice and fire energies actually rubbed together to create an odd magnetic field. Within the constraint of the battle qi, they drifted back, then immediately surged forward again. This time, however, the direction of their surge changed; the four magic projectiles rushed towards a single point. All of this was accomplished in a flash*.\n\nThe battle qi unleashed by the four Elders could not be retracted. Left with no choice, the four could only condense their Holy Battle Qi into protective qi auras. The Great Elder reacted the quickest, his body strangely shifting in mid-air, conjuring countless leg shadows that swept across the sky. Immense battle qi roared forth like a tidal wave, simultaneously carrying intense blue flames. He was a fire-elemental Magic Warrior, and also the strongest among the seven Elders.\n\nAmidst a thunderous roar, the four ice-fire concordant magic projectiles suddenly collided. The instant they impacted, Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye Domain instantly spread, enveloping them, causing the ice and fire auras to surge to another level. Simultaneously, under the effect of the Heavenly Eye Domain, the Fire God's Right Hand, still three zhang (approximately 10 meters) away from Nian Bing, dimmed slightly, and its forward speed also significantly decreased.\n\nThe enormous impact, carrying two completely opposing auras, forcefully knocked the four Martial Saints back over a zhang (approximately 3.3 meters). Although they suffered no injuries, the simultaneous rush of ice and fire auras into their bodies was certainly not pleasant. All four simultaneously used their battle qi to expel the ice and fire auras from their bodies. But in this short time, Nian Bing could accomplish many things.\n\nA black figure suddenly appeared in front of Nian Bing; the Demon-Devouring Blade met the Fire God's Right Hand. It wasn't that Nian Bing didn't want to use spatial magic to escape, but under the shroud of the ninth-tier spell, the surrounding space was already warped. His only possible movement was within the attack range of the Fire God's Right Hand.\n\nThe overly expanded spell, upon colliding with the point-attack of the Demon-Devouring Blade, immediately caused strong fluctuations in the magic elements in the air. A large, over-zhang-long (approximately 3.3+ meters) gash was torn open by the Demon-Devouring Blade. After all, although it was a ninth-tier spell, expanding its attack range too much would significantly weaken its power.\n\nSeizing this opportunity, Nian Bing performed an instant transfer, gracefully escaping the Fire God's Right Hand's attack range. The Shadow Puppet also burst forth with a cloud of black qi, holding the breach, then darted out after Nian Bing. However, the black aura around its body was now much dimmer, clearly due to excessive consumption.\n\nWhile Nian Bing evaded the magic attacks, his control over his magic projectiles did not cease in the slightest. The originally erratically flying magic projectiles immediately changed upon entering within five zhang (approximately 16.5 meters) of the three Magi. Like soldiers under a marshal, they formed three neat columns, continuously accelerating as they rushed towards the three Magi. Pinpoint detonation—this was what Nian Bing intended to do.\n\nA single ice-fire concordant magic projectile was nothing to a Magus-level spellcaster. Even if the projectile was compressed, with its energy dispersed, it would only be equivalent to a fifth or sixth-tier spell. Even the attached ice and fire auras wouldn't significantly affect Magi who inherently cultivated magic. However, if all these spells detonated at a single fixed point, then, regardless of the explosive force, the ice-fire storm they created would absolutely be no weaker than a tenth-tier spell. After all, that was not only Nian Bing's entire magic power but also included the magic energy absorbed by that power in the air! Furthermore, with the amplification from the two divine blades, Sigh of the Ice Goddess and Roar of the Fire God, and the unique properties of their ice-fire concordance, Nian Bing's total magic power would definitely be stronger than that of any of the three Magi individually.\n\nHowever, there was naturally a reason why the Great Elder and the other four Martial Saints were not worried about the three Magi behind them. A century-old Magus was simply incomparable to Nian Bing in terms of combat experience. Facing the incoming ice-fire concordant magic projectiles, although the three Magi were surprised by Nian Bing's exquisite control over magic, they showed no panic. The three quickly retreated together, extending their three hands simultaneously. Amidst flashing light, red, blue, and black three-colored light condensed in the air. The spell the Second Elder had been preparing finally appeared.\n\nThe Fifth Elder and Sixth Elder, relying on their pure magic power, formed a giant shield in the air, blocking in front of the three of them. Before the Second Elder, one after another black figures appeared. These figures were three zhang (approximately 10 meters) tall, mounted on massive warhorses, and each held a five-zhang-long (approximately 16.5 meters) giant spear. There were four of them in total, arrayed horizontally in front of the three Elders.\n\nNian Bing exclaimed in shock, \"Dark Summoning: Ultimate Dark Knights!\" Of course, he knew this spell; it was clearly an eleventh-tier dark forbidden spell! With his own abilities, he was utterly incapable of casting such a powerful forbidden spell, yet it unexpectedly appeared in the hands of the Second Elder, who had already expended a significant amount of magic power and was not using any magical item assistance.\n\nThree streams of ice-fire concordant magic orbs converged, striking the barrier jointly set up by the Fifth and Sixth Elders from three different directions. Intense roars continuously echoed. Under Nian Bing's deliberate control, the ice-fire concordant magic orbs produced a certain superimposed attack effect. After one-third of the magic orbs had struck, the barrier was already on the verge of collapse.\n\nJust then, the four tall Ultimate Dark Knights made their move. Four five-zhang-long (approximately 16.5 meters) knight spears simultaneously thrust out, instantly piercing four magic orbs. The four long spears continuously flashed, transforming into a blur of spear shadows. The power of a forbidden spell was terrifying; they gave the magic orbs no chance to detonate in conjunction. The four Ultimate Dark Knights surged forward, and amidst the spear shadows, the magic orbs, condensed with all of Nian Bing's magic power, dwindled one by one. Although Nian Bing's control was exquisite, these four Dark Knights were simply too powerful. Not only were their attacks formidable, but their speed was also like lightning. It was too late for the magic orbs to escape.\n\nAt this moment, the Great Elder, leading the other three Elders, also launched a storm-like* attack on Nian Bing. Battle qi crisscrossed the air, and streaks of battle qi radiance continuously pursued the flickering Nian Bing, preventing him from having excessive mental power to control his magic. Left with no choice, Nian Bing could only issue his final command to his magic orbs: simultaneous detonation.\n\nThe air seemed to halt at this instant. The four Elders who were originally attacking Nian Bing simultaneously channeled their protective battle qi to its strongest. Four silver light clusters scattered, and the entire underground plaza was plunged into an ice-fire hell. The ninth-tier spell originally released by the Fifth Elder was completely engulfed in this ice-fire hell. The temperature in the air alternated, fluctuating between hot and cold. A violent energy storm swept out. The barrier jointly activated by the Fifth and Sixth Elders was shattered. The Second, Fifth, and Sixth Elders were encircled by the dark aura formed by the Ultimate Dark Knights, protecting the three Magi. The forbidden spell unleashed by the Second Elder was not a single-burst powerful forbidden spell, but the four summoned Ultimate Dark Knights were equivalent to four powerful Dark Martial Saints. Although their duration was limited, the destructive power they could unleash in a short time was immense. While the eruption of the ice-fire hell temporarily stalled the four Dark Knights, once they were able to unleash their full power, even four true Martial Saints would only be able to defend against them. Nian Bing was actually quite helpless. If he hadn't seen the summoning of the Ultimate Dark Knights and been cornered by the Great Elder and the other three, he would not have chosen to completely detonate his magic power. He knew very well that once the burst of energy passed, if the three Magi freed their hands to join the Great Elder and the other three in dealing with him, who would have lost most of his magic power, he would have no chance of survival. However, at that moment, he had no choice.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\\* **shooting stars chasing the moon**: An idiom describing extreme speed.\n\\* **flowers from a celestial maiden**: An idiom describing something spreading out widely and beautifully.\n\\* **highly confident**: Original Chinese idiom literally means \"ten parts grasped, nine parts steady,\" implying great certainty.\n\\* **in a flash**: Original Chinese idiom literally means \"in an instant of electric light and fire,\" conveying extreme speed.\n\\* **storm-like**: Original Chinese idiom literally means \"like a fierce wind and torrential rain,\" conveying an intense and overwhelming attack.",

    "title": "Chapter 143: Soul Transfer·Oscar's Attack (Part 1)",
    "content": "The battle qi unleashed by the Grand Elder and the other three wove into a vast net in the air. Even with the assistance of the spatial Shadow Puppet and the Dark Shadow Puppet, Nian Bing's available space to dodge grew smaller and smaller. Once he clashed head-on with any elder's battle qi, a heavy blow was inevitable, so he had no choice but to make this selection.\n\nThe Ice-Fire Hell generated by the violent explosion also affected Nian Bing. His protective Heavenly Eye Domain had become extremely weak due to lack of magic power support. The powerful impact force once again pushed him to the edge of the stone wall. Waves of weakness surged through him. Although he still had some mental power left, without magic power support, he was already at his wit's end*. The seven-element Shadow Puppets were broken for the first time, and even his strongest magic had not caused real harm to the seven elders. Now, unless he used the Life Curse, he truly had nothing left to resist the elders' attacks. But in such a test, how could he use a Life Curse that would harm himself? Gasping for air, Nian Bing resisted the impact of the Ice-Fire Hell's energy with his Heavenly Eye Domain and powerful body, continuously thinking about what he should do next. At this moment, Long Tianxiang, burning in the corner, was not affected by the Ice-Fire Hell, and one-third of the incense body was still burning.\n\n\"Boss, can you do it? If not, let me try,\" Oscar's lazy voice echoed in Nian Bing's mind. The gray qi flow in his chest stirred restlessly. His voice immediately jolted Nian Bing awake from his thoughts, and he asked hesitantly, \"Can you? These elders outside are stronger than the last!\" Although Oscar was a descendant of the Dragon King, he had, after all, only hatched a short time ago.\n\nOscar chuckled, saying, \"Fighting head-on certainly won't work, but if I use this body, I'll be stronger than you, right? You don't have much magic power left, so go rest for a bit. Watch your brother do this. Anyway, there's not much time left, just gotta get through it.\" He and Nian Bing were one, their souls connected. When Nian Bing first began fighting the seven elders, he had already woken up. Through their soul connection, he naturally knew what was happening in this battle. Nian Bing could no longer hold on, so Oscar proposed that he continue to handle the upcoming trial.\n\nNian Bing now had no other choice. With a nod, he reined in his mental power, gathered his soul into the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, and relinquished control of his body. Oscar had not controlled this body for some time. When he took over control of the body again, a golden light appeared in Nian Bing's originally azure eyes. The innate domain protecting his body was replaced by a faint layer of gray qi flow, within which a faint golden light shimmered. Although without the protection of the Heavenly Eye Domain, the residual energy of the Ice-Fire Domain could not harm him in the slightest. Oscar stretched his body, letting out an exaggerated roar, \"Dragon God's Incarnation!\" His intelligence had awakened, so he naturally understood that others couldn't know he shared a body with Nian Bing. This exaggerated roar was precisely to conceal the truth.\n\nGray scales gradually grew out from his skin. The faint gray scales shimmered with a weak light. The scales were fine and dense, and no significant change was visible from the surface, but Oscar had already increased the overall defense of this body by several times compared to before. His entire skeletal structure crackled. His body, full of explosive power, sprang up. With a flash, he directly pounced on the Seventh Elder, who had retreated to the side to avoid the Ice-Fire Hell. You always pick the softest persimmon to squeeze**. Regardless of rank or true strength, the Seventh Elder was the weakest among the Blood Lion Hall elders.\n\nAt this moment, all seven elders had struggled out of the Ice-Fire Hell. Just as they were about to continue attacking Nian Bing, they clearly saw Nian Bing's lightning-fast body pouncing on the Seventh Elder.\n\nThe Seventh Elder was stunned for a moment. Nian Bing had previously used only magic, so why was he suddenly attacking him directly? Although Nian Bing's approach was fast, it had no frills. A punch thrown with speed didn't look like it had much power. Without time to think, the Seventh Elder spun around and unleashed three thunderous palms, meeting Oscar's attack. The instant their battle qi made contact, the Seventh Elder was suddenly surprised to feel that the gray battle qi released by the opponent was full of stickiness. More than half of his own unleashed battle qi felt like it was hitting rubber, completely absorbed without any force. Just then, Oscar had already closed in on him, punching toward the Seventh Elder's right chest. Oscar's speed was already no less than that of the Shadow Puppet within the Heavenly Eye Domain.\n\nThe Seventh Elder's combat experience was extremely rich. When unable to dodge, he lightly struck out with a palm, attacking where the enemy must defend, which was his best choice at this moment. Unfortunately, his judgment was wrong. Oscar seemed to not have seen his attack at all, and his speed increased by a few points. The Seventh Elder's launched palm had only moved halfway, and its battle qi hadn't fully erupted when it already struck Oscar's body. In an instant, the Seventh Elder clearly felt Oscar's body tremble slightly, actually deflecting thirty percent of his attack's energy. His body was as hard as steel, emitting a muffled \"thump.\" At the same time, Oscar's right fist had already slammed into the Seventh Elder's body. The silver holy battle qi, reacting to the Seventh Elder, reached its limit. Unfortunately, in Oscar's punch, the energy rapidly spun, forcibly breaking through seventy percent of his battle qi, and precisely striking his right chest. The Seventh Elder opened his mouth and spurted a mouthful of fresh blood, his body sent flying straight out. Fortunately, he was well-versed in the method of deflecting force, so he did not suffer a fatal injury from Oscar's strike. Despite this, an extremely strange energy had invaded his meridians. That energy was very strange; it didn't destroy his body but continuously devoured the battle qi within him. This made the Seventh Elder completely unable to control his momentum, causing him to crash into a distant wall and slowly slide to the ground. At this moment, he didn't even dare to move, enduring the pain radiating from his body, and fully channeling his battle qi to contend with the strange energy that Oscar had instilled into him. One of the seven elders lost his ability to attack under Oscar's sudden sneak attack.\n\nOscar didn't find the Seventh Elder's palm easy to deal with either. Although that palm looked light and much of its force was deflected, it still made Oscar grimace. While the holy battle qi couldn't break his dragon body's defense, the pain was still there. He didn't pursue the Seventh Elder. His body leaped into the air, miraculously changing direction instantly without needing solid ground, flying diagonally to the side, dodging the combined attack of the Grand Elder, Second Elder, and Fourth Elder. At this moment, the four Ultimate Dark Knights summoned by the Second Elder still rushed forward, locking onto Oscar with angry roars.\n\nOscar, who had originally been full of confidence, now understood how powerful the seven elders Nian Bing had faced earlier truly were. His confidence from when he had just taken over the body had been greatly shaken. Just as he was hesitating about which direction to burst out from, the Dark Shadow Puppet, which had remained motionless after Oscar took over the body, suddenly moved. The spatial Shadow Puppet had disappeared because Nian Bing had relinquished control of the body, but the Dark Shadow Puppet had remained stagnant there. Oscar had thought it had also lost its combat ability, but the Dark Shadow Puppet's sudden movement startled him, because the Dark Shadow Puppet's target was actually those four powerful Dark Knights.\n\nWhat surprised everyone even more was this: When the Dark Shadow Puppet rushed into the midst of the four Dark Knights, the four Dark Knights' huge bodies actually trembled. A dark purple and black light emanated from within the Dark Shadow Puppet, instantly enveloping the huge bodies of the four Dark Knights. Not only did the Dark Knights not launch an attack, but under the shroud of the dark purple light, their bodies actually trembled slightly, as if they were afraid of something. Just then, the Demon-Devouring Blade in the Dark Shadow Puppet's hand was raised, and a sharp whistling sound emanated from its mouth. The bodies of the four Dark Knights instantly vanished, transforming into vast dark energy, frantically surging into the Dark Shadow Puppet's already somewhat dim body. Under the effect of the immense energy, the Dark Shadow Puppet not only returned to its peak state, but now it no longer looked like an illusion but a physical entity. A physical entity exactly like Nian Bing's appearance, completely enveloped in a robe condensed from dark energy. Dark red light emanated from its eyes, and a powerful aura filled with oppressive force. Streaks of black lightning continuously flashed and flowed into the black gem on the hilt of the Demon-Devouring Blade.\n\nOscar couldn't afford to admire the Dark Shadow Puppet's transformation, because the Grand Elder and the other two had already closed in. His speed was fast, but the three elders' combined attack ability was extremely powerful, directly blocking all his escape routes. Left with no choice, Oscar could only exchange blows with each of the three elders. His technique was far inferior to the three elders; he relied solely on speed and his powerful body. The strange gray energy helped him greatly. Amidst violent roars, he fought and retreated, directly enduring dozens of palms from the three elders. Although his body was extremely powerful, Oscar already felt his qi and blood churning uncomfortably as if boiling within him. He opened his mouth and spurted a mist of blood, then roared, \"Dragon Domain!\" The golden light that had been faintly visible within the gray aura instantly became clear, and a ring of golden halo drifted out. Oscar let out a deafening dragon roar skyward. The scales on his body visibly thickened significantly. A golden light burst forth from his eyes, and the scales on his hands turned a dazzling gold. His body vibrated, and countless fist shadows met the elders' continuous attacks. Under the immense external pressure, Oscar had no choice but to use a special attack from the first layer of the Dragon God's Heart Art. Although his power had already cultivated to the first layer, using this Dragon God Power consumed a large amount of his energy. But the Dragon God's Heart Art was, after all, a top-tier cultivation technique that only Dragon Gods could cultivate. The appearance of the Dragon Domain instantly elevated Oscar's strength to a new realm. He unleashed three punches—*boom*, *boom*, *boom*—and actually managed to forcibly send the three elders flying backward. The scales protecting his body flushed red, which was a reaction to his dragon power being used to its limit. This was Oscar's first time fighting against others, and his experience was not rich. He didn't pursue the three elders. With a flash, he retreated to the Dark Shadow Puppet's side. At this moment, the Dragon Domain he had used with all his might vanished just like that. The scales on his hands returned to gray. Oscar gasped for air, cursing inwardly, \"Damn it, if only I could evolve to the second stage of the dragon race, or cultivate the Dragon God's Heart Art to the third layer, why would I be afraid of these old geezers? Crap, my dragon power is consumed too quickly!\"\n\nThe Dark Shadow Puppet shifted sideways, blocking in front of Oscar. It didn't even look at the positions of the seven elders. The Demon-Devouring Blade in its hand spewed out blade aura over ten feet long, rapidly drawing several arcs in the air, blasting away the magic of the Second Elder, Fifth Elder, and Sixth Elder. At this moment, the Grand Elder and the other two had already charged up again. Oscar wasn't feeling well, and neither were they. Under the effect of the Dragon Domain, the three punches Oscar had just unleashed against them were filled with powerful shock force, making the meridians within the three elders' bodies feel like they were burning. But seeing that Long Tianxiang was about to burn out, they couldn't spare time to regulate their own energy.\n\nThe Second Elder was already too weak to launch any more magic attacks. Of course, the Dark Shadow Puppet's ability to dispel all dark magic also made him somewhat apprehensive. The forbidden spell he had used with all his might had actually turned into the opponent's energy; such a feeling would probably be unbearable for anyone. Although the Fifth Elder and Sixth Elder intended to use stronger magic, the burning state of Long Tianxiang no longer allowed them enough time to chant the incantations required for forbidden spells. Therefore, at this moment, they could only continuously unleash fifth and sixth-tier magic to harass the Dark Shadow Puppet. However, the Dark Shadow Puppet, after absorbing the energy of the four Dark Knights, had become exceptionally powerful. It just stood there in front of Oscar, cleaving out one strike after another. Each strike carried a massive energy flow, not only meeting the fierce frontal attacks from the Grand Elder and the other two, but occasionally, a single cleave could also easily neutralize the magic of the Fifth Elder and Sixth Elder.\n\nNian Bing and Oscar switched roles again. When Nian Bing regained control of his body, he was so angry he almost spat blood. His body was constantly sending intense pain signals due to the previous immense energy impacts. Fortunately, Oscar's dragon power had completely transformed his body; otherwise, after successively enduring attacks from four Martial Saint-level elders, his body would probably have long since collapsed.\n\n---\n*   **at his wit's end**: The original Chinese idiom 山窮水盡 (shān qióng shuǐ jìn) literally means \"mountains exhausted, rivers run dry,\" implying being at the end of one's resources or options.\n**   **You always pick the softest persimmon to squeeze**: The original Chinese idiom 柿子，總是要揀軟的來捏 (shìzi, zǒng shì yào jiǎn ruǎn de lái niē) literally means \"persimmons, always pick the soft ones to squeeze,\" signifying picking on the weakest or easiest target.",

    "content": "What Nian Bing didn't know was that even among Martial Saints, there were differences in strength. Although these seven elders, due to their advanced age, could no longer break through the realms of Magician and Martial Saint to reach higher levels, they had all reached the pinnacle of Martial Saint and Magician. Especially the Great Elder, who brought forth a fire dragon with every palm strike; not only was he a Martial Saint, but the fire attribute technique attached to his battle qi was also on par with a Magician's strength. If Nian Bing hadn't used guerrilla tactics to contend with these seven elders, combined with his miraculous Heaven's Eye Domain and All-Elemental Shadow Puppets, he might not have been a match for the Great Elder alone. Earlier, he had overestimated himself somewhat. How could the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion Hall be ordinary individuals?\n\nAt this moment, the Shadow Puppet could be said to be the eye of the storm. Hiding behind the storm's center, Nian Bing carefully observed the body that seemed to be completely identical to his own. The Demon-Devouring Blade was unleashed in the Shadow Puppet's hands, and with every blade aura it cleaved, its energy instantly magnified. Nian Bing clearly felt the Shadow Puppet's energy rapidly depleting, yet it showed no intention of retreating, clashing almost frantically with the six elders, one strike after another. A strange feeling suddenly arose in Nian Bing's heart, as if the Shadow Puppet before him was no longer a mass of energy, but a person, a real person.\n\nJust as the Shadow Puppet cleaved open the Great Elder's red battle qi, which carried a fire dragon, the elders' attacks ceased. The Shadow Puppet's body trembled slightly, but it still stood there stubbornly. At this point, Nian Bing clearly felt that he had regained control over the Shadow Puppet. Glancing at Long Tianxiang by the distant wall, Nian Bing put the Shadow Puppet and the Demon-Devouring Blade back into his Spatial Ring. Although he looked a bit disheveled, his heart was incomparably joyful. Because, during the Shadow Puppet's final resistance, Long Tianxiang had finally burned out.\n\nNot only was Nian Bing gasping for breath, but the elders' breathing was also unsteady. The Great Elder looked at Nian Bing with a strange gaze. \"Nian Bing, how old are you this year?\"\n\nNian Bing honestly replied, \"Around twenty years old. Great Elder. I should have passed the test, right?\" He asked tentatively, knowing that if the Great Elder's answer was affirmative, it would prove that he had become the true Sect Master of the Blood Lion Sect, gaining complete control over all its power.\n\nThe Great Elder's gaze swept over the other elders. The Fifth and Sixth Elders had already helped the Second Elder, who had exhausted too much magic power, over. And the Seventh Elder had finally dispelled the half-formed energy Oscar had injected into his body. Of course, the price was heavy; over sixty percent of the battle qi in his body had been dissolved by Oscar's strange energy, and he wouldn't recover for at least a day or two.\n\nThe seven elders stood in a row before Nian Bing. Just as Nian Bing felt a little uneasy, the seven elders simultaneously knelt on one knee, respectfully saying, \"The Seven Elders of the Blood Lion Sect greet Sect Master Bai.\"\n\nNian Bing was startled, then overjoyed. He had finally gained control over the strongest underground force on the entire Yangguang Continent. He quickly stepped forward, helped the Great Elder up, and respectfully said, \"Great-Grandpa, and all you Great-Uncles, please rise quickly. How can I accept your courtesy? From now on, you don't need to bow to me anytime.\"\n\nThe Great Elder looked deeply at Nian Bing, a look of relief in his eyes. \"To be frank, I truly don't understand how you did it. When I was twenty, I was merely a Martial Warrior, and even then, I was considered the most outstanding talent in the entire Rong family. And you, like me, walk the path of magic and martial arts, but your strength is already no less than mine now. Moreover, you even possess an Innate Domain and can summon special creatures to assist your attacks. I've lived to such an old age, yet this is the first time I've seen abilities like yours. Demon Lion was right; a young man like you is more suited to sit in the position of Blood Lion Sect Master than he was. It seems the future of our Blood Lion Sect will become even brighter. Nian Bing, oh, no, I should call you Bai. The Sect Master of this sect never uses his real name. From now on, as long as we seven old fellows are still alive, we will support you without reservation. Whatever you want to do, do it boldly. Our Blood Lion Sect has been hidden underground for many years, it's time to become active.\"\n\nThe Second Elder suddenly spoke, \"Kid, what exactly is that black shadow of yours? It seems to be the bane of darkness by nature, yet it itself belongs to darkness.\" He hadn't suffered a loss for who knows how many years. The Second Elder's overall strength was second only to the Great Elder among the seven elders, but he was the one who suffered the most setbacks today. He had used several powerful dark magic spells, but not only did they have no effect, he was almost completely devoured of his magic power by the Shadow Puppet. Although he now acknowledged Nian Bing as the new Sect Master, he couldn't help but feel a surge of anger recalling his earlier helplessness.\n\nThe Seventh Elder stepped forward, pinching Nian Bing's arm, and also said peevishly, \"Kid, what was that battle qi of yours just now? It was so strange, you almost killed me.\"\n\nNian Bing gave a bitter smile, \"Elders, truthfully, sometimes even I don't fully understand how strong I am. In fact, at most, I can only compare to one of you. But I was quite lucky and obtained seven Magic Divine Blades. They are all top-tier divine blades. Both the Innate Domain you just witnessed and those seven Shadow Puppets were cultivated based on these seven blades.\"\n\nThe Second Elder's eyes widened. \"What did you say? What you used just now was merely a seventh-tier puppet technique? Kid, are you trying to infuriate me to death? You should know, my Ultimate Dark Knight Summoning is only second to Hell Demon Dragon Summoning in the Dark Magic Puppet series. A mere small puppet technique of yours destroyed one of my forbidden spells? I've practiced dark magic for so many years for nothing!\"\n\nNian Bing quickly forced a smile apologetically, \"Second Elder, please don't be angry! Didn't I just say, my puppet technique is based on magic blades, and furthermore, you should have already discovered that I cultivate all-elemental magic. Therefore, my magic undergoes many variations. Sometimes, even I don't understand some of the mutated situations of my magic.\"\n\nThe Great Elder smiled slightly. \"A genius all-elemental magician! I never expected such a talent to emerge from the current fourth generation of our Rong family. Good, very good. Let's go out. Now, you can take charge of all matters within the sect. It's also time for us to discuss your Heaven-Changing Operation plan. Nian Bing, if you have any questions, you can ask us. We will assist you in your role as Sect Master.\"\n\nReturning to the ground. Nian Bing's body felt much more comfortable. His Innate Qi allowed his magic power to recover much faster than ordinary magicians, and his body, modified by Oscar's Dragon Soul, also had extremely strong recovery abilities; the pain in his body had lessened considerably. However, the Second and Seventh Elders' complexions were not so good. After all, they were over a hundred years old. Although powerful, they could no longer compare to young people. Yindang had been waiting outside the rockery all along. Seeing Nian Bing, though a bit disheveled, emerge completely unharmed, he couldn't help but stare in surprise, his mouth hanging open. He didn't dare ask too many questions and quickly led Nian Bing and the seven elders back to the meeting hall.\n\nThe seven elders took their seats one after another. The Second Elder and Seventh Elder closed their eyes to rest. They were indeed a bit tired. The Great Elder pulled out a golden lion from his怀 and handed it to Yindang, stating solemnly, \"By the order of the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion Hall, effective today, the Sect Master of this sect shall be formally succeeded by Acting Sect Master Bai. All members of our Blood Lion Sect, high and low, must completely obey all Sect Master's orders. Those who disobey shall be executed without mercy.\"\n\nAlthough Yindang had a premonition, upon truly receiving the Great Elder's command, his eyes couldn't help but widen. He stared at Nian Bing, who looked somewhat disheveled, and for a moment was stunned.\n\nThe Great Elder frowned slightly and said, \"What? Do I need to repeat the command?\"\n\nOnly then did Yindang react. Nian Bing had actually passed the seven elders' extreme test! Heavens! Had the world truly changed? He looked barely twenty years old, how was it possible? Could he have cultivated for many years and then reverted to youth? Hmm, it must be, his hair was all white. Not daring to delay further, he took the golden lion from the Great Elder's hand and hurried out to execute the order.\n\nThe Great Elder turned to Nian Bing and said, \"Now, we can discuss the specific plan. I'd like to hear how you intend to proceed. If I'm not mistaken, you should already have a general plan.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"This plan is very important to our sect, so first and foremost, we must be cautious. Secondly, this operation must be fast. Only by achieving our goal with lightning speed can we succeed. The most important aspect of the operation is intelligence. I now need all intelligence regarding the political situation of the entire Ice Moon Empire, especially the current status of the princes, the distribution of their power, and all information about them.\"\n\nThe Great Elder smiled slightly. \"Intelligence has always been the most important thing to our Blood Lion Sect. Whatever you want to know, just ask us directly. Because the Blood Lion Hall serves as the intelligence center within our sect. We old fellows should be clear about what you want to know. The Ice Moon Empire's affairs have always been handled by the Third Elder. You can ask your questions now.\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment and said, \"First, I'd like to know how many officials in the Ice Moon Empire are under our control.\"\n\nThe Third Elder's eyes lit up, and he smiled. \"That's a good question. It seems you've already thought of something. That's right, not only in the Ice Moon Empire, but in all five great empires, we have officials under our control, and many of them are high-ranking officials. Currently, in the Ice Moon Empire, we control over twenty officials. Three of them hold significant power: two are from the military, and the other is Suderling, the Finance Minister of the Ice Moon Empire. Suderling himself is a member of our Blood Lion Sect, and he is also the Deputy Hall Master of the Ice Moon Hall. We had once considered secretly controlling the politics of the Ice Moon Empire, so he is currently affiliated with the Fifth Prince, who has the most hope of inheriting the throne. As for the other two high-ranking military officials, they currently maintain a neutral stance. We originally planned to let them make their decision after the Ice Moon Empire's succession was finally determined, but it seems the plan needs to change now.\"\n\nNian Bing asked, \"Who are these two individuals? And how much of a role can they play?\"\n\nThe Third Elder smiled slightly. \"The first person, although his official position is not very high, is deeply trusted by the current King of the Ice Moon Empire. He is Nusar, the Earl and City Governor of Ice Moon City, commanding all fifty thousand Ice Moon Guard Corps of the outer city.\"\n\n\"What?\" Nian Bing cried out in surprise. The Blood Lion Hall controlled such an important figure! His plan, which he had not been entirely confident in, now seemed almost certainly achievable, with a ninety percent chance of success after hearing this news.\n\nThe Third Elder said, \"However, although he commands a considerable military force and is responsible for all city defense affairs of Ice Moon City, he only controls the forces of the outer city. Within Ice Moon City, the largest power is the Royal Guard Corps, directly under the king. Although they number only ten thousand, every one of them is a master. Furthermore, there are many high-level magicians from the Ice God Tower in the palace, as well as a large number of masters recruited by the king. Even if the Ice Moon Guard Corps suddenly mutinied, they couldn't pose any threat to the palace. And this force within the palace is beyond our control, so a direct military coup is absolutely impossible. As for the other high-ranking military official we control, he has no military authority within the city. Whomever he aligns with can only exert a certain deterrent effect.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"I never intended a military coup; that would be an inferior strategy. If I'm not mistaken, the Royal Guard Corps should only obey the king's commands. Whomever the king ultimately decides to pass the throne to, they will pledge their allegiance to that person, right?\"\n\nThe Third Elder nodded, looking at Nian Bing approvingly. \"That's right, precisely so.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Then, could you tell me about the power distribution of the various princes now?\"\n\nThe Third Elder replied, \"Of course. Currently, the First Prince and Second Prince were both born to the Queen. So, although these two brothers are also engaging in overt and covert struggles, when their common enemy, the Fifth Prince, rose, they united to oppose him. Many of the Queen's direct relatives are high-ranking court officials in the Ice Moon Empire. Coupled with the proper order of seniority, the First and Second Princes originally had the largest forces. However, it must be said that the Fifth Prince possesses extraordinary talent. In just a few years, he has successively won over many important court officials to his side. We recently received new intelligence that he has officially gained the support of the rapidly rising Ice Moon Empire Magicians' Guild. Overall, the forces currently controlled by the Fifth Prince are no longer inferior to those of the First and Second Princes. As for the other princes, they are all incompetent individuals. The Third, Fourth, and Sixth Princes mostly only know how to enjoy themselves and have not achieved much. They only wish to be carefree princes, so they are waiting for whichever of their brothers ascends the throne to enfeoff them as kings and dispatch them to other places. As for the Seventh Prince you mentioned, frankly, I don't have high hopes for him. He has always been very low-key, and although he doesn't crave luxurious enjoyment, his peculiar interest is hard to accept. Even the current king rarely pays attention to him, so among all seven princes, his forces are the weakest.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing smiled slightly, saying, \"Precisely because his influence is the smallest, he will attract the least attention. Therefore, we will choose him as the successor to the Ice Moon Empire this time. Third Elder, I want to use the Blood Lion Sect's network to meet him first. This Seventh Prince, Yan Feng, indeed has no fondness for politics whatsoever, and I must communicate with him. At the same time, constantly pay attention to when the Fifth Prince returns to Ice Moon City from Ice Snow City; only then can we act.\"\n\nNian Bing paused, thought carefully for a moment, and after discussing with the seven elders, immediately issued several orders. Only then did he quietly leave the Warrior Guild and return to the inn.\n\nFighting the seven elders had left Nian Bing very tired, but after only an hour of rest, it was already evening. Dragging his somewhat recovered body, he returned to Xue Po's Marshal's Manor, continuing his daily work of preparing dinner.\n\nAs soon as he entered the Marshal's Manor, Nian Bing ran directly into Xue Po's daughter, Xue Yu. The moment Xue Yu saw Nian Bing, she didn't shy away, pulling him and saying, \"Nian Bing! Where have you been? I've been so worried looking for you, I was about to die of anxiety! Why are you back so late?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, saying, \"What is it, Young Miss? Is there something you need me for? Don't worry, I won't delay dinner.\"\n\nXue Yu pulled Nian Bing towards the kitchen, saying, \"You don't know, we have distinguished guests in the manor today. Father told you to prepare a more lavish dinner banquet, and it needs to have some special characteristics. Make it for ten people. Hurry, hurry, the guests might be arriving soon.\"\n\nNian Bing asked in surprise, \"Young Miss, what kind of guests could make you so nervous?\"\n\nXue Yu said, \"It's not me who's nervous, it's Father who's nervous. I haven't seen him this nervous in a long time. From the look of it, today's guests must be extraordinary! Father is already changing his clothes. I heard Mother say that Father is going to personally greet the distinguished guests at the entrance of the Marshal's Manor.\"\n\nA cold sweat broke out on Nian Bing's back. He couldn't help but secretly wonder who today's guests could be. Blood-Devouring Soul-Destroyer Xue Po, always looked down on others, and was a notoriously iron-blooded marshal. Was it the King of the Ice Moon Empire himself? No, that's not right! Given Xue Po's personality, even if the King came, he wouldn't be this nervous, let alone that the King is currently gravely ill, so how could he suddenly come to this Marshal's Manor?\n\nStill puzzled, Nian Bing was already dragged to the kitchen by Xue Yu. Xue Yu giggled and said, \"Nian Bing, you cook so well, let me watch you cook today, okay?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Are you supervising me, or do you want to become my disciple?\" Xue Yu's personality was very different from Xue Jing's; she had no pampered young miss's temper whatsoever. Compared to Long Ling's gentleness, she was more lively. Although Nian Bing had only been in the manor for a few days, he was already very familiar with her, like ordinary friends. After dinner in the evenings, Xue Yu would always ask Nian Bing questions about food and diet.\n\nXue Yu laughed, \"I want to become your disciple, I just don't know if you're willing to accept me.\"\n\nNian Bing laughed, \"Let's forget it. I'm afraid Marshal would kill me. I'm still young. I still want to marry a wife and have children.\"\n\nXue Yu's pretty face flushed. \"You're annoying! I knew you wouldn't agree. But, I'm a girl. I often hear people say that to tie down a man's heart, you must first tie down his stomach. I want to learn some cooking skills from you so that when I get married in the future, I can be a good wife and loving mother!\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Xue Yu's slightly shy expression and thought to himself, *She really is a good girl. I wonder who will be lucky enough to marry her in the future; that person will surely be very happy.* Thinking this, he couldn't help but nod at Xue Yu.\n\nXue Yu was overjoyed. \"Nian Bing, are you really willing to teach me cooking skills?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"Why not? I will certainly fulfill your wish. I just wonder who will be so lucky in the future as to marry our Young Miss Xue Yu!\"\n\nXue Yu's pretty face turned even redder. She shyly lowered her head and said, \"Stop it, don't make fun of me. So, from now on, should I call you Master?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"No need for that. If you're willing, just call me 'Big Brother'. I'll accept you as my little sister. From now on, if anyone dares to bully you, your Big Brother will stand up for you.\" He felt a strong fondness for Xue Yu in his heart, but not the slightest romantic affection. Just like Mao Mao, he completely regarded Xue Yu as a younger sister.\n\nXue Yu clapped her hands and laughed, \"Great! Father only has me as a daughter, and I've always wanted an older brother who could protect me.\"\n\nNian Bing saw her happy expression, and a warmth spread through his heart. He smiled slightly, \"You are a young miss, and I am just a cook. It is I who am elevating myself by becoming your brother.\"\n\nXue Yu pouted her small mouth and said, \"What 'elevating oneself' or 'lowering oneself'? I think you're great! All that stuff about status is annoying to think about. I've decided you're my Big Brother, so you are my Big Brother.\"\n\nNian Bing took a step forward, lowered his head, and said, \"Then tell your Big Brother, who is your beloved? Don't tell me you don't have one, I won't believe it. When I just said that, your eyes were filled with longing, and your heart was beating very fast. Clearly, you already have someone in mind. Perhaps I can even help you with something.\"\n\n\"You're annoying! You just became my Big Brother, and you're already teasing me. Actually, actually, I know he and I are impossible.\" As she spoke, she sadly lowered her head.\n\nNian Bing was startled. Seeing Xue Yu's forlorn expression, he couldn't help but press, \"What? Has this person already started a family?\"\n\nXue Yu shook her head and said, \"No, but I know he won't like me. Not now, and not ever.\"\n\nNian Bing didn't ask further, because he didn't want to see Xue Yu upset. He patted her shoulder and smiled slightly, \"Didn't you want to learn cooking skills? Alright, let's start today. Today, Big Brother will show you what true culinary art looks like. Xiao Yu, I assume you've studied martial arts, right?\"\n\nXue Yu nodded and said, \"I've learned a bit from Father, but my talent isn't good, and I don't really try hard. My current level is very ordinary, far worse than Sister Xue Jing.\"\n\nNian Bing thought to himself, *Your Sister Xue Jing has now taken the Dragon King as her master, so she'll probably be even further ahead in the future.* He then said, \"With a certain foundation in martial arts, you'll find learning culinary skills much easier. Today, just observe, then carefully recall my movements. The foundation of culinary art is rationality. Any food inherently has its rationality; if you can reasonably implement and connect it, then your cooking skills can at least reach the level of an ordinary chef. But to advance to a higher realm, you can only rely on your continuous efforts.\"\n\nWatching Nian Bing's serious expression, Xue Yu said in surprise, \"Big Brother, do culinary skills and martial arts have some kind of connection?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Of course. In fact, all arts and crafts are interconnected and can draw inspiration from each other. Do you know why the dishes I make are very special? Because it's no longer just ordinary cooking. Come in with me, and you'll understand after you see my method of preparation.\" Ever since his culinary skills were recognized by Xue Po, Nian Bing had always cooked in a separate area, not wanting too many people to see him use magic during the cooking process. But today was an exception.\n\nWhen Nian Bing carried trays of dishes to the living room, Xue Yu was still standing in the kitchen he had used earlier for cooking. She stood there blankly, her big eyes unblinking, staring at the various kitchen utensils and ingredients on the stove. Everything Nian Bing had done earlier had brought her too great a shock; she never, ever imagined that such culinary art existed in the world. Recalling the splendid scene, her heart was deeply shaken. She never, ever thought that Nian Bing's culinary skills could be so miraculous.\n\nNian Bing made a total of sixteen dishes: six cold and ten hot. In addition, there was a fragrant pot of pigeon rice. Although it took a considerable amount of time, these were all his specialties. When he, dressed in the Marshal's Manor's servant's clothes, went to the living room to deliver the last dish of pigeon rice, the originally empty living room was already filled with people.\n\nXue Po and his wife were respectfully pouring tea. There were seven guests sitting in the living room. When Nian Bing carried the food in, he saw them, and they also saw Nian Bing at the same time. Both sides were stunned, because Nian Bing realized that the seven guests who had arrived today were none other than the Blood Lion Seven Elders, with whom he had only recently parted ways. The Blood Lion Seven Elders were even more astonished that Nian Bing, who had just succeeded as the Sect Master, was serving food in servant's clothes within Xue Po's manor.\n\nHearing footsteps, Xue Po turned to look at Nian Bing. He happened not to see the astonished gazes of the Blood Lion Seven Elders. His expression slightly darkened, and he said, \"Are all the dishes ready? You came back so late today. If there's a next time, I'll dock your wages. Where's the Young Miss? Have you seen the Young Miss?\"\n\nNian Bing awoke from his daze. In an instant, he understood. It turned out that the other military official controlled by the Blood Lion Sect was none other than Blood-Devouring Soul-Destroyer Xue Po, one of the three marshals. The sudden turn of events left Nian Bing feeling somewhat dumbfounded. The support he had been trying to win turned out to be from his own subordinate; how bizarre was that!\n\nThinking this, Nian Bing couldn't help but smile slightly, \"The Young Miss wants to learn cooking skills from me. She just recognized me as her Big Brother and is currently in the kitchen. I'll go call her over now.\"\n\n\"What? Yu'er recognized you as Big Brother?\" Madam Xue couldn't help but frown slightly. Although she wasn't someone who cared about social status, Nian Bing's identity as a cook was simply too disparate from Xue Yu's. Her greatest fear was that her daughter would be attracted to Nian Bing's handsome appearance, and at Nian Bing's words, Madam Xue's heart immediately sank. She thought, *My greatest fear has indeed come true.*\n\nCompared to Madam Xue's surprise, a hint of murderous intent had already appeared in Xue Po's eyes. He had already been suspicious of Nian Bing, but because Nian Bing hadn't shown any unusual behavior in the past few days, his doubts had significantly lessened. Now, when Nian Bing suddenly said that his daughter had recognized him as her brother, Xue Po's murderous intent immediately flared. However, with distinguished guests at the door, the killing intent merely flashed in his eyes before quickly returning to normal. He calmly said, \"Alright, then go call the Young Miss over.\" He had already decided that after the distinguished guests left, he would apprehend Nian Bing and thoroughly interrogate him about his intentions.\n\nHaving realized the true relationship between Xue Po and the Blood Lion Sect, Nian Bing naturally had no intention of hiding anything. A smile appeared in his eyes as he said to the Great Elder and the others, \"Seven Elders, I didn't expect us to meet again so soon.\"\n\nXue Po's heart jolted. He turned to look at the Great Elder and only then realized that the seven elders had already stood up. He asked in confusion, \"Great Elder, is he also a member of our sect?\" His surprise deepened even more than before. If Nian Bing also belonged to the Blood Lion Sect, then all his previous worries were unnecessary.\n\nSeeing that Nian Bing had not concealed his identity, the Great Elder and the other six hurriedly stepped forward and respectfully said, \"The Blood Lion Seven Elders greet the Sect Master.\"\n\nNian Bing waved his hand casually and said, \"Seven Elders, there's no need for such formality.\"\n\nThe Great Elder spoke in a low voice to Xue Po, \"This is our sect's newly appointed Sect Master, Bai. He has already passed the Blood Lion Hall's test and has formally ascended to the position of Sect Master of our sect. Why don't you quickly pay your respects?\"\n\nXue Po's heart was filled with terror. He said to the Great Elder, \"But, but he's just a cook in my manor!\"\n\nThis time, even the seven elders were somewhat surprised. The Great Elder frowned and said, \"What nonsense are you spouting? Quickly pay your respects to our Sect Master!\"\n\nAlthough Xue Po's heart was full of doubt, he dared not be disrespectful at this moment. He hurriedly and respectfully said, \"Xue Po, Provisional Elder of the Blood Lion Hall, greets the Sect Master.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled. \"Elder Xue Po, there's no need for such formality. I never thought, truly, I never thought that I was trying to find a way to persuade you to help me, only to find that we are already family. I have just taken over as Sect Master, Elder, so please don't be so polite. In the future, I will need you to contribute more to our sect.\"\n\nThe collar of Xue Po's clothes at his back was already soaked with cold sweat. As a Provisional Elder of the Blood Lion Hall, he naturally knew very well the test required to become a formal Sect Master. Judging by the expressions of the seven elders, it was clear that Nian Bing had already passed that perverse test, showing how formidable his strength was. Moreover, he had actually let Nian Bing work as a cook for so many days. Although Xue Po was the renowned Blood-Devouring Soul-Destroyer in front of others and held a considerable position in the Blood Lion Hall, his rank was still far too below that of the Sect Master. Kneeling on one knee, he said fearfully, \"Xue Po was unaware of the Sect Master's arrival earlier and was very disrespectful. Please punish me, Sect Master.\"",

    "title": "Chapter 144 The Prepared Elder of the Blood Lion Hall (Part 2)",
    "content": "「To have a talent like you is truly a blessing for our Sect.」The sudden change left him feeling somewhat bemused. Speaking of which, he turned to the seven Elders and said, 「Come, everyone, please take a seat. I put quite a bit of effort into preparing this meal. Elders, please have a taste.」With that, he led the Elders and Xue Po's couple to their seats. Although Xue Po repeatedly insisted Nian Bing take the head seat, Nian Bing ultimately chose an outer seat and sat down casually.\n\nThe First Elder gazed in surprise at the table filled with exquisite dishes he had never seen before. Before he could speak, the somewhat impatient Third Elder blurted out, 「Sect Master, no way, are you really working as a chef at Xue Po's house?」\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, 「My other profession is indeed a chef! Elder Xue Po, I haven't lied to you at all. In a few months, I'll be representing Qingfeng Zhai at the Cooking God Competition.」\n\nXue Po gave a bitter smile, 「Sect Master, please don't say any more, I'm truly ashamed!」\n\nMadam Xue walked to Xue Po's side and bowed to Nian Bing, saying, 「Your subordinate, Madam Xue, probationary Elder of Snow Lion Hall, greets the Elder.」\n\nNian Bing was already surprised that Xue Po was a member of the Blood Lion Sect; he hadn't expected Madam Xue to also be one of them. The First Elder, sensing Nian Bing's confusion, quickly explained, 「Xue Po is my eldest disciple. In fact, he's your grandfather's junior martial brother. His wife is the Second Elder's disciple, cultivating Dark Magic. Although she hasn't reached the Archmage realm yet, she possesses a peculiar Innate Domain. Her domain is called Hidden Demon. This domain doesn't consume much magical power and can constantly protect her body's surface. It has no offensive, defensive, or amplification effects, but it can completely conceal one's magical aura. She is also a rare talent in our Sect.」\n\nMadam Xue appeared much calmer than Xue Po. She smiled faintly, 「First Elder, you flatter me. My Innate Domain is no different from having none. It only brings shame upon my master.」\n\nAlthough Madam Xue said so, how could Nian Bing, deeply familiar with the mysteries of magic, not know the wondrous uses of this Innate Domain called Hidden Demon? Even with his Heavenly Eye Acupoint, he couldn't detect any abilities from Madam Xue; she seemed like an ordinary person. She should be a Magic Seeker now. A Magic Seeker who appears ordinary but suddenly acts would certainly be terrifying. This Hidden Demon Domain must be Madam Xue's greatest secret, and he probably wouldn't have learned of it if he weren't the Sect Master of the Blood Lion Sect.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was about to say something, Xue Yu's voice suddenly rang out, 「Big Brother Nian Bing! Why aren't you out yet? Your cooking just now was absolutely amazing! You have to start teaching me tonight.」As she spoke, Xue Yu had already run into the living room.\n\nSeeing his daughter appear, Xue Po's face darkened. He said, 「Yu'er, don't be rude. Can't you see we have guests?」\n\nXue Yu had been completely stunned by Nian Bing's cooking earlier. When she came to her senses, she immediately rushed to find Nian Bing, having completely forgotten about the guests at home today. She curiously glanced at the seven elderly Elders, stuck out her tongue, and said, 「Oh, I'm sorry, Papa, I just came to call Nian Bing. We'll go now.」As she spoke, she waved at Nian Bing.\n\nXue Po said, 「Alright, Yu'er, you go on down first. Nian Bing and I still have some matters to discuss; let him introduce the dishes he made to the guests.」Xue Yu had always been afraid of her father. Seeing Xue Po's face darken, she immediately dared not say anything more, gave Nian Bing a few glances, and then retreated.\n\nXue Yu gave Nian Bing glances, and Xue Po and Madam Xue naturally saw them. Both of their gazes seemed a bit odd, but neither said anything.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, 「Elder Xue Po, Madam, you don't need to misunderstand. I just felt quite a connection with Miss Xue, so I recognized her as my younger sister. I only regard her as a sister. Xue Yu is a good girl. Today, she told me she wants to learn cooking to find a good husband later. I can tell she already has someone in her heart. If there's an opportunity, I'll teach her some cooking. It seems she's not a member of our Sect yet, is she?」His meaning was clear: he was telling Xue Po and his wife not to worry, that he had no such intentions towards their daughter and only saw her as a sister.\n\nXue Po secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Although Nian Bing's status was honorable, judging by his handsome appearance and unknown formidable strength, marrying such a person might not necessarily lead to happiness. Hearing Nian Bing say this, his expression immediately brightened considerably. He sighed softly and said, 「Yu'er has been mischievous since she was little, with little interest in martial arts or magic, so her strength is quite weak. That's why I didn't let her join the Sect, and she doesn't know we are members. Sect Master, please don't laugh, but the person Yu'er likes is the Seventh Prince, whom you wish to meet. Although the Seventh Prince has some peculiar preferences, his appearance and character are indeed good. When Yu'er was fourteen, I was away on a military campaign, and Yu'er ran out to play and encountered some bad people. The Seventh Prince happened to save her, and from then on, Yu'er secretly fell in love with him. However, we still don't understand why the Seventh Prince has such a peculiar fondness; although he hasn't done anything improper, he seems only interested in men. Yu'er and the Seventh Prince have become friends, but they act more like siblings all the time. If you wish to meet the Seventh Prince, going through Yu'er would be much easier than through me.」\n\nNian Bing paused, giving a bitter smile inwardly. He hadn't expected that the opportunity he had always sought to meet Yan Feng had already presented itself. Given his relationship with Xue Yu, asking her to take him to see Yan Feng would indeed be no problem at all.\n\n「Elder Xue Po, I believe the purpose of the seven Elders coming to see you today is the same as mine. This time, I've come to Ice Moon City precisely because our Sect is about to undertake a major operation, and we will need your cooperation for it.」As he spoke, a seven-colored light flashed around Nian Bing's body, and a barrier enveloped the entire room, completely isolating the sounds within.\n\nXue Po quickly asked, 「What is this matter that has brought the Sect Master and seven Elders personally to Ice Moon City?」\n\nThe First Elder said solemnly, 「Of course it's a major matter. Our purpose in coming to Ice Moon City is twofold: first, to conduct the probation test for the new Sect Master, and second, to take action against the Ice Moon Empire. This operation concerns the future development of our Sect. Not only have we come, but we have also ordered the deployment of five hundred Blood Guards from our Hall.」Nian Bing and the First Elder had already decided after their discussion to deploy combat personnel from other branch halls. The five hundred Blood Guards from the Blood Lion Hall are the strongest in the Blood Lion Sect. To prevent too great a blow to the Blood Lion Sect if they failed, they decided to rely on the five hundred Blood Guards and the combat personnel of the Ice Moon Hall to collectively complete this mission.\n\nNian Bing said, 「This operation is named 'Changing the Heavens.'」\n\nXue Po was startled. He said, 「Are we going to…」\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, 「It's not what you're thinking. Although our Sect's hidden power is great, it cannot contend against a nation. We merely intend to assist a prince in ascending the throne. Even so, it's a significant risk. This operation will heavily rely on Elder Xue Po's assistance.」\n\nXue Po's heart stirred. He said, 「Are you going to assist that inactive Seventh Prince?」\n\nNian Bing nodded, 「Precisely, it's him. Yan Feng and I have a good relationship. Furthermore, he hasn't been corrupted by the royal family's decadent aura. If he ascends the throne, it will only benefit us. Were it any other prince, we would find it very difficult to control them.」\n\nXue Po thought for a moment and said, 「So, should I announce my support for the Seventh Prince now?」\n\nNian Bing shook his head, 「No, the time is not yet ripe. After all, Yan Feng currently has no support from any faction. If you rashly support him, it will backfire. What we need to do now is create various situations to push him into that position. I will naturally inform you when your presence is needed. You are a pivotal minister in the military. For now, I just want you to pay close attention to the military's movements. After all, once the First Prince, Second Prince, and Fifth Prince contend for the throne, it will inevitably involve the military. Whoever gains the military's true support will be able to secure the imperial throne.」\n\nXue Po mused, 「Currently, the Ice Moon Empire's military is controlled by us three Marshals. Although the General Headquarters holds great power, we three Marshals mutually restrain each other. While my subordinates are the most elite, their numbers are the smallest, and our stationed location is not close to Ice Moon City. There haven't been any wars in recent years, and the other two Marshals are also in Ice Moon City. They have already given their support to the First Prince and Fifth Prince respectively. It won't be easy to enable the Seventh Prince to achieve something!」Nian Bing smiled placidly, a cold gleam in his eyes. 「Indeed, it won't be easy, but it's not without opportunity. When these three princes begin to attack each other, that will be our greatest opportunity. Various factions in Ice Moon City are in turmoil. The Fifth Prince has now successfully won over the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild. If my guess is correct, he will soon return to Ice Moon City to consolidate his power and, at the same time, quickly seek the King's approval. He is currently the most promising candidate for succession. When he returns to Ice Moon City, that will be our time to act.」\n\nA hint of murderous intent flashed in Xue Po's eyes, and he made a slashing motion with his right hand. 「Your meaning is…」\n\nNian Bing shook his head, 「No, although with our strength we have a high certainty of killing him in an ambush, he cannot die yet. If he dies, one side will grow too powerful, and we will have even less opportunity. So, while we intend to kill, it will not be the Fifth Prince.」\n\n***\n\nSeven days later.\n\nThe Fifth Prince, Yan Yun, led his more than a hundred retainers slowly along the main road. From a distance, he could already see the tall city walls of Ice Moon City. Confidence surged within him as he thought to himself, 「Ice Moon City, I've returned. This time, I'm determined to become your master, the master of the entire Ice Moon Empire.」His journey to Ice Snow City had yielded considerable gains. Although Galamandis's appearance had caused him to lose the chance to pursue Xue Jing, he had gained the support of the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild. Now, he was full of confidence. He was back, and it was time to begin their operation.\n\n「Report—!」A guard from the Fifth Prince's residence, riding a fast horse, approached from the direction of Ice Moon City. Upon reaching the Fifth Prince's retinue, he quickly dismounted and knelt on one knee.",

    "content": "\"Tell me, has anything changed in Ice Moon City since I left?\" Though the Fifth Prince had gone to Ice Snow City, he dared not be careless about the situation in Ice Moon City. This was the most crucial moment in the struggle for the throne.\n\nThe guard said, \"Your Highness, since your departure, the First Prince and Second Prince have been very active, frequently meeting in private with ministers who support them, and even some who support you. Furthermore, Miss Bingyun of the Ice God Tower is currently in Ice Moon City.\"\n\n\"What? Miss Bingyun is in Ice Moon City?\" Upon hearing the name Bingyun, the Fifth Prince's eyes immediately lit up. Others might not know much about Bingyun, but he knew that Bingyun, known as \"Thousand Illusions,\" was the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's most favored disciple. The Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess doted on this disciple immensely, and Bingyun also possessed a rare innate domain. She was very likely to become the next Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess. Although the Fifth Prince coveted Bingyun's beauty, he hoped even more to gain her support. After all, while the Ice God Tower behind Bingyun was difficult to control, it symbolized a guardian deity in the Ice Moon Empire. If they supported him, his succession to the throne would be beyond any doubt.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Bingyun arrived in the city over ten days ago. However, her actions have been quite strange. She only contacted the Ice God Tower personnel in the city once, and has otherwise been staying in an obscure small inn, accompanied by a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl and a man.\"\n\nThe Fifth Prince's brows furrowed slightly. He knew that women from the Ice God Tower were very repulsed by men. The presence of a man with Bingyun made him feel a trace of unease. \"Alright, you may withdraw. Deliver my order: quicken our pace, return to Ice Moon City at once.\"\n\nJust as the Fifth Prince entered Ice Moon City, Nianbing, dressed in plain clothes, was waiting for someone in a private room at the Grand Guest Building, the most famous establishment in Ice Moon City.\n\nThe door to the private room opened, and a handsome man, exuding a cold aura, walked in. The moment he entered, he saw Nianbing, and the cold aura around him immediately melted. He said in surprise and delight, \"Nianbing, it's actually you who wanted to see me.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly and said, \"Please sit, Seventh Prince Your Highness.\" The man was indeed Yan Feng. These past few days, Nianbing had been secretly arranging for the Blood Lion Cult's operations and hadn't rushed to see Yan Feng. Only when he learned that the Fifth Prince would return to Ice Moon City today did he ask Xueyu for help to summon Yan Feng.\n\nYan Feng smiled bitterly, saying, \"What 'Your Highness' this and 'Your Highness' that? My title as a prince is merely nominal. Ah! What happened to your hair? Why did it turn white?\"\n\nNianbing shook his head, saying, \"No, you are a genuine Seventh Prince. My hair is nothing, just a small accident, it has no effect on me.\"\n\nYan Feng gave Nianbing a thumbs-up and said, \"Brother, you're truly something! You even defeated Thousand Illusions Bingyun. Afterwards, when I looked for you again, you had vanished without a trace. I didn't expect us to reunite here. No wonder Xueyu told me to come here. You know Xuejing, so it's normal to ask her sister for help. So, do you need something from me?\"\n\nNianbing nodded, saying, \"Indeed, I do have something. But first, let's eat something. I heard this Grand Guest Building is even more famous than Clear Breeze Pavilion, so the dishes here should be excellent. I've already ordered some of their most famous dishes. Of course, I'm very poor, so you'll have to pay the bill in the end.\"\n\nYan Feng laughed heartily, \"That's easy. Nianbing, there's something I've always wanted to ask you: do you consider me a brother?\"\n\nNianbing said, \"Of course. Haven't we always been friends?\" Though he said this aloud, he thought to himself, *It's fine to consider you a brother, but you better not have any other ideas.*\n\n\"Then why do you always quickly avoid me every time we meet? As if you're evading me.\"\n\nWatching the keen light in Yan Feng's eyes, Nianbing sighed softly, \"How should I put this? If I say it was a coincidence, would you believe me? Our first meeting was in Ice Snow City, and that time I wasn't trying to avoid you; you were recalled to Ice Moon City. Our second meeting was in the Huahong Empire. That time, I didn't participate in the final round of the culinary competition. It wasn't that I didn't want to; it was because I was being hunted and forced to withdraw. Even now, thinking about it fills me with some lingering fear; I nearly lost my life then. The last time, in Dutian City, although I also represented the Ice Moon Empire, I had a deep hatred for the Ice God Tower, and you were with people from the Ice God Tower. The situation was very complicated then. After winning the championship, my beloved woman was suddenly captured, and I didn't even have time to greet you before I went to rescue her. If you want to think I was deliberately avoiding you, I have nothing more to say.\"\n\nYan Feng gazed deeply at Nianbing's calm eyes. After a long moment, he sighed softly and said, \"Then I misunderstood. Actually, it wouldn't matter even if you were deliberately avoiding me. I know, who would genuinely want to be my friend?\"\n\nNianbing naturally understood the hidden meaning in his words. He said nothing more. At this point, the dishes were gradually being served. Nianbing hadn't ordered many dishes, only four dishes and one soup, but each dish was extremely exquisite, instantly whetting one's appetite.\n\n\"Come, Brother Yan, let's eat and talk.\" With that, Nianbing picked up his chopsticks first.\n\nYan Feng offered a slight smile and said, \"Nianbing, if I'm not mistaken, you came to find me today for something. Just tell me what it is. Although you may not consider me a friend, I certainly consider you mine. Frankly, you've always felt very mysterious to me—your excellent magic, your superb culinary skills. You must be a few years younger than me, yet you are far more outstanding.\"\n\nNianbing said, \"Then would you like to hear my story?\"\n\nYan Feng said with some surprise, \"You're willing to tell me?\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly, \"For my friends, there's no need for me to conceal anything. Actually, I'm not originally from the Ice Moon Empire. I was born into a prominent family in the Huahong Empire, but I had no childhood. In one respect, we are very similar: though our backgrounds are good, we are not happy. Compared to you, I've been even unluckier, because from the age of ten, I've lived in hatred.\" He then calmly recounted in detail his childhood experiences and the complex relationship between his parents, without mentioning anyone's name during the narration, until he completed his apprenticeship with Zhaji.\n\nAfter listening to Nianbing's words, a cold light flashed continuously in Yan Feng's eyes. \"Brother, I never knew your childhood was so unfortunate. Who exactly are your enemies? If I can help, I certainly will.\"\n\nNianbing gently shook his head, saying, \"Brother Yan, I cannot tell you who my enemies are for now. A parent's vengeance is a blood feud<sup>1</sup>; as a child, I must personally avenge my parents. I came to you today indeed with a request, but it's unrelated to revenge. My story is finished; would you allow me to hear yours? I can see that although you are a prince, you do not live happily. If you have something on your mind, it will feel much better to talk about it.\"\n\nYan Feng sighed softly, \"Brother, you have been so open and frank with me<sup>2</sup>, so I have nothing to conceal. Indeed, I am not happy being a prince, even less so than an ordinary person. Although my parents were always around when I was young, compared to your childhood, my experiences were not much better. As you know, my Imperial Father has a total of seven sons. The First Prince and Second Prince were born of the Empress. The other princes, as well as my sisters, were born of concubines in the harem, but I was not. Frankly, my existence in this world was simply an accident. It was because my father, after getting drunk once, unintentionally favored my mother, who was a palace maid. Unexpectedly, it happened just that once, and then I came into being.\" Speaking of this, a trace of sadness unconsciously emerged in his eyes.\n\nAfter a pause, Yan Feng continued, \"Later, because of me, my mother was conferred the title of concubine, the lowest rank, of course. The depravity in the harem is unimaginable to you. My mother sacrificed so much for me, I don't know how much. The Ice Moon Empire stipulates that any prince has the possibility of inheriting the throne. More princes naturally mean more competitors for the throne. The Empress, for her two sons, and Consort Ru, the Fifth Prince's mother, for her son, naturally ostracized other concubines. Except for my mother, the other concubines all had some backing and influence, so although they were bullied, it wasn't too severe. My poor mother, she was just a palace maid by birth. Except for the day I was born, she never saw my Imperial Father again until her death. My mother lived a very hard life; anyone in the palace could bully her. I was still young then and had no ability to protect her at all. Watching my mother grow thinner and weaker day by day, I really wished I could grow up quickly to protect her. But my mother didn't live to see that day. According to the palace staff, my mother committed suicide by throwing herself into the lake, but I knew very well that her death was not like that. Behind her death was a conspiracy orchestrated by the Empress, Consort Ru, and others. Without my mother's protection, they could deal with me more easily. That year, I was only eight years old.\" Speaking of this, Yan Feng unconsciously clenched his fists, and the chopsticks in his hand broke silently.\n\nNianbing picked up a tissue and handed it to Yan Feng, whose eyes were red-rimmed. He said nothing, simply waiting for Yan Feng to continue.\n\n\"Nianbing, do you know why I have that special peculiarity? It wasn't something I was born with; those wretches forced it upon me! From the day my mother died, their schemes began to target me. But I was a prince after all; even if I had no status, I was still one of the future heirs to the throne. They dared not kill me, but they secretly used despicable methods against me. I wasn't born disliking women; it was because of them that I became like this. Every day, palace maids sent by various concubines would come to me under the guise of taking care of me. But what they showed me were their hideous true colors. They insulted me, they even made me...\" At this point, his lips trembled slightly due to agitation. Taking a deep breath, Yan Feng managed to calm himself before continuing, \"So, from then on, I feared women. I developed an innate fear of women. Just when I was extremely helpless, my master appeared. His name was Zhi Yian. My master was only twenty-one years old that year, a very handsome man. His martial skills were very strong; at twenty-one, he was already close to the level of a martial artist. In complete contrast to those women, he was very gentle and extremely kind to me. He taught me martial arts and stayed by my side every day. How could I have known then that it was a conspiracy?\"\n\nNianbing already understood some of it and couldn't help but sigh inwardly at Yan Feng's plight.\n\n\"I grew up day by day. When I turned fourteen, my martial skills had a certain foundation. I was extremely attached to my master; he was like my everything. But on the night of my fourteenth birthday, my master actually laid his hands on me, a child. He violated my—\"\n\n\"Bastard!\" Nianbing cursed aloud. \"This must also be a conspiracy orchestrated by those despicable people in the harem! They were subtly changing your mindset, weren't they?\"\n\nYan Feng nodded with a bitter smile, \"Yes, but I was still young. Although I felt something was amiss, my master was so good to me that I didn't reject him at all. This twisted master-disciple relationship continued until I was seventeen. One day, my master suddenly died inexplicably. It's imaginable that he died because he had lost his value and knew the truth of the conspiracy. But by then, my personality had already changed. Even if I understood all this, what good was it? Could I contend against those people in the shadows? Later, I found an opportunity and moved out of the Imperial Palace. I hate so much, I hate everyone in the Imperial Palace, including my father. They are not my family; they are my enemies. If one day I gain the power to destroy them, I will act without hesitation. Unfortunately, I am just the least favored prince, and because of this special inclination, I am scorned by the world. What choice do I have? I can only silently continue to live in this environment. For me, there is no opportunity. How I wish I could have my own friends! Nianbing, are you willing to be my friend? Just a friend.\" At this moment, Yan Feng suddenly appeared very helpless and resigned. The sorrow within that resignation deeply affected Nianbing's heart. Originally, he had felt some guilt about the matter he needed to discuss with Yan Feng, but after hearing Yan Feng's childhood experiences, that guilt disappeared. He knew that what he had to do was not only for Ling'er but could also help Yan Feng.\n***\n<sup>1</sup> A parent's vengeance is a blood feud (父母之仇不共戴天): A Chinese idiom meaning that the hatred for one's parents' killers is so deep that one cannot coexist with them under the same sky; implying an unresolvable enmity that demands retribution.\n<sup>2</sup> So open and frank with me (推心置腹): A Chinese idiom literally meaning \"to place one's heart in another's belly,\" signifying complete trust, frankness, and sincerity in sharing one's deepest thoughts and feelings.",

    "content": "\"Yan Feng, I can be your friend, even your brother, but there is one thing you must promise me.\"\n\nThe sadness in Yan Feng's eyes vanished, replaced by surprise and joy. He said, \"Are you really willing to be my friend? Just tell me your conditions; I'll agree to anything I can do.\"\n\nNian Bing said seriously, \"Change your bad habits, forget all the shadows of your childhood, face yourself, and be a normal man.\"\n\nYan Feng was stunned for a moment. \"But, that's not easy to change!\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"It's not that it's difficult, but whether you have confidence in yourself. As long as you want to do it, you can definitely do it. Actually, it's not that hard at all; as long as you truly fall in love with a girl, all your problems will be solved.\"\n\nYan Feng gave a bitter laugh. \"That's even more impossible. My... hobby, under the deliberate exaggeration of those people, has long been known to everyone. Now, women in Ice Moon City avoid me when they see me.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Yan Feng, if you consider me your brother, then try this: How is your relationship with Xue Yu?\"\n\nYan Feng was startled. He said, \"Xue Yu? We're good brothers! I saved her back then... Wow, are you telling me to pursue her? How could that be? Although I don't feel the same fear towards Xue Yu as I do towards other women, don't forget, her father is Blood-devouring Soul-slayer Xue Po. How would her father allow someone like me to associate with her?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"You don't need to tell me all that; problems can always be solved. Just tell me: If you were to choose a girl to pursue, to try and change that... hobby of yours, how would Xue Yu as a choice be?\"\n\nYan Feng hesitated. \"If, if I really have to try pursuing a woman... then, then I think Xue Yu would be better. But Yu'er is a good girl; I'm afraid I'd harm her! Besides, she's always seen me as a good brother, how could I even bring it up?\"\n\nNian Bing said irritably, \"Only you would think that, you fool. In fact, when you saved Xue Yu back then, your image was already deeply etched in her heart. As long as you're willing to try, I can be your matchmaker. As for Marshal Xue, you don't need to worry. I'll take care of everything. But, you have to promise me: if you truly get together with Yu'er in the future, you must treat her well.\"\n\nYan Feng's eyes widened as he looked at Nian Bing. \"You're not serious, are you? You didn't come to find me today just for Yu'er's sake, did you? Yu'er, Yu'er, she actually... No, that's impossible! I've been with her, and she's always treated me like a brother!\"\n\nNian Bing scoffed. \"You are foolish. Yu'er likes you too much, and she knew you had that hobby, so she was afraid of putting pressure on you. That's why she only treated you as a brother on the surface. Wake up. When a woman is willing to learn cooking for a man, what does that represent? Women only make such efforts for the man they love most. Yu'er has always been silently waiting for you, waiting for the day you change. Don't disappoint her.\"\n\nYan Feng was completely stunned. He had never imagined that his only friend before meeting Nian Bing would actually like someone like him.\n\n\"Liking someone requires no reason. In the face of love, all flaws are naturally concealed. Yan Feng, if you are a man, then think this through carefully. This is your chance! If you can truly fall in love with Yu'er, then you will be completely free from the schemes of the Empress and her people, becoming a true man who stands tall. Don't you want to avenge your mother? Don't you want to do something about the insults you've suffered? Are you just going to continue like this, doing nothing every day, until death? A person, from birth, if they have no goal in life, then what's the difference between them and a dead person? Sober up. The matter with Yu'er is the first step you must take to become a true man.\"\n\nYan Feng looked at Nian Bing, listening to his sharp words. His heart gradually wavered. What Nian Bing opened for him was a door to light; he seemed to have seen the dawn's first light. In the dead of night, he couldn't count how many times he had recalled his own experiences, recalling the terrified yet unwilling look in his mother's eyes at her death. He wanted revenge; he thought about it constantly, but he knew deep down that with his status in the Ice Moon Empire, it was almost impossible to contend with the Empress and her people. Yet, today, Nian Bing seemed to be pointing him towards a path, a path of sunshine. Xue Yu's voice, looks, smile, and demeanor kept flashing in his mind. Recalling all the things that happened when Xue Yu was with him before, Yan Feng gradually came to believe Nian Bing's words. 'Indeed!' he thought. How could a girl constantly be with him for no reason? But all this came so fast; he really found it hard to accept it at once. \"Nian Bing, can you let me think about it? My mind is so confused.\"\n\nNian Bing picked up some delicious dishes and brought them to his mouth. Although these dishes were exquisite and tasted excellent, there was nothing particularly novel about them. Nian Bing knew that to taste the dishes prepared by Hong Bin Tower's true master chefs, his current status was not enough. He ate quietly, not forcing Yan Feng, because he knew that at this moment, Yan Feng needed to figure everything out for himself. Only when he truly understood and realized all this could things proceed. After hearing about Yan Feng's experiences, Nian Bing decided not to pressure him, but only to help him walk the path he had designed – a path that would certainly not be bad for Yan Feng.\n\nYan Feng sat there, deep in thought, continuously recalling everything Nian Bing had said. After a long while, when the dishes in front of him had diminished by a third, he finally looked up.\n\n\"Nian Bing, thank you. I know you're doing this for my own good. Only now can I truly feel that you consider me a friend. Alright, I'll listen to you; I'll try. And you can rest assured, unless I can marry Yu'er in the future, I will never make any untoward moves toward her. Since I've chosen, I will definitely work hard. I want to become a true man, to completely step out of my past shadows.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"I didn't misjudge you. I knew you would choose this. Believe in yourself; this is the most correct choice. Yan Feng, we are friends now.\"\n\nYan Feng smiled slightly, raising the teacup on the table. He said, \"Then let's drink a cup of tea instead of wine.\" Their porcelain cups clinked together with a crisp sound. After drinking the tea, Yan Feng continued, \"Nian Bing, from your words, it seems you have a very unusual relationship with Marshal Xue. However, regarding Yu'er, I don't want you to interfere anymore. I don't want Marshal Xue to agree to my relationship with Yu'er because of you. If that were the case, I still wouldn't be able to truly stand up.\"\n\nA hint of approval appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. He nodded and said, \"Good, then I'll leave everything to you. I believe you can do your best and gain Marshal Xue's approval through your own abilities.\"\n\nYan Feng nodded. \"I've been decadent for so many years; it's time to pull myself together. I don't care about other matters. But I must become a true man.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Although you haven't achieved it yet, in my heart, you are already a true man. Since that's the case, I can now state my purpose for coming. I came to find you today to ask for a favor. This is a request as a friend, and as a brother.\"\n\nYan Feng smiled slightly. \"Just say it. Didn't I just say that as long as it's something I can do, I'll do my best?\"\n\nNian Bing looked at him with a meaningful gaze and said, \"What if this matter could threaten your life? Would you still help me?\"\n\nYan Feng frowned slightly. \"Nian Bing. Are you testing me? You think too lightly of me, Yan Feng. The moment I understood everything that happened in my childhood, I already stopped valuing my own life. Perhaps, death would be happier for me. The only reason I'm still alive is because I want to see what fate awaits those despicable scoundrels in the end; that's why I'm reluctant to die.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"Good, truly worthy of being my brother, Yan Feng. You want to see what fate awaits those people? Then why don't you dictate their outcome? Taking everything into your own hands and seeking revenge with your own strength—that would be the most perfect.\"\n\nYan Feng gave a bitter laugh. \"I've thought about it, of course I've thought about it, but how could that be possible? You know who my enemies are; compared to them, I am truly insignificant. Nian Bing, I know you really want to help me, but...\"\n\nNian Bing's expression darkened. He said, \"It seems what you lack most is self-confidence. Although you are one person, you still have the identity of the Seventh Prince. What about me? I'm also one person. What do I have? Do I have a noble status like yours? No, I don't. But my enemies are just as powerful, absolutely no less than yours. Now, I'm not afraid to tell you: my enemy is the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, known as the guardian deity of the Ice Moon Empire.\"\n\n\"What?\" Yan Feng exclaimed, losing his voice. \"You, what did you say? Your enemy is the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess?!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly. \"That's right, it's her. My mother was once the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's disciple. Combining that with my story, I suppose you might already understand my origins. I'm also just one person, but I'm different from you. Even knowing how powerful my enemy is, I haven't lost heart. Since I was ten years old, I've been striving, waiting, and enduring. I believe that one day I will become strong enough to destroy my enemy. My enemy is the only Divine Descender on the continent! Yet, I still relentlessly strive. What about you? What have you been doing all these years? If your mother saw you enduring so cowardly, so weakly decadent, what would she think? Are you still worthy of being her son?\"\n\nYan Feng lowered his head. A fine layer of sweat had appeared on his forehead. Although Nian Bing's voice was calm, every word was like a sharp knife piercing deep into his heart. He hated himself, hated why he was so lacking in ambition. He knew Nian Bing was right; everything had to be fought for by oneself. If one didn't try, how would one know if they could succeed?\n\nNian Bing said, \"Now, I should tell you the purpose of my visit. As you know, I come from the Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild, and this time, I even represented the Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild in winning the Five Nations Rising Star Magician Competition. Because of this victory, my teacher, Long Zhi, appointed me as the Guild's Vice President. I have a confidante, whom you also know: Long Ling, Teacher Long's only daughter, known as the Gentle Woman. Ling'er is a very gentle girl; she has been silently giving to me, just like Yu'er has given to you. This time, my return to the Ice Moon Empire is not for the Magician's Guild, nor for revenge, but for Ling'er. Although my current strength has reached a certain level, I am still far from achieving revenge. I just want to give Ling'er a happy life. But then, your fifth brother appeared—the Fifth Prince, who is most likely to inherit the throne. You are also a prince; you should know what he was doing, right?\"\n\nYan Feng's heart stirred. He said, \"I heard that when Fifth Brother went to Ice Snow City this time, although ostensibly investigating the disappearance of the Wise Woman Luo Rou's family, he secretly contacted the Ice Snow City Lord and the Magician's Guild, hoping to gain their support. My Imperial Father's health is now very poor, and this is the most crucial time for the succession struggle for the throne.\"\n\nNian Bing sneered. \"It seems your information isn't quite up to date. Your Fifth Brother didn't just go to win people over; he also wanted these people to declare their stance. He found my Teacher Long and made a demand.\"\n\n\"What demand?\" Yan Feng asked curiously.\n\nNian Bing said coldly, \"He wants to marry Long Ling. As a member of the royal family, you should understand that this is a political marriage. My teacher clearly understands the Fifth Prince's current position, and at the same time, he has always wanted to find an opportunity to glorify and expand the Ice Moon Empire Magician's Guild. Facing such a good opportunity, how could he possibly give it up? So, he agreed to the Fifth Prince's request and decided to marry Ling'er to him.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Yan Feng couldn't help but exclaim in surprise. \"Then, what will you do? Miss Long Ling should like you, right?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly. \"What does that matter? In Teacher Long's heart, how can romantic love compare to his great ambition? To be frank with you, if I only wanted to be with Ling'er, I could simply elope with her. But Ling'er is a very filial girl; she has depended on her father since childhood. Even if she were willing to leave Ice Snow City and elope with me, I know she wouldn't truly be happy afterward. If Ling'er disappeared, the Fifth Prince would certainly take out his anger on the Magician's Guild. Whether because Long Zhi was once my teacher or because he is Ling'er's father, I cannot let such a thing happen. So, I cannot take Ling'er away. I must do something to make this marriage naturally disappear. Before leaving Ice Snow City, I had a talk with Teacher Long Zhi. I asked him to give me three months. Within these three months, I must change the current situation. That's why I came to Ice Moon City, and why I found you.\"",

    "content": "Yan Feng's brows slightly furrowed. \"Then what do you want me to help you with? I have no affection whatsoever for those so-called brothers of mine. In their eyes, I'm not even a person. Even if I went to explain things to Fifth Brother for you, he wouldn't listen to me. In his heart, nothing is more important than the imperial throne. Nian Bing, I'm afraid I can't help you with this.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head. \"No, you're wrong. Only you can help me with this. Only you.\" Yan Feng was startled. \"Me? Then how do you want me to help you? Perhaps, if Marshal Xue went to see my Fifth Brother, there might be some possibility. But Fifth Brother would definitely propose conditions, and that wouldn't be good for you or Marshal Xue.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Of course I understand. If Marshal Xue were to go to your Fifth Brother, he might very well give up the Dragon Spirit. However, it's even more likely that he'd seize the opportunity and demand that Marshal Xue betroth Ling'er to him. In his heart, although the Mage Guild is important, it absolutely cannot compare to a National Marshal. Am I right?\"\n\nYan Feng looked at Nian Bing. He suddenly realized that Nian Bing, who had just become his sworn brother, was somewhat terrifying at this moment—terrifyingly calm, as if these matters weren't happening to him. Nian Bing's calm and insightful gaze made Yan Feng's heart tremble. \"Then, then what do you want to do?\" At this point, Yan Feng was completely led by Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"What I want to do is very simple: as long as Fifth Prince doesn't ascend to the throne, his agreement with the Ice Moon Empire Mage Guild will naturally be canceled, and he'll be unable to become Ling'er's husband.\"\n\nYan Feng's expression changed slightly. \"Are you going to help First Brother and Second Brother? Nian Bing, there's something I must tell you. Compared to Fifth Brother, First Brother and Second Brother are even more despicable. Moreover, their mother is my greatest enemy. I really don't want...\"\n\nNian Bing waved his hand. \"No, if I were to help your First Brother or Second Brother, at most it would just prevent Fifth Prince from taking the throne. However, my master is very greedy. He hopes his Mage Guild can expand significantly. So, his demands aren't that small. His ultimate goal is to achieve the status that Ice God Tower currently holds within the Ice Moon Empire. Do you think either the First Prince or the Second Prince could help achieve that goal? Simply put, even if I were to help these two princes, would they listen to my advice in the future?\"\n\n\"No,\" Yan Feng said with certainty. \"Neither my First Brother nor my Second Brother. They are both pigheaded and self-opinionated. Let alone you. Even the Empress finds it difficult to influence them now.\"\n\nA cold light flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. \"Therefore, I can't help them. However, to change the current situation, I need to help someone seize the position of Emperor of the Ice Moon Empire. And that person is you. You are my brother. If you ascend to that position, I believe you will definitely help me. Help me overcome this difficulty, help Ling'er and me become partners.\"\n\n\"Me?\" Yan Feng didn't react for a moment. Suddenly, he stood up from his seat, slamming his hands on the table. \"Nian Bing, you, you mean, you mean you're going to help me take the throne?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"Brother Yan, quiet down a bit. Although I've already set up a soundproofing barrier here, if your voice is too loud, it might still carry outside. That's right, I'm going to help you become the next king of the Ice Moon Empire. You are also a prince and have the possibility of inheriting the throne. Why just be an onlooker? Why can't you strive for the throne? That's unfair to you. So, I am going to help you take this position. Only with our relationship will you genuinely help me once you're on the throne, isn't that right? Originally, before seeing you, I was a bit apprehensive because I always thought you had no desire for power. If that were the case, I wouldn't want to force you. However, after hearing about your past experiences, I realized that you're not without desire for power; on the contrary, you have a great desire for it, but you forcibly suppressed your own desires just to survive. Am I right? Now, the opportunity is right before your eyes. For your mother, and for yourself, are you willing to take this risk with me and give it a try?\"\n\nYan Feng stared blankly at Nian Bing. \"Are you serious? Did I hear you correctly?\"\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile. \"Do you think I'd joke about something like this? Wouldn't that mean I'm crazy?\"\n\nYan Feng also showed a bitter smile. \"But there are only two of us! Do you think we can have the power to contend for the throne just by talking about it? You have to understand, my father's final decision is the most important. Only if he decides who the true successor is can that person possibly become Emperor. Not to mention that in his eyes, I'm just a good-for-nothing. Even if he really did hand the throne to me, with First Brother, Second Brother, and Fifth Brother on the side, and me with no power or influence, who would help me? Even if I did sit on that position, it probably wouldn't last a day.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"That's not necessarily true! We still have time now. As long as you're willing, we can give it a try. Perhaps a miracle will appear? You and I, we only have one life. So what if we fail? At least we would have tried. What's more, we might not even fail.\"\n\nYan Feng mused, \"Then what do you want to do? Actually, I don't care. After hearing your words today, I've had an epiphany. Rather than living like this in a daze, it's better to try and do something, even if it means being reviled for eternity, it's still far better than being useless. Let me hear your ideas.\" Nian Bing looked at Yan Feng. He knew that the Seventh Prince before him was definitely not as decadent as he appeared on the surface. He had just deliberately acted that way. He wasn't without intelligence or talent; he just hadn't dared to show it. The speed with which he recovered from his initial surprise showed that he was indeed someone capable of great things. By this point, Nian Bing was sure that he had passed Yan Feng's test, and all actions could now proceed smoothly.\n\n\"Yan Feng. First, I want to ask you something. If your brothers, or even your Imperial Father, were to die, would you be sad because of it, or find it unbearable?\"\n\nYan Feng looked calmly at Nian Bing. \"Do you think I would? What do you think they would feel if I died? Like an ant dying. They've never treated me as a brother. Likewise, I've never treated them as family. Even if everyone in the Ice Moon Empire's Imperial Palace died, I wouldn't feel the slightest sadness for them. Nian Bing, if I'm not mistaken, you must have a detailed plan before coming to me. There's no need to hide anything. We are brothers. Since I've decided to cooperate with you, we're in the same boat. Tell me, what do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Good, since that's the case, I have nothing to hide either. Brother Yan, the first thing we need to do is change your image in the eyes of the people of Ice Moon City, and at the same time, change your image in your Imperial Father's eyes. This is the most important thing.\"\n\nYan Feng nodded. \"That's true. No one would want a homosexual to inherit the throne.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"Therefore, from now on, you must openly and conspicuously pursue Yu'er, and make sure everyone knows about it. I think most people in Ice Moon City who know you're homosexual only heard it through rumors; only a few truly know the truth. So, as long as you make a big show of pursuing Yu'er, it will at least help change your reputation. You not only need to pursue her, but also frequently appear publicly with her. You can rest assured, your imperial brothers are currently striving to secure their positions in your Imperial Father's heart, so no one will make a move against you. What's more, no one will even pay attention to you. In fact, that's our biggest advantage! Only by remaining hidden in the dark and not attracting anyone's attention can we develop better.\"\n\nYan Feng laughed. \"Nian Bing, I never expected you to have such talent not only in cooking and magic, but also in politics. If I really manage to become Emperor in the future, I'll definitely make you my prime minister. How about that?\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled. \"Let's just forget it. You have no idea how many methods I've tried these past few days to make Ling'er happy and be with me. Don't you see I've even thought my hair white? I've put all my effort into this. As for the future, I still hope to live a free life. When you become Emperor, just don't forget me, your brother.\"\n\nYan Feng sighed softly. \"You truly are someone who doesn't seek fame or fortune. I can see that for you, nothing is more important than freedom. All right, I'll follow your arrangements. We'll start everything tomorrow. Nian Bing, what should we do next? If I want to contend for the throne, I must gain the support of more ministers. But Father's health is getting worse day by day, and time is too short. I'm afraid...\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"You don't need to worry about any of that. I will work hard for you. There are some things I can't tell you right now. What I can let you know is that I have many friends. These friends will be of some help to you. You'll gradually understand later. Starting tomorrow, you don't need to concern yourself with anything else. I will naturally contact you. What you need to do is wholeheartedly pursue Yu'er and become a true man.\"\n\nYan Feng looked at Nian Bing with some confusion. \"From your expression, you seem very confident.\" Nian Bing gave a wry smile. \"Originally, I didn't have even half a chance, but I've recently met a few friends. With their help, I now have a thirty percent chance. Oh, that reminds me. I have something to tell you. Tomorrow—no, today—Ice Moon City will likely enter a period of turmoil. Remember my words: don't worry about anything else; just wholeheartedly pursue your Yu'er. During times of turmoil, no one will pay attention to you.\"\n\n\"Turmoil? Nian Bing, what are you going to do?\" A series of lights flashed in Yan Feng's eyes.\n\nNian Bing smiled mysteriously. \"You'll understand soon enough. It won't take too long. All right, I've eaten my fill. I hope that by the next time we meet, you and Yu'er will have made some progress. Hahahaha.\"\n\nOn the main street of Ice Moon City, a middle-aged man in a blue robe, appearing to be in his thirties, was slowly walking down the street. Behind him followed over ten attendants. These attendants looked unremarkable on the surface, but a careful observer could easily notice their extraordinary qualities. Just their constantly scanning gazes revealed that these people had a deep understanding of coordinated attacks, and especially when it came to protecting their master, they relied on a special talent. Their gazes covered almost all blind spots around them, and their positions firmly protected the blue-robed man in front. Should any change occur, they could use their bodies to shield him, clearly having undergone specialized training.\n\nThe blue-robed man stopped at a teahouse. The waiter clearly recognized him and politely led him to a private room upstairs. Two of his subordinates followed him into the private room, while the others waited outside, coldly observing the surroundings.\n\nJust as the blue-robed man settled down, a lavishly dressed middle-aged man anxiously rushed up. He didn't enter the private room but respectfully called from outside the door, \"Your Highness, it's little A Fu!\" The blue-robed man's indifferent voice rang out. \"Hm, let Boss Fu come in.\" Only then did the men guarding the door nod to Boss Fu, allowing him to enter. As soon as Boss Fu entered, he immediately knelt to salute the blue-robed man. The blue-robed man remained sprawled there, accepting the salute naturally, and said, \"Boss Fu, your business has been good recently!\"\n\nBoss Fu then stood up, standing respectfully to the side with his hands hanging down. \"Thanks to Your Highness, business here has been quite good recently. I've already had someone brew the best Tieguanyin; it will be brought up to you immediately. It's the top grade among this year's new teas.\"\n\nA satisfied smile appeared in the blue-robed man's eyes. \"Hm. You always know how to conduct yourself. I suppose you wouldn't dare to fool me. I haven't been here for a few days; have there been any new people come in?\"\n\nBoss Fu fawned, \"Yes, yes. I've been keeping them for Your Highness. Recently, a pair of sisters arrived, both virgins. Originally, several customers took a liking to them and offered high prices. But as soon as I thought of Your Highness, I turned them all away. These two young girls are still very unpolished, perfect for Your Highness's taste.\"\n\nThe blue-robed man's eyes lit up. \"Good, good. I like them unpolished; that's how they're interesting to train. Old Fu! Don't worry, I won't mistreat you. It's rare to find such consideration.\"",
