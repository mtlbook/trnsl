    "content": "Thank you all for your continuous support of Xiao San. For this new book, Xiao San wants to write a novel about a protagonist who uses only magic. Of course, it will be a peculiar kind of magic. A combination of magic and culinary arts, I hope you all will like it. Fellow book lovers, please bookmark it for now. This book will begin updating when the free VIP period is completely over, tentatively scheduled for August 1st. I will definitely bring something new to this series, so please continue to support Xiao San. Starting from August 1st, for both the public and future VIP chapters, I will update at least two chapters per day.\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  The clouds and mist were ethereal, drifting like smoke. A gentle breeze swept in, bringing a damp breath of air to the mountaintop.\n\n  The mist passed and the clouds drifted away, revealing a bare mountaintop. In the very center of the summit, a large, tall fatty sat on the ground, chewing on something. \"Sigh, I've already eaten my last chicken leg. Why isn't that guy here yet? He must be doing this on purpose to whet my appetite. It's really not easy to get a grand meal out of him. Oh, heavens! Why couldn't he be a woman? If he were, I'd risk my old life to marry her and have her comfort my stomach every day.\" As he spoke, the fatty rubbed his belly with his large, greasy hands, his face full of lament. However, an expression of lament on his large, fat face only made him look comical.\n\n  \"Fatty, you're daydreaming again. Do you think I still can't beat you this time? If I win, you must return Feng Nü to me.\" The low voice seemed to come from the Nine Serenities.\n\n  Seven points of brilliant light drifted down, and with a soft *ding*, landed before the fatty simultaneously in the formation of the Big Dipper. They were seven knives, but only their hilts were visible. The end of each hilt was inlaid with a brilliant gemstone of a different shape and color. Blue, red, cyan, yellow, silver, white, and black—the seven colors shone in dazzling interplay, instantly blanketing the summit in a hazy, gem-like light.\n\n  This was no ordinary gem-light, but a special barrier that fused seven magical elements. Unless the caster willed it or the seven gems powering the barrier were completely destroyed, no one could move these seven knives.\n\n  The fatty clapped and laughed. \"Excellent, excellent, the little treasures are all here. And the kid who uses them, you come out too. Hurry up and let me see what new tricks you've got. If you can beat me, I'll return Feng Nü to you. Otherwise, same old rules: whip me up a full seven-element grand meal.\"\n\n  \"Hmph. Fatty, you'd better be careful. This time, I'm afraid you won't be getting your seven-element grand meal; you'll be leaving your life here instead.\" From within the clouds, a figure in a gray cloth robe slowly walked over. It was a young man who looked to be in his twenties. Long golden hair was draped over his back, and his face, handsome enough to make women jealous, was veiled in a faint chill. His blue eyes, clear as lake water, stared calmly ahead. He wasn't looking at the fatty; his gaze was fixed on the seven brilliantly shining gemstones, as if they were his entire life.\n\n  The fatty gave a mischievous laugh. \"That depends on your skill. You should know, a fatty will fight to the death for a good meal. As they say: Shredded meat is precious, sliced meat is dearer, but for a great hunk of meat, both can be cast aside.¹ Come on, come on! The grease in my belly should be enough to fuel one more round with you.\"\n\n  The golden-haired young man sighed. \"Fatty, why must you make things so difficult for me? Return Feng Nü to me, and at worst, I'll cook you a seven-element grand meal every day for a month straight. If you don't let me see Feng Nü, then today, even if I have to risk it all and use life magic, I will leave you here.\"\n\n  The fatty pinched his fleshy chin. \"That won't do. If your heart has nothing to yearn for, the food you make is lacking in flavor. After tasting the best, how can you expect me to eat something second-rate? To be honest, your talent is the greatest I've ever seen. To have cultivated magic to your level... it truly impresses me!\"\n\n  The young man gave a bitter smile. \"It's not like you don't know. I practice magic not to be a magician, but to be able to cook more delicious dishes. Besides, the most I can manage is eighth-level magic.\"\n\n  The fatty shook his head. \"It's not the same. Although you can only cast up to eighth-level magic, your control and understanding of it are unparalleled even by those so-called Magisters. Tell me, which of them can achieve Ice and Fire of the Same Origin, and use that power to draw upon the source of the other five elements—wind, earth, space, light, and darkness? Even if they are just auxiliary, you are still the first all-element magician on the entire continent. I remember they call you the Ice and Fire Magic Chef. Indeed, the root of your power lies in ice and fire; that title suits you perfectly. Haha, I'm going to eat well again today!\"\n\n  A cold glint flared in the golden-haired young man's eyes. He frowned. \"So, we still have to fight then.\"\n\n  The fatty laughed. \"Of course, of course! I'm still waiting for your seven-element grand meal. Just like before, I'll give you time to chant your spell. Go on. A little pre-meal exercise is actually quite nice. I seem to have gotten fatter again recently.\"\n\n  The golden-haired young man's gaze changed, becoming exceptionally resolute. From start to finish, his eyes remained fixed on the seven exposed gemstones. \"We've known each other for quite some time, yet I've never introduced you to my eating utensils. They are my closest friends.\"\n\n  The fatty said with some curiosity, \"That's right! I really haven't heard you talk about them. These seven knives, each one is stranger than the last. Go on, tell me about them.\"\n\n  The golden-haired young man's eyes filled with a fanatical light. \"The Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess—Morning Dew.\" With a soft hum, the blue light suddenly flared, and the water element on the mountaintop grew noticeably stronger.\n\n  \"The Roar of the Flame God—True Sun Blade.\" The red light shone.\n\n  \"The Murmur of the Free Wind—Sky-Proud Blade.\" The cyan light shone.\n\n  \"The Melody of the Awakening Earth—Longevity Blade.\" The yellow light shone.\n\n  \"The Myriad Machinations of the Hexagram—Jade Star Blade.\" The silver light shone.\n\n  \"The Dawn that Pierces Heaven and Earth—Holy Radiance Blade.\" The white light shone.\n\n  \"The Curse of the Eternal Hells—Demon-Devouring Blade.\" The black light shone.\n\n  The seven-colored lights flared brilliantly, weaving together into a splendid, rainbow-like display. A smile appeared on the golden-haired young man's face. Looking at the seven lights, he said, \"They are the Seven Divine Blades. They are also magic staves that condense the seven elements of ice, fire, wind, earth, space, light, and darkness. Most importantly, they are all my kitchen knives.\"\n\n  The smile on the fatty's face suddenly vanished, replaced by a solemn expression. He could clearly feel that this time, the young man's aura was distinctly different from before. A faint golden light appeared on his body—it was the pinnacle of battle qi: Divine Battle Qi. Leaning his upper body slightly forward, his large, fat form, now enveloped in golden light, looked like a solid heavy sword. Yes, he was a Sword Saint, the highest title for a martial artist.\n\n  The light in the golden-haired young man's eyes erupted. He raised his hands, and his long, nimble fingers, guided by his forearms, rapidly drew two hexagrams in front of him—one red, one blue—which looked exceptionally vivid. \"Oh, Goddess of Ice and Snow, grant me the ice of eternal frost! Oh, God of Flame, grant me the fire of the phoenix's nirvana! In my name, O extremes of ice and fire, merge!\" The seven gemstones on the seven knives lit up simultaneously. The red and blue lights entwined and shot towards the golden-haired young man, pulling the other five colors along with them.\n\n  The seven-colored light enveloped the young man's body. Using the red and blue hexagrams as a catalyst, it formed a strange, all-element barrier. A peculiar smile appeared in the young man's eyes as he said to the fatty, \"Let me have you try my newly researched special magic: All-Element • Shadow Puppet.\"\n\n  ...\n\n***\n¹ A parody of a famous poem by Hungarian poet Sándor Petőfi, which is well-known in China. The original reads: \"Life is dear, love is dearer. But for freedom, I would flee them both.\" The fatty has replaced \"life,\" \"love,\" and \"freedom\" with increasingly desirable cuts of meat.",

    "content": "The scorching sun was like fire. A tall, imposing man walked slowly forward, leading a child by the hand. The man wore a fiery red magic robe, and the golden flame embroidered on his chest signified his status as a Magus. Long, golden hair draped over his back, and his bronze face was sharply chiseled, as if carved by knife and axe. His brown eyes, however, held a hint of faint sorrow.\n\n\"Nian Bing, are you tired?\" the man asked, looking down at the child whose hand he held.\n\nThe boy was only as tall as the man's waist. He bore a strong resemblance to the man, though his facial features were much softer. He had the same golden hair, and though still young, his handsome appearance was even more eye-catching than the man's. He had watery-blue eyes and a body that looked somewhat frail. His face was pale with fatigue, with faint traces of sweat at his temples.\n\nHe shook his head firmly. \"Father, I'm not tired. Are we going to see Mother soon? I... I miss Mother so much.\"\n\nThe tall man looked up at the scorching sun in the sky; the blinding light seemed to have no effect on him whatsoever. \"Yes! We're about to see your mother. It's been ten years, and you're ten years old now. For ten years, in this vast world, there has been no place for the two of us. No matter what, I must see your mother this time, even if it costs me my life.\"\n\nNian Bing, being just a child, looked at his father with some confusion. \"Father, why won't they let us see Mother?\"\n\nThe tall man snorted coldly, his eyes looking as if they were about to spew fire. \"Them... Hmph, them. Nian Bing, you're still young. When you grow up, you'll understand. For your mother, Father can sacrifice anything, but I really can't bear to part with you! You're still so small. When we get to the village ahead, will you stay there and wait for Father, please?\"\n\n\"No, Father, I want to go with you to find Mother. Mother has already abandoned me, are you going to abandon me too?\" The rims of Nian Bing's eyes reddened, and he gripped his father's large hand tightly, fearing he would be left behind.\n\nThe tall man took a scroll from his robes and passed it to Nian Bing. \"Do you remember how I taught you to activate a magic scroll? You can come with me, but if we're in grave danger, you must remember to use this scroll. It will send you to a safe place—the one where Father drew the magic circle the day before yesterday.\"\n\nNian Bing took the magic scroll and nodded obediently. \"I understand, Father.\"\n\nThe tall man sighed. \"It's a pity time is so short. Your innate talent is even better than mine. If time allowed me to teach you more, you might have become the most exceptional fire mage on the entire continent. But time does not permit me to wait any longer. If we can't reach the Ice God's Fortress by tomorrow, we will never see your mother again.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, only half-understanding. \"Father, in the future, I will definitely become a powerful fire mage just like you.\"\n\nA hazy look appeared in the tall man's eyes. \"I remember back when your mother and I were together, we discussed what kind of magic we should have our child practice. She was an ice mage, and I am a fire mage. Ice and fire are incompatible, so our child could only choose one. Back then, your mother said that if we had a boy, he would learn fire magic from me, and if we had a girl, she would learn ice magic from her. Thinking of it now, it's as if she's right here before me. Her words still echo in my ears, but she is gone.\"\n\nAt this, his voice suddenly rose with intensity. \"I, Rong Tian, the Fire Magus, swear I will stop the succession ceremony of the Ice Goddess's Priestess and take back my wife!\"\n\n...\n\nThree days later.\n\nIt was a mountain peak about a hundred meters high. The peak was steep, and though not tall, it gave off a sharp, imposing feeling. The greyish-green mountain had a grim, austere look; while some plants grew on it, they were extremely sparse, perhaps due to the steepness of the terrain. Other than those who walked the foothills year-round, an ordinary person would find it very difficult to climb such a precipitous peak. At the foot of the mountain, a great river surged from south to north. This was a famous mother river of the Yang Guang Continent, known as the Tianqing River. The river traversed nearly two-thirds of the Yang Guang Continent, stretching for almost two thousand kilometers. Its source lay in the northernmost Ice Pole Province, where sixty percent of the province was covered by glaciers. Each spring and summer, the glaciers would melt and flow into the Tianqing River, continuing all the way to the distant sea. The river was wide, nearly a hundred meters across at its narrowest point and several kilometers at its widest. It was named for its clear water and swift currents, nurturing the people of several nations and dozens of provinces. Although occasional flooding brought a certain degree of disaster, thanks to proper management by the various nations, the people living by the river were able to lead peaceful and comfortable lives, dependent on it for their survival.\n\nOn the steep mountain peak, whose surface area was less than ten square meters, a fiery red light suddenly appeared. It began as a single point of light, which moved rapidly, in the blink of an eye outlining a red hexagram. The temperature on the peak rose sharply, and watery ripples formed in the air above the hexagram from the scorching heat.\n\nThe ripples trembled gently, and the red light flared. The surrounding magical elements seemed to be chirping cheerfully. In the midst of the intense elemental fluctuations, a grey figure appeared silently.\n\nThe figure staggered, tumbling out of the fiery red magic circle, nearly falling to the ground. It was a child, a boy who looked to be about ten years old. He was none other than Rong Nian Bing, who had been searching for his mother with his father three days prior.\n\nHis small, handsome face was filled with terror. His short golden hair was a mess. His legs gave way, and he collapsed onto the ground, panting heavily. \"Father, Mother, why... why did it have to be this way?\" Tears streamed ceaselessly down his face. The pain of losing his closest family was difficult for anyone to bear, let alone a child of only ten.\n\nAfter crying for a while, the mentally exhausted Nian Bing curled up behind a rock on the mountaintop and fell into a deep sleep. At his young age, his future was a blur; he had no idea what he should do. Faint blue and red lights flashed from his chest before vanishing. The surrounding fire and ice elements quickly gathered towards his small body. This strange process lasted for about the time it takes to eat a meal before quietly disappearing.\n\nAn unknown amount of time later, a violent jolt and a sharp pain woke Nian Bing from his slumber. Three tall, slender figures were standing not far in front of him. The intense pain in his chest made him cough, and a trickle of blood ran down the corner of his mouth. On the chest of his grey cloth tunic was a dusty footprint.\n\nThe three men all wore blue magic robes, which seemed to merge with their long blue hair, as if their bodies were formed from ice, giving off an indescribable coldness. They appeared to be in their thirties or forties. On the left breast of the central figure's robe were three snowflakes carved from fingernail-sized blue crystals. The two flanking him, clearly lower in rank, had only one.\n\n\"A teleportation magic circle scroll, based on fire. A pity it was used by a child; the residual aura is too obvious,\" the central mage said faintly.\n\nSeeing these three men, Nian Bing's handsome little face instantly contorted. \"You... Ah! It's you, you villains! Give me back my mother, give me back my father!\" With strength from some unknown source, Nian Bing managed to scramble up from the ground and charge at the man in the middle. At that moment, he had forgotten his abilities as a novice mage; in his impulsive rage, there was only instinct.\n\n\"Little bastard, are you looking to die?\" The mage on the left waved his right hand, and a water bullet three inches in diameter shot out instantly, slamming directly into the boy's chest. The water bullet was only the most common level-one spell and didn't have much attack power. Nian Bing grunted, staggering back a few steps and falling to the ground. His hand, which he used to steady himself, was scraped and bloodied by the nearby rocks.\n\nThe mage in the center shot his companion a glare. \"That's enough. He's just a child. I don't want him to suffer too much.\"\n\n\"Yes, respected Lord Ice and Snow Priest,\" the mage who had attacked replied, hastily stepping back.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Priest looked at Nian Bing and said dispassionately, \"Child, I did not wish to harm you. However, you are their child. For the dignity of the Ice God's Tower, you cannot be allowed to exist. Hand over the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess, and I will give you a quick death.\" Given his status, he naturally wouldn't search the boy himself, but his commanding tone radiated an intangible authority.",

    "content": "*Author's Note: This is the second chapter for today. For those who have finished reading the other one, you can come over here now. To all the brothers and sisters who support Xiao San, please add this to your collection and vote. Thank you.*\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Author's Note: I uploaded the wrong chapter just now, my sincere apologies.*\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNian Bing slowly stood up. At his young age, a cold, sharp light glinted in his eyes, and a deep hatred burned in his heart. \"The dignity of the Ice God Pagoda? Father said that the outwardly glamorous Ice God Pagoda is nothing but a pile of trash. You want the Ice and Snow Goddess's Stone back? In your dreams. I wouldn't give it to you even if I died. It's the last thing Mother gave me. All of you can just die.\" Without any warning, he thrust both fists forward. A red light from his left and a blue one from his right, each carrying a different aura, shot toward the three Ice Mages before him. They were a fireball and a water ball, two level-one spells that could be cast without an incantation. Even he hadn't expected to conjure ice and fire at the same time.\n\nA glint flashed in the Ice Priest's eyes. He quickly chanted a few simple characters, and a soft water wall materialized out of thin air. The collision of water and fire produced a cloud of steam. A thought suddenly struck him, and he knew something was wrong. By the time he tried to act again, it was already too late.\n\nThe small body plummeted from the mountain's peak. In the moment he leaped from the cliff, there was not a trace of hesitation. With a splash, his figure vanished into the turbulent river, creating only the faintest of ripples. Nian Bing's voice still echoed in the ears of the three Ice Mages; they finally understood what he meant by not surrendering the Ice and Snow Goddess's Stone even in death.\n\nThe Ice Priest took a few steps forward to the cliff's edge and let out a soft sigh. \"What a fiercely resolute child.\"\n\n\"Lord Ice Priest, how is this possible? How old is he? How can he instantly cast two spells? And conflicting ones at that,\" the Ice Mage on the left said, staring in astonishment at the rushing river below.\n\nThe Ice Priest said coolly, \"It's not because his magic power is high, but because he not only has Uncle-Master Bing's Ice and Snow Goddess's Stone, but also Rong Tian's Flame God's Stone. Although he cannot yet use the true power of these two supreme gems, it's not surprising that he can trigger simple, low-level spells. However, ice and fire are mutually destructive, yet the two low-level spells he used simultaneously did not seem to conflict with each other. This is something I truly don't understand. It seems this child has an extremely high talent for magic.\"\n\nThe mage on the right said hatefully, \"Unfortunately, we don't have enough magic power to freeze this turbulent river, otherwise we could definitely obtain those two precious gems. Lord Ice Priest, what about our mission? We should have just searched him directly earlier.\"\n\nThe Ice Priest glanced at him, and the chill in his eyes sent a shiver down the mage's entire body, silencing him from saying another word.\n\n\"Remember, to cultivate magic, you must first cultivate the heart. Without a calm heart, your magical abilities will never reach the highest realm. This mission has ended in failure. I will bear all responsibility. Let's go back. Oh, great Ice and Snow Goddess! Please lend me your fury, and deliver us to the lost shore.\" At some point, a meter-long magic staff had appeared in his hand. Its body was a crystalline blue, made of some unknown material. At its head, eight ethereal fingers, like stars paying homage to the moon, extended in the manner of a demon's eight claws to grasp a transparent gem.\n\nThe staff was raised slowly. The ice elements in the air gradually grew violent, and the sky darkened along with them. What was the fury of the Ice and Snow Goddess? It was an Ice Storm.\n\nIce Storm, a level-six, large-area ice magic spell with ordinary attack power but an extremely wide range.\n\nSnowflakes danced in the air, causing the temperature to plummet. This was the environment Ice Mages loved most. In the dim sky, amidst the raging blizzard, the Ice Priest pointed his staff forward. \"Let's go.\"\n\nThe two Ice Mages acknowledged the command. Enveloped in a faint blue light, they floated up like snowflakes, drifting with the blizzard toward the Ice God Pagoda. The Ice Storm was perfectly suited for Ice Mages to perform short-distance flight. Though they couldn't fly continuously like Wind Mages, their speed over short distances was several degrees faster.\n\nAfter his companions had left, the Ice Priest, Bing Lu, cast a final glance at the wide Azure River. He sighed softly. \"Let it all be decided by the heavens. Uncle-Master Bing, this is all I can do for you.\" With his level of magic, he could have easily killed Nian Bing as he fled. However, a念 of kindness¹ in his heart stopped him from doing so, leaving a final chance of survival for the poor, orphaned child.\n\n...\n\nZha Ji walked out of the Peach Blossom Forest toward the bank of the Azure River. He glanced at the fishing net in his hand and muttered to himself, \"Time to improve my diet a bit. Eating vegetables every day... no matter how delicious, my body is still lacking nutrients. I'll net a few azure fish to nourish this old body of mine.\"\n\nThe fresh air was slightly humid. Breathing it in felt exceptionally comfortable to him. Zha Ji, already fifty-seven, had lived here for ten years and was more than familiar with his surroundings.\n\nWith trembling hands, he managed to grip the fishing net firmly. Using his arm to lead his hand, he cast the net out. Although it only landed four or five meters away, for the bountiful Azure River, as long as he was patient, he would certainly not return empty-handed. He secured the net nearby, tied one of the lines to his wrist, and sat down against a large tree. Seeking shade under a tree was indeed a good choice in the hot summer.\n\nHe had just settled in when the line on his wrist suddenly gave a sharp tug. His closed eyes snapped open, a glint flashing through them. \"My luck can't be this good, can it? Usually, I have to wait a while for a catch. Oh no, it's not a fish. My poor fishing net!\" When his gaze fell upon the river, what he saw was a piece of wood. It wasn't large, about a meter long and as thick as a human leg, and it was tangled in his not-so-sturdy fishing net. He didn't even need to look closely to know that this net was probably ruined.\n\nBefore Zha Ji could even lament his wretched luck, he noticed a pair of slender arms on the log. There was someone—someone in the river. Wasting no time, he quickly wound the line around his leg and strode further away from the bank, using the strength of his legs to pull the log, and the person with it, to shore.\n\n\"No—\" Nian Bing shot up, gasping for breath, his eyes filled with a look of bewildered shock.\n\nThe chirping of birds reached his ears clearly. Soft light shone on his body, bringing a bit of warmth. He shook his head forcefully, his mind steadying slightly. From the warmth he felt, he knew he wasn't dead. His heartbeat gradually calmed, and he observed his surroundings. It seemed to be a small wooden hut. Besides the bed he was on, there didn't seem to be much other furniture. There was a fair amount of dust in the room, a clear sign it wasn't cleaned often.\n\n\"You're awake.\" A tired voice sounded. The wooden door opened with a cringe-inducing creak, and a person walked in from outside.\n\nNian Bing instinctively curled up. \"Who... who are you?\"\n\n\"The one who saved your life.\" Zha Ji walked to the bedside and sat down, placing a bowl he was holding on the wooden table nearby. He smiled as he looked at Nian Bing, thinking to himself: *What a handsome child.*\n\nMemories of the past few days' events flooded his mind. Nian Bing's whole body trembled slightly. He subconsciously felt his chest; the hard objects were still there. Only then did he let out a sigh of relief. He asked tentatively, \"You saved me?\" As he spoke, he sized up the old man before him. He looked to be in his sixties, his black hair flecked with white, and the wrinkles on his face told of the hardships of time. He had a kind smile on his very ordinary-looking face.\n\nZha Ji said, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, \"Of course it was me. Who else did you think it would be? You were lucky to have held onto that log. Do you have any idea how much effort it took me to get you back here? It really tired this old man out. Here, little one, eat something. That broken log of yours ruined my fishing net, so all I have is vegetable congee.\"\n\nIn his earlier state of fright, Nian Bing hadn't paid much attention to his body. Now, hearing Zha Ji tell him to eat, he realized his stomach was practically stuck to his spine. Back then, after leaping into the Azure River, the sharp pain from hitting the water had nearly made him pass out. Flailing his arms, he had miraculously grabbed a log after being washed several hundred meters downstream. An intense will to live made him cling tightly to it. It was his good fortune that the Azure River was extremely wide and lacked any protruding reefs, allowing him to be rescued after bumping into Zha Ji's fishing net.\n\nHe looked at Zha Ji with some caution before picking up the bowl of congee, from which no aroma seemed to emanate. When he saw the contents of the bowl, he couldn't help but be taken aback. The white congee was extremely thick and seemed to shimmer with a faint, crystalline luster. Chunks of green vegetables, though not uniform in size, were scattered throughout the white congee, and he could almost feel the life force they contained. Closer up, the entire bowl gave off a light, fresh fragrance that made his appetite stir. Little did he know that this ordinary-looking bowl of vegetable congee was known in the continent's culinary world as \"Jadeite and White Jade Congee,\" something no ordinary person could ever hope to taste. The key was not in the ingredients, but in the method of preparation.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **善念 (shànniàn):** A thought of kindness, benevolence, or compassion.

    "content": "To the brothers and sisters who support Xiao San, please add this to your favorites and vote. Thank you. There will be another chapter before 8 PM tonight.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe sweet aroma of the white congee, mixed with the freshness of the green vegetables—the two different scents blended together perfectly. After finishing a bowl of the congee, Nian Bing felt as if some of his strength had returned, and even his spirits had lifted. The simple vegetable congee left a lingering fragrance on his lips and palate. The extreme satisfaction of his sense of taste made him feel a growing fondness for Zha Ji.\n\n\"Grandpa, thank you. This congee is so delicious. Did you make it?\" Nian Bing asked curiously.\n\nA look of sorrow flashed across Zha Ji's eyes. \"Nowadays, I can only make this kind of simple fare.\"\n\n\"Simple? How could it be? This vegetable congee is the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. The flavor is truly wonderful. Even... even the meals my mother used to make were definitely no match for this.\" At the mention of his mother, Nian Bing's eyes couldn't help but redden. A powerful hatred emanated from him, secretly startling Zha Ji, who was beside him.\n\n\"Little friend, I still don't know your name. And why did you fall into the water? Where are your parents?\"\n\nNian Bing’s whole body stiffened. Although he was only ten, he had been constantly on the move with his father for the past few years and was much more mature than other children his age. His father had once told him the principle of only ever telling a person a fraction of the truth. He had learned that lesson profoundly two years ago, when an accidental slip of the tongue had subjected him and his father to a month-long pursuit. He lowered his head and said, \"I think my name is Nian Bing. I can’t remember anything else.\"\n\nNian Bing was, after all, only ten. How could such words be believable to the worldly-wise Zha Ji? However, Zha Ji didn't press him. With a faint smile, he said, \"My name is Zha Ji. You can call me Grandpa Zha. You say you've forgotten everything, so do you have anywhere to go?\"\n\nNian Bing fought back his tears and shook his head. \"I... I don't know where to go either.\"\n\nSeeing his sorrowful expression, Zha Ji felt a pang of pity. \"Never mind, child. I know you must have some secret you're unwilling to share. Grandpa won't force you. If you're willing, you can stay here for now. After all, I'm the only one in this peach blossom forest.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes flew open, and he said firmly, \"No, thank you, Grandpa Zha, but I must leave. You saved me, I can't bring trouble upon you.\"\n\nZha Ji's brow furrowed slightly. \"So, someone is hunting you. Who could be so cruel as to not even spare a child as young as you? In your sleep, you kept calling for your father and mother. Could it be that your parents have met with disaster?\"\n\nThe tears could no longer be held back and streamed down his face. Nian Bing burst into tears. Zha Ji quickly pulled him into his arms, comforting him, \"There, there, it's all in the past now. You must have been terrified. This place of mine is very secret, and it's a so-called forbidden land, so people don't usually come here. You should stay and rest for now. At least wait until you've recovered before thinking about leaving. Sleep a while longer. Tonight, Grandpa will make you something good to eat.\" Soothed by Zha Ji, Nian Bing once again drifted off to sleep.\n\nWhen the ten-year-old Nian Bing awoke from his slumber again, his mind had completely stabilized. The sunlight that had previously streamed in through the window was gone. The birds, too, seemed to have returned to their nests to rest, and all around was silent.\n\nClimbing out of bed, Nian Bing found himself dressed in a loose-fitting coarse cloth robe, clearly belonging to Zha Ji. He moved his body a bit and found that he didn't feel so exhausted anymore. He tiptoed to the door, opened it, and stepped out. It was pitch black outside, impossible to make out the scenery. A night mist filled the air, bringing with it a chill. He subconsciously tightened the robe around himself and walked toward another room nearby that had a light on. His foot accidentally bumped into something, making a soft noise.\n\n\"Is that you, Nian Bing? Come in,\" Zha Ji's voice came from the room.\n\nNian Bing pushed the door open and entered. It was a wooden cabin, slightly larger than his own. Zha Ji was holding a book, reading under a bright oil lamp. Seeing him enter, Zha Ji said, \"Come, Grandpa will take you to the kitchen. I've already prepared everything; it just needs to be heated up.\"\n\nIt was only then that Nian Bing realized Zha Ji was extremely tall, though his back was already somewhat stooped. With an arm around Nian Bing's narrow shoulders, Zha Ji led him out of the room. As they walked, he said, \"I'm the only one living in this small courtyard. With you here for company, I suppose I won't be so lonely anymore. Come, let's see what delicious food Grandpa has prepared for you.\"\n\nThe kitchen was a separate room located five meters away from the two bedrooms. When Nian Bing followed Zha Ji there, he was surprised to discover that the kitchen was even larger than his room and Zha Ji's room combined.\n\nZha Ji lit an oil lamp. On a nearby counter sat several dishes covered by a wooden mesh dome. The dome was woven from rattan, and through the gaps, one could see that the plates clearly held vegetable dishes.\n\nZha Ji lifted the cover, revealing four small plates of greens. They were four different kinds of green vegetables, all of which looked to be simply prepared. Zha Ji walked over to the stove and crouched down. He took out a flint and, with trembling hands, tried to strike a spark on the uneven firewood. \"I made the dishes a while ago, so they've unfortunately gotten cold. We'll heat them up. Although the flavor will be a bit off, I imagine it won't be too bad.\"\n\nNian Bing was surprised to see that Zha Ji's hands were trembling constantly. Although the flint sparked as he struck it, his hands were so unsteady that he was having great difficulty lighting the wood. Nian Bing obediently walked over and said, \"Grandpa, let me help you.\"\n\nZha Ji sighed, and a look of sorrow once again washed over his face. He passed the flint to Nian Bing. \"I'm old. I'm really getting old. I should have just used the oil lamp. Who would have thought that the Ghost Chef¹ of the past would now be unable to even light a fire? It’s all in the past now.\"\n\nNian Bing didn't take the flint, nor did he pay attention to Zha Ji’s words. His mind was completely focused. In a low voice, he said, \"Oh, passionate elements of fire, I ask you to gather into the light of a flame and bring warmth to the world.\" His voice wasn't steady; it was uttered in a special tone, one that created resonance. He reached his small hand toward the stove, and a small ball of red flame rose up. Although the light wasn’t very bright, the kindling in the stove caught the open flame and immediately began to burn.\n\nZha Ji stared at Nian Bing, dumbfounded, and mumbled, \"Magic... that's fire magic. Great heavens! Did you send this child to me specifically? Thank you, thank you, I finally have hope. This is wonderful.\" He cheered incoherently, leaving Nian Bing, who was standing beside him, a bit stunned. At that moment, Zha Ji's stooped back seemed to straighten as he stood tall, cheering excitedly at the ceiling.\n\n\"Grandpa, Grandpa Zha, what's wrong with you?\"\n\nZha Ji came back to his senses and grabbed Nian Bing's shoulders excitedly. \"Child, you're a mage, aren't you? Quick, tell Grandpa, you're a fire mage.\"\n\nNian Bing trembled. Only then did he realize that in a moment of impulse, he had revealed his magical abilities. He shook his head forcefully. \"No, I'm not. I... I'm not.\"\n\n\"No, you are,\" Zha Ji said with certainty. \"Child, don't worry, Grandpa has no ill intentions toward you. I'm just so happy. You're so young, and yet you're already a mage. This is a gift from the heavens!\"\n\nNian Bing seemed to see the scene at the Ice God Pagoda again and shouted agitatedly, \"No, I'm not! I'm not!\"\n\nZha Ji then realized that Nian Bing, who had only just recovered from his terror, couldn't handle his stimulation. He quickly said, \"Child, listen to me. Just listen to me first, alright? Look at my hands.\" With that, he released Nian Bing and turned his hands upward, revealing his wrists.\n\nNian Bing was drawn in by Zha Ji’s words and subconsciously looked at his wrists. \"Ah—\" On each of Zha Ji's wrists was a scar, about a centimeter deep. Although the wounds had long since healed, the scars remained, shockingly prominent. The entire wound was concave, a purplish-black color that was terrifying to behold.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Ghost Chef (鬼廚):** A title, suggesting a chef of legendary or supernatural skill.",

Everyone is welcome to add it to your collection and vote for it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nZha Ji gave a wry smile. \"What could an old man like me, with severed tendons in both hands, possibly do to you?\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Zha Ji, the fear in his eyes subsiding a little. He asked tentatively, \"Grandpa, you... why are your hands like that?\"\n\nZha Ji pulled Nian Bing to sit down and sighed sadly. \"Let Grandpa tell you a story. A story about something that happened to me. After you hear it, you'll understand why I was so excited when I saw you use magic.\" As he spoke, he gazed out at the deep darkness beyond the door, his eyes growing distant.\n\n\"Our Yang Guang Continent, after nearly three hundred years of warfare, entered a period of stability about seventy years ago. The five great empires gradually formed, carving up the entire continent. With the exception of a few special places, all the land was drawn into their territories. After being tempered by three hundred years of war, the people needed to rest and recuperate. For the past several decades, industry and agriculture have been developing. Although the five empires have occasional disputes, they have been relatively at peace with one another.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"The five great empires you're talking about are the Aolan Empire in the east, the Qilu Empire in the southeast, the Huarong Empire in the southwest, the Langmu Empire in the northwest, and the Ice Moon Empire in the north, right?\"\n\nZha Ji nodded. \"That's right, those five empires. I was born in the Qilu Empire in the southeast. When I was a child, my family was very poor; we couldn't even afford fine grains. I remember asking my mother when we could eat our fill of steamed buns,¹ and she would just hold me and cry. I remember it clearly to this day. Back then, my greatest wish was to eat delicious food every day and to be able to cook the best meals for my mother. Later, I kept working tirelessly toward that goal. Unfortunately, my parents passed away in an epidemic before I was able to provide for them. Perhaps Heaven took pity on me. When I was thirteen, I met my master. Because my family was poor, I was sent to a restaurant as an apprentice at a very young age, which was exactly what I wanted. My master was the head chef of that restaurant. In order to learn the culinary arts I yearned for, I was extremely diligent, trying to please everyone in the restaurant. Our restaurant was called Strange Fragrance, one of the most famous in the Qilu Empire. Seeing that I was diligent enough, my master began to teach me some simple cooking techniques. I wasn't particularly smart, but I was very hardworking. As the saying goes, diligence can make up for a lack of talent. After three years of relentless effort, I was finally promoted from a miscellaneous helper to a food prep position. One day, my master called me to a quiet place. He told me that to become a good chef, diligence alone wasn't enough; one also needed insight, to use your heart to feel the dishes you make. Cooking isn't a simple job, but a profound art. He taught me eight words to live by: 'Ten years to practice cooking, ten years to understand cooking.' I remember those eight words to this day. Through constant effort and comprehension, when I was twenty-three, my culinary skills finally reached a high level of mastery. But my master passed away from illness that year. I always remembered my master's eight-word instruction, so I gave up the opportunity to inherit his position at the Strange Fragrance Restaurant, resigned from all my duties, and with my kitchen knife and meager savings, I set out on my own journey. I wanted to travel all over the Yang Guang Continent to learn the culinary arts of every country and every region.\"\n\nAs he said this, Zha Ji's eyes shone brightly, as if he had returned to his former glory. He sighed with emotion, \"Ten years. Another ten years, a decade that truly allowed me to comprehend the essence of cooking. In those ten years, I traveled to nearly every famous restaurant, exchanging techniques with the head chefs of each one. Through my own understanding, I finally created my own unique skills. Later, because my cooking had reached a divine level, people gave me the nickname 'Ghost Chef.' I achieved the glorious record of five consecutive championships in the God of Cooking competition. The dishes I made became a symbol of that era. The imperial palaces of all five empires extended an olive branch to me, hoping I would serve as their Head Imperial Chef. However, I always felt my skills were not yet perfect enough, so I continued to explore, hoping to elevate my craft to an even higher realm. Progressing through constant exploration—it was a wonderful feeling, especially whenever I created a peerless dish. That sense of accomplishment was incomparable to anything else. I dedicated my entire life to the culinary arts, and by the time I was forty-seven, I remained unmarried.\"\n\nAt this, Zha Ji paused and looked at Nian Bing, who was listening intently. He smiled slightly. \"Surprising, isn't it? That a withered old man like me had a glorious side.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment. Although Zha Ji spoke calmly, Nian Bing's keen senses could detect a thick undercurrent of sorrow in his grandfather's tone. \"Grandpa, what happened next? What happened after that?\"\n\nZha Ji gave a wry smile. \"Later... frankly, I truly don't want to recall what happened then, but now I have no choice but to remember. My forty-seventh year was an important turning point in my life, and the year I fell from the clouds. Perhaps because I had lived for over forty years without ever experiencing something like love, that year, I fell madly in love with a woman. She was so beautiful, so lively and cheerful. Her every movement, every frown and every smile, made my heart tremble. She was only twenty-four at the time, and I was more than twice her age, but I still fell for her without a second thought. She was also a chef, but a very different kind from me. She only made exquisite pastries and worked as a pastry chef in a restaurant at the time. That was the restaurant where I stayed the longest. After a long period of consideration, I decided to confess my feelings to her. Although I didn't dare hope she would accept, I still wanted to tell her how I felt.\"\n\nNian Bing asked, \"So, did she accept?\"\n\nZha Ji shook his head. \"She didn't say yes, and she didn't say no. After listening to my confession, she proposed a condition. She wanted to compete with me in cooking. If I won, she would marry me. If I lost, I would have to retire from the culinary world, and all the fame I possessed would become hers.\"\n\nNian Bing furrowed his brow, a strange expression on his handsome young face. \"Grandpa, I think she was using you. She knew you were the strongest chef, yet she still dared to make such a demand. She must have been confident about something. Besides, making a demand like that, she clearly didn't have good intentions. How could she genuinely want to marry you?\"\n\nZha Ji smiled. \"What a clever child. Yes, I was indeed being used. But at that time, I was blinded by my emotions. I didn't think too much about it and agreed in an instant. After all, having stood at the pinnacle of the culinary world for so many years had long since given me a certain arrogance. It had been a long time since I had competed with anyone, because no one would dare challenge me. Even at the God of Cooking competition, I only served as a judge. Since she wanted to compete against me in what I did best, I naturally had no reason to refuse. And so, a competition that I can never forget, even to this day, began.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment before continuing, \"To make her accept her defeat completely, I decided to make my six most famous signature dishes. We invited the eighteen most famous chefs in the culinary world to be our judges. My skills had already reached the point of perfection. In my hands, six complex and famous dishes were completed in just one hour. My years of understanding the culinary arts made me extremely satisfied with the dishes I had created; they were almost alive. But strangely, she stood before her pile of ingredients without moving. When my six dishes were done and I looked over at her, she said to me, 'You made so many. I will only make one dish. For a masterpiece, one is enough.' As she spoke, she moved. Without any flashy movements or skilled knife work, she simply picked up a strip of meat, swiftly tossed it into the air, and chanted something in a strange tone. A blue flame shot up to the sky and engulfed the strip of meat. A flash of white light from a knife streaked through the air. When the meat landed on the plate, it had already been cut into thirteen pieces, glistening golden-brown. It was only then that I realized she was actually a magician. And a very powerful fire magician at that. Even so, I still thought I had won. Judging by appearance and aroma, she was far behind. But I soon realized I was wrong. When I personally tasted that golden-brown meat, an unprecedented sensation flooded my sense of taste. The meat had not been processed in any way beforehand, nor had any seasonings been added during its preparation, but she had completely released its natural fragrance. The thirteen pieces, although lacking the familiar flavors of sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, or salty, each contained thirteen distinct sections, each with a different intensity of flavor. The aroma created by the combination of these flavors was far more delicious than any seasoned dish. The moment I took a bite, I knew I had lost. And lost miserably. Although in terms of taste, my six dishes were by no means inferior to her meat, my culinary art, when compared to hers, had fallen to a lower level. It wasn't just because of the speed, but more importantly, because of the innovation.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  `窩頭` (wōtóu): A type of steamed bun, typically conical, made from coarse flours like cornmeal or millet.

    "content": "\"No,\" Nian Bing said suddenly. \"Grandpa, you're wrong. Actually, she was just being clever. To make that strip of meat, she must have pushed her magical control to the absolute limit. It was simply her understanding of the meat itself, combined with varying degrees of combustion from fire magic, that naturally produced that peculiar flavor. If you also knew magic, what you made would surely have been far better than hers.\" His father had told him many times that while the magnitude of one's magical power was important, control over that magic was equally crucial. Good magical control could make the same amount of power produce a far stronger effect.\n\nZha Ji sighed and said, \"Yes, others told me the same later on. But in that situation, as a man, a loss is a loss. She asked me if the wager still stood. I said, of course it did. And so, I announced in front of everyone that I was giving her the title of 'Ghost Chef.' At the same time, with my own kitchen knife, I severed the tendons in my hand to show I was leaving the culinary world for good. After that, I came here, and I've lived here for ten years. Now you should understand why I was so agitated when I saw you using magic. If I had known magic back then, my culinary skills would have surely reached a new realm. If I had known magic, she probably would have already been my wife. What I remember most vividly is the look on her face as I cut my own tendons. What a complex expression! In her beautiful eyes, I saw regret, but what good was that? For the sake of my own dignity, I had to do it. No one could change my mind. The Ghost Chef, Zha Ji, vanished from the culinary stage that day, and a new Ghost Chef was born. As I was about to leave, she suddenly found me and told me that, in truth, it was the only dish she knew how to make. The reason she had challenged me was because I had once defeated her father in the Culinary God Competition. As her father lay dying, he still couldn't forget that match, and hoped that one day she could best me through culinary arts. Her father's dying wish spurred her efforts, but she was a mage and had never known how to cook before then. She knew perfectly well that surpassing me in culinary skill was almost impossible, which is why she chose the method of infusing magic into her cooking. And so, I lost. I lost everything. At the time, she told me she only wanted to win back her father's honor and had never intended to harm me. I laughed. I told her that none of it mattered anymore, and that the only romance of my entire life had ended in such a tragedy. Leaving her with those words, I departed. After a period of aimless wandering, I finally chose this silent, deserted place to settle down.\"\n\nNian Bing was completely captivated by the story. \"Grandpa, do you regret it?\"\n\nZha Ji shook his head. \"No, I don't regret it. Although I lost everything, I witnessed a new direction for the culinary arts: infusing magic into cooking. Through the refinement of magic, culinary skill can be elevated to another realm. It's a pity that while I know this, I can no longer do it myself, and very few people would even attempt it. After all, what noble mage would be willing to become a lowly cook?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"I understand. You want me to learn the culinary arts from you, to merge my magic with your skills and become a magical chef, is that it?\"\n\nZha Ji reined in his sorrowful emotions and smiled kindly. \"Then, are you willing?\"\n\nNian Bing lowered his head, various complex emotions flickering in his eyes. For a child of only ten, he was certainly thinking about too much; it was just that Zha Ji couldn't see his expression. Soon, Nian Bing made his decision. He lifted his head to look at Zha Ji. \"Grandpa, I'm sorry. I can't.\"\n\nA faint light flashed in Zha Ji's eyes, but it quickly vanished. \"Mm, Grandpa won't force you. Now that you've heard my story, can you let me hear yours? You washed up here, carried by the currents. What brought you here?\"\n\nNian Bing hesitated for a moment, then said, \"Grandpa, you saved my life, so I really shouldn't hide anything from you. My parents were both mages, and we were a happy family. But not long ago, as we were passing a place called Mount Talu in the Ice Moon Empire, we encountered a large group of bandits. They wanted to steal our belongings, and when my parents refused, a fight broke out. As you know, while mages have their powers, the time it takes to chant a spell is their greatest weakness. Although my parents managed to destroy some of the enemies, in the end... in the end...\" At this, Nian Bing broke down and began to sob uncontrollably.\n\nOrdinarily, Zha Ji would have noticed that the weeping Nian Bing was secretly glancing at him. However, he had just finished recounting his own life story and his mind was still immersed in that long-ago competition. That, combined with the dimness of the evening, meant he failed to notice this detail.\n\nThis lie of Nian Bing's contained an element of truth. He and his father had indeed encountered many bandits while passing through Mount Talu who had tried to rob them. However, with his father's magical prowess, dealing with those bandits had been all too easy. Mount Talu was a notorious den of bandits, and for this reason, Zha Ji already believed Nian Bing's words. After all, how wary could a worldly-wise old man be of a mere ten-year-old child?\n\n\"The Ice Moon Empire has always been protected by the Ice God Tower. I really don't know what those mages in there are even doing. The Mount Talu bandits have been a menace for more than a day or two; they should have been completely annihilated long ago. Child, don't be sad. Regardless of whether you want to learn the culinary arts from me, just settle in here for the time being, alright?\"\n\nNian Bing, who now had nowhere to go, nodded lightly. His young heart was filled with hatred. *Ice God Tower, Ice God Tower... one day, I will come for you.*\n\nZha Ji picked up a cup of water from the side, his hand trembling. As his back was turned to Nian Bing, the boy didn't notice a white powder slip from his trembling hand into the cup. He passed the water to Nian Bing. \"Here, child, drink some water first. I'll go heat up the food.\"\n\nWithout a shred of suspicion, Nian Bing accepted and gulped the water down.\n\nZha Ji's expression was complex, as if he were wrestling with some internal conflict. But soon, his resolve hardened.\n\nAfter drinking the water, Nian Bing obediently set the cup aside and stretched. \"Grandpa, why aren't you heating up the food? I'm sure your cooking is delicious.\"\n\nZha Ji sighed. \"I'm sorry, Nian Bing. But I have no other choice. You are my only chance.\"\n\nNian Bing froze for a second. He suddenly felt a wave of dizziness wash over his mind, and his body swayed.\n\nZha Ji looked up at Nian Bing, his voice growing deep and low. \"Look at me, child. Look into my eyes. You are very sleepy... so sleepy. Relax your body. Relax everything. I am the one you trust the most. Sleep... sleep...\"\n\nNian Bing stared into Zha Ji's eyes, and his own gaze gradually grew vacant. Though he remained seated, his face became completely devoid of expression.",

    "content": "Cha Ji bit his finger and drew a circle in the air. “With my blood as a guide, seal away the endless hatred.” A red light flashed, enveloping Nian Bing’s body. He trembled slightly, then grew calm.\n\nCha Ji continued, “Nian Bing, my name is Cha Ji. I am your teacher. From now on, you will forget everything except for your understanding of knowledge, your awareness of the continent, and your knowledge of magic. All that has happened before will become an illusion. From now on, your heart will hold only a devotion to the cultivation of magic and culinary arts. Pursuing the pinnacle of culinary arts will be your life’s greatest goal.”\n\nAt this, Cha Ji paused. Nian Bing mumbled a repetition of his words, his vacant gaze growing even more entranced.\n\nA trace of pity flickered in Cha Ji’s eyes as he went on, “Unless your magic reaches a level sufficient to destroy your enemies, your sealed memories will never be able to awaken. Sleep, child. Sleep well.” As he spoke, Cha Ji gathered Nian Bing into his arms. Nian Bing closed his eyes, and his breathing soon became even.\n\nHolding Nian Bing, Cha Ji sighed. “I never thought the first time I would use the sealing hypnosis I traded a meal for would be on a child. Nian Bing, I’m sorry. Grandpa had no choice. If you were unwilling to learn the culinary arts from me, I’m afraid all my learning would be lost to time. I hope you can understand Grandpa’s difficult intentions. From now on, Grandpa will teach you with all his heart and make you the greatest chef. Perhaps, one day, your memories will reawaken. At that time, even if you hate me, I am willing to bear it. You will not be the me of the past, not the Ghost Chef, but a Magic Chef—a chef who can use magic. You will surpass everything that has come before and reach the true pinnacle of the culinary arts. Perhaps I am too selfish, but if your parents were still alive, they would surely not blame me. Compared to living forever in hatred, how can it compare to the joy of pursuing the culinary arts?”\n\nCha Ji muttered to himself, not noticing that as he spoke the final sentence, a faint wisp of red light quietly vanished from Nian Bing’s right hand, which hung by his side.\n\nLifting Nian Bing’s body, he carried him back to his room and tucked him in. Cha Ji smiled. “Hope has finally arrived. I will absolutely not give up this gift from the heavens. Sleep well, child. Starting tomorrow, you will learn the skills of the Ghost Chef. Haha, hahahaha.” His obsession with the culinary arts made Cha Ji forget everything else. In the last ten years, not a single moment had brought him more joy than this one.\n\nThe door closed. Cha Ji left. Perhaps he, too, would not sleep peacefully tonight.\n\nThe wooden cabin returned to its silence, and everything sank into the thick darkness. Nian Bing, who should have been deep asleep, suddenly sat up. A faint light shone in his blue eyes; it was not a vacant gaze. He seemed to be pondering something.\n\nHe reached into his robe and took out two stones. One was blue, the other red. The red one was a gem carved in the shape of a flame, while the blue one was a diamond-shaped gem. Both stones emanated a faint glow the same color as their bodies. Though the red and blue lights were weak, they seemed to repel each other.\n\n“Mother, thank you. If the Ice and Snow Goddess’s Stone hadn’t been constantly protecting my mind, perhaps my memories would truly be gone now. Mother, can you tell me what Nian Bing should do now? Should I really abandon all hatred, just as Grandpa Cha Ji said? No, I can’t do it! Those people made you suffer so much. I… I…”\n\nHis hands clenched the red and blue gems respectively. A searing fire element and a frigid ice element invaded his body from each palm, yet Nian Bing felt no discomfort from these two extreme energies. He was thinking, constantly thinking. On the Yang Guang Continent, the ranks of mages were the same in any of the five great empires. From lowest to highest, they were: Junior Mage, Intermediate Mage, Senior Mage, Great Mage, Magister, Archmagus, and God-Descender. He was currently just a lowly Junior Mage. The reason the Ice God Pagoda could stand as the guardian of the entire Ice Moon Empire was precisely because it possessed the most powerful of mages—a God-Descender. With his father’s power as a Magister, he was still struck down effortlessly before that God-Descender of Ice. No matter how much hatred he held, what use could it be?\n\nNian Bing’s heart grew cold. A God-Descender, to those who cultivated magic, was a peak that could be hoped for but never reached. It was not a realm one could achieve through pure training. It required not only opportunity and insight, but also the support of countless high-grade crystal stones. Only after years of arduous training and becoming one with heaven and earth was it possible to successfully descend a god and unleash the most powerful twelfth-tier magic. Besides the one in the Ice God Pagoda, legend told of two other God-Descenders on the entire continent, but no one could confirm their existence. Therefore, the Ice Moon Empire had always held a transcendent status on the Yang Guang Continent. To contend with a God-Descender with his meager abilities? That was undoubtedly seeking death. Grandpa Cha Ji was right. Unless my magic reaches a level sufficient to destroy my enemies, what is the point of hatred? Perhaps I really should seal away the memories of my hatred. Before Father went to the Ice God Pagoda, he said that only by not letting hatred cloud my reason would I have a chance to save Mother. I should do the same. Temporarily setting aside my hatred is perhaps the best way to ensure my revenge in the future.\n\nAt this thought, Nian Bing’s mind cleared, and a faint smile touched his lips. He murmured to himself, “Grandpa Cha Ji, although you did not succeed in sealing the hatred in my heart, I, Nian Bing, will seal it myself. When the day comes that I can contend with a God-Descender, only then will I take on the Rong surname that Father bestowed upon me. Father, Mother, would you truly be happy that Nian Bing has set aside his hatred? Rest assured, one day, one day I will claim justice for you.”\n\nHe clenched his fists tightly, the Ice and Snow Goddess’s Stone and the Flame God’s Stone pressing deep into his skin. Immersed in his decision, Nian Bing did not notice that the water and fire elements around his body were engaged in a strange exchange. Lying flat on the bed, he began his necessary daily meditation. His father had once told him that there were no shortcuts in cultivating magic. Only through constant meditation, through constant communication with the magical elements, could one gradually possess more powerful magical force. Under the effect of this magical force, one could resonate with magical elements of the same attribute and, through incantations, release even stronger magic.\n\nPreviously, Nian Bing had only cultivated fire-type magic. But before he was teleported by the scroll, his mother had exhausted her strength to give him one thing: the Ice and Snow Goddess’s Stone in his hand. After getting this stone, Nian Bing was shocked to discover that a portion of the fire-type magical force in his body had actually transformed into ice-type magical force. When he looked inward, the magical force in his body formed two distinct factions, separated on either side with his body as the center, which looked extremely strange. This was also why he had been able to unleash low-level magic with the two gems in a moment of crisis.\n\nToday was his first time cultivating since obtaining both gems. Closing his eyes, Nian Bing called out to the magical elements in the air. The half-blue, half-red scene appeared within him. As fire-type magical elements were absorbed into his body, they would naturally merge into the right half of his body, while the ice-type magical elements would naturally drift to his left half. The red and blue colors used the center of Nian Bing’s body as a dividing line, and except for his brain, they each fused on their own side, never encroaching upon the other.\n\nOnly now could Nian Bing calm his mind to think about his current magical situation, and the state of his body could not help but seem very strange to him. When Rong Tian had taught him magic in the past, he had told him that the best choice for a mage was to cultivate a single type of magic; only then would it be possible to reach the pinnacle of magic. If one divided their focus to cultivate several types of magic, it would inevitably cause their spiritual power to be scattered, and it would be very difficult to progress further after reaching a certain level. Moreover, among the seven known types of magic, there were two opposing pairs: ice and fire, and light and dark. Ice and water shared the same origin and could be considered one type of magic, as ice magic was itself a mutated form of water magic. But ice and fire were complete opposites; no one could possess both of these extreme magics at the same time. If one tried to cultivate both simultaneously, it was very likely they would be harmed by the clash between ice and fire. In the beginning, when Nian Bing first started learning magic, Rong Tian had let him choose, because his body could accept both fire and ice elements. In the end, Nian Bing chose fire magic, which was easier to start with, and had been cultivating it with Rong Tian ever since. However, his inherent ice constitution had not disappeared. Rong Tian had assumed that once Nian Bing’s fire magic reached a certain level, his ice constitution would become negligible, so he hadn’t paid it much attention. Even he had not realized that with every meditation Nian Bing undertook, his ice constitution was secretly influencing him.",

As a top-level magic stone, the most pure ice elemental breath is nurtured in the Snow Goddess Stone, and finally the ice quality of the Ice Bing is in silence, forcing the original fire magic power to the body of the other half. Originally, the fire magic power of Nian Bing Cultivation was not very pure. It has always been affected by the ice body. As soon as the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess appeared, the fire magic power in the Nian Bing body just separated out the ice elements that affected him continuously. Therefore, no matter whether it is ice or fire magic power, it is absolutely pure.\n\n\n\nNian Bing started practicing magic since she was five years old, and now it has been five years. The number of magicians on Yangon's mainland is extremely rare. The most fundamental reason is that the magician's cultivation is too difficult. If a warrior can achieve something in three years, at least reach a small level. As a magician, it is impossible to reach the level of an intermediate magician without ten years of meditation in the early stage. Even a middle-level magician may not be able to fight a warrior who has only practiced for three years in a one-to-one battle. The chanting time is the biggest disadvantage. Therefore, there are very few people who choose to practice magic, and even fewer people who successfully communicate with magic elements will enter the middle-level magician. But the existence of magicians is obviously necessary. Although they do not have the advantage in a one-on-one battle, they are essential if it is a military-level battle. Especially the large-scale murderous magic produced by advanced magicians can often change the entire battle. Therefore, no matter how difficult it is to cultivate a magician, he will always have the truth of his existence.\n\n\n\nNian Bing successfully reached the realm of a junior magician last year, which seemed to Rongtian very quickly, but he didn't know that Nian Bing himself was very outstanding in magic. If it weren't for the influence of ice, his progress would have been faster. At this time, under the influence of the Stone of the Ice and Snow God Stone and the Stone of the Fire God, the problems that have existed for many years finally disappeared. Since he is just a junior magician, both the fire element and the water element are not very strong, so he can still achieve a balance state in his body. Although the previous ills disappeared, new problems have already arrived, ice and fire have changed. What will happen if you continue to meditate like this? Will they always be at peace? Nian Bing didn't know the answer, and he didn't know what to do. It is difficult to cultivate magic, but it is even more difficult to give up a magic power in your body. Unless there is a magician who is in his third grade, it is impossible to succeed. And at this time, where did he go to find a magician? \n\n\n\nNian Bing, who was lying flat on the bed, kept thinking about these problems. Although the feeling of being cold on the left and the other was not comfortable, it did not cause him to experience excessive inappropriateness. What should I do? Continue to meditate like this? Although there are not many magical powers of ice and fire, they feel very solid, or perhaps, this is the function of the two gems.There is no other way now. In order to avenge, I must have stronger power. Since I cannot give up the magic cultivation, I can only continue and take one step at a time. Maybe, when your magic becomes stronger in the future, you will have a solution. Thinking of this, Nian Bing no longer felt hesitant, and finally began his first meditation after he split up his family. The two magic elements of ice and fire were quickly condensed into his body with the help of the two gemstones. Soon, he entered the state of meditation.\n\n\n\nIn the early morning, the crows filled the entire peach blossom forest with the sound of the birds. After not sleeping all night, I got up early.\n\n\n\n\"The little slut, it's up.\" Check the door open.\n\n\n\nNian Bingya woke up from the meditation state for a while and felt refreshed all over his body. The unprecedented comfort made him moan and stretched his waist subconsciously. Of course, there were some strange things in comfort, and the temperatures of the two sides of his body seemed to be clearer.\n\n\n\nSeeing Cha O, Nian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Master, you got up so early!\"\n\n\n\nI was afraid that my hypnosis would not work, so when I heard the word \"名名\" Bing called the word \"名名名\", he relaxed his voice, smiled slightly, and said, \"It's too early? It's getting up soon. Starting today, the master will officially teach you how to cook.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay.\" Nian Bing found that he had no doubts about himself. He stood up quickly. While the investigation was not careful, he carefully put away the two stones, sorted out the room simply, and then followed the investigation and walked out. \n\n\n\n\"Teacher, how did we start learning?\" Nian Bing asked curiously. Because he figured out the things about hatred, he now seems much more alive than yesterday, and the child's longing for novel things is undoubtedly revealed.\n\n\n\nCha suddenly smiled slightly and said, \"I had already thought about it yesterday and arranged a program for you to learn every day. At least, under the current circumstances, you just need to follow this program. Nian Bing, do you know what the first thing you have to experience to become a good chef?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing slammed her head in confusion, \"I haven't learned it before, so where do I know it.\"\n\n\n\nChaxian said seriously: \"To become a good chef, you must first go through a process and be familiar with the food process. Only by fully familiarizing yourself with the various flavors of food and knowing how to taste can you become a qualified chef. So, starting today, you must taste every dish I make to savor your taste and smell.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment, and he was so smart that he quickly responded, \"Master, what you mean is that you just want me to eat every day. Can you learn a good cookery?\"\n\n\n\nCha Qi smiled and said, \"Keat art is an art. Eating is also an art. Do you think it's so easy to eat? Not only do you have to eat, but you also have to eat the essence. Tell me what you have eaten and what you have eaten.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and clapped her hands and said, \"Okay! It's not simple yet. Then when will we start eating? Master, I'm already hungry.\"Due to hypnosis last night, he hadn't eaten anything except the first bowl of porridge, so why didn't he eat enough? \n\n\n\nThe check was very unpleasant and said, \"It's simple? In the future, you will know if this food is simple. Eating requires two processes. After completing these two processes, you can really start learning about cooking art.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing asked curiously: \"What are the two processes?\"\n\n\n\n  Cheered a slight smile and said, “These two processes are from thin to fat, and then from fat to thin.”\n\n\n\nAlthough Nian Bing is smart, she still doesn't understand the meaning of checking. Looking at his puzzled eyes, checking, \"You don't need to understand now. As you progress gradually, you will know the truth of these two stages. Well, at the beginning, I have prepared the morning meal for you. Go and eat it yourself in the kitchen.\"\n\n\n\nThe morning meal was very simple, with a large bowl of porridge and a few plates of side dishes. Nian Bing was already hungry, and with the extremely scrubbed handicraft, it almost swallowed it in a hurry, ending this morning meal as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\nCha Chi sat beside Nian Bing, watched him finish eating beautifully, and asked with a smile, \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said satisfied: \"It's delicious. Master, you are worthy of being a ghost chef, and the dishes you make are extremely simple.\"\n\n\n\nAfter a sudden remark, he said, \"It's a pity that my tendons have been broken, so I can only cook some of the simplest dishes. Well, no, stinky brat, you just want to hit me just now? Forgot what I just told you? What you need to tell me now is the feeling that this will give you early.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at Chauji with innocent eyes, \"I feel? I feel it's just delicious? I can't think it's too cheap!\"\n\n\n\nCha Jin knocked on Nian Bing's head, \"Idiot, of course I'm not a good one. I only know how delicious it is. What is the difference between you and ordinary people? You must tell what is good.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing said, \"Well, why didn't you say so earlier? You didn't explain it clearly yourself, so how can you blame me? I'm done eating, I'm going out to stretch my legs.\"\n\n  Zha Ji said helplessly, \"I'll let it slide this time, and I won't explain it to you either. If you answer me like that again at noon, you won't get any dinner. You should go get some exercise. Take that axe and go chop some firewood.\"\n\n  Nian Bing followed the direction Zha Ji was pointing and saw a great axe, nearly as tall as himself, propped in a corner. The blade was over a foot wide, and though it looked a bit rusty, he could still sense its sharpness. He nodded and said, \"Master, I'll go right away. How much firewood do we need to chop?\"\n\n  Zha Ji was stunned for a moment. He had expected Nian Bing to complain upon seeing the enormous axe, but to his surprise, the boy agreed without hesitation. He asked subconsciously, \"Don't you think this axe is too big?\"\n\n  Nian Bing said helplessly, \"Big or not, it still has to be chopped! Now that I'm here, just leave all this rough work to me. Your hands are injured, so you should rest more. Who knows, maybe your tendons will even heal.\" As he spoke, he walked toward the great axe.\n\n  Hearing Nian Bing's words, a warmth Zha Ji hadn't felt in many years spread through his chest. It felt as if something was caught in his throat, and his heart trembled slightly.\n\n  The axe was indeed heavy. Nian Bing had to drag it with both hands just to get it to move. Such a heavy axe was certainly not convenient for chopping wood.\n\n  Zha Ji said, \"Nian Bing, you only need to chop a little firewood, just enough for us to live on. What I need you to do is use this axe to *split* the wood—the finer the better. As a chef, you must have a strong body. At the same time, your knife skills need to be trained starting from raw strength. Do you understand?\"\n\n  Nian Bing nodded in understanding, smiled, and dragged the great axe outside.\n\n  \"Wait a moment.\" Zha Ji realized he had forgotten a most crucial matter and broke out in a cold sweat. Heaven had finally sent him such a fine disciple; if the boy lost his life due to his own carelessness, it would be a sin a hundred deaths could not atone for.\n\n  Nian Bing, who had just stepped out the door, turned to look at Zha Ji as he hurried out after him. \"Master, is there something else?\"\n\n  Zha Ji patted his chest and said, \"I must be getting old and muddled. You just arrived, and I forgot to tell you about this place. This forest is called the Peach Blossom Forest because over seventy percent of the trees that grow here are peach trees.\"\n\n  Nian Bing thought to himself, *Isn't that obvious? How could it be called the Peach Blossom Forest without peach trees?* \"So what?\"\n\n  Zha Ji said, \"Most of the peach blossoms here are a unique variant. Do you know why there are no people here? It's precisely because these blossoms secrete a toxin that spreads on the wind. I call it the Peach Blossom Miasma. Its poison is extremely potent; humans and animals who inhale it will immediately convulse and die. That's why this is one of the forbidden lands of the Ice Moon Empire. Aside from a few animals with natural immunity, no other living creatures exist here, let alone people. Therefore, you don't have to fear being pursued.\"\n\n  Nian Bing paused, stunned. \"If the Peach Blossom Miasma is so poisonous, why are you alright?\"\n\n  Zha Ji chuckled. \"Have you forgotten what your teacher does? I am a chef. When it comes to all things edible, no one's senses are keener than mine. Although the Peach Blossom Miasma is poisonous, it's not without a counter. Near any potent poison, something that counteracts it is bound to exist. In this forest, there's a type of Five-Leaf Grass. Made into a powder and ingested, it grants the body a resistance to the miasma, so naturally, you'll be fine. Here, eat this first. Keep taking it for three months, and your body will naturally develop an immunity, and you won't have to fear it anymore.\" As he spoke, Zha Ji handed a small porcelain vial to Nian Bing.\n\n  The powder made from the Five-Leaf Grass was bitter and astringent. Nian Bing nearly threw it up after swallowing it and only managed to get it all down with great difficulty. Only then did he drag the great axe toward the forest.\n\n  Entering the Peach Blossom Forest, Nian Bing observed his surroundings. The air was very fresh, with the faint fragrance of peach blossoms. It was also very humid, which was likely related to the Azure River next to the forest. There were only small gaps between the peach trees, and though he wasn't tall, he still had to be careful not to bump into them as he walked.\n\n  Peach trees aren't tall, not even the ancient ones. Their branches spread out to the sides, which made them much easier to split for firewood compared to trees with tall, straight trunks. However, Nian Bing now faced a problem: even if the branches were low, he still had to be able to lift the axe. At his young age, how could he possibly swing an axe that even a full-grown adult would find difficult to wield?\n\n  Staring at the peach tree before him, Nian Bing was at a loss. After several attempts, all he managed to do was tire himself out; at most, he could only get the axe to lift slightly off the ground. Strength had never been a mage's strong suit.\n\n  \"If I could just form an ice blade now, maybe I could chop down a branch,\" Nian Bing muttered to himself. But while he now possessed ice-elemental magic power, he had never practiced any ice magic incantations before. Without the proper spell, having the magic power was useless. Should he try using fire magic to burn it? He had long since memorized the fire magic incantations, from first to eighth tier, but that would be pointless unless he wanted to burn down the tree in front of him.\n\n  The axe was truly too heavy for a ten-year-old child. Sitting under the peach tree, Nian Bing put his mind, far sharper than that of his peers, to work. *Break off some branches to take back? No, if I do that, I won't be able to split them. I have to chop off some thick ones. But if I can't even lift the axe, how am I supposed to chop anything?*\n\n  Suddenly, a flash of inspiration struck Nian Bing. Although he didn't know any ice magic, there was a second-tier fire spell called the Fire Blade technique. It condensed fire elements to form a long, flaming blade to attack enemies. The Fire Blade's primary attack power was concentrated in its heat; using it to chop a tree would not only be ineffective but could also easily start a fire. It would be a disaster if the Peach Blossom Forest caught fire. *But,* he thought, *what if I modified the Fire Blade incantation, changing 'fire' to 'ice' while chanting? I wonder if that would work.* With his current magic power, casting a second-tier spell would be a stretch, but it was worth a try. After all, he had nothing to lose.\n\n  Nian Bing leaped up from the ground, tossing the axe aside without a second thought. He took his treasure, the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess, from his robes. Smiling faintly, he pinched it between his thumb and forefinger, raised it high above his head, and chanted with intense concentration: \"Oh, elements of ice! I beseech you, condense into a sharp, great blade, and sever the bonds and shackles of this world.\" The sound and intonation were exactly the same as for the Fire Blade technique. He could clearly feel the surrounding ice elements rapidly gathering toward him, resonating with the ice-elemental magic power in the left half of his body. In mid-air, a nearly transparent, foot-long ice blade materialized. Nian Bing was overjoyed; he knew he had succeeded. Pointing his hand at a thigh-thick branch in front of him, he commanded, \"Go.\"\n\n  With a flash of light and a *thump*, the ice blade struck the branch and shattered into pieces. After all, his magic power wasn't yet strong enough, and the blade's power was very limited. Even so, Nian Bing was thrilled. He knew he had found a shortcut. Perhaps mid- and high-level spells each had their own unique incantations, but for low-level magic, the chanting method should be more or less the same. The branch, struck by the ice blade, now had a crack about a third of the way through it. Nian Bing didn't try to use another ice blade. He ran to the branch, grabbed it with both hands, and pulled with all his body weight.\n\n  A weakened branch, after all, is not made of metal. With a *crack*, it instantly snapped.\n\n  He used the same method again and again. To his surprise, Nian Bing discovered that the ice-elemental magic power he had just recently acquired was actually a bit greater than his previous fire-elemental magic power. He managed to cast the ice blade seven consecutive times before his ice magic was completely depleted. On the ground, there were now seven thick branches.",

    "content": "The use of magic made his spirit a bit lethargic. Leaning against a nearby tree, he began a short meditation.\n\nThe Ice Goddess's Stone lived up to its reputation as a top-tier ice-element gem. In just one hour, it helped Nianbing recover a small amount of ice-element magic power. The process from depletion to recovery, coupled with last night's meditation, made his magic power improve slightly.\n\nChaji had just finished making lunch, standing in front of the wooden house and stretching his somewhat stiff body. He felt a bit strange. Why had Nianbing been gone so long and still hadn't returned? Could he really use that axe to chop firewood? Impossible. He had told him to take the axe just to see how long it would take the child to return. The longer it took, the longer it proved he was thinking about methods to chop the tree; a person who is good at thinking will have a better understanding of dishes when cooking. This could also be considered a simple test Chaji gave Nianbing. But he had been gone for over two hours, and the sun was already hanging high in the sky, which made Chaji somewhat anxious.\n\nJust as Chaji was about to go out and look for Nianbing, a clear voice rang out, \"Master, I'm back. Look, is this enough firewood?\"\n\nNianbing walked out of the peach blossom forest, his head covered in sweat. Seven or eight peach tree branches were dragged back by him, tied to the large axe with vines from the forest. The weight clearly put a considerable strain on him; he seemed a bit breathless when speaking.\n\n\"You really chopped firewood? Can you even lift that axe?\" Chaji asked in surprise.\n\nNianbing's small face flushed red, and he said, \"No, I used magic to chop these down. But my magic is relatively weak. After chopping and then recovering, I saw the sun high in the sky, and it was almost noon, so I came back first. I'll go again this afternoon.\"\n\nChaji's heart stirred. \"What magic did you use? Fire-element magic can chop firewood? You weren't trying to burn this place down, were you?\"\n\n\"Of course not? I chopped them with an ice blade. Look, Ice Element! I implore you, condense into a sharp greatblade, sever the bonds and shackles of the world!\" Amidst flashing light, a nearly transparent ice blade appeared before him.\n\n\"Ah! You can use two elements of magic?\" Light almost shone from Chaji's eyes. He wasn't a mage, so he naturally didn't know that ice-element magic and fire-element magic cannot be cultivated simultaneously; he only thought that he had picked up a treasure. \"Ice, that's great! Ice can also be applied to cuisine. It seems I'll have to change my teaching methods for you. If ice and fire are used properly, the dishes created will be... Alright, let's go. Let's eat first.\"\n\nLunch wasn't particularly lavish, with only two dishes and ordinary rice. However, how could dishes made by Chaji be anything but excellent? Nianbing ate this meal with even greater relish. Since he had been wandering across the continent with his father, it was the first time he had eaten so consistently. The satisfaction of his stomach made his small face look rosy.\n\n\"How was it? How does it feel?\" Seeing Nianbing finish eating, Chaji eagerly asked.\n\n\"Delicious, really delicious,\" Nianbing said from the bottom of his heart.\n\nChaji stared at him, dumbfounded. \"That same line again?\"\n\n\"Oh, I forgot. Maybe I overused my spiritual energy chopping firewood with magic just now. Master, I'll definitely remember tonight.\"\n\nChaji looked at Nianbing speechless, almost blowing a fuse. He snorted, and said, \"I'll forgive you this time. Three strikes and you're out.\"\n\nNianbing chuckled, and said, \"Master, don't be angry. Actually, I have a feeling this time. Although I don't know what these two dishes of yours are, their taste is fresh and savory, and there's a light, fragrant aftertaste. They're crispy to eat and feel very comfortable. And they feel warm in my stomach.\"\n\nChaji said exasperatedly, \"Is that all? I wasted so much effort for nothing. Do you know why they taste so good? When ordinary people cook green vegetables, they just put in oil first, then, after the oil is hot, they sauté ginger and scallions, then add the vegetables and stir-fry them, and finally add seasoning before serving. The reason my stir-fried dishes are delicious is, first, the ingredients. I use the freshest vegetables, put into the wok immediately after being picked from the forest. Secondly, I didn't use oil, so you won't feel greasy. If ordinary people don't use oil, they probably can't even stir-fry dishes, but I can use water instead, because I've added special things to this water of mine; some medicinal substances exist within it. After mixing, this water not only prevents the vegetables from sticking to the wok, but also makes the green vegetables even more fragrant and sweet. At the same time, heat control is very important when stir-frying. Often, just a split second makes the resulting taste completely different. You must remember, no matter what food it is, to make it delicious, you must bring out its original flavor. Do you understand?\"\n\nNianbing said somewhat blankly, \"Teacher, isn't it too early for you to tell me all this? Shouldn't we take it step by step?\"\n\nChaji said, \"I'm just letting you know first that delicious dishes naturally have a reason for being delicious. Alright, go take a nap for a bit. Start splitting firewood this afternoon. There's a cleaver under the corner of the wall to the left of the kitchen; that's what you should use. From now on, you're not allowed to use magic for chopping or splitting firewood, understand? That's a complete waste. Magic should be used at the most crucial moment of cooking to reflect its value. If only I knew magic, how great that would be!\"\n\nFrom this day forward, Nianbing lived an orderly life. Every morning he would wake up early, first tidying up his bedroom and the kitchen simply, then eat breakfast and listen to Chaji lecture on culinary knowledge. Chaji seemed not in a hurry to teach him practical operations, only carefully explaining various knowledge a chef needs to master. The second thing was to chop firewood. Chopping firewood wasn't difficult; the difficulty lay in splitting it. Under Chaji's guidance, Nianbing learned that splitting firewood required observing the wood grain. Different grains meant different splitting directions, and it was not an easy task to split the firewood evenly. Lunch was the same as breakfast; besides expressing his feelings about the dishes Chaji made, he would listen to Chaji's lectures. In the afternoon, it was also splitting firewood. Chaji didn't demand a certain quantity, but rather that the firewood he split be fine, the finer the better. After dinner, having listened to Chaji's lectures, Nianbing would return to his room to meditate. Meditation was not only the best way to cultivate magic power but also the best way to rest.\n\nDays passed one by one. Nianbing finally understood what it meant to go from thin to fat. Although he constantly split firewood every day, his exercise volume wasn't significant. Coupled with Chaji constantly changing the dishes he made for him, adding nourishing ingredients like Solomon's Seal and ginseng gathered from the forest to every meal, Nianbing's body expanded like a balloon, rapidly developing horizontally from his originally thin and small frame. Of course, his height also grew significantly under the nourishment of the food, but compared to his weight, it was somewhat disproportionate.\n\nA year later, the originally handsome child disappeared. No matter from where one looked, Nianbing's body resembled a ball. When Nianbing asked Chaji if he was too fat, Chaji just told him that he would definitely slim down later.\n\n\"Master, do I still have to split firewood today? What I'm splitting now is already very fine!\" Nianbing ran into Chaji's room and said somewhat discontentedly.\n\n\"Split it, keep splitting it. You're still far from done,\" Chaji said without looking at him, turning over in bed. Since Nianbing came, he had become much more relaxed. He didn't have to do any of the chores himself; he just needed to make three meals for Nianbing every day.\n\n\"But Master, when will I ever be done splitting this?\" Splitting firewood every day, for a whole year, probably no one could endure it.\n\n\"Done? Being done is simple! What you're splitting now is indeed fine enough, but it's not even enough. When you can split all the wood fibers to be the same thickness, then you'll be done,\" Chaji said, not in a hurry at all. He smacked his lips twice and continued his morning nap.\n\nEvenness—these two words reminded Nianbing of the magic power within his body. With the help of the Ice Goddess's Stone and the Fire God's Stone, over the past year, his magical progress had been extremely rapid. Only now did he understand why his father, at only thirty-seven years old, could become a Magus; it was probably due to the Fire God's Stone. However, a problem also presented itself to him. At first, it was just a superficial sensation, feeling one side of his body cool and the other side hot. But now, the temperature on both sides of his body was distinctly different. The left side of his body, when immersed in water, could even create ice water, while the right side was so hot it felt like he had a high fever. One cold, one hot, often gave Nianbing a dizzying sensation. Especially when he used magic, leading to uneven magic power on both sides, this sensation became even more pronounced. Therefore, later when using magic, he had to use one ice-element spell and then an equivalent water-element spell, making the magic power consumption exactly the same, in order to avoid being affected.\n\nNianbing did not tell Chaji about this situation. In order to exact revenge, he clearly knew that continuing like this might put him in danger, but he still cultivated without hesitation. He believed that as long as his magic power could be maintained in an even state, there would be no problems. But was that really the case? Perhaps even an Oracle could not give him an answer. After all, nowadays, no one dared to defy convention and cultivate two completely opposite types of magic.\n\nPowerlessly, he walked into the yard, pulled over a small wooden stool and sat down. With his left hand, he pulled over the cleaver, and with his right hand, he placed the firewood in front of him. When the cleaver was transferred to his right hand, Nianbing's gaze changed, becoming extraordinarily focused. His mind was completely concentrated on the firewood in front of him; the wood grain was clearly scanned into his mind. He didn't move, just quietly observed the firewood. Chaji had taught him that only by striking at the most suitable moment could he achieve the best effect. The most suitable moment was the instant he completely comprehended the firewood before him.\n\nHis hand turned, the blade moved. Eight consecutive cuts, like flowing clouds and running water, without the slightest hesitation. The firewood remained standing there, without the slightest movement. The sharp cleaver reflected a metallic sheen under the sunlight.",

    "content": "Pfft. Nian Bing blew a breath at the log, and the bark on its outer layer fell away to both sides. The entire log had become a perfect octagon. Those eight chops had merely been to strip the bark and give the log a regular shape. Only in this way could the wood slivers he split be truly uniform.\n\nHis left hand didn't need to steady the log; Nian Bing was that confident in his single-stroke cuts. While getting chubby might have affected his agility, it greatly aided his stability and strength. The chubby flesh on his face twitched, and the axe in Nian Bing’s hand moved once more. In his grasp, it was like a gentle breeze, sweeping directly toward one of the log’s eight corners. Under the axe’s touch, a sliver of wood separated from the log and lay quietly beside the discarded bark.\n\nThis time, Nian Bing was chopping with extreme concentration. Every strike was meticulously calculated before he swung. One by one, the wood slivers appeared, and they were indeed remarkably uniform—so much so that it was difficult to discern any difference with the naked eye.\n\nHow long did it take to chop a log? Ordinarily, Nian Bing would finish with just a hundred or so quick swings. But for this particular log, he spent the better part of half a day.\n\nZha Ji had appeared behind Nian Bing at some point, but he hadn't made a sound. Nian Bing, his mental energy completely focused, hadn’t noticed his arrival. His entire spirit was concentrated on the log before him; every cut was made with deep deliberation.\n\nZha Ji smiled, a smile of satisfaction. Chopping wood was not only a good way to train strength, but also to hone one's knife work. An ordinary chef might find a heavy wood axe too clumsy, but it was precisely this kind of difficult-to-control, rustic axe that placed the highest demands on the user. To master knife skills with an axe, one’s mind, eyes, and hands had to be in perfect harmony. Compared to simply training the hands, the art of splitting slivers with an axe was far more exquisite.\n\nWith a final swing, the axe flashed with a cold light. The sound of applause came from behind him. Nian Bing wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve and turned to look at his master. “Teacher, would you say my splits are uniform this time?”\n\nZha Ji nodded. “Not bad. When I first practiced this skill of splitting slivers with an axe, it took me a full three years just to achieve initial success. The fact that you can split uniform slivers proves you have already reached a basic level of mastery.”\n\nNian Bing’s face lit up. “Does that mean I don’t have to chop anymore?”\n\nZha Ji’s expression changed, and he said sternly, “You’re still far from done. Though your slivers are mostly uniform, they aren’t *perfectly* uniform, and they could be even finer. Besides, look at how much time you took. Only when you can finish splitting a thirty-centimeter diameter log within three minutes will you be considered to have truly passed.”\n\nNian Bing said dejectedly, “How long is that going to take! Master, you tell me about the principles and methods of cooking every day, but you never let me actually practice. When will I ever graduate?”\n\nZha Ji smiled faintly. “Child, you must understand that building a foundation is the most important thing. If you rush for results without a solid foundation, you will never reach the highest realm of the culinary arts. Chopping wood is certainly tedious, but the training it provides for your hands, eyes, and mind is something no other method can achieve. Once you have perfected this art of splitting slivers with an axe, you’ll find that you can achieve twice the results with half the effort in all your other studies.” As he spoke, his eyes, full of deep meaning, fell upon the silk-like wood slivers. “The way you observe a log can also be applied to observing ingredients. Every ingredient, just like a log of wood, has its own characteristics and grain.”\n\nNian Bing’s heart stirred, and he seemed to understand something. In truth, he didn't really mind chopping wood. Ever since he had started three months ago, he had been surprised to find that the growth of his mental energy was astonishing. His control over magic was countless times stronger than before; even ordinary beginner-level magic could become magnificent in his hands. Mental energy, magical power, and magical control were all mutually reinforcing. The stronger his mental energy, the better and faster he could absorb magical elements and the more skillfully he could control the use of magic. Who would have thought that simple wood chopping could bring such great benefits?\n\nSeeing Nian Bing staring somewhat blankly, Zha Ji thought to himself, *Am I being too harsh on this disciple?* He knew the boy’s aptitude for understanding was so much greater than his own had been. In truth, it had taken him five years to achieve initial success in splitting slivers, and he hadn't reached full mastery until he graduated after ten years. Of course, that was partly because he was learning other culinary arts at the same time, but purely in terms of aptitude, he was far inferior to this boy. In fact, he had already been teaching him the true culinary arts all along. His daily lectures imparted theoretical knowledge, the daily meals trained his sense of smell and taste discrimination, and splitting slivers with the axe was the best physical training. Once all these components were complete, when it was time to integrate them, his progress would become incredibly fast.\n\n“Alright, go get the cart from behind the cabin. We’re heading out.”\n\nNian Bing was taken aback. “Heading out? Where are we going?” Ever since arriving at the Peach Blossom Forest, he had never once left, nor had he ever seen Zha Ji leave.\n\nZha Ji said, “It’s been a long time. Although we can gather vegetables from the forest, we still need to buy necessary seasonings, and we’re running low on rice, too. You’ve been here a year. It’ll do you good to get out for a walk.”\n\n“That’s great! We can finally go out!” Although Nian Bing's mind was no longer that of a child, he was, after all, only eleven years old. He had long grown a bit tired of the structured life here. How could he not be excited to get out for a bit? Tossing the axe aside, he scampered off toward the back of the cabin, taking two steps for every one.\n\nTo avoid being disturbed, the cabin Zha Ji had built was located in the very center of the Peach Blossom Forest. Due to the Peach Blossom Miasma, though the forest was quite large, it was free of poisonous snakes and fierce beasts, so he hadn't even bothered to build a fence. For a man with severed hand tendons, building such a house was already no small feat.\n\nThe so-called \"cart\" was a simple pushcart made entirely of wood. Fortunately, the two wheels were reasonably round, so pushing it wasn't too strenuous. Over the past year, though Nian Bing had transformed from a handsome little boy into a cute little fatty, his physical strength had also grown considerably. The tonics hadn't been for nothing, and combined with the exercise from cutting and splitting wood, he had become quite strong. Pushing the wooden cart was not difficult at all.\n\n“Master, if you get tired, you can sit in the cart and I’ll push you,” Nian Bing said, excited and eager to show off his strength to Zha Ji.\n\nZha Ji chuckled. “I’m not that old yet. You’d better save your energy. On the way back, I expect you’ll have a lot to push. Just don’t come crying to me then. We only go out once a year, so think about how much we need to buy.”\n\nNian Bing’s eyes darted. “Master! My magic practice hasn’t been going too well recently, especially my fire magic. It seems a bit unstable. When I get too tired, sometimes my control over the fire magic in my body slips. If you aren’t afraid of me burning all our things, then buying a lot is fine.”\n\nZha Ji said, exasperated, “You brat, are you threatening me?”\n\n“Of course not, how would I dare threaten you,” Nian Bing said, but the laughter in his eyes couldn't hide his true intentions. Zha Ji was at a loss with his magic-wielding apprentice. He snorted and said, “We’ll see when the time comes.”\n\nThough no one ever came through the Peach Blossom Forest, Zha Ji had cleared a small path leading out back when he used to chop wood himself. Later, when Nian Bing took over the task, clearing the path had become his job. By intentionally felling trees in a certain way, they made it easy to leave the forest.\n\nBy the time they walked out of the Peach Blossom Forest, the sun was approaching its zenith. Although the Ice Moon Empire was in the northern part of the Yang Guang Continent and the temperature was relatively low, the direct sunlight still brought a slight summer heat. It didn't bother Nian Bing, who carried the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess, but Zha Ji’s constitution had never been good, and he was already a little out of breath.\n\n“Kid, aren’t you tired? Let’s rest a bit,” Zha Ji said, stopping Nian Bing.\n\n“Oh.” Nian Bing pushed the cart under a large tree and helped Zha Ji sit in the shade. “Master, do you want me to cast a little spell to drive off the heat?”",

    "content": "\"Forget it.\" Cha Ji waved his hand dismissively. \"Your magic is too extreme; I can't take it.\" He still clearly remembered the last time Nian Bing had tried to cool the air in their room and nearly turned him into a popsicle. In truth, even Nian Bing himself didn't know that he had already reached the level of an Intermediate Mage. He could now use all fire and ice magic from the first to the third tier. Training with two top-grade gemstones, the results were indeed far superior to those of an ordinary person.\n\n\"Master, I'm a little hungry,\" Nian Bing said, patting his round belly.\n\nCha Ji glanced at him and said, \"Just bear it a little longer. There'll be food once we reach Ice Snow City.\"\n\n\"Ice Snow City?\" A look of curiosity flickered in Nian Bing's eyes.\n\n\"Yes, Ice Snow City. In the Ice Moon Empire, all cities are named after ice. For example, the capital of the Ice Moon Empire is called Ice Moon City. This Ice Snow City is the second-largest city in the empire. See that main road ahead? Follow it southwest for a few dozen *li*¹, and we'll be there.\"\n\nJust as Cha Ji finished speaking, the crisp sound of horse hooves rang out. The sound wasn't loud, but it grew from distant to near, becoming clearer and clearer. Looking in the direction of the sound, they saw a mounted party heading southwest along the main road. At the head of the procession were four knights, each on a spirited, tall horse. They wore matching silver light armor, looking quite imposing. A broadsword, about three feet long, hung at each of their waists. Though they were moving forward, their eyes constantly scanned both sides of the road, as if on high alert. Behind the four knights was a carriage. It looked spacious and magnificent, pulled by four tall, pure white horses. Judging by its size, it could probably seat seven or eight people without feeling crowded. The curtains were embroidered with patterns in silver thread; though not a distinct image, they faintly exuded an air of authority. The coachman appeared to be around the same age as Cha Ji, holding the reins and leisurely steering the four fine horses, keeping the carriage moving at a smooth and steady pace. On either side of the carriage, two knights in silver armor stood guard, and behind them followed a small squad of ten more knights. A total of eighteen knights, their uniform attire extremely eye-catching. Though still some distance from where Cha Ji and Nian Bing were, they were already clearly discernible.\n\n\"Master, who are those people? They look so impressive,\" Nian Bing asked.\n\nA glint flashed in Cha Ji's eyes. \"They look like the family of some high official. But they don't seem to be from the Ice Moon Empire.\"\n\nNian Bing asked doubtfully, \"How can you be so sure?\"\n\nCha Ji snorted. \"Ginger is spiciest when it's old, naturally. Look at the embroidery on that carriage. It's a type of artistic script in the Orlan language. From that alone, you can tell this party is from the Orlan Empire. And these knights are clearly not your average mercenaries; they are true soldiers, tested by blood and fire on the battlefield. Otherwise, how could they have such a heavy, murderous aura? Who but a high official or a noble could command so many real soldiers? Therefore, I judge that they must be the family of some dignitary from the Orlan Empire, and perhaps the dignitary himself is inside.\"\n\nHearing this, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a glimmer of admiration. To deduce so much from mere appearance—this master of his truly earned the title of \"spicy old ginger.\"\n\nJust then, the sound of urgent hoofbeats suddenly came from the other direction, causing Nian Bing to look back. He saw a single rider approaching the procession as fast as lightning. The entire party stopped almost simultaneously, but they showed no alarm. In fact, the four knights at the front dismounted.\n\nWith a loud neigh, the swift rider's horse reared up just as it was about to collide with the knights, its two front hooves high in the air before landing to the side, its forward momentum coming to a screeching halt. The rider's equestrian skill could only be described as divine. On the horse was another knight, also wearing the same silver armor as the other eighteen. The difference was a long, white feather adorning his helmet.\n\nCha Ji let out a soft \"Ah.\" \"I know who they are now. They seem to be members of the Orlan Empire's ace cavalry unit, the Silver Feather Knight Regiment. To be escorted by them personally, it seems the person in that carriage is no ordinary figure.\"\n\n\"The Silver Feather Knight Regiment? What's that?\" Nian Bing was like an eager student, constantly asking about things he didn't understand. Cha Ji showed no impatience; he clearly wanted Nian Bing to learn more about the various nations on the continent. He said in a low voice, \"The Silver Feather Knight Regiment is famous throughout the entire Yang Guang Continent. It's the ace of aces of the Orlan Empire. There's a saying: 'Their colorful feathers and silver armor shake the world.' They wear feathers of different colors on their helmets to denote their rank. In terms of martial skill, the warrior ranks, from lowest to highest, are Warrior, High Warrior, Sword Master, Grand Sword Master, Martial Artist, Martial Saint, and Divine Master. In terms of level, Warriors are almost equivalent to you Mages. But as you know, in a one-on-one, close-quarters fight, it's hard for a Mage to beat a Warrior. Of course, that's not absolute. From what I know, if a Mage reaches the level of Magister, a Warrior of the same rank would have a hard time harming them. Among warriors, a Divine Master is on the same level as a God-Descended Mage. How powerful they are, probably very few people know, because Divine Masters are just a legend nowadays. At least for God-Descended Mages, there's still that one in the Ice God Tower who is alive and well, but I've never heard of any martial artist at the Divine Master level. Perhaps they only existed during the wars decades ago. They're all long dead now. As for these soldiers of the Silver Feather Knight Regiment, every single one of them has the strength of at least a Sword Master. That one with the white feather on his helmet should be a squad leader, probably close to the strength of a Grand Sword Master. Although they are light cavalry, their offensive power is no less than that of heavy cavalry, and they have a far greater advantage in speed and agility. Add to that their coordinated battle formations, and there are pitifully few knight regiments on the continent that can stand against them.\"\n\nNian Bing stuck out his tongue. \"They're that amazing! Wouldn't ten thousand Sword Master-level warriors be comparable to ten thousand High Mages?\"\n\nCha Ji glared at him. \"You're so ignorant. Don't go telling people you're my disciple.\"\n\nNian Bing snorted. \"Is being your disciple such an honor? I don't think so. Of course I know what ten thousand mages represent in a real war. If they cast their spells together in concert, probably no knight regiment, no matter how formidable, could charge through. Mages aren't stupid enough to fight knights head-on. I was just talking about a comparison of strength.\"\n\nCha Ji huffed irritably. \"You brat, are you playing dumb with me? It seems you know quite a bit after all.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled slyly. \"Of course! The wars between the great empires are always the same old formula: warriors clash at the front while mages bombard from the back. It's just a battle of attrition. What's so interesting about that?\"\n\nCha Ji shook his head and said with a serious expression, \"No, you're wrong. War is also an art, an art of iron and blood. If it were as simple as you say, those so-called famous generals would be out of a job. But none of that has anything to do with us. In the future, you just need to learn your culinary arts well enough.\"\n\nThe Silver Feather Knight who had galloped over swung out of his stirrups and dismounted. He walked a few steps to the front of the carriage and said respectfully, \"Madam, Miss, we are only a few dozen *li* from Ice Snow City. I have already booked an inn there. Shall we rest for a while, or push on to Ice Snow City for lunch?\"\n\nA lazy yet heavenly voice drifted from the carriage. \"Captain Feng, the scenery here is nice. Let's rest for a bit. We've been traveling for so long, everyone must be tired.\"\n\nCaptain Feng said respectfully, \"Yes, Madam.\" With that, he gestured with his eyes to the knights beside him. The knights immediately dismounted one by one and walked toward the side of the road. Their direction was right toward Cha Ji and Nian Bing. As it happened, the place where Cha Ji and his disciple were resting was a small clearing, where several large trees blocked the sunlight, their dappled, dancing shadows bringing a sense of cool relief.\n\nThe knights had obviously seen Cha Ji and Nian Bing long before. One of them strode over and said in a cold, hard voice, \"You need to leave at once.\" As he spoke, he casually tossed a few silver coins toward Cha Ji.\n\nOn the Yang Guang Continent, the currencies of all nations were interchangeable. The most valuable was the Purple Gold Coin. One Purple Gold Coin was equal to ten Gold Coins, which was equal to one hundred Silver Coins, or one thousand Copper Coins. A few silver coins were enough for an ordinary family to live on for half a month. These knights could be considered quite generous.\n\n---\n¹A Chinese unit of distance, roughly 500 meters or 1/3 of a mile.",

    "content": "As a former Ghost Chef, Zha Ji was accustomed to receiving the most lavish treatment wherever he went. Seeing a few silver coins tossed their way, he didn't even deign to look at them. He snorted coldly and said, \"Do you take us for beggars? You don't own the sides of the official road.\"\n\nThe knight stepped forward. His expression didn't change, but an invisible aura emanated from him, exuding a subtle pressure as he repeated his earlier words. \"Please leave at once.\"\n\n\"What right do you have to be so tyrannical?\" Nian Bing shouted, angrily stepping in front of his master. Though he knew the man possessed the strength of a Sword Master, he showed no fear.\n\nLooking at the chubby little boy before him, the knight couldn't help but frown. His hand went to the hilt of his sword as he repeated for the third time, \"Please leave at once.\" It was obvious that if they refused again, he would not hesitate to act.\n\nJust then, two people stepped down from the carriage—two women. The heavenly voice from before spoke again. \"Let it be. This place doesn't belong to us. There's no need to make things difficult for others while we're traveling.\" The melodious voice drew Nian Bing's attention, and when he saw the two beautiful figures, he froze.\n\nThe woman in front appeared to be twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. She wore a pale blue dress embroidered with beautiful patterns in silver thread. She had delicate brows, a fine nose, and skin as smooth as cream. Her long, dark-green hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall, held back by a single silver clasp. Her blue eyes were as clear as water, and a faint smile graced her lips as she, too, looked at him.\n\nNian Bing's gaze was completely transfixed. His normally steady hands were now trembling slightly. Even Zha Ji, upon seeing the woman, couldn't help but marvel inwardly. In all his years of traveling the continent, he had seen very few women of such exquisite beauty.\n\n\"You little lecher, who said you could look at my mother like that?\" The little girl beside the beautiful woman suddenly jumped out, planting her hands on her hips as she glared at Nian Bing. She looked to be about twelve or thirteen years old and was wearing a white dress. Her features bore a strong resemblance to the beautiful woman's, full of youthful innocence. Even in her anger, she was no less adorable. Her short, dark-green hair barely brushed her ears, and with her hands on her hips, she looked all the more endearingly petulant.\n\n\"Mama... Mama...\" Nian Bing's eyes glistened with unshed tears. He suddenly let out a loud cry, \"Ma—ma—!\" Zha Ji failed to grab him in time, and he shot forward toward the beautiful woman.\n\nThe knight who had been standing before them moved with extreme speed, taking a sideways step to block Nian Bing's path. But at that moment, Nian Bing's eyes saw nothing but the beautiful woman. His stout-looking body dodged to the side with incredible quickness. His right hand instinctively drew the longsword from the knight's waist, and, using the sword like a saber, he unleashed seven rapid slashes at the man. At the same time, he flicked the fingers of his left hand, and two ice awls shot out, aiming straight for the knight's eyes.\n\nAs a Sword Master and a knight of the Silver Feather Knight Order, he had surely been tested by blood and fire. But even so, how could he be on guard against a child who only came up to his waist? The longsword he had carried for years seemed to come alive in Nian Bing's hands. Though the seven dense, consecutive slashes followed no particular technique, their sheer speed solved everything. Acting on instinct to protect himself, the knight leaned back, dodging the ice awls and the longsword. He avoided the ice awls, but his reaction was a beat too slow to completely evade the seven slashes. After a year of training splitting silk threads with a wood chopper, Nian Bing's wrist strength was already close to that of an adult. The longsword struck a shower of sparks from the knight's silver armor. While it didn't truly harm him, it forced him into an extremely awkward position.\n\nFor Nian Bing, it was more than enough time. Skirting around the knight, he rushed toward the beautiful woman, tears streaming down his chubby little face, his entire being radiating an aura of sorrow.\n\nTo a knight, his sword is his life. To have it stolen was an absolute, utter disgrace, especially by a mere child. The once-calm knight let out an enraged roar. With a single bound, he was right behind Nian Bing. A faint blue light gathered in his right hand as he brought it down directly toward the top of Nian Bing's head.\n\n\"Look out!\" Zha Ji cried out in alarm.\n\nBut in that moment, Nian Bing's eyes and heart held only the beautiful woman. All other sounds were naturally filtered out. Still clutching the knight's sword, he continued running forward, completely unaware that the enraged palm strike descending behind him, powerful enough to kill him several times over, was beckoning to him like the god of death.\n\n\"He's just a child.\" A soft sigh was heard. A figure flashed, and a slender, beautiful hand, glowing with a silver light, blocked death's summons. The knight staggered, his face flushed red, and he stumbled several steps to the side before regaining his footing.\n\nThe one who had suddenly saved Nian Bing was none other than the beautiful woman. Her figure had abruptly vanished from Nian Bing's line of sight, causing him to pause for a moment. Seeing that she was now right beside him, he immediately dropped the sword and cried out in anguish, \"Mama!\" Like a baby swallow returning to its nest, he threw himself into the beautiful woman's arms. Of course, if a baby swallow were as chubby as he was, it probably wouldn't be able to fly.\n\nThe beautiful woman was somewhat taken aback as she held Nian Bing's shoulders, unsure of what to do. Before her marriage, she was famous for her fiery temper. Although she had mellowed since, anyone who knew of her reputation gave her a wide berth. Other than her husband, if any other man dared to even touch her, he would likely be hacked to pieces. Yet now, as the grief-stricken Nian Bing rushed into her embrace, a maternal feeling rose up in her uncontrollably. Not only did she not push him away, she instinctively gathered him into her arms.\n\n\"Don't cry, child. Tell Auntie, what's wrong?\" the beautiful woman asked gently.\n\n\"Mama, Mama, don't leave me, don't leave me!\" The longing for his mother that Nian Bing held in his heart erupted in that instant, and he clutched her dress tightly, sobbing his heart out.\n\nSeeing her mother being monopolized by someone else, the little girl who had gotten out of the carriage with her would have none of it. She ran over in a few steps and pushed at Nian Bing with both hands. \"What are you doing? You're not allowed to hug my mama!\"\n\nThe little girl's strength was astonishing. Even if Nian Bing had been prepared, he would have been no match for her. He staggered and tumbled to the side. But he was still gripping the beautiful woman's dress. With the sound of tearing silk, the woman cried out in surprise as Nian Bing tore a strip from each side of her skirt, revealing glimpses of tender skin. Her beautiful face flushed crimson, and she hurriedly clutched the hem of her dress to cover herself and prevent further exposure. The knights who had come with her all quickly turned around, praying silently, *I didn't see anything, I didn't see anything. If the Marquis finds out, he'll probably have our eyes gouged out at the very least.*\n\n\"Chen Chen, what are you doing?\" the beautiful woman scolded her daughter after arranging her tattered dress.\n\n\"Mama,\" Chen Chen said, aggrieved, \"why is he calling you Mama? You're my mama, and only mine!\"\n\nThe beautiful woman gave her daughter a doting look and shook her head helplessly. A silver light appeared, and under its strange glow, the torn dress actually mended itself. Though it looked a bit awkward, it was at least whole again.\n\nThe fall seemed to have cleared Nian Bing's head a little. Zha Ji had run over by now and was helping him up from the ground. \"Nian Bing, what's gotten into you?\" he asked, his eyes filled with worry. Right now, Zha Ji's greatest fear was that the memory seal he had placed on Nian Bing had been broken.\n\nNian Bing stood up, letting Zha Ji brush the dust from his clothes. His gaze was still fixed dazedly on the beautiful woman as he murmured, \"You... you're not my mother. My mother's hair is blue.\"\n\nThe beautiful woman had finished fixing her dress by now. She walked gently over to Nian Bing and said, \"Little one, does Auntie look very much like your mother?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded forcefully.\n\nLooking at his chubby little face, the beautiful woman's eyes filled with a trace of pity. \"Then where is your mother?\"\n\nNian Bing, now lucid, lowered his head and shook it softly. \"I don't know. I only have my master.\"\n\nHearing this, Zha Ji let out a sigh of relief. He quickly said, \"My lady, I'm so sorry. My apprentice's parents are both gone. He was probably just missing his own mother too much. Please forgive us for the disturbance.\"\n\nThe beautiful woman smiled slightly. \"It's all right. He's a very cute child.\"\n\nChen Chen came closer from the side, pouting. \"He's not as cute as me. He's so fat he looks like a ball. So ugly.\" In all fairness, though Nian Bing was a bit chubby, he was still young, and with his originally handsome features, he was by no means ugly. Though Chen Chen spoke these words, she was thinking to herself, *This little fatty... he actually seems kind of fun.*",

    "content": "Nian Bing's mind was already racing. Ignoring Chenchen's attack on him, he said to the beautiful woman, \"Auntie, you really look so much like my mother. I... I...\" As he spoke, his eyes couldn't help but redden again.\n\nThe beautiful woman comforted him, \"Don't cry, child. If you'd like, Auntie can be your mother, all right?\" A maternal glow made her say it subconsciously. The moment the words left her mouth, she realized she had been a bit reckless. After all, she was completely unfamiliar with the old man and young boy before her. But, given her status, how could she take back words already spoken?\n\nNian Bing glanced at the ill-tempered Chenchen beside him and suddenly shook his head. \"That's not necessary. Thank you, Auntie, but you're not my mother, after all. I don't need pity.\" A trace of resolve showed in his eyes. In that moment, his short, stout, childish frame somehow seemed to stand a little taller.\n\nThe beautiful woman was secretly astonished. *For a child so young to have such a temperament, he is destined for great things when he grows up.* An idea struck her. She took a jade token from her robes and pressed it into Nian Bing's hand, smiling. \"It's all right. It was fate that we met. This jade token is a personal token of mine, with my name on it. If you ever run into trouble in the Oran Empire, showing this should be of some help.\"\n\n\"Mom, how could you give the Tianhua Token to him? I asked you for it so many times and you never gave it to me!\" Chenchen glared fiercely at Nian Bing. If her mother hadn't been right there, she probably would have lunged over to snatch it.\n\nThe jade token was warm and smooth to the touch, and a gentle current seemed to flow from his palm into his body, making him feel exceedingly comfortable. A grateful light shone in Nian Bing's eyes. He didn't refuse it. \"Thank you, Auntie. Auntie, you're a truly kind person.\"\n\nZha Ji, afraid that Nian Bing would inadvertently break the hypnotic seal while looking at the beautiful woman, took his hand and said to her, \"Madam, we still have to be on our way, so we'll be leaving now. Thank you for your concern for the boy.\" After speaking, he pulled Nian Bing over to a large tree on the side, pushed the wooden cart, and continued along the main road toward Ice Snow City.\n\nWatching them depart, Captain Feng walked to the beautiful woman's side and said in a low voice, \"Madam, giving the Tianhua Token to a common person like that seems a bit inappropriate. I'm afraid His Lordship will...\"\n\nThe beautiful woman snorted. \"What do you know? Have you ever seen a common child who could cast a low-level spell instantly at only ten-some years old? I have a premonition that this child will one day make a name for himself on the continent. You need to be more far-sighted, Captain Feng. I suggest you manage your own subordinates properly. Eat something and prepare to get back on the road. Chenchen, let's go back to the carriage and rest.\" With that, she took her daughter's hand, and in two flashes, they had disappeared behind the carriage curtain.\n\nCaptain Feng, having been rebuffed, showed not a trace of dissatisfaction. His gaze fell upon the subordinate who had lost his sword earlier. He walked over to him in a few steps and said coolly, \"Hand over your feather.\"\n\nThe knight's whole body trembled. He said in a panic, \"Captain, I...\"\n\nCaptain Feng's eyes grew colder. He repeated, \"Hand over your feather. I don't want to say it a third time.\"\n\nAs if drained of all his strength, the knight reverently took an azure feather, about thirty centimeters long, from his breastplate and handed it to Captain Feng.\n\nCaptain Feng said in a cold voice, \"To have your own sword taken by a child—you have lost the right to be a Silver Feather Knight. I hereby announce that from this moment on, you are demoted to Knight Apprentice. Your azure feather is confiscated. Further punishment will be decided upon our return to the order. Do you accept this?\"\n\nThe knight hung his head, looking at the faint scratch mark left by his sword on his silver armor. \"Yes, Captain.\"\n\nCaptain Feng's sharp gaze swept over the other knights. \"You should all know what your duty is,\" he said gravely. \"Upholding the honor of a knight is more important than upholding your own life. From now on, I want every one of you to give me 120 percent of your attention. If something like this happens again, the punishment will be even more severe.\"\n\n...\n\nThe conversation with the beautiful woman stirred up a strong longing for his mother in Nian Bing's heart, making him much quieter than usual. Worried that he might remember something, Zha Ji told him interesting stories from his past as they walked. Nian Bing was, after all, still a child. After a short while, he recovered from his sadness while listening to Zha Ji's tales and became his lively self again.\n\n\"Master, that auntie just now even gave me a jade token.\" When they left earlier, he had casually tucked the token into his robes in order to push the cart. The token emanated a strange aura, warm to the touch, which was one of the reasons his mood had calmed so quickly. As he spoke, Nian Bing pushed the cart with one hand and used the other to pull the jade token from his robes.\n\nThe token wasn't large. It was rectangular, its long side about the length of Nian Bing's little finger. Its entire body was a milky white, warm and smooth to the touch. The front was carved with a lifelike phoenix, and a small red gemstone was inlaid where the phoenix's eye was, serving as the perfect finishing touch that brought the entire token to life. There was a small, uniform hole at the top of the token, seemingly only big enough to thread a silk cord through. A faint white mist hovered over the entire surface of the jade, difficult to see unless one looked closely in the sunlight.\n\nZha Ji's eyes also fell on Nian Bing's hand. In his haste to get away from those people earlier, he hadn't paid attention to what the beautiful woman had given Nian Bing. Now, seeing the jade token, he couldn't help but be greatly surprised. The former Ghost Chef was a man who had seen the world. Nian Bing might not recognize its mystery, but how could he not?\n\n\"Tears of pearls under the bright moon on the sea, smoke from jade warmed by the sun on Blue Field...¹ Heavens! The precious aura is so obvious, this is clearly the famous Hetian Jade. That woman is far too generous.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned. \"Master, is Hetian Jade very valuable?\"\n\nZha Ji took the jade token from Nian Bing's hand and examined it closely, marveling, \"Of course it's valuable. And this isn't just ordinary Hetian Jade, but the rarest of its kind, Mutton Fat Jade. I used to have a friend in the jade business, and he once told me that Mutton Fat Jade is the absolute finest among jades. Its luster is contained within, its body is like congealed fat, it is hard, pure, fine, and exquisitely smooth and warm. Wearing it can cultivate one's character, soothe the emotions, and ward off evil and pestilence. It is endlessly beneficial to a person. Look at this token, doesn't it have all these characteristics? Coupled with such fine and masterful carving, it truly is a treasure. Wearing it can calm a person's state of mind. Yes, it's indeed a good thing. A peaceful heart is extremely important for a chef.\" As he spoke, he turned the token over to look at the back. There, he saw three characters carved in an ancient script: \"Yu Ruyan. That must be the name of that woman from earlier. Her name truly fits her. Still, she seems a bit too generous.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"That auntie is such a good person. When I've mastered my cooking skills, I will definitely make the most delicious food for her to try.\"\n\nZha Ji thought for a moment, then handed the jade token back to Nian Bing. \"Let's go. After we get to Ice Snow City, I'll buy you a red string to tie it around your neck. Wear it against your skin, and its effects will gradually manifest.\"\n\nThe two continued on their way. They had not gone far when the urgent, rhythmic sound of horse hooves came from behind them. Turning to look, they saw it was the same mounted party that Yu Ruyan had been with. This time, however, the party didn't stop, galloping swiftly past them. When Nian Bing's gaze turned to the carriage, he saw the curtain lift slightly, and Chenchen shot him a somewhat provocative glare. By the time Nian Bing thought to glare back, the party was already a hundred meters away.\n\nSeeing the look of displeasure on Nian Bing's face, Zha Ji let out a great laugh. \"What? Taken a fancy to the little lady? Though your statuses are worlds apart, it's not like there won't be opportunities in the future. We can talk about it when you're older.\"\n\nNian Bing snorted. \"Like I'd ever fall for her! With a temper that bossy, she's just annoying to look at.\"\n\nZha Ji smiled without a word. \"Meeting on the road is a kind of fate. Perhaps you'll really meet her again when you travel to the Oran Empire in the future. It's getting late, let's hurry. It looks like we'll have to stay the night in the city no matter what.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ A famous couplet from the poem *The Inlaid Zither* by the Tang dynasty poet Li Shangyin, used here to describe the legendary quality of the jade.",

    "content": "Ice and Snow City, the Ice Moon Empire's second-largest city. From afar, the city walls reached tens of meters high, broad and sprawling. While not exactly awe-inspiring, the entire grand city standing there gave a very steady and reliable impression. The Sky Blue River flowed past the west side of Ice and Snow City. The entire grand city was built along the river, utilizing its water resources. Although its fame wasn't comparable to Ice Moon City, the Ice Moon Empire's capital next to the Ice God Tower, it was definitely one of the economic centers of the Ice Moon Empire. Many large merchant guilds made Ice and Snow City their base. The city's population numbered in the millions, and decades of peace had made it unprecedentedly prosperous.\n\nNianbing and Chaji entered from Ice and Snow City's north gate. Dressed like ordinary commoners, they looked inconspicuous. The dozens of soldiers at the gate didn't even come over to question them, and they easily entered the city.\n\nUpon entering the city, there was an immediate difference in feeling. Peach Blossom Forest was like a secluded paradise, while Ice and Snow City presented a bustling, prosperous scene. The main roads were paved with bluestone, and shops of all kinds lined both sides, with shouts and hawking sounds endlessly filling the air. Although Nianbing had been here over a year ago, being accustomed to a quiet life, he was genuinely a little unaccustomed to it upon first entering the city.\n\n\"Master, what should we buy now?\" Nianbing asked.\n\nChaji smiled slightly and said, \"We need to buy quite a lot this time. We should buy several bags of rice to save us from having to come out all the time. Then there are some good seasonings. Oh, right, I also need to buy you an excellent knife. In a few days, you should officially start learning to cook. A chef's knife, like a warrior's sword, is the most important thing. Only with a good knife can you fully unleash your culinary skills. It would be best if we could buy a good knife with a magic gem. That way, you'll be able to use magic better to cut ingredients. I don't know about other chefs, but for me, the most important kitchen tool back then was the knife.\"\n\nAs soon as he heard Chaji was going to buy him a knife, Nianbing immediately became excited. \"That's great, Master! I finally won't have to use a firewood axe anymore. You must buy me a good one, though. But do you have money?\"\n\nChaji snorted and said, \"Remove the 'ma' [question particle]. Your Master, I, was once the dignified Ghost Chef. My savings couldn't be spent even if I lived for several lifetimes. Otherwise, how could I afford to live out my days in Peach Blossom Forest? I chose that place simply because I like peace and quiet.\"\n\nNianbing chuckled and said, \"So, that means Master is also a great magnate. Then what kind of kitchen knife do you use? I never noticed anything special about the one you usually use!\"\n\nChaji sighed and said, \"My own knife has long been sealed away. Since I'm no longer the Ghost Chef of yesteryear, how could I let a treasured knife gather dust with me? If your culinary skills can meet my requirements in the future, perhaps I'll pass it on to you.\"\n\n\"Come on, stop thinking about the knife. Even a good knife, you can't wield it now. Let's go buy rice first.\" Immediately, Chaji led Nianbing, familiar with the route, deeper into Ice and Snow City. In a short while, Nianbing's wooden cart was piled high with things: essential food, seasonings, and daily necessities. Chaji bought them in heaps, even purchasing several sets of ordinary coarse cloth clothes for himself and Nianbing to change into. Of course, he didn't forget the red string he promised Nianbing. Now, the jade plaque was worn close to his body around his neck, the smooth, warm jade resting against his chest, its faint warm aura making Nianbing feel especially comfortable.\n\nPushing the increasingly heavy cart, Nianbing complained, \"Master, I'm already hungry. Should we eat something before continuing to shop?\"\n\nChaji looked at his chubby disciple and smiled, \"You already have so much fat; skipping a meal won't hurt. Alright, we've bought almost everything we need. Let's go find an inn to stay in first, have a meal, and tonight I'll take you out to see if there's a suitable knife.\"\n\nNianbing let out a long breath, pointing to a small inn ahead. \"Master, let's stay there. I really can't walk anymore.\"\n\nChaji nodded. \"Alright. I've stayed there before. Although the environment is average, it's still quite clean.\"\n\nThe inn was named 'All Beings'. An old man and a young boy, pushing their cart, arrived at the inn entrance. A server immediately came out, smiling apologetically. \"Sirs, are you looking for a room? We have all facilities here and provide hot water twenty-four hours a day. Our prices are fair.\"\n\nChaji said impatiently, \"Alright, enough chatter. Get the cart into the courtyard first. We'll stay here.\"\n\nEntering the inn, Chaji led Nianbing to the counter. \"Give us a standard room, one with two beds.\"\n\nThe server behind the counter had an ordinary appearance, looking eighteen or nineteen years old. She smiled slightly and said, \"The price for one day's lodging is one silver coin. Please pay in advance.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, let's get two rooms,\" Nianbing said somewhat eagerly.\n\nChaji asked curiously, \"Why two rooms?\"\n\nNianbing stuck out his tongue at him. \"Master, normally when you stay next to me, your snoring often shakes my room. If we're in the same room, I won't be able to sleep. Tomorrow, I'll still have to push the cart back. Please have pity on this body of mine, which needs rest!\"\n\nChaji's old face flushed. He took out two silver coins from his embrace and handed them to the server. \"Alright, two rooms it is. Is my snoring really that loud?\" The server took the silver coins, barely suppressing her laughter, and arranged two adjacent rooms for the old man and the young boy.\n\nChaji took the room keys from the server and said to Nianbing, \"Aren't you hungry? Let's just grab something to eat here.\"\n\nThe inn's restaurant wasn't large, only a little over a hundred square meters, with a dozen or so tables neatly arranged inside. As Chaji had said, while not luxurious, it was quite clean. It wasn't mealtime, so the restaurant was very quiet. Chaji led Nianbing to a table by the street, from where they could see the bustling scene outside.\n\n\"What can I get for you two?\" a server walked up to them and asked languidly. Dressed as commoners like Nianbing and Chaji, they naturally couldn't attract her attention.\n\nChaji said, \"Four steamed buns, a bowl of plain congee, and a bit of pickled vegetables will do.\"\n\nA look of disdain flashed in the server's eyes; she couldn't even be bothered to write it down. \"Wait, it'll be right out.\"\n\nStaring dumbfounded as the server left, Nianbing shrieked, \"Master, you're kidding, right? Didn't you just say how incredibly rich you are? Why are you so stingy now? Just eating steamed buns, how is that enough nutrition!\"\n\nChaji said exasperatedly, \"Idiot, do you think I can get used to eating these things outside? After eating my cooking, if you eat the food from a normal small restaurant like this, I guarantee you'll immediately throw it up.\"\n\nNianbing asked doubtfully, \"Master, I know you're the dignified Ghost Chef, but you don't need to belittle others like that, do you? Even if it's not as delicious as yours, it wouldn't be too bad; otherwise, how would they have become chefs?\"\n\nChaji smiled oddly. \"You don't believe me, do you? Alright, then we'll order two servings of green vegetables, and you'll see for yourself. If there wasn't a huge gap between me and ordinary chefs, how could I have won five consecutive Chef God Competitions?\" Immediately, he called over the server and added two servings of green vegetables to the order.\n\nAlthough the server's attitude wasn't great, green vegetables were easy to make, and the steamed buns and congee were already prepared, so they were brought over shortly. Nianbing had been hungry for a long time and, disbelieving, immediately picked up a large chopstick-full of green vegetables and put them into his mouth.\n\n\"Ugh, ptui, ptui, ptui!\" Before he had even chewed twice, he spit out all the green vegetables. \"What is this stuff?! It tastes awful! It's all raw oil flavor; the oil definitely wasn't hot when they stir-fried it. The heat was too low, it's not even cooked through, and the vegetable's own fresh aroma hasn't come out at all. They also put in so much salt and MSG; it's absolutely dreadful!\"\n\nChaji didn't mock Nianbing. Instead, he nodded in satisfaction. \"Hmm, good. It seems you haven't wasted your year of learning with me. You've basically pointed out all the flaws in this dish. Seeing that you still have some talent, Master will show you a thing or two today. Server!\"",

    "content": "The waitress at the side, having heard Nian Bing call the food terrible, had long since grown impatient. She snapped, “What is it now? This is just how our food tastes here. If you want something good, you can go to the Dacheng Pavilion or the Qingfeng Abode in the city. The food there is delicious, but I’m afraid you can’t afford it.”\n\nZha Ji swept a cold glance over her and casually tossed out a gold coin. “Enough nonsense. Take us to the kitchen. We'll use your ingredients to cook a dish for ourselves. Just one dish.”\n\nSeeing the shiny gold coin in her hand, the waitress’s eyes instantly lit up. “Sir, you... this way, please.” A single gold coin could pay for an entire banquet. For them to cook just one dish, even if they used some of the better ingredients, there was still a huge profit to be made.\n\nThe kitchen was separated from the dining area by only a single wall. While the kitchen couldn’t be called crude, Zha Ji couldn’t help but frown upon seeing the utensils, which had clearly been in use for a long time. There were only two cooks inside, evidently the ones who had made the food Zha Ji and Nian Bing had just eaten.\n\nThe waitress went over to one of the cooks and whispered a few words in his ear. The cook frowned, gave Zha Ji a curious glance, and said impatiently, “Whatever. The ingredients are all here. We’d be happy for the break. Brother, come on, let’s go rest for a bit.” With that, he and the other cook left the kitchen to cool off in the backyard.\n\nZha Ji’s gaze fell upon Nian Bing. Leaning down, he whispered in his ear, “Today, I will teach you your first dish. How long can you sustain your Flame Art?”\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment and said, “If I only use Flame Art, an hour is no problem.”\n\n“Good. Then let’s begin. Get an iron pot and scrub it clean.”\n\nNian Bing acknowledged with a sound. Although he didn’t know what Zha Ji was planning, he immediately took an iron pot from the side and washed it clean. While he was doing this, Zha Ji had already walked over to where the ingredients were stored. They had obviously all been washed. His eyes swept over them, and he picked out a few items, placing them on the cutting board. He then identified the scents of the various seasonings on the kitchen counter.\n\n“Cut the vegetables. Everything except the tomatoes should be cut into strips.”\n\n“Yes, Master.” Nian Bing casually picked up a kitchen knife. The moment the knife was in his hand, his expression became focused. His year of hard training had not been in vain. The feeling of becoming one with the knife made the eleven-year-old’s gaze turn sharp. In his eyes, the various ingredients were not much different from firewood, merely of different sizes. His chubby little hands brought the ingredients before him one by one. With a flash of the blade, the waitress couldn’t even see how Nian Bing moved. Whether it was potatoes, carrots, or onions, they were all transformed into neat pieces. In the space of just a few blinks, Nian Bing had easily finished the task.\n\nZha Ji smiled faintly and handed Nian Bing an empty spice box. “Seasoning is a very important component of the culinary arts. This dish does not have high technical requirements, so I’ll leave it all to you. Mince the tomatoes, shrimp, and oysters into a paste. Put them all in this spice box.”\n\n“Oh.” Acknowledging the command, Nian Bing followed Zha Ji’s instructions, his knife moving like a blur. The fine, crisp rhythm of the blade hitting the cutting board filled the air. Zha Ji was not idle either; he used another spice box to mix different seasonings, stirring them evenly. By the time Nian Bing had finished his work, Zha Ji had also prepared everything. He poured the blended sauce into the paste of tomato, shrimp, and oyster. He then tossed Nian Bing a pair of chopsticks. “Stir it evenly.”\n\nWith everything prepared, Zha Ji smiled faintly. “Now, we officially begin.” He picked up a small brush and threw it to Nian Bing, his eyes filled with a focused light, his speech suddenly quickening. “Spread one-third of the sauce on the bottom of the pot. Place the chopped ingredients on top, then brush another third of the sauce over them.”\n\nAlthough this was Nian Bing’s first time cooking, he had often observed cooks at work and was not unfamiliar with their tasks. Though he was a bit clumsy at first, he quickly completed everything.\n\nZha Ji took a plate of sliced fish fillets and placed them in the pot, which was already coated with sauce. “Waitress, please step outside for a moment.” He was not about to let the waitress discover that Nian Bing could use magic.\n\nThe waitress hesitated. “But…”\n\nZha Ji said impatiently, “Don’t worry, we’re not going to burn down your kitchen.”\n\nBecause of the gold coin Zha Ji had given her earlier, the waitress didn’t dare say more and had no choice but to exit the kitchen, leaving only Nian Bing and Zha Ji inside.\n\nZha Ji smiled faintly. “Brush the rest of the sauce on top. Heat the pot with your flames.”\n\n“Oh, passionate elements of fire, I beseech you, gather into the light of a flame and bring warmth to the world! Flame Art.” A red flame lit up from Nian Bing’s right hand. He held the pot with his left, letting the flame burn directly under its center.\n\nZha Ji smiled faintly and said, “Your magic flame is hotter than an ordinary flame, and the heat is more even, so we’ll be able to eat sooner. Have you memorized the steps I just taught you? This is the simplest of dishes, called Three-Sauce Braised Fish. Since the ingredients here are ordinary, the flavor might be a bit lacking, but it will have to do.”\n\nWhile maintaining the flame, Nian Bing asked Zha Ji, “Master, aren’t you afraid that waitress from before will learn how to make it?”\n\nZha Ji smiled faintly. “The seasoning blend is my own creation, using more than ten different spices. Do you think she can remember them all? Besides, the amount of each seasoning is also very particular. It’s not so easy to learn. Keep your fire steady. We can eat in half an incense stick’s time¹ at most. The key to this dish is the sauce. The so-called three sauces are the base sauce, the seafood sauce, and the tomato sauce. With a foundation of potatoes, carrots, and onions, the three layers and three sauces infuse their flavors simultaneously, which, combined with the natural freshness of the fish, brings out the essence of the dish. As for the specific recipe for the three sauces, I’ll teach you in detail when we get back.” As he spoke, he took a lid from the side and placed it on the iron pot.\n\nNian Bing used a low-level ice magic to protect his left hand from being burned by the hot pot. Under the searing flame, it wasn’t long before a fragrance began to escape from the iron pot, a rich aroma that made Nian Bing swallow hard.\n\nAfter half an incense stick’s time.\n\n“That smells amazing! What is that smell?”\n\n“Yeah! It’s incredible. I’ve never smelled a dish this fragrant. Could that old man have made it?”\n\nThe two cooks who had gone outside to cool off ran back in. As soon as they entered, they saw Nian Bing holding the iron pot with both hands, the source of the wonderful smell. Zha Ji glanced at the two cooks and said indifferently, “There is no need to taste the dish. One look at the person is enough.”\n\nThe two cooks didn't seem to hear Zha Ji’s words. Their eyes were fixed on the iron pot, and like Nian Bing before, they were gulping down saliva. One of them said, “Hey, what is this you’ve made? It smells so good!”\n\nNian Bing was about to answer but was stopped by Zha Ji. He looked at Nian Bing and said, “Remember, you must also consider who you are cooking for. Not just anyone has the right to eat what we make. A chef has his dignity. We only create food for those who are worthy of it. Let’s go.”\n\nYou could tell how delicious the Three-Sauce Braised Fish was just by the way Nian Bing was eating. Of the entire large pot, he had polished off at least eighty percent of it himself, along with two steamed buns, enjoying himself to his heart's content. By the time the battle was over, his clothes were stained with sauce in many places. Besides the fish bones, only a few dregs of sauce were left in the pot. The waitress standing by watched with wide eyes.\n\n“Master, I admire you more and more. This was just too delicious. I really don’t know what I’ll do without you in the future,” Nian Bing said, patting his protruding belly and moaning with satisfaction.\n\nZha Ji chuckled. “Don’t worry, you’ll find out what to do soon enough. If you want to eat well for the rest of your life, you can’t rely on others. You can only rely on yourself.”\n\nNian Bing had a vague sense that something was amiss, but knowing Zha Ji, he knew his master wouldn’t tell him even if he asked. It seemed his days would not be so easy after they returned.\n\nLooking at his filthy, precious disciple, Zha Ji said irritably, “Are you going back to sleep now, or are you coming with me to check out the weaponsmiths and find you a suitable knife?”\n\nNian Bing’s eyes lit up. “I’ll go, of course I’ll go. Master, let’s go right now.”\n\nZha Ji put on a profound look. “Before we ate, didn’t someone say he was too tired to even walk? How do you have so much energy now?”\n\nNian Bing giggled. “Master, I know you’re the best. I’ve got motivation now, don’t I? The sooner I get my own precious knife, the sooner I can get familiar with its nature!”\n\nZha Ji stood up. “Then hurry back and change your clothes. Going out like this is an embarrassment to me.”\n\n“Yes, yes, I’ll go right now.” Nian Bing demonstrated a speed completely disproportionate to his size, darting towards the inn’s backyard to get his clothes.\n\nBy the time Zha Ji and Nian Bing appeared on the streets of Ice Snow City, the sky was gradually darkening. In the distance, a bank of clouds, illuminated by the sun’s afterglow, created a final, beautiful crimson sunset, casting a lingering radiance over the streets.\n\nAfter walking for a while, Nian Bing pointed to a large shop not far ahead. “Master, that’s a weapon shop, isn’t it? Let’s go take a look!” The sword-shaped sign above the shop's entrance was very eye-catching, with the three large characters for “Precious Artifacts Pavilion” written on it. Although it was already dusk, customers were still coming and going in an endless stream, a testament to its booming business.\n\nZha Ji casually pinched the fat on Nian Bing’s cheek. “Idiot. If you try to buy a kitchen knife in a place like this, you’ll be lucky if they don’t kick you out.”\n\nNian Bing rubbed his chubby little face. “How was I supposed to know? Didn’t you say we were going to a weapon shop?”\n\nZha Ji got his bearings. “Follow me. It’s a weapon shop, but not this one.” As he spoke, he pulled Nian Bing into a small alley nearby. He seemed very familiar with the area, leading Nian Bing through streets and winding alleys. They walked for about the time it takes to eat a meal, and by the time the sky had completely darkened, Zha Ji finally stopped, panting slightly. He pointed ahead and said, “This is it.”\n\n***\n¹ A traditional Chinese way of measuring time, roughly 15 minutes.",

    "content": "\"This... here...? Master, are you sure this is the place?\" Nian Bing rubbed his eyes, making sure he hadn't misunderstood Zha Ji.\n\nIt was no wonder Nian Bing was so astonished. Before him were two doors—or to be more precise, two rather dilapidated wooden doors. Only one handle remained, the paint on the lintel had long since peeled away, and a sign leaned crookedly to the side. He could vaguely make out the five slanted characters written on it: Shoddy Ironware Shop.\n\nGoing by the name alone, it was unlikely anyone would ever patronize the place, let alone the fact that the shop was tucked away in a remote corner where probably only a few people passed by each day. The run-down sight made Nian Bing want to turn around and leave on the spot.\n\nZha Ji looked at the sign, a knowing smile gracing his lips. \"Old friend, I've come to see you again. It's been a year. I wonder if you're dead yet.\"\n\nNian Bing asked in surprise, \"Master, you know the owner of this place?\"\n\nZha Ji said, \"Of course I do. Why else would I have brought you here? Nian Bing, you must remember this: no matter what you do, never be deceived by outward appearances. Though the storefront is shabby, who besides me could possibly know that this so-called Shoddy Ironware Shop is home to a master blacksmith—the greatest master blacksmith in the world?\"\n\n\"The greatest master blacksmith in the world? Master, you can't be joking. If he were truly the greatest master blacksmith in the world, would he live in a place like this?\"\n\nZha Ji smiled faintly. \"And why not? The Ghost Chef can live in a Peach Blossom Forest so remote that not even birds lay eggs there, so why can't the Divine Smith live in a dilapidated courtyard? Come on, let's go in first.\" As he spoke, he pulled Nian Bing to the door. Instead of knocking, he sent a kick straight into the ramshackle wooden door. With a dull *thump*, the door, which looked ready to fall apart, swung inward completely unharmed, revealing a pitch-dark little courtyard.\n\n\"Little Broken Blade, are you dead yet?\" Zha Ji yelled.\n\nAn ancient voice drifted from the depths of the courtyard. \"I was wondering who could be so impolite. Turns out it's you again, you old ghost.\" A staggering figure emerged from the courtyard, carrying a dimly lit oil lamp. Without even needing to see his face, one could tell he was a man with one foot in the grave. *This is the so-called greatest master blacksmith in the world?* Nian Bing thought to himself. *Master couldn't have made a mistake, could he?*\n\nZha Ji pulled Nian Bing into the courtyard. By the dim yellow light of the oil lamp, Nian Bing could vaguely make out that it was an old man dressed in a long black robe. His figure was already somewhat stooped, his hair was snow-white, and his face was covered in wrinkles. He looked at least ten years older than Zha Ji.\n\n\"Old ghost, why'd you bring someone with you this time? Who is this little fatty?\" the old man in black said, looking at Nian Bing with some displeasure.\n\n\"Little Broken Blade, this is my new apprentice. I think it's about time you found a child to pass your legacy on to as well. Or are you really planning to take everything with you to the grave?\"\n\nThe old man in black snorted. \"What the hell do you know? It all depends on fate. You think you can take on an apprentice just because you feel like it? Looking at this apprentice of yours, he certainly looks like a good eater. A perfect match for you.\"\n\nHearing this, Nian Bing felt a bit displeased, but since it was a conversation between his elders, he couldn't very well interrupt. He strained his eyes to look around and found that the small courtyard was almost empty. There wasn't even the weapon rack he had imagined; only a large, furnace-like object stood in a corner.\n\nZha Ji laughed heartily. \"You old codger, haven't seen you in years and you're still the same sarcastic old grouch. Alright, cut the nonsense. You know I must have a reason for coming to find you.\"\n\nThe old man in black said, \"Then come on in.\" He led Zha Ji toward the back room. The moment he stepped inside, Nian Bing suddenly felt a chill run through his entire body. The Ice and Snow Goddess's Stone stirred for no reason, his mind felt a little dizzy, and the two types of magic power within him fluctuated unstably. Alarmed, he thought to himself, *This must be because I used a Fire Art spell without using an equivalent ice-type spell to balance the magic in my body.* But this wasn't the right time or place to use an ice spell. What's more, his magic powers were in some chaos from clashing with each other, and he didn't know how much ice magic he would need to restore the balance. Relying on his willpower, he forcibly controlled the two streams of magic, trying his best to separate them. Just then, the Heavenly Splendor Amulet that Yu Ruyan had given him released a warm current that flowed into his body, making him feel much more comfortable. The extreme sensations of cold and heat immediately subsided.\n\nThe old man in black used the oil lamp to light a lamp on the table, and the room instantly brightened. This was the outer room. In the center was a high counter, and behind it, there seemed to be another doorway. The old man walked behind the counter, rubbed his fingers together at Zha Ji, and said, \"Money. How much you're willing to pay is how much the item will be worth.\"\n\nZha Ji said irritably, \"Little Broken Blade, after all these years, you still love money just as much.\"\n\nThe old man in black snorted. \"Friends are friends, business is business. Since you can no longer make the Eight Treasures of Rare Flavors,¹ you'll just have to pay with money. In business, everyone is equal.\"\n\nZha Ji walked up to the counter, leaned in close to the old man, and said, \"Don't play games with me. Get a good knife for this precious apprentice of mine. Once he's completed his training, won't you be able to eat the Eight Treasures of Rare Flavors again?\"\n\nThe old man's eyes lit up, but they quickly dimmed again. \"Easy for you to say. By the time this precious apprentice of yours completes his training, this old life of mine will probably have already ascended to the heavens.\"\n\nZha Ji chuckled. \"That's not necessarily true! You were in this sorry state when I saw you years ago, and you're still the same now. I'd say you've got another ten or twenty years in you, no problem.\"\n\nThe old man sighed. \"I know my own body. In this life, I have offended Heaven too many times. If your apprentice can finish his training within ten years, perhaps I'll still be around to get a taste.\"\n\nZha Ji laughed. \"If you die, you die. Even I don't know if I'll live another ten years. Enough with the nonsense, hurry up and get my apprentice a knife. Just name your price.\"\n\nThe old man in black glanced at Nian Bing and said, \"No.\"\n\nZha Ji's brow furrowed slightly. \"Little Broken Blade, you're not even going to do me this small favor?\"\n\nThe old man snorted. \"It's not that I won't do you a favor, don't you get it? Whether it's a kitchen knife or a battle knife for killing, it must suit the user. This chubby apprentice of yours hasn't finished growing yet. Both his body and his knife-wielding hand are likely to change a lot in the future. Forging a knife for him now would be completely meaningless. It will become unsuitable for him when he's older.\"\n\nWhen Nian Bing heard that the old man refused to forge a knife for him, he grew anxious. \"Then you can just make one for me in an adult's size. I can definitely use it.\"\n\nThe old man glanced at him. \"Like master, like apprentice. Do you think the knives I forge are the same as those made by common hacks? If the knife doesn't match the person, what's the use of having it? Your own knife is like your underwear; only when it's a perfect fit can it be wielded to its greatest effect. If you buy a pair of ill-fitting underwear, you might feel comfortable after wearing it for a few days, but that's not because the underwear is any good, it's because you've adapted to it. An adapted fit and a perfect fit from the start are worlds apart. Come back when you're eighteen and your body has finished developing. Let's hope I'm not dead by then.\"\n\nA thoughtful look appeared in Zha Ji's eyes. \"It seems I was careless. Old friend, let's talk about it some other time, then. How about you let me see your armory? Have you made any good pieces lately?\"\n\n***\n¹**Eight Treasures of Rare Flavors (珍味八饈):** A term for a magnificent, multi-course feast featuring the rarest and most delicious delicacies.",

    "content": "The old man in black said helplessly, \"I am old. Although my skills are more exquisite with my experience, my physical strength is no longer good. I don't have the energy to collect good materials and create something good. To put it, the most proud work in my life is the Zhengyang with the magic of fire that I have attached to. Unfortunately, I only have that satisfactory knife in this life. Since you want to see it, then follow it. It's not much to give your fat disciple a first choice.\" As he said, he turned around and walked towards the room behind the cabinet.\n\n\n\nNian Bing and Chat roamed over the counter and followed the old man in black into the door. As soon as they entered the door, Nian Bing's brain felt dizzy again. The wave of the Stone of the Snow Goddess this time became even more intense. He couldn't bear the cold and cold atmosphere that he could not bear the ice-type magic. He subconsciously touched the stone in his mind.\n\n\n\nCha said with great praise: \"I have such a strong killing spirit, and I am worthy of being the number one god in the mainland.\"\n\n\n\nThe old man in black walked to the cabinet next to him, opened the cabinet, and said, \"There are only these seven knives I left behind. Look at it and choose. The price will be given to you a hundred.\"\n\n\n\nSeven sheathless knives were hung inside the cabinet. Each one had a different style. Under the illumination of the oil lamp, a cold light shone everywhere, and a faint coldness rolled over. The spear of the seven swords was hidden in the blue-like light. The style was ancient, and when I looked at it, I couldn't find a flaw. As soon as the counter opened, Nian Bing's eyes fell on the knife on the far left side, and looked at it for a moment. The knife was the most inconspicuous and shortest of all seven knives. Under the illumination of the oil lamp, only it has no reflection of light. The light on the blade is dim, about one foot or two inches long, of which the handle is five inches long and black. The flow line of the blade is extremely beautiful. The blade is straight, the tip is slightly raised, the blade is two inches wide, and the back of the blade looks very thick. The reason why Nian Bing was attracted to it was entirely because of its breath. It was a feeling from the heart, as if the knife should have belonged to him, and the chill of the Stone of the Snow Goddess Stone became even stronger, as if it was swearing something. \n\n\n\nNian Bing walked towards the cabinet step by step with a dull look at him, but was stopped by the old man in black. \"It was the knife he used, so let him choose it himself. Well, it seems that this kid has a good knife and has made his own decision.\" When he said that, he suddenly realized that Nian Bing reached out to the short knife on the far left side of the cabinet, and couldn't help but exclaim.\n\n\n\nThe check was very clear that these seven knives must be good and bad. With the same price, choosing is naturally extremely important. Seeing that his fat apprentice actually chose the most inconspicuous one, he couldn't help but feel confused and turned his head to the old man in black. When he thought that his old friend would definitely be in a happy face at this time. However, when he saw the expression on the face of the old man in black, he couldn't help but be stunned. At this time, the old man in black was staring at Nian Bing's hands with wide eyes, his lips buzzing, as if he wanted to say something, but he couldn't say it.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's son was not tall, so he pinched the tip of the knife in front of him and lifted it upwards, and took off the inconspicuous short knife.When he got the knife, a cold current immediately spread, making him feel nervous, but the magic power fluctuations in his body seemed to be more intense. Holding the threaded shank and looking carefully, I saw a diamond-shaped hole in the shank. As soon as I started, I clearly felt that the ice-type magic power in my body seemed to be completely connected to this knife. The knife became an extension of the left arm. The ice-type magic power did not need to be urged, and it flowed naturally in. A faint blue light was emitting from the entire knife.\n\n\n\n\"Master, I'm going to do this.\" Nian Bingsu used his short knife to sway, bringing light blue light, and the temperature in the entire room seemed to have dropped a few points.\n\n\n\nAs soon as Chau saw the light radiating from the blade, he thought about the expression on the face of the old man in black. He couldn't help but laugh and said, \"You fat boy, seem to be a mistake. The little broken knife is going to be this.\"\n\n\n\nThe old man in black looked at Nian Bing in surprise. Suddenly, his body flashed forward, and it turned out like an electric fire. In the blink of an eye, he came to Nian Bing and reached out to grab the short blade in his hand.\n\n\n\nNian Bing was startled, almost an instinctive reaction. She flipped her left hand and turned the blade towards the old man in black. The cold breath spread out. Unfortunately, her left hand was not the right hand that had been trained for a long time. She only felt that she had just turned light in her hand and the knife fell into the old man in black. Nian Bingyi was stunned, \"Foreign, what are you fucking?\"\n\n\n\nChaqi walked to Nian Bing's side, pressed his shoulder and said, \"Little Breaking Knife, you won't be too lonely. What kind of knife is this?\"\n\n\n\nThe old man in black gently slapped his blade and sighed helplessly, saying, \"To be honest, I never expected that your fat disciple would choose this one. This is the worst of the seven swords!\"\n\n\n\nChasing the stern eyebrows said, \"Why is it so bad when the knife looks bad? If you don't let it go, I won't be able to be strong.\"\n\n\n\nThe old man in black said unhappily, \"Do you think I am not willing to do it? What I, the god Huatian, said, is not counted. Since you have said that you have chosen by yourself, what you choose is what. This knife is indeed the worst of the seven swords. Moreover, it is the only one that I did not make. The reason why there is light is that is your disciple. If I didn't see anything wrong, you should have practiced ice magic, otherwise it would be impossible to draw out the sword light. Old ghost! I didn't expect you to really cultivate a magician's messenger.\"\n\n\n\nCha Qi smiled and said, \"It's just a big difference. Just the difference is worse. Anyway, you said Nian Bing is still small, so you can just change it in the future.\"\n\n\n\nThe old man in black said, \"I haven't finished it yet. Although this knife is the worst of the seven swords, it can also be said to be the best. Because I can't even understand its knife nature. At the beginning, this cold knife was purchased from a down-and-out bookmaker and only cost a gold coins. The knife is made of a special mineral, which is very rude and the most peculiar thing is its own cold nature. If there is ice magic or cold fighting, it will emit the light like it was before, but do you know why I said it is the worst? Because this knife has no soul.\"\n\n\n\n\"Soulless?\"Nian Bing and Cha said in a loud voice. Both of them had doubts.\n\n\n\nThe old man in black, Hua Tian said, \"It's true, this knife has no soul. Little fat man, how old am I this year?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was waiting for the old man in black to explain it. When he heard him turn the question, he said subconsciously: \"You? You should be a little older than my teacher.\"\n\n\n\nHuatian laughed loudly, \"Little fat man, you are so kind. If you change to someone else, you may say that I am more than ten years older than your teacher. But in fact, I am more than three years younger than your teacher. I have been practicing my temper since I was a little older. According to normal circumstances, I should have aged much slower than ordinary people. However, now I look twenty years older than I am in my actual age. . Why is this? Because when I was cast, I used essence and blood as my soul and merged into my weapons. This method of exorcising the heavens made my essence very eroded, which turned out to be like this now. And this cold knife, the sword soul that was induced by essence and blood, and the soulless sword, even if the material is good, it will eventually not reach the ultimate level. Therefore, although its material is the best, its quality is the worst.\"\n\n\n\nChau said, \"With your creation art, just rebuild this knife. Wouldn't you give it a soul to achieve another great quality?\"\n\n\n\nHuatian smiled bitterly and said, \"You can even think of it, but how could I not think of it. But I have tried many times, even if I use the Jiuwu Tianhuo, I cannot burn this knife. How can you re-create it? With my understanding of metal, I cannot tell where it comes from, so I can only store it first. If there is no soul, there is no soul. Anyway, you just use it as a kitchen knife. This knife is like mud, so cutting vegetables is naturally not the same. However, be careful not to cut the chopping board.\" As he said, he re-passed the knife to Nianbing.\n\n\n\nNian Bing took the knife and felt that he was united with his body again. \"When I go forward, can I not have the method to give it the sword soul?\"\n\n\n\nHua Tiandao: \"There is no way. If you can find a spiritual stone that is embedded in the hole in the handle of the knife, and use the stone as the soul, it is not impossible. Then the effect may be better. However, if the stone is not a good product, the stone will be embedded in it, and the road will be full of red.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's heart was moved, isn't the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess a diamond-shaped one? The size seemed to be similar to the hole in the hilt. After hesitating for a moment, he took out the Snow Goddess Stone from the slightest and said, \"Forward, do you think this is the way?\" As soon as the Snow Goddess Stone came out, a group of light blue light lit up in the whole room. The cold knife made a tingling sound, and it turned out to be as if it was alive. It was shaking slightly in Nian Bing's hands. Although the stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess also had light scattered, it was definitely not as bright as it is today. The stones and swords intersected, as if they were calling each other.",

    "content": "The matter of another website having the first six chapters of this book was a misunderstanding. New Blue Net is run by Xiao San's traditional Chinese publisher. As this is the first book of the month, they posted the first six chapters as a promotion, which subsequently led to them being reposted by some unscrupulous people. Xiao San only found out about this last night. I will now post those six chapters here as well and, at the same time, promise everyone that this book's absolute debut is on Qidian, and a similar situation will not happen again. Please add this book to your collections and cast your precious recommendation votes for it. At the same time, for this month's VIP votes, Xiao San hopes everyone can continue to support *Kong Su* and transfer them over here after this book goes on sale.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotice: The post-highlighting assembly scheduled for this Sunday at 12:05 AM will be held here instead. Everyone is welcome to join us in the book review section at that time.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"This is, this is...\" Hua Tian's face filled with excitement. He snatched the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess from Nian Bing's hand, and feeling the intense chill emanating from within, he couldn't help but shout in joyful surprise, \"What an exquisite, high-grade ice stone! Little fatty, where did you get this?\"\n\nNian Bing glanced at Zha Ji and said, \"It seems I've had it for a while. I don't know where it came from.\"\n\nZha Ji looked at him, somewhat surprised, and said, \"So it was on you all along? How come I never heard you mention it.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Master, I only knew that using this gemstone made practicing magic faster. You never asked me about it, so naturally I never said anything. Senior, can this be inlaid?\"\n\nHua Tian slowly closed his eyes, sensing the surging spirituality within the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess. His voice trembled slightly. \"Yes, of course, it can. Their mutual calling has already proven everything. Oh, heavens! Are you truly going to grant my wish? With such fine materials, I can finally forge a Heaven-Seizing Blade. To think that I, Hua Tian, have dedicated my life to smithing and have finally waited for this day. Come with me.\"\n\nHis figure flashed, and Hua Tian rushed out of the inner room. Zha Ji glanced at Nian Bing, who looked back at him with a somewhat bewildered expression. Zha Ji said, \"Let's go. It seems you're a lucky kid.\"\n\nWhen they arrived in the courtyard, the furnace that had originally been in a corner had been moved to the center. Hua Tian, having produced a bellows from somewhere, connected it to the bottom of the furnace. He poured a bag of powder into the furnace and turned his head to Nian Bing. \"Little fatty, come over and help me work the bellows. Although the Nine Departures Heavenly Fire cannot melt the Chill Blade, it can soften its texture. That will be the moment for the inlay. Nine Departures Dou Qi, rise.\" A scorching aura radiated from Hua Tian's entire body. Fortunately, Nian Bing was on the other side of the furnace and wasn't affected by the heat. A faint red light appeared around his body. He pointed a finger forward, and a ray of red light shot into the furnace. The furnace fire roared to life, but it was not an ordinary red flame. The flame was white, illuminating the entire courtyard brightly.\n\n\"Work the bellows!\" Hua Tian bellowed. He pinched the tip of the Chill Blade with his left hand, extending the hilt over the furnace fire. His right hand faced the fire from a distance, continuously injecting scorching Nine Departures Dou Qi into it.\n\nThis was the first time Nian Bing had ever seen Dou Qi, and his interest was immediately piqued. He pumped the bellows with all his might while watching Hua Tian display his power.\n\nIt was unknown what the furnace was made of. Although the flames within were clearly at an extremely high temperature, not much heat could be felt on the outside. The flame gradually shifted from white to cyan. Amidst the forging, the Chill Blade's hilt remained its original color, showing no change. Fine beads of sweat began to appear on Hua Tian's forehead, and the red aura around his body also began to shift toward cyan. The furnace fire grew increasingly cyan, and by the time the Dou Qi around Hua Tian's body had completely turned cyan, the flames had transformed into a dark green that was extremely eerie to behold. Within this dark green flame, the hilt of the Chill Blade finally began to change, turning slightly red. The flame passed through the hollow at the end of the hilt, which, under Hua Tian's deliberate control, received the heat most evenly.\n\n\"With blood as the catalyst, Nine Departures Heavenly Fire!\" Hua Tian suddenly spat a mouthful of blood into the fire. The dark green flames abruptly retracted, and then, in an instant, the dark green transformed into a brilliant red as the flames surged up once more. At that very moment, the entire hilt of the Chill Blade turned the same shade of red as the fire. With a flick of his wrist, Hua Tian sent the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess shooting out. It landed precisely in the hollow. The softened hilt let out a piercing hiss, and steam billowed up. The entire furnace fire dimmed in an instant as a layer of azure-blue light floated upwards, its misty aura soaring into the sky.\n\nPinching the blade's tip, Hua Tian's body suddenly flashed to Nian Bing's side. The Nine Departures Dou Qi around him had already receded. His left hand abruptly grabbed Nian Bing from the ground. Nian Bing felt a powerful force, followed by a warmth at his wrist, as if something was flowing out. Zha Ji, standing to the side, saw clearly that Hua Tian had used his fingernail to slice open Nian Bing's wrist vein. A stream of fresh blood shot directly onto the junction where the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess was inlaid into the Chill Blade. The blood was swiftly absorbed by the hilt, and the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess was perfectly embedded within it. The red color vanished. The Chill Blade transformed from its original black to an azure-blue. Its sheen was like autumn water, and a chilling aura radiated in all directions. The light from the blade shot up into the heavens, straight into the ninth celestial layer.¹ In that instant, the entire sky brightened. Though it lasted for only a brief moment, it signified the birth of a peerless, treasured blade.\n\n...\n\nIce Snow City, Martial Arts Guild branch. A richly dressed old man with a longsword at his waist stood with his hands behind his back on the roof of the guild hall. His body was as steady as a rock, his star-like eyes gazing into the distance, seemingly lost in thought. Just then, he was startled to see an azure-blue brilliance shoot into the sky not far away. Within the azure-blue aura, there seemed to be a faint thread of red. The sharpness of the aura carried such a distinct coldness that his heart lurched in shock. When he tried to find it again, the azure-blue light had already vanished. He drew in a sharp breath. \"A divine weapon's birth reveals a bloody light. Is the continent to be plunged into turmoil again?\"\n\nThe longsword in the green sharkskin scabbard at his waist hummed once before returning to stillness. The richly dressed old man patted it. \"Old friend, you seem to be afraid. What kind of divine weapon has just been born to instill such fear in you? You and I are one in mind and spirit. With my power as a Martial Sage, should I fear a mere divine weapon? Even a divine weapon's power depends on whose hands it is in!\"\n\n...\n\nIce God Tower.\n\nIn the center of a blue hexagram more than ten meters in diameter, a blue light surged. A woman with snow-white hair abruptly opened her eyes. Though her hair was as white as snow, her exquisitely beautiful face was like that of a young maiden. Her pair of blue eyes were filled with a cold, clear air, and the white, gold-trimmed robe she wore bespoke her noble status. With a beckoning motion of her right hand, a transparent crystal ball appeared in her palm. \"This is the sound of the Goddess's moan. Could it be that the Tower-Guarding Stone was not lost in the Azure River? In the name of the Ice and Snow Goddess, receive it, the Goddess's aura.\"\n\nA white light suddenly flared, and a layer of mist appeared on the crystal ball. A spot of azure-blue light suddenly lit up within the mist. With a soft *ding*, the woman's hand trembled, and the crystal ball actually shattered into pieces before her. \"What a piercing aura. It is indeed the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess. Hmph. Someone, come.\" Her voice was not loud, but it seemed to possess a soul-shaking resonance. The massive doors opened, and two women in long white robes walked in from outside. They appeared to be in their sixties or seventies, their faces deeply lined with wrinkles, looking quite old.\n\n\"Great Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess, what are your commands?\"\n\nThe white-haired woman's figure floated up. She said indifferently, \"I have sensed the location of the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess. Immediately dispatch the twelve Ice and Snow Priests from the Tower. The two of you will personally lead the team to Ice Snow City. You must retrieve the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess. The Goddess's dignity will not be profaned by anyone.\"\n\n\"Yes, Great Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess.\" After bowing in salute, the two old women exited the room. A cold glint shone in the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's eyes, and a blue mist rose around her body. \"Ling'er, why must you do this? Is love truly that important to you? With your aptitude, if you were willing to let go of everything and accept my teachings, the position of God-Descended Master would surely have been yours within twenty years. Why must you suffer like this?\" With a long sigh, the surrounding atmosphere fluctuated, and a layer of solid ice a foot thick actually condensed on the room's walls.\n\n...\n\nShoddy Goods Weapon Shop. Hua Tian sat on the ground, panting heavily. His face was deathly pale, clearly exhausted, but his turbid old eyes were filled with excitement and joy. Looking at the dewdrop condensed from white mist on the short blade in his hand, his voice trembled. \"Success. It's a success. Autumn Water White Dew, what a peerless divine blade. I never imagined this ice stone would have an even stronger spirituality than I thought. I've finally created a peerless divine blade, finally caught up to the Divine Blacksmiths of history. Haha, hahahaha.\"\n\nNian Bing clutched his wrist, muttering, \"Gentle waters, I pray you soothe this wound with your soft smile. Healing Spell.\" A faint blue light caressed the wound on his wrist, and it healed in an instant. Though a scar remained, the bleeding had stopped. Water and ice shared the same origin; a first-tier Healing Spell was no difficult task for Nian Bing.\n\nHua Tian shakily got to his feet. Gazing at the blade in his hand, his eyes fell on Nian Bing. \"Little fatty, I used your blood to consecrate this blade. From now on, only you will be able to unleash its full power. You must treat this blade well. Frankly, I can't bear to give it to you. To let such a divine blade become a kitchen knife... it's a true pearl covered in dust!\"\n\nZha Ji laughed loudly. \"Covered in your head! Wasn't that gemstone my disciple's to begin with? Without the ice stone, you couldn't have forged such a fine blade no matter how skilled you are. Stop with the nonsense. One hundred purple-gold coins, right? Here.\" Saying this, he took out a money pouch from his robes and tossed it to Hua Tian.\n\nHua Tian snorted and threw the pouch back at Zha Ji. \"How can the birth of such a treasured blade be tainted by the stink of money? I'll let you off easy this time. However, I suggest your disciple wrap the hilt in cloth. Don't let the gemstone be exposed. As the saying goes, the common man is innocent; his crime is possessing a treasure. If someone steals it, all my hard work will have been for nothing.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Ninth celestial layer (九宵):** In Chinese mythology, the heavens are often described as having nine layers or regions. This implies the light reached the highest point of the sky.",

Everyone is welcome to collect and vote more.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nChaqi walked to Huatian and took the cold blade to Nianbing, \"I'm not grateful. But, did you give us a scabbard?\"\n\n\n\nHua Tianyan looked at Baoren unwillingly, turned back to the house, and in a while, he took out a scattered knife cover and threw it to Nianbing. \"This knife set is made of cold iron. After my special processing, it is in harmony with the cold knife. The blade is sheathed and will not touch the sheath, but it can also cover the chill of the knife itself. I am really big this time.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing put the cold knife into the sheath. Sure enough, the blue light was as bright as possible, and the cold air was still unknown. Only the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess at the hilt was still emitting a faint blue light. Looking at the knife in his hand, Nian Bing respectfully bowed to Hua Tianshen, \"Thank you for the front sash knife. The front sash is embedded with a stone. It is different from before. Please give it a name.\"\n\n\n\nHuatian's eyes showed a hazy light, \"The autumn water is white dew, and the cold sky is over the ground, just call it the morning dew sword.\"\n\n\n\nCha said with great praise: \"Chenlu, what a good name.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing held the morning dew tightly and shouted in her heart, \"Mom, you have put my Snow Goddess Stone Cauldron on this knife, will you blame me?\" I still remember that when you left, your unwilling voice was filled with unwillingness. This knife used the Stone of the Snow Goddess as its soul, so it was called the Snow Goddess' breath. The breath of the ice and snow goddess - the morning dew sword. This is how a worldly magic blade appeared. \n\n\n\nHuatian looked at Chajin and said, \"I'm tired, you go. I'm afraid the sword has just passed by the warriors. Be careful when I go back. The kitchen knife is so sarcastic! It's actually a kitchen knife. Mom.\" After venting the discomfort in his heart, Huatian walked towards his small dark room with staggering steps.\n\n\n\nChazi pulled Nian Bing's little hand and said, \"Little Breaking Dao said, let's go quickly and don't be noticed. It's such a cheap guy.\" As he got along, he tore off a long slat from under his clothes and laid it on the hilt of the knife, covered the light of the Stone of the Snow Goddess, inserted the knife into Nian Bing's, and pulled him away in a hurry.\n\n\n\nMost of the people in Ice and Snow City have fallen asleep, and the streets are a little deserted. As they walked, Nian Bing asked Chou in a low voice: \"Master, is that Hua Tianqian just the one who practices martial arts?\"\n\n\n\nChaqi smiled slightly and said, \"It can be said yes or not. Although he cultivated his fighting spirit, he did not have any martial arts skills. With his nine-way fighting spirit, he should have passed the great swordsman among the warriors, and may even enter the realm of a martial artist. However, he does not know how to use martial arts skills. His nine-way fighting spirit is completely for the sake of making a living. You have also seen that as the best product of the igneous fighting spirit, what else is more suitable for making weapons than that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Master, can't you cook with your temper?Fighting can also have various attributes! \"Nian Bing asked for a puzzled heart.\n\n\n\nThe investigation was extremely snatched and said, \"No, the fight is too domineering, and what we say is explosive, and magic can do whatever we want. Don't say too much, leave quickly and go back to the hotel before saying that we will go back to the Peach Blossom Forest tomorrow morning. Before you go back, don't let the morning dew knife leave the sheath. Once you are masturbated, we can't protect this treasure.\"\n\n\n\nWhen they returned to the hotel, it was almost late at night. They had been walking for a day and were already tired. After sending Nianbing back to the room, they went to the next door to rest.\n\n\n\nAlthough Nian Bing was tired, he was so young that he was sleepy for a moment. He took out the morning dew knife from the middle and played with it repeatedly. If it weren't for the extreme ding, he would have drawn the knife and left the sheath and looked at the blue light again. The sound of Hu Yi next door was assured, and it was obvious that he had already fallen asleep. Nian Bing stuck out her tongue and murmured, \"Luckily, I have to ask for two rooms, otherwise, I won't have to sleep tonight. The power of Hu Yi's Hu Yi is really great!\"\n\n\n\nWith a breath of embracing the snow goddess of ice and snow, Ignoring Bing slowly closed her eyes and began a daily compulsory course - meditation. In just one's time, he had already entered the state of meditation. Under the guidance of mental power, the fire element and the ice element gathered towards Nian Bing's body. Today, I was actually a little tired. In addition to the excitement of the morning dew sword, he forgot that the two magic powers of ice and fire were already in an unbalanced state at this time and did not have much control. People with magic elements naturally condensed into their bodies.\n\n\n\nThe Stone of the Ice and Snow God and the Stone of the Fire God were always accelerating the degree to which Nian Bing condensed magic elements. Without long time, the magic power he consumed during the day had completely recovered. However, at this moment, the two magic elements of Ice and Fire were in a subtle state. For more than a year, Nian Bing constantly cultivated his body with the help of the two extreme gems every day, which made his magic power have already accumulated to a certain level, and the amount of storage will inevitably cause quality changes. If he is an ordinary magician, if he continues to practice, his own magic can break through the bottle and reach a higher level. However, Nian Bing is different. He has two magic powers that are completely in line with each other. Although he has reached the bottle at this time, he has undergone special changes. After the two elements of ice and fire filled their half body, in order to gain a larger space, they began the process of mutual destruction. The ice magic attacked from left to right, and the fire magic attacked from right to left, and the two magical powers gradually became wild. During the mutual attack, Nian Bing's body changed significantly. With the center of the body as the dividing line, the left half of the body completely turned into blue, while the right half turned into red. For a while, the two colors of red and blue lights kept waving, and the battle became more and more intense. From extreme cold to extreme heat, the strong stimulation makes the originally entered into meditation clear from entering meditation.With a clear mind, Nian Bing immediately realized something wrong with him. At this time, both the ice magic power and the fire magic power reached an unprecedented violent state. The two magic powers pierced each other, and no one could let them, the Stone of the Stone of the Stone of the Ice and Snow God and the Stone of the Fire God both radiated a faint light, injecting the magic power he had contained into Nian Bing's body, as if they wanted to help the magic power of the same origin to suppress the other side.\n\n\n\nThe alternation of ice and fire, and the stinging sensation made Nian Bing's whole body blew continuously, but at this time the situation had already come out of his control. Even if he wanted to exhale in pain, his mouth could not do it. He could only look at his body with his eyes silence, and constantly changing in the mutual attacks of magic power. As the two magical powers became more and more violent, Nian Bing's left half had covered a layer of frost, while the right half had burned into the fire, and the clothes on her body had already smelled of burnt.\n\n\n\nUnder the impact of these extremely cold and extremely hot magic, Nian Bing's consciousness became a little blurred. He remembered his father, his mother, and everything he had lived in the Ice God Tower.\n\n\n\n\"Mom, Dad, am I going to die? Am I going to die? No, Bing Er doesn't want to die! Dad, have you ever said that the ice and fire are not completely in line with each other? Why is it so difficult for me? You are fire, mother is ice, you can combine them, why can't my magic power be. Dad, mother, you teach Bing Er, what should I do now?\"\n\n\n\n  The human body quality, depending on the circumstances at birth and the inheritance of parents, also has different attributes. Whatever your attributes are, it is suitable for cultivating magic or fighting spirit. If a person with fire wants to cultivate ice-type magic or ice-type fighting spirit, it is almost impossible. Even if he practices cultivating, it will not have any good results, and it will be difficult to achieve a small success in his life. The reason why Nian Bing can possess two magical powers at the same time is that it is also stimulated by his father and mother to the Stone of the Ice Goddess and the Stone of the Fire God when he was in the Ice God Tower, but it is also inseparable from his own attributes. Generally speaking, if the couple has different attributes, the child will only inherit the attributes of one of them.\n\n\n\nBut Nian Bing's parents have strong attributes, which can be said to be two extremes. Therefore, when Nian Bing was born, they had two attributes at the same time. People with such dual attributes are one of them. If their attributes are not incompatible, they practice magic and become a double magician, they will definitely be famous. However, Nian Bing's dual nature is a mutually compatible. Bing and Fire are enemies. Nian Bing has been practicing two kinds of magic in the past year while being incapable of being guided by no one. Because he has always maintained a balance and his magic power is not strong, he has not been able to make trouble. However, after a year of cultivation, with the help of the two extremely fine treasure stones, his magic power has reached the bottle state, and finally this phenomenon of ice and fire attacks is now due to the imbalance of magic power during the day.",

Please vote for it and add it to your collections.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnnouncement: This Sunday at 12:05 AM, the featured post selection event will be moved here. Everyone is welcome to join in the book review section at that time.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIce and fire raged within his body. An ordinary person would have already died from their meridians shattering inch by inch. Even though Nian Bing himself possessed both extreme attributes, he had still fallen into a perilous state. If anything went wrong, he would either be consumed by fire or extinguished by ice.\n\nThe red and blue lights continued to flash alternately, and the spasms racking Nian Bing's body grew more and more violent. The intense pain wracked his meridians, and blood had begun to seep from his pores.\n\nThe Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess and the Stone of the Fire God seemed to have gone berserk along with the state of Nian Bing's body. Ice and fire elements surged into him at a rate several times faster than normal. The violence of the two magical powers intensified, and just as Nian Bing's life was about to be snuffed out by their mutual assault, a warm, verdant light suddenly spread from his chest, merging with both the ice and fire magical powers. By this point, Nian Bing's body was no longer half-blue and half-red; in their struggle for dominance, the two powers had long since coursed through his entire body, entering a mixed state. Under the influence of that gentle, verdant energy, Nian Bing cried out. The ice and fire elements within him, spurred by that verdant energy, began to slowly rotate. Although they were still attacking each other, it was no longer with their previous ferocity. Seizing the opportunity, Nian Bing hastily directed his spiritual power, attempting to control the two opposing magical forces. To his astonishment, however, he discovered that all the magical elements in his body had begun a process of fusing into the vortex mixed with the verdant light. The fusion was slow, but it was unstoppable.\n\nThe verdant light appeared for only an instant before vanishing. After his magical powers entered this bizarre state, the pain from the cold and heat disappeared. The rotating energies of ice and fire reached a wondrous state of fusion. In their slow rotation, the ice and fire seemed completely separate, yet also seemed completely merged, and the struggle between them grew weaker and weaker. The red and blue vortex spun slowly. It was beautiful to behold, a ring of blue and a ring of red. The magical power condensed as it rotated, and the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess and the Stone of the Fire God continued to channel magical elements at several times their usual rate. The magical power that had originally been scattered throughout his limbs and bones was gradually gathered into the vortex. The vortex was not large, and as the two magical powers converged, the blue and red lights gradually became crystalline.\n\n...\n\nRong Tian smiled and stroked his son's head. \"Ice can extinguish fire, but when fire reaches a certain level, it can also extinguish ice. They counter each other. Among the four common magical elements, only water and fire share the most intimate relationship. It's the same for ice; they are both full of vitality. A magic-user of a past generation once said that when fire and water reach a delicate balance, they can be converted into one another. Nothing in this world is absolute. As long as the magnitude of the elemental force remains unchanged, fire and water elements are separated by a razor's edge. This theory once had a great impact on the world of magic, with few supporters and many opponents. I was originally in the opposition, but after I got together with your mother, I discovered that this theory of water and fire merging might not be impossible. It's just that, as a fire mage, I know too little about ice. It's impossible for me to convert fire into ice. Ai, if your mother hadn't been captured and taken back, maybe if we had had more time to research together, we could have truly figured out the secret of Ice and Fire of the Same Origin.\"\n\nA young Nian Bing asked curiously, \"Dad, what is it like when water and fire merge? And how did you discover it?\"\n\nRong Tian coughed awkwardly twice to hide the blush on his face and said perfunctorily, \"You're still young. I'll tell you when you're older.\"\n\n...\n\nWater and fire are the two most intimately related magical elements. Could it be that my current situation is what Dad called the fusion of water and fire? Ice and water share the same origin, so could it be that ice and fire can share the same origin as well? The massive change within his body left Nian Bing feeling very unsettled, but he vaguely understood that he had to maintain this state, to let the ice and fire magical elements continue their current pattern of circulation. Only then would he avoid being destroyed by their mutual attacks.\n\nFor the first time in a year, Nian Bing's body returned to a normal human temperature, no longer half-cold and half-hot. The warm and peaceful feeling allowed him to re-enter a state of meditation, relaxing his consciousness in comfort. His suffering had finally paid off. He did not know that from this moment on, he had become the first mage on the entire continent to achieve Ice and Fire of the Same Origin. Although he had only entered the initial stages, the uniqueness of the magic he would cast in the future would be far beyond what any ordinary mage could compare to.\n\nIn the early morning, as the first ray of sunlight shone into the room through the window, Nian Bing awoke from his meditative state. The two once clearly distinct magical powers within his body had vanished. In their place was a vortex, a fist-sized swirl of red and blue. The two different magical powers shone in concert, rotating slowly, neither encroaching upon the other. The crystalline blue and crystalline red were dazzling to behold. Nian Bing could clearly feel that his perception of magical elements seemed to be much stronger than before. He touched the jade pendant hanging from his chest and murmured, \"Aunty, thank you. If this Tianhua Pendant hadn't stabilized my magical powers in time, I'm afraid... Nian Bing will one day repay your kindness.\" In the moment of crisis, the verdant light had come from the Tianhua Pendant. *The sun warms the jade of Blue Field, causing it to emit a gentle mist.* This pendant, carved from mutton-fat white jade, was far more potent than he had imagined. A glint flashed in his eyes. He raised the hand holding the Morning Dew Blade and softly chanted, \"Oh, element of Ice! I beseech you, gather into a sharp blade, and sunder the world's shackles and chains.\"\n\nA blue light shone from the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess. Visible ice elements took form, and a solid blue ice blade appeared before him. The vortex in his body continued to spin, and the use of the Ice Blade spell didn't affect it at all; he couldn't even feel a decrease in his ice magical power. The vortex remained in its balanced state of rotation.\n\nNian Bing's heart pounded. He subconsciously took out the Stone of the Fire God from his robes and chanted again, \"Oh, element of Fire! I beseech you, gather into a sharp blade, and sunder the world's shackles and chains.\"\n\nThe light of fire replaced the blue ice blade. With a flash of light, a solidified flame blade appeared before him. It was the same right hand, with no distinction between ice and fire. Nian Bing's heart trembled. The ingenious combination of ice and fire had given him the true ability to use two opposing types of magic. With a flash, spurred by his spiritual power, the ice blade and the flame blade collided in mid-air. With a *hiss*, steam rose, and the two second-tier spells vanished simultaneously. \"I did it! This is great! I can finally use both types of magic!\" Nian Bing leaped excitedly from the bed. Ice and Fire of the Same Origin had granted him a special ability.\n\nA knock came at the door. Zha Ji's voice came from outside. \"What are you hollering about so early in the morning? Open the door.\"\n\nNian Bing quickly put away the Stone of the Fire God and went to open the door. The moment Zha Ji saw him, he immediately clutched his nose. \"Whoa, it stinks to high heaven! Kid, did you take a shit in your room or something?\"\n\nNian Bing paused for a moment, then looked down at himself. Only then did he realize that his body had, at some point, become sticky, and his clothes were plastered to him by a paste-like substance, which felt extremely uncomfortable.\n\nZha Ji looked Nian Bing up and down, a flicker of surprise in his heart. It had only been one night, but Nian Bing seemed to have grown a little taller. The biggest change was in his eyes; his once-childish gaze had become much more profound. He felt more like an adult, especially with the lustrous sheen deep in his eyes, which gave off a unique feeling.\n\n\"Nian Bing, what happened last night?\" Zha Ji asked in surprise.\n\nNian Bing scratched his head and said, \"Master, it seems my magic has had a breakthrough, reaching another realm. I don't know why I sweated so much.\" Of course, he didn't know that this was because the violent clash between ice and fire had forced all the impurities from his body, putting him through a process of complete metamorphosis. That was why his body had undergone these changes.",

Go and wash it quickly. We are going back to the Peach Blossom Forest. I don’t want this kind of clothes, and I don’t think I can’t wash it out.”\n\n\n\nNian Bing replied and turned back to the sanitary room in the room and went to wash. Looking at his chubby figure, he showed a thoughtful expression and said, \"It's all right.\"\n\n\n\nPushing the wooden car, Nian Bing followed Chauan and the two walked out of the city. The weather was very clear today, and the blue sky was cloudless. The cool air in the morning was blowing constantly, which was particularly comfortable.\n\n\n\nSeeing that he had reached the north city gate, the sound of horse hooves suddenly rose from outside the city gate. The soldiers of the Ice Moon Empire guarding the city were arranged in a row on both sides, and some of them brought the people who were preparing to enter and leave the city on the street to the side.\n\n\n\nThree horses drove into the city quickly. The horses were all white, and each side was surrounded by silver wires. There was a delicate ice flower in the middle of the hexagram. Seeing this tag, the civilians in the Snow City couldn't help but feel respectful, and some even respectfully went to the horse. Of course, this does not include Chapin and Nianbing. \n\n\n\nNian Bing was so familiar with the symbol of Binghua. His fists were already tightened, and a strong light of hatred appeared in his eyes. They were them, they were the ones who had left their happiness!\n\n\n\nThe horse drove quickly, and cried and said, \"We're leaving.\" Nian Bing's expression relaxed. He secretly told himself that his current abilities were still much worse. To be patient, you must be patient.\n\n\n\nAlthough the journey from Ice and Snow City to Peach Blossom Forest is not far away, they did not return to the wooden house until noon. After handling the things I bought back, I checked it and let Nian Bing go back to the room to rest. Tomorrow, I will continue to learn his art. Nian Bing just entered the state of the same origin of ice and fire, and was about to meditate more to strengthen his magic power. After eating the delicious lunch made by Chau, he went back to the room to rest.\n\n\n\nTime passed day by day, and Nian Bing grew up gradually in the teaching of Cha Ou. The day after returning from Ice and Snow City, he understood why, at the first time, he told him that if you want to learn good cooking skills, you must have to go through a process from thin to fat, and then from fat to thin. From thin to fat, he naturally tastes the dishes he cooks every day and distinguishes the taste. With the large amount of nutrition supplements, he naturally becomes a fat man.The process from fat to thin is much more painful. The method of checking is very simple, and he asked Nian Bing to be responsible for daily work. He only pointed out some of the things he made himself, and the rest was for Nian Bing to explore. In this year, Nian Bing lost weight and turned back to the beautiful boy he was. I'm afraid everyone can think of what the taste of a dish made by a novice. After tasting the delicious food, what he makes is actually rare and it is impossible not to lose weight.\n\n\n\nTwo years have laid a solid foundation for Nianbing. From the third year, he entered the process of formal learning of cooking arts, and the requirements for him were very strict. His daily practice would always make Nianbing exhausted. Meditation at night is his best rest, which not only helps his body recover from fatigue, but also makes his mental power progress no less than magic power during the learning of art and meditation. The longer you learn, the more you think of the magic of ice, the more you will be, and check the various cooking methods in your chest, as deep as the sea. Nian Bing seemed to have forgotten the hatred and devoted himself to the learning of the arts. Under the guidance of the Investigation, his understanding gradually emerged, and he often put forward some novel insights and Investigation to explore each other. By the fifth year, Nian Bing no longer completely learned from the Encyclopedia, but in the negotiation, he gradually combined magic and art. This not only improved his Encyclopedia, but also was the best way to cultivate magic control. Various delicacies from magic into the kitchen appear again and again in Nian Bing's hands, and the skills of the ghost chef are attached to the inheritance. \n\n\n\n\"Teacher, what do you want to eat at noon today? Your physical condition is not very good recently. I will give you two fish to make soup. The Mingyan Fish Soup I developed a few days ago will definitely make your appetite.\" After Nian Bing completed today's compulsory course to chop firewood, he came to the check-in room for inquiries.\n\n\n\nCha Chi sat in the recliner in the room, and the navy on her face was much deeper than a few years ago. \"Nianbing, come in and sit down, the teacher said to you.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment, strode into the room, pulled a chair and sat next to the checker, \"Master, what's wrong with you today? My hatchet has already made great efforts to chop the catfish. Don't you want to see it? You should eat, your stomach is not good, if you don't eat at the right time, you will suffer from old stomach problems again.\"\n\n\n\nCha Jin looked at Nian Bing's concerned gaze and smiled and said, \"Eight years, you have been here with me for eight years. In eight years, you have grown from a child to a handsome boy, and the teacher has not taught you much. With your current skills, you have reached the level of being better than the blue. Silly boy, in fact, the teacher has been cheating you and chopping you with a hatchet. As long as you reach the level of being as strong as a slim, you will be successful. You don’t have to reach the level of being virtual and not falling, and being long and constantly. Your knife skills are far from the level of being a master at that time. I never expected that I was just a theoretical idea, and you actually did it. No such thing as magical skills. I have nothing to teach you, so you should leave too.\"The eighteen-year-old apprentice looked unusually handsome. Although he was wearing a cloth dress, he could not hide his English. His tall figure, wide shoulders, and golden length. He was almost perfect.\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at the search, \"Master, do you say I can teach?\" When he started to learn how to learn how to check the skills, he never thought that he could learn how to check the skills as soon as possible. However, people have feelings. After eight years of mutual intercourse, although the investigation is extremely strict with him, he has already developed a strong relationship with the investigation. At this time, when he heard the investigation, he would leave, a sense of inexplicable loss arose in his heart. Looking at the teacher who was more than eight years ago, he said, \"Mr., you are in such a big year. If I leave, who will come to take care of you?\"\n\n\n\nChaqi smiled and said, \"Silly boy, wasn't I the same person before you came? Don't worry, I can't even die of a dignified ghost chef. Your art is like I was back then. If you stay here, you won't have any improvement. Only by walking and watching more can you have a deeper understanding and I will teach you a lot.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's eyes flashed, \"Master, I can't let you go!\"\n\n\n\nChazi pulled up Cultivator Nian Bing's big hand and said lightly, \"I'm crazy, can you stay here forever with me? Even if you are with me, I will die one day. At the beginning, I accepted you as a disciple completely out of selfishness, just to pass on your own skills. Not only did you not blame me, but you also devoted yourself to learning about cooking art with me. It's hard for you for these years.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's whole body was shocked, \"Master, do you already know?\"\n\n\n\nChaqi smiled and said, \"When you took out that piece of ice stone, when you saw the strong hatred that appeared when you saw the Ice God Tower's car, I already understood that the hypnosis at that time did not work. Do you know? I was a little scared at that time. At that time, you were just a ten-year-old child, with such a deep The mind is something I never thought of. I really don’t know if Gao Xingxing has a smart and steady apprentice, or is afraid of your mind. However, nothing matters now. I believe that you are a good child, and there must be a story hidden in your heart, about your parents’ stories.\"\n\n\n\n\"Master, I, I will tell you all.\" Nian Bing's voice trembled a little. Looking at the extremely kind face of checking, he suddenly felt an ominous premonition.\n\n\n\nThe investigation was extremely shattered and said, \"No, stay in your heart. I think your parents should have something to do with the Ice God Tower, so you will reveal such heavy hatred when you see the car. Child, there is nothing wrong with hatred, but, as I said when I tried to hypnotize you, when you don't have enough strength, this hatred must be hidden in your heart. It's not too late for a gentleman to take revenge for ten years.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was determined and said, \"Master, I promise you that I will never try to go to the Ice God Tower to avenge you until I don't have enough ability.\"\n\n\n\nChaqi smiled slightly and said, \"That's good.Nian Bing, my teacher once told me that I have been practicing the chef for ten years and learning the chef for ten years. These eight words have been remembered for the rest of my life. When I came to this peach blossom forest, I added eight words to the back, which means being alone for a lifetime and a one-time defeat. \"",

Thank you.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotice: This Sunday at 12:05 AM, the Highlighting Gala will be moved here. Everyone is welcome to join us in the book review section at that time.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Ten years to train as a chef, ten years to comprehend cooking, a lifetime of solitude, and a single defeat brings ruin.\" Nian Bing repeated Zha Ji's words. \"Master, I understand. Rest assured, I will definitely reclaim the title of 'Ghost Chef' for you.\"\n\nZha Ji gently shook his head. \"There's no need. The Ghost Chef is me, not you. You've learned my skills, but you cannot be content with the status quo. Only through constant improvement can you reach the pinnacle of the culinary arts. A chef is a very ordinary profession on the continent, and you need to work hard at cultivating your magic. This profession also happens to be your best cover. I don't hate that woman from back then, and you don't need to go looking for her. The past is in the past. If not for her, perhaps I would never have comprehended the mysteries of combining magic and cooking, nor would I have taken on such a fine disciple as you.\" As he spoke, his wrinkled hand took out a long, cloth-wrapped bundle from his side and handed it to Nian Bing. \"This is my old partner. From now on, I'm entrusting it to you. Take it out and have a look.\"\n\nNian Bing opened the cloth bundle. As the wrapping was unwound bit by bit, a knife appeared before him. Kitchen cleavers generally don't have sheaths, but this one did, just like his Morning Dew. The blade was about the same length as the Morning Dew, but it was much wider—a full four *cun*¹—with an extremely thick spine of half a *cun*. When he held it, its weight was substantial, easily equivalent to three Morning Dew knives. The sheath was vermilion, adorned with antique-looking patterns. Nian Bing gripped the handle, which fit his hand perfectly, and slowly drew the blade.\n\nA faint, scorching aura rushed towards his face from the dark red blade. Nian Bing's hand trembled, and the Flame God's Stone in his chest let out a low roar. The rotational speed of the Ice and Fire Homologous Magic Power in his body clearly quickened due to the stone's agitation. When the entire blade was free of its sheath, the previously incongruous wide-bladed, thick-spined knife actually displayed an extraordinary beauty. A dark red luster flowed over the entire knife. The edge of the blade was sharply defined with distinct angles, like the fins of a shark, with beautiful, streamlined curves running along its entire length. Holding it in his hand, the sensation of a raging inferno made Nian Bing's blood boil with excitement.\n\n\"This is a treasured knife I acquired only after I became famous. It's my old partner, like a brother, always by my side. Remember Hua Tian? This is his proudest work, aside from your Morning Dew. This True Sun wasn't forged from metal. To be precise, it was carved. Its base material is the horn of a fire dragon.\"\n\n\"A fire dragon's horn? Master, do fire dragons really exist?\" Nian Bing asked curiously, looking at the elegant, streamlined patterns on the True Sun Knife.\n\n\"I can't answer that question for you either. I can only say that they exist in legends. Even if they do, they must be extremely rare. I discovered that fire dragon's horn in a valley. Because the horn itself was hot, I knew it had to be a treasure. So, I found Hua Tian and let him take a look. He told me right then and there that he wanted the horn and I could name any price. Your master is pretty shrewd, you know! I told him, 'The horn can be yours, but you have to craft the proudest blade of your life for me to use as my kitchen knife.' Hua Tian agreed, and thus, the True Sun Knife came to be. He was a true friend, indeed; he carved this treasured knife directly from the fire dragon's horn. Because it was carved, there are no seams on the blade. Moreover, it possesses the aura of a fire dragon and is itself of the fire attribute. Back then, if I hadn't been too arrogant and neglected to use the True Sun during my competition with that woman, it would have been impossible for her to beat me, even with magic-infused cooking. The name of the Ghost Chef is not an empty one, after all.\" At this point, Zha Ji coughed several times in a row, but the pride in his eyes didn't diminish in the slightest.\n\n\"Master, you should rest for a bit. Don't talk anymore,\" Nian Bing said with concern as he gently patted Zha Ji's back.\n\nZha Ji smiled faintly. \"I'm fine. I'm just too happy. My disciple is about to graduate, and I finally won't be taking my skills with me to the grave. Nian Bing, what are your plans after you leave here?\"\n\nNian Bing was taken aback. \"Master, I've never thought about that.\"\n\nZha Ji said, \"Then listen to my advice. After you leave, go to Ice Snow City first. I wonder if that old fellow Hua Tian is dead yet. Go pay him a visit on my behalf. As the continent's number one master blacksmith, he has plenty of treasures, far more than what you saw the other day. Who knows, you might even get something good out of it.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes suddenly reddened. He tightly gripped Zha Ji's hand. \"Master, I don't want to go. I really don't want to go.\"\n\nA strange light flickered in Zha Ji's eyes. \"Silly child, didn't I tell you? You can't stay under my wing forever! When it's time to go, you must go. In Ice Snow City, the Grand Achievement House and the Clear Wind Pavilion are both famous restaurants in the Ice Moon Empire. That will be your first stop. You can pick either one and find a way into their kitchens to observe the skills of their chefs. It might be of some benefit to you. But remember, once you reveal your own culinary skills, you must leave. Otherwise, with your current abilities, you'll easily attract attention. If you're discovered by state officials, it could lead to a lot of trouble.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded with tears in his eyes. \"Master, I'll remember. I will follow your example, travel to every corner of the continent, and learn how to prepare all kinds of dishes. I will not disappoint you.\"\n\nZha Ji wiped away Nian Bing's tears and said kindly, \"Silly child, what are you crying for? Just remembering this is enough. To the left of the kitchen stove, the wall is hollow. I have some savings in there. You can take some of it for now, just enough for your travel expenses. Money may not be a good thing, but it's hard to do anything without it. Taking a little extra won't hurt. As for everything else, you'll have to figure it out on your own. Oh, right. I don't think it's enough for you to just cultivate your magical power. If you get the chance, you should find a highly accomplished magic user to give you some guidance. You must learn to be flexible. As long as someone has something to teach you, there's no harm in taking them as your master. Live and learn; that's something every high-level chef must do.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, looking at the faint red glow appearing on Zha Ji's face. The unease in his heart grew stronger.\n\nZha Ji smiled, his expression very calm. \"Child, your aptitude for comprehension is much stronger than your master's. Although it's only been eight years, you've learned much more than I did in my first ten. Eight years to train as a chef, eight years to comprehend cooking... but I don't want you to be lonely for the rest of your life. If you meet a suitable girl in the future, don't let her go. Pursue her with all your heart. Happiness is something you have to fight for yourself.\"\n\nNian Bing was completely clueless when it came to matters of the heart. \"Master, let's talk about that later.\"\n\nZha Ji said sternly, \"No, this is something you must promise me. It's something you have to do. I don't want the tragedy that befell me to be repeated in your life. Having a stable family will only be good for you; it will help steady your heart as you continue to delve deeper into the culinary arts. Oh, right, didn't you say you were going to make me fish gruel? Go on, then. Master is getting a little hungry. These past few years, I've been eating your cooking so much that even my own food has started to taste bland.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded emphatically. \"Master, rest assured. I will make the most delicious Bright Flame Fish Gruel for you to taste.\"\n\nZha Ji smiled faintly and waved a hand at him. \"Go on, go. Master will be waiting for you.\"\n\nNian Bing acknowledged, gathered his emotions, stood up, and ran out quickly. Watching Nian Bing's retreating back, a gratified light shone in Zha Ji's eyes. \"Child, Master was not wrong about you. Although you are quite shrewd, you are still a person of deep and true feeling. With a disciple like you, what more could I have to linger for?\" His hand trembled as he picked up the True Sun Knife. With a soft sigh, he began to hastily scratch something on the ground. Though the characters were crooked, they were still somewhat legible.\n\nNian Bing ran swiftly to the riverbank. To let his master eat the fish gruel sooner, he waded directly into the water to catch the fish. Having lived here for these past few years, he had long since become an excellent swimmer. In no time at all, he had caught two plump grass carp and returned to the bank. Looking at the lively, flopping fish in his hands, he paid no mind to the water soaking his clothes and muttered to himself, \"The fish is so fresh today. Master, I'll definitely make a fish gruel that you'll be satisfied with.\"\n\nSaying this, Nian Bing excitedly ran back to the peach blossom forest. In a few quick bounds, he arrived in front of the wooden cabin. \"Master, Master, look! I caught two big fish! You'll probably be able to get full just from the fish today! Master...?\"\n\nWhen Nian Bing re-entered Zha Ji's room, he suddenly froze, his whole body stiffening as if it had been encased in ice. Zha Ji was still lying there in his comfortable recliner, but his eyes were closed. His peaceful expression made it seem as if he had fallen asleep, but Nian Bing knew with absolute clarity that this was not how his master slept. Besides, there wasn't a single day his master's snores couldn't be heard, but now...\n\n---\n¹*Cun*: A traditional Chinese unit of length, roughly 3.33 cm or 1.3 inches.",

But how can a fish continue to live once it has left the water?\n\n  Nian Bing flew to the recliner, tightly gripping Zha Ji’s hand. His own hands trembled, and so did his heart.\n\n  Zha Ji’s hand was already growing cold, and there was no rise and fall in his chest. Nian Bing brought a trembling finger under Zha Ji’s nose. He hoped, he prayed, but everything was so cruel. All hope turned to dust. Zha Ji was gone, passed away with a contented smile.\n\n  Tears streamed down uncontrollably. In his extreme grief, Nian Bing couldn't even make a sound as he cried, his body wracked with sobs. Scenes from the past flashed through his mind. Zha Ji had saved him, brought him to this Peach Blossom Forest, and taught him everything he knew without reservation. For all these years, he had been like a father, caring for him meticulously. Eight years. Why only a short eight years? Master! Nian Bing was still waiting for you to watch him reach the pinnacle of the culinary arts! How could you just leave like this? Don’t you want to see Nian Bing become a top-tier chef? Master, why did you have to die? Why?\n\n  Nian Bing’s heart was bleeding. Aside from his time at the Ice God Tower, this was the most sorrowful moment of his life. He lowered his head, his tears splashing onto the ground. He saw the Zhengyang Knife. A faint warmth flowed along its blade—it was his master's favorite. On the ground, a few lines of small, crooked characters appeared: \"Nian Bing, I’m afraid Master can’t wait for the fish soup you're making. In truth, my heart died the day my tendons were severed. For a chef, being unable to personally cook dishes you have clearly mastered is a fate more painful than death. The only reason I clung to life was so that my skills wouldn't die with me. Nian Bing, Master was selfish. For that, I apologize. Master is gone, but Master's skills remain. I believe you will surely pass on all you have learned, bring glory to the art of cooking, and become the greatest chef. Master didn't want to go so soon either, but my body could no longer hold on. Every time, I told myself I had to persevere, to hold on until the day you could surpass me. The heavens have not been unkind to me; they let me hold on until this day. Nian Bing, do you know how excited my heart was when I saw your culinary skills far surpass my own? It was more exciting than if I could cook with my own hands again. Don't be sad; there is no point. Pour all of your emotions into your training in cooking and magic. Lastly, Master must urge you: revenge is necessary, but you must act within your capabilities. Be cautious. Be cautious. I am going now. When you return and see this, take what you must and do not move my body. I like this recliner. Burn this place down. To be reduced to ashes by your fire magic… Master can die content.\"¹ The last few words were very blurry. If Nian Bing weren't so familiar with Zha Ji's handwriting, it would have been difficult to make them out. The final character, *suo*, was only half-written.\n\n  “Master, are you really gone just like that?” Nian Bing’s tears had already soaked the front of Zha Ji’s robe. He carefully straightened Zha Ji’s hair, stood up, took a few steps back, and dropped to his knees with a thud. He kowtowed heavily to Zha Ji nine times. “Master, I know you wouldn't want to see a weak Nian Bing. Rest assured, I will be strong. From the moment I left the Ice God Tower, I told myself I must be strong, that tears should only flow from the eyes of my enemies. But today, I still cried. Master, rest assured. As long as Nian Bing has a breath left in him, I will fulfill your last wish and bring glory to the path of culinary arts. This is my promise to you.”\n\n  Standing up, he sheathed the Zhengyang Knife and resolutely wiped the tears from his face. He took one last, deep look at Zha Ji’s face and then strode out of the room.\n\n  The wind was gentle, the clouds were light. Sunlight cast dappled, dancing shadows on the ground of the Peach Blossom Forest. A soft breeze carried the scent of peach blossoms. Nian Bing took a deep breath, suppressing the grief in his heart. As Zha Ji had instructed, he took some purple gold coins from a hollow space in the kitchen wall, packed a simple bundle, and slung it over his back.\n\n  One step, two steps, he walked forward. When Nian Bing reached the seventeenth step, he suddenly turned back. “Master! Your disciple is leaving. When I have achieved mastery, I will surely return to pay my respects to your spirit. Fire! Burn! O scorching flames, in my name, I command you, surging inferno, follow my guidance and turn all to ash! Sea of Fire!” The Zhengyang Knife left its sheath, and a red light suddenly blazed. Visible red points of light converged on Nian Bing's body, and the scorching aura made him look like a god of war wreathed in flame. He pointed the Zhengyang Knife forward, and the surging flames erupted, instantly swallowing the two wooden huts beside the kitchen.\n\n  Watching the raging inferno before him, Nian Bing could almost see his master's face and hear his laughter again. His vision blurred, but he forced himself not to let the tears fall, vowing silently in his heart that from this day forward, he would become even stronger. Only the strong could live longer, could better fulfill his own wishes and his master's.\n\n  Sea of Fire, a fourth-tier, large-area fire spell. Although it was also a fourth-tier spell, its wide coverage required a high-level mage to use. The scorching flames quickly turned the wooden hut where Nian Bing had lived for eight years into ashes. And with it, his master, the Ghost Chef Zha Ji, fell to the yellow earth.\n\n  Everything had vanished. With tears in his eyes, Nian Bing set out on the journey Zha Ji had arranged for him. He did not know what awaited him, but he knew with certainty that no hardship or obstacle could stop his advance.\n\n  The Peach Blossom Forest returned to its tranquility, green smoke curling from the ruins of the wooden hut. An hour after Nian Bing left, the ashes suddenly stirred. After the sound of a few pieces of broken wood shifting, a wooden plank flipped over with a creak. A stumbling figure seemed to crawl out from underground, covered head to toe in dust.\n\n  “You brat, you’re really ruthless! If I hadn't been quick, I’d really be ashes now.” The person who had suddenly crawled from the ruins was none other than the previously “dead” Zha Ji.\n\n  Dusting himself off, he looked full of vigor, not at all like someone who had been sick. Looking in the direction Nian Bing had left, Zha Ji smiled. “Silly boy, Master had to trick you one more time. If I didn't make you think I was dead, how could you wholeheartedly pursue the pinnacle of culinary arts? Dammit, this Turtle's Breath technique is a real pain. Good thing I've practiced it for a long time and can hold my breath long enough. Ai, he burned it so cleanly, looks like I have no choice but to leave. Should I go find her? I'll go. Since I have no more attachments, I'll do what I've always wanted to do in my heart. As long as I can see her one more time, I can die content. Nian Bing, take care. Perhaps one day, we, master and disciple, will meet again. Haha, hahahaha.”\n\n  Nian Bing walked along the main road, his heart still immersed in the grief of Zha Ji’s death, completely unaware that he had been tricked by his master yet again. The Zhengyang Knife and Morning Dew Knife were in his tunic, the hot and cold currents constantly stimulating his body. Because the ice magic within him was constantly circulating, he felt no heat at all despite the blazing sun.\n\n  *Ice Snow City. Master told me to go to Ice Snow City. I'll head there first.*\n\n  Without a cart to push, without having to match Zha Ji's pace, Nian Bing walked quickly. He suddenly had a strong desire to leave this place, to leave this place of sorrow. But at the same time, he knew he would return one day. And when he did, it would be as Rong Nian Bing, filled with burning hatred.\n\n  “O great ice elements! Lend me your fury, and carry us to the lost shore! —Blizzard.” The road was empty. Nian Bing chanted a large-area ice spell. The surrounding air instantly grew cold. Under the effect of his blue magical power, channeled through the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess, a massive magical effect burst forth. Wind and snow came together, turning the area covered by the spell into an ocean of ice and snow. With a faint smile, Nian Bing's body moved, moving with incredible speed. The Morning Dew Knife had appeared in his hand at some point, and a faint blue light enveloped his body. Moving with the blizzard, he floated up, not flying high, but at an astonishing speed. In the blink of an eye, he had vanished at the end of the road.\n***\n¹The original phrase is 死得其所 (*sǐ dé qí suǒ*), an idiom meaning to die a worthy death or die in a way that is fitting. Zha Ji only managed to write half of the final character, 所 (*suǒ*).",

    "content": "Notice: This Sunday night at 12:05, the Featured Review Session¹ will be moved over here. Everyone is welcome to join us in the book review section at that time.\n\n---\n\n…\n\nIce God Tower.\n\n“Is that the aura of the Ice and Snow Goddess’s Stone again? After so many years, it has finally appeared once more. This time, I will not let you escape from my grasp. No matter who holds the Ice and Snow Goddess’s Stone, they have already offended the dignity of the Ice and Snow Goddess. There can be only one result, and that is death.”\n\nThe great Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess and Oracle, Bingxue Shennü, quietly left the Ice God Tower, embarking alone on the journey to find the Ice and Snow Goddess’s Stone.\n\n…\n\nBy using Blizzard once, Nian Bing had greatly shortened his travel time. By the time his feet were back on solid ground, his sorrowful heart had been somewhat soothed by the cold magic. In the distance, the tall, icy walls of Ice and Snow City were already in sight. Although in recent years he had to come here annually to purchase supplies, aside from the first time he came and paid a visit to the Divine Smith Hua Tian, he and Zha Ji only ever moved about near the North City Gate, returning to the Peach Blossom Forest immediately after buying what they needed.\n\nThis time was different; he no longer had a path to return to. Nian Bing took a deep breath and, with determination, walked toward Ice and Snow City step by step.\n\nEntering the city was as easy as before. Soon he was inside. The scenery on both sides was unchanged; only a few shops had changed owners. Master had said to find Senior Hua Tian first. In that case, I’ll go there first. I've newly acquired the True Sun Blade. It’s fire-aspected, so perhaps my Flame God’s Stone can be inlaid upon it. If so, I will possess two peerless divine blades, and I'll be able to display my skills even better when I cook in the future.\n\nAs he thought, Nian Bing headed in the direction of the Water and Fire Smithy, relying on his memory from that first time. After all, the last time he came, he had been navigating the streets and alleys in the dark. So now, as he tried to find it, Nian Bing was truly stumped. He searched for a full morning but couldn't find the exact location.\n\nSuddenly, an idea struck him. He remembered seeing a very large weapon shop last time, its name seemed to be something like Precious Armaments Pavilion. As long as I find that place, I should be able to find the Water and Fire Smithy. The Water and Fire Smithy might not be recognized by anyone, but someone would surely know of that large weapon shop, the Precious Armaments Pavilion. Thinking of this, he immediately took action. Just as he expected, after asking a few people, he finally found the correct direction. When he arrived at the Precious Armaments Pavilion he had seen before, the memory of the location in his mind immediately became clear. He quickened his pace, and after a few twists and turns, he soon found his destination.\n\nThe door was still just as dilapidated; compared to seven years ago, it hadn't changed one bit. The sign was still there, too, only it seemed to have gathered a bit more dust. Nian Bing recalled what Hua Tian had looked like back then and couldn't help but smile faintly. He stepped forward, knocked on the door a few times, and called out in a clear voice, “Senior Hua Tian, are you in?”\n\nThere was no sound from within. Nian Bing waited a moment before calling out again. Just as he was thinking no one was home, the dilapidated door suddenly opened. A pretty face peeked out from behind it. “Are… are you looking for my master?”\n\nNian Bing could swear that this was the most beautiful voice he had ever heard in his life. It was a girl who looked to be about his age. Because she was leaning out, her long, pink hair cascaded down. Her pair of large blue eyes revealed three parts surprise and seven parts shyness. She looked at him, seeming a little afraid.\n\n---\n\nThis chapter is indeed a bit short on word count, but for the sake of keeping the volumes organized, let's leave it like this for now. This is the last chapter of the first book. This book had a prologue at the beginning, which affected the word count of the final chapter. This kind of situation won't happen in the future. I hope everyone understands. Thank you.\n\n---\n¹TN: 加精大會 (jiā jīng dà huì) is an event where the author selects high-quality posts in the review section to be featured or \"pinned.\"",

    "content": "After all his years of practicing magic, Nian Bing’s spiritual power had grown to a considerable level. He coughed once to cover his own awkwardness and said, “Hello, miss. I’ve come looking for Senior Hua Tian. Is he here?”\n\nThe young woman sized Nian Bing up and down a few times and asked doubtfully, “Who are you? What do you want with him?”\n\nHearing her question, Nian Bing couldn’t help but think of his own master. He sighed softly. “I have come on my master’s final wish, specifically to pay my respects to Senior Hua Tian.”\n\nStill suspicious, the young woman pressed, “Who is your master?”\n\nNian Bing’s brow furrowed slightly. “A disciple should not speak his master’s name. My master used to have a nickname, the ‘Ghost Chef.’”\n\nUpon hearing the words “Ghost Chef,” the young woman gasped, opened the door wide, and stepped out. Only then could Nian Bing see her clearly. She wore a set of blue clothes, her entire body covered save for her head. The collar was high, protecting her neck, and her graceful figure was perfectly proportioned. A pair of beautiful, large blue eyes stared at him unblinkingly. The blue of her eyes was different from his own; his was the deep blue of the vast sea, while hers was the clear blue of the azure sky, her gaze holding not the slightest trace of impurity. To Nian Bing’s surprise, the young woman was exceptionally tall. Though he himself was quite a bit taller than the average person, he was only half a head taller than she was. Her long, slender legs, veiled by her trousers, possessed a breathtaking sort of beauty.\n\nThe young woman noticed Nian Bing sizing her up, and the blush on her pretty face deepened. She asked tentatively, “Are… are you Senior Zha’s disciple? You mentioned a final wish just now. Could it be… could it be that Senior Zha has already…”\n\nNian Bing’s expression darkened as he nodded. “My master just passed away. Miss, is Senior Hua Tian in?”\n\nThe young woman looked at Nian Bing with confusion. “The Senior Hua Tian you’re talking about is my master. But… I heard my master say that Senior Zha had only one disciple, and he was a fat kid. You’re not fat at all! Besides, my master said Senior Zha was in excellent health. How could he have died so suddenly?”\n\nSeeing the young woman’s earnest expression, the sorrow Nian Bing felt from Zha Ji’s death actually lessened a bit. He couldn’t help but chuckle. “A person’s fortune can change from dawn to dusk; who can say for sure how long they’ll live?¹ Why, do you think I’m a liar? The last time Senior Hua Tian saw me, I was only eleven. That was seven years ago. Being fat back then doesn’t mean I have to be fat when I grow up. I am indeed the fat kid you speak of.”\n\nA cold glint flashed in the young woman’s eyes. She insisted, “Unless you can produce something to prove your identity, I will not let you see my master.”\n\nNian Bing said with a sigh of resignation, “As I recall, the last time I came, Senior Hua Tian hadn’t taken a disciple yet. Since you require proof, then have a look at this.” As he spoke, he reached into his robes and took out the Morning Dew Saber, the very one Hua Tian had crafted for him.\n\nThe moment the young woman saw the Morning Dew Saber, her eyes shone. She took the blade from him and gently caressed its seemingly rusted scabbard, feeling the waves of cold energy emanating from within. She murmured, “That’s right, that’s right, this is it, this is it! The Morning Dew Saber.” Her hand moved to the hilt, touching the diamond-shaped gemstone that radiated an icy chill. She was now partially convinced.\n\nWatching the treasured blade in her hands, Nian Bing said, “I call it the Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess.”\n\nThe young woman was stunned for a moment. “What a beautiful name, though it sounds a bit melancholy. Why do you call it that?”\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. “That, I cannot tell you. Let’s just call it my own little secret. Now, beautiful lady, can you take me to see Senior Hua Tian?”\n\nThe young woman nodded, clutching the Morning Dew Saber tightly as she turned to go inside. “Follow me.”\n\nNian Bing followed the young woman into the courtyard of the Water-Fire Blacksmith Shop. It was just as empty as he remembered. The furnace stood in the center of the yard, and beside it lay various other items that appeared to be fuel.\n\nThe young woman led Nian Bing toward the rooms in the back. Since it was daytime, Nian Bing could more clearly see the dilapidated state of the two single-story buildings; they looked as if they might collapse at any moment. The young woman stopped abruptly at the doorway, turned her head to Nian Bing, and said, “Please, go in.” With that, she pushed the door open and made a gesture for him to enter.\n\nNian Bing looked into the young woman’s clear blue eyes and, for reasons he couldn’t explain, a strong sense of trust rose within him. Without a shred of doubt, he strode into the room.\n\n“Ah!” Nian Bing cried out, stopping dead in his tracks the moment he entered. The room had only one window, through which daylight brought a sliver of brightness to the gloomy space. What Nian Bing saw, displayed on a counter, was a plaque. It was clearly a memorial tablet, and on it was written: “Spiritual Tablet of my Revered Master, Hua Tian.”\n\nHe spun around, his gaze locking onto the young woman. “Senior Hua Tian is dead?”\n\nThe young woman’s eyes welled with tears. “Yes. Master left me two years ago.”\n\nNian Bing closed his eyes for a moment, the sorrow in his heart stirred anew. Turning back to face Hua Tian’s tablet, he walked forward, his hands hanging at his sides, and bowed respectfully three times. “Senior, I never imagined that our parting that day would be our last. May your spirit in the heavens find peace. My master has also gone to the heavens. Perhaps, when you see him, you can still have him prepare some of his delicacies for you.”\n\nThe young woman had been watching Nian Bing from behind. Seeing him treat Hua Tian with such respect, her opinion of him improved considerably. She walked to his side and said, “Though my master is gone, his spirit remains. He will live forever in my heart. The debt for his five years of teaching is one I dare not forget. It’s a shame… he didn’t even give me the chance to serve him for a little longer.”\n\nNian Bing sighed deeply. “Everyone must die eventually. No one can control their own lifespan. It was so for Senior Hua Tian, and for my master as well. I wonder when my own turn will come.”\n\nThe young woman looked at the depth in Nian Bing’s eyes, a depth that didn’t match his age. A faint red light flashed in her blue irises. “I still don’t know your name.”\n\nNian Bing was jolted from his thoughts. “Ah! Forgive my rudeness. My name is Nian Bing. And you, miss?”\n\nThe young woman murmured the name to herself. “Nian Bing, Nian Bing… that name has a profound ring to it. I am Feng Nü.”\n\nNian Bing praised, “Like a colorful phoenix among mortals; your name suits you perfectly. I truly never expected this… Seven years ago, when I first came here, my master and Senior Hua Tian were still joking with each other. Now, everything has changed. They are gone, and only you and I are left. It is somewhat improper for a man and woman to be alone in a room together. Since Senior Hua Tian has passed, I shall take my leave. Miss Feng Nü, perhaps we will meet again if fate wills it.”\n\nFeng Nü watched as Nian Bing took the Morning Dew Saber from her hands and started to walk out. She suddenly called, “Wait a moment.”\n\nNian Bing turned back. “Is there something else, Miss Feng Nü?”\n\nA faint blush appeared on her cheeks, though it wasn’t easily noticed in the dim light of the room. “I… I just wanted to ask, did you come looking for my master about something specific?”\n\nNian Bing thought to himself that since Feng Nü was Hua Tian’s disciple, perhaps she could help him. With this in mind, he took the True Sun Saber from his robes and handed it to her. “You’ve probably heard Senior Hua Tian speak of this blade as well. This was once his proudest creation.”\n\nFeng Nü didn’t even need to look. The moment her hand touched the hilt, her eyes lit up, shining even more brightly than when she had held the Morning Dew Saber. “True Sun… is this the True Sun Saber?”\n\nNian Bing nodded. “It is. Before he died, my master passed his most beloved companion on to me. I have carried it with me ever since. I came to find Senior Hua Tian not only to pay my respects, but also for the sake of this blade. Though the True Sun Saber is excellent, there is still a gap between it and the Morning Dew Saber, and that gap exists because it lacks a true soul of its own. The Fire Dragon Horn is a rare treasure, but it does not contain the soul of a fire dragon. Therefore, I want to imbue this True Sun Saber with a soul. If I can do that, it will surely become a treasured blade in no way inferior to the Morning Dew.”\n\nFeng Nü stared at Nian Bing, her gaze intense. “Are you saying that you possess a fire-element gemstone on par with that ice stone?”\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, reached into his robes, and pulled out the Stone of the Flame God. The flame-shaped gemstone emitted a faint red glow, and the moment it appeared, even the air in the room seemed to grow restless.\n\n---\n¹ An adaptation of the Chinese idiom 人有旦夕禍福 (rén yǒu dàn xī huò fú), literally \"a person has morning and evening misfortunes and blessings,\" meaning that one's fortune is unpredictable and can change at any time.",

    "content": "The bird girl was shocked and held the Fire God Stone from Nian Bing's hand. Her body was shaking slightly. Suddenly, a group of fire lights suddenly rose from her body. The originally pink red color turned into a sharp red color in an instant. The blue eyes also showed a faint red light. The scorching flames came over, forcing Nian Bing to lift the morning dew knife in her hand, and her thumb was slid, allowing Chen Dew to slightly unsheathed, and the blue light flowed out. A faint chill was hidden in front of Nian Bing, so that he would not be injured by the scorching air.\n\n\n\nAs the red light gradually subsided, the girl returned to normal again, and the complex light flashed through her eyes. \"What a flint. If you embedded it on the positive knife, it will definitely improve the quality of the knife. Although the teacher is gone, if you believe me, I am willing to try to insert it on the positive knife.\"\n\n\n\nLooking at the clear eyes of the girl, Nian Bingxin jumped inexplicably and replied in a hint of relief. However, he immediately calmed down because the previous firelight made him feel clearly that the beautiful girl in front of him was not as simple as she seemed on the surface. The silence hesitated for a moment and said, \"Miss Feng, I want to know how Huatianqian died. Can you tell me?\" The Fire God Stone was left to him by his father, so he must not have any problems because he was confused by beauty for a while. At the beginning, it was precisely for this treasure that my father and his family had to be careful.\n\n\n\nThe girl looked at Nian Bing deeply, \"I am seventeen years old this year and was born in the Langmu Empire. My parents are just civilians. That year, a plague occurred in my family and their lives were gone. Since then, I have been able to live on the streets. Five years ago, I came to Ice City while begging and met a teacher. The teacher said that I was born with a natural fire body, so she took me under the door and taught me what he learned. Five years ago, the teacher felt that his body could not be maintained, but he was unwilling to surrender to his fate. , so, the sect started to practice the sect. When the sect was completed, he threw himself into the sect and injected his soul into the sect, creating an immortal god. However, his own sect bones were gone, and even the ashes were left behind. He did not die because his soul had been completely integrated into the sect. This sect was led by the sect's Nine Heavenly Fire and the sect's soul as the soul, so I named this sect the sect's material. You should hear and check it out before, and it was the same as the sect's sword, which was the original sect's horn.\" \n\n\n\nAs soon as he said, the Feng Nu sent both the Fire God Stone and the Zhengyang Knife to Nian Bing, and walked into it. Nian Bing's heart was slightly moved. When Feng Nu described Hua Tian's sarcasm in her body, the heavy sadness in her eyes could not be pretended, and she couldn't help but believe her identity.\n\n\n\nIn the middle of the day, the girl walked out from inside, holding a long sword in both hands. The sheath was similar to the yang knife, and it was also red. It was carved with a lifelike five-clawed fire dragon. A white bead was wrapped in the mouth of the fire dragon, and a soft light made the whole sheath look unusual, with a silky handle, and a piece of jade, white jade embedded on the tail.This kind of jade Nianbing is so familiar with it. It is the same white jade as his Chinese brand that day!\n\n\n\nThe girl looked at Nian Bing and said, \"This is the sword left by the teacher. The sword is three feet and seven inches long, one and a half inches wide, with a blade two feet and eight inches long, and a handle nine inches.\" A sound of light, the sound of dragon-like roaring cleared the entire room. The sword was out of the sheath, and the red light spread out, and the burning breath dissipated. The woman's wrist was light and brought out a fire-red light curtain when she left the sword.\n\n\n\n\"What a sword.\" Nian Bing couldn't speak, and looked at the red sword blade inside the breath, he clearly felt that this was a sword with a quality that was never under the morning dew.\n\n\n\nThe girl smiled slightly and looked at the blade, her eyes filled with emotion. \"Yes, it is a good sword. Although it is not embedded with the best stone, unlike your morning dew that can be used as a magic wand, it has the soul of the teacher. As a long sword used by a warrior, it is definitely the best among the best. I think we shouldn't have to doubt each other anymore.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's face turned slightly and said, \"Miss Feng, I'm not trying to doubt you, but this piece of flame stone is the only thing my father left to me, so I have to be cautious!\"\n\n\n\nA soft light appeared in the girl's eyes, \"I didn't blame you, but now I have explained it to you. As a craftsman, what else can you be happier than creating an ultimate sword by hand? Please allow me to help you make the yang knife perfect? Carving takes a long time. During this time, you can take my leave of heaven, and after the carving is finished, you will bring the leave of heaven and the flame stone. I think you still need your help when you are really embedded.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing slammed his head and said, \"No, no need, 后后后, can I call you this directly? Let the yang knife be left for you, and I don't have to take it away from the Tianjian. My teacher and Hua Tianqian are good friends, and I hope we can become friends too. I believe you.\" As he said, he turned the yang knife and turned the hilt towards the yang girl.\n\n\n\nThe girl was slightly stunned, turned her wrist and left the Tianjian to sheath, and took the positive knife. When she held the thick hilt, her white jade-like fine fingers accidentally touched Nian Bing. The two of them were shocked at the same time. They had not touched them with strangeness, and they couldn't help but have a tide on their faces. The girl lowered her head and looked at the yang knife, \"Why did you believe me so soon?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Because I believe in my own straightforwardness.\" Is it really straightforwardness? Maybe some of them are, but not all. Nian Bing made a decision quickly because he figured out one thing. Just when the girl pulled out the Leaving Sword, the strong atmosphere on her body seemed to be less than that of Huatian at the time. With this strong atmosphere, it would be very easy to be in such a small space in the room. The magician is competing with the warrior at the distance. Although he can instantly have some low-level magic, it is absolutely impossible to avoid it.Since they have not done this, they have already proved that many things and trust comes from this. \n\n\n\nThe girl laughed, as if she was very happy because of Nian Bing’s trust in her, “Thank you. We are already friends, aren’t it? It takes at least one month to carve. After a month, you come here with a flame stone, hoping that a new divine sword will appear in my hands. If you have something to leave, I will be waiting for you here after carving it. I will not leave for at least one or two years.”\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"I will stay in the Ice and Snow City for a while, so I'll see you in a month. I'll leave first.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl looked at Nian Bing and suddenly said, \"Let's go after eating. I think you must have not eaten yet.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment, and a strange feeling rose in his heart. He clicked a little and said, \"I haven't eaten yet.\" Chase's \"death\" made him feel sad. Although he controlled his emotions well, he had no mood to eat all day. At this time, he heard the girl ask, and then he felt that his stomach was empty and he was indeed a little tired. \"Then I'll make a toddler for the girl, I'm just thanking the girl first.\"\n\n\n\nThe young girl's clear eyes lit up, \"Yes! Why did I forget that you are a fellow ghost chef, and the food you make must be delicious. It seems that I have a good taste this time. You have just called my name directly? No need to add the word \"girl.\" There was still a bit of the previous calm atmosphere in her croaker, like a little girl.\n\n\n\nWhen Nian Bing and the girl from the water truck came to the kitchen where the water truck was cooked, he only smiled bitterly. So he said that the tricky lady was hard to cook without rice. No matter how good the chef was, it would be a waste of money without materials. There is a small kitchen of four or five square meters. Not to mention fresh vegetables and meat, the only ingredients are salt. There seems to be nothing to eat except rice.",

    "content": "\"Feng Nü, what do you eat every day? How is it you only have rice?\" Nian Bing asked, puzzled.\n\nFeng Nü lowered her head, saying a little sheepishly, \"I eat congee every day! It was the same when Master was here. Master said congee is the easiest to digest. Sometimes, we'd also buy some vegetables, shred them, and cook them in the congee. Master said that was nutritious enough. I finished the vegetables yesterday. I can go buy some now. What do you need?\"\n\n\"Just congee?\" Nian Bing stared at Feng Nü, dumbfounded. He gave a wry smile. \"You two really live a frugal life. No need to go shopping. Let's go outside first.\"\n\nThe two of them walked back into the courtyard. Feng Nü looked at Nian Bing and said apologetically, \"I was going to ask you to stay for a meal, but I forgot I don't have any vegetables. I'm sorry.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and shook his head, a strange feeling of pity rising in his heart. \"It's fine, I have a solution. If I can't even handle something like this, I wouldn't be worthy of being a disciple of the Ghost Chef.\" As he spoke, his gaze swept around and then up toward the sky. Soon, he found his target on top of the wall. A blue light flashed in his eyes. He pointed a finger at the wall, and two streaks of blue light shot out and vanished in an instant. The two pigeons that had been playing on the wall were pierced by the light and fell to the ground inside the courtyard.\n\nFeng Nü stared at Nian Bing in shock. \"You know martial arts? Why did you kill those two pigeons? The poor things!\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"I don't know any martial arts. That was just a low-level ice magic spell, Ice Arrow. It couldn't kill a person, but it's more than enough for a pigeon. Feng Nü, you have to understand, in the eyes of a chef, anything edible is an ingredient. Since you didn't have any here, I had no choice but to procure some myself.\"\n\nFeng Nü looked at Nian Bing, displeased. \"I never thought you were such a cruel person.\"\n\nNian Bing gave a slight smile. \"Am I cruel? Well then, you just don't have to eat any later.\" With that, he walked to the corner of the wall and picked up the two pigeons. After eight years of cultivation, his spiritual power had reached a very high level; the ice arrows he had just fired had shattered the pigeons' heads instantly, not causing them to suffer much.\n\nWalking past Feng Nü with the two pigeons, he saw her somewhat dazed expression and smiled. \"Pigeon is very nutritious; it has the effect of strengthening the body and benefiting the kidneys. Since you think I'm cruel, you probably shouldn't watch me prepare them.\" With that, he headed straight for the kitchen.\n\n\"No, I want to watch,\" Feng Nü said, glaring at him defiantly before following him into the kitchen.\n\nNian Bing grabbed a basin, filled it with some water, and went back into the courtyard. With extremely quick movements, he plucked the pigeons clean, removed their entrails, and washed the meat.\n\nWatching the bloody scene before her, Feng Nü frowned again and again but forced herself to stay and continue watching. Nian Bing smiled slightly. With a flip of his wrist, he drew the Morning Dew Blade from his robes. Under the command of his spiritual power, his magic easily froze the bloody water and entrails in the basin into a solid block. He turned the basin over and tapped it lightly, and the block of ice fell out. Holding the two clean pigeons in one hand, he began to chant softly, \"Flames of scorching heat, unleash your inner passion, erupt between heaven and earth—Explosion Flame!\" A condensed fireball appeared before him. A sharp glint flashed in his eyes, and the five-inch-wide ball of fire shot out with a roar. With a *bang*, the entire block of bloody ice completely vanished, leaving no trace behind save for a faint wisp of steam.\n\nFeng Nü stared at Nian Bing in a daze. \"You... you can use two types of magic? Ice and fire... how is that possible?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Nothing in this world is truly impossible. If you dare to dream and dare to act, fantasy can become reality. When I was learning to cook from my master, I often used this method to dispose of the rubbish. See? Not a single trace left on the ground. Ice and fire turn to steam. When I froze the bloody water, I completely fused the pigeon entrails with the ice, so under the impact of the Explosion Flame, they naturally vaporized.\" Explosion Flame was a third-tier spell that required the power of an intermediate mage to cast and possessed immense explosive force.\n\nCarrying the pigeons back into the kitchen, Nian Bing grabbed one by the leg and held it up. Feng Nü's good impression of him had soured considerably due to his cruelty towards the pigeons. She leaned against the kitchen door, watching to see what he would do next. She was surprised to find that, with the pigeon in his left hand, Nian Bing's entire demeanor seemed to change. He stood there, as steady as a boulder, his sharp gaze fixed entirely on the pigeon, as if he were observing something. Suddenly, he moved. All Feng Nü saw was a cyan light that seemed to drift out, shimmering with a dazzling brilliance. Nian Bing's right hand was now like a phantom, constantly twisting and flashing. Strip after strip of nearly identical meat threads piled up on the cutting board below. Though she couldn't see the blade's shadow, Feng Nü was shocked to find that amid the flashing cyan light, the pigeon in Nian Bing's hand was gradually being reduced to a skeleton. In what seemed like only a few blinks of an eye, Nian Bing had already switched to the other pigeon, the cyan light still shimmering. When two skeletons lay on the cutting board, a pile of uniform meat threads sat beside them. Nian Bing took out a white handkerchief from his robes, wrapped it around the blade, and slowly wiped it down. Frosty mist swirled over the Morning Dew Blade, leaving not a single trace behind.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and walked over to the stove. With a point of his left finger, a ball of fire struck the kindling, and flames burst to life. The pot on the stove was reasonably clean. He tossed both pigeon skeletons directly into the pot and poured in water from the side, stopping as soon as it covered the bones. He put the lid on the pot and smiled. \"The original broth for the original food, only then can the nutrients be fully absorbed.\"\n\nFeng Nü stared, dumbfounded. \"Are you sure you haven't studied martial arts? Your knife is so fast,\" she murmured. She knew very well that even though she cultivated Dou Qi, her wrist was nowhere near as fast as Nian Bing's.\n\nNian Bing laughed. \"My knife skills are only for cutting vegetables and meat, and it's just a simple blade. Not like you, who cultivates Senior Hua Tian's Nine Departures Dou Qi. It's a pity; I want to focus on my magic training, or I might have asked you for some pointers on Dou Qi. Since you only have salt here, I won't make stewed pigeon. I'll just make you a simple pigeon meat rice instead.\" As he spoke, he took out a small, square cloth pouch from his waist and spread it open on the cutting board. Inside were many small pockets, each holding an item of different size and thickness. The largest was a small knife, and the smallest was a long needle. There were more than ten items in total, most of them needle-shaped.\n\nFeng Nü asked curiously, \"What are all these for? You look like a traveling doctor. Don't tell me you know acupuncture too?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Needles aren't just for acupuncture; they're also quite good for cooking.\" As he spoke, he took a basin from the side, scooped some rice into it, and gave it a simple rinse with water before placing it beside him. He picked up a single grain of rice with his left hand and with his right, selected the second-thinnest needle from the cloth pouch. The moment the needle was in his hand, its tip turned red, radiating faint wisps of heat. With a flick of his wrist, the needle, heated by fire magic, pierced the raw grain of rice. At the same time, with a flick of his left pinky finger, he threaded a strand of meat through the eye at the end of the needle. Like a piece of thread, it was pulled through to the other side of the grain. The single grain of rice had been perfectly threaded with meat. Immediately after, Nian Bing's movements began to accelerate. Grain after grain was pierced by the needle, ingeniously strung together on that single thread of meat. The miraculous display made the astonishment in Feng Nü's eyes grow and grow. This wasn't cooking; it was clearly the creation of a perfect work of art.\n\nThe complex process continued to unfold in Nian Bing's hands. His hands moved in and out like phantoms, without a hint of hesitation or a single mistake. However, even at his speed, it still took nearly half a shichen¹ to thread all the meat through the rice. Looking at the rows of threaded rice, Nian Bing smiled. This technique of threading meat through rice was something he had accomplished by combining it with magic. Without the scorching hot needle, it would have been impossible to pierce every grain so uniformly. The rice, now like beaded curtains, lay flat on the cutting board. Nian Bing turned around and opened the pot lid. The broth, simmered from the pigeon bones, released a light, fragrant aroma amidst the billowing steam. He took a spoon from the side and carefully lifted the two pigeon skeletons out of the pot. He looked at the milky-white broth and hesitated for a moment before turning back. Murmuring a few words, a faint blue light enveloped the rice on the cutting board, freezing the meat-threaded grains into a single block. The Morning Dew Blade appeared, and with a light flick, he lifted the frozen block of rice and slid it directly into the pot. He evenly sprinkled a thin layer of salt over the block of ice, replaced the lid, and sheathed the Morning Dew Blade. Turning to the long-stunned Feng Nü, he said, \"Alright, it just needs to cook for about another half a shichen, then we can eat. Pigeon meat rice tastes good, but unfortunately, it's quite time-consuming. You'll have to wait a little longer.\"\n\nFeng Nü looked at Nian Bing with a strange expression. \"Are you... are you really cooking? If an ordinary chef tried to make this, I'm afraid it would take them all day.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled. \"A day? If it took a day, the pigeon meat threads would have gone bad long ago. It's meaningless if it only looks good. Wait until you've tasted it before you pass judgment.\"\n\nThe two of them left the kitchen. Feng Nü's earlier displeasure had long since vanished in the face of Nian Bing's god-like culinary skills. She brought out two wooden stools, and they sat down in the courtyard. Nian Bing seemed a bit tired. He squinted his eyes slightly, looking at the tall, ancient tree outside the courtyard wall. Threading meat through rice required complete mental concentration; doing so much at once was like controlling a major magic spell. Even he himself couldn't say why he had gone through the trouble of making such a tedious dish for Feng Nü. Though it sounded simple, it was precisely this kind of simple cooking that best showcased a chef's skill.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.

Thank you.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFeng Nü watched Nian Bing from the side. She hadn’t paid much attention before, but now she realized that this tall, golden-haired youth was incredibly handsome. Although his coarse linen clothes concealed his natural brilliance, the inherent noble air he exuded was something clothing could not hide. Her heart seemed to skip a beat. Feng Nü knew she would never forget the focused expression Nian Bing wore while he was cooking earlier. She asked softly, \"Nian Bing, where are you planning to go after we eat?\"\n\nNian Bing didn’t look at Feng Nü, his mind gradually unwinding in the quiet. \"I'll be staying in Ice Snow City for a while. My master said there are two restaurants here with chefs of considerable skill. I want to go have a look; I might be able to learn something.\"\n\nFeng Nü realized what he meant. \"You're talking about the Great Achievement Pavilion and the Clear Wind Abode, right? A meal there is scarily expensive. I've only heard of them; I've never been inside. But I'm sure they could never make that magical pigeon rice you made. How long do you plan to stay here, and where will you go afterward?\"\n\nHearing Feng Nü’s detailed questions, Nian Bing turned to look at her. Feng Nü's pretty face flushed slightly, and she quickly added, \"I didn't mean anything by it. Since we're friends, I just want to know where I might find you in the future.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"I'll be in Ice Snow City at least until you finish forging the Zhengyang Saber. As for the future, I suppose I'll travel to every corner of the continent. Eight years of practicing cooking, eight years of comprehending cooking. The practice is over; now I need the process of comprehension. I don't even know if eight years will be enough to travel the entire continent.\"\n\nA thought seemed to strike Feng Nü. \"Actually, fame isn't necessarily a good thing. Take my master, for example. Back then, the Divine Smith Hua Tian—what a renowned name! The generals of every nation took pride in owning a weapon forged by him. But what was the result? Every empire wanted to confine him to their country, to have him forge weapons for them. If it weren't for his fame, my master wouldn't have ended up spending his final years in a place like this. Before he forged the Litian Sword, he told me that no matter the profession, if you want to pursue the pinnacle, you must have powerful strength as your backing. Otherwise, it's impossible to do as you please.\"\n\n\"Powerful strength as your backing?\" Nian Bing's heart stirred. He nodded in deep agreement. \"Senior Hua Tian is right. With powerful strength as a foundation, you can better pursue the things you desire. No wonder your Dou Qi feels so strong. It seems Senior Hua Tian must have invested a great deal of effort in you.\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled faintly. \"Your magic isn't bad either! Ice and fire elements, both. I really don't know how you train. Don't the two types of magic conflict?\"\n\nNian Bing had no desire to discuss this topic. He stood up and said, \"Perhaps they do, but I only use low-level magic, so the impact isn't significant.\" The shared origin of ice and fire was one of his greatest secrets; he naturally couldn't let others know about it easily, even if he had already developed a certain fondness for the girl before him.\n\nThe two continued to chat about everything under the sun, mostly revolving around amusing anecdotes from their time studying with their respective masters. By the time Nian Bing remembered that the pigeon rice was ready, both of them felt the conversation had ended too soon.\n\n\"Wow, this is amazing! It smells so good!\" The moment Feng Nü took her first bite of the pearl-like pigeon rice, her beautiful eyes filled with ravenous desire. Nian Bing wasn't very familiar with women, but when he saw the furious pace at which she was clearing her plate, he couldn't help but stare, dumbfounded.\n\n\"Nian Bing, why aren't you eating? If you don't start soon, I'm going to finish it all. Why is this pigeon rice so delicious? It looked like you only added salt!\" Feng Nü urged Nian Bing while continuing to eat.\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile. \"I'm eating. The pigeon rice is delicious because the pigeon's nutrients are fully integrated with the rice. With the meat inside and the bone broth outside, the two infuse each other, filling the rice with the fragrance of the pigeon. A little salt to enhance the flavor, and naturally, it tastes good.\" As he spoke, he started eating as well. If he didn't, he truly doubted there would be any left for him.\n\nThe entire pot of rice was annihilated by the two of them. By a rough count, Nian Bing had eaten only thirty percent, while the other seventy percent had gone into Feng Nü's stomach. Feng Nü leaned back in her chair, panting slightly, her fragrant lips looking even redder than before. Her pretty face was glistening with a light sweat. \"Nian Bing, that was too delicious. It's the first time I've ever had rice that good. No wonder Senior Zha was once famous throughout the world.\"\n\nNian Bing forced a smile. \"My surprise is no less than yours. Feng Nü, are all girls such big eaters? You should know, I made enough to leave you some for dinner. This was estimated based on my own appetite, and yet we managed to eat it all.\"\n\nFeng Nü's face turned beet red. She shot Nian Bing a glare and said defensively, \"I drink porridge every day! Can't I have a full meal for once? And why didn't you say earlier that my dinner was in there too?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"As long as you enjoyed it, that's what matters. When a chef's creations are eaten completely, it's the greatest encouragement. You're the first person, aside from my master, to eat something I've made. I have to go now. It's getting late, and if I don't get to my destination soon, I'll probably have to sleep at an inn. You ate so much, you should rest for a while.\"\n\n\"Nian Bing,\" Feng Nü called out suddenly. Nian Bing, who had just stood up, looked at her with a questioning gaze.\n\n\"Can you come visit me here often in the future? Master is gone, and I'm really lonely by myself. Most importantly, after eating your food, I'm afraid I won't be able to stand just drinking porridge anymore.\"\n\nSeeing the glint in Feng Nü's eyes, Nian Bing's heart softened. He smiled. \"Don't worry, I'll come see you when I have time. And cook for you.\"\n\nFeng Nü beamed with joy. \"You have to keep your word! I'll be waiting.\"\n\nNian Bing cried internally that he'd been duped. It seemed the power of a beautiful woman was truly formidable; no wonder even his master had fallen for it back in the day. However, since he had already agreed, he had to follow through. It would only be for a month or so anyway. Once the Zhengyang Saber was finished, he would leave this place. In the future, it would be best to keep his distance from women.\n\nFinally leaving the Shui Huo Ironworks, Nian Bing let out a long breath and felt for his belongings in his tunic. Everything was with him, except for the Zhengyang Saber which he had left with Feng Nü. The Great Achievement Pavilion or the Clear Wind Abode—which one should he choose? He'd have a look first. Since his master had said that once he revealed his culinary skills he must leave immediately, he might as well start from the most basic position.\n\nThe Great Achievement Pavilion and the Clear Wind Abode were located in the most prosperous central district of Ice Snow City. The two establishments stood across the street from each other, and had always been each other's greatest rivals.\n\nThe Great Achievement Pavilion was decorated with extreme opulence. Viewed from the wide central avenue of Ice Snow City, it was the most striking building on the left side of the street. It stood four stories high and covered an area of tens of thousands of square meters. The entire structure was dominated by dark red and gold, showcasing its luxury. A red carpet extended from the main hall all the way to the entrance. On either side of the entrance stood a large stone lion, each about three meters tall. Above the five-meter-wide main gate hung a golden plaque with three large characters: Great Achievement Pavilion. A couplet flanked the entrance. The left scroll read: *Golden splendor and jade dew in our fine cuisine*; the right read: *Noble silver and sweet springs in our rare delights*. At the entrance, four beautiful young women in red gowns were stationed on each side to greet guests, leading streams of magnificently dressed patrons inside. This was the favorite haunt of officials and nobles; it seemed only here could they display their status.\n\nAcross from the Great Achievement Pavilion was the quaint and elegant Clear Wind Abode. As its name suggested, while it lacked the grandeur of the Great Achievement Pavilion, it appeared far more refined. The three-story building featured a green-themed decor, with every detail exuding a unique elegance. The three vigorous characters for \"Clear Wind Abode\" on the plaque above the entrance were clearly the work of a master calligrapher. The pillars on either side also bore a couplet. The left scroll read: *Laughing and chatting, great scholars sip fine tea*; the right read: *Coming and going, men of letters sample elegant fare*. This was a place frequented mostly by scholars and literary figures. The reason it could consistently stand against the Great Achievement Pavilion was that it served as the gathering place for the Magician's Association. As one of the noblest professions, magicians held a transcendent status in every country, and the Magician's Association was highly esteemed by the royalty of every empire. Although the Magician's Associations of different empires did not interact with one another, each possessed considerable influence within its own nation.",

Thank you.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNian Bing stood on the Central Street, looking at the Dacheng Car on the left, and then at the Qingfeng on the right. For a while, she couldn't help but feel a little troubled. Where to go? Judging from his own wishes, he prefers the elegant style of Qingfeng, but the connections on the door have been written. Although he is not as white as a monk, he has only learned to write with his father when he was young. Don’t talk about Dongru, even a scholar cannot be considered a scholar. It seems that there is no way to go to Dacheng. Thinking of this, he turned toward Dacheng on the left side of the street.\n\n\n\nEight girls at the entrance of Dacheng's door were receiving guests. When Nian Bing walked up to them, the girls were attracted by his handsome face, and sixteen graceful gazes were cast on him, which made Nian Bing a little unsuitable. One of the girls looked at Nian Bing’s awkward look and couldn’t help but burst into laughter, saying, “The local buns from where are they? It’s so long.”\n\n\n\nAnother girl also spoke, but her words were much more sarcastic, \"Yes! It's so long. There must be many people who love it. Unfortunately, we are not brothels here.\"\n\n\n\nThose who can eat in Dacheng's carriage are all expensive and dressed in a beautiful manner. The leading girls in front of the door have already learned to observe their words and look at them. When they see Nian Bingqing's appearance and his outfit, they know that he is not a valuable person, so they naturally start to make fun of him. \n\n\n\nNian Bing was slightly angry, but he was not angry at this time, which made him angry and said, \"Please ask, if Dacheng Jiao recruits chefs, I can make side dishes.\" The so-called side dishes are to cut the dishes, match the ingredients that must be quilted, and then give them to the big chef, which is cooked into dishes from the big chef.\n\n\n\nThe first girl smiled, \"So she is still a chef! I wonder which school you graduated from?\"\n\n\n\n\"Cooking Art School?\" It was still the first time that Nian Bing heard this lyrics. Are there any chefs now? The listener said that they should be all disciples!\n\n\n\nThe girl looked at him disdainfully and said, \"I don't know anything about the art school. Do you still want to go to the great success? I think you should go quickly. Not everyone can come here.\"\n\n\n\nWhen Nian Bingzheng didn't know what to do, a man walked out of Dacheng's car. He was tall and looked over forty years old. His face was full of flesh, giving people a fierce feeling. He was wearing a purple long robe, holding a fan in his right hand, hitting the palm of his left hand. The fan was very large, and the length was about one foot and five inches. From the way he knocked, it could be seen that the weight of the fan was not small and was definitely not made of wood. As soon as he left, he saw Nian Bing at a glance, walked over a few steps, and asked, \"What's going on?\"\"\n\n\n\nThe eight girls who had originally had a smile immediately stood in their positions when they saw this middle-aged man, and they didn't see the smile on their faces. The girl who had talked to Nian Bing before said, \"Three shopkeepers, this person thinks that we are working here, but he doesn't even know about the art school. I'm letting him go.\"\n\n\n\nThe middle-aged man looked at Nian Bing and said impatiently: \"Raise quickly, don't worry about old man's eyes. You are a ghost like you, you don't deserve to shine my shoes.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's eyes were shining with cold light. He was about to do it, but he heard a crisp sound from behind, \"Oh, the shopkeeper Liao San is starting to be powerful again. I don't know when Liao's skin dogs started wearing shoes.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked back and saw a girl who had arrived at a high-end place at some point. The horse was very tall, just like the war between the riders in the Silver Feather Riders Group, all white and without a single hair. The girl was wearing a red dress. , with a long and beautiful figure, full of heroic eyebrows, and a red sheathed sword hanging around her waist. Although her appearance is not as beautiful as a woman, it gives people a lively beauty. A brown long curl is scattered behind her back, and a red-clothed white horse is always bringing a bright landscape to Central Street.\n\n\n\nWhen the shopkeeper Liao San heard the girl's reprimand, he was furious and stood there and said with hatred, \"Xue Jing, don't think that if your father is holding you back, I dare not do anything to you.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jingyu rushed down from horse's back, walked to Nian Bing and looked at the shopkeeper Liao San, and smiled and said, \"Is that right? Then come! I want to see, what can you do to me? I don't know who fell a dog to eat shit last time. Dacheng, hum, I spit.\" The shopkeeper Liao San was obviously very jealous of the girl Xue Jingyu. Although her face was already radiant, she didn't dare to do anything. As soon as his eyes turned, his anger had an object of ejaculation. The fan in his hand twitched to Nian Bing's shoulder, \"I'm broken, I'm not going to slap the egg.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's heart was already full of hatred. Seeing the voice brought by the shopkeeper Liao San, he knew very well that if he had done it, his shoulder blades would probably be broken. However, he was deeply in his heart and did not do anything at this time. A sound of a stumble, a fall and retreated behind the girl in red. The girl in red flapped her wrist and a red fight came out. With a bang, the shopkeeper Liao San fell a few steps back and fell to the ground. The red-clothed woman Xue Jinghu hummed with disdain and said, \"The skinned dog wants to bite people again. If I don't give you some harm today, I won't call her Xue Jinghu.\"\n\n\n\n\"Miss Snow, let's forget it for my sake.\" A loud voice suddenly erupted, and another person walked out of Dacheng. This person looked over fifty years old, short and fat, wearing a long golden robe with golden flowers on his robe, and his face was filled with fat meat. A pair of small eyes in the fat meat stomping were shiny.\n\n\n\n\"Boss, Xue Jing is here to our door again to do something. You must teach her.\" Manager Liao San asked the short and fat man for help. The short and fat man slapped him with a slap and slapped him in a cold voice, \"Come back, are you still not too tired?\"Liao San's face changed slightly, and he never dared to say anything again. He returned to Dacheng in shame. As soon as he left, the short and fat man smiled a lot on his face, and the fat meat on his face kept trembling in his smile, \"Miss Snow, we are all the time, we are always calm and peaceful, so we should be rich.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing sneered, \"It turns out that the shopkeeper has come out. Okay, you have to give the owner some face to beat the dog. Forget it this time, let Liao San give me some memory, and see you bully others again, hum.\" He turned around and was about to leave, but he happened to see Nian Bing behind him. Looking at the panicked look on his face, Xue Jing said unhappily, \"You have grown such a big son, you are really a waste. Nowadays man!\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing originally had a few favors for Xue Jingyu, but when she heard her domineering language, she felt that she was a little less favor. She just wanted to say something, but she heard Xue Jingyu continued, \"Looking for a job, come with me, we Qingfeng is missing a piece of firewood.\" After speaking, she went over and took her white horse and walked to the side of Qingfeng.\n\n\n\nChipping wood? No, after being chopped for so many years, why did you still have to chop firewood after it comes out? Nian Bing couldn't help but smile bitterly on his face. Although he had already felt bad about chopping firewood, he probably wouldn't be the only way to enter the clear wind without revealing his own cooking art. Helplessly, he walked in from the side of Qingfeng with Xue Jing. \n\n\n\nAs soon as I entered the side, I heard a faint fragrance when I heard a smell of plants. The air seemed to be much fresher. Looking around, except for a small path made of stone characters, there was a green color around it. Among the green color, there was a small lake in front of it. The lake was not big, only three or four hundred square meters. There was a long corridor on it, and four pavilions were located crosswise. There was a unique atmosphere and thick.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, what are you looking at? Let's go quickly.\" Xue Jing said to Nian Bing impatiently. Only then did she see Nian Bing's appearance clearly and said in her heart: She is so handsome, but she has no ability. God gave him such a look in vain, which was really a waste.\n\n\n\nTwo servants in blue clothes walked over. One of them took the snail from Xue Jing's hand and said respectfully, \"Miss, you are back. The Dragon Spirit Magician has been waiting for you for a long time.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sister Linger is here? That's great. I'm just looking for her. Where is she?\" Xue Jing's face showed an exciting light.\n\n\n\nThe lower person said, \"The Dragon Spirit Magician is in the moonlight.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay, I'll go now. Oh, by the way, I rescued this person from the street. Let him go to the woodshed to chop firewood. I remember where there is a shortage of people.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, Miss.\" Xue Jing ran away quickly, passing through the corridor and couldn't see him. One servant walked away with her horse, while another servant said to Nian Bing, \"Come with me.\"",

Thank you.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNian Bing agreed and followed the servant in blue robes along a path between stone buildings, heading deeper into the Pure Wind Fast. The farther in he went, the more he was charmed by the elegant atmosphere. Every detail revealed the owner's unique ingenuity, and the arrangement of pavilions and towers created a sense of simple, refined beauty.\n\nThe servant led Nian Bing out of the front courtyard to a row of buildings on the side. He walked to the door of the innermost room and said respectfully, \"Manager, are you in?\"\n\nA clear voice rang out, \"Come in.\"\n\nThe servant gave Nian Bing a look and pushed the door open, leading him inside. The room was very clean, a suite with an outer and an inner room. He couldn't see the inner room, but the outer one was filled with a scholarly air. Several works of calligraphy and paintings hung on the walls, and a wide, carved wooden desk was covered with various writing implements. Behind the desk sat a man who appeared to be in his thirties, dressed in a long white robe, his head bowed as he wrote. Though Nian Bing could only see his side profile, he was surprised to find that while the man's features were ordinary, he possessed a special kind of temperament—a nobility revealed through his elegance. *The manager? The manager of the Pure Wind Fast?*\n\nThe servant said to the middle-aged man, \"Manager, the Young Miss brought this person in and said to have him help in the woodshed. I've brought him here for you to register.\"\n\nThe man in white looked up at Nian Bing. Their eyes met, and from the man's brilliant gaze, Nian Bing saw wisdom. He thought to himself, *This person will not be easy to deal with.*\n\nThe man in white was also slightly taken aback by Nian Bing's handsome features and tall stature. He asked, \"What is your name? Where are you from? What can you do?\"\n\nNian Bing replied, \"My name is Nian Bing. My ancestral home... my ancestral home is in the Huarong Empire. I studied cooking for a time.\"\n\nThe man in white smiled faintly. \"Have you attended a culinary school, then?\"\n\n*Culinary school again. If I get the chance, I really should see what they teach in these culinary schools,* Nian Bing thought. Shaking his head, he answered truthfully, \"I have not.\"\n\nThe man in white said, \"Xiao Si, take him to get a set of clothes. As the Young Miss said, let him work in the woodshed for now. If he does well, we can consider training him to become a junior chef.\"\n\nXiao Si replied respectfully, \"Yes, Manager. Come with me.\"\n\nAfter changing into the blue shirt and trousers Xiao Si found for him, Nian Bing was led to a separate small courtyard in the back. The yard was stacked with a great deal of wood, some of which was already chopped into neat firewood and piled up. There was a shelter over the woodpile, obviously to protect it from the rain. As soon as Xiao Si entered the yard, he called out, \"Uncle Li! Uncle Li! I've brought you a new person!\"\n\nA resonant voice boomed, \"A new person, is it? Good! These old bones of mine can finally relax a bit.\" The man appeared along with his voice. Also dressed in blue, he was an elder in his fifties with few wrinkles on his face. He was tall, holding an axe, with ordinary features and a smile that made him seem very approachable.\n\nUncle Li's gaze fell on Nian Bing, looking him up and down. \"Mm, you look sturdy enough, but I don't know if you can handle hardship. All the firewood for the Pure Wind Fast comes from here. Kid, if you can't finish your work, you'll have to work overtime.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Hello, Uncle Li. I grew up with hardship, so working is no problem. You don't have to worry.\"\n\nUncle Li laughed. \"That's good. Xiao Si, you can go back. I'll take him from here. Now that we have a new guy, I won't have to find others to help out anymore. The two of us working together should be enough to supply the kitchens. Come, I'll show you to your room first.\"\n\nXiao Si left. Uncle Li led Nian Bing to a building in the corner of the small courtyard. There were three rooms here. Uncle Li said, \"Originally, this wood-chopping job was supposed to be done by three people. But ever since Dacheng Xuan opened and took some of our business, it's just been me holding down the fort. I only find help when I can't keep up. You can stay in the room on the right. The one in the middle is a bit of a mess and hard to clean.\"\n\nEven a woodchopper had his own room; the Pure Wind Fast was certainly doing well. Thinking this, Nian Bing walked into the room on the right, put down his bundle, and came right back out.\n\nUncle Li was waiting for him at the door. \"Kid, ever chopped firewood before?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. When it came to chopping wood, he could be considered a veteran.\n\nUncle Li smiled. \"Don't worry, I won't bully a newcomer. From now on, we'll split the work fifty-fifty. Here at the Pure Wind Fast, we're particular even about chopping wood. The logs are delivered, and when you chop, you have to try to make the pieces as uniform as possible. See? Like those over there.\" As he spoke, he pointed to a nearby woodpile. \"I'll finish today's work. You can watch from the side. Starting tomorrow, you'll have to share the load. Oh, right, what's your name? Who hired you?\"\n\nNian Bing briefly recounted what had happened on the street earlier. After hearing his story, Uncle Li chuckled. \"The Young Miss might have a fiery temper, but she has a very kind heart. Don't worry, even though we're just woodchoppers, the benefits are good. We get room and board, plus an income of one gold coin a month. You could say we're the happiest woodchoppers around. And our time is pretty flexible. As long as we finish chopping the wood needed for the day, we can do whatever we want. You can go out for a stroll through the back gate.\"\n\nAs Nian Bing listened to Uncle Li talk about the Pure Wind Fast, he observed his surroundings. From the old man's descriptions, he gradually formed a general impression of the place. The Pure Wind Fast was no smaller than Dacheng Xuan in area, but because it prioritized various elegant landscapes, it could accommodate far fewer guests. Not far from the woodshed was the kitchen. Every day, someone from the kitchen would come to collect firewood. He would only see the chefs during mealtimes. According to Uncle Li, the food at the Pure Wind Fast was excellent. Even the servants' meals, though prepared by junior chefs, had meat and vegetables and were quite good.\n\n\"Uncle Li, let me do it. You take a rest,\" Nian Bing said, taking the axe from Uncle Li's hands. He grabbed a log, and with a single drop of the axe, the wood split. He deliberately slowed his pace, and with a few more swings, eight neat, identically sized pieces of firewood appeared. Uncle Li praised him, \"You've definitely done this before. Nian Bing, your technique is so practiced, you must have been chopping for quite some time. The Young Miss really found me a good helper this time.\" With Nian Bing's help, he was happy to take it easy and became even more talkative.\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile. \"All told, I suppose I've chopped wood for eight years. Uncle Li, I heard Xiao Si and the others mention to the Young Miss that a Great Magician named Long Ling came looking for her. Are Great Magicians very powerful?\"\n\nUncle Li nodded earnestly. \"Of course they are. Unbelievably powerful. The headquarters of our Bingyue Empire's Magician's Guild was established here in Ice Snow City to make way for the Bingshen Taran. I hear that Miss Long Ling is the daughter of the Guild Master. She reached the level of Great Magician at such a young age. She and our Young Miss are the closest of friends.\"\n\nThe Bingyue Empire's Magician's Guild was headquartered in Ice Snow City. This information was extremely useful to Nian Bing. Although he didn't know what level his magic power had reached, he felt it should be close to that of a Great Magician. What he lacked most right now were magic books for ice-type magic. Incantations were crucial; no matter how high one's magic power, it was useless without the spells to guide it. Although he had managed to guess some low-level ice incantations based on his knowledge of fire magic, spells of the third rank and above each had their own unique characteristics. Possessing all this ice magic power but lacking the incantations was a deeply unpleasant feeling. If he could get into the Magician's Guild and look at their magic books, it would be a huge help to him.\n\nWith Nian Bing's assistance, it didn't take long to finish the day's wood-chopping task. Nian Bing had carefully observed Uncle Li's pace earlier, so when he chopped, he only maintained a similar speed. The firewood he produced was uniform, but he didn't strive for the same perfection he did back in the Peach Blossom Forest. Halfway through, two men dressed in white chef's uniforms had come to take some of the wood away.\n\nUncle Li laughed heartily. \"Having you here really makes a difference. You're such a diligent young man, keeping up with my usual pace. It's getting late; it should be about time for dinner.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Uncle Li, I won't be eating here tonight. I just arrived in Ice Snow City and want to go for a walk and buy some daily necessities.\"\n\nUncle Li was an easygoing man and didn't ask any more questions. He told Nian Bing where the back gate was and let him go.\n\nLeaving the Pure Wind Fast, a light flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. Since he now knew the Bingyue Empire's Magician's Guild headquarters was here, he would go and take a look first—at least to ask what the requirements were to read their materials. With this in mind, he followed the main road, stopped a random person to ask, and quickly found out the location of the Magician's Guild.",

    "content": "The magicians will be in the south city, and the clear wind is in the middle of the ice and snow city. Nian Bing distinguishes the approximate direction and walks in a slight way. At this time, the sky was getting darker and evening was coming.\n\n\n\nBecause he could not use magic, his progress was no different from that of ordinary people. He walked for an hour before he saw a tall building far away. It was a house constructed like a spire, and the height was even a few points higher than the Dacheng Car. The top of the house looked very special. On the side facing the street, there was a huge golden hexagram symbol. No need to ask, this is where you are looking for. Thinking of this, Nian Bing speeds up and walks towards the Magician Association.\n\n\n\nAt this moment, the sound of horse hoof suddenly came from behind. Judging from the sound, the horse was moving forward unhappy, but it was very rhythmic, and the crisp hoof iron sounded like music. When I was a child, Nianbing once heard from his father that only the best horse will have a fixed rhythm when it runs. Looking curiously, she saw a girl riding a red tall horse and heading towards her. The girl was wearing a blue magic robe with no mark on the magic robe. She was combed in her back with a long purple and beautiful appearance. Nian Bing secretly compared her to the robe, and was surprised. The girl who looked a little weak was not inferior to the robe. Her big black eyes were looking towards the direction of the robe, showing a gentle smile.\n\n\n\nMany passers-by seemed to know her and smiled and gave her the way. Although the girl was not happy, she was a few minutes faster than Nian Bing's walk, and then arrived at the Magicians Association before him.\n\n\n\n  When turning over, a man in a yellow magic robe walked out of the workplace, helped her to stop the horse, and said kindly, \"Spirit, you finally came back, why did you go there for so long.\"\n\n\n\nLing Er smiled softly and said, \"Snow Jingyuan left me to eat evening meals. Brother, you also know that Qingfeng food has always been my favorite, so I came back a little late. Are you eating it?\"\n\n\n\nThe man smiled and said, \"I have eaten it. Let's go in.\"\n\n\n\nWhen Nian Bing heard the word \"spiritual\" and felt a little moved in his heart. Could it be that this girl is the great magician Long Lingyan who had made a date with Miss Xue Jing? Judging from her appearance, her temper and temperament are completely different from Xue Jingyun, so their names should be changed. Since he is the daughter of the President of the Magician Association, if you ask her, it should be easier to get the answer. Thinking of this, he quickly stepped forward, and before Long Ling's brother had not yet entered the trade meeting with his elder brother, he said, \"Please ask, is this the Magicians Association?\n\n\n\nLong Ling'er looked at Nian Bing curiously, and looked at his hurrying look and couldn't help but smile.\n\n\n\nThe man glanced at Nian Bing and said proudly, \"No, this is the Magicians Association. What's wrong with you?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"I want to ask what conditions are needed to read magic books in the trade association?\"\n\n\n\nThe man's eyebrows were slightly browsed and said, \"That's necessary for people in this trade fair to read, and you must be of your own level and not read the information in the trade fair at a higher level. Can't you be a magician?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was busy and said, \"Yes, I am an ice magician. I wonder if I can go to the commerce for reading?\" He was already familiar with the first eight levels of fire magic. The eight-level magicians can only be used by a master of magicians. Now what he needs most is the ice magic spell, so he naturally reported the name of the ice magician. \n\n\n\nWhen the man heard Nian Bing, he said that he was an ice-type magician, and his expression on his face was a little calmer, \"Then have you joined a trade fair in other countries? If so, we will not welcome it here. On the contrary, you can go to the trade fair for testing. According to the results of your test, the trade fair will give you the corresponding tag. However, depending on your appearance, even a magician will not be too high.\" Although the man's words were a bit mean, what he said was true. Magicians are a very expensive career, especially in the early stages. If they were not helped by the best treasure stone, it would be difficult to feel the existence of magic elements. The price of treasure stones is always high in any country in Yangon, and it is not something that ordinary people can afford. What's more, it's not easy to achieve something if you practice magic? It's hard to get something if you don't have Master Ming, so it's hard to blame this man for being suspicious.\n\n\n\nNian Bing, no matter what kind of commerce you add or not, as long as you can learn the magic spells you need, it will be enough. He hurriedly said, \"I have not joined any commerce now. Can you please take me in for a test? If possible, I am very willing to join the Magicians Association of Ice Moon Empire.\"\n\n\n\nThe man glanced at Long Ling's beside him, and Long Ling's beside him was also looking at him, \"Brother, just help him. Judging from his appearance, he should have come from another place. Now there are fewer and fewer people in the trade fair, and we also need to absorb more fresh blood. Several old people in the trade fair are there. If he has a good reputation, we might be able to have more strength.\"\n\n\n\nThe man clicked a little and said, \"But it's a bit late today. I think I'll say it tomorrow. Boy, come again tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing thought that he would still stay in Qingfeng tomorrow, and he should also explore the specialty food in Qingfeng, so he didn't have enough time. He couldn't help but say to the man, \"Dear Mr. Magic, can you please make peace with me? I will have some things during the day tomorrow, and now I'm just free.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough the man was Long Ling's junior brother, due to his limited qualifications, he is now a high-level magician in the earth system and has not reached the level of a great magician. When he heard Nian Bing calling himself a great magician, he was in a good mood. He thought to himself that the teacher and sister liked to help others more. If I helped this kid this time, maybe my sister would have a great impression of me. Thinking of this, he showed a faint smile on his face and said, \"Since you are coming from another place, let's break the example. Come with us.\"\n\n\n\nLong Lingye smiled slightly and said, \"Brother, I knew you are the best person.\"\n\n\n\nThe man was so fond of the beloved teacher girl. The man was in a good mood at the time. He smiled slightly at the dragon spirit and walked in the first place. Nian Bing gave a grateful look to the dragon spirit and hurriedly followed the two of them into the magician meeting.\n\n\n\nThe huge building outside the Magician Association is just its surface. Through the door, there is a space like a playground. The top buildings around it are closely connected. The area is so large that even the Dacheng and the clear wind are not as good as the Magician Association of the Ice Moon Empire.\n\n\n\nAfter the man handed the horse of Long Ling's horse to a servant, he walked into a pointed building on the left with Long Ling's horse and walked into a pointed building on the left. As he walked, he asked Nian Bing: \"What's your name? What's the realm of ice magic?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing hurriedly replied, \"My name is Nian Bing. I have always been practicing my own cultivation. I don't know what level I have reached. Have you not asked me yet, great magician, what is your name?\"\n\n\n\nThe man said calmly, \"My name is Shijiu. This is a test site. The Trade Union stipulates that any magician test must be conducted by a magician. You can wait here. I'll see if several seniors have entered meditation. If they have started meditation, they cannot be punished. You can only come tomorrow.\" After speaking, he spoke to Long Ling and turned around and walked into a side.\n\n\n\nLong Lingye smiled slightly and said, \"My brother, although he has a strange temper, he is very kind. If there is any offense in his words, I will ask you to explain it.\" He said, and continued walking in it.\n\n\n\nHearing the soft words of Long Ling's words, I felt very comfortable in Nian Bing. I felt that she was much better than Xue Jing. She smiled and said, \"Great Magician, you don't need to be polite. This time I'm really troubled you. Although I have been practicing magic, I never have to be led at all, so I thought of learning a little in the middle of the trade fair this time. I would like to ask you to give me more advice if I have the chance.\"",

    "content": "Long Ling'er smiled faintly and said, \"I wouldn't dare presume to guide you. And you don't need to call me an Archmage; I haven't even taken the ranking test yet. That's a requirement from my father. He says that none of his disciples are allowed to take the test or wear the insignia before reaching the rank of Archmage, so they don't embarrass him. My father is very powerful. If you pass the test, I can introduce you to him. From now on, you can just call me by my name. I'm Long Ling'er, but everyone calls me Ling'er. Speaking of which, I'm an ice magician, just like you. Why don't you have a magic robe? Without a robe, how can you represent your status as a magician?\"\n\nNian Bing put on a bitter expression and said, \"Ever since I was little, I've wanted to become a magician. But my family was too poor, so I could only find opportunities to learn on my own. I once happened to meet a magician who told me I had an ice-element affinity and taught me the method of meditation. I cultivated according to his method and eventually did gain magic power. But that magician only taught me meditation and no spells, so even now, I can only use a few of the most basic ice magic spells.\"\n\nBy this time, they had passed through two gateways and arrived in a large hall. Because the building had a spire, the hall seemed very tall, with an area of about two hundred square meters. The walls were covered with various murals depicting all sorts of patterns, mostly of robed magicians and magical artifacts. In the very center of the hall's floor was a circle five meters in diameter. Within the circle was a six-pointed star, its six points colored white, blue, red, cyan, yellow, and gold, symbolizing the six most mainstream types of magic.\n\nHearing Nian Bing's story, Long Ling'er's eyes immediately filled with sympathy. She comforted him, saying, \"It's alright. For a magician, cultivating magic power through meditation is the most important thing. Magic power is the foundation of all magic. As long as your magic power is strong enough, once you have the spells, you'll naturally be able to use higher-level magic. As for the robe, you don't need to worry. After you pass the test, we'll naturally provide you with one here. However, you must be at the level of an Intermediate Magician or higher to join our guild. Otherwise, you'll just have to continue training on your own.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, thinking to himself, *I should at least be an Advanced Magician. Even if I don't know any high-level ice spells, I still know one or two fourth-level ones",

    "content": "Snowflakes appeared one after another. Li Ta's expression grew serious. Feeling the surrounding temperature, he took out a small magic staff, only eight inches long, from his bosom. He softly chanted something, and a water-like ripple immediately appeared in front of him. This was not a simple Water Wall Spell, but an advanced form of it, a level five single-target defensive water magic — the Water Mirror Spell. It could not only provide excellent defense but also, to some extent, reflect the opponent's magic.\n\nThe Blizzard finally formed, rapidly spinning around Nian Bing's body. Its speed increased, gradually obscuring his figure. Blue light burst from Nian Bing's eyes. He pointed his right hand forward, and the Blizzard condensed into a small tornado that flew close to the ground, heading towards Archmage Li Ta.\n\nSeeing this, Shi Jiu, who was beside them, said disdainfully, \"Junior sister, didn't I tell you? Can a Blizzard with such a small area even be called a Blizzard?\"\n\nA strange look appeared in Long Ling'er's eyes. \"No, senior brother, you're wrong. Father once said that the Blizzard spell can not only attack a large area and allow ice mages to fly for a short time, but if one's magic power reaches a certain level and they have excellent magic control, then it can completely become a single-target attack spell. Only by using Blizzard for a single-target attack can its true power be unleashed. Father told me that when I can reach that realm, I can continue progressing towards becoming an Archmage.\"\n\nWatching the Blizzard condense to such a concentrated area, Li Ta's expression changed several times. He waved his magic staff again, chanting continuously, and two more Water Mirror Spells appeared in front of him.\n\nJust as Nian Bing's condensed Blizzard was about to reach Li Ta, its forward movement suddenly stopped. While the other three mages present were still in surprise, the Blizzard suddenly shot up into the air. The entire vortex turned horizontally, like a giant whip, striking from top to bottom towards Li Ta's position.\n\nHaving immersed himself in magic for many years, Li Ta remained calm in chaos. He took a step forward, pointed his magic staff upwards, and forcefully lifted the three Water Mirror Spells in front of him above his head, meeting the Blizzard's attack.\n\nThe Blizzard, unleashed by Nian Bing with his Ice and Fire Co-existence magic power, had every snowflake like a sharp blade. Mirrors could reflect light, and even energy, but when facing sharp blades, it was a head-on collision. Piercing friction sounds constantly erupted. The first Water Mirror quickly shattered amidst the Blizzard's rapid rotation, followed by the second. When the Blizzard reached Li Ta's final defense, it showed no sign of weakening. Except for the snowflakes being slightly sparser, its attack power remained undiminished. The hurricane filled the entire hall, forcing Shi Jiu and Long Ling to retreat to the edge of the hall, each releasing their own defensive magic. At this moment, Nian Bing had raised his magic power to its limit.\n\nA bright light burst from Li Ta's eyes, and his body suddenly became distorted. As the last Water Mirror disintegrated in Nian Bing's powerful Blizzard, his body suddenly plunged directly into the Blizzard. Amidst everyone's gasps, blue waves suddenly flashed. Nian Bing's entire body trembled. Pulled by the magical force*, he stumbled back several steps, nearly falling to the ground. The Blizzard, too, quietly vanished within the waves. The entire hall, apart from the extremely low temperature, completely returned to normal.\n\nLi Ta's body appeared not far in front of Nian Bing. He said thoughtfully, \"A four-star spell could actually force me to use a seven-star Water Melting Heaven. Young man, your magic control is almost comparable to mine. It's a pity your magic power has only just reached the Great Magician level.\"\n\nLong Ling, who was beside them, asked in surprise, \"Uncle Li Ta, are you saying he's a Great Magician?\"\n\nLi Ta nodded and said, \"Aside from you, this is the first time I've seen a child with such good talent. It's quite remarkable that his magic power has been cultivated to such a degree at such a young age. His magic power level is similar to yours, but his magic control is much stronger than yours. This shows that his mental power is very strong, already close to that of an Archmage. He can be granted the title of Great Magician. The reason your father hasn't let you take the test yet is because your magic control isn't sufficient. In the future, you must work harder in this area and strive to become a true Great Magician soon. Child, how old are you this year?\" The last sentence was directed at Nian Bing, and his tone had softened considerably.\n\nAlthough Nian Bing had consumed a large amount of ice magic power, his mental power was strong, and he had Ice and Fire Co-existence as a backup, so he didn't feel much discomfort. He respectfully said, \"Respected Archmage, I am eighteen this year.\"\n\nA light flashed in Li Ta's eyes. \"Eighteen years old. So you're one year younger than Ling'er. It seems I can only describe you as a genius. Ling'er also barely entered the Great Magician realm after she turned nineteen, but you are even younger. An eighteen-year-old Great Magician, hahahaha. It seems our Ice Moon Mage Guild is about to have a new rising star. Come back tomorrow; I think the Guild Master will be very happy to meet a talent like you.\"\n\nAlthough Nian Bing very much wanted to read the ice magic spells tonight, he knew he couldn't rush it at this moment. He respectfully bowed to Archmage Li Ta and said, \"Then I'll trouble you.\"\n\nShi Jiu's expression continuously changed, and the light in his eyes flickered. He had never imagined that this boy dressed in simple cloth clothes would possess the strength of a Great Magician, even stronger than Long Ling, who had always been called a genius. The jealousy in his heart made his face turn ashen, rendering him speechless. At this moment, Nian Bing turned to Shi Jiu and Long Ling and said, \"Thank you both for your assistance. I will come again tomorrow.\" After saying this, he smiled at them, gestured, and turned to walk outside. Long Ling watched Nian Bing's retreating figure from behind, and a strange feeling suddenly arose in her heart. From childhood, she had been the princess of the Mage Guild, the center of attention, like the moon surrounded by stars, hailed as a magic genius. She had never thought that a plainly dressed boy could be even stronger than herself in magic cultivation. She didn't feel jealous because of this; instead, she was very curious about Nian Bing, curious about how he had cultivated to such a degree. It was known that Long Ling had practically grown up amidst magic gemstones; her father had officially begun teaching her magic when she was five years old to help her grasp the true essence of magic more quickly. Although she was only nineteen now, she already had fourteen years of magic cultivation, and coupled with her extremely high aptitude, she had achieved her current accomplishments.\n\n\"Ling'er, are you surprised? You must understand the principle that there are always people beyond people, and heavens beyond heavens**.\" Li Ta looked at Long Ling, saying with deep meaning.\n\nLong Ling nodded and said, \"That Blizzard he used just now was truly powerful! I had only heard Father talk about it before, but I never thought that a Blizzard, usually used for short-distance flight, could have such strong attack power. Uncle Li Ta, your magic seems to have improved even further. Just now, I didn't even see you chant a spell before you used a seven-star spell. I wonder when Ling'er will be able to reach that level.\"\n\nLi Ta gave a wry smile. \"Are you making fun of me? Let alone me, even your father couldn't use a seven-star spell without chanting a spell. I was too careless earlier and only used low-level magic for defense. By the time I reacted, it was too late to chant another spell, so I had no choice but to use a seven-star scroll. Ah, that scroll of mine took a lot of time to create, and it was only completed with your father's help. If I were to sell it, it would be worth at least a hundred purple gold coins, and even then, it would be priceless but not for sale***. I'm going to find your father now; I must tell him about this.\"\n\nShi Jiu said with some dissatisfaction, \"Teacher Li Ta, is it that important? Perhaps that boy also used a scroll just now?\"\n\nLi Ta said indifferently, \"If I can't even tell if he used a scroll, then I wouldn't deserve to be called an Archmage. Magic can be activated by scrolls, but magic control cannot be faked. If I gave you a Blizzard scroll, could you control it like he just did? Not only could he condense the Blizzard so densely, but he could also control it to suddenly change direction. Although it was somewhat unrefined, even an ice Archmage wouldn't control it much better. His magic control is stronger than that of any Great Magician on the continent right now. I truly don't know how he trained at such a young age.\" After saying this, he cast a meaningful glance at Shi Jiu and turned to leave.\n\nAfter Li Ta left, Long Ling finally awoke from her previous surprise and murmured, \"Uncle Li Ta hasn't smiled in a long time. He actually smiled during the test just now.\"\n\nShi Jiu said impatiently, \"I think Teacher Li Ta is also a bit... Never mind, let's not bother with him. Junior sister, let's go. How about I accompany you for some late-night snack?\"\n\nLong Ling shook her head and said, \"No, senior brother. Today I realized how far behind I still am in magic cultivation. I have no advantage among my peers. I want to seize the opportunity to cultivate hard and strive to catch up with Nian Bing soon. You should also cultivate more. See you tomorrow. I wonder how Father will react when he meets Nian Bing tomorrow.\" After saying this, she greeted Shi Jiu and floated away.\n\n---\n*   氣機牽引 (qìjī qiānyǐn): The pulling or influencing force between two magical or spiritual energies.\n**  人外有人，天外有天 (rén wài yǒu rén, tiān wài yǒu tiān): An idiom meaning \"there are always more capable people out there, and there is always a higher level to reach.\"\n*** 有價無市 (yǒu jià wú shì): An idiom meaning something is extremely valuable but not available for purchase on the market, implying its rarity or that no one is willing to sell it.",

    "content": "Please cast more votes and add to your collection.\n\n***\n\nShi Jiu gazed adoringly at Long Ling's disappearing back, but secretly pondered a countermeasure in his heart. He was nearly ten years older than Long Ling and had practically watched her grow up. From childhood to adulthood, his heart had long been set on his junior sister. Nian Bing's appearance greatly increased his sense of crisis. Nian Bing's age was similar to Long Ling's, his appearance was much more handsome than his own, and coupled with his impressive magical strength, aside from his background being incomparable to his own, he was almost not inferior in any aspect. His junior sister was so beautiful; if he entered the Guild, it would probably be difficult for him to pursue her. It seemed he had to find a way to deal with it.\n\nLeaving the Magicians' Guild, Nian Bing was in high spirits. He knew that the Archmage's assessment would definitely not be wrong. Unexpectedly, he had inadvertently already reached the level of a Grand Magician. Moreover, he possessed two types of magic simultaneously; if he cast two fourth-tier spells, he would naturally be much stronger than an ordinary Grand Magician. Although excited, he would never become arrogant. Although there was only one level difference between a Grand Magician and an Archmage, this single level was an extremely difficult chasm to cross. Nian Bing remembered very clearly that his father once said he reached the Grand Magician realm at the age of twenty-four, but diligently cultivated until thirty-five, only then entering the Archmage realm with the help of the Stone of Flame God. That was already quite fast; the youngest Archmage on the continent was no more than that. From Grand Magician to Archmage, unless one had extraordinary fortune, it would be difficult to advance to that higher echelon of magicians without decades of arduous cultivation. Grand Magicians and Archmages could also be said to be a chasm among magicians; once crossed, one could enter the ranks of powerful magicians, no longer needing to fear warriors of the same level. The strongest Grand Magician could only cast five-level area-of-effect spells, while the strongest Archmage could cast eight-level spells; from five to eight, that was a qualitative leap.\n\nNian Bing was not in a hurry to return to Pure Breeze Pavilion. He bought a full-length black robe and a child's toy skull mask by the roadside. As he walked, a faint cold glint flickered in his eyes. When he was about to return to Pure Breeze Pavilion, he went to a dark corner and put on the black robe. He reached into his robe and gripped the Stone of Flame God in his right hand. Standing at a street corner, he watched the direction of Pure Breeze Pavilion and Grand Success Pavilion's entrances from afar. This was the best time for customers to frequent restaurants. Customers came and went in an endless stream at Grand Success Pavilion's entrance. Although Pure Breeze Pavilion had relatively fewer customers, it was clear that they were all refined scholars or ordinary magicians.\n\nNian Bing stood there motionless; his patience was excellent, and he could wait. His gaze remained fixed on Grand Success Pavilion's entrance, waiting for the person he needed to wait for. The Ice and Fire Co-source power within him circulated naturally, continuously restoring the ice elements he had previously consumed. His left hand reached into his robe and gripped the hilt of the Morning Dew Blade. If others do not offend me, I will not offend others; but if they offend me, I will surely slay them. At this moment, his heart was filled with killing intent.\n\nFinally, after he had waited for more than half an hour, his target appeared. Manager Liao San, whom Xue Jing called a \"mangy dog,\" walked out from the main entrance. He was still holding his large fan, which seemed to be made of iron. With a flick of his wrist, the fan unfolded, and he lightly patted his chest with it, fanning the night breeze onto his face. The young women responsible for greeting guests at the entrance immediately stood rigid the moment they saw him emerge, not daring to even breathe loudly. Liao San walked up to a young woman, suddenly raised his hand, pinched her tender face, and cursed, \"You damn zombie! Who's going to come in if you greet guests like that? Smile for me, hear me?\"\n\nThe young woman's body trembled slightly, and she hastily said, \"Yes, yes, Manager Liao, I know I was wrong.\"\n\nLiao San chuckled lecherously, \"It's good that you know you're wrong. Then, after work tonight, come to my room. I'll give you a good 'training session.' I'll make sure you know what to do from now on.\"\n\nTerror flickered in the young woman's eyes. \"No! Manager Liao, I, I know I was wrong. Please spare me!\" Her knees went weak, and she nearly collapsed to the ground.\n\nLiao San grabbed her by the collar, furious. \"Damn it, you're looking for death! Serving me is a blessing you've cultivated over several lifetimes. Since you're unwilling, then go die!\" With a swing of his fan, he was about to strike the young woman in front of him. As Liao San's fan swung up, he suddenly felt his hand tighten. \"Damn it, who dares to stop me?\" he cursed, turning around. The person who appeared behind him, gripping his fan, was a middle-aged man. This man had a pale, beardless face and a dignified appearance, but a sinister aura emanated from his eyes. The moment Liao San saw the man's face, he immediately softened, hastily fawning with a smile, \"Second Brother, so it was you! This little girl wouldn't even give me face, I was just about to teach her a lesson.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man snorted, \"I think it's you who needs a lesson. When are you going to change that stinking temper of yours? A rabbit doesn't eat the grass near its burrow. If you want women, go find them at a brothel. If you cause trouble in the Pavilion again, I'll tell Eldest Brother to put you in solitary confinement. Don't you know that the Boss hates people who affect his business the most? Although we three brothers are managers, if we anger the Boss, no one can protect you. Also, Eldest Brother told me to warn you: from now on, you are absolutely forbidden from provoking that girl Xue Jing from Pure Breeze Pavilion. Pure Breeze Pavilion has the Magicians' Guild backing it; even the Boss wouldn't dare to touch them, let alone you. If you anger them one day and they find a high-level magician to kill you, your death will be in vain.\"\n\nLiao San listened to the middle-aged man's reprimand. Although displeased, he dared not say much. \"Second Brother, there isn't much going on in the Pavilion today, so I'll go out for a walk. I'll be careful from now on.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man nodded, saying, \"Go. Don't be too ostentatious as a person. Come back early. I'll speak well of you to Eldest Brother.\"\n\nLiao San chuckled lecherously, the flabby flesh on his face piling up, making him look even uglier than if he were crying. \"Then I'll go. Brothel it is, then.\" Having said that, he continued to pat his ample chest with the large fan in his hand and walked south along the street. Liao San moved, and Nian Bing, who had been waiting, also moved. The hand holding the Morning Dew Blade emerged from his robe, and like an ordinary passerby, he slowly walked in Liao San's direction.\n\nJust a moment after Nian Bing followed Liao San away, the Eldest Manager, whom he had seen that morning, hurriedly walked out from Grand Success Pavilion. The Second Manager was currently standing at the entrance, arranging for guests, and seeing him, hastily asked, \"Eldest Brother, why are you in such a hurry? Did something happen in the Pavilion?\"\n\nThe flabby flesh on the Eldest Manager's face trembled slightly as he shook his head and said, \"Nothing has happened in the Pavilion, but the Boss just told me that a very distinguished guest will be coming here tomorrow. He instructed me to suspend operations tomorrow. After all the guests leave tonight, you and Old Three must supervise the servants to clean everything, inside and out, without the slightest oversight.\"\n\nThe Second Manager was stunned for a moment and said, \"Eldest Brother, what kind of guest is so distinguished? Even when Prince Dongming came here last time, the Boss didn't close for business! We have a large enterprise; closing for one day will mean a significant loss of income.\" The Eldest Manager said somewhat impatiently, \"Alright, stop asking. You'll know who it is tomorrow. Just do as I say, without the slightest oversight. Where's Old Three?\"\n\nThe Second Manager stammered a bit, \"Third Brother, Third Brother saw that there wasn't much going on in the Pavilion, said he wanted to go for a walk, so I let him go.\"\n\nThe Eldest Manager snorted, \"He must have gone to a brothel again. Who knows when he'll change these rotten habits of his. Now go quickly and drag him back for me. If we don't host the distinguished guest well tomorrow, none of us will have a good outcome.\"\n\nThe Second Manager acknowledged, and hastily chased in the direction the Third Manager had left.\n\nAs Liao San walked, he hummed a little tune that was badly off-key. In his heart, he was calculating which brothel he would go to find girls today. He had been lectured by Xue Jing this morning, and was filled with pent-up anger; how could he feel comfortable without finding a place to vent it? Turning a corner, he entered a narrow alley. He was too familiar with the geography of this area; as long as he passed through here, he would reach one of the best brothels.\n\n\"Stop. You've reached the end of the line.\" A cold voice came from behind. Liao San felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end, and he suddenly spun around, raising his fan to block in front of himself.\n\nWhat he saw was a man in black. Under the moonlight, it was discernible that the person was tall, broad-shouldered, and broad-backed. He was wearing a white skull mask on his head. The sudden sight startled him. \"Damn it, which son of a bitch is playing ghost? I'll chop you to death!\"",

    "content": "Chapter 2 is here, please vote more and collect more.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\"Why are you killing me? I think you're the one who died first.\" The man in black raised his right hand and the red light of fire suddenly lit up. A fireball appeared in his palm. The fireball became bigger and bigger. In just a few blinks, it turned into a human head size. The skull mask on the man in black looked even more strange under the illumination of the red light.\n\n\n\nLiao San was surprised and retreated a little, and said lustfully: \"You are a magician. It is the Qingfeng person who lets you deal with me, right?\"\n\n\n\nThe man in black said coldly, \"No, God wants to deal with you. You don't need to know who I am. Your life has reached the end. Go up to the ground and ask.\" The fireballs set off, and the fireballs were carrying a sound of noise, and rushed towards Liao San. Liao San was also a person who had seen the world. A group of yellow light lit up all over his body, and he saw the big fan in his hand and rushed forward with force. Although the magician has a respectable status, as long as he is not a level magician, the warrior will not eat in a one-to-one situation, so Liao San is not afraid of anything. He believes that with his own fighting, breaking the fireball on the other side is nothing, and he will slash the magician alive at that time.\n\n\n\nThe fireball came in a panic. As he was about to be reached by Liao San's big fan, the direction of the fireball's advance suddenly changed, from straight to flying, drawing a beautiful arc. Liao San's fight was blown away and hit the wall next to him again. His fight was indeed quite powerful. As the smoke spread, a big hole was knocked out of the wall next to the street. After this blow, Liao Sanhan came out in anger and rushed out of his fierce battle when he climbed up the wall. At this time, it was only the weakest time for his own defense to defend himself. \n\n\n\nThe dark blue light was so harsh, but at this time, it was like a soul-retaining messenger in the ground, the light was very delicate, and it looked like a blue light line at night. Liao San's fan had not yet been taken back. The blue light had already passed through his eyebrows and disappeared. Liao San's entire body stopped, and a violent swelling began to appear in his whole body. The fireball that had been flying before came from behind at this moment, and it was heavily impacted on Liao San's back. Liao Santon turned into a fireman at the time, but since his life had ended in the previous blue light, his roar was not available. Gao Wang's body fell to the ground, and the dark alley was illuminated by the fire. The man in black with a skull mask said in a somewhat sandy voice: \"I will give up ten times more to anyone who has a kindness to me, and I will lose my life if I have an enemy.\" He was just Nian Bing. He clearly remembered the insults in the morning that, after leaving the Ice God Tower, he swore that as long as he had strong power, he would never be insulted by anyone. Today is his first time killing someone, but he had no fear in his heart, as if Liao San's death was like a thorn in his death, and had nothing to do with him.The depressedness in his heart for many years was released because of killing Liao San. Nian Bing couldn't express his excitement in his heart. The dark side in his heart was fully released, and even a sinister breath radiated on him.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a cold breath came from behind, and the breath was sharp and sharp. Although it was not enough, it made Nian Bing feel a hind pain in her back. Without any hesitation, he pulled out the morning dew sword from the ground like a flash of light and blue light clothed into a piece of light and shadow spread to his back. At this moment, in his heart, everything was like firewood.\n\n\n\nWith a light sound, Nian Bing hummed, sprayed a mouthful of blood, flowing down along the mask, and retreated for more than ten steps before he could stand firm. The second shopkeeper of Dacheng appeared in his previous position, holding a folded long sword in his hand. At this time, he clearly felt a cold chill flowing towards him along the blade, and his whole body couldn't help but feel cold. When the fireball fell to Liao San's head, the second shopkeeper had actually come behind Nian Bing, but at that time he could not save Liao San. In order not to surprise Nian Bing, he did not make any sound. When the fireball exploded, he quietly urged his own fighting spirit and pulled out the slammed on his waist and stabbed Nian Bing from behind to the vital point of Nian Bing. However, he never expected that the other party was clearly a magician who could turn around in time and even cut off the sword in his hand. Although the blue light was hidden at a glance, he clearly felt that it must be an ultimate sword. \n\n\n\n    Slowly put down his raised hands, the second shopkeeper emitted a yellow light like Liao San’s body, and walked towards Nian Bing step by step. The same kind of fighting looks much thicker in him than Liao Sanfeng. As he walked, he stared at the skull mask on Nian Bing's face with both eyes and said coldly, \"Who are you? Why did you attack my third brother? Tell me, did Qingfeng send you here?\"\n\n\n\n\"Clean wind? Do you think they can instruct me?\" Although in the passive situation, Nian Bingzi was not at all agitated, standing firm and glaring at the second shopkeeper in front of him through the hole in the mask.\n\n\n\n\"Isn't it Qingfeng? Then who are you? Why do you kill my third brother? You don't say it, but I will make you unable to survive or die.\" The second shopkeeper's voice became even colder.\n\n\n\nNian Bing said calmly: \"I am a killer. You can call me a devil. Today I have killed you and don't want to take action again. There will be a period of time later.\" The red flames rose in the air without any signs, and rushed towards the second shopkeeper like a huge plane. The second shopkeeper was very familiar with Liao San's ability. Although he was not as good as himself, his fighting spirit was not much worse. He was killed in front of this mysterious man who was called the devil's murder. Suddenly, he saw the flame wall rolling towards him. He did not dare to be careless. He quickly dropped the slap in his hand, gathered his whole body to fight, and rushed towards the fire wall.\n\n\n\nThere was no sound, and Mars was four times. The second shopkeeper's fighting continued to roar in the narrow alley. He was surprised that the fire wall was not powerful at all. However, when Mars disappeared, the previous devil that had been far away was no longer visible.The fire on Liao San's body was burning, and a terror rose in the second shopkeeper's heart. The mysterious and unsuccessful destruction caused him to psychologically have a great pressure. He was a little scared, but he was afraid that the demons would hide in the darkness and attack him with that strange magic. \n\n\n\nNian Bing ran to a corner next to the street and stopped, gasping for a few breaths, applying a common treatment to himself, which made him feel more comfortable. The second shopkeeper's fight was condensed and not dissipated. If the morning dew knife had not interrupted his sword in time, Nian Bing would have been penetrated by a sword. Even so, the fight that was transmitted into his body at the moment of his sword was shocked. He was not a warrior, and as a magician, his weakest thing was his body. Firewall is a fifth-level magic, and Ice can use it, but it will definitely take a while to chant the spell. What he just used to escape was not the real firewall. Since he can condense the wind and snow, he can also spread an ordinary fireball into the size of a fire wall with his strong mental power. Nian Bing didn't know that because the veins in his body were constantly fighting with the magic power of the same origin of ice and fire, they became more than ordinary people who didn't know how much they could survive the battle from the sword. If they changed to an ordinary magician, even if they didn't die, they would never have the power to escape.\n\n\n\nAfter a breath for a while, the pain in the internal organs became weaker. The treatment was gradually dying. The name that the devil came up with was deeply imprinted in his brain. He secretly vowed that one day, the devil would bring death to those who had harmed his parents. As he thought, he quickly removed his clothes, wrapped his mask in it, and walked slowly towards the back door of Qingfeng.\n\n\n\nWhen Nian Bing returned to the clear wind, it was already late at night. She carefully pushed the back door and walked quietly towards the woodshed. From the back door to the woodshed, you need to pass the back garden. Uncle Li once jingled him. The back garden was a place dedicated to the boss Qingfeng. No servants were allowed to enter without instructions. The wall of the back garden was about two meters high, and there was a plum blossom-shaped sky above it. The green wall blended with the surrounding environment. With Nianbing's height, he could just see the situation inside from the plum blossom-shaped sky. He was walking forward along the path, and the light at the corner of his eyes accidentally appeared. A red shadow flashed across the plum blossom-shaped sky. His curious mind made him subconsciously walk into the pink sky and look at the back garden.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThe blog of Xiaosan has been updated again.

    "content": "Please vote more and collect more. This Sunday night, 12.o5 will be the same as usual. It’s not that the mistress doesn’t want to be fast. One is to master the quality. The other is that my body is not good recently. The inexplicable pain in my chest makes me unable to fall asleep all night. Today I went to the hospital for a final inspection. I hope everyone can explain it. Thank you.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIt was a graceful figure, a graceful figure, a long sword shining with red light flew up and down, bringing red lights, and the condensed fighting atmosphere was filled with strong waves, blowing the surrounding flowers, plants, trees, and keys. It was Xue Jingyuan who was dancing. She seemed to like red. Although she changed into a long dress, she still had the flame-like color. Her figure looked so strong, and her movements were as unrestrained as a storm. Nian Bing was a little confused. It was too late and she didn't go back to her room to sleep. Why was she still dancing here? Forget it, regardless of her, I should go back soon and use a few more treatments on my body. Let’s talk about it before curing the injury.\n\n\n\nThinking of this, he quietly turned around. Just when he was about to leave, he accidentally encountered a border of flowers and plants under his feet, making a very light sound.\n\n\n\n\"Who?\" Nian Bing thought to himself that it was not good, and hurriedly threw the black robe and mask in his hand among the flowers and plants as fast as possible. His action was just completed. A red cloud passed through the garden wall and appeared in front of him. When the red light pointed, the long sword in Xue Jingyu's hand had already been placed on Nian Bing's neck. The flow of air made him dare not have any rashness. \n\n\n\nXue Jing was obviously remembering Nian Bing’s handsome face, with a slight brow and said, “It’s you. Didn’t you let you go to the woodshed to help? Is it too late to have a good rest, so why do you run out and fuck?”\n\n\n\nNian Bing put out a look of fear and fear, \"Hello Miss, I'm new today. I wanted to go out to buy some daily necessities, but the things in Ice City are so expensive, so I didn't buy them. I just got here, and I was not familiar with the road and found a wrong direction, so I came back late. Didn't you sleep so late? \"\n\n\n\nXue Jing was obviously in a bad mood, so she hummed and took the red long sword back into the sheath, \"That's the case. If you let me do something unfavorable to the wind, be careful of your brain.\"\n\n\n\n\"I dare not, I dare not. I can eat some food, and I will definitely keep my duty as a lady. Miss, if there is nothing else, I will go back first.\" I thought to myself, and it seemed that my black robe and mask could only be taken later. After giving a slight gift to Xue Jing, he hurriedly walked towards the woodshed.\n\n\n\n\"Wait a minute.\" Xue Jing suddenly called Nian Bing, and Nian Bing's body stiffened and said to herself, \"How could she see what I threw in the flower pot?\" No, it's so dark, she's not a night cat.\n\n\n\nTurning over, he said, \"Miss, do you have any more instructions?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing looked up and down at Nian Bing's eyes, and suddenly, she flicked her body and came to him without any preparation. She grabbed the collar of his chest and stood up. Ten Yun felt the foggy feeling that Nian Bing had also felt it when using Wind Snow, but it was the first time he was so passively caught. The right hand touched the sword of Zhongchen, and the left hand prepared a magic at the same time. Once Xue Jing is going to be detrimental to him, he can react as quickly as possible. \n\n\n\nThe snow was slim in the head of the garden wall, and walked into the garden with Nian Bing's body. Wrapped in the red weather, several ups and downs have arrived on the eaves of an octagonal pavilion in the garden. He put Nian Bing aside and said in a low voice, \"Sit and don't move.\" In fact, Nian Bing didn't dare to move without saying that Nian Bing was not as good as the pavilion was four or five meters high. If it fell down, it would be unpleasant. He didn't understand why Xue Jing would bring him up, but he couldn't ask at this time. He could only carefully apply one treatment after another to himself. Once any changes occur, he could still better deal with it.\n\n\n\nXue Jing's elbows were placed on her bent knees, her beautiful eyes staring at the round moon in the sky, and her eyes were constantly flashing with the lost light. Nian Bing could see that she seemed to have something to worry about.\n\n\n\nOne of them was thinking about their own thoughts and was in a secret way. Who didn't say anything. Half a moment passed. Nian Bing felt that his inner organs were no longer as painful as before. He secretly relaxed his breath and quietly grabbed the Fire God Stone in his hand. Fire-type magic, using it to attack has always been the best choice. At this time, he couldn't help but recall the scene when he killed Liao San in seconds. He knew that with his own strength, even in a head-on confrontation, Liao San could be completely eliminated, but he was never as relaxed as he was at that time, because Liao San actually had a fighting spirit and looked quite weak, so he should have the ability of a sci-technician. The reason why I was able to kill him successfully was because I cleverly used two magics to attract three levels of explosive fireballs, and then used my point-based attack on the ice star pins based on the ice blade technique combined with the fine pins in the cooking art. This worked and killed Liao in the alley in three seconds. Although the Ice Blade is only a second-level ice magic, it is definitely powerful after being compressed into a slat. As long as the opponent's fighting spirit is not very strong, you can completely attack directly with the advantages of simplicity. \n\n\n\n\"Why don't you say anything?\" Nian Bing's ears suddenly sounded snowy and calmly heard his ears. He was shocked and his body subconsciously dodged to the side. His feet slid down, and in awe of shock, he slid down the pavilion. Under the loss of balance, Nian Bing couldn't help but grab Xue Jing's skirt with both hands. Nian Bing was startled by Xue Jing. He suddenly slid down, and he also snorted Xue Jing. She only felt that her body sank and fell to the pavilion as she pulled down. The two of them fell down to the pavilion at the same time. Xue Jingyu had been practicing martial arts since childhood and reacted very quickly. His body turned around in the air, slapped Nianbing's waist, and his other hand shot down, using the reaction force of the fight to send himself and Nianbing to the pavilion again.\n\n\n\n  Silent, absolutely silence.Nian Bing and Xue Jinghu were facing each other, and the two maintained a strange posture. Xue Jinghu was flipping Nian Bing's waist. Nian Bing folded her hand with one hand and grabbed her skirt. Xue Jinghu's half of her snow-white thighs were exposed in the air because the skirt was lifted up. Nian Bing's hand that hooked her neck kept slidding, and his heartbeat increased by twice. For a while, he was blank in the brain. He was always full of wisdom, but at this time he was at a loss.\n\n\n\n\"Bastard.\" Xue Jing suddenly opened his hand and slapped Nian Bing on the face. He fell off the pavilion even more. Xue Jing hooked his feet and picked Nian Bing up next to him, patted him with his hands holding his skirt, and looked at him in anger. Nian Bing was stunned by Xue Jing's palm, and covered his face with his hands. He didn't know what to do. Xue Jing's eyes gradually changed when he looked at him. A faint water fog gradually became thicker, and the rind water circle was rolling around her eyes. Suddenly, she burst into tears as if she was wronged, and the rind water kept slidding beside her face. \n\n\n\n\"Miss, I, I didn't mean it.\" Nian Bing tried to explore. A beautiful woman was crying in front of him, and he didn't know what he should do now.\n\n\n\nXue Jing suddenly raised her head and looked at Nian Bing angrily, \"Everyone said that she would not let you move, who would make you disturb.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"I was shocked by you. Do you think I want to move?\" At this time, the previous fragrance scene was still replaying in front of him. He had forgotten his identity.\n\n\n\nXue Jingyun stared at Nian Bing with her big eyes, \"That's not your fault. Whoever kept you from talking for half a while.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said in surprise: \"Didn't you let me sit and not move? You grabbed me.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing knew his reason and wiped off the purplish water from her face with her sleeve, hummed, and said, \"Everyone is a hero who saves the beauty. Today I came to save the beauty once. You are such a big boy in vain.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"Just pack, just put it in.\" I can't tell Xue Jingyuan. Actually, I am a magician. I haven't seen the craft in the clear wind yet, and everything still takes time.\" The hand touching his face now had a palm-shaped mark on his left face. He could only have the lowest level of treatment. Even if he used it every day, he would probably not be able to see anyone for three days. The first time I was killed, I was killed. After finally running back, I was slapped inexplicably. It was really unlucky, and I was stuffed with teeth.\n\n\n\nXue Jingyu returned to her previous posture again, and her expression calmed down on her face. She looked at the moon in the sky and said, \"Where did you come from?\"\n\n\n\n\"Me?\" Nian Bing said, \"I am from the Huarong Empire.\" This was the first time he mentioned his homeland. Even when he first learned about cooking art, he never asked him this question.\n\n\n\n\"Huarong Empire? It's Huarong, the one called the Fire Empire. It's also the farthest away from our Ice Moon Empire. Why did you travel here and come here?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said lightly, \"Who is willing to leave the country?Isn’t it all forced by fate? When I was ten years old, I came to the Ice Moon Empire with my father, but now I am the only one left. \"\n\n\n\nXue Jing turned her head and looked at Nian Bing, \"Look at it, are you worried too?\"",

Everyone is welcome to participate.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNian Bingxin was shocked. She had been awake from her memory and secretly slandering herself. How could her vigilance become so bad? It seems that the power of a beauty is indeed quite great! \"Miss, why use it?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing glared at him and said, \"You have been calling you for a long time? Why did you call me again?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said helplessly, \"It's just that villain has failed. I should call your lady right.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing slapped his hand impatiently and said, \"Forget it, I'm very upset today. I just want to chat with someone. Don't call me a lady, call me Xue Jing slur. I originally wanted to talk to Ling Er, but she didn't understand that, and instead made me even more confused. Oh, by the way, what's your name?\"\n\n\n\n\"My name is Nian Bing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then tell me, what kind of woman is the most popular among men?\" After Xue Jingguang plucked up the courage to ask this sentence, Xiaoying immediately rose to two groups of red hair. \n\n\n\nNian Bing thought to himself that this young lady with a clear wind is probably Sichun. \"Miss, oh, no, Xue Jing, I don't know much about this, but, a beautiful girl like Miss must be loved by all men.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing heard this, and her beautiful eyes were filled with purgation again, \"You nonsense, why doesn't he like me? He looks cool all day long, and he ignores people's words.\"\n\n\n\n  I am not a person involved, how can I know the situation? Nian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"Miss, you may have to ask him yourself, or maybe, he doesn't say anything, but he likes you in his heart?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jingyu shook off the purplish water in her eyes and said with some surprise: \"What are you saying really?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said suspiciously, \"It should be right. Since you like him, just get as close as you can, and those with ambition will succeed.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing beat Nian Bing and said, \"But he is a girl. How can girls take the initiative in this matter? Nian Bing, you just said that all men must like her as beautiful girls as I am. Do you like me?\"\n\n\n\n\"Ahem.\" Nian Bing almost died of spitting out of her own, \"Miss, don't make a joke, our identities are different!\"\n\n\n\nXue Jingguan insisted: \"No matter, it doesn't matter if we don't look at our identity now. If we were friends, would you like me?\"\n\n\n\nFrom Nian Bing's inner thoughts, he prefers girls with gentle temper like Dragon Spirit or Fengnian. He doesn't catch a cold like a hot-sex beauty like Xue Jing, but at this time he looked at the purplish water in Xue Jing's eyes, and he couldn't bear to say something negative, so he had to lightly point his head and said embarrassedly, \"I like it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hmph, it seems to be very eager. However, if you remember what I said today, if you don't want you to do anything in the future, you won't refuse it. Have you heard it?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing replied with a wry smile. What can he do if he doesn’t answer at this time? Xue Jing turned around and faced Mingyue again, murmured, \"He is really stylish, but he seems not as beautiful as you in terms of appearance, but he is already a master swordsman close to the martial arts family. His posture of the sword is particularly beautiful, and you can't even get enough of a majestic feeling. I like someone like him who is as heroic as him. No, I must try his best when looking for opportunities. Otherwise, I'm not willing to give up on anything.\"\n\n\n\nThis night, Nian Bing accompanied Xue Jing to sit in the pavilion until dawn, and Xue Jing Jing took him out of the garden and let him leave. It’s nothing to sleep all night, but this is the first time in years that I have never meditated at night without meditation. When he returned to his room, he didn't sleep anymore. He tried hard to use healing techniques on himself, hoping to transform the slap on his face, so that the magician would go to see the magic spell, but things and wishes were not bad. His primary treatment effect was actually limited. Although the slap print was a little lighter, it still existed clearly. In desperation, Nian Bing had to quietly leave before dawn, find a pharmacy that was operating at night, buy some white cloth, and put it into a thick stack, and stick it to his left face with a plastic cloth. Although this is not good-looking, it is much better than a red slap on the face.\n\n\n\nAfter yawning, Uncle Li walked out of his room, breathed the fresh air, stretched out his body, twisted his head and glanced at the room on the other side, and said to himself, \"I didn't know if this guy Nian Bing had come back last night. He is a young man, just having fun.\"\n\n\n\n\"Uncle Li, I came back a little late last night, sorry.\" Nian Bing pushed out the door. He had just returned from outside for a short time and put away his black robe and mask, and he didn't even have time to sit down.\n\n\n\nUncle Li looked at the cloth on his face and couldn't help but ask in surprise: \"What are you doing? Are you injured?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"I was walking on the road yesterday. I was accidentally mixed up with something, but my face broke. I had to use some medicine. The doctor said it would take three or four days to heal.\"\n\n\n\nUncle Li laughed and said, \"You! You are so stupid, a handsome young man. It would be bad if you leave a scar on your face. Be careful in the future. Let's go and have breakfast.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing is indeed tired. Last time I ate it at the girl yesterday at noon.Under Uncle Li's belt, the two people walked towards the kitchen. Far away, they saw two rows of wooden tables with long rows of wooden tables at the kitchen door. There were about thirty or forty people wearing white chef's uniforms sitting there eating and drinking. Nian Bing said, \"It's so early for the people in the kitchen to get up!\"\n\n\n\nUncle Li said, \"Of course you have to get up early. Every morning is the busiest. They have to prepare the materials they need for the day. The materials we use for clearing wind are all carefully selected top-quality products. Just selecting materials, there are three or four people responsible. Let's go and see what to eat today?\"\n\n\n\nEarly meals are buns and porridge, and most of the chefs know Uncle Li. Under Uncle Li's introduction, Nian Bing greeted them one by one. When Uncle Li took him to the last wooden table, Nian Bing saw that there was only one person sitting here eating next to the table, and the other chefs felt very self-consciously going to other tables and eating their own. \n\n\n\n\"Nian Bing, this is our chef who is Qingfeng, and there are Mingyuan and Ming masters named by the King of Miao Jiao. Come see. The chef, his name is Nian Bing, is a newcomer to me. His hands and feet are still diligent, and I will trouble you to take care of you in the future.\" Uncle Li introduced for Nian Bing earnestly.\n\n\n\nMingyuan has a medium figure, neither fat nor thin. When he heard Uncle Li’s introduction, he raised his head to Nian Bing. He looked at him in his forties. Although his appearance was ordinary, his eyes made Nian Bing feel familiar. He also saw the same look in his eyes, but he was much worse than the one who checked him. Chaxian once told Nian Bing that a capable chef had a different look than that of an ordinary chef. Because he had been focusing on cooking art for many years, he told Nian Bing that although Nian Bing had learned all his cooking art, there was still a difference in temperature and feeling, and the feeling needed insight as support.\n\n\n\nMingyuan's expression was very cold, and Xiang Nianbing slightly pointed his head and continued to eat his morning time.\n\n\n\nUncle Li took Nian Bing to a table next to him. The two of them also ate it. The buns were meaty, but the taste was far worse. However, when one was hungry, as long as there was something to fill his stomach, it was enough.\n\n\n\nJust as Nian Bing was eating and preparing to go back to have sex with Uncle Li, the person he didn't want to see appeared again, and the red figure walked in.\n\n\n\n\"Uncle Ming, what good things to eat in the morning! Is there a portion of mine?\" The appearance of snow and silence made all the staff in the kitchen stop their actions and stood up to show her a gift. Only Ming Yuanyi sat in his seat. He looked at Xue Jing with some nudity and said, \"You are here, have you sent it to me long ago? Why did you still come here to ask for it? Is there something wrong with me?\" At this time, there was a faint smile on his cold face.\n\n\n\nThe snow was quiet and didn't sleep all night, but at this time I was mentally unhappy. \"If you have nothing to do, can't you look for you? Can't my niece miss you?\"\n\n\n\nMing Yuan laughed and said, \"Miss me? I see, you want to eat snacks I made. Tell me, today do you want to eat 点, candy rolls, or golden roulettes?Uncle has nothing to do in the morning, so I will give it to you if I have time. \"",

    "content": "The time for the Sunday Summary Conference will not change. Everyone is welcome to participate.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAfter hearing the words of the three cakes, \"Candy Roll\" and \"Golden Fragrance\" and \"Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a little excited. Among these three cakes, he heard that \"Candy Roll\" and \"Golden Fragrance\" are both famous snacks, but there are very few people who can master the heat and make it well. But, what is the squid? Since the Ming Yuan Dynasty is called the King of Miaoxia, I believe he is more good at cooking methods. If you have the opportunity, you must teach you how to cook this method.\n\n\n\nXue Jing thought for a while and said, \"Uncle Ming, then I want to eat the golden fragrance circle. You also know that people love to eat this one the most. Otherwise, teach me how to do it?\"\n\n\n\nMingyuan deliberately made a shock and said, \"You? Let's forget it. It doesn't matter if your father agrees to burn the windy kitchen. I will teach you. Otherwise, uncle wants to live for a few more years and give you more delicious food? However, I said, although the golden fragrance ring is crispy and oily, it is still bigger, which is not very good for the skin.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing smiled and said, \"I don't eat it every day, so it's okay to eat it once.\"\n\n\n\nMingyuan stood up and said, \"Okay, come with me. Uncle will make it for you now, and the ingredients are ready.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing smiled slightly and slapped a few low words on Mingyuan's ears. After Mingyuan finished listening, his eyebrows were slightly snaked, and his eyes fell on Nian Bing, who was far away. After thinking for a while, he said, \"You will be troubled by me. However, I said, I will only do it once, and how much I can learn is his own problem.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jingxiu said, \"I just knew that uncle is the best.\"\n\n\n\nMingyuan said unhappily, \"Don't just let the little white face confuse you. You are such a head! There is really no way.\" After saying that, he walked towards the kitchen first.\n\n\n\nNian Bing now glanced at himself when Mingyuan left, and his eyes seemed to contain a warning. Could it be that the whispers that just snowed in his ears had something to do with him? As he was thinking, he suddenly heard Xue Yuan shouting, \"Nian Bing, come here and fight Uncle Ming.\" As soon as she said this, all the chefs turned their eyes on Nian Bing, and all kinds of strange expressions appeared. No need to ask, many people had already thought about it wrong. You should know that the King of Miao Jiao Mingyuan has always been famous for his own treasures. When cooking, he never asked others to watch. Xue Jing's call was obviously to let Nian Bing learn from him how to make the golden incense circle.\n\n\n\nNian Bing stood up, pointed to his nose and said, \"Miss, you call me? I'm just chopping wood!\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing glared at him and said angrily, \"If you come, you will come, you will talk so much. Hurry.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was helpless and had to walk to Xue Jingyu and asked in a low voice: \"What are you doing?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing smiled slightly and said, \"I'm sorry to give you this slap on the face.I tell you, I don’t know how many people want to learn Uncle Ming’s destiny. This opportunity will be very difficult. You have to work harder. As long as you can get a few points, you will have a budget for eating in the future. If you practice well, I will ask Uncle Ming to transfer you from the woodshed room to the kitchen. \"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at Xue Jing with strange eyes. This hot-tempered girl seemed to have her love. \n\n\n\nXue Jingqing's pretty face turned slightly and pushed Nian Bing, \"Go away quickly. Don't think wrong. Last night you stayed with me for a long time, and I beat you again. I just want to compensate you. What's wrong? I might even ask you to help me with you in the future.\"\n\n\n\nThe two of them said that they had already entered the kitchen. Qingfeng was worthy of being a famous hotel. The kitchen was only a thousand square meters. Although the place was very large and it was filled with various materials, it was not even a bit irresistible. It seemed that they had been cleaned up carefully. All kinds of kitchenware were placed in a tidy manner. Xue Jing pulled Nian Bing and walked to the bottom, and said, \"Uncle Ming usually doesn't want to go down the kitchen. Only important guests can taste the dishes he made with his hands. Of course, I am an exception.\"\n\n\n\nThe place where Mingyuan cooks is covered by a circle of curtains. It is obvious that someone doesn’t want anyone to see his cooking style. Nian Bing’s heart is secretly sneered. These famous chefs are all so stingy. How can the chefs be vigorously promoted?\n\n\n\nXue Jing and Nian Bing lifted the curtain and entered Mingyuan's private cooking space, which was about 20 square meters. Mingyuan glanced at them and said coldly to Nian Bing: \"I only do it once, and I will act quickly. If you have to see how careful you can learn, it depends on your own luck.\" As soon as the words fell, his hands immediately started to move.\n\n\n\nOnly see Mingyuan grabbed it with his left hand, pulled a clean empty basin from the side, and scooped about a pound of noodles with a dough spoon with his right hand and put it into the basin. At the same time, the left hand scoops up half a spoon of water from the other side. The two hands did different actions in the smooth injection surface, but the spoon was not confused at all. Nian Bing knew that this was the famous double-handed approach in the world of cooking arts. The mind was divided into two parts and had to focus on what it was done. At this time, Mingyuan's right hand took out some white powder from three white tuning boxes and added it to the flour. He said plainly: \"White and hydrate to salt, rinse, and a little bit of glutinous rice. This is the foundation.\" As soon as the words fell, the work in his hand was completed. With both hands, the tools in his hand had returned to their own positions. The two hands were inserted into the basin at the same time, and quickly started to move. In just a few blinks, the flour and ingredients that had been dispersed before have turned into a noodle group. \n\n\n\nNian Bing knew very well that what to put is secondary. The most important thing is the amount of putting it. The kneading method is also very detailed. The wrist must be strong. Moreover, the direction and order of the kneading are different, and the finished products will be different. Although the cooking of the golden fragrance circle was just beginning, Nian Bing had already seen a lot of things and was secretly in his heart. Experts are indeed masters. It seems that he has not been in vain for such a clean wind.Mingyuan's movements were getting faster and faster, and the noodles kept turning into various shapes in his hands, sometimes growing strips and sometimes flat pieces. There is no time for a single piece to stop. If you are an ordinary chef, when making the golden incense ring, you need to put the dough for a half hour before you can continue the process. The reason why Mingyuan kept kneading the dough was because he wanted to save this awakening process. This requires extremely high technology and familiarity with the fusion of the opposite and several modular materials. It was only this point that Mingyuan had already proved that his three words \"Miao Jia Wang\" were not just plain.\n\n\n\nFinally, after kneading the dough for about a minute, the noodles were placed in a round shape on the chopping board. Mingyuan looked very cold and calm, as if the kneading dough with a large amount of motion had no effect on him. He glanced at Nian Bing and said, \"I see clearly, there is a key below.\" As he said, he used flint to light the boiler, put a clean iron bulb on the boiler, and injected half a tiny of oil.\n\n\n\nA thick rolling bark about 1.5 meters long entered his hand, with just a few simple actions. The noodle group on the chopping board had turned into flat pieces, and the action was very fast afterwards. It was obvious that Mingyuan did not want Nian Bing to learn too much from him. Get a knife for making noodles. The knife light flashing flat sheet has become a uniform length of about two inches wide. Take it into a strip of surface blank and place it on the chopping board. Mingyuan presses one end with one hand and holds the other end of the surface blank with the other hand, and strokes it into a long flat sheet about two inches thick. Use a knife to cut the surface into a half-thick agent. Each two agents are tied together. Cut it into a knife in the middle of the knife. Nian Bing can see it clearly. There is no cutting between the two sides, so just a little bit. At this time, the oil has reached 50% hot.\n\n\n\nMingyuan slapped his right hand, and the semi-finished golden fragrance circle had been slid into the pot. A pair of chopsticks jumped into his left hand from somewhere. The chopsticks slapped in the center of the oily surface, and it turned into a circular circle like a magical technique, shaped like a handpiece. Under the action of the chopsticks, it kept turning, and his other hand was not leisurely. One after another, one golden fragrance circle was constantly entering the pot. Snow slammed and hurriedly took the plate, and the golden golden fragrance circles came out one after another, which was always full of fragrance, which was a different way of eating. When the tenth golden incense of exactly the same size circled out of the pot, Mingyuan stopped moving, and put a fire on one side and said to Xue Jing: \"Silent, look, see if your Uncle Ming's handcraft has retreated.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing smiled and said, \"Uncle Ming's handwriting is the best, how can he retreat? Hey, Nian Bing, you...\"",

    "content": "Sunday's Refinement Assembly time remains unchanged. Everyone is welcome to attend.\n\n***\n\nWhen the first Golden Fragrance Ring came out of the pot, Nian Bing had already forgotten everything, completely immersed in Ming Yuan's masterful culinary skills. At this moment, he was holding a pair of chopsticks, picked up a Golden Fragrance Ring, took a bite, nodded approvingly, and muttered to himself, \"Fragrant, crispy, crunchy, crumbles at the slightest touch. Truly excellent craftsmanship!\"\n\nSeeing Nian Bing overstep his bounds and eat the Golden Fragrance Ring first, Ming Yuan was about to speak, but then he heard Nian Bing continue, \"Slender hands twist jade strands, emerald oil fries to a tender, deep yellow. Spring slumber at night, light or heavy, presses flat a beauty's armlet of gold.* Good, truly a superb Golden Fragrance Ring.\"\n\nXue Jing said, displeased, \"Nian Bing, what are you doing? Who told you to eat my breakfast?\"\n\nNian Bing exclaimed in surprise, only then waking up. He quickly stuffed the Golden Fragrance Ring into his mouth, placed the chopsticks aside, and mumbled, \"I'm sorry, Miss, the head chef's skill is truly too exquisite, so, I...\" As he spoke, he hastily swallowed the Golden Fragrance Ring, a hint of embarrassment on his face.\n\nMing Yuan looked at Nian Bing in surprise, and said in a deep voice, \"Who are you? How do you know the recipe incantation for Golden Fragrance Rings?\"\n\nNian Bing paused, then smiled and said, \"I just heard it from someone who used to run a roadside stall. I felt it was very fitting for the Golden Fragrance Ring, so I memorized it. Please don't laugh at my presumption.\"\n\nMing Yuan snorted, \"Don't lie without considering your audience. If everyone knew the recipe incantation for Golden Fragrance Rings, I wouldn't need to be in this business.\"\n\nXue Jing looked at Nian Bing in surprise, about to say something, when hurried footsteps were heard from outside. \"Miss, Head Chef, it's bad, something has happened.\"\n\nXue Jing lifted the curtain and stepped out, seeing a Clear Wind Pavilion servant rushing over, covered in sweat. She couldn't help but frown and say, \"Why are you in such a panic? What happened? Speak slowly.\"\n\nThe servant panted, \"Miss, recent news is that for some unknown reason, the City Lord has suddenly sealed all four gates of Ice Snow City, not allowing anyone to enter or exit. Furthermore, Grand Accomplishment Pavilion suddenly closed today, and I also heard that their Third Steward suddenly died last night.\"\n\n\"Dead? Mangy dog Liao San is dead? What on earth is going on?\"\n\nNian Bing and Ming Yuan had also come out by this time. Ming Yuan calmly said, \"Jingjing, don't rush. Let's go, we'll find your father together and see if he knows what's happening.\"\n\nXue Jing nodded eagerly, and quickly walked out with Ming Yuan. Before leaving, Ming Yuan turned his head to glance at Nian Bing. \"I'll find you later. You can go back to the woodshed for now.\"\n\nNian Bing breathed a sigh of relief, thinking to himself, *I originally planned to stay here a bit longer, but it looks like I won't be able to hide my culinary skills much longer. It's a pity I still don't know what special techniques the chefs at Grand Accomplishment Pavilion possess. Never mind, if I can't hide it, I'll just go to Feng Nü. Once the Zheng Yang Dao is fully inlaid, I'll quietly leave Ice Snow City. Why is Ice Snow City sealed today, and Grand Accomplishment Pavilion closed for business? Liao San's death shouldn't warrant sealing the entire city.*\n\nGrand Accomplishment Pavilion.\n\nThe resplendent hall seemed somewhat solemn today. The entire hall was impeccably clean, and among dozens of tables, only a large central one was occupied. There were over ten people in total, but only one was seated; the rest stood respectfully behind her.\n\nIt was a woman, a woman with white hair, sitting there like a statue carved from icy jade. Her white robe with gold trim accentuated her cool and noble demeanor. Her exquisite beauty made it impossible for anyone to harbor the slightest thought of disrespect. A layer of frosty mist seemed to rise around her body. Her eyes were closed, and her entire being was so cold as to be unapproachable.\n\nAmong the more than ten people standing behind the woman, apart from a mage dressed in a blue magic robe, everyone else seemed somewhat trembling. The mage's blue robe had a golden hexagram pattern on its chest, with a rising vortex embroidered in the center of the hexagram, looking exceedingly luxurious.\n\n\"Why hasn't the head of the Martial Skills Guild arrived?\" the white-robed woman, seated upright, finally spoke. The hall seemed to grow even colder.\n\nA middle-aged man in luxurious attire quickly stepped forward and respectfully said, \"Reporting, Lady Goddess Priest. The head of the Martial Skills Guild is away on official business. He rarely stays in Ice Snow City normally, so he is not present.\" The one seated in Grand Accomplishment Pavilion's main hall was none other than the Ice Snow Goddess Priest, who had traveled to search for the Ice Snow Goddess Stone—the continent's only individual with the title of God Descender. Only she, as a symbol of the Ice Moon Empire and the strongest in the magical world, could, with a single word, seal off the Ice Moon Empire's second-largest city.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priest said indifferently, \"You are all the leaders of various factions within Ice Snow City. I give you three days to investigate every corner of Ice Snow City and find the Ice Snow Goddess Stone. If the wielder's power is very strong, you only need to force them to use the divine stone's magic, and I will personally resolve everything.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man who spoke earlier said with some difficulty, \"Lady Goddess Priest, as you know, Ice Snow City is very large. Isn't three days a bit too short?\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priest's eyes slowly opened, and a cold blue light shot out, illuminating the middle-aged man. He immediately shivered, retreating several steps before regaining his footing. \"Marquis Nuo Ya, if you feel that the position of Ice Snow City Lord is not suitable for you, I can help you make adjustments at any time.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Marquis Nuo Ya's face immediately changed dramatically. He quickly said, \"No, Lady Goddess Priest, that's not what I meant. How would we dare defy your orders? However, without any clues, I cannot guarantee that we will definitely find it.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priest let out a cold snort and said, \"Last night, on my way here, I clearly felt the energy dispersion of the Ice Snow Goddess Stone. It must be in Ice Snow City. If this matter is not handled well, you will be the first one I hold accountable.\"\n\nMarquis Nuo Ya's face was contorted in a bitter expression at this moment. Searching for a stone in such a large city was undoubtedly like finding a needle in a haystack, especially with only three days. Sealing the city for three days would inevitably have a huge impact on Ice Snow City, and the entire city's operations would run into problems. But he had no other option at this point; reasoning with the Ice Snow Goddess Priest was useless. He nodded helplessly and said, \"I will do my utmost.\"\n\n\"Lady Goddess Priest, I have something I don't know if I should say.\" A humble voice came from behind. The speaker was Grand Accomplishment Pavilion's Second Steward. He and the Head Steward had been standing at the back the whole time. His sudden utterance at this moment immediately caused the people in front to turn and look. One elderly man in golden robes said in a deep voice, \"Impudent! What right do you have to speak in front of Lady Goddess Priest?\"\n\nFear showed in the Second Steward's eyes. He quickly said, \"Yes, Master.\"\n\n\"No matter. If it's related to the Ice Snow Goddess Stone, let him speak.\" The Ice Snow Goddess Priest's gaze fell upon the Second Steward. The Second Steward felt a chill spread through his entire body, as if he were laid bare before everyone, without any secrets.\n\n\"Yes, yes, Lady Goddess Priest, it's like this. Last night, my third brother, who is Grand Accomplishment Pavilion's Third Steward, was suddenly murdered. The one who killed him was a mage.\"\n\n\"Died by what magic?\" The Ice Snow Goddess Priest's words were concise.\n\nThe Second Steward paused, then said, \"I don't know much about magic. It seemed to be a large fireball.\"\n\nGrand Accomplishment Pavilion's Owner said angrily, \"Is something wrong with your head? Didn't Lady Goddess Priest just say it must be related to the Ice Snow Goddess Stone? Get down! Don't waste Lady Goddess Priest's time.\"\n\nThe Second Steward said urgently, \"No, Owner, please hear me out. Although my third brother died by a fireball, it's very strange. The fireball struck him, his whole body was engulfed in flames and burned black, but his head wasn't blackened. Instead, a layer of frost formed on it, and it's still there now. Perhaps, perhaps...\"\n\nA cold glint flashed in the Ice Snow Goddess Priest's eyes. She said indifferently, \"Bring the body up for me to see.\"\n\n\"Yes, Lady Goddess Priest.\" Grand Accomplishment Pavilion's Owner quickly assented. In a moment, Liao San's body was brought up. Under the scorching flames, his body had already turned to charcoal, and a pungent stench assailed everyone's nostrils, causing them to cover their noses. A faint layer of white light enveloped the Ice Snow Goddess Priest's body. Without seeing her make a move, her slender form was already before the corpse. Her jade-like hand, like a spring onion, extended from her robe and pressed downwards in the air. Mental power, channeled through ice elements, instantly enveloped the charred body. Others might not have felt anything, but Long Zhi, the Wind Archmage who served as the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild President, was greatly astonished in his heart. Although it wasn't the first time, given his status, that he had witnessed the Ice Snow Goddess Priest—a God Descender and the Ice Moon Empire's Imperial Advisor—cast magic, seeing her so effortlessly use a mental probing spell without needing to chant any incantation truly showed she deserved the title of the continent's foremost mage.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priest slowly raised her head, her eyes blazing with cold light. Her gaze fell upon the Second Steward beside her. \"Speak. Describe last night's situation in detail.\"\n\nThe Second Steward assented, and immediately, with utmost trepidation, meticulously described the situation from last night, not daring to omit a single detail. Under the Ice Snow Goddess Priest's invisible, immense pressure, he didn't even dare to conceal Liao San's visit to a brothel.** When he mentioned that the black-clad man introduced himself as a Demon Assassin, the expressions of everyone present couldn't help but turn grim. On the Yangguang Continent, the most loathed profession was not prostitutes, nor thieves or robbers, but assassins. Mages, especially those unsuited for close combat, particularly detested the assassin profession. This was because even high-ranking mages would find it difficult to survive an assassin's sneak attack if caught unprepared. However, this was their first time hearing of mages existing among assassins, and it was clear this particular mage was no ordinary one.\n\n---\n* The poem is a classical Chinese description of a kind of fried dough snack, emphasizing its delicate nature and resemblance to ancient armlets.\n** Literally \"going to the matter of [an illicit place],\" a common euphemism in Chinese for visiting a brothel or engaging in prostitution.",

    "content": "Tonight, the 12:05 Essence Grand Grand will be held as usual. Everyone is welcome to participate.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAfter listening to the story of the second shopkeeper, the Ice and Snow Goddess's sacrifice was slow, \"The Demonic Killing? It seems that there should be more than one person at that time. You are smart, and you can see some clues from the death of Liao San. It's true that his real cause of death was not the explosion of flames. Before the explosion of flames, his head was already iced. It was a magical injury. My brain was washed by the ice cream. He was already dead before the explosion of the flames. Look, his head was a little charred because of the ice cream, but it was still intact. Through my mental exploration, I found that his wound was very small, only the size of a hole, so it should be a snail. It seems to be killed by a stylus attack, and in his head, there is clearly the smell of the Stone of the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess. It is obvious that this magician was scattered through the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess. This magician who killed him was extremely powerful in magic control, and could condense the ice into a stylus and penetrate the hardest bones of a person. You should also have the power of a demon sect. The fire magician you see is obviously just a cover. Only with the cooperation of two magic killers can the scene at that time be formed. Long Zhi immediately gathered all the ice magicians in the city here. Whoever has the breath of the Stone of the Ice Goddess, who is the hand.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhixi hesitated for a moment and said, \"Goddess Priest, I think the magicians under my command should not be assassinated. You also know that magicians have a high status in the mainland. With Liao San's identity, I'm afraid there is no need for magicians of the magician level to take action. The combination of killers composed of two magicians is obviously something else in this, and I hope you can investigate it clearly.\"\n\n\n\nThe goddess priest obviously has a bit of favor for Long Zhi. It is not as unpretentious as when he slammed the Marquis before, and said calmly: \"What you said is reasonable, but people who know each other but not your heart. If you bring them all here, through my inspection, you will naturally clarify everything. It seems that the goddess of ice and snow The time for stones to be obtained is quite long, and the number of ice magicians is very limited. It seems that the people hidden in the dark are not simple. Do as I do, fight to solve everything in the shortest time, and at the same time, send other magicians under your command to sit in the four cities of Ice and Snow City. Do you understand what I mean?\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi pointed respectfully and said, \"I'll go now.\" After speaking, his body flashed with a blue light. When everyone came back to his senses, his body had disappeared. A strange light appeared in the eyes of the Ice and Snow Goddess Priest, and he thought to himself that Long Zhi was indeed the most outstanding magic genius in the mainland. However, at his age of fifty, the wind-type magic has reached the point of pure green fire. If he had his own point of view, it would be unsure that within twenty years, another god-type god-type god-type god-type god-type god-type god-type god-type god-type will appear in the Ice Moon Empire. But, do you need to do that? The dignity of the Ice God Tower cannot be violated....\n\n\n\nNian Bing was chopping firewood in the woodshed room. He just answered Uncle Li’s various questions and finally got over it. The Miao Chef Wang Mingyuan shocked him a lot. His skillful skills were definitely not achieved by practicing alone. He is worthy of being a chef at Qingfeng. However, he is still a little worse than he thought, because he can also make the same golden fragrance circle, at most it is a little slower than him. Although he had seen something, Xue Jing didn't seem to have realized it. This time she took herself to learn the techniques of the Golden Fragrance Circle from Mingyuan, probably to replenish these five fingers on her face. \n\n\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing couldn't help but smile and touched her face covered by a cloth. Although the palm prints were gradually evaporating, it would probably take at least two days to continue thinking about it. This palm is really not light! However, Xue Jing's toned thigh looks attractive, and her skin feels..., she shook her head hard, Nian Bing secretly curled herself, thinking about these messy fuckings. She has not reported her great grudges. Now the most important thing is to gradually improve her strength, rather than focus on this aspect. It seems that the girl can't go there at the moment. If she sees the palm prints on her face, she doesn't know what she would think. The same is true for the magicians. Let's talk about it in a few days. He was confused and did not know that it was because of Xue Jing's slap that he stayed in the woodshed for three days before he could avoid the fatal disaster.\n\n\n\nThree days have passed. Nian Bing is like an ordinary servant. Every day, he chops firewood. In addition to chopping firewood, he can calmly cultivate his own ice and fire magic. During the cultivation, the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess only absorbs the ice elements between the world, and does not release ice-type magic. Therefore, no matter how strong the Ice and Snow Goddess' ability to sacrifice is, it is impossible to take his place. Nian Bing had been waiting for Mingyuan to come to find him, but Mingyuan never showed up. He didn't eat with the chefs every day when he ate. Because he watched Mingyuan's process of making the golden fragrance circle that day with Xue Jing's help, the other chefs were a little distant to him. Except for Uncle Li, there was basically no one in the kitchen who would take the initiative to talk to him. Nian Bing was also happy to be clean, so naturally he would not take the initiative to say hello to them.\n\n\n\nThree days passed, and the slap prints on the face finally disappeared. Nian Bing completed his work in the morning, told Uncle Li, and quietly slipped out from behind Qingfeng.\n\n\n\nAt this time, the north gate of Ice and Snow City had been completely resolute under the guard of thousands of soldiers. The city lord, the president of the Magician Association, and the big figures in the Ice and Snow City all secretly relaxed their voices at this time. The plague god in his heart is finally about to leave, so how can they not be happy? After three days of strict search, there was no one the Ice Goddess Sacrifice was looking for. The two ice magicians in the Magic Master Association also used her spiritual exploration. In order to achieve the normal transfer of Ice and Snow City, the Ice Goddess Sacrifice had to give up everything at a time. \n\n\n\n\"Marquis. Thank you for your help this time. The person holding the Stone of the Snow Goddess has probably left the Snow City. I will continue to investigate. If you have anything to do, report to the Ice God Tower immediately.Dragon Magician, please conduct a joint investigation. Whenever a strange ice magician appears, you must find out clearly and understand? \"\n\n\n\nThe Marquis and Long Zhi agreed. Under their care, the Ice and Snow Goddess Sacrifice walked out of the Ice and Snow City. The wide white robe sleeves danced lightly, and the light between the sky and the earth completely darkened, and the snowflakes turned around. The sacrificial goddess of ice and snow actually stepped on a piece of palm-sized snowflake and flew away. Its magical skill was so amazing that it couldn't help but stop.\n\n\n\nWatching the Ice and Snow Goddess Sacrifice leave, the Marquis couldn't help but give me a big sigh. He looked at Long Zhi and couldn't help but smile bitterly, \"Old Dragon, I'll be the East at noon, let's go to Qingfeng to eat. I know you like the lightness there. These days have made me feel bad, for fear that I will not serve this goddess Sacrifice!\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi smiled slightly and said, \"It should be that I asked the Marquis. Why am I not like this these days? Even the magic cultivation time has been shortened a lot. I think the wind-clearing bamboo wine should be able to shock us. Brother Xue told Brother Xue that this time, he will take out the bamboo wine that has been sunk for thirty years to taste it. Brother Xue, don't you be stingy.\" As he said, Long Zhi looked at a middle-aged man in white at a distance. The middle-aged man in white looked only about forty years old and looked very elegant, just like a Confucian scholar. The boss in gold was right beside him. At this time, he heard that the Marquis and the Chairman of the Magician Association chose Qingfeng, and his face looked a little dark.\n\n\n\nThe middle-aged man in white smiled helplessly and said, \"You just can't give me a try. Drink it, drink it, anyway, there will be nothing after you finish it. Brother Jin Hao, do you want to come and taste it together?\"\n\n\n\nThe boss of Dacheng Cheng said calmly, \"Thank you Brother Xueyu, but there are still many things in Dacheng Cheng waiting for me to deal with. Liao San is a new man again, so I won't go. I will come to the door to express my guilt.\"\n\n\n\nXue Yu smiled slightly, \"That's not hard to force you. Marquis, Lao Long, let's go. There are too many things happening these days, and our Qingfeng business has also been affected a lot by the lockdown.\"\n\n\n\nUnder Xue Yu's reminder, the Marquis patted his own head and said suddenly, \"Looking at my scrutiny, come on, immediately send me orders to lift the ban on the city lockdown. Let's go, I'll drink more today. These two naive things really make me tired and old, and my body is really not good. Lao Xue, today you want to let the King of Miao Jia cook himself. The green bamboo veil he made is the most suitable for my current taste.\"",

    "content": "There will be an update for the 12.o5 PM conference. Everyone is welcome to participate in the 12-year-old PM conference and read the new chapter. Maybe many book lovers are very interested in the Golden Fragrance Circle. Tomorrow I will open a chapter related to the work to explain it to everyone. Hehe, it is definitely something you can eat.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNian Bing came to the door of the water truck, holding some vegetables and meat in his left hand, and knocked on the door for a few minutes, \"Bird, are you?\"\n\n\n\nThe sound of his footsteps began to sound, and the door opened. The girl from Feng poked her head out of the door. When she saw that it was Nian Bing, she couldn't help but smiled slightly, and hurriedly opened the door and said, \"Come in, chef, can you think of me today?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"I thought about it a few days ago, but there were too many things and I didn't have time. I'm so embarrassed. Today I will definitely make you some good food.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl with bright eyes blinked and smiled and said, \"I'm joking with you. You're really good. If you have something to do, just be busy. I'm not sure what I eat. In fact, I don't want to eat what you cook. If I eat too much, I'll make my taste picky. What should I do when you leave?\" After saying the last word, she realized the linguistic disease in her words. Her pretty face couldn't help but turn slightly, and she quickly turned around and walked in with Nianbing. Looking at the perfect back of the girl, Nian Bing looked at her head. Regarding her appearance and figure, Xue Jing and Long Ling were a little worse than those of the girl, especially the noble and elegant temperament on the girl, which made people feel more favorable. In addition, her gentleness, such a perfect woman, if Nian Bing is not moved, she will definitely be cheating on herself. However, now he only treats the girl as a friend, and all his attention is focused on improving his own art and magic. Before the matter of the Ice God Tower was completed, he was actually distracted from thinking about other things. \n\n\n\nWhen he arrived in the yard, Nian Bing raised his head and looked at the sky, and smiled and said, \"I'll go to the kitchen to make a meal first, it'll be fine after a while.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl looked back and smiled, saying, \"Don't be so anxious. You should take a break first. Oh, by the way, don't make such nuisance today. I'm so embarrassed. You are a guest. I should have made it for you, but I'm so stupid that I won't do anything except cooking porridge.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at the smile of the girl, and couldn't help but feel a little confused, and murmured, \"Biang, you are so beautiful. Ah! I'm sorry, I'll go make a meal first.\" As he said, he hurried to the kitchen with something in hand.\n\n\n\nLooking at Nian Bing walking into the kitchen, a strange light appeared in the girl's eyes. She was not seeing her gentle expression. Instead, she seemed to be thinking about something and said to herself: \"Forget it, getting the Destiny Sword is enough to me. Why bother to worry about his Fire God Stone? For the sake of his meal, let's take advantage of him. I think the elders shouldn't blame me.This person named Nian Bing is really strange. He actually has so many treasures on his body. If he changes his elder sister, he may not have anything left. Forget it, don’t worry about him. Getting the stern knife is also a favor to Mr. Hua Tian. \"When he said this, the cold light in the girl's eyes disappeared, and her eyes turned to the kitchen again, revealing a confused look.\n\n\n\nThe meal was indeed much faster this time. The reason why Nian Bing chose the complicated and extreme dung meat last time was because of the lack of ingredients. This time he brought fresh vegetables and meat, which was naturally much simpler to operate. In two minutes, the entire water truck was filled with fragrance. The standard four dishes and one soup showed a completely different color. It was judged from the color and fragrance, which was already the best. Nian Bing put the vegetables on the table in the yard, wiped the sweat from the head, and shouted to the room with a smile, \"My daughter, you're eating. Come quickly.\"\n\n\n\n\"It smells so good! I don't have to drink porridge anymore.\" The faint fragrance of noodles was swollen, and the cherry girl quickly rushed to the table. Nian Bing only felt a flash in front of her eyes, and the chopsticks had fallen into her hands.\n\n\n\nThe girl from Feng pulled a stool and Nian Bing from the side, but her eyes didn't leave the table, \"Wow, are you making food? Why are you making something like crafts? I can't bear to eat it.\" Although she said this on her mouth, the chopsticks in her hand had already stretched out and directly tied to a plate of red and yellow dishes.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"If no one eats something a chef makes, he will be too bad. I don't want that. You will eat it all. Knowing that you have a large amount of food, I specially made more today. There will always be some left in these four dishes. You only need to heat it up at night, which is enough, and the taste should not change too much.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl raised a chopstick and put the gold and yellow unknown object into her mouth. She chewed it on her side. She clearly felt that the meat was very tender and smooth, and the gravy was filled with fragrance. She chewed it lightly for two seconds. Her lips were already filled with fragrance cloth, and the salty place couldn't help but open her appetite. Nian Bing passed a bowl of rice and smiled and said, \"This dish is a little salty, so it's suitable for you to eat.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl looked at Nian Bing and praised, \"It's great. I said that my taste will be tricked by you. It seems that it will become real. Why don't you eat it? What I just ate is this. What tender meat. Can't I think it's fish? But it doesn't have the fishy smell of fish!\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"I only came after eating. We have to start business at noon, so I ate it later in the morning and don't eat it. When I go back, I just can eat it in the afternoon, so I won't eat it here. The one you just ate just now is not fish, but a very ordinary dish called red gold frog. The red one is round-shaped pepper. What you just ate just now is frog meat. The frog meat is very tender and sweet in the mouth. It is one of the best products of meat. As long as you remove the fishy smell, everyone will be delicious. Eat quickly and eat more.\"\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, the girl of Feng would never eat less. She kept sucking something to her mouth and chatting with Nian Bing clearly. Her skills made Nian Bing very impressed.\n\n\n\n\"Nian Bing, you just said that you still have people in Ice and Snow City?\" said the girl ate.\n\n\n\nNian Bing slammed his head and said, \"No, I just found a job. You should know that place, it is the clear wind in the city, not far away.\"\n\n\n\n\"Qingfeng? The food there is so expensive! I haven't eaten it, but I heard it's pretty good. With your skills, it must be the best big restaurant there. Although I haven't eaten it, I can be sure that the chefs in Qingfeng are not as delicious as you do.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"You guessed it's wrong. I'm not a cook there. Apart from my teacher, you are the first person to eat my cooking. In the clear wind, I just chopped wood.\"\n\n\n\nWith a puff sound, the girl's mouthful of rice came out, and she coughed loudly, which made Nian Bing jump. Nian Bing hurriedly put a bowl of soup on her, patting her elastic back, and putting the soup into her red lips. He was anxious, and he couldn't see how hot he was at this time.\n\n\n\nAfter drinking a bowl of hot soup, the girl came over and gasped and said angrily, \"You want to kill me! It's not like this to joke.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing patted her back and smiled bitterly, \"Who is kidding you? I am just a chopping wood in the clear wind. Your ability to withstand is too poor, so be calm first.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl looked at Nian Bing in surprise, \"Are you really chopping firewood there? Are you not burning?\" As she said, she stretched out her slender and delicate little hand and touched Nian Bing's size. Her warm little hand was filled with a fragrance. Her smooth skin couldn't help but silence in her heart, grabbed her hand, and said, \"I'm fine, I'll choose.\" I don’t want to expose my cooking arts when I’m chopping firewood there. The chef Chang Miao Ke Wang Mingyuan, who is a chef in Qingfeng, has high skills. When I got there, I just wanted to see what special skills he has, so why bother revealing myself? If they knew my real cooking art, it would be difficult to leave.\"\n\n\n\nThe voice of the young woman suddenly dropped a lot, and she lowered her head and said, \"You, let me go first, what's the matter?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was shocked. Only then did he realize that because his right hand grabbed the girl's hand, his left hand had stopped slapping her back. At this time, he was folding on her waist. The girl's whole elastic thigh was completely folded into the trap by herself. Such a secret scene made him stunned. He hurriedly let go and helped the girl do it. Even if he was smart, he encountered such an embarrassing situation and didn't know what to say for a while. He slapped his mouth for a long time before he stuffed the chopsticks into the girl's hand, coughed twice, and looked at the big tree outside the yard wall.",

Hehe.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThe bird's action of eating was no longer as fast as before. Although she was still eating constantly, her mood was very complicated at this time, and the strangeness in her heart kept rising. Although she knew that she was not supposed to be like this, she couldn't control herself and often peeked at Nian Bing for a few times. She obviously ate more this rice than the last time. She only ate less than half of the rice, so she stopped chopsticks. Nian Bingwei was about to help her clean up, but she was stopped by the girl. The girl glanced at him and said calmly, \"I'll come here, you can sit in the meeting, I'll do it in one go.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing stood up, his mood was as complicated as ever. He clicked and said, \"Girl, then I'll leave first. I'll come to see you two days later.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl said with some disappointment: \"Are you leaving so soon?\"\n\n\n\nLooking at her resentful eyes, Nian Bing shouted that she couldn't bear it. She thought, if this continues, she might really fall into it, and it would be wonderful to walk quickly. Thinking of this, he no longer felt hesitant and said, \"I still have a lot of things to do when I go back. I can't take the other person's salary in vain! Don't be rushing to get your body tired, just do it slowly.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl ordered the head, put the leftovers into the kitchen, and sent Nianbing to the door, smiled slightly, and said, \"You'll come over when nothing happens. Thank you for your lunch.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's mind had recovered a little at this time, and she smiled and said, \"What are you thanking me? You should be thankful for you! Go back, you are a girl's house, keep your door closed. See you again.\" After saying that, he finally left the water truck in awkward manner, immersed his mind in the magic of the same origin of ice and fire, and then his mind calmed down.\n\n\n\nThe girl from the geek saw Nian Bing walking away and couldn't help but burst into laughter, \"This silly boy, a silly chef, actually gave him a chance to chop wood. He really thought about it. However, he was so stupid and cute. If I took him back, I wonder what the elders would think, his cooking art was indeed superb!\"\n\n\n\nAfter leaving the water truck, Nian Bing did not go back to Qingfeng directly. He had already passed the three-day schedule. He didn't know if the people in the Magicians Association would recognize him. No matter what, he had to go there first. As long as he could read it in their data room, he would use his memory to be enough, and he would not go there again in the future. At most one month, you will leave the Ice City and go to the next stop. Because of his hatred for the Ice God Tower, he didn't want to do anything for the Ice Moon Empire, even if it was just the Magicians Association of Ice Moon Empire. The blow when he was young made Nian Bing look weak and he was self-centered. He didn't want to do anything extra, except to improve his abilities and pursue martial arts in order to avenge his enemies.The Ice and Snow City finally lifted the ban, and the streets were in full swing. People who dared not leave because of the lockdown in the city these days were buying what they needed in various stores in the city, especially stores that consumed people's livelihood supplies, and were even more crowded at this time. Feeling the warm scenes on the street market, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel better, distinguishing the direction of the magicians' meeting and stride away. Although the weather was very hot, Nian Bing didn't feel the heat even though she walked along the way and was free and contented. \n\n\n\nIce and Snow City is indeed very big. Although Nian Bing walked very fast, it took more than a long time to come to the Magicians' Club again. The top-shaped building made the Magicians' Club so eye-catching. Because it was daytime, there were two guards wearing magic robes standing at the entrance of the Trade Union. The two of them were about sixteen or seventeen years old. Judging from the small sign on their magic robes that were not obvious, they were just two magicians, and at most they were only the power of a junior magician.\n\n\n\nWith a big stroll forward, Nian Bing walked to the door of the Magicians and sang to the two first-class magicians guarding the door, \"Hello, I'll find the Rizon Magic Commander.\"\n\n\n\nThe junior magician on the left glanced at Nian Bing and said in confusion: \"Are you looking for the Lizan Demonic Commander? What's the matter?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"That's the case. I came to the Trade Association for magic test three days ago. It was too late at that time, so the Lizan Demonic Instructor asked me to come to him the next day. But the entire Ice and Snow City was sealed the next day, so I didn't come. So, the lockdown has ended today, so I came immediately. I'm really embarrassed to let the Lizan Demonic Instructor wait for a long time.\"\n\n\n\nThe eyes of the two young junior magicians showed surprise in their eyes, and they said to the right: \"You, are you the big magician who is younger than Sister Long?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned and said, \"Do you know me too? That day, the demon steward said that I already have the power of a great magician.\"\n\n\n\nThe junior magician on the left looked at Nian Bing with some strangeness and said, \"We have been looking for you in the city these two days, but we can't find you. You finally come, come in with me.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing felt a sudden change in his heart and thought to himself that even if his magic power is not weak, the chairman of the trade association will not need to ask him to order him to find him. There may be some confusion in this, so be careful. As he thought about it, he entered the Magicians' Association with the first-class magician for the second time. As he walked, he secretly calculated the solutions to various situations.\n\n\n\nThe junior magician brought Nian Bing to a room in the trade association, poured him a glass of water, and said, \"You wait here first, I'll inform the Lizan Demonic.\"\n\n\n\nThe room is very large and seems to be specially used to receive guests. There are wall paintings similar to the last test hall on the wall. Even on the table in front of you, there are patterns of hexagrams.As time went by, his feet rose again, and the water-type demon steward Lizhan walked in from outside. As soon as he entered the door, Nian Bington felt a strong pressure covering him. He turned his head and saw that Lizhan's gaze was a bit strange, and he was standing there looking at him.\n\n\n\n\"Hello, Lizhang Demonic Commander.\" Nian Bing quickly stood up and respectfully went to Lizhang.\n\n\n\nLi Wang said calmly, \"Hello, I have been waiting for you for three days. The lockdown is only for the outside. For the city, there is no too strong lockdown, so it should not affect your actions.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said without saying a voice: \"I just arrived in Ice and Snow City, and the sudden lockdown made me a little scared, so I waited until the lockdown was over before I arrived here. I was really embarrassed.\"\n\n\n\nLi Jun said with a eyebrows: \"Scared? As a magician with strong mental power, this kind of negative emotion may not be easy to appear.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's face showed a faint red color and said, \"I came from a small place and never saw such a big battle. I really lost my face.\"\n\n\n\nLi Yang's eyes were always looking at Nian Bing, and his mental power was always covering Nian Bing's body, but no matter how he looked, he could not see a broken hole from Nian Bing. He smiled indifferently and said, \"Since that's the case, come with me. From now on, you are already a member of the Magicians Association of the Ice Moon Empire. Let's go, the ceremony is ready.\" After speaking, he turned around and walked out.\n\n\n\nNian Bing hurriedly followed the Lizhu and walked behind him. The word \"dark\" condensed his own power of ice and fire. Once something happened, although the other party was a magician, if he stole the siege with two extreme magic at the same time, he would definitely be busy for a while, and then he would have the chance to escape. As he walked, he was also secretly wondering why the demon steward here wanted to try him? Could it be that the matter of killing Liao San was exposed? Liao San is just a shopkeeper of Dacheng, so he doesn't need a devilish demon in charge.\n\n\n\nWith doubt in his heart, Nian Bing and Suli Yang walked into the main hall of the Magician Association. The entire hall is unusually wide, more than twice as big as the test hall at the beginning. There are several people standing there talking. The magician has different marks on his chest from low to high. There is only one small mark on his chest of the first-class magician. For example, the wind system is a group of small green whirlwinds, and the fire system is a group of red flames. Since the magician's magic robe is different in color according to the magic he uses, the color is also different, so this kind of small mark is difficult to distinguish. When you reach the level of intermediate magician realm, there will be an extra silver-colored squid around the original small mark, and the high-level magician will have another circle of squids. When you reach the level of the great magician realm, there will be three squids around the mark that symbolizes identity. After entering the high-level stage of the Magician Master, the squid will be larger and will turn golden at the same time. Regardless of which series of magicians, the squids are all golden. At this point, the squids of the five empires on the mainland are all standard.The magicians are almost the limit among magicians. The mark on their chests will return to their original color, but there will be an extra six-pointed star, just like Long Zhi, the president of the Magicians Association of the Ice Moon Empire.\n\n\n\nThere are five magicians chatting in the hall, two of which look similar to Li Yang last year, and they are all the same as Li Yang. The other three are also the magazines of the great magicians. They are obviously all the elites in the magicians' association. Seeing Li Yang walking in with Nian Bing, their eyes couldn't help but fall on them. One of the fire magicians with the magicians logo on their chest smiled and said, \"Li Yang, is this the newcomer you tested that day? It's really impossible to see from the surface!\"",

    "content": "Seeing such high-level magicians, the first thing Nian Bing did was to carefully hide his magical power of ice and fire, especially the aura of fire-type magical power. If you don’t say that you escape, you may be ruthlessly attacked if you get a little bit of aggression. Hearing the fire demon instructor, he hurried forward and said respectfully, \"Nian Bing has seen several fronts.\"\n\n\n\nThe Fire Demonic who spoke before was very cheerful, laughed and said, \"Don't call me the front, so I have no first and last, and the master is the priest. Just like you are at this age, I just entered the realm of the middle-level magician. At that time, it was already very fast. You are welcome to join our Ice Moon Empire Magician Association.\"\n\n\n\nAt this time, the three great magicians had retreated to the side because of their low status. In front of the demons, the great magicians had no choice but to surrender.\n\n\n\nThe other demon coach's chest was marked with a golden ice flower. It was obvious that he was an ice-type demon coach. He was not as good as a fire-type demon coach. He snorted coldly and his whole body was filled with a cold breath.\n\n\n\nLizhang walked to the two demonic mentors and turned to Nian Bing and said, \"The trade association stipulates that if a new member joins the trade association, at least one senior master in the realm of the demonic mentor should perform the ritual. If the joiner only has the power below the intermediate magician, the great magician can perform the ritual for him. And Your strength has reached the realm of a great magician, so today I asked two other trade presidents to come together to perform the ceremony for you. Unfortunately, the president went out to do the work, otherwise it would be more appropriate for him to perform it for you. Please step forward and stand in the center of the six-pointed star.\" Li Wang pointed to the ground.\n\n\n\nNian Bing answered a voice and walked to the center of the three demons, standing in the center of the golden six-pointed star, a faint smile appeared on his face, and said, \"I, the water-based demon, Rika. As the elder of the magician, the Ice Moon Empire, I performed this ritual. The great god of elements, under your witness, Nian Bing will become a great magician of this trade association. Everything is proud of the honor and glory of the trade association, and will dedicate the strength of the trade association for its lifetime. Nian Bing, I ask you, do you want to give everything for the trade association?\"\n\n\n\n\"I do it.\" Nian Bing replied without hesitation. What is the space-wide meaning of everything, but the binding force is extremely strong. Joining this magician association is not like entering a huge prison? Although Nian Bing answered, she added two words in her heart, and it was all together, - I'm willing to do anything.\n\n\n\nLi Yang smiled slightly and pointed at a great magician beside him. The magic robe was very strange, silver-colored. He stepped forward and murmured a few spells. When the silver light flashed, a light blue magic robe appeared in his hand. It was a magic robe symbolizing the identity of an ice-type magician. Although the ice-type and the water-type system have the same origin, the color of the ice-type magic robe is slightly cleaner than that of the water-type system. Seeing the appearance of the magic robe, Nian Bing thought to himself, is this the so-called space magic?In the world of magic, the four elemental magics of water, fire, earth and wind are based on them, and then special magics such as ice and thunder are derived. Space magic, light magic and dark magic are very rare. Usually, the most common ones appear in the mainland are space magic. As for light and darkness, in the past, these two magics seem to have been lost. However, when Rongtian was a child, he told Nian Bing that in fact, those two magics have not been lost, but only some people with special bodies can master them. From an energy perspective, although light and darkness are not much better than other magics, they have their own special characteristics and are much more difficult to deal with. The great magician of the space system will have the opportunity to ask more questions in the future. It would be great if you could also use space system magicians. I heard that this kind of space system magician can save your own things with a special space magic, which is very convenient to use. If you have that kind of magic, you don’t have to carry so much stuff on your body. You can even buy more materials and put them on your body for use. \n\n\n\nOf course, it was impossible for Lizhang to know that Nian Bing was thinking of using space magic to adjust the materials. He took the magic robe from the space magician, walked to Nian Bing, and said, \"The God of Elements will bless you, child, put on this magic robe, and you will become a part of this troupe. We are your friends and friends.\"\n\n\n\nLooking at Li Yang's folded gaze, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a little confused. However, he had not been confused for too long. He took the magic robe in Li Yang's hand and put it on himself. The size was just right, and it was obviously customized according to his figure. The blue magic robe feels very good, and it is clearly made of special materials. The entire magic robe is filled with a faint magical atmosphere. Although it is not strong, it is still good for one's absorption of ice elements. The robe has a moon symbol pricked with silver threads on the underwear. The moon's bottom is a white ice flower, which is the logo of the Ice Moon Empire.\n\n\n\nLooking at the three silver lines around the ice flowers on his chest, Nian Bing secretly shouted in his heart, Dad, mother, did you see it? Your son is now a great magician, a big magician in both systems! You wait, it won’t take too long, I will definitely go to the Ice God Tower again.\n\n\n\nLi Yang looked at Nian Bing wearing the magic robe of the ice-type magician, and couldn't help but secretly complain in his heart. Nian Bing, who was already handsome, looked even more handsome under the support of Hua's expensive magic robe, with starry eyes and bright eyes, giving people a favor. He smiled slightly and said, \"It turns out that people want to wear clothes and put on magic robe. You are already a real magician of the Ice Moon Empire.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing respectfully presented to the three demons, \"I thank you for your help.\"\n\n\n\nLizhang once again pointed the magician in the space. The silver light flashed. This time, there was an exquisite magic wand and a silver-colored badge. The badge also had the symbol of the Ice Moon Empire. In the center of the silver-colored ice flowers, a transparent gem was embedded with a slight magic wave. The magic wand was only more than a foot short, and the body was blue. The head of the wand was a milky white gem, scattering a faint frost fog. Although it was far inferior to the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess Stone, it was also a rare top-grade gem. \n\n\n\nLizhang first sent the six-edge badge to memorize Bing, \"This is the symbol of our magician in the Ice Moon Empire. As your great magician, as the leader of the army, you can use this badge to send any army of less than a thousand men to fight for you in any army that is not part of the nine cities of the Ice Moon Empire. At the same time, with this badge, you can also use this badge to fight in this craftsmanship. Payments are collected in any club. The salary varies depending on the level. You can get twenty purple gold coins every month for your current level. It is impossible to fake if there are special marks left by this trade fair on the badge, so you must keep it. If you lose it, you will immediately report it to the general. We will cancel the function of this badge based on the record number on the badge.\"\n\n\n\nTwenty purple gold coins are two hundred gold coins! Plus the rights brought by the badge, this is definitely a treasure! It seems that under the final duty, he also has the power of the final. No wonder his father once said that joining a magician is something that ordinary magicians dream of. With this, it will be much more convenient to travel in the mainland in the future. After thanking the Lip, carefully put the badge into the lid.\n\n\n\nAt this time, Li Yang took the magic wand and smiled, \"This magic wand is called Bingling. Originally, with your cultivation, the commerce should not give you such a precious wand, but I discussed with the president. The president saw that you are the youngest magician and have an endless future, so I took this script in advance. You should reward the staff of the Ice Magician, a magician of the Magician. With it, you can increase the rhythm by one third while chanting spells. At the same time, when condensing magic power, the Ice will listen to your guidance more. You have to hold it away. This is already a magic item of gold-level. \"\n\n\n\n\"Golden artifact? Lizan Demonic Instructor, what does gold artifact mean?\" Nian Bing asked the doubt in his heart. He didn't know how the level of magic items was divided.",

    "content": "里鎝微微一笑，道：「看來，你接觸魔法的時間雖然不短，但對魔法還並不是真正的了解，在所有的魔法物品中，金器已經是相當高的等級了。魔法物品分為神器、次神器、暗金器、金器、銀器、青銅器一共六個檔次，雖然金器級別只在第四，但要知道，單是一柄金器法杖，在市面上也價值過千紫金幣，而暗金器的魔法物品已經極為稀有，最高的神器和次神器，是非常難得到的，就連會長，也只有一件次神器級別的法杖而已，真正的神器，據聽說，只有冰神塔的冰雪女神祭祀手上有一件，但具體是什麼就不知道了，好象不是法杖。」\n\n念冰看著手中的冰凌杖，心中微動，如果這樣來算，那自己的晨露刀當做法杖用時，算是什麼級別呢？恐怕至少也應該是暗金器級的寶貝吧。畢竟，冰雪女神之石明顯要比這法杖上的冰凌石強的多了。\n\n「多謝各位魔導士和會長的栽培，我一定會努力修煉，爭取早日成為更強大的魔法師。」說著萬金油式的話，念冰的心卻已經飛到魔法師工會的圖書館去了，現在已經得到了這些，只需要在記牢自己所需要的冰系魔法咒語就足夠了。\n\n里鎝微微一笑，道：「該給你的都已經給你了，儀式也已經完成，現在，我要跟你說說本工會中的一些規定，以免你今後行差踏錯。最主要的幾條你一定要牢記。首先，作為冰月帝國魔法師工會的一名魔法師，不論什麼時候，都必須要無條件的服從工會的調遣，一旦工會出現危機，你將成為魔法師軍團中的一員，至於具體職位，要看你當時的魔法等級而定，這一點是必須要遵守的，否則，不但你的魔法師等級將被取消，還會受到工會嚴厲的處罰。」\n\n念冰點了點頭，既然得到了那麼多權利，有義務也是必然的是。\n\n里鎝繼續道：「其次，當冰月帝國遇到危機時，我們作為冰月帝國的魔法師工會，有義務幫助冰月帝國對抗外敵，在這種情況下，你也必須無條件的接受徵調，成為帝國魔法師軍團的一名魔法師，當然，在這種情況下，帝國會另外付出酬勞的，而酬勞的數字將極為可觀，如果立了功勞，還會另有獎賞。」\n\n聽完這句話，念冰心中疑惑大升，既然是冰月帝國的魔法師工會，不應該以帝國的權益為第一優先麼？為什麼在規定中，第一條反到是要無條件聽從魔法師工會的調遣，從這個意義上來理解，感覺上十分怪異，難道魔法師工會在自己的利益受到侵害時還能與帝國作對不成？\n\n里鎝繼續道：「第三，成為工會中的一名魔法師後，如果工會需要你擔任什麼職務，你也必須遵行，聽候工會的調遣。當然，以你現在的情況，工會是不可能給你安排什麼職務的，你現在最重要的，就是努力提升自己的魔法修為，爭取早日達到魔導士境界，一旦成為了魔導士，你將在工會中擁有很大的話語權，並被授予工會長老的榮譽。」\n\n念冰收斂心神，點了點頭，道：「我一定會遵守工會的命令。還有其他的麼？」\n\n里鎝淡然道：「這三條是最重要的，至於其他一些小條款就無所謂了。等你到了魔導士境界後，工會自然會給你更多的權利，當然，也會讓你了解工會中更多的事務。現在來看，整個大陸上，五大帝國都有自己的魔法師工會，而我們冰月帝國由於有冰神塔的存在，一直被認為是五大帝國中魔法實力最強大的。但是，他們卻並不知道，我們魔法師工會與帝國象徵冰神塔並不是同一領域的魔法師，冰神塔中雖然有冰系魔法師數百名，但是他們卻只聽從冰雪女神祭祀的調遣，如果不計算他們，在五大帝國中，反到是我們冰月帝國魔法師工會的實力最弱。工會中一共有魔導師一名，魔導士級別的長老八名，大魔法師算上你一共是三十九名，其餘低級魔法師合起來也不過剛剛過千而已。整體實力比冰神塔差了許多。而其他四大帝國，都至少有兩名魔導師，尤其是華融帝國，更是有三名火系魔導師之多，據說，其中年紀最大的一名火系魔導師，華融帝國的融親王，實力已經極為接近神降師的地步了。所以，為了使我們冰月帝國魔法師工會不至於淪落，你必須要更努力的修煉，實力越強大，對於工會，乃至於整個帝國都是最有利的，你明白麼？」\n\n當念冰聽到融親王三字時，臉上的肌肉不禁抽搐了一下，他怎麼會不知道華融帝國的魔法師工會強大呢？他的家鄉就是那裡啊！當初，如果不是融親王派遣大量魔法師追殺，他和父親也不至於在整片大陸上像喪家之犬一般奔逃了，引得父親最後痛下決心，到冰神塔去營救母親，但父親卻也深陷其中。華融帝國、融親王，這都是念冰心中最深的痛。\n\n「念冰，你在想什麼？你沒事吧。」里鎝有些不滿的呼喚著。\n\n念冰回過神來，趕忙道：「啊！對不起，我是在想，如果有一天我們冰月帝國魔法師工會也能達到華融帝國魔法師工會那種程度，恐怕在冰月帝國中的地位也一定不會比冰神塔差什麼吧。」\n\n里鎝嘆息一聲，道：「這只是一個願望而已，真的要實現又談何容易呢？培養一名優秀的魔法師是需要大量時間的，而真正的天才有少的可憐，現在，願意修煉魔法的人越來越少了，武技相比魔法更容易上手的多，除了在大規模殺傷性和遠距離攻擊上不如以外，武技確實沒有什麼比魔法明顯弱的地方，我真懷疑，幾百年後，魔法這種古老的修煉方法是否還會繼續存在於大陸上。」\n\n一旁的冰系魔導士眉頭微皺，沉聲道：「里鎝，你的話太多了，儀式既然已經結束，就這樣吧。」\n\n里鎝這才醒悟過來，趕忙道：「哦，對，我真是老糊塗了。念冰，儀式到這裡完全結束，兩位，你們可以去冥想了，念冰，我聽師九和靈兒說，你希望能多學習一些冰系魔法咒語，你跟我來吧，我帶你到總工會的圖書館，那裡有你需要的東西。」\n\n一聽這話，念冰不禁心中大喜，他最想要的就是這些啊！趕忙答應一聲，跟著里鎝離開了這舉行儀式的大殿。當他經過那名冰系魔導士身邊的時候，耳邊突然響起一個微弱的聲音，「小子，等一切結束後，你到我的房間來找我，我住在工會宿舍中最西面的房間中，記住，一定要來，明白麼？」\n\n念冰心中一動，這時候他當然不能回答，只是默默的在里鎝背後點了點頭，就跟著他走了出去。冰系魔導士明明是自己第一次見到的，他為什麼要單獨見自己呢？難道有什麼目的不成？算了，現在自己也已經是冰月帝國魔法師工會中的一員，相信他也不敢亂來，先到圖書館中學些對自己有用的東西再說。\n\n在里鎝的帶領下，念冰跟著他繞過了先前儀式大廳所在的高大建築，向魔法師工會的後面走去，這裡確實很大，後面別有洞天，一座接一座的高大建築緊密相連，雖然看上去建築很宏偉，但不知為什麼，卻給人一種壓抑的感覺。",

    "content": "As he walked, Li Yang said to Nian Bing, \"I will arrange a dormitory for you later, and you can stay here. This is the right only for magicians above the level of the great magician.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's heart sank and said, \"Lizan Demonic Instructor, can I go outside?\"\n\n\n\nLi Yang smiled slightly and said, \"Of course it's OK. In the trade fair, unless there is a special order, no one will restrict your freedom. You can enter and exit freely or go out for a trip. The room I mean is a permanent room arranged for you. You can live here any time you come back. . However, I suggest you to practice more and improve your magic power as soon as possible. I am looking forward to it now. I want to see when you can break through to the realm of a demon steward. Come on, the library has arrived. \"He walked into a small building next to him that looked inconspicuous.\n\n\n\nThe small building is very clean and seems to have four layers when looking outside, but each layer is not very tall, so it is inconspicuous from outside. The inner pen smiled slightly and said, \"That's it. There are four layers in this library, and many of the data in it are already isolated on the mainland. Therefore, you can read it here, but you will definitely not be able to take away any data, especially the third and fourth levels. Oh, by the way, you still I can't get into the fourth level. I'll introduce you to the library. According to the level of magicians, the information stored in each level here is also different. For example, the first level is more suitable for reading by elementary and intermediate magicians, while the second level is suitable for reading by advanced and great magicians, and the third level requires the power of a magician to enter. As for the highest level, although it is the smallest, it is I have recorded many lost high-level magic. Only by reaching the level of a magic guide can you enter and read it. At the same time, you also need to have the consent of the president. Although the president has never seen you, he has a very deep impression of you. He deliberately slandered me. Since your magic control is approaching the level of a magic guide, you can go to the third level to read magic books. In this way, you can learn more things, even if you If you go out for practice in the future, you won’t be able to influence your strength because of the lack of spells. Okay, you can read it here yourself. The president may have come back after a meeting. At that time, he should have talked to you. If you don’t understand anything in the reading here, you can also ask me or the ice magician Varon, the previous ice magician, who has a more advanced level of magic than me, and is the fourth oldest in the trade association. \" \n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at the rows of bookshelfs on both sides and couldn't help but feel excited. For a magician, this was definitely a treasure. The books here were of course not just as simple as magical spells, but just those records about magic and the notes left by magicians in the past were already precious. \"Teacher Lizhan, I am so grateful to you. Can I call you so much?\"\n\n\n\nLi Yang smiled slightly and said, \"Of course.Watching you young people grow older, I really feel that I am getting older. Now I just hope that when I die, I can see that our magicians in the Ice Moon Empire will become stronger, and all of this must be placed on your younger generation. There is a chance that you can communicate with Ling Er. She is like you and is also a great ice magician. Although she is worse than you in terms of magic power and control, she is very smart and often has some unique insights in magic. If you can communicate frequently, it will be a good thing for anyone. \"\n\n\n\nNian Bing clicked his head and said, \"I understand. Thank you, Teacher Lizang.\"\n\n\n\nLi Wang said lightly, \"You know the city lockdown in these few days, but you probably don't know the reason. I can see that you are a good and honest child. When you come back, you will have some questions about you. You just need to answer it.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's heart was moved and said, \"Mr. Li Wang, what happened? I'm really surprised. OK, the city was locked down. This should be no good for Ice and Snow City. It's just that those merchants who come from afar cannot enter the city. It's a big problem.\"\n\n\n\nLi Wang said lightly, \"That's not an option. Who gives people more power?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingzhui asked, \"What happened? Can you tell me?\"\n\n\n\nLizhang glanced at Nian Bing and said, \"Okay, this is not a huge secret. A few days ago, the city was closed because a big man came to the Snow City. She came to track down the whereabouts of an item. The item was said to be very precious and a magic item. I am afraid it has magic power close to the level of artifacts. I heard that it seems to be called the Stone of the Snow Goddess.\"\n\n\n\nEven though Nian Bing's mind was stable, he could not help but be surprised and his face changed drastically when he heard the six words \"Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess\". Fortunately, he was behind Li Wang at this time, and Li Wang did not see his expression.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's heartbeat obviously accelerated, and he tried to ask, \"Stone of the Ice Goddess? Then, the person coming here should be from the Ice God Tower. What kind of stone must be something in the Ice God Tower?\"\n\n\n\nLi Wang turned over and looked at Nian Bing. At this time, Nian Bing had recovered his divine state. Apart from the surprise he had put on his face, he could not see anything, \"Yes, it is something in the Ice God Tower. The reason why it is said to be precious is precisely because this time, it is the symbol of our Ice Moon Empire, the master, the Ice and Snow Goddess, sacrifices to the Lord.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingxin was shocked. He had seen the Ice and Snow Goddess sacrifice once when he was ten years old. He remembered very clearly that with the power of the father's fire-based demon in front of the Ice and Snow Goddess sacrifice, he was like a child in front of the Ice and Snow Goddess sacrifice, and he had no ability to resist. If it weren't for his mother's desperate attempt to save him, he would have probably died in the first attack of the Ice and Snow Goddess sacrifice.At this time, he heard the most painful name in his heart again. His heart was trembling. At this time, he finally understood that the ring in the Ice and Snow City was actually caused by himself. However, how did the Ice and Snow Goddess sacrifice realize that the Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess is in the Ice and Snow City? Could it be that when I was using the Morning Dew Sword, I released the breath of the Snow Goddess Stone, which led her to the point? Yes, it must be like that. \n\n\n\nAfter figuring out these, Nian Bing's back could not help but be soaked in sweat. If he accidentally used the Morning Dew Sword during the three days of the city lockdown, he might have fallen into the hands of the Ice and Snow Goddess Priest at this time. It seems that what I need is still low-key! Before the magic is perfect, you must not let that woman truly realize her existence.\n\n\n\nLi Yang looked at Nian Bing who was trapped in thought, smiled slightly, and said, \"Everything has passed, you don't need to think too much. I think with the power of the Ice and Snow Goddess to worship the Lord, as long as that thing still exists, it is not difficult to take it back. Okay, you can read the book here and wait for the meeting to take it back. Well, I'll go back first. Nian Bing, you have to remember that as a magician, you can better improve your strength only by meditating for no time. I have already opened the restrictions on the first three levels of the library. Don't try to enter the fourth level, otherwise, the magic trap there can easily kill you.\"\n\n\n\nLi Wang left, and only Nian Bing was left in the Great Library. Nian Bing was not in a hurry to find what he needed. Standing there, he kept pondering, trying to clear the thoughts in his brain. The appearance of the Ice and Snow Goddess Sacrifice made him feel awkward. He only wanted to do one thing now, which was to leave the Ice and Snow City immediately. Since the Ice and Snow Goddess Sacrifice had noticed this, maybe she would be so happy to see her again, at that time, would she still be so happy?\n\n\n\nNian Bing is not afraid of the sacrifice of the Ice and Snow Goddess. Even if he fights head-on, he dares to make moves against the Ice and Snow Goddess. However, he is a rational person. He knows that if he does that, he will only be sacrificed in vain. Therefore, he told himself that he must be calm. Only rationality can make oneself realize the dream in his heart. Leaving here? It seems that this is my best choice, but now the Yang Yang Knife has not been completed and I can't leave. There is still a month, and I hope that there will be no need to have anything in this month. \n\n\n\nAt this moment, Nian Bing had already decided his direction for the next month and carefully inserted the morning dew knife into the storm. He decided that before leaving the Ice and Snow City, he would never use his knife anymore. At the same time, it was also the silence of the Ice and Snow Goddess.\n\n\n\nAfter thinking through all this, Nian Bing's mood has improved a lot. Since the lockdown has ended, it is confirmed that the Ice and Snow Goddess sacrifice has left. As long as you are careful, it will not be difficult to pay this month. Thinking of this, a cold smile appeared on his face. Just on the first level, find what you need.When Nian Bing started learning magic, he was already wandering around the mainland with his father. Although his father's knowledge was so beautiful, he was still young at that time, and except for some important things, the reality of his ability to remember was limited. He knew that what he needed most now was theoretical knowledge. Only by laying a good foundation can he learn better and become stronger faster. So, he did not rush to step onto the third level, but started from the first level. First, he picked up a book called \"Detailed Explanation of Magic Theory\".",

    "content": "The afternoon update is here. Please vote and add to your collections.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTime always passes quickly when one is reading. The library had many windows, letting in the light from outside. Nian Bing leaned against a bookshelf, continuously reading things that interested him. Although the books on the first floor were for the most elementary magicians, he felt as if he had discovered a treasure. Previously, some incomprehensible situations that he had experienced were now being answered one by one in the books. When Zha Ji had first begun to teach him the culinary arts, he had taught him that no matter what you study, the foundation is the most important part. This was a principle Nian Bing had come to understand deeply during his later culinary studies.\n\nThe sky outside gradually darkened. The magical lamps in the library lit up automatically. Their power source was nothing more than the lowest-grade magic stones. Nian Bing had no intention of leaving. Aided by the bright light source, he began to read his fourth book of the day.\n\nJust then, the library door suddenly made a sound. Although Nian Bing was engrossed in his reading, he was highly alert. He subconsciously looked up toward the main entrance. The person who appeared there was not the President of the Magician's Guild as he had imagined, but someone he knew: the Ice Grand Mage—Long Ling. She was also the Guild President's only daughter.\n\n\"It's you?\" Nian Bing looked at Long Ling, a little surprised. He smiled slightly and greeted her. Long Ling looked at him with equal surprise and said, \"What are you doing here? With your level of magical cultivation, you shouldn't need to read the books on this first floor.\" As she spoke, she turned and closed the door. She was also wearing a light blue ice-magic robe. She looked gently at Nian Bing, a hint of a smile in her eyes. Although Nian Bing's gaze was on her, because he had been reading for so long, his eyes still held a look of intense focus. Paired with his already handsome face, it suddenly stirred a strange feeling in Long Ling's heart.\n\nNian Bing stood up, holding up the *Basic Theory of Ice Magic* in his hand, and smiled. \"What can I do? My foundation in magic was weak to begin with. It’s good to study the basics more. The spells can wait.\"\n\nLong Ling walked to Nian Bing's side, and the faint, fresh scent from her couldn't help but refresh his spirit. Long Ling was not short either, only slightly less so compared to Xue Jing. Looking up at Nian Bing, she said, \"You're really studious. I heard from Uncle Lita that you haven't left since you arrived at noon. It's already dinnertime. Come on, let's go eat. You can read more tomorrow. There are so many books here, you can't finish them in a day or two. You have plenty of time. Aren't you hungry?\"\n\nAt the mention of hunger, Nian Bing realized he really was a bit hungry. After eating in the morning, he hadn't had anything since. He carefully returned the book to its place. \"Then let's go, Miss Long Ling. Has the President returned?\" he asked tentatively.\n\nLong Ling glanced at him and said, \"Why are you always so formal? Now that you've joined the Guild, we're family. Just call me Ling'er. Hearing 'Miss, Miss' all the time sounds so awkward. When I get the chance, I'll need to ask for your guidance on magic control. I feel like I practice hard enough, but my control is still far behind yours!\"\n\nNian Bing had a very good impression of Long Ling. No matter when, her voice was always soft and gentle, very pleasant to the ear. \"Alright, Ling'er. You can lead the way, then. This place is really huge.\"\n\nThe two left the library, with Long Ling leading Nian Bing toward the north side. As they walked, she said to him, \"Dad came back a long time ago. He just drank too much at noon with Lord Marquis and Uncle Xue. He fell asleep the moment he got back and only woke up a little while ago. When he heard you had arrived, he sent me to get you. Alcohol really causes trouble. Nian Bing, do you drink?\"\n\nAlcohol? Hearing this word, a familiar feeling suddenly arose in Nian Bing's heart. Of course he could drink; he could even brew wine. As a chef, the Demon Chef had taught him everything related to eating and drinking. \"I can drink a little, but I rarely drink usually.\" In the Peach Blossom Forest, he was always the one drinking with Zha Ji. Zha Ji had a high tolerance for alcohol, so under his duress, Nian Bing's own tolerance had also become quite good. However, to ensure he maintained a keen sense of taste, Zha Ji only let him drink once every month or two. Therefore, Nian Bing didn't have any addiction to alcohol.\n\nLong Ling smiled. \"It's better to drink less. Alcohol isn't a good thing; drinking too much can easily lead to trouble.\" Being with Long Ling, Nian Bing felt very relaxed. After a bit of small talk, they arrived at a spire-topped building not far from the library. Long Ling led Nian Bing directly to the second floor. \"We usually eat here. Besides me, Dad only has one other disciple, Senior Brother Shi Jiu, whom you met last time. The other magicians mostly dine in their own rooms. Let's eat first. After we eat, I'll take you to your quarters. That way, it'll be convenient whether you want to stay here or go out in the future.\"\n\nThe two entered a room on the left side of the second floor. As soon as he walked in, Nian Bing saw Shi Jiu. Shi Jiu frowned slightly upon seeing Nian Bing. Seated above him was a man dressed in an azure magic robe, appearing to be in his forties or fifties. From the insignia on the chest of his robe, one could easily recognize him as the only Magic Mentor in the Ice Moon Empire's Magician's Guild, who was also the Guild President.\n\nNian Bing looked at Long Zhi, and Long Zhi was sizing him up at the same time. Looking at Nian Bing's handsome face and sensing his restrained aura, Long Zhi couldn't help but nod inwardly. He was a good judge of character and could tell just from appearances that Nian Bing was much stronger than his own disciple. Although he was younger than his daughter, his aura was clearly calm and steady. Coupled with the fact that he was the youngest Grand Mage, Long Zhi couldn't help but feel a favorable impression.\n\nNian Bing walked to the table and respectfully bowed to Long Zhi, saying, \"Nian Bing greets the President.\"\n\nLong Zhi pointed to the seat next to him and said, \"Please, sit. Welcome to the Guild.\" His tone was placid, yet it brought an invisible pressure upon Nian Bing. Nian Bing's mind had now completely withdrawn from the mode of absorbing knowledge. Though his exterior was humble and respectful, he was inwardly on high alert. He walked over and sat down next to Long Zhi, doing his best to remain composed.\n\nLong Ling didn't sit next to Shi Jiu, but instead sat down beside Nian Bing and smiled. \"Dad, I'm hungry. Let's eat.\" The round table was already laden with dishes, their aroma filling the air.\n\nLong Zhi smiled. \"Everyone's here now. Come, Nian Bing, you should eat more. From now on, feel free to join us for meals whenever you're free.\" As he spoke, he was the first to pick up his chopsticks.\n\nShi Jiu shot a glance at Nian Bing, a vicious glint flashing in his eyes. Although it was fleeting, the ever-watchful Nian Bing still noticed it. His heart stirred, and he subconsciously glanced at Long Ling beside him. Clever as he was, how could he not understand Shi Jiu's meaning?\n\nLong Zhi didn't eat much. His focus remained locked on Nian Bing. Seeing him glance at his daughter, he couldn't help but smile. \"Nian Bing, you and Ling'er are both ice mages. You should spar with each other more in the future to improve together. Where are you from? How long have you been practicing magic?\"\n\nNian Bing thought to himself, *Here it comes.* He quickly put down his chopsticks and said respectfully, \"I am from the Hua Rong Empire, but I left there with my parents when I was young. I've been practicing magic for about ten years, I suppose. However, I've never had a wise master to guide me; I've just been fumbling along on my own. I must seem laughable to you.\"\n\nLong Zhi smiled faintly. \"If one could reach your level just by fumbling around, then we old-timers should indeed retire. Magus Lita rarely praises anyone, yet he spoke very highly of you. Since you've already joined the Guild, there's no need to be so reserved. We're all family now. If you have any questions, you can ask any of the elders in the Guild, or you can come directly to me.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Long Zhi, his thoughts racing. *As expected of the President of the Magician's Guild,* he thought, *his edge is completely concealed.* Compared to him, Shi Jiu was nothing but a tiny insect. \"Thank you, President. I spent the entire afternoon in the library. It truly is an ocean of magic. I believe the knowledge there alone will be enough to keep me studying for a very long time. I will certainly come to you for guidance if there is anything I don't understand.\"\n\nLong Zhi gestured to the food on the table. \"Don't just talk. Eat some more.\"\n\nMaintaining his vigilance, Nian Bing couldn't taste the food at all. Long Zhi only asked some seemingly insignificant questions, but Nian Bing knew very well that the slightest wrong answer would immediately lead to big trouble. Both Shi Jiu and Long Ling cast their gazes on him from time to time. Long Ling's eyes were mostly filled with curiosity, while Shi Jiu's were a mixture of jealousy and resentment.\n\n\"Nian Bing, where were you during the city lockdown these past few days?\" Long Zhi asked the crucial question.",

I have never seen any world or what happened. I have a friend who lives in the city. She opened a steel carton, and I lived there for a few days.\"\n\n\n\n\"Iron weapon? I know most of the good weapons shops in the city. Which one is it?\" Long Zhizi asked without hesitation. Although his language was dull, his light was revealed.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"You definitely don't know about her. It is a very small ironware factory called a water-carrying ironware factory. There are few customers at ordinary times. Their industry competition is also very fierce and it is difficult to live.\"\n\n\n\n\"Water wire mesh?\" After hearing this name, Long Ling couldn't help but burst out laughing, and laughed: \"How can his business be good if you give this name? You really should let him change it.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing echoed, \"Yes! I told her too, but she was very obsessed and refused to change anything. I had no choice. I am not very familiar with her and I don't know much.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi put down the chopsticks in his hand and smiled and said, \"Okay, you eat. I actually drank a little more at noon today. In addition, I was a little tired from the Fengcheng City these days, so I went to rest first. Ling Er, Master Jiu, you take care of Nian Bing, the dormitory has been arranged for him. Just take him there, Nian Bing, the trade will not restrain your freedom, but I hope you can stay for more days and keep your body in a tight manner.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing responded quickly, stood up, and watched Long Zhi leave. He knew that he had been shut down for a while, but Long Zhi would definitely send someone to check the water truck. With the cleverness of the monkey, he should not reveal the brokenness. Thinking of this, he felt a little relaxed and finally had the mood to eat. The dishes on the table tasted average, but for him who had grown old, he would have done it.\n\n\n\nTeacher Jiu finally spoke for the first time, \"Nianbing, what are your plans in the future? Should you stay in the industry to practice, or go out to practice?\" He said the word \"无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无无� \n\n\n\nNian Bing put a bite of the dish into her mouth and said in a vague way, \"I haven't thought about it yet, but I must stay in the library for more days, so I'll talk about what's going on in the future.\"\n\n\n\nTeacher Jiu said a little disgusted: \"It's really not good. Don't you know that eating something is a kind of disgraceful behavior?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing knew that he deliberately beat him up, but he didn't care. He swallowed the things in his mouth and said, \"I'm so sorry. I came from a small place and didn't understand these gifts at all. I would like to ask Master Jiu to teach you more in the future.\" He looked terrified on his face, and he was sneering in his heart. It was too easy to deal with villains like Master Jiu.Long Ling said, \"Brother, don't blame Bing. Let's teach him more in the future. Bing, eat more, and it will be difficult for you to see your daily life.\"\n\n\n\nIn the strange atmosphere, a meal ended. The teacher Jiu was sneering at Nian Bing for a while, and Long Ling kept saying something to him, making Mr. Jiu even more jealous. Nian Bing was like no one, eating very much, and feeding his stomach without any politeness. \n\n\n\n\"Brother Tsun Nine, Ling Er, I have eaten, you see...\" Nian Bing looked at Tsun Nine with innocent eyes.\n\n\n\nLong Ling stood up and said, \"Let's go, I'll take you there. The food at the trade fair is getting worse and worse now. Nian Bing, I'll take you to Qingfeng to eat another day, and the food there is delicious.\"\n\n\n\nMaster Jiu also stood up, looked at Long Ling intoxicatedly, and said, \"My sister, go back and rest. I'll send Nian Bing over.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling didn't hold on, she smiled slightly and said, \"Brother, that's a nuisance to you. Nian Bingxin comes, if you don't understand anything, please teach him more.\"\n\n\n\nTeacher Jiu looked at Nian Bing deeply, smiled at Long Ling and said, \"Don't worry, sister, I will. Nian Bing, let's go.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said goodbye to Long Ling and followed Teacher Jiu out of the restaurant. Along the way, Teacher Jiu said nothing and walked towards the magician dormitory with Nian Bing. The top building in the dormitory was not big. When he walked into the building, Nian Bing carefully observed it. There were about fifty rooms here. As the Lizan Demonic Instructor said, only those who practiced above the Great Magician could arrange their place to live here.\n\n\n\nMaster Jiu took Nian Bing and walked to an important position on the road. He took out a silver key from the ground and opened the door. He turned around and looked at Nian Bing, and said, \"It's here.\"\n\n\n\nWalking into the room, Nian Bing looked around. There were two rooms inside and outside. The room outside was about 20 square meters. A three-person sand and two single-person sand were discharged. The room was very refreshing. The floor was boarded. When you walked, you would make a light sound. You could enter the door in the outer room. It is a hand washing room with a size of six or seven square meters, with all toiletries, and the room is relatively small, about ten square meters in size. A large bed with a wide big bed looks very comfortable. The magic lights in the room are radiating soft yellow light, which is indeed a comfortable place for living. \n\n\n\nMaster Jiubing closed the door with his hands, walked to the sand and sat down, \"There are 24 hours of hot water here, you can wash up anytime. You can eat at the restaurant outside, not just that. There is a big restaurant on the right side of the door outside, which is a public canteen. Of course, you can also ask the servants to deliver the food to the room to eat. If you need anything, just press the magic button on the wall.\" As he said, he pointed to a red button on the wall.\n\n\n\nNian Bingxin said that he is indeed a magician association. All equipment is built based on magic. The treatment of his great magician is really good.\n\n\n\nMaster Jiu pointed to the sand beside him and said to Nianbing, \"Sit down, I have a few words to say to you.\"\n\n\n\nOf course, Nian Bing knew what he was going to say. He showed a confused look on his face. He walked to the sand beside Mr. Jiu and sat down. Mr. Jiu didn't look at him and said calmly: \"Nian Bing, after joining the trade fair, your identity has become different, but you are just a newcomer. It is best to focus all your energy on the magic cultivation and not think about anything else. Especially don't get close to people who should not be approached. I have lived here for twenty years. For everything that is more familiar to you than you, it is best to listen to this advice to avoid future problems.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled in her heart and said, \"Mr. Ninja, I don't quite understand what you mean. Yes, I don't thank you for introducing me to the trade fair. If it weren't for your help and Miss Ling, the trade fair wouldn't have been so easy to join.\"\n\n\n\nTeacher Jiu leaned on the back of the sand and said unhappily: \"It's good that you know. In the trade fair, although I am not a demon, I have a similar status as a demon. As for Ling, the teacher has high expectations for her. Most of her energy will be focused on her cultivation. If there is nothing to do in the future, please don't look for her, do you understand? I grew up with Ling's childhood sweetheart. In the future, she will definitely be my wife. I don't want other men to get close to her too much.\" Seeing Nian Bing was a little foolish, Teacher Jiu couldn't help but speak. \n\n\n\nNian Bing suddenly said, \"So it's like this. Only a talent like Master Nine Brother can be worthy of Miss Ling. I'll congratulate you here.\"\n\n\n\nA happier expression appeared in Master Jiu's eyes. The previous unhappiness was about to chant Bing, and the smoke disappeared, \"Do you think so?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said sincerely: \"Of course, when I first met Master Jiu and Miss Ling, I realized that you are a match made in heaven. Brother, don't worry, I just treat Miss Ling as an ordinary friend. With my humble background, I can't have any thoughts.\"\n\n\n\nTeacher Jiu heard that Nian Bing was so clear. He was overjoyed and smiled slightly, saying, \"Brother, since you have joined the trade association, don't mention this identity again. With your character, you will definitely find a good companion in the future.\" He was so satisfied with Nian Bing's identity that he could no longer satisfy. He immediately changed his name to brother, and was in a good mood.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"In the future, I will rely on my elder brother to help you in the trade fair. You must give me more advice. If you have any questions in the future, even if you have something to do, as long as I can do it, it will not be subject to rebellion.\"\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nBecause I have to go back to my parents' home every Tuesday, I will update a little late in the morning. I hope everyone understands it.",

    "content": "Master Jiu stood up and said, \"Okay, in the future, you don't understand anything you don't understand in the trade fair. Even if you ask me, it's getting late, I won't let you rest. From now on, we are brothers. I'll leave first.\" Master Jiu handed the key in his hand to Nian Bing. He also had a small calculation in his heart. He knew that Nian Bing's magic level was stronger than himself. Since he had no heart, he would have a more brother. He would naturally have a good chance of his position in the Magic Masters Association of the Ice Moon Empire in the future.\n\n\n\nNian Bing stood up and delivered Master Jiu to the door, smiling and said, \"Brother, you should rest early, I won't give it to you.\"\n\n\n\nTeacher Jiu suddenly smiled mysteriously and said in a low voice, \"I heard the teacher, you are very interested in the information in the library. I tell you that in fact, the first three levels are just some ordinary magic data. Only the fourth level has the secrets in our trade fair, but there is a very harmful magic restriction there, and even the magicians in the trade fair cannot enter.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's heart was moved and said, \"Brother, then, can you have a way to enter?\"\n\n\n\nThe teacher said confidently: \"I didn't tell you just that. I have a special status in the trade fair. I grew up with my fellow teacher. I once entered the fourth level with Ling and Master. We are actually disciples of Master. We will receive some care. However, this is a secret. Don't tell me. If you have the chance in the future, I might also take you in and have a look. Just The various kinds of records there are very difficult to understand, but in fact, there is no big effect when going in. The current meditation method between Ling Er and I is obtained from the information there. It is much faster to cultivate our minds than ordinary people. In the future, we will be a family, and there are good places, and my brother will never forget you.\" After speaking, Master Jiu smiled mysteriously towards Nian Bing and turned away. \n\n\n\nAs soon as he left, Nian Bing also laughed. Is this to buy me? It seems that this Master Jiu also has the idea of joining the party to engage in private affairs. If he is good, he is afraid that he is too decent and capable. In the future, as long as he is favored by himself, there will be no secrets in the fourth floor of this library. I wonder what special magic records are there? Thinking of this, Nian Bing's heart couldn't help but feel hot. If he could learn more powerful magic, going to the Ice God Tower would not be just a dream. When he walked inside, Nian Bing carefully took out his morning dew sword from the bottom of the bed, hid it under the bed, looked around, and then walked out of the room with the newly obtained ice stick. Let's go back to Qingfeng first. After coming out for such a long time, I hope Uncle Li will not be suspicious, and I hope my luck will not be so bad. Mingyuan should not be bothered by himself.\n\n\n\nThinking of this very likely incident, Nian Bing hurriedly left the Magicians Association as fast as possible. After confirming that no one followed him, he removed the magic robe on his body, bought a square cloth from the street, and put both the magic robe and the ice stick in it to bread it. Only then did he return to the Qingfeng with the fastest degree.\n\n\n\nAs soon as he entered the back door, he immediately saw a long red figure, and his whole body suddenly froze, \"Little, Miss, why are you here?\"\"This time I was surprised was definitely not a fake one.\n\n\n\nXue Jing turned around and looked at Nian Bing with a bad face, \"Hello! I heard Uncle Li say you left at noon, why didn't you come back now? Don't tell me, you're out for wind.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"Miss, look at me, what kind of silly boy, can you breathe like? Are you going to the backyard to practice the sport today?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jinghu snorted and said, \"I know you don't dare to go out for Fengliu. If you want Fengliu to have a capital, I will just give you a favor. I don't have that ability yet. I have looked for you a few times today, but I'm not here. I'm here waiting for you. I'm here to see when you will come back. It's up to you, it's not too late to come back. I'll tell you this time, but you'll give me some attention in the future.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing pointed to the bag with the magic wand and magic robe in his hand and said, \"Miss, I'm just going to buy clothes. This is the first time I have come to such a big city and went out to buy a few coarse cloth clothes. It's good luck. When I encounter it, I'm selling it. Two coppers are worth a lot. Do you want to take a look?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing said a little disgusted: \"What do you think? It's just a few torn clothes.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing relaxed his voice and said to himself that his approach to advance and retreat was obviously correct. The reason why he solved the burden was because Xue Jingyuan had previously put her eyes on it.\n\n\n\nXue Jinghui Nianbing was silent, her expression softened a little, and she said, \"Your face has recovered so quickly. It seems that her face is thick.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing touched her face. If it weren't for the first-level treatment, it would probably not be cured in a week. She beat herself and said that her face was thick, woman, it's really...\n\n\n\nXue Jing said, \"Nianbing, I have something to ask you for help now, but I don't know if you want to do it.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned and said, \"Miss, I am just an ordinary firewood master. What can I help you?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jinghu snorted and said, \"Don't worry about this, just say whether you want to be willing or not.\"\n\n\n\nCan Nian Bing say it? He didn't plan to leave the wind at this time, so he had to helplessly and said, \"It's my blessing to be able to help the lady.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing's eyes lit up. She was already beautiful and added a little more spirit. Her eyes seemed to say, \"You know, it's best,\"Okay, then we'll decide. I'm going to lend you this face for use.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was shocked, \"Miss, you...\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing said disdainfully, \"Looking at your appearance, there is no man's temper. What are you afraid of? I won't eat you.\" Speaking of this, there was a sudden red color on her pretty face, and her voice became lowered. Then, \"Do you remember what I told you in the pavilion last time? What I want to help you is related to that.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingmei had a slight head and said, \"Are you the one you like? What can I help here?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jinghu snorted and said, \"Anyway, you have already agreed. If this is done well, I will ask Uncle Mingyuan to teach you a few more tricks so that you can survive better in the future.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingyan sighed and said, \"Miss, then you must tell me first what I want to do.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jingyu walked to Nian Bing's body and said in a low voice: \"I want you to be my boyfriend.\"\n\n\n\nSmelling the fragrance of the girl on the body of Xue Jing, listening to the sudden soft words, Nian Bing couldn't help but control her mind as if she was in the cloud, and said, \"Miss, this may not work. You, you are a lady, I'm just a servant...\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing raised her hand and hit Nian Bing on the shoulder, and said in a slight angrily, \"Did you hear me say it's good? It's really a toad that wants to eat the meat of heaven. Do you think I really want to be my boyfriend! I just want you to help me try that guy to see if he is interested in me. Tomorrow night, I You will be asked to go to a banquet with me, and you are still good, so I just said that I would lend you this application. At that time, that person will come and I will show more warmth to you. If he has me in his heart, he will definitely feel jealous. At that time, then...\" \n\n\n\nNian Bing's heart was cold for no reason. Does the toad want to eat the meat of the turtle? Snow, Snow, you underestimate me too much. I may not be able to see girls like you. I remember this sentence, one day, I will report it back to you. The misfortune of childhood made Nian Bing unable to be extreme. She looked at Xue Jing coldly. At this time, she was lowering her head, as if she was thinking about a bright future.\n\n\n\n\"Miss, although I'm still old, I'm afraid it's not appropriate to have a low status.\" Nian Bing deliberately said it heavy.\n\n\n\nXue Jingyun didn't hear the change in her chanting language, and said impatiently: \"I have my own plans. Since you are asked to follow me, you will naturally not let you lose your face. That is my face. Not everyone can participate in this upper-level banquet in Ice and Snow City, or maybe you can only see this time. You should thank me for being right. Yes, I would like to recommend it. Tomorrow I will prepare a magic robe to make you a magician, and I will arrange other things, so you don’t have to worry about it. Tomorrow you don’t have to work, and in the morning I will go to you to teach you some necessary gifts. When you arrive at the banquet, you don’t have to do anything. Just follow me, it’s enough. Do you understand?”\n\n\n\nNian Bing's heart became even colder. She pointed at her head and said, \"Okay, I will do it as well as possible to make you satisfied.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing smiled slightly and said, \"Don't worry, I'll definitely count the numbers. As long as you do well, I will naturally feel the truth after I come back. That's it. You should rest early and be more energetic tomorrow.\" After speaking, the red figure suddenly rose up, and disappeared in the blink of an eye.\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at the direction where Xue Jing turned away coldly and said to herself: \"For the sake of your solution for me, I won't consider it with you. But this is the last time.No one can insult me without paying for it. \"Suddenly, he moved in the sea, thought of something, and took a picture of his own head, \"Ah! Why did I forget the contract? It seems that I have to go back to the magician to have a trip.\" It was time to go to the contract, and I don't know what tricks the ice magician could do.",

    "content": "Please vote more, please collect more.\n\n---\n\nRetrieving all his belongings from his living quarters in the woodshed, he walked out through the back door. A gentle breeze brushed the street; breathing the fresh yet somewhat cold air, Nie Bing felt a little more comfortable. Looking at the bustling crowds on the street and the lit lamps, he suddenly felt a little lost. Just starting out in society, he had already encountered so many things. Although he hadn't made any wrong choices so far, should he still stay in Ice Snow City? Yes, he must stay. Even if the culinary arts at Qingfeng Restaurant couldn't pique his interest, the Mages' Guild library and Feng Nu's Zhengyang Blade, which was currently being made, were both things he needed. One month, he would stay for just this last month. Xue Jing, tomorrow night, I might give you some surprises. I just want you to know, don't casually underestimate anyone. Although I won't retaliate against you, I should at least teach your difficult temper a lesson.\n\nBy the time Nie Bing returned to the Mages' Guild, it was already late. Before entering the guild, he changed back into his magic robe. With the Grand Mage symbol on his chest and by presenting his badge, the night watchmen wouldn't stop him at all. Nie Bing didn't go directly to find the Ice Archmage. Instead, he first returned to his room, checked that the Morning Dew Blade was still under the mattress, and found a place to hide the things he had brought. Reopening the door, he first looked around. The corridor was empty, with no one around. Only then did he step out of the room, pulled the door shut behind him, and headed towards the westernmost side.\n\nAs he walked, Nie Bing restrained his mental energy, controlling the Ice-Fire Co-origin Vortex within his body to spin rapidly, with ice on the outside and fire on the inside, concealing the aura of his fire elemental magic power. This was his greatest secret.\n\nThe westernmost room, from the outside, didn't appear unusual. It was similar to his own room. He raised his hand and knocked a few times on the door. \"Hello, I am Nie Bing.\"\n\nThe door opened silently. An aged and deep voice came from inside. \"Come in.\"\n\nAs soon as he entered the room, Nie Bing immediately felt a surge of coldness wash over him. Subconsciously, he raised the Ice Thorn Staff in his hand, and a level-two Ice Screen Spell instantly formed in front of him. The room suddenly lit up. This was also an antechamber, only much larger than the one he had just been in. On the sofa, the Ice Archmage looked at him and nodded approvingly, saying, \"Not bad, you react quickly. No wonder Li Da speaks so highly of you. However, as an archmage, this alone isn't enough for self-defense. If your opponent is a master of martial arts, under a sudden sneak attack, you would have no way to defend yourself. Such low-level magic is useless.\"\n\nNie Bing was momentarily stunned, then nodded and said, \"Thank you for your guidance, senior.\"\n\nThe Ice Archmage pointed to a nearby sofa and said, \"Sit down. I called you here because I have a few words to say to you. Whether you take them to heart or not, that's up to you.\"\n\nNie Bing sat on the sofa, feigning a lack of vigilance. In front of an archmage, even being vigilant would be useless. Moreover, he was deeply convinced that, at least for now, this Ice Archmage had no ill intentions towards him.\n\nWith a flash of light, a transparent gem suddenly appeared in the Ice Archmage's hand. The gem sparkled with seven-colored light. Before Nie Bing could react, he clearly felt a vast and powerful magical force enveloping his body. What was strange was that this magical force was not offensive in nature. The light receded, and the transparent gem, which had been sparkling with seven-colored light, returned to its calm state. The Ice Archmage seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, and said calmly, \"My name is Bing Jing. You can call me Teacher Bing Jing from now on. Nie Bing, since you cultivate ice elemental magic, why did you come to the guild instead of the Ice God Tower? As a mage, I believe you should know that the most longed-for place for all ice elemental mages is the Ice God Tower. Only there can you learn the most profound ice elemental magic. I don't need to say more about that, do I?\"\n\nNie Bing's heart greatly trembled, but he tried his best to remain calm and said, \"To be frank, Teacher Bing Jing, I don't like places like the Ice God Tower. I feel that the restrictions there are too strong. I don't know why, but the Ice God Tower always gives me a very overbearing feeling. And I only wish to cultivate magic peacefully, not to get involved in any conflicts, and I certainly don't want to become a tool of the Ice God Tower, so...\"\n\nBing Jing suddenly stood up, cold light flashing continuously in her eyes. \"Nie Bing, do you know who you are speaking to? Let me tell you frankly, I am one of the Ice-Snow Priests of the Ice God Tower. Now I'm giving you a chance to choose. Leave here, head north and join the Ice God Tower. With my introduction, I believe you will surely be highly valued in the Ice God Tower.\"\n\nNie Bing inwardly sneered, and also stood up. With a slight frown, he said righteously, \"I'm sorry, Teacher Bing Jing, since I have already joined the guild, I am a part of the guild. Although the Ice God Tower is good, it's not where I wish to go. Please forgive me, if there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.\" After speaking, he turned and began to walk out.\n\nBing Jing's body radiated intense cold light, and the temperature in the room plummeted. Enveloped in frosty mist, she said coldly, \"Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?\"\n\nNie Bing turned around, looking at Bing Jing unflinchingly. \"Teacher Bing Jing, I don't think you would do that. This is the Mages' Guild, not your Ice God Tower. I truly don't understand why the Ice God Tower and the Mages' Guild, both pillars of the Ice Moon Empire, should be hostile towards each other. No matter what, I will not join the Ice God Tower.\" As he spoke, a hint of resolute chill unconsciously appeared in his eyes. This was not feigned; although the hatred for the Ice God Tower had always been buried deep within Nie Bing's heart, it would occasionally surface unintentionally.\n\nBing Jing's body retracted its cold aura, and she smiled. At this moment, the door to the inner room suddenly opened, and two people walked out: Guild Master Long Zhi and the Water Archmage Li Da.\n\nBing Jing smiled slightly. \"Guild Master, you can rest assured now, right? This child is neither the person the Ice God Tower is looking for, nor is he someone who would casually betray the guild.\"\n\nLong Zhi nodded contentedly, looking at the perplexed Nie Bing, and said, \"Child, this time it was our fault. You're new to the guild, and we had to test you. Now that everything has been proven, I hope you can understand. Don't worry, with your loyalty to the guild, the guild will certainly not treat you shabbily. Alright, you may leave now.\"\n\nNie Bing, bewildered, bowed to the three and exited the room. Long Zhi turned his head to Li Da beside him and said, \"What do you think?\"\n\nLi Da smiled faintly. \"What else is there to think? I told you long ago, this child appears to be simple-minded and devoted to learning. He will certainly become a powerful mage in the future.\"\n\nLong Zhi sighed softly, saying, \"From the current perspective, that does seem to be the case. He's either truly inexperienced in the ways of the world, or his schemes are so deep that even I can't discern his true thoughts.\"\n\nBing Jing handed the transparent gem, sparkling with seven-colored light, to Long Zhi, and said, \"Guild Master, I think you're overthinking it. Even if his schemes are deep, it may not necessarily be bad for us. As long as he's not the person the Ice God Tower is looking for, not the so-called Demon Slayer Envoy, that's enough. We can just observe him more closely in the future. Oh, right, that child Shi Jiu seemed to have stayed in his room for a while earlier. Then Nie Bing went out and only came back after a while. I don't know what he went to do. I originally wanted to send someone to follow him, but I was afraid he would discover it. He was gone for a full shichen.\"¹\n\nLong Zhi said helplessly, \"What he went to do doesn't matter. He probably went back to the inn to get his luggage. However, we didn't wait in vain for this shichen, did we? Although it couldn't be fully proven, at least a part of it was proven. Actually, he spent the entire afternoon reading various basic materials in the library, which already made me stop doubting him. When I just returned from Qingfeng Restaurant, I observed him through the window. He was indeed very focused, something that absolutely couldn't be faked. Shi Jiu is fundamentally good-natured, and his talent is also quite good; it's just that he's a bit too conceited. If I'm not mistaken, he must have sought Nie Bing because of Ling'er. To be honest, from now on, I'd rather entrust Ling'er to this Nie Bing than let Ling'er marry him. No matter how cunning Nie Bing is, he's much stronger than Little Jiu.\"\n\n---\n¹ A *shichen* (時辰) is a traditional Chinese unit of time equivalent to two hours.",

Guild Master, you must be tired today, too. Let's head back and rest early.\"\n\nThe moment Nian Bing left Bing Jing's room, he felt his whole body was soaked in a cold sweat. That seven-colored gemstone was clearly a magical detection item; he was lucky he hadn't brought the Morning Dew Blade with him. All of his previous reactions had been an act. Bing Jing couldn't fool him at all. Back at the Ice God Tower, Nian Bing had seen all twelve Ice and Snow Priests, and their faces were deeply imprinted in his mind. How could he possibly have forgotten them? It was thanks to this that he was able to pass the Magicians Guild's final test.\n\nReturning to his own room, he retrieved the Morning Dew Blade and tucked it into his robes, then took off his magician's robe and placed it on the bed along with the Ice Crystal Staff. Only then did he leave the Magicians Guild again. Perhaps tonight would be his last night at the Pure Wind Studio. Tomorrow would mark a new beginning—a beginning at the Magicians Guild.\n\nAt dawn, as a ray of morning sun rose slowly from the east, Nian Bing had already awoken from his meditation. The few basic magic books from yesterday had not been read in vain. Through his cultivation and practice during the night, his understanding of magic had deepened significantly. Although the principle of Ice and Fire Sharing the Same Origin was still not entirely clear, his control over magic had become much easier. What he needed most right now was not to increase his magical power, but to fully integrate his spiritual power with his existing ice-and-fire magic. Only then could he unleash its greater potential. Nian Bing firmly believed that once he had completely merged the powers of ice and fire, the magic produced would not be as simple as one plus one equals two. An Ice-Fire dual-element magician… he was likely the first on the continent. Why couldn't he create his own magic?\n\nWalking out of his room, he saw that Uncle Li didn't seem to be up yet. Nian Bing looked at the vast grounds of the Pure Wind Studio and couldn't help but sigh softly. It seemed there were no more culinary arts for him to pursue here. First-rate culinary skills, second-rate magic—that was an accurate description of him right now. Perhaps the Magicians Guild was a more suitable place for him now. There, at least, he could learn many useful things.\n\nLost in thought, Nian Bing walked over to the woodpile, picked up the firewood axe, and began to chop with lightning-like speed. Although each block only needed to be split into eight pieces, he remained intensely focused. He had long grown accustomed to this method of concentrating his mind. The pile of chopped wood grew steadily. Nian Bing had always believed that one should see things through from start to finish; even though he had decided to leave, he would still do his final day's work properly. In his hands, the firewood axe was like a living thing, its shadow almost invisible. All he needed to do was use his left hand to continuously bring blocks over from the side, and they would naturally be split into eight pieces.\n\nUncle Li emerged from his room. Seeing Nian Bing with his back to him, busy chopping wood, he couldn't help but smile, thinking to himself what a diligent young man, working so early in the morning. But when he walked up to Nian Bing's side and saw the way the axe had become a blur, Uncle Li was stunned. Nian Bing had already completed over seventy percent of a full day's work.\n\nNian Bing knew Uncle Li had approached, but he didn't stop. He continued chopping and said calmly, \"Uncle Li, chopping wood isn't just a job. If you focus on it, you can achieve unexpected results. The wood is inanimate, but people are alive, wouldn't you say so?\"\n\nUncle Li stared at Nian Bing, momentarily speechless. For the first time, he felt that this handsome young man before him was not simple at all—far more mysterious than he had imagined.\n\n\"This is the last piece. Uncle Li, let me leave you a souvenir.\" The firewood axe suddenly became nimble. With a light flourish of the blade, the bark peeled away silently, and wood shavings flew amidst the flashing steel. Guided by the carving principles of his knife work, the axe seemed to come alive. The block of wood in Nian Bing's hands gradually took shape. When the final flash of the blade passed, it was no longer a piece of wood, but a person—a human figurine.\n\nUncle Li discovered with astonishment that the figurine was of himself, one hand resting on a log, the other raising the firewood axe as if preparing to strike. The statue was so lifelike it was as if it were real.\n\nNian Bing handed both the axe and the statue to Uncle Li. He bowed slightly and said, \"Uncle Li, thank you for your care these past few days. Please keep this as a memento. I hope you will still remember me.\"\n\nUncle Li clutched the still-warm statue and was about to say something when a crisp voice called out from nearby. \"Nian Bing, are you up? Hurry and come with me, we're short on time.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, dusted the wood shavings off his clothes, and said, \"Miss, I've been up for a while. Let's go.\" After giving Uncle Li one last deep look, he headed toward the direction Xue Jing had appeared from.\n\nToday, Xue Jing was surprisingly not wearing her favorite red clothes. A long white dress made her look much more charming. \"Come on, let's go to my place.\" Grabbing Nian Bing's sleeve without a hint of reservation, she led him deeper into the Pure Wind Studio. Uncle Li watched their departing figures, then looked down at the statue in his hand and sighed softly, muttering to himself, \"It seems this wood-chopping job will be up to me from now on!\"\n\nXue Jing led Nian Bing all the way to a courtyard. Upon entering, Nian Bing was immediately greeted by a fresh scent. The yard wasn't large, about three or four hundred square meters. A small stone path led straight to the far end. As far as the eye could see, the entire courtyard was covered in green. A giant tree, in particular, towered over everything, its branches and leaves spreading out like a huge green umbrella that shaded more than half the yard. Following the stone path, he saw a wooden house with what appeared to be two or three rooms. Though made of wood, it looked very sturdy. In the center of the lawn was a small pond, about ten square meters in size, its water crystal clear. Palm-length red goldfish swam about inside, looking indescribably leisurely and content.\n\nXue Jing turned to Nian Bing, looking somewhat smug. \"So, my place isn't too bad, is it? I'm the only one who lives here. Besides Sister Ling'er and my family, you're the first outsider to ever come here. Let's go, I have everything ready for you. I had a hard time borrowing these from Ling'er, so you have to be careful. Don't you dare break them and make it impossible for me to answer to her.\"\n\nNian Bing followed Xue Jing into the wooden house. The interior was much simpler than he had imagined. A light pink color scheme gave it an elegant and refreshing look. Xue Jing took a set of magician's robes from the bed and handed them to Nian Bing. The robes were red and also bore the insignia of the Ice Moon Empire. There were two silver rings around the flame embroidery on the chest, one less than the robe he had received yesterday. This must be the robe symbolizing a High-Rank Magician. Nian Bing found it slightly amusing; he, a Great Magician, was now going to impersonate a High-Rank Magician. The feeling was a bit odd.\n\nXue Jing handed the robes to Nian Bing and said, \"Try them on first, see if they fit. I think they should be about right. Attending the banquet as a High-Rank Magician, plus with you being so young, no one should look down on you. What do you think? I'm pretty thoughtful, right?\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Xue Jing and smiled. \"Are you just going to stand there and watch me change?\"\n\nXue Jing's pretty face flushed red. \"Who wants to watch you? Just hurry up.\" Though she said this, she still walked out of the room.\n\nNian Bing took off his outer clothes and put on the red magician's robe. The faint aura of the fire element felt very comfortable, and it fit well.\n\n\"Are you done yet?\" Xue Jing called out impatiently from the doorway.\n\n\"I'm done.\" Nian Bing straightened his clothes and looked toward the door. Xue Jing pushed it open and walked in. The first time she saw Nian Bing dressed in the red fire-element High-Rank Magician's robe, she was completely stunned. Set against the red robe, his long golden hair was like a blazing fire, and his blue eyes looked so profound. That hint of arrogant temperament, in particular, made her heart race.\n\nBeing stared at by Xue Jing's scorching gaze made Nian Bing a little uncomfortable. \"Miss, is something wrong with how I look?\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Xiao San (小三):** Literally \"Little Three,\" this is the pen name/nickname of the author, Tang Jia San Shao.",

Thank you.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nXue Jing returned to his mind and secretly stole himself. What's wrong? He is just better looking? It's just a flower pillow, it's quiet and silent. Don't be confused by his appearance. Such a man is not worthy of his own favor. Taking a deep breath, he walked to Nian Bing and looked carefully, and said, \"It's OK, it's quite fit. No, wearing good clothes is like a human being. Yes, you must maintain this kind of spirit and a bit arrogant. At that time, at the banquet, if I don't show you my gesture, you don't just open your mouth and just follow me.\"\n\n\n\nI thought Bing was a little bit and said, \"Miss, the banquet only started at night, so what am I fucking now?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing said, \"There are a lot of things to do. I will teach you some gifts at the banquet first. Oh, by the way, will you dance?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingxin said: Jump five? It's still jumping six. He slammed his head and said, \"I won't.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing said, \"That's it. It's going to be a long time. I hope you can learn it quickly and it's easy to use it in the evening. Let's start now, I'll teach you the gift first.\"\n\n\n\nHalf a while later, Xue Jing's shocked voice came out from the wooden house, \"Nianbing, have you learned the gifts before? You can do these things better than me.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, I won't! What did you do just now? I just learned this.\" He really won't be able to do it? Of course not. As early as a child, he learned these under his father's teachings. His father said that these are essential for social gathering. At this time, he naturally recalled the scene of the time, which was very natural and smooth to do. \n\n\n\nXue Jing looked at Nian Bing with some confusion and said, \"Okay! I can't tell that you have a very high understanding. You don't need to learn to be a tribute. Let's start learning to dance. If you dance, you can learn so quickly. I'll ask you to have something good at noon.\"\n\n\n\nAt this moment, a clear voice came out from outside, \"Silent, the clothes you want are ready.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jinghu was shocked, \"It's bad, my dad is here, Nian Bing, you hide first, but don't let my dad see it.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingling said, \"But, your room is so big, where should I hide?\"\n\n\n\nThe sound outside sounded again, \"You are so big, the courtyard door doesn't matter. It's so big, and it's still so ma Hu. I see who will come to marry you.\" This time, the sound was much closer to the wooden house.\n\n\n\nXue Jinghu looked around anxiously, and suddenly, her eyes lit up. She hurriedly pulled Nian Bing to the bed and pushed him onto the bed. Her shoes were too late to take off, so she hurriedly lowered the curtains on both sides. Do all this and the door outside is just open.\n\n\n\nXue Jingyu met in a panic, \"Dad, why did you send it to him by yourself?\"\n\n\n\nLying on the soft bed and whispering the faint fragrance, Nian Bing couldn't help but sigh in his heart, and only heard the clear voice, \"You are so crazy, I haven't seen anyone recently. Dad miss you. Your mother has gone early, so you are the only one Dad. Can't you be able to see your daughter?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing's mood had calmed down, and Sa said, \"Dad is the best. Then I will accompany you more recently. Oh, by the way, will you go to the banquet tonight?\"\n\n\n\n\"I? Of course I won't go. It's a banquet for you young people. You, learn more with others. Look at how gentle and well-behaved, you can get crazy and crazy like you. Who dares to approach you? If you can't get married, my dad will not be responsible.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing said angrily, \"Dad, how can you call your daughter like this? Your daughter is so beautiful, and there are so many people chasing me. I just don't like them.\"\n\n\n\nThe clear and clear voice smiled and said, \"Is that? Why did I hear that the young men in the city now run away when they see you, and are you afraid of being beaten?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing snorted and said, \"That's because they are useless. Even if I want to marry, I have to marry Han, a man with a strong position. I can't beat him, and they are not qualified.\"\n\n\n\nThe clear voice said helplessly, \"But last time I introduced those young men to you, each of whom has great strength. Don't you want to do the same?\"\n\n\n\n\"Of course I can't take it anymore. Those guys have their eyes on the top, and they are too long. How can they match me with big and thick ones?\"\n\n\n\n\"Then I have no choice, you should find it yourself. As long as you want, I have no conditions to support Dad. That's all.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing smiled and said, \"Then don't worry. I'm only eighteen years old anyway, so there's no hurry. You'll be clean again these two days. You'll go back first. I'll change my clothes to see if it fits.\"\n\n\n\nLying on the bed, listening to the conversation between Xue Jing and his daughter, Nian Bing couldn't say anything, and once, I had the same concern for my father! But now... when he thought of this, his body subconsciously moved, and a very slight sound came out. \n\n\n\n\"Who is it? Jing, why are there people in your bed?\" The clear voice fell cold.\n\n\n\nXue Jingming looked anxious, \"Dad, it's nothing, it's just a girl.\"\n\n\n\n\"You guys? I'm going to see what this guy looks like.\" Manbu lifted up suddenly, and Nian Bing looked up. He saw only a handsome middle-aged man in white in his thirties or forties standing by the bed. From his cold eyes, he could see that he could tear himself apart at any time.\n\n\n\nSitting up from the bed calmly, Nian Bing stood up. He could understand the mood of middle-aged people very well. Seeing a strange man on his daughter's bed, who would not feel better if he changed.\n\n\n\nThe middle-aged man turned his head and looked at Xue Jing, and said coldly: \"Is this what you are talking about?\"\"He was indeed very angry, but when he really saw Nian Bing's appearance, his anger became smaller. This young man on the bed looked handsome, and suddenly saw himself, he was not surprised. In addition, he was wearing a fire magic robe symbolizing a high-level magician, which was enough to prove that he was worthy of his daughter. My daughter has grown up, and some strange friends have nothing to do. Although he is lying on the bed, he is dressed neatly, which is obviously because of his sudden arrival.\n\n\n\nXue Jing looked at her father in awkwardly, turned her head and looked at Nian Bing angrily, and said, \"Dad, he, he is just a friend of mine. You came suddenly. I was afraid that you would mislead...\"\n\n\n\nThe middle-aged man laughed, \"Will you miss my daughter? You're so excited to do it? You're just trying to get tired of it. Silly, I don't know when you met this fire magician. Let me introduce it to my dad.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing was about to say something, and Nian Bing opened her mouth, \"Hello, my name is Nian Bing. Actually, I am not a fire magician. This dress was borrowed by the lady. I am just a servant who chops wood by Qingfeng.\" Since Xue Jing has looked down on him, why bother to let his father misunderstand?\n\n\n\nXue Feng smiled and said, \"Water chopping? I didn't hear anything wrong. Jing, I need you to explain it.\" Although his voice was still calm, the atmosphere emitted from his body made Nian Bing clearly identify that this Qingfeng boss must have great martial arts. At least he is also a master. Compared with him, Xue Jing is definitely not a file in terms of atmosphere.\n\n\n\nXue Jing glared at Nian Bing fiercely, \"Where are you talking about here, I'll take me out.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing didn't say anything, and looked at Xue Jingru deeply and walked out of the room with great strides.\n\n\n\nXue Jing turned to her father and stuttered in a low voice, \"Dad, you know that I have never had a boyfriend. Nian Bing is a wood chopper who came to our family for a while. At this evening's banquet, the girlfriends all have their own male companions, but I don't have one. Nian Bing is OK, so I wanted to let him pretend, so I borrowed a magic robe from Ling'er. So, I was teaching him a gift.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hu Zhu, it's really Hu Zhu. You can think of this way. How can you never think of it? Is this fair? They are here to work, not for you to play with it.\" Although Xue Jin was scolding Xue Jing, she had already smiled a little more on her face. She thought to herself, only her daughter could come up with such a ghost idea.\n\n\n\nXue Jing saw that her father seemed to be not really angry, so she grabbed her father's arm and laughed, \"What's wrong with me? It's always easier to do things for me than to chop firewood.\"\n\n\n\nXue Feng looked slightly and said, \"You can't say this. Everyone has their own right to survive. You, a girl, should pay attention to it. I think that young man is quite good. He looks calm and steady. He is really just a chopping wood?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing said, \"Of course it's true. I've called him in. That day, he wanted to go to Dacheng, but he met Liao San's powerful villain. If I hadn't saved him, he would have been beaten up. Although he was still good, I wouldn't like this kind of slutty pillow. Dad, don't worry, there will be no problem.\"\n\n\n\nXueqi smiled bitterly and said, \"It would be great if you could really reassure me. Okay, I'll leave, you can watch it yourself. Pay attention to your sense of caution. You are a girl, so you should pay attention to rules and avoid being laughed at. If you stay with you, I'm afraid my heart will be in trouble.\"",

    "content": "Here is tonight's chapter. Please add it to your collections. The Sunday featured post event is still on, at the same time as always.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nXue Jing stuck out her tongue and personally saw her father to the door. As they stepped outside, she saw Nian Bing standing on the stone path, his gaze fixed on the large tree, lost in thought.\n\nXue Ji walked over to Nian Bing's side and smiled. \"Young man, just keep working hard here at the Clear Wind Inn. My daughter can be a bit mischievous, but she's a good person at heart. I understand what happened earlier was a misunderstanding. How about you just consider it a favor for her?\"\n\nNian Bing was slightly taken aback. Xue Ji was the proprietor of the Clear Wind Inn, yet he wasn't speaking with the tone of a command, but rather something closer to a plea. This alone was enough to show his good character, and Nian Bing's favorable impression of him grew immensely. He said respectfully, \"It's what I should do. You're too kind, Proprietor.\"\n\nXue Ji gave Nian Bing a deep look. Suddenly, with a flick of his wrist, he reached for Nian Bing's shoulder. Nian Bing didn't move; he only had time to register Xue Ji's hand—a fair and strong hand—before it was already on his shoulder. There was no pain. Xue Ji patted his shoulder and said, \"Alright, I'm leaving. You can continue learning with her.\" With that, he turned and strode away. Nian Bing didn't see the flicker of doubt in Xue Ji's eyes. From that brief test, he had clearly discovered that Nian Bing didn't have a single trace of fighting energy in his body. Xue Ji had always felt this young man was not as simple as he seemed, but he couldn't put his finger on why. As he walked out of the courtyard, he didn't close the gate.\n\nOnce Xue Ji had gone, Nian Bing turned his gaze to Xue Jing. She was patting her ample chest. \"That scared me to death! Good thing Dad seems to have been fooled by your looks. You idiot, who told you to speak just now? Would it kill you to keep your mouth shut?! Get back in here! Now we can continue our lesson out in the open.\"\n\nNian Bing returned to the room. This time, there was no need to continue with etiquette; they began learning to dance directly.\n\nAn hour later.\n\n\"Nian—Bing—\" When Nian Bing stepped on Xue Jing's foot for the fourteenth time, she finally lost her patience. \"I'm going to strangle you! How can you be so clumsy?! I've taught you so many times and you still can't get it.\"\n\nNian Bing dodged her hands, saying with an aggrieved tone, \"I've always been clumsy. Isn't it a bit late for you to be figuring that out now? Miss, it's still morning. You should have enough time to find a replacement.\"\n\n\"A replacement? A replacement, my foot! The outfit was tailored to your size, where am I supposed to find someone now? Wait here, I'll be right back.\" Glaring fiercely at Nian Bing, Xue Jing turned and ran out of the room. Watching her hastily retreating back, Nian Bing frowned slightly. \"That girl. If she had half her father's refinement, she'd be considered a real beauty. What a pity!\"\n\nBefore long, Xue Jing returned, an odd grin on her face. Her feet were making a clinking sound. \"There, that's better. Step on them all you want. As long as you keep stepping on my feet, you don't get to rest. We're going to keep practicing.\"\n\nNian Bing took a closer look and was shocked to see that Xue Jing had changed her shoes. She was wearing a pair of iron shoes. His eyes widened. \"Miss, don't you think that's a bit extreme? Aren't they heavy?\"\n\nXue Jing snorted. \"Of course they're heavy. But it's much better than you stepping on me all the time. I used to wear these for five years to practice my lightness technique. Each shoe weighs fifteen *jin*¹, so I'm practicing with you while carrying thirty *jin* of weight. You'd better take this seriously, you hear me?\"\n\nHaving just heard Xue Jing say he couldn't rest until he got it right, Nian Bing had already decided to get serious. Although holding a beautiful woman was a nice feeling, standing like this for so long was no easy task for a magician like him. He nodded helplessly and they resumed the dance practice.\n\nThe two of them continued practicing straight through to the afternoon, by which point Nian Bing had barely managed to grasp the dance steps. While he was far from graceful and fluid, it was just about passable to take the stage. They had even eaten their lunch in the room. Both Nian Bing and Xue Jing, who was wearing her thirty-*jin* shoes, were now drenched in sweat.\n\nXue Jing wiped the sweat from her forehead and plopped down on her bed. \"You've finally, barely, passed. Let's leave it at that. If we practice any longer, even if you can take it, I can't. Nian Bing, you rest for a bit too. Have some water first. Later, go take a bath and change into clean underclothes, then we should get ready to leave. This time, I'm going to find out, once and for all, if I have a place in his heart.\"\n\nLooking at Xue Jing's determined expression, Nian Bing suddenly felt a strange stirring in his heart. At this moment, Xue Jing seemed her most beautiful. Daring to pursue what she wanted was a quality Nian Bing greatly admired. \"Miss, if he doesn't get jealous, what will we do?\"\n\nXue Jing said irritably, \"Shut your crow's mouth!² I'm beautiful and charming, how could he not be interested? And if, by some chance, he really is a block of wood, I'll hold you responsible!\"\n\nNian Bing said innocently, \"I'm not him. What does that have to do with me?\"\n\nXue Jing waved her hand in frustration. \"I was just talking. In any case, I'll do my best and leave the rest to fate. If the gods haven't tied our strings of fate together, what can I do? Ling'er has it so much better. Her senior brother has been doting on her and loving her since they were little, so she never has to worry about this stuff. I'm about to die of frustration. Nian Bing, if only you were really a magician!\"\n\nNian Bing glanced at Xue Jing. \"If I really were a magician, what would be so good about it?\"\n\nXue Jing giggled. \"If you were, you could pursue me! A magician's status would be a match for mine, even if you were only an intermediate magus. To be honest, of all the men I've met, you're the most beautiful. Who knows, if you put on a dress, you might become an even greater beauty than Ling'er and me!\"\n\nNian Bing's skin crawled at her words. He gave a wry smile. \"Miss, using the word 'beautiful' to describe a man doesn't seem quite appropriate, does it? Let's go bathe now. I feel really gross.\"\n\nXue Jing's face flushed. \"Be clear about what you're saying! What do you mean *we* go bathe? Let's go. It's a good thing I had you change out of the magician's robe before we started dancing. It would have been a pain if it got dirty. Do you have any idea how expensive these magician's robes are?\"\n\nNian Bing thought to himself, *So that's it. In your eyes, I'm worth less than a magician's robe. It seems that in this society, without power, you are nothing. If I were just a commoner, I'd probably have no choice but to endure your insults. But I'm not. Xue Jing, you'd better remember every word you've said. Who would ever like a spoiled and willful young lady like you?*\n\nAs dusk slowly fell, a luxurious carriage traveled down the main street of Ice Snow City. The carriage was drawn by four tall, black horses. It was so large it could have easily seated a dozen people. Driving it was an old man with a peculiar posture. With a slight flick of his wrist, the reins in his hand would naturally tap the horses' backs, guiding their direction. He controlled the speed perfectly, not too fast and not too slow, as they headed toward the western part of Ice Snow City.\n\nInside the carriage, Xue Jing looked down at her silver gown with extreme discomfort. This kind of dress was different from what she usually wore; it was custom-made for a banquet. Underneath, there were three or four different kinds of stays and supports. It had taken three maids the better part of an hour to get her into it. For Xue Jing, who had always preferred simplicity, wearing such an outfit was pure torture.\n\n\"Nian Bing, do you think this dress looks good?\" Xue Jing subconsciously asked Nian Bing, who was sitting across from her.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said with sincerity, \"It's very beautiful. Your long brown hair with this silver gown gives you an air of nobility. It's much lovelier than your usual dresses.\"\n\nXue Jing's eyes lit up. \"Really? If it's really beautiful, then all this trouble wasn't for nothing. This dress is so tight! It's dreadfully uncomfortable. It's a good thing I'm not too heavy; I can't imagine the torture those plump ladies must go through to wear something like this. You have it easy. A magician's robe is the perfect attire for any occasion.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Well, I'm just an impostor anyway. Miss, if you're uncomfortable, couldn't you have just worn a regular dress? Don't you have confidence in your own beauty?\"\n\nXue Jing snorted. \"Of course I have confidence. But isn't today about testing that annoying guy? If it weren't for him, who the hell would want to dress like this? In the upper social circles of Ice Snow City, I'm famous for being casual. Oh, right. From now on, you can't call me 'Miss' anymore. If you call me that at the banquet, we'll be a laughingstock.\"\n\n***\n¹A *jin* is a traditional Chinese unit of mass, equal to about 500 grams or 1.1 pounds.

The Sunday highlight event is unchanged, still at the usual time.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"Then what should I call you?\"\n\nXue Jing thought for a moment and said, \"Since you're appearing as my boyfriend, you can call me Jing'er, just like Dad does. Consider yourself lucky. Also, you have to remember, when you talk to me at the banquet, don't be so respectful. You must seem more affectionate, so it's more believable and people won't get suspicious. Do you understand?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"I understand, Jing'er. Like this, right?\" As he spoke, he turned, sat down beside Xue Jing, and wrapped an arm around her slender waist, pulling her into his embrace.\n\nXue Jing was stunned for a moment. Then, she could clearly smell the masculine scent on Nian Bing. Looking up, she saw his handsome, chiseled features, so striking that for a moment, she didn't even realize how intimate their position was.\n\nHolding Xue Jing, a faint, cold glint appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. *Since you want me to be your boyfriend, I won't hold back.*\n\nAfter a moment, Xue Jing came to her senses. She struggled a little and said, \"Let go of me first. We're not at the banquet yet.\" Though she said this, her struggles were very faint. Nian Bing's warm embrace was actually quite comfortable.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"We're not at the banquet yet, but I think it's best we practice getting into character first. If we're too stiff, anyone with eyes will see right through it, won't they? Since we're putting on an act, it should be as realistic as possible.\"\n\nXue Jing was slightly taken aback. Staring at the handsome man again, she asked, \"When did you get so smart? In my impression, you're supposed to be a simpleton!\"\n\nA clear light shone in Nian Bing's blue eyes. \"That was just your impression, not who I am. I never said I was a simpleton, did I?\"\n\nXue Jing suddenly felt that something was amiss, but she couldn't put her finger on why. She huffed and said, \"You need to remember, you're only my boyfriend for one night. If you get any improper ideas, don't blame me for being harsh.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Improper ideas? I wouldn't dare. You are the young miss, and I am a servant. After tonight, we'll both return to our rightful places, back to our own worlds, won't we? Jing'er.\"\n\nLooking at Nian Bing's somewhat strange gaze, Xue Jing felt a flutter of panic in her heart for some reason. Just then, the carriage came to a stop. They had arrived at their destination.\n\nXue Jing swatted his hand away and took out a box from under her seat, handing it to Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing asked, puzzled, \"What's this?\"\n\nXue Jing said, \"Open it and see.\"\n\nThe box was red and felt quite heavy in his hands. As he opened it, Nian Bing immediately felt a wave of fire element aura wash over him. It was a fire-elemental magic staff. The shaft was dark red with spiral patterns, and the head was a round red gemstone of good quality. The fire element aura was very rich; it was likely the same grade as the Ice Spike Staff he had just acquired.\n\nXue Jing said, \"I borrowed this too. It's called the Fire Star Staff. Be careful with it. A fire mage ought to have his own staff.\"\n\nNian Bing picked up the staff and nodded. \"I won't break it. Selling me wouldn't even cover its cost.\"\n\nXue Jing paused, looking as if she wanted to say something, but held her tongue.\n\nThe carriage curtain was lifted. Following proper etiquette, Nian Bing alighted first, then extended his right hand to Xue Jing inside. She took his hand and stepped down from the carriage. The elderly driver steered the carriage to the side. \"Miss, I'll wait for you at the entrance.\"\n\nNian Bing looked up and saw a magnificent, palace-like building. Even from outside the gate, he could feel the grand and imposing aura of the structure within the courtyard. It was a large estate, surrounded not by walls, but by an iron fence. The fence was about three meters high, with sharp points on top, clearly designed to prevent climbing. Outside the five-meter-tall main gate, ten soldiers stood guard on each side, holding standard knight's lances. They stood there with an intimidating presence, clearly more than just ordinary guards.\n\nNian Bing remembered what Xue Jing had told him. The owner of this house was Ice Snow City's Minister of Finance, a man whose power was second only to the City Lord, the Marquis himself. He also held the title of Count. Today's banquet was being held for his daughter's eighteenth birthday, and the Count's daughter was good friends with both Long Ling and Xue Jing.\n\nXue Jing took Nian Bing's arm and said, \"Be careful what you say. Remember everything I taught you, understand?\" Her hand was very cold, and Nian Bing could feel it clearly even through two layers of clothing. It was obvious that Xue Jing was a little nervous.\n\nNian Bing, on the other hand, was quite relaxed. His expression was completely natural as he walked slowly toward the gate with Xue Jing.\n\nA butler stood at the entrance, collecting invitation cards from the guests. Upon seeing Xue Jing, he couldn't help but smile. \"Miss Xue, you've arrived. Our young miss has been waiting for you. Miss Long Ling should be here soon as well. This time, the three great beauties of Ice Snow City can finally gather together.\"\n\nXue Jing smiled. \"Uncle Li, you're teasing Xue'er again. What 'three great beauties of Ice Snow City'? That's just nonsense spread by idle gossips. If we're being serious, Ling'er and Rou'er are the real beauties. What am I?\"\n\nThe butler smiled faintly, his gaze falling upon Nian Bing. Nian Bing clearly saw a cold glint flash in the butler's eyes. If not for his own strong willpower, that gaze alone would have been enough to intimidate him into retreating. He gave the butler a slight nod and said, \"Hello, I am the fire mage, Nian Bing.\"\n\nThe butler smiled. \"No need to be so formal, sir. To have reached the rank of a High-level Mage at such a young age is truly remarkable. Since you are a friend of Miss Xue, you are naturally our honored guest. This way, please.\" He didn't ask any more questions; from Nian Bing's calm and composed gaze, he had already sensed his true strength.\n\nXue Jing didn't notice anything unusual and, arm in arm with Nian Bing, finally entered the courtyard.\n\nThe estate was enormous. In front of the massive, palace-like building was a giant magical fountain that could shoot water ten meters high. The fountain was surrounded by flowers of all colors, and the entire courtyard was covered in green vegetation, with dozens of large trees. Clearly, the master of this place had high standards for his environment.\n\nXue Jing seemed to let out a sigh of relief, whispering to Nian Bing, \"I guess we've passed the first hurdle. You don't know, that Uncle Li at the gate, even though he's just a butler, he grew up with the Marquis, and his martial skills are extremely high. He has the Marquis's complete trust. For banquets like this, he's always in charge of screening the guests. So far, no one has ever managed to sneak in under his watch. My father once told me that Uncle Li probably has the strength of a Martial Master.\"\n\nNian Bing thought to himself, *So this is how these great houses are. Even a butler is this formidable. It seems I'll have to be extra careful not to let my facade slip.* As he thought this, he subconsciously touched the Morning Dew Blade in his robes, his most reliable asset.\n\nAs they walked up to the entrance of the tall building, two servants immediately came forward to greet them and guide them inside.\n\nA somewhat strange voice suddenly rang out, \"Isn't this Xue Jing? Ah! You look completely different today! I never knew you could be so beautiful in a formal gown.\" The speaker was a woman of short stature, a good half-head shorter than Xue Jing. Though her features were passable, the passage of time had left crow's feet at the corners of her eyes. She wore heavy makeup, a sight that almost made Nian Bing want to throw up.\n\nThe woman walked up to Xue Jing with what she considered a graceful gait. Xue Jing frowned in annoyance. \"So it's Lady Meia. I didn't expect to see you here today.\"\n\nLady Meia laughed. \"Of course I had to come. Today is the Count's precious daughter's birthday, how could I miss it? Come, Xue Jing, let's go inside and talk. Oh, and who is this handsome mage? I don't believe I've seen him before.\"",

    "content": "Xue Jing snorted coldly and said, \"This is my boyfriend, the high-level fire magician Nian Bing. He has just come from outside. Of course you have never seen it. Sorry, Madam Meiya, we have to go in first, Rou is still waiting for me.\" After saying that, he pulled Nian Bing and walked in quickly, and ignored Madam Meiya again.\n\n\n\nAs soon as Madam Meiya's eyes fell on Nian Bing's face, she did not move. She had a fascinated look in her eyes, her lips buzzed, and she said something to Nian Bing. Nian Bing didn't even dare to listen. She immediately lowered her head and walked into the hall with Xue Jing. Such a disgusting old woman was still far away.\n\n\n\n\"Yinyu, who is that person just now? It feels so strange!\" Nian Bing couldn't help but say to Xue Jing.\n\n\n\n\"Strange? What's the point? She was a fan of an intercourse when she was young, but later she finally got married. After marriage, the viscount's family had long been gone and her family was not well off. Not many years ago, the viscount passed away after she fell ill and died. She had no intention of refusing her fucking silk and started her life of an intercourse. For decades, have you not seen so many fans on her face? It's just to cover up the patterns on her face. Her real age is probably over fifty years old, and it makes people feel disgusted after seeing it.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, and fell to Xue Jing's ears and said, \"Similar.\"\n\n\n\nThe heat in his ears made Xue Jing feel a little confused. He subconsciously shrank his neck and just asked Nian Bing. He remembered where he was now, but just glared at him and took back what he said. Nian Bing seemed to have not noticed it, smiled slightly, straightened his back and looked around. The surrounding environment is indeed good. The entire hall is over 1,000 square meters, and there are more than 100 guests. They are talking in groups of three or five. They look at their outfits, which is either rich or expensive. The entire hall is filled with a smell of powder. \n\n\n\n\"Nianbing, you can stay here for a while, and you can also eat something. If someone talks to you, you'd better not answer, just be arrogant. I'll go find Rou, she's birthday today.\" As she said, she pointed to Nianbing at the empty sand, and then walked up the stairs next to her.\n\n\n\nNian Bing walked to the sand and sat down. He picked up a glass of drink and drank slowly. This social scene merger was not what he liked, but just observed these people calmly. The Martian stick in his hand was placed on the table in front of him. He did not care too much about this kind of magic weapon of gold-level artifact.\n\n\n\nAt this moment, he suddenly heard the door shouting, \"Magic Masters Association, Miss Long Ling and Master Jiu are here.\"\n\n\n\nThey are here. Although Nian Bing had already guessed that they would come, she still couldn't help but feel a little nervous at this time. She quickly picked up the staff on the table and stood up, and walked to a relatively dark corner on the side.\n\n\n\nToday, Long Ling did not wear a magic robe, but a purple gift suit. The gift suit was very compatible with her, and she even showed her elegant and gentle personality. When she walked into the hall, she felt like she had a purple spirit.The dragon spirit's people were obviously much better than Xue Jing. When Xue Jing came in, most people just looked at her for a few times and continued to talk about their own things. Only a few of them took the initiative to say hello to her. But Long Ling is different. As soon as she enters the door, it becomes the focus of the whole scene. Almost everyone takes the initiative to greet her. She feels like the master here.\n\n\n\nWith a slight smile, a faint light appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. He knew that under this situation, Long Ling could not see him at all, and he was happy to be clear. Today I will see what this so-called upper-level precious tribe banquet is like. \n\n\n\nMr. Jiu was wearing his magic robe. Although there was no sign of identity on it, no one in the audience would doubt his strength. Although Mr. Jiu was not as handsome as Nian Bing, he also said that in the past, for a while, the two of them completely became the focus of the scene.\n\n\n\nAt this time, Nian Bing developed a different kind of similarity to himself. Since only two of them did not come forward to say hello to Long Ling and Shi Jiu, they could easily see each other. He was a young man with a figure similar to Nian Bing, but he looked more healthy. He wore a well-fitting white pants on him, like a knife. Although the cut-like face is not very handsome, it has a strong yang breath. It has a pair of black eyes and black length, which looks a little cold. She holds a knife in her hand. The knife is very short, and it feels nothing longer than my morning dew. The scabbard is also white, and it can come here with a knife. It is obvious that this man's identity is extremely extraordinary. Suddenly, a thought rose in Nian Bing's heart. This person wouldn't be the cool guy that Xue Jing liked.\n\n\n\nSoon, Nian Bing affirmed his thoughts. In the hall, only this person could match the description of Xue Jing. What made Nian Bing strange happen, and the man actually walked towards him. Although he was not walking fast, the hall was just like this, and it took Nian Bing a few steps to come to Nian Bing.\n\n\n\n\"Hello, my name is Yan Feng.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment. According to Xue Jing's description, he should be very cold. It would be right if the people were not close to him! How do you take the initiative to say hello to yourself? Although he thought so in his brain, he did not lose his gratitude. He reached out to hold on to him and said, \"Hello, I am Nian Bing.\"\n\n\n\nWith a relaxed hand, Yan Feng walked to Nian Bing and stood down, raised his little finger slightly, and naturally lifted the black that fell in front of him. After tucking it into his ears, he was filled with a shiny brilliance that could not be described, calmly gazing at Nian Bing. After a long time, a faint smile appeared on his lips, \"I didn't seem to have seen you before.\"\n\n\n\nLooking at the tall and cold Yan Feng, a strange feeling suddenly rose in Nian Bing's heart. Although he couldn't tell what this feeling was, he felt that there was some inappropriateness. \"I came to Ice City and joined the Magicians Association, so I haven't seen me before. It seems that you should be participating in this kind of social event often.\"\n\n\n\nYan Feng's eyes fell on Nian Bing's face and said coldly: \"It's not common, it's just that. I hate those women who are the same as they are.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing thought to himself, this guy must have something wrong with his brain, what cool thing to wear! He smiled and pointed at Yan Feng, no longer talking to him, Yan Feng did not open his mouth and turned his eyes to the scene.\n\n\n\nLong Ling finally got rid of the crowd of people, said something to his teacher Jiu, and ran up the building. Obviously, she should have been getting along with Xue Jing and that lady Rou. The departure of Long Ling was the atmosphere of the main hall again. The noble tribe continued to talk about what he was talking about. At this time, Master Jiu also became one of them. From his ecstasy expression, it can be seen that the noble tribe must have praised him well. With his heart and nature, under this praise, I am afraid that he would not even know what his surname was. Most of the precious tribes who come today are very young, of course, except for the previous Lady Meiya.\n\n\n\nThe cold Yan Feng suddenly opened his mouth again, \"The Earl has appeared.\" Nian Bing looked at him and saw an old man in his fifties walking down the building. The old man was wearing a Chinese uniform and was not tall. It looked like the whole person seemed to be similar to the one, like a big meat ball. As the fat body trembled, the stairs were down. The stairs were obviously very solid. With his weight, there was no movement. Nian Bing thought to himself that he was indeed the president of the capital city, and the delicious food must have been stuffed into his stomach. \n\n\n\nThe appearance of the Count made the chatter calm down for a while, and his eyes fell on the stairs. The Count walked to halfway up the stairs and stopped. His fat face filled with smiles, \"Welcome to the humble house. Today is the birthday of the little girl at the age of 18, and it is also the day for her to become a human being. Everyone should pay attention to it. If you eat, drink, play and play, you will be regarded as your home. If you have any bad hospitality, please see. Let's continue. I think the little girl is coming out soon.\" As soon as this was said, it attracted a lot of music and virtue, and the fat meat on the count's face became even tighter. He seemed very satisfied with this scene, walked down the stairs, took a glass of wine in his hand, walked with the young and expensive tribes, and started chatting.\n\n\n\nSeeing this scene, Nian Bing and Yan Feng both showed the same expression on their faces, and their eyebrows were full of disdain. The extravagant life of the nobles is indeed not what they like.\n\n\n\n\"Brother Yan, how much do you know about this count?\" Nian Bing asked in a deliberate way. He was not familiar with this place, and now Yan Feng was the only one who could answer his questions.",

    "title": "Chapter 19: The Wise Girl Luo Rou (Part 1)",
    "content": "The Featured Post Convention will be held tonight at 12:05 AM as scheduled. All are welcome to attend.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYan Feng said coolly, \"The Count's name is Luo Hao. While he can't be called incorruptible, he is quite capable. Under his control, the finances of Ice Snow City are managed so well that the annual tax revenue submitted to the Ice Moon Empire is no less than that of Ice Moon City itself. His greatest source of pride is his wonderful daughter. Although Luo Rou is only eighteen this year, she became famous ten years ago. At the age of eight, she participated in the Ice Moon Empire's triennial national academic examination and actually achieved the astonishing feat of taking first place, with a score that far surpassed the runner-up. She was known as a goddess-like child prodigy. As she grew older, her intelligence became more and more apparent. It is said that the reason this Minister of Finance can handle all financial matters so methodically is inseparable from this Daughter of Wisdom. Among the three great beauties of Ice Snow City, it is this youngest one, the Wise Maiden, who is considered the foremost. Luo Rou, the Wise Maiden; Long Ling, the Sorceress; and Xue Jing, the Madwoman. When the three of them are together, even the City Lord, the Marquis, gives them a wide berth.\"\n\n\"A madwoman? Heh heh, the name really is fitting. With her temper, that title is perfectly appropriate.\" Hearing the three women's nicknames, Nian Bing couldn't help but find it amusing.\n\nYan Feng's gaze fell upon Nian Bing. \"What? You know Xue Jing?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"I am her male companion for today, so of course I know her. What are Brother Yan's thoughts on her?\"\n\nA flicker of surprise showed in Yan Feng's eyes. \"I didn't expect you to be Xue Jing's companion. What thoughts could I have of her? I only know that her father, Xue Ji, is the biological brother of Xue Po, one of the Ice Moon Empire's three great marshals. That Xue Po is the head of the three marshals, renowned for his iron-fisted style. In any battle he leads, not a single enemy is left alive, which has earned him the title of the Iron-Blooded Marshal. Xue Ji is much more low-key than his elder brother, having only opened a restaurant called the Clear Wind Restaurant here in Ice Snow City. However, with his brother's prestige, no one dares to offend him.\"\n\nFinally learning of the Xue family's background, Nian Bing couldn't help but draw in a sharp breath. To be able to open such a large restaurant right in the center of Ice Snow City was truly no simple feat!\n\nAt that moment, gasps of amazement rang out, and everyone's gazes once again converged on the staircase. In unison, they began to chant two words, \"Wise Maiden, Wise Maiden, Wise Maiden...\"\n\nAt the top of the stairs, the first to appear were Xue Jing and Long Ling, who had gone up earlier. One in silver, one in purple, their form-fitting gowns accentuated their full and alluring figures. Standing together, Xue Jing appeared slightly more voluptuous; years of martial arts training had given her an air of health and vitality. Although Long Ling was a bit more slender, her gentle smile made her more readily approachable.\n\nMost of the men present were staring straight up, though this, of course, did not include Nian Bing and Yan Feng. Just then, a blue figure appeared between Long Ling and Xue Jing. She had long, blue hair that was slightly curled, flowing down her back as if uncombed. Her large blue eyes shone with a faint light. Without even seeing her face, just those eyes alone had deeply captivated Nian Bing. They were eyes full of wisdom, their depths like a divine pool in a secluded valley—clear, yet bottomless. In terms of looks, among all the women Nian Bing had ever seen, perhaps only Feng Nu could compare to her. However, this Miss Luo Rou looked much more delicate, with a hint of fragile beauty in her features.\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"No wonder Brother Yan said the Count prizes his daughter so highly. Seeing the Wise Maiden in person, I truly have my doubts whether she is the Count's biological daughter.\"\n\nYan Feng looked at Nian Bing, a rare, faint smile gracing his face. \"That, I do not know. But you had better not let the Count hear you say that, or he will be furious.\"\n\nThe two exchanged a look and a smile, and the distance between them closed imperceptibly. The Count had already moved to the foot of the stairs as the Wise Maiden, Luo Rou, slowly descended, flanked by Long Ling and Xue Jing. It wasn't until she reached the bottom of the staircase that Luo Rou stopped. With a slight smile, she bowed slowly to the crowd. \"Today is my birthday. Thank you all for gracing me with your presence. I am deeply honored.\"\n\nA melodious birthday song began to play, filling the entire hall with a harmonious atmosphere. A trolley was pushed forward by two servants. On it was a massive, seven-tiered cake, already lit with eighteen blue candles. The lights in the hall dimmed, leaving only the bright glow of the candlelight. All the guests, with the exception of Nian Bing and Yan Feng, began to sing the birthday song in unison. Luo Rou smiled gently, clasped her hands before her chest, and closed her eyes to make a wish. A moment later, when she opened her eyes again, a hint of a smile touched her lips. \"Jingjing, Ling'er, let's blow them out together.\"\n\nThe three women blew at the same time, and the eighteen candles were extinguished amidst a fragrant aroma. The lights in the hall brightened once more. The birthday ceremony was over. Luo Rou took the cake knife and made the first cut, slicing into the topmost layer of the cake. The blade emerged, coated in a layer of white cream. Luo Rou smiled and said, \"There are many guests here tonight, and I am not in the best of health. Might I ask a gentleman to come up and help me serve this cake? I do not have a male companion today, and I would like to dance the first dance with this gentleman.\"\n\nHer words instantly caused an uproar. All the young noblemen who considered themselves eligible shot their hands into the air, each scrambling to be the one chosen by Luo Rou.\n\nNian Bing glanced at Yan Feng. \"Brother Yan, are you not interested?\"\n\nYan Feng said nonchalantly, \"Not interested. If you are, however, I can lend you a hand.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Oh? Then I'll have to trouble Brother Yan.\"\n\nA hint of surprise appeared in Yan Feng's eyes. \"You're really going to go?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"And why not? A dance with the Wise Maiden would make my trip here worthwhile. Brother Yan, we should probably hurry, or I'm afraid Miss Luo Rou will have already made her choice.\"\n\nYan Feng gave Nian Bing a deep look and nodded. \"Alright, I'll help you. Follow me.\" With that, he strode toward the densest part of the crowd. A faint white combat aura emanated from his body. Every nobleman who came into contact with this aura stumbled aside. They were about to erupt in anger, but when they saw Yan Feng's icy face, they all restrained themselves. Yan Feng's actions immediately drew everyone's attention, including, naturally, Xue Jing's. At that moment, everyone except Yan Feng and Nian Bing themselves thought that Yan Feng was going to cut the cake for Luo Rou. The clamor instantly died down, and as if no one was willing to compete with him, a path naturally cleared without him even needing to use his aura.\n\nXue Jing's expression changed slightly. A large part of why she had come today was for Yan Feng, and now, seeing him about to cut the cake for her best friend, her feelings became complicated.\n\nLuo Rou watched Yan Feng walk towards her and smiled slightly. \"Young Master Yan, are you going to help me cut this cake? It would be my honor.\"\n\nYan Feng walked up to the cake, his gaze sweeping over the three women before nodding at the Count beside them. \"No, not me. A friend of mine. I hope Miss Luo Rou will give him this opportunity.\" As he spoke, he stepped to the side, and only then did the crowd notice the magician in the fiery red robes behind him. At his appearance, both Long Ling and Xue Jing let out a small sound of surprise, their eyes filled with confusion. When Luo Rou saw Nian Bing's handsome features and extraordinary air, a flash of brilliance also crossed her beautiful eyes. In an instant, Nian Bing became the focus of the entire banquet.\n\nNian Bing walked to Yan Feng's side, his gaze calm as he looked at the three women before him. He smiled. \"Miss Luo Rou, I wonder if I may be of service?\"\n\n\"No.\" Before Luo Rou could speak, Xue Jing cut in. The moment she shouted the word, she realized she had been too hasty. Feeling the questioning gazes of the crowd, she stammered, \"I—I mean his status is not high enough.\"\n\nYan Feng said in a cold voice, \"Xue Jing, the Madwoman. You truly live up to your name. Are you going to act mad even at Miss Luo Rou's birthday banquet? He is my friend. That alone is status enough.\"\n\nHearing Yan Feng speak, Xue Jing was rendered speechless. She shot Nian Bing a fierce glare and said no more.",

    "content": "There will be one more chapter before the 12:05 AM post-highlighting event. Everyone is welcome to join the event and to read this book.\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Nian Bing, as if completely ignoring Xue Jing's stare, kept his eyes on Luo Rou, who shared his blue eyes. \"May I be of service?\"\n\n  Although Luo Rou was just as puzzled, she lived up to her title as the Maiden of Wisdom. Facing this situation, she smiled faintly and said, \"Jingjing was just being a bit out of line. I apologize to you on her behalf, sir. At my birthday banquet, there are no distinctions of status. Every guest in attendance is a friend of mine. Please, sir.\" As she spoke, she handed the dining knife to Nian Bing.\n\n  With a single, simple sentence, the awkward atmosphere was immediately dispelled. Nian Bing walked to Luo Rou's side, gave her a slight nod, and said, \"Would you ladies please step back, to avoid getting any cream on you.\"\n\n  Luo Rou glanced at Nian Bing, then stepped back with Long Ling and Xue Jing. Nian Bing grasped the handle. Although it was a different kind of knife, his sensitivity to blades allowed him to clearly feel the essence of the dining knife. He glanced at the plates on the nearby serving cart. Yan Feng came to his side and handed him the first plate. Nian Bing smiled. \"This first piece, of course, is for today's birthday girl, the Maiden of Wisdom.\"\n\n  A flash of light, and before anyone—except for Yan Feng at his side—could see how he did it, a perfect slice of cake was already on the plate. What was even more bizarre was that the knife was clean, without a trace of cream. On the remaining cake, the cut was perfectly neat, the frosting completely undisturbed. Nian Bing handed the plate to the Maiden of Wisdom behind him. \"Please consider this slice of cake my birthday gift to you.\" \n\n  Even with all her wisdom, Luo Rou didn't understand what Nian Bing meant. Long Ling, standing to the side, couldn't help but ask, \"This is obviously Rou'er's cake. How can you call it your gift?\"\n\n  Nian Bing smiled slightly. \"Maiden of Wisdom, taste it and you'll understand. This is the only special piece of cake today.\"\n\n  Luo Rou's eyes met Nian Bing's. She was surprised to find she couldn't read this exceptionally handsome man at all. Taking a spoon from a nearby servant, she scooped a small piece of cake into her mouth. As she did, she noticed the cake seemed a bit firm. The moment it touched her tongue, she couldn't help but exclaim, \"Oh, it's so cool!\" The once heavy, rich cake now had a refreshing sweetness. The chilled cream and cake melted the instant they entered her mouth, and a sweet, cool sensation filled her senses, invigorating her. A faint blush crept onto her pretty, slightly pale cheeks.\n\n  Nian Bing smiled faintly. \"Well?\" Infusing the cake with ice magic seemed simple, but the precision required was crucial. Too little ice element, and the flavor would be inferior; too much, and the cake would become an inedible block of ice. Such flawless control was likely something only a mage with a chef's background, like Nian Bing, could accomplish.\n\n  Luo Rou's eyes flashed as she nodded at Nian Bing. \"Thank you, sir. I am very pleased with this gift. It's been a long time since I've tasted something I wanted to take a second bite of. I wonder, would it be possible for my two sisters to also sample this delicacy?\"\n\n  The nobles present didn't understand the meaning of their exchange, of course, but Luo Rou's words didn't sound like a pretense. For a moment, they all found themselves looking at Nian Bing with curiosity. \n\n  Nian Bing smiled coolly, a hint of aloof arrogance in his expression. \"I'm sorry, Miss Luo Rou. As I said, today, only you may taste this special gift.\" He turned back, and the knife became a blur of light. One slice of cake after another landed on the empty plates. Nian Bing would pause after every ten cuts, allowing Yan Feng at his side to hand out the plates. There were plenty of people in the crowd familiar with martial arts, and they could all see that he wasn't using any Dou Qi. He was achieving this effect purely through his polished knife skills and exceptional wrist strength. His control over his power was incredible; every slice was perfect and identically sized. It was just that, when the cake reached the mouths of the nobles, it tasted perfectly ordinary.\n\n  When Nian Bing took the final slice for himself, the entire seven-layer cake had been perfectly divided. There was one slice for every person, no more and no less. Considering each slice was identical in size, it was clear this had been precisely calculated.\n\n  Luo Rou, who had already eaten almost half of her cake, smiled at Nian Bing as he finished his task. \"I'm surprised, sir. You divided the whole cake in no time at all.\"\n\n  Holding his cake, Nian Bing walked up to Luo Rou and smiled. \"If it had been anyone else, they probably wouldn't have had the chance to dance with you, would they?\" At a glance, dividing the cake seemed a simple task, but for an ordinary person, it would have taken quite some time to cut over a hundred slices. In that time, the ball would have already started, and Luo Rou could have easily used waiting for the cake-cutter as an excuse to turn down dance partners. And once the cutting was finished, she could have simply found another reason to refuse. Such a clever scheme was truly befitting of the Maiden of Wisdom. Nian Bing had seen through her plan the moment she asked for help. This Maiden of Wisdom, though gentle and serene on the surface, was actually sharp as a tack. Her inner arrogance was something only another wise person could perceive. \n\n  Luo Rou knew he had seen through her intentions. The cake in her hand was half-gone. At that moment, the eyes of Ice Snow City's three great beauties were all upon him. Luo Rou's gaze was challenging, Long Ling's was full of curiosity and questions, and Xue Jing's was the most transparent—furious, but with a flicker of curiosity as well.\n\n  Luo Rou announced in a clear voice, \"Everyone, after you finish your cake, the dance floor is open. I will now fulfill my promise and have the first dance with this gentleman mage. Music!\"\n\n  Melodious music began to play. Luo Rou extended her right hand to Nian Bing. He smiled, took her delicate hand, and placed his other arm naturally around her waist, which was so slender it looked as though it might break. With a smooth glide, they moved onto the dance floor. The guests parted on their own accord, clearing the center for the pair. Though Nian Bing's dancing was a little rusty, he soon found his rhythm with the music.\n\n  Luo Rou's fragrance was subtle, yet it left a deep impression on Nian Bing—it was a scent reminiscent of orchids. Her hand, so soft it felt boneless, was incredibly comfortable to hold. They gazed deeply into each other's blue eyes. To an onlooker, it appeared to be a look of deep affection, but both Nian Bing and Luo Rou knew it was a look of challenge.\n\n  Luo Rou's cherry-red lips moved, and she spoke in a voice only Nian Bing could hear. \"Where are you from? I'm sure you're not from this city. People with golden hair are rare in the Ice Moon Empire.\"\n\n  Nian Bing smiled slightly and replied in an equally low voice, \"You're right, I only arrived in Ice Snow City recently, so of course you wouldn't have seen me before. I have long heard of the Maiden of Wisdom, and meeting you today, I see your reputation is well-deserved. It is truly my honor to dance with you.\" \n\n  A flicker of displeasure crossed Luo Rou's clear eyes. \"No need for such flattery. Why are you trying to deflect with these platitudes? Can you tell me who you came with? Yan Feng rarely associates with anyone, and he came alone today. I assume you two only just met. To get his help... you must have quite the personality, sir!\"\n\n  Nian Bing replied calmly, \"Perhaps Brother Yan and I just hit it off. It shouldn't be too hard for you to find out where I'm from, Miss Luo Rou. You just need to ask your dear sister.\"\n\n  For the first time, a flicker of genuine surprise appeared in Luo Rou's eyes, as if she'd just realized something. \"Don't tell me... are you the fake boyfriend who came with Jingjing?\"\n\n  Nian Bing said coolly, \"You really are close sisters. Since you already know, what's the point in me explaining?\"\n\n  A pensive look came over Luo Rou's eyes, while Nian Bing's gaze remained fixed and intense upon hers. Luo Rou knew that she had lost their first exchange, defeated by his mysteriousness. In her entire life, this was the first time she had tasted failure, and her understanding of the young man before her deepened considerably.\n\n  The surrounding guests watched the couple on the dance floor, most with expressions of envy and approval. The man was tall and handsome, the woman exquisitely beautiful—like a golden boy and a jade maiden.¹ Even Luo Rou's father, the old Earl, couldn't help but nod again and again in satisfaction. He had held many such social events, but this was the first time he had ever seen a man who could match his treasured daughter in both looks and bearing.\n\n***\n*¹ Golden boy and jade maiden (金童玉女): A Chinese idiom describing a perfect, idealized couple.*",

    "content": "This chapter is a little longer. On December 5th, the featured post event will begin on schedule, with over a thousand slots available. Please vote for and bookmark this book. Thank you.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs the music drew to a close, Luo Rou, guided by Nian Bing’s large hand, spun beautifully twice. Nian Bing’s right hand reached out and wrapped around her waist, causing her to lean back. At the same time, he stepped half a pace forward, his face close to hers, a faint smile in his eyes. He said in his normal voice, “Miss Luo Rou, your dancing is truly beautiful. Compared to you, I am quite unpracticed.” With a slight pressure from his hand, Luo Rou straightened up. She glanced at Nian Bing, her eyes full of charm. “You are too modest, young master. Though your dancing is unpracticed, you were completely immersed in the music. With a little more time, I would surely be no match for you. Now, esteemed guests, please, dance to your hearts' content.” After announcing the official start of the ball, Luo Rou took Nian Bing’s hand and walked toward the edge of the floor. She could no longer contain her curiosity and needed to ask her good sister for a clear explanation.\n\nXue Jing seemed to have forgotten all about Nian Bing. Standing beside Yan Feng, she asked in a low voice, “Aren't you going to dance?”\n\nYan Feng gave her a cold glance and said flatly, “Sorry, I don’t know how. And I certainly wouldn’t dance with a woman who just humiliated my friend.”\n\nSlightly angered, Xue Jing retorted, “Your friend? How long have you even known him? In your heart, is he more important than I am?”\n\nYan Feng glanced at Xue Jing with some impatience. “No, you're mistaken. He isn't just important—he's much more important.”\n\nHearing his first few words, a trace of joy had appeared in Xue Jing's eyes, but when she heard the last sentence, the color drained completely from her pretty, healthy-complexioned face, and she nearly fainted. “Fine. Yan Feng, you will remember this.”\n\n“Jingjing, come here. I have something to ask you.” Just then, Luo Rou's voice cut in at the perfect moment. Xue Jing turned and saw Luo Rou leading Nian Bing by the hand to the side of the room. The moment she saw Nian Bing, her anger flared. *Rotten Nian Bing, damn Nian Bing, you’re dead today,* she thought to herself. Forgetting the ladylike demeanor she had put on earlier, she strode over.\n\nShi Jiu had wanted to ask Long Ling to dance, but Luo Rou stopped him. Nian Bing smiled faintly. “Brother Shi Jiu, Ling’er, hello. I didn’t expect to see you here today.”\n\nLong Ling’s fine brows furrowed slightly. “I certainly didn’t expect it either! Nian Bing, you’re an ice magician. Why are you wearing a fire magician’s robe today? And the rank isn’t right, either. These clothes look a bit familiar.”\n\nXue Jing, who had just walked over, only heard the last sentence. She huffed, “Of course they’re familiar. I borrowed the clothes and the magic staff he’s holding from you for him, didn’t I?”\n\nLuo Rou looked at Nian Bing with confusion but didn’t speak. Long Ling’s eyes, however, went wide. “What? Jingjing, is this the wood…”\n\nSeeing no reason to spare Nian Bing’s feelings in front of her sisters after he had just embarrassed her, Xue Jing said viciously, “That’s right, he's the woodchopper. I didn’t expect him to be so full of tricks.”\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly. “Jing’er, I haven't played any tricks. I helped your friend cut her cake, which fits the identity of this costume, doesn't it? Don't forget, I'm your boyfriend right now. I know you all want to ask why my knife skills are so adept at cutting a cake. It's actually very simple. After chopping wood for so many years, my technique naturally became skilled. No matter what it is, chopping it is all the same.” He wasn't lying, so his expression was frank and open. Luo Rou, who had already formed a conclusion, began to doubt her own judgment upon seeing his candidness.\n\nXue Jing said angrily, “You… you did this on purpose, didn't you? Tell me, what did you say to Yan Feng just now?”\n\nNian Bing said calmly, “I merely greeted Brother Yan. He isn’t at all like you described. He’s very pleasant to be around.”\n\nXue Jing could no longer suppress the inferno in her heart. “Get out! Get the hell out of here! I'll deal with you when we get back.” Nian Bing's transformation and Yan Feng's coldness had completely enraged the mad girl.\n\n“Jingjing,” Luo Rou called out, somewhat displeased. After all, Nian Bing had just shared the first dance with her, making him the most important guest present. If Xue Jing chased him out, the banquet might as well end.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. “I'm sorry, Miss Xue Jing, but I did not sell myself to you as a slave. Everyone has their dignity; I hope you can be more mindful of your words. Besides, you have no authority to drive away a Great Magician. Am I right, Ling’er?” As he spoke, he turned his gaze to Long Ling, who was already frozen in astonishment.\n\nXue Jing’s voice became shrill. In her rage, she had forgotten her surroundings. “Great Magician? Are you talking about yourself? What do you think you are?”\n\n“Jingjing!” Luo Rou and Long Ling cried out in unison. Long Ling had come to her senses. Stepping between Nian Bing and Xue Jing, she said in a low voice, “Jingjing, no matter what conflict is between you two, today is Rou’er’s birthday. Don’t ruin the mood. Besides, Nian Bing is right. Given his status in our Guild, you truly don’t have the authority to make him leave.”\n\nXue Jing was stunned. “Ling’er, you really know him?”\n\nLong Ling nodded. “Jingjing, while I don’t know what misunderstanding you two have, there’s one thing I can confirm. Remember that new Great Magician I told you about who joined the Guild? That’s Nian Bing. He’s even younger than me but has already reached the realm of Great Magician. He has earned the deep respect of my father and several Magisters.”\n\nLuo Rou nodded, presenting her leftover piece of cake. “I can prove that point—with this piece of cake that’s just like ice cream.”\n\nXue Jing was stunned, utterly and completely stunned. She had never imagined that Nian Bing, who had always been exceptionally weak in her eyes, could be a genius magician. The sudden contrast was extremely difficult for her to accept, but she knew that Long Ling and Luo Rou would never lie to her. It was all true. Her gaze suddenly turned cold. After staring at Nian Bing for a moment, her emotions unexpectedly calmed. “Rou’er, I’m sorry, I can’t stay for the rest of your birthday banquet. I’ll come by another day to apologize properly. I’m leaving now.” With that, she walked toward the exit with calm, graceful steps. Luo Rou and Long Ling, who knew her well, understood that Xue Jing had reached the brink of a volcanic eruption. This matter would likely not end well.\n\n“Nian Bing, what on earth is going on?” Shi Jiu, who had been silent until now, couldn’t help but ask.\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly. “It’s nothing, just a small misunderstanding between Miss Xue Jing and myself. Brother Shi Jiu, amidst such beautiful music, aren’t you going to invite Ling’er for a dance?”\n\nShi Jiu paused for a moment but quickly understood. He gave Nian Bing a grateful smile and extended his right hand in a gentlemanly gesture. Long Ling had no reason to refuse him now. Although she still wanted to get to the bottom of things, she had to first glide onto the dance floor with Shi Jiu.\n\nNian Bing stood there peacefully, watching the pairs of men and women dance gracefully on the floor. He felt lighthearted. This time, he could finally leave the Clear Wind Pavilion for good.\n\n“Don’t you think that was cruel to Jingjing?” Luo Rou said softly, standing beside Nian Bing.\n\n“Cruel? I didn’t think so. Miss Luo Rou, you are known as the Wise Maiden. In your opinion, with Xue Jing’s temperament, shouldn’t she suffer a few setbacks?” Nian Bing turned to look at Luo Rou.\n\nLuo Rou frowned slightly. “So you’re saying you were actually helping her?”\n\nNian Bing said calmly, “At least, that’s how I see it. Xue Jing once helped me, and although I hid my identity as a magician from her, I bear her no ill will. To be frank, if she were a man, I might have truly retaliated for all the insults she has hurled at me these past days. But she is, after all, a woman, and there’s no point in quarreling with a woman. That’s why I chose today to reveal my identity. You may think I’ve hurt Xue Jing, but in truth, we can’t even be considered friends. She isn’t heartbroken, just furious. Do you think I care if one more person hates me? You are the Wise Maiden, and Xue Jing is your friend. If you can guide her to change her current temper and way of speaking, perhaps she’ll suffer fewer losses in the future.”\n\nA strange look appeared in Luo Rou’s eyes. “Who on earth are you? I really don’t understand your motive for doing all this.”\n\nNian Bing gave a faint smile. “I am just an ordinary magician. Didn’t you hear what Ling’er said? An ice magician who just recently joined the Magicians' Guild.”\n\nLuo Rou smiled. “Nian Bing, that must be your name. You’ve piqued my interest.” Like a mouse catching the scent of a cat, Nian Bing felt an involuntary shiver run down his spine.\n\n“Miss Luo Rou, if you wish to investigate my background, feel free to use any means at your disposal. I apologize for disrupting your birthday banquet today, but I am very pleased to have met the Wise Maiden. When there is an opportunity in the future, I will be sure to pay a visit. Please let Ling’er know that I’m heading back to the Guild. If she’s looking for me, she can find me in the library.”\n\nLuo Rou said, a little disappointed, “You’re leaving now?”\n\nNian Bing smiled warmly. “Even if I didn't leave, I doubt Miss Luo Rou would be willing to dance with me again. So, it's better that I go. I don't enjoy being the target of everyone's attention.”\n\nLuo Rou’s expression flickered. “Then will you be going back to the Clear Wind Pavilion?” She had wanted to say, *what would be the harm in dancing with you once more?* But the words, having reached her lips, remained unspoken.",

    "content": "This book will be going up for sale this week, probably on Tuesday or Wednesday. I hope everyone will add it to their collections and vote. Thank you.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNian Bing shook his head. \"Not right now, at least. But when I do return to the Clear Wind Abode, it won't be in my current capacity.\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled faintly. \"I'll grant you the win for today, but you can't win forever. Once I know everything about you, I'll make you lose so completely you'll have no choice but to admit defeat.\"\n\nNian Bing feigned a look of terror. \"I already admit defeat completely. Please, milady, don't make things difficult for me.\"\n\nLuo Rou snorted. \"Is it that you disdain to contend with a simple girl like me?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"I wouldn't dare. It's just that I truly don't have the time to contend with you, milady. If you have the means to enter the Magicians' Guild library, you can find me there anytime. For the next month, at least, I will not be leaving the Magicians' Guild.\"\n\n\"So, you're accepting my challenge, then. Very well. Let me see you out.\" Without waiting for him to object, she took his hand and began to lead him out through a side path.\n\nThe night was as cool as water, the air exceptionally fresh. Luo Rou led Nian Bing by the hand, strolling slowly along the courtyard path as if they were a pair of lovers. With a beauty by his side, Nian Bing felt relaxed and comfortable, yet he felt not a stir of lust in his heart. \"Nian Bing, how about we make a bet?\" Luo Rou said with a smile.\n\nThough she spoke casually, Nian Bing could sense the hidden challenge in her words. \"A bet? I'm sorry, but I'm not a gambling man.\"\n\nLuo Rou said, \"Are you afraid? Afraid you'll lose to me?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Trying to coax me is one thing, but goading me is another. When the Wise Maiden¹ uses such a tactic, I imagine few can resist. Why don't you tell me? What is this bet?\"\n\nLuo Rou said, \"Let's bet on this month. If, within one month, I cannot figure out your true identity, I lose. If I figure it out, you lose. How about it?\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Luo Rou. \"My true identity? Don't you already know it? I haven't hidden anything. How about this instead? Figuring out my identity is too difficult, practically impossible. Let's bet on my profession. As long as you can find out my true profession and provide convincing evidence, you win. But what shall we wager?\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled. \"Alright, we'll do it your way. So you're not just a simple magician. If I win, you must promise me one thing. Conversely, if you win, I'll promise you one thing.\"\n\nNian Bing said, somewhat amused, \"That's a rather vague condition, isn't it? If I were to win and demand that you marry me, would you agree to that as well?\"\n\nLuo Rou released his hand, and her laughter rang out like silver bells. \"That wouldn't be out of the question, either. But you'd have to beat me first. I have never lost a bet with anyone. I'll see you to here. I should be getting back; many guests are still waiting for me. We will definitely meet again. And don't you dare go back on your word if you lose.\"\n\nWatching Luo Rou's retreating figure, Nian Bing gave a helpless smile. He hadn't expected to just get rid of Xue Jing only to provoke such a big troublemaker. Luo Rou, the Wise Maiden, would be nowhere near as easy to deal with as Xue Jing. He truly hoped the month would pass quickly so he could leave this chaotic place.\n\nLost in thought, Nian Bing headed for the exit. The butler at the gate was gone, but the soldiers were still standing guard. Stretching his body and glancing at the sky, he realized he was quite tired today. Still, he decided he would read for a while after returning to the Magicians' Guild; he hadn't finished the last book from the other day. At the thought of reading, his spirits lifted. In the magical world of books, his mind would broaden, and time would pass more quickly. With this in mind, he quickened his pace. After leaving the courtyard, he got his bearings and started walking in the direction of the Magicians' Guild.\n\nHe hadn't gone far when the Tianhua Medallion he wore on his chest suddenly emitted a warm current. Nian Bing's heart skipped a beat, and he stopped in his tracks. The Tianhua Medallion was a treasure that would often warn him at critical moments of danger. Back when he encountered the Venomous Miasma Bees in the Peach Blossom Forest, its timely warning had given him just enough time to prepare a spell and survive the crisis. With no time for hesitation, a faint blue light coalesced around Nian Bing's body as he began rhythmically chanting an incantation, his eyes scanning the empty street ahead.\n\nThe Tianhua Medallion's warning was entirely correct. A skin-piercing current of air carrying immense pressure suddenly descended from the rooftop to his left, rushing toward his position. It was a familiar red glow. The moment he felt the attacking aura, Nian Bing knew who had come. By now, his incantation was complete. Just as he was about to cast the highly defensive fourth-tier Ice Prism Shield, a white light suddenly flashed from the side. The white light wasn't intense, but it was incredibly fast, arriving after yet striking first, intercepting the red light before it could reach Nian Bing.\n\nWith a soft *ding*, the piercing sound made Nian Bing's eardrums ache, and he instinctively retreated toward the wall. A white figure and a silver one landed on the ground simultaneously. The silver figure was, of course, the Mad Maiden, Xue Jing, just as Nian Bing had expected. The white figure, however, was surprisingly Yan Feng. When Nian Bing had left earlier, Yan Feng seemed to have gone to the washroom, so Nian Bing had departed without saying goodbye.\n\nYan Feng raised the short blade in his hand, white scabbard and all. \"Mad Maiden, you're at it again. As a practitioner of martial arts, to ambush a magician from the shadows... you are unworthy of your art.\"\n\nXue Jing's eyes were filled with fury as she glared at Nian Bing. \"So what if I ambushed him? What business is it of yours? Who are you to him that you feel the need to save him? Get out of my way. I'm going to kill him today.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned slightly. \"Xue Jing, I don't think the enmity between us runs that deep.\"\n\nXue Jing's eyes suddenly reddened. \"It doesn't? How am I supposed to face my sisters after what happened today? I'm asking you, since you're a magician, why did you come to our Clear Wind Abode to chop firewood? Why did you lie to me? Everything you did before was an act, wasn't it? It was all to deceive me, wasn't it? What grudge do I have with you that you had to scheme against me like this?\"\n\nNian Bing hadn't expected Xue Jing to take the matter so seriously. He frowned. \"Xue Jing, yes, I am a magician. But I went to your Clear Wind Abode to chop wood of my own free will. I had my own reasons. I never intended to deceive you about anything. You never asked if I knew magic, so how can you call it deceit? Could you please calm down?\"\n\n\"Calm down? I can't calm down! In front of so many guests today, most people saw that you came with me, but you ignored me completely and shared the first dance with Rou'er. What did you mean by that? Were you trying to make a point to me? You despicable villain, I'm going to kill you today.\" The red Battle Qi surrounding the longsword in her hand flared, a clear sign she was about to attack again.\n\nNian Bing suddenly felt an urge to laugh. He suddenly realized with clarity that a large part of Xue Jing's hatred for him was actually born from jealousy. The thought of the word \"jealousy\" made him laugh inwardly. Could it be that this headstrong girl, who had always looked down on him, actually had feelings for him?\n\nA red light erupted. The longsword in Xue Jing's hand was like a rainbow piercing the sun as it slashed towards Nian Bing. The sheer force of the attack made it obvious that she was using her full strength.\n\nA white screen of light rose from below, followed by a rapid series of crisp clangs. Nian Bing's vision blurred, and when it cleared, both Xue Jing and Yan Feng were five meters in front of him. Except now, Xue Jing's face was pale, and the precious sword in her hand was now only half its length. A short blade emitting a faint, cold aura was pressed against her long, slender neck. Killing intent radiated from Yan Feng's eyes as he spoke coldly, \"Mad Maiden, I don't care if you're mad. But if you try to kill my friend, don't blame me for being ruthless. Others may be wary of your father, Xue Ji, but I couldn't care less.\"\n\n\"Brother Yan, stay your hand!\" Nian Bing shouted, rushing over to them. As he got closer, he saw Xue Jing's gaze flickering between him and Yan Feng, as if she were completely unaware of the blade at her neck that could take her life at any moment. Tears rolled down her smooth skin, and an air of sorrow instantly filled the space. Suddenly, Nian Bing saw a strange look in Xue Jing's eyes—it was despair mixed with her anger and grief. His heart sank. *This is bad.* His reaction was lightning-fast. The instant he sensed trouble, he immediately reached out to grab Yan Feng's blade.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Wise Maiden (智女):** A title for Luo Rou, referring to her intelligence and cleverness.",

    "content": "Here is the second chapter for today. Xiao San will try his best to get another chapter out around 10 PM. Hehe, please add this to your collection and vote for it.\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Just as Nian Bing had predicted, Xue Jing closed her eyes and actually threw herself toward the short blade in Yan Feng's hand. Time was tight, and Yan Feng had no time to react. At this critical moment, Nian Bing's hand arrived. He grabbed Yan Feng's short dagger directly, and Xue Jing slammed right into the back of his hand. Fresh blood slid down Nian Bing's palm, dyeing Yan Feng's short dagger red. The dagger seemed to have a spirit of its own, trembling slightly as if excited. Xue Jing felt that something was wrong. When she opened her eyes, she saw the bright red blood dripping to the ground. She froze.\n\n  Nian Bing sighed softly, looking at Xue Jing with a hint of helplessness. \"Why must you do this? Can't you withstand even a small blow like this? Did you think about your family and friends when you threw yourself at the blade? Xue Jing, although you have the nickname 'Mad Girl,' madness has its limits. Life is a gift from the heavens. Everyone only has a few decades. Cherish your own life.\"\n\n  Yan Feng’s left hand tapped several times, sealing the blood vessels in Nian Bing’s wrist. He said coolly, “If she wants to die, just let her. Why did you have to save her?”\n\n  Nian Bing smiled faintly. \"Brother Yan, you're being too extreme. I've said that life is precious. Besides, she was just momentarily overcome by anger. Miss Xue Jing once helped me, yet I kept the fact that I was a magician from her. Consider this cut as me repaying her. Miss Xue Jing, from now on, I don't owe you anything, and you don't owe me anything. Please leave.\"\n\n  The bleeding had slowed, but it still dripped to the ground, drop by drop. The anger in Xue Jing's eyes had vanished the moment she saw the blood, replaced by a complex light. Biting her lower lip, she retreated step by step, then fiercely threw the broken sword in her hand to the ground, turned, and ran. In the pitch-black night sky, two strings of crystalline tears drifted.\n\n  \"Nian Bing, are you alright? My Frostflame Dagger is extremely sharp; I'm afraid it has already injured your muscles and bones. What should we do? The dagger can't be removed yet. I'll take you to a doctor right away.\" The earlier cold arrogance in Yan Feng's eyes was gone, and his concern was palpable. Seeing his worried gaze, Nian Bing suddenly felt a sense of unease. He quickly said, \"Thank you for your concern, Brother Yan. Don't worry, it's not as serious as you think. Your dagger is indeed very sharp; it even cut through the ice in my hand.\" As he spoke, he slowly opened his hand. Two pieces of blood-stained, solid ice fell to the ground. Although he had bled a lot, the wound wasn't actually deep. Xue Jing's charge had only just allowed Yan Feng's Frostflame Dagger to slice through the ice and break Nian Bing's skin.\n\n  \"Oh, spring of life! Please release your radiance, grant me the healing water that bears the mark of life, and relieve this pain. —Water Healing Technique.\" Blue specks of light condensed on Nian Bing's hand, flowing like threads toward the center of his palm. The bleeding stopped instantly. Under the effect of the blue light, the shallow wound could be seen healing with the naked eye.\n\n  Nian Bing smiled with satisfaction. \"Truly, 'a house of gold can be found within a book'¹! Yesterday's reading wasn't in vain. This second-tier Water Healing Technique is much more effective than the first-tier healing spell.\" This second-tier magic was something he had just seen yesterday in a water-element magic book at the Magicians Guild. Ice magic was derived from water magic; not only did its users possess the power of ice, but they could also be considered water magicians. However, a water magician could not use ice magic. This was why ice magic held a higher status than the ordinary four elements in the continent's magical world.\n\n  Yan Feng said with admiration, \"Magic is truly a wondrous thing. This healing art alone is something martial skills cannot achieve.\"\n\n  Nian Bing smiled. \"Thank you for saving me, Brother Yan. While magic has its advantages, martial skills also have their own unique strengths.\"\n\n  Where was Yan Feng's cold demeanor now? He laughed and said, \"Don't be so formal. Actually, I could already see you were prepared, but worry clouds one's judgment, so I couldn't help but step in. That mad girl is truly insane. To think she'd try to kill someone over such a small matter.\"\n\n  The feeling of unease in Nian Bing's heart grew stronger. He could already see something in Yan Feng's eyes. Forcing a smile, he said, \"Brother Yan, I have something to attend to, so I must return to the Magicians Guild.\"\n\n  Yan Feng seemed reluctant to see him go. \"Brother Nian, we are friends now. Can I visit you at the Magicians Guild in the future? Oh, right, you can also call me by my nickname. My... my nickname is Juhua. Yan Juhua.\"²\n\n  A chill ran through Nian Bing's entire body, but he couldn't refuse Yan Feng, who had just saved him. He could only fight back the urge to vomit and nod. \"Of course, you can. Brother Yan, until we meet again.\" After saying this, he gave Yan Feng a slight nod and turned to walk back towards the Magicians Guild. As he walked, he thought to himself, *Xue Jing, oh Xue Jing, of all the people to like, you had to fall for a 'glass' like him.³* At this thought, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a shiver run through him. It would be best if he never saw this Brother Yan again.\n\n  As he walked toward the Magicians Guild, Nian Bing's mind kept replaying the resentful look in Yan Feng's eyes as he left. A chill ran down his spine. Lifting his magician's robe, he saw a layer of goosebumps had appeared on his skin. No wonder that guy treated him differently from the moment they met. No wonder he wouldn't even give a beautiful woman like Xue Jing the time of day. It turns out he has that kind of disgusting hobby. Thankfully, he had noticed it early from the look in his eyes; otherwise, it would have been trouble if he got pestered. It was obvious that the guy's martial skill was very high. Unless he used the Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess combined with Ice and Fire Homologous Magic, it would be difficult to defeat him. Besides, he didn't have any ill intentions, so Nian Bing couldn't bring himself to attack him. For now, he just hoped he wouldn't come looking for him again. Otherwise, if others were to misunderstand, even jumping into the Tianqing River wouldn't wash him clean.\n\n  Walking slowly down the street, Nian Bing felt very relaxed. The matter with Xue Jing was finally resolved. Although it might be hard for her to accept, at least he had taken a blade for her. No matter how mad she was, she probably wouldn't resent him anymore.\n\n  The urgent sound of horse hooves suddenly rang out. Nian Bing quickly moved to the side. The street he was on wasn't particularly wide; it would be bad luck to get run over.\n\n  With two long neighs, a pair of fine steeds stopped in front of Nian Bing. He was surprised to find that the riders were Long Ling and Shi Jiu. The two dismounted. Shi Jiu said unhappily, \"I say, brother, how could you leave without even saying goodbye?\"\n\n  Nian Bing gave a wry smile. \"In that kind of situation, how could I not leave?\"\n\n  A touch of coldness had entered Long Ling's normally gentle gaze. \"Nian Bing, I need you to explain what happened with Jingjing.\"\n\n  Nian Bing forced a smile. \"An explanation? That's easy. You should also know that she was the one who asked me to pretend to be her boyfriend and accompany her to the gathering. Before I joined the Magicians Guild, I had just arrived in Ice Snow City and didn't know anyone. When I passed by the Clear Wind Pavilion and the Grand Achievement Restaurant, I was hoping to find a job to settle down, but I was given a hard time by some third manager at the Grand Achievement Restaurant. Xue Jing happened to pass by, punished that manager, and brought me into the Clear Wind Pavilion, letting me chop firewood temporarily. Perhaps it's because I'm decent-looking that she chose me to act as her boyfriend.\"\n\n  Long Ling was taken aback. \"It's that simple?\"\n\n  Nian Bing shrugged. \"It's that simple. You can ask Xue Jing if you don't believe me.\"\n\n  Long Ling's fine brows furrowed slightly. \"Making a Grand Magician chop firewood, how ridiculous. But, since Jingjing helped you back then, why did you embarrass her at the banquet today? Was it just because she asked you to pose as her boyfriend?\"\n\n  Nian Bing shook his head. \"I once told Luo Rou that I just wanted to teach Xue Jing a lesson. I can tolerate the insults she once directed at me, but I don't want her to continue like this forever. A self-righteous mad girl like her will suffer a greater setback one day. It's better that I provoke her a little. Besides, do you think my provocation was that severe? The one who actually revealed I was a Grand Magician was you, Ling'er!\"\n\n  Long Ling paused. Thinking back carefully, Nian Bing really hadn't done much. He had only cut the cake for Luo Rou and danced with her. It was Xue Jing who, upon discovering Nian Bing's true identity, had become furious and stormed out. At this thought, the light in Long Ling's eyes gradually softened. She nodded gently. \"Then, I suppose I really can't blame you. But, I want to know, have you ever considered Xue Jing a friend?\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **\"A house of gold can be found within a book\"**: A literal translation of the Chinese idiom `書中自有黃金屋` (shū zhōng zì yǒu huángjīn wū), which means that knowledge and education will bring wealth and success.\n2.  **Juhua**: The name `菊花` (júhuā) means \"chrysanthemum.\" However, in modern Chinese internet slang, it is a well-known euphemism for the anus.

    "title": "Chapter 20 Yan Feng’s Special Hobbies (Part 2)",
    "content": "Today's third chapter is here. Some book friends said that Yan Feng might be dressed as a man. I don’t deny it or confirm it here. However, the appearance of Yan Feng is just for a future burial. If you continue to watch, you will naturally know the mistress’s intention later. Yan Feng is just an ordinary supporting role, so everyone doesn’t have to worry about it. Nian Bing’s sexual orientation is normal. Of course, mistresses are also normal, hehe. I am only interested in beauty.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"Maybe, but I don't think I'll have many opportunities to meet her in the future. If Miss Ling finished her questions, I want to go back to the workplace. For a while, I think I won't leave the workplace. If Miss Ling is still dissatisfied, you can come to the library to find me at any time. Brother Nine, you are riding, then I'll leave first.\" After speaking, he turned around and continued to move towards the Magician Workers' Workers with a fixed pace.\n\n\n\nLong Ling looked at Nian Bing's back a little dullly and murmured, \"Brother, do you think I favored her because I am my good friend? Nian Bing is from a cold-hearted person. I think Jing Jing must have said something to him, which stimulated his self-esteem. However, I always thought that Nian Bing was a good person. He didn't seem to want to harm others, but was just carefully protecting himself.\"\n\n\n\nTeacher Jiu saw Nian Bing speak to Long Ling without any qualitatively, but he was secretly excited and agreed, \"Yes! I think Nian Bing is also quite distressed. He must have suffered a lot when he was a child. Xue Jing is really too crazy, and you can't just talk for her. Now there is a chance in the future. You have to learn more about her. Nian Bing is so hard that you don't have to worry about it. I think he is not a person who revenges. Things have passed, so forget it. It's getting late, so let's go back too. I'll take Nian Bing for a while.\" As he said, he urged to sit down and chase Nian Bing. \n\n\n\nNian Bing did not refuse the invitation from Shi Jiu. He did not take Xue Jing and Long Ling to heart. All he thought about was magic, only how to improve his strength. As for everything else, especially in women's problems, he did not consider too much. Only the wise woman Luo Rou's concession before he left the opening made him a little interested.\n\n\n\n  All the way, when they returned to the working meeting, it was already late at night. Nian Bing changed his big magician robe, and gave the fire magician robe and the Mars staff to Long Ling, and came to the library alone.\n\n\n\nIn the ocean of magic books, Nian Bing forgot everything. He even forgot that he should say hello to the girl in the monkey first. He didn't know how long it had been. Anyway, when the light outside the room was dim, the magic lights in the library would automatically light up. Nian Bing didn't read every book. He just read books related to the magic he had cultivated, as well as some basic knowledge of magic as a whole, which were what he needed the most.Especially a book about the basic production methods of magic rolling shafts, which allowed him to study for the longest time. Every time someone brings food in, Nian Bing's mind is devoted to the book, and he doesn't think who gives it. Anyway, as long as he hears the fragrance, he will look at it and eat it. This is the time.\n\n\n\n\"I'm so tired! I don't know how many days it's been.\" Nian Bing stretched out her waist, rubbed her a little ache, and stood up. In the first place, he finally finished reading all the things he needed. With his innate ability to remember, he imprinted everything he needed firmly in the sea of brain.\n\n\n\nI remembered too much and had never rested. Nian Bing only felt that his brain was drowsy. Although he longed to have a good sleep, he understood that the more he was in this situation, the more he should meditate and could not relax at all times. Magical cultivation was like sailing against the current, and he would retreat without going forward and without communicating with the magic elements for a long time. His magic power would inevitably gradually decrease. Thinking of this, he reluctantly cheered up, sat down on his knees, and began to sense the magical elements outside his body. Help yourself to regain your spirit through the Stone of the Ice Goddess and the Fire God. \n\n\n\nWhen Nian Bing woke up again, it happened to be during the day, and the sun shone on him through the windows of the library, bringing warmth. He knew that he had been meditating this time. Through a deeper understanding of magic, he had already learned a little more about his magical origin. He felt that the balance between his two magical powers was not stable, and he still needed a deeper fusion to achieve the true simultaneous origin of ice and fire, but what should be done is too far away. Ice and fire are two extremes. Now, due to the rotation, they will not affect each other. Once you break this balance by force, I am afraid that the first thing you can't bear is your body, let alone a deeper integration. Whether you can save your life will be a problem. It is precisely for this reason that although Nian Bing knew that as he continued to cultivate, his aura would become bigger and bigger, and the hidden danger would increase, he actually did not dare to try it easily. Now he just hopes that in the second and third levels of this library, or even the mysterious fourth level, can reasonably guide himself. Although his hope is slim, there are still some points.\n\n\n\nThe sound of the door rising, and Nian Bing looked up in consciousness. He saw Long Lingxing walking in with a plate. When he saw Nian Bing in a sober state, Long Lingxing couldn't help but be surprised, \"Nian Bing, have you finished meditation?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Have I been in for a long time? Is it the food you gave me these days?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling said a little displeasedly, \"You! It's a good thing to like reading books, but you can't read them all day and night! If my father hadn't let me slap you, I wouldn't have let you read them any longer. You just read books for three days and three nights, and then meditated for two days and two nights. I really haven't seen anyone like you, no wonder your magic has reached the realm of a great magician in the little new year. Let me eat something first. After meditating for two days, you will definitely be hungry.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing took the plate, which contained a bowl of white porridge, two croakers, and a small piece of stewed dish, and it was nothing more ordinary. But when he saw these foods at this time, he clearly felt that his heart was surrounded by warmth. Long Ling was a good girl, and he and she were just reluctant to be considered friends. She was actually so kind to him, and she would always have to give her a favor.\n\n\n\n\"What a stupid thing! Can you not get tired?\" Long Ling touched Nian Bing lightly.\n\n\n\n\"Ah! I'm hungry, of course I'm hungry, so I'll eat it now.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling finally saw the voracious swallowing in the past. Two bowls of porridge were completely dried up in less than thirty breaths. Nian Bing was also somewhat interested in pouring all the vegetables into his mouth and swallowing them. Only then did he pat his stomach with satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\"I'm not afraid of choking when I eat so fast.\" Looking at Nian Bing's appearance that she seemed to have not eaten a few pieces of food, Long Ling couldn't help but laugh.\n\n\n\nNian Bing also said to Long Ling, \"Thank you so much. I have already rested now. I think I should go to the second level to read the book.\"\n\n\n\n\"What? Do you still want to see? Don't you have a rest?\" Long Ling looked at Nian Bing in surprise.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"No need, there are more things I need to learn from the second and third levels. I finally arrived at this warehouse, but I was actually a little reluctant to leave.\" As he said, he was about to go upstairs.\n\n\n\nLong Ling grabbed Nianbing and said, \"Wait a minute. You know, I came to see you calmly yesterday. Also, Yan Feng came here too.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingmei had a slight head and said, \"What's the matter with them when they were looking for me?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling said, \"Yan Feng came when you were reading the book, the day after you came back. He looked at you at the door for a while. Seeing you so focused, he left quietly. When he left, he seemed to say that your focus was very attractive. He also said a few strange words, and I don't understand what it means, but it was the first time I saw his expression at that time.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"Okay, no need to describe it. Oh, by the way, Ling Er, what is this Yan Feng? It seems that no one in Ice City dares to offend him, even Miss Luo Rou's father, Earl.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling said, \"He! His identity is very special. From the surface, he is the seventh son of His Majesty the King of the Ice Moon Empire, and His Highness the Seventh Prince. However, for some reason, His Majesty the King of the Kingdom led him out of the Ice Moon City, allowing him to live in the Ice and Snow City, and specially rewarded his residence. Yan Feng didn't seem to love him much. In addition to practicing martial arts every day, he went to the streets occasionally and attended the banquet very few times. That day, he went to the banquet because he asked Rou to help him with a busy schedule. I think he seemed very special to you. This was the first time I saw him care so much about someone.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingyan sighed and said, \"It's better to care about this kind of concern, so why is Xue Jingyuan coming to me?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling said, \"Yin Jing seemed to have had a fight with someone, and it seemed that she was still hurt. She told me that a woman came to Qingfeng to find you. She and the woman started to fight with each other. As a result, the woman was very hurt. She injured her in a few tricks. Uncle Xue came forward to tell the woman that you had already She was willing to leave when she was not Qingfeng. She said calmly that the woman's strength was not inferior to Uncle Xue, and she seemed to have the ability of a martial artist. Jingqing let me tell you that the woman defeated Qingfeng, which was worth a total of 167 purple gold coins, so that you can pay it.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's whole body was slightly shocked, \"Ah! Could it be that she went to find me? It's really a death, why did I forget her? Ling Ye, I'll go out first, thank you for telling me these.\"",

    "content": "Today, this book is about to enter VIP. Everyone supports voting, thank you.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNo need to think about it, Nian Bing also knew that the big Qingfeng must be the Fengnian. Fengnian must have fought with Xue Jing because she never went there and had not found herself in Qingfengnian. Alas, she was so confused that she forgot everything when she saw the book.\n\n\n\nWalking out of the library, Nian Bing was anxious and wondering why, at this moment, his brain was filled with the graceful figure of the girl, and he could not be astonished as the world. He put on his ice stick and sang, \"A great ice and snow goddess! Please lend me your anger and send us to the lost shore.— Blizzard snow.\" The blue light spots scattered from the ice stick, and the air around it became much colder. The wind and snow were flying, and the four levels of blizzard snow became violent. Nian Bing completely merged his body and mind into the ice element, and flew high in the blizzard snow, rising into the air.\n\n\n\n  When flying with the wind and snow, the distance you can fly depends entirely on the level of the magician you are cast. The higher the magician you practice, the farther you can fly. With the magician's current magician's magic power, coupled with the effective control of magic, you can use the least magic power to help your body fly. It is not difficult to go from the magician to the water truck.\n\n\n\nFar away, Nian Bing had already seen the water-carrying ironware yard, and a group of red light was moving in the yard, like a red dragon. Although it was still far away, it could also feel the great atmosphere contained in it. Nian Bing controlled the wind and snow to descend towards the yard. It was getting closer. I miss Bing, the dancer was the girl. It was the first time he saw a girl practicing martial arts. He felt a little moved in his heart. He felt that the girl's fighting spirit was no worse than that of the original magician Hua Tian. The fighting spirit spread throughout the yard. The dark red light brought a burning airflow, which was still twenty meters away from the ground. Nian Bing felt the heat increase constantly, and the snowflakes that helped him fly were melting under this heat, and he was about to lose control of his body. \n\n\n\nThe wind and snow had a certain impact on the weather. The girl was practicing storm. Suddenly, she felt that the air around her was colder and the air became stronger. She looked up subconsciously and saw a blue figure in the air falling towards her. She was in a bad mood at first, so she would drink, \"Who is this?\" With a slight slight measure, he held the sword in his hands, took a step forward, with his legs, his back, his arms, and his wrists. A red flame squirmed upwards like a slashing the earth. In the sharp sound, the sword squirmed like the extension of the sword in his celestial world. The red light blade that reached one meter wide slashed directly at Nian Bing's body.Suddenly feeling the huge pressure coming from below, Nian Bing couldn't help but be startled, and could not explain it. In such a critical situation, he subconsciously took out the Morning Dew Sword from the dead. No, now, it should be called the breath of the Ice and Snow Goddess, and the cloth surrounding the hilt of the knife was on the large ice yuan. Under the influence of the ingredient, the blue light turned into ice powder, and Nian Bing could no longer chant spells. He grabbed a pile of paper from the sky and scattered it into the sky. Under the influence of the snow goddess's breath, the ten pieces of paper turned strangely into a huge ice net, an ice net made of ten ice skates interspersed. In order not to let the Snow Goddess breathe too much, when using it to induce the magic power attached to those papers, Nian Bing had to deliberately use his magic power to lay out a small boundary around the Snow Goddess Stone. Although this could prevent the Snow Goddess Stone from breathing out, the power of the ice net was greatly reduced.\n\n\n\n\"Explosion--\" The ice sabers hit the giant flame blade one after another. In the huge wave, the giant blade formed by the flame air was weakened a little while the continuous impact of the ice sabers, but the ice sabers were just a second-level ice magic. How could the power compare to the air-splitting atmosphere based on the Desert God Sword? Although the light of the fight weakened a little, it still came to Nian Bing. \n\n\n\nThe ten ice blades gave Nian Bing time. He dared not use the breath of the Ice and Snow Goddess to find the Fire God Stone from the Snow God and sang quickly, \"A great Fire God! Please allow me to borrow your left hand to let the flame descend into the people, snatch all evil powers, let the flame shine on the earth, and destroy all obstacles that block the front. - Fire God's left hand.\" Fire God's left hand is the weakest place in the whole body of Fire God, so this fire-type magic similar to the fire element is just five levels. If it is changed to the right hand of the Vulcan God, although it is only a word difference, the level is as large as the fourth level. The ninth level Vulcan God's right hand can easily destroy a heavy army of thousands of people.\n\n\n\nA huge hand of flame appeared in front of Nian Bing at the end of the spell. At this time, the red fighting spirit had already arrived in front of Nian Bing. The huge hand of flame directly met the fighting spirit, not the frontal counterattack. While the Fire God's left hand held the fighting spirit in the air, it suddenly took it to the side. Although the Fire God's left hand was the weakest part of the Fire God, it was actually the Fire God's. In part, although the five-level single magic is not the limit of the great magician, it is also close to the limit. Although the air-slashing atmosphere brought by the Destiny God Sword is extremely strong, it is still led by the Vulcan God's left hand and slid past Nian Bing. The Vulcan God's left hand opens his palm at the right time under Nian Bing's exquisite control, and does not use magic to consume the battle atmosphere, but stays in front of Nian Bing.\n\n\n\n\"Girl, don't move, it's me.\" Nian Bing shouted in a hurry.The fighting spirit that the girl from the God of Heaven was so terrible. The God of Fire just touched the side of the side and weakened one-third. If it weren't for the Stone of the God of Fire, these five levels of magic would have been destroyed. As Long Ling said, the power of the monk has reached the level of a martial arts family. How old is she! The Martial Arts are powerful warriors equal to those of the Demonic Instructor. \n\n\n\nThe girl below regretted this drama when she swept out. She was practicing the drama. When she was practicing until the moment she was excited, there were unknown flying objects coming towards her. She subconsciously split the sword with the drama. She only realized that the enemy was not clear, but her fighting spirit had already been released. Unless the martial arts had reached the realm of transformation, how could she take it back? The change in the air made her extremely surprised. Although the fight was blown out, it was still connected with her spirit. She clearly felt that in just a few blinks, ten ice blades first appeared in the air to block her attack. Then, a big flame hand dissolved her attack on the side. It was obvious that the other party was a magician, and the magician who reacted so quickly must be inconvenient. Even if she didn't hear Nian Bing's shout, she wouldn't continue to attack.\n\n\n\nUnder the protection of the Fire God's left hand, Nian Bing slowly declined. Due to the effect of the Fire God Stone, using this five-level magic did not bring him too much burden. He fell in front of the Fengniao with a thrilling heart, and said with a wry smile: \"I haven't seen it for a few days, you don't have to welcome me like this, that's going to die!\" When he landed on the ground, the huge Fire God's left hand also disappeared.\n\n\n\nAs soon as the red light flashed, he left the Heavenly God Sword and scattered. The girl had already come to Nian Bing's body, and looked at him carefully before saying relaxed, \"Who made you suddenly fall from the sky, and fortunately I didn't hurt you. When I was practicing the Sword, I was full of energy. As long as there was external stimulation, I would attack immediately. Most of them did not make a big mistake. If there was a door, I had to come from above. You, that's true.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing naturally wouldn't blame the girl. Looking at the intimate gaze in her eyes, she apologized: \"I'm sorry, it's all my fault. Girl, have you been to clear the wind?\"\n\n\n\nAs soon as Nian Bing mentioned Qingfeng, the girl couldn't help but hum and said, \"Don't mention Qingfeng. I'll go there to find you. I was very polite, but I met a tricky girl and said you were dead. I was so angry that I started to fight with her for the rest of my life. Her skills were not as bad as her mouth. If a middle-aged man hadn't come out of Qingfeng to explain to me later, I would have to teach her that day. Nian Bing, where have you been going in these days? I can't find it, and you won't come to see me. Could it be that I'll let you scold me?\"",

    "content": "At 6 p.m. tonight, this book will be available at a time, and the last chapter of the public will be updated at that time. Two chapters of VIP will be updated at the same time. Everyone is welcome to subscribe to this book.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNian Bing was asked by the girl of Feng and hurriedly said, \"No, no, I'm really blamed me.\" At that moment, Nian Bing briefly told the girl of Feng a few days ago. He didn't mention the things he had mentioned at the banquet, but just said that he had joined the Magicians Association.\n\n\n\n\"In this way, you are now a member of the Magicians Association of the Ice Moon Empire, or a great Magician. The magic is so attractive to you, I have forgotten it.\" Although the girl said this on her mouth, there was a little more smile on her pretty face, and she obviously didn't really think of Bing.\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"I have been practicing martial arts with my master over the years. I have been exploring magic and practiced my magic. This time, I finally found an opportunity, so I naturally devoted myself to it.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl seemed to remember something, \"Oh, by the way, you just seemed to have used two magics when fighting my attack. The first one was weaker, but it reduced the level of the fight attack. Then the magic you used was stronger, leading my fight to the side. However, I wondered that these two magics of you did not seem to be the same attribute. One ice and one fire, When I saw you using two magics at the same time, I thought your magic power was very low. Since no one pointed out, I had cultivated two magics. In the absence of high magic power, it did not affect your body. But now it seems that both magics of yours seem to have reached a strong level. It is hard to say, are you really a double-type magician of ice and fire? These two magics are completely opposite! \" \n\n\n\nNian Bing was shocked. Although he had a good impression of the girl, he still would not easily tell her secrets about it. He hurriedly explained, \"I am indeed of ice and fire, so I can practice these two magics at the same time. However, just like you think, these two magics are incompatible with each other, making it difficult for me to be higher. In order not to be backfired by it, you can only control your magic power to a certain extent. However, this is enough for me. Anyway, I am just a chef, and magic is only used to help cook art. Wong, I really didn't expect that your martial arts would reach this level. I think you should be almost as good as the martial arts master.\"\n\n\n\nA strange color flashed in the eyes of the woman. Looking at the sword of the Desert God with the sheath in her hand, she said, \"That's right. Nian Bing, I know you have some doubts in your heart. I want to know why I can achieve such a powerful power at such a young age, but I hope you don't ask. You just need to know that I don't have any maliciousness to you. When the production of the yang knife is completed, it is also the day when our separation is over. By then, you will leave the Ice City, and likewise, I will leave this water truck.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at the girl in surprise. When she first saw her, she noticed the mysterious breath on her body, but the mysterious silk was hidden very deeply, and he didn't want to go into it. At least he thought that the identity of the girl who was a disciple of Huatian would not be wrong. Otherwise, she would not be willing to help him in the fire god stone, but now it seems that things are probably much more complicated than he imagined. There are definitely many secrets on the girl's body, especially her powerful martial arts that are completely inconsistent with her age. Although the number of martial artists on the mainland is not as small as the demonic mentors, it will never exceed a thousand people. The martial artists in each country are the targets of the royal extreme pull. For decades, although the five great empires have been able to be at peace, the secret struggle has never stopped. The most important thing about this struggle is that it is reflected in two levels, one is a competition between warriors, and the other is naturally a competition between magicians. Although these are unofficial, the competition of the first martial arts competition in the whole world and the first magic competition in the whole world are something that no country can see. As long as you achieve outstanding results in the competition, even the overall strength of the entire country will be recognized by other countries. This competition of defeating others without fighting is obviously something that all countries want to see. In the mainland, the youngest martial artist was over 35 years old, and the young woman was about the same age as Nian Bing. If she was spread out, her young martial artist would have caused waves throughout the mainland. \n\n\n\nThe girl in the geese felt a little uncomfortable when Nian Bing looked at her burning eyes. She lowered her head and said, \"I went to find you that day, just to tell you that the quality of the Yang sword is much harder than I thought. It will definitely not be able to be carved in a month. Therefore, you still need to wait longer and conservatively estimate that it will take at least three months to carve the hilt. You are a magician, right? After the carving, I will go there to find you. You go back and learn your magic well. Actually, some abilities are always good for you. In fact, based on your physical condition, if you practice martial arts, you will achieve something in a while. Unless you are in a war, magic is simply incomparable to martial arts. Just like, if I continue to attack, you may not be able to support it. Of course, this is just one of my suggestions. If you just choose to practice magic just to be a good chef, it is obviously very correct.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Girl, it is precisely because you cultivate your energy and you can feel the strength of your energy. But I am different. I cultivate magic. Magic has its own secrets. If my magic power can be compared with your energy, I think your energy may not be what I do. What the magician needs is just the time to chant spells. Not bad, I cannot compete with your continuous attacks, but if I am a magician, when I use the eighth level magic, the power of the martial arts master will not be able to compete with it.Therefore, I have always believed that the difference between a magician and a warrior is mainly due to distance. When the same level of magicians and warriors are close, they must be the warriors who win. When the distance is far away, the magician has sufficient time to chant, so the warriors may be in danger. Of course, the best combination is naturally the warrior and the magician cooperate with each other, using the warrior to fight against the enemy's incoming warriors in front, and the magician uses appropriate magic behind it. This is both a method of fighting and the same is also a method of fighting, but the size of the combination is different. As you said, I am just a chef, and magic has been enough for me. If I get distracted from learning martial arts, in the end, there will be only one, and that will be nothing. \"\n\n\n\nAfter hearing Nian Bing's words, a burst of surprise appeared in the blue eyes of the girl, \"I didn't expect that what you knew was so clear, so I won't say much. It seems that you didn't prepare me to cook something delicious today.\" When I said that the desire in the girl's eyes was easy to see. She never forgets Nian Bing's cooking art.\n\n\n\nNian Bing helplessly opened his hands and said, \"As soon as I heard that you had gone to Qingfeng to look for me, I immediately rushed over and had no preparations. Otherwise, I'll go and buy something now.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl smiled and said, \"No need, I'm joking with you. Although the food you made is really delicious, I don't want to eat too much. Otherwise, when we are separated from each other, how can other foods satisfy me? Go quickly, your magician will go back to you. Don't come back in the past few days. Do what you should do. I will fight to complete the carving task within three months. I will naturally go to you and use your fire magic to help you. I think it's not too difficult to embed.\"\n\n\n\nThe understanding of the bird girl made Nian Bing feel a little touched. When talking to her, there was no need to explain too much. The two people often only needed a look to understand what the other party wanted most now. Understanding each other would bring lightness to the other party. The relaxed feeling made Nian Bing's affection for this mysterious girl. Since she came to the Snow City, she met four beauties. These four beauties had to discuss their impressions and their status in Nian Bing's heart. So, they would definitely be the first among women. Although she was a little mysterious, at least she did not have anything that Nian Bing was afraid of. Nian Bing even had two magical abilities at the same time and did not hide it from her. When she was with her, everything was so natural, as if she had taken off an invisible mask, which was the feeling that only between people could have.",

Everyone is welcome to subscribe and vote.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThe girl said nothing more and sent Nianbing to the door of the water truck, \"Okay, go. This is for you, if you encounter any intractable trouble in the ice and snow city, as long as you blow it, I will definitely catch it in the shortest time.\" She went on Take out a small flute and send it to Mianbing. The flute is about three inches long and is dark red in color. There are several holes of different sizes on it. The hollow carving seems to be a phoenix shape, with a style of ancient style. From the slight glitter on the surface, it is enough to prove its value. What's more, it still radiates a warm atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\"Let's take a look.\" The girl said with a smile.\n\n\n\nNian Bing sent the flute to his mouth and blew it lightly. He clearly felt it seemed as if a sharp sound came out of the flute, but his ears didn't feel it.\n\n\n\nThe woman said proudly: \"This flute is very precious. You have taken it. This is my family's item. I only have this one. It is not for you, but I will lend it to you at any time. When the yang knife is embedded, you still have to give it to me. It is not my stingy, but this is the only thing my mother left to me and cannot give it to others at will. It is blown by the flute. The sound is only heard by our tribe, oh, no, only those who have passed the special cultivation can hear it. \"When I said, the girl remembered what her mother said when she died. The mother told her that only when she met someone she really liked and was truly enough to trust her to end her life could she send out this flute. Thinking of this, her pretty face that could not help but burst out. \n\n\n\nThe faint fragrance from the flute made Nian Bing feel excited, \"Bird, I...\"\n\n\n\n\"Wait.\" The girl of Feng put her finger on her lips, \"Don't say anything, go ahead. We are friends, and we should help each other. Remember, it's just friends.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment, as if cold water was pouring her face. She had just woken up and looked at the erotic girl with a erotic look. Yes! Just a friend, let alone a situation. Now is not the time for you to pursue your relationship.\n\n\n\nNo longer using Fengxue, Nian Bing walked back to the Magicians' Association step by step. When he returned to the Association, lunch was over. Along the way, he held the flute tightly, his heart filled with the shadow of the girl, or perhaps because of the love of the girl. Since he arrived in Ice and Snow City, these things he experienced have always made Nian Bing's thoughts tight. Only when facing the girl can he relax his mind. After leaving the Ice and Snow City, he may forget Xue Jing, Luo Rou, and even the gentle dragon spirit. However, he knew that he had been in a long time and it was difficult for him to forget the girl.Her pink long, the moving trousers wrapped in her blue trousers, were all deeply imprinted in her heart. Bird girl, Bird girl, who are you? Clan member, you have ever said to Clan member. What special ethnic group do you belong to? My father once told him that at the end of the battle, many ethnic groups were destroyed due to the war, but these ethnic groups were somewhat devastated and spread all over the place, because there was no big difference between humans and it was difficult to divide them. Maybe, the chubby girl is one of these tribes.\n\n\n\n\"Nian Bing, you're back.\" The plain voice woke Nian Bing up from his thoughts. He looked up and saw that Long Zhi, who was wearing a green magician robe, stood in front of him nowhere. \n\n\n\nNian Bing hurriedly calmed down, stepped forward a few steps, and said respectfully, \"Hello, Mr.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi smiled slightly and said, \"It is a good thing to like to cultivate your body, but you shouldn't be too tired. If everyone in this meeting can advance to you, I won't have to worry.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"The president has been awarded that it is the first time since Nian Bing has seen so many magic books since she practiced magic. For Nian Bing, they are the biggest treasures. If you can learn to enter the treasures without hands, it takes some time to understand these theoretical knowledge. If Nian Bing starts late, you naturally need to learn more so that your future cultivation can be carried out more smoothly.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi was slightly taller and said, \"When you first entered the library, I didn't have much surprise. After all, any magician would need a magic spell that suits him. What surprised me was that the magic data in the first level took you several days, and it was enough to look at it from the basics. It is proved that you are a craftable material, and the first three layers of the library have been completely opened. Keep learning. If you don’t understand anything, come to me as much as possible. As for Qingfeng, you don’t have to worry about the matter on Qingfeng. I have a good relationship with Qingfeng’s owner. If I come forward for you, they will not be able to do so. It's hard for you. Since you are willing to practice your work, you can continue. I heard that you are ready to enter the second level of the library. I discussed with the library. She has been learning magic with me since she was a child. Like you, she is also an ice magician, from the second level of the library At the beginning, let her read the information in the library with you, and you can also discuss it with each other. Especially in terms of magic control, you can give her more guidance. You are of the same kind, and it is easier to get along with each other. Let her understand it by herself, which is better than me who teach her directly.\" \n\n\n\nNian Bingmei's head is a micro-neck. He is a dual-type magician. What he needs to see is not just ice-type information. If there is a dragon spirit around him, it will naturally be much more numb. But Long Zhi is the president of the Magicians Association of the Ice Moon Empire. He has said this and cannot refuse. He was moved and said, \"Chairman, that's fine. Let the ninth brother of the teacher be with us. It's always a bit inconvenient for a single man or a widow. Let's study and explore together, and the harvest should be even greater.I saw in a detailed explanation of the first level of magic basics that all kinds of magic are in common under certain circumstances. Although Master Ninth Brother practiced earth magic, if we learn it together, the effect should be better. \"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi's eyes showed a surprise. Of course, he knew best how attractive his daughter was. He arranged for Long Ling to study in the library with Nian Bing, so he naturally wanted to create some opportunities for Nian Bing, but he didn't expect that he would give up this opportunity. Is it hard to say that with his daughter's talent and appearance, isn't it any attraction to him? Although I thought this in my heart, I said, \"You think very thoughtfully, so that's it. As for other things, you don't have to worry about what you need, even if you tell the servants. I will send someone to the library every day. I hope you can make a breakthrough in a while. Ignoring Bing, you have to remember that magic power is the key to cultivating magic and the fundamental basis for casting higher-level magic. Don't be confused by too many spells and techniques.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi's simple sentence made Nian Bing feel suddenly clear in his heart. Yes, magic power is the real key to cultivating magic. His ice and fire magic is different from other magic. How can he truly integrate these two extreme magic powers together? And I can only look for this problem from the library. \"Thank you, President, I will definitely work hard to cultivate myself.\" After bowing to Long Zhi and walking, Nian Bing turned toward the library. \n\n\n\nLooking at Nian Bing's back, Long Zhi couldn't help but smile. At his age as old as him, his magical cultivation was much worse than his. I wonder how much surprise he could bring to him. After Master Jiu and Long Ling came back that day, they reported Nian Bing's situation to him, and confirmed that Nian Bing had chopped wood while cutting wind, which increased Long Zhi's trust in him a lot. At least, this proved that Nian Bing had nothing to do with the person he was looking for when the Ice and Snow Goddess was priested. In Long Zhi's eyes, Nian Bing is a talented magician who is good at learning. For such talents, he will naturally choose La Ju.\n\n\n\nWhen I came to the library again, Nian Bing went directly to the second level. The second level recorded the knowledge of various magic from the third to sixth level, as well as deeper magic explanations. He memorized the ice-type magic spells that he needed the most, so the first book he chose was the complete collection of intermediate ice-type magic spells.\n\n\n\nHalfway through a book, Master Jiu and Long Ling had already stepped onto the stairs. When Master Jiuyi came up, he took the initiative to say hello to Nian Bing, \"Brother, we are here.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing put down what he said: \"Brother Nine, Ling Er, you should start reading magic books too.\"\n\n\n\nTeacher Jiu said helplessly, \"I really don't know what Master thought. We must let us read the book too. We have long remembered the foundation of these intermediate magic. Nian Bing, what are the best introductions?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing sank her shoulders and said, \"I'm just here to the second level. I'm still reading the mantra. Since the president lets you come too, you can take a look, there will always be some help.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling's gentle gaze fell on Nian Bing and said, \"Have you seen the silence?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing slammed her head and said, \"I don't want to see her. You know, if she sees me, she is just sarcastic and not as good as not to see her.\"",

    "content": "The enhancement will start at 12.o5.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLong Ling said lightly, \"Although his temper is a little worse, he is still very good. Don't be satisfied with her, just like her. Nian Bing...\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing interrupted Long Ling and said, \"Chairman, let me discuss with you the method of cultivating magic control. I want to know, how do you usually practice the control of magic? \"\n\n\n\nLong Ling was stunned for a moment and said, \"Of course, he used some low-level magic, and then used his own mental power to control them to the level he wanted to achieve. How could you not be like this?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Of course not. In fact, there is no scheming of magic power. The main thing to cultivate is mental power. The mental power is not very effective and does not have much stimulation to the spirit. For example, when you control the most powerful magic you can perform, it will be difficult to make it reach the level you want, and can only do face attacks. In other words, if you can cast this magic, you should be able to control it. The reason why it cannot be controlled is not that you lack mental power, but because your spirit is not concentrated.\"\n\n\n\n\"Concentrate?\" Long Ling's eyes lit up. She had a very high talent in magic cultivation. After listening to Bing's simple point, he understood a lot and asked, \"But how can we make our mind completely concentrate? This always requires a method.\"\n\n\n\nOf course, Nian Bing couldn't tell her that the way to concentrate her mental power was to train her. She said helplessly: \"This is different from people. To put it simply, when you concentrate on God's observation, your mental power is concentrated. This requires various trials to find the most suitable method for your own cultivation.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling thought for a while and said, \"I understand.\" He took out a small magic wand from the bottom of his mind, said nothing more, walked to a corner and made it down, and looked at the stone on the wand with great concentration.\n\n\n\nNian Bing secretly complained in her heart. Although this direct observation was more lustful than his hatchet cultivating method, it was undoubtedly the most suitable for dragon spirit. However, the cultivation of mental power cannot be completed overnight. It took him eight years to achieve his current achievements.\n\n\n\nTeacher Jiu saw Long Ling sitting down on the side, looking at Baoshi with a focused expression, and couldn't help but be stunned. He didn't hear what Nian Bing said before. At this time, he saw Long Ling really tried as Nian Bing said. He couldn't help but feel a little funny. He sat down next to Nian Bing and said in a low voice: \"I heard from the teacher that he originally wanted to let Ling Ling come to the library to repair the bookstore with you, was it me who you took the initiative to call me?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said in a low voice: \"Don't let you misunderstand me, brother!I guess I'll stay in the library for a long time. Don't worry, go after your spirit. When I read my book, what if I give you a single opportunity to stay alone? Brothers are here. \"\n\n\n\nMaster Jiu stretched out his thumbs to Nian Bing, and the excited expression in his eyes could not be concealed. \"Good brother, if you have any need, even if you tell your brother, I will definitely help you.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"No, now, brother, I'm going to read the book, I can't see anything else.\" After speaking, he stood up with the book, walked to another bookshelves, and continued his learning process. Master Jiu stood up and sat down next to Long Ling, followed her to look at the stone on the magic wand. \n\n\n\nIn the ocean of books, time always passed quickly. For a few days, Master Jiu was able to endure loneliness and accompany Long Ling here, but he was dispersed by nature and was not very interested in magic cultivation. Otherwise, he would not be nearly thirty years old and still stayed in the realm of a high-level magician. After a few days, except for the two words Long Ling and Nian Bing said while eating, both of them were always in silence. This situation made Shi Jiu very unsuitable. By the third day, he could not bear it. Except for occasionally coming in to take a look, he would never stay here for a long time. Anyway, Minami Bing and Long Ling were like Mutou. Master Jiu trusted Nian Bing very much. On the seventh day, he simply stopped coming and let the two of them practice in the library.\n\n\n\nNian Bing holds a book in one hand and quickly condenses magic power, and constantly carves a picture on a roll. This magic roll is made of special materials, with a layer of stone powder formed by crushing magic stones. Through magic carving, magic power can be stored on the roll. Once it needs to be used, it can complete the moment and eliminate the process of chanting the mantra. The more than ten pieces of paper that Nian Bing threw out when fighting against the attack of the girl in the Fengwo that day were the primary magic scroll he learned in the first level. That kind of second-level magic can be painted with ordinary paper. Four levels of magic require this special rolling axle to be painted. The price of this white rolling axle is also different depending on the quality. The cheapest one costs one gold coins, while the most expensive one requires ten purple gold coins. The white rolling axle itself is not very valuable, but if the magic required is drawn above, the price will immediately turn upwards in times of multiples. The rolling axle used by Nian Bing at this time is the most ordinary rolling axle worth a gold coin. Although the Magician Association has many preferential policies for its members, the rolling axle requires the members to buy it themselves. Nian Bing was originally a little curious about the use of rolling axle, but at the girl of Feng, he relied on rolling axle to save himself, which made him curious about rolling axle. After memorizing the needed mantras and seeing the knowledge he needed, he learned the engraving and use of rolling axle in this second level. He bought the white rolling lane directly from the trade association. Since he is a member of the trade association, the price can be 20% off. Only two days, Nian Bing bought more than 90 low-level white rolling lane at one time has been used at this time, and his half-month salary disappeared like this.However, his aura is not bad. Due to his high magic control power, his success rate in painting axes is much higher than that of ordinary magicians. Among the more than 90 scrolls, he has produced more than thirty four-level scrolls, and even six five-level scrolls and two six-level scrolls. This is the limit that Nian Bing can reach now. \n\n\n\n\"The last pen.\" The ice-type magic power condensed, and Nian Bing pointed his finger at the most important part of the rolling axle. With a chirping sound, the blue light flashed on the rolling axle, and it turned into a group of ice powder and was wiped out.\n\n\n\nThe massive overdrawn mental power made Nian Bing a little tired and leaned helplessly on the bookshelf. \"The success rate of these six magic rolls is really low, and I'm wasted a coin.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's already very good.\" A cry of voice came from behind. Nian Bing turned around and saw that Long Ling had arrived next to him. Squatting down, Long Ling looked at the completed rolls on the ground and couldn't help but smile, \"If every magician had a high success rate as high as you, then we magicians would have long become the richest organization in the mainland.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned and said, \"The book just says that whether painting a magic scroll can be successful is related to the magician's magic power, magic control, enlightenment of magic, and the axes' good fortune. So far, what is the success rate? Spirit, is my success rate really high?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling smiled and said, \"Of course it's very high. Generally speaking, a magician can only draw a magic roll that is two levels lower than the highest level of magic he can use, and the success rate is generally around one percent to five percent. A good white roll cannot increase the magic power on the roll, but it only increases the chance of success when drawing the roll. . With that most expensive rolling axle, the chance of success is only 20%. In addition, the size of that rolling axle is small, so the price is so high. Therefore, the successful magic rolling axle is very valuable even if it is only four levels. A four-level wind snow like you are worth at least fifty to one hundred. What about gold coins? You used a total of 100 rolls and you got more than 30 four-level ice magic rolls. That is to say, you can get at least ten times the profit of the rolls. Do you think? What's more, you also used this most common white rolls to create several five-level and six-level rolls. Six-level magic should be what you can The highest level you have reached, even such a roll can be made, even my father cannot do it. Every level of magic level, the price of rolling axle is calculated at five times. In other words, your rolling axle can be sold at tens of purple gold coins, and your rolling axle of six can be sold at a high price of two hundred purple gold coins or more. \" \n\n\n\nNian Bing heard the dragon spirit and couldn't help but smile, \"Why did I say this? Haha, Ling, how did you know that I have made the fifth and sixth grade rolls?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling's pretty face was red and said, \"I have noticed you when you start making rolls. Making rolls is more dangerous. I don't want you to destroy the library.I really didn't expect that your magic control is much stronger than I thought. I'm afraid that ordinary magicians are not as good as you. Otherwise, it would be so easy to succeed if you roll. \"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"It's useless for me to roll so many laps. If you like it, I'll give you a few. You can choose it. Unfortunately, I don't have enough magic power. Otherwise, I really want to make high-level laps to use. With rolling laps, when I meet an enemy, I'll throw it over. Even a high-level warrior may not feel very comfortable.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling burst out laughing and said, \"You're okay. You know, throwing the rolling axle is just like throwing money! When it comes to rolling axle, I remembered that last time, Uncle Lizan was surrounded by your wind and snow because he was careless for a while. In order to lose face, he used a seventh-level magic rolling axle. It was painted in front of him with the help of my father. If he got it outside, he could sell at least 3,000 purple gold coins. He didn't know how much he felt sorry for him after you left. The rolling axle was the cost, so he spent more than 200 purple gold coins.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at Long Ling in a silence and said, \"Is the magic roll really so worth it?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling looked at Nian Bing with a monster-like look, \"Now I really believe that you have never learned magic properly before. The magic rolling is not only worth the money, but has always been unmarket. After six levels of magic rolling, it is even more ten times the price. You should know, A seventh-level magic roll can easily destroy the city gate without any defenses, and an eighth-level ripple can destroy a thousand-man soldier in an instant. At the ninth level, the magic power that a roll can release can almost destroy a whole ten-man army. Think about it, How much does it cost to build a 10,000-level ramp? The value of eight-level ramps is at least 10,000-pink gold coins, and an eight-level ramp attacking a magic ramp requires 50,000-pink gold coins. As for the 9th-level ramps, there is basically no price. Moreover, it hasn't happened for a long time. My father was able to cast ten levels of magic while singing spells for a long time. He had tried to make nine-level rolls, but he never succeeded. In this regard, he had already spent thousands of purple gold coins to buy white rolls.\" \n\n\n\nAfter hearing Long Ling's words, Nian Bing suddenly realized that the main reason why magic rolls are so valuable is that any magic roll, even in the hands of a junior magician, can snatch the magic power attached to the roll. In this way, as long as you have money, a junior magician has several ten rolls on his body, and can even compete with a magic commander. This is the advantage of rolls. However, when Long Ling said that these rolls he made can sell a lot of money, and when he needs money in the future, he will do some.\n\n\n\n\"It's a pity that my magic power is still low now, and I can only reach the sixth level at the highest. I can't use this much rolling lap. Spirit, can you tell me if the president can help me sell some?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling smiled and said, \"Selling? Dad won't be able to sell it when he sees so much rolling.He will definitely stay by himself. You should know that as a magician craftsman, there are many reserves for the ripple. In the battle between magicians, or the battle, the power of the craftsman can greatly enhance the power of the craftsman. Even if it is just a four-level magician craftsman, it is good to collect more. Nowadays, there are very few people who make rolling axles like you in the industry. After all, the success rate of rolling axles is too low. In order to improve the success rate, everyone generally uses better rolling axles, which consumes a lot. That's it, I'll answer you for dad. The trade fair will provide you with all the resources for free as long as you need it, but you have to sell the amount you make to the trade fair at half the market price. You will be left with you as much as you want. I guess with your current magic control, if you use the best white rolling axle to do the four-level rolling axle, the success rate can reach more than 80%. I suggest you write more high-level scrolling, which will make your swing bigger. Long-term scrolling will greatly improve the control of magic power. However, people like me who have a success rate of almost zero cannot afford such expensive methods. \"\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nRecommend two new books for everyone to see.\n\n\n\nOne is \"The Song Dynasty Weekly\" by Dai Xiaolou, and the other is \"The Tenth Jersey of the Fans\" by Fans.

    "content": "The \"Featured Post\" selection event will begin promptly at 12:05. Everyone, please post in the short review section, not the discussion forum. Don't get it wrong, only posts in the short review section can be featured. At the same time, brothers, don't forget to vote for Xiao San¹ with your recommendation tickets. Of course, VIP tickets would be even better.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNian Bing now had a rough understanding of how precious the scrolls were. He smiled and said, “I accept your proposal. In any case, the resources I use are all provided by the Guild. Without the materials in the library, I wouldn't have been able to make the scrolls either. How about this: all the scrolls I make, aside from those I need for myself, I will contribute to the Guild. I don't want a single cent. However, I hope the Guild Master can grant me one privilege. If I should ever need money, I hope the Guild can provide a certain amount, within a set limit. Would that be acceptable?”\n\nLong Ling was stunned for a moment. “I… I didn’t mishear you, did I? You don’t want money?”\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, “What use do I have for so much money? It’s too troublesome to carry around, and besides, my expenses aren’t high.”\n\nLong Ling let out a cheer, suddenly hugged Nian Bing, and gave him a firm kiss on the cheek. “That’s wonderful, truly wonderful. Nian Bing, did you know? Because of the Ice God Pagoda's existence, our Ice Moon Empire's Magician's Guild has never had any standing on the continent. Not only are powerful magicians scarce in the Guild, but our various reserves are also far less than those of guilds in other empires. In the eyes of the Ice Moon Empire's imperial family, only the Ice God Pagoda is the symbol of the empire's magic; we're considered nothing at all. As a result, the funding allocated to us is pitifully small. Father has been constantly worried about these things. I really don't know what kind of monster you are. You know, even when Father makes these low-rank scrolls, his success rate is far lower than yours. Right now, at least half of the Guild's expenses are sustained by the scrolls Father makes.”\n\nNian Bing touched the spot where Long Ling had just kissed him and said in surprise, “No way. An empire's Magician's Guild has to be maintained like this?”\n\nLong Ling said dejectedly, “That’s the reality of it. Our Guild is different from the guilds in other empires. The guilds in other empires have the full support of their entire empire. Ours used to be the same, but as the Ice God Pagoda's influence grew larger and larger, the Guild received less and less recognition from the imperial family. The funds allocated to us are pathetically small; now, it's almost just a symbolic amount. Oh, Nian Bing! With you making scrolls from now on, the entire Guild's situation will improve. This is wonderful, thank you so much. Father can finally stop working himself so hard. Did you know? Father is only in his early fifties this year. Uncle Xue, Jingjing's father, is already over sixty. In terms of cultivation, Father is clearly much more powerful than Uncle Xue, but because of the years of toil, he looks even older. Nian Bing, thank you. You are the Guild's hope! You should continue reading. I need to go tell Father this good news. Can I take a few of the scrolls you made?”\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, “Of course you can, please, help yourself.” He had known Long Ling for some time, but this was the first time he had seen her in such an excited state. This, of course, was not just for the Magician's Guild, but more importantly, for her father.\n\nLong Ling joyfully picked up several scrolls from the floor without even checking their rank and immediately ran out, disappearing down the stairs in the blink of an eye.\n\nWatching her departing figure and feeling the warmth on his cheek, Nian Bing muttered to himself, “What a lovely girl. So scrolls are such a good thing. Hmm, I’ll leave the ordinary ones for the Guild, and keep the high-level ones for myself. If I accumulate more scrolls, traveling the continent in the future will be much easier.”\n\nHe did not continue making scrolls. More than ten days had passed, and he had basically finished reading all the knowledge he needed on the second floor. There was only one last book that interested him. Once he finished this one, he could enter the third floor to learn even more about magic.\n\nHe casually picked up the book he had long since chosen from the pile of scrolls and slowly opened it. The title of the book was *An Introduction to Magic Arrays*.\n\nA magic array is a method that uses special symbols and magical fluctuations to connect with and efficiently utilize the magical elements of the world. Under certain circumstances, magic arrays are something every magician must understand, especially high-level magicians. This is because only by properly utilizing magic arrays can a magician fully unleash their abilities, using the least amount of energy to cast the most powerful magic.\n\nAfter reading this passage, Nian Bing’s interest was instantly piqued. He had chosen this book because of its connection to making magic scrolls; the patterns drawn on the scrolls were, in fact, based on magic arrays. That being the case, if he could learn more about magic arrays, perhaps he could create his own unique magic scrolls. That way, their power could be expanded infinitely.\n\nMagic arrays were a profound field of knowledge. Even with Nian Bing’s intelligence, when he saw one complex symbol after another, along with their relationships and various functions, he couldn’t help but feel a bit lost. There weren't many magic symbols, only a hundred or so, and each had its own function. However, when one magic symbol combined with another to form a new one, their function would undergo a massive change. These changes were precisely what gave Nian Bing a headache. With over a hundred symbols combined in various ways, the number of new symbols created would increase exponentially. Under these circumstances, how could he possibly memorize them all?\n\nIt was a thick book, over a thousand pages long. Drawn in by the allure of magic arrays, Nian Bing quickly became immersed. At this moment, he had even forgotten that he was also a chef. The mysteries of magic had left him deeply captivated. Magic was indeed a wondrous thing, its inner substance far greater than what the outside world perceived.\n\n“Nian Bing, could you stop for a moment?” A gentle voice startled Nian Bing from his state of studying magic arrays. He looked up to see that, at some point, Guild Master Long Zhi and Long Ling had appeared beside him. He hurriedly stood up and said, somewhat embarrassed, “I’m sorry, Guild Master. I was too engrossed.”\n\nLong Zhi smiled. “It’s alright, this is very good. I’ve already heard about your situation from Ling’er. Could you make a scroll for me to see now? I really don't understand. Although your magic power is already considerable, there is still a significant gap compared to mine. Why is your success rate so high when making scrolls?”\n\nNian Bing shrugged helplessly. “I don’t really understand that either. I’ll make one, then. You are an authority in the world of magic; perhaps you can find the key to the problem. Unfortunately, I’ve used up all my blank scrolls.”\n\n“No matter, I have some here.” As he spoke, Long Zhi took a small scroll from his robes and handed it to Nian Bing, smiling. “This is the most expensive type of blank scroll, worth ten purple-gold coins. It can increase your chances of success when making scrolls. Give it a try.”\n\nThe moment the small, three-inch-long scroll was in his hand, Nian Bing immediately felt the difference. Rich magical elements suffused the scroll. He carefully unrolled it. The white paper surface shimmered with a crystalline sheen, something his one-gold-coin blank scrolls could not even begin to compare with. Nian Bing did not hesitate for long. His devotion to magic spurred him into action. With a gesture of his right hand, the surrounding air instantly grew cold. He did not immediately begin inscribing the array on the scroll. Just as he had observed the grain of the wood when splitting firewood, he carefully observed the ten-purple-gold-coin scroll before him, his eyes flashing with divine light, searching, searching for a gap in the energy fluctuations.\n\nFinally, after just a few breaths of observation, Nian Bing’s right hand moved. His wrist seemed to have broken as it moved in a blur across the scroll, lines of magic power condensed from ice elements continuously carving onto the narrow surface at a speed that was almost impossible to follow. A fifth-rank Ice Wall spell was completed in the span of a few blinks. As Nian Bing’s final finger tapped the scroll, a ring of blue light radiated outward. At its widest point, the halo of light suddenly contracted, and just like that, a fifth-rank scroll was successfully created.\n\nLong Zhi sucked in a breath of cold air. “Heavens! Is that how you draw a scroll?”\n\nNian Bing roused himself from his immersion and looked up at Long Zhi, smiling. “Guild Master, this kind of blank scroll is truly excellent. With the kind I was using before, I’d probably need ten to succeed with one. What do you think? Is this Ice Wall scroll acceptable?”\n\nLong Zhi gave a wry smile. “Nian Bing, it’s a good thing I’m not yet old enough for my eyes to be failing me. No wonder you have such a high success rate. Did you know? It takes me at least an hour to draw a single scroll, yet you only used a few short breaths. That is the difference! I imagine you haven’t been exposed to magic scrolls for very long. Why are you so fast when you draw them? Aren’t you afraid of making a mistake? You must know, the magic arrays on scrolls demand extreme precision. Even the slightest error will ruin the entire scroll. When Ling’er told me earlier that you had already finished a hundred scrolls, I couldn’t believe it. Now, it seems you truly are a bona fide magic genius!”\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. “I told Ling’er that when cultivating magic, if you want your magical control to become more precise and powerful, then concentrating your spirit is the best method. Before I draw a scroll, I first run through the entire form of the magic array in my mind. By observing the blank scroll, I find the best place to start and directly merge with the blank scroll's magical aura. That way, it can naturally be achieved in one go. When your spiritual power is completely focused, it’s simply impossible to make a mistake drawing a scroll. Even the blank scrolls I wasted before were only because my magic power failed to connect at a critical moment.” He couldn’t, of course, tell Long Zhi that his right hand was extremely precise due to years of practicing his knife work, which was why he could draw with such confidence. Even if Long Zhi wanted to draw scrolls better, he probably wouldn’t waste eight years chopping vegetables or splitting firewood.\n\nLong Zhi looked up to the heavens and let out a long sigh. “A genius, a true genius. Nian Bing, the most correct thing I've done in my entire life was marrying Ling'er's mother. And the second, I'm afraid, was accepting you into the Guild. I hereby declare that from this moment on, you are officially an elder of the Guild, enjoying all the same rights as the other elders. Whenever you need it, you may use your special insignia to withdraw all the funds possessed by any Guild branch.”\n\nNian Bing had already guessed Long Zhi would say this. After all, magic scrolls were too important to a Guild, especially one in the current situation of the Ice Moon Empire's Magician's Guild. What they needed most was someone exactly like him; it would be strange if he *didn't* try to win him over.\n\n“In that case, it would be disrespectful of me to refuse. Guild Master, I also have a declaration to make. From now on, any scrolls I create, aside from what I need for myself, will all belong to the Guild. I only hope that the Guild can provide me with some higher-quality blank scrolls. That way, my success rate will be even higher. It’s a pity my magic power is still weak. If I could make some seventh or eighth-rank scrolls, it would be even more beneficial for the Guild.”\n\nLong Zhi smiled faintly. “There is plenty of time. The cultivation of magic power cannot be rushed. You don't need to be in a hurry to draw scrolls, either. Focus on learning everything you need first. Rest assured, whenever you need them, the Guild will do its utmost to provide you with the highest-grade blank scrolls. Of course, I also hope you can produce more fifth and sixth-rank scrolls.”\n\nNian Bing thought to himself, *With this specialty of making magic scrolls, I can be considered to have found my footing in the Guild. It's a shame that this Magician's Guild's strength is so far inferior to the Ice God Pagoda's. Otherwise, with just a little incitement, I might be able to stir up a conflict between the Guild and the Ice God Pagoda. Even if it was just in secret, it would be very advantageous for my future plans.*\n\nLong Zhi was in high spirits. He had originally wanted to invite Nian Bing to a meal at the Clear Wind Pavilion but was turned down by Nian Bing on the grounds of continuing to study magic arrays. Indeed, for Nian Bing at this moment, nothing was more important than studying magic arrays, because, in the detailed explanations, he had seen something extremely beneficial to his cultivation of the Ice and Fire Homologous Origin.\n\nThe days passed one by one. The thousand-page book on magic arrays took Nian Bing a full seven days to finish completely. He didn't just read; most of his time was spent on comprehension. He didn't focus on studying the changes after the symbols were combined. Instead, he worked to fully understand the unique properties of each of the one hundred-plus fundamental symbols. This was because he had a sudden realization during his studies: although the combined symbols were fluid, the one hundred-plus fundamental symbols were static. The characteristics displayed by the combined symbols were all changes brought about by the effects of these fundamental symbols. Therefore, as long as he could thoroughly understand these fundamental symbols and grasp some of the rules of their transformation, it would be equivalent to mastering all the foundational knowledge of magic arrays.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Xiao San* (小三) is the common nickname for the author of this novel, Tang Jia San Shao.",

    "content": "The ban has been lifted, and the 12.o5 sequel meeting starts at the 12.o5 time. Please give me a brief comment area, don’t go wrong. At the same time, brothers, don’t forget to vote for the mistress. Of course, it’s better to have VIP votes. Hehe.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nWhen Nian Bing closed the book, he remembered what he said at the beginning. Ten years of practice and ten years of enlightenment. Yes, this sentence can also be applied in any field. The word enlightenment makes his learning of magic suddenly become clear. Perhaps, it is better for ordinary people to understand this after ten years of research.\n\n\n\nLong Ling was with Nian Bing's side and continued to cultivate his mental power according to the Nian Bing's method. However, the current cultivation has no longer been focused at the beginning. Long Zhi gave her a very important task, which is to take care of Nian Bing's daily life and meet all his needs. So, she hadn't cultivated for a while, so she would take a look at Nian Bing.\n\n\n\n\"Have you finished watching?\" The airplane was led down, and Long Ling raised her head to look at Nian Bing who was standing up.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"I think we can go to the third level now. Although I can't apply the knowledge there, I hope I can get some special things from it. If it can be used on the magic roll, then the roll I made will have some characteristics that other rolls do not have.\"\n\n\n\nWhat did Long Ling hear from Nian Bing's words? \"What do you mean is that you can improve the magic rolling shaft? However, the method of rolling shaft has been passed down for thousands of years, and no one can change it yet!\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"That's because his predecessors lacked innovative ideas. I think I should be able to do it. Although it's just just entering the door, as long as I give me a certain amount of time to study it, I will definitely succeed.\" Through his understanding of magic weapons, he has understood many things. Application and understanding are two different things. Even if he doesn't look at the method of making magic slides, he can imagine the accurate drawing and production principles of magic slides at a higher level. This requires the word \"intellectual\".\n\n\n\nSeeing that Long Ling seemed to be a little confused about himself, Nian Bing lowered his waist and picked up a piece of paper from the ground. Yes, a piece of paper with magic symbols. He sent the paper to Long Ling and said, \"What can you see from this?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling followed the white paper, only seeing some uncomplexing symbols painted on it, with a slight brow and said, \"This seems to be a painting of axle. However, from the perspective of complexity, this should be a two-level axle! What does this mean?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"What you said is, this is a roll, a low-level magic roll. However, there is a little you said it is wrong. It is not a two-level magic roll, but a one-level. Don't be surprised, is it a bit complicated as a magic roll, and its complexity makes sense.You look at it. \"After speaking, he took the rolling shaft from Long Ling's hand, and with one swipe, the white paper disappeared instantly under the stimulation of the light blue ice magic power, and an ice horn appeared in the air and shot towards Long Ling. This kind of attack magic will naturally not cause any harm to the dragon spirit. Long Ling raised his hand and also showed up an ice horn to meet it. According to common sense, the two ice horns would also form a group of ice powder. However, what Nian Bing does is something that can be judged by common sense? \n\n\n\nTwo similar ice pellets collided, and the ice powder was indeed produced. However, just when Long Ling thought it was over, an ice blade suddenly shot out from the ice powder group, and it was already in front of her in the blink of an eye.\n\n\n\nLong Ling was shocked. At this time, she was no longer able to use magic, so she could only lower her head and try to hide. Nian Bing smiled slightly, and swept his hand, the ice saber rolled out an arc and landed on his hand. \"How is that? Do you understand?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling looked at Nian Bing and gradually woke up from surprise, \"This, what is this?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"This is the result of my research. It's good. On the surface, it's just a one-level roll, but in this roll, two magics, ice horn and ice blade art, one level, and one level two level. If you are confused by the first level of ice horn, you will inevitably be injured under the second level of magic that comes later. I just want to prove a principle in front of you. Of course, what the predecessors left behind are It's precious, but if we don't have better innovation, then we can only stay in the stage of our predecessors. What I want to tell you is that I have developed a magic method that can cure many magic. Although it is not mature, imagine that if I can combine a fifth-level and a sixth-level magic into a roll, then when it comes to fighting the magician, the power it can even destroy a magician.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling stared at Nian Bing with her eyes widened. She could not understand what the young man's brain in front of her was. For the first time in the past, someone had such a sarcastic idea. The first time this research came out, although Nian Bing was still a great magician, his achievements were no less than a magician. As long as his research was successful, the status of the Magicians of the Ice Moon Empire on the mainland would definitely be greatly improved. \n\n\n\n\"Nian Bing, how did you do it? You actually succeeded.\" Long Ling looked at Nian Bing with something more. After all, no matter what kind of woman she is, she will always be attracted by accomplished men.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"In fact, this is nothing. Let's go. We should go to the third level. After I have perfected this research, I will teach you some methods of making rolling shafts. Unfortunately, this rolling shaft is so difficult to make, and you need to add a more word than an ordinary rolling shaft. Even I have only successfully created the one you just saw.At the higher level, it requires greater mental and magical support. However, I always feel that there should be some secrets in it. Now I am just typing up two magics on a roll. If they can be organically combined together, the effect will inevitably be completely different. Put away the rolls on the ground and hand them over to your father. I have only made ten five-level rolls and four six-level rolls these days. In the third level, I think I still need to further study the magic sphere, and I will continue to make the rolling shaft after I have a better method. \"As he said, he headed towards the third floor of the library.\n\n\n\nNian Bing naturally won't say all the thoughts in his heart. In fact, he can now create a higher-level fusion magic roll. He used white paper to try various fusion methods. Although the power of magic is different, the principle is the same. As long as the trial can be successful at low-level magic, then high-level magic will definitely be successful.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's figure disappeared at the corner of the stairs. Long Lingying sat down to the ground with a little silence, looking at the one in front of him: \"Why? Why can he see what is living in these dead books? Why can't I? What a magic genius, in front of him, I am just a child.\" She felt intimately that in the near future, Nian Bing would inevitably cause a great shock in the magic world. At that time, he would be an immortal existence in the magic world, and he was the first person to witness this existence. \n\n\n\nNian Bing's research is extremely painful. The pain is due to his own requirements for himself. Since he entered the library again, he has not left for nearly a month. When he is tired, he will use meditation to rest. Once his spirit recovers, he will immediately continue to study and learn. The various magical knowledge collected in the third level is much greater than he imagined. Nian Bing First, I memorize all the mantras in my brain, and then I began to study magic weapons. The production of ripple is secondly. The ripple is actually an external object. No matter how many ripples are done, I will always have a day of use. It is far away and cannot match my own strength. Magic ripple is actually only used by those weak people, and the real strong ones do not want to be this. The reason why he studied so hard was that the magical aura may be the key to opening the secrets of the same origin of ice and fire! The secret of the same origin of ice and fire is Nian Bing's greatest interest.\n\n\n\nThe research continues, and Nian Bing doesn't know that in order to support his research, Long Zhi has ordered the entire library to be blocked. Except for Ling Yan who can send him food and serve his daily life, no one is allowed to enter. This order was issued after Long Zhi learned that Nian Bing had developed the fusion magic. While he issued the order, he also made up his mind to keep Nian Bing in the trade fair at all costs, not to keep his people, but to keep his heart. Only by leaving his heart can the Magicians Association of the Ice Moon Empire become stronger.The third floor of the library clearly shows that it is different from the first and second floors. The first and second floors have dozens of large book shelves, while the third floor has only four, each of which has only a hundred books, and most books are already very old. The magic spells of each system are all complete from the sixth-level magic to the nineth-level single magic. Although he can't use it now, he still memorized it carefully. \n\n\n\n\"Nian Bing.\" Long Ling's voice sounded, making Nian Bing sober from research. Even he himself didn't know that it was the third day in the library.\n\n\n\n\"Spirit, what's wrong? You seem to have been missing these days.\" Nian Bing put down the one in his hand.\n\n\n\nLong Ling smiled slightly and said, \"It's not that I'm not that there are fewer people, but that you are too focused and have never paid attention to me.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled a little embarrassedly, \"Maybe, since I entered the library, I have paid less attention to other matters. Ling, do you have something to ask me for?\" He knew that if there was no special thing, Long Ling would not have interrupted himself.\n\n\n\nLong Ling smiled slightly and said, \"Of course there is something wrong. Someone came to the trade fair to find you. Do you want to see me?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned, \"Look for me? Who is it?\" Could it be Xue Jing or Feng Nu? It wouldn't be Yan Feng's guy.\n\n\n\nLong Ling saw what he meant from Nian Bing's strange expression and smiled and said, \"Don't worry, it's not Yan Feng. Although he came again, he was beaten by his father on the grounds that you were closing meditation, and he didn't come again. It turns out that a man is beautiful and it's also a bit of trouble, hehe.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said unhappily: \"Don't use the word \"beauty\" to describe me. Of course, you should use handsomeness and style as a kind of charm, and I don't object.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling stuck out her tongue at Nian Bing, \"You think it's beautiful. It's Rou who is here to find you, and I don't know what's wrong with her.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou? Nian Bing only remembered the beautiful woman in the wisdom group. She seemed to have a date with her. It seems that she had been in the library for a month. \"Since I am visiting the beautiful daughter of wisdom, how can I not see it?\" Nian Bing asked herself that she had not left any traces. A wise woman should not realize her true identity. \n\n\n\nLong Ling glared at Nian Bing, and there seemed to be a little more resentment in her eyes. \"Rou Er has already decided, you have no chance.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing laughed and said, \"Go and ask her to come in quickly. Don't worry, why would a little person like me have any inappropriate thoughts?\"\n\n\n\nAre you really a little person? A little doubt arose in Long Ling's heart. Without saying anything, he turned around. After a while, when his steps sounded again, Luo Rou, wearing a plain white dress, had already followed Long Ling. The white-clothed robe held the blue length and the wise eyes, which made people feel pure and pure from their hearts. Compared to the grand dress that day, Luo Rou now has a somewhat elegant beauty.When Luo Rou saw Nian Bing, she couldn't help but be stunned for a moment, and turned her head to Long Ling beside her and asked, \"Sheng, is he Nian Bing?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling smiled and said, \"Isn't it just him? You don't know him for only a month?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at his body with consciousness. Only then did he realize that the magic robe on his body was already full of folds, and there was a bad smell on his body. He touched his face, and the beard had grown a lot, so it was hard for Luo Rou to blame him for not knowing him. As soon as I learned magic, I really forgot everything. He said embarrassedly, \"Sorry, Miss Luo Rou, I made you laugh. Do I look so innocent like this?\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou covered her mouth and smiled lightly, saying, \"It's a bit, and she's a little haggard. It seems that you have worked very hard recently!\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling said, \"He is not very hard, but it is too hard. I don't understand what supports him to work so hard. If this continues, I'm afraid his body will have to cross. But whoever said he doesn't listen, as if those magic books are his wife.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"Don't you mock me. Can't I clean it up now?\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou smiled slightly and said, \"When you clean it up to nothing, you should remember our agreement.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingmei said with a slight snake: \"What do you really have?\"",

    "content": "The ban continues to be lifted, and everyone is welcome to vote more, especially VIP votes.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLuo Rou said proudly, \"Of course, even if I don't have any experience, the wise woman is a person who abides by the words. Let's talk to him alone. Ling Ye, sorry, I must tell him alone.\"\n\n\n\nIf it is snowy and you may have to ask for the final answer, but Long Ling is different. Her gentle nature makes her softer and said, \"Then don't be here. Nian Bing, go to your dormitory, you should clean yourself up. Oh, by the way, Dad originally wanted to change you into a room where you live, but you have been here, so you haven't changed. Let's talk about it when you finish your study in the library.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Nothing is said, these are just external things, Miss Luo Rou, please.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing took Luo Rou away from the library for the first time in a month. Long Ling did not follow him, but just said a word to them and left.\n\n\n\nAlthough the dormitory has not come back for a while, it is still so refreshing. Nian Bing looked at the magic mark he left with consciousness. No one had ever moved the hidden things. He asked Luo Rou to enter the house and said, \"You sit down first, I'll go clean it up.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does it feel like not taking a bath in a month? Nian Bing finally arrived. It took a full time to clean it up. When his whole body returned to refresh, he secretly swore that he would never be so ugly again. He would not be happy if he had to let go of a person in front of the beauties. \n\n\n\nChen Lu Dao scraped off the beard on his face under Nian Bing's mature operation, changed into his original coarse cloth clothes, and walked out of the washing room.\n\n\n\nLuo Rou, who had been waiting for a while, was not impatient. Seeing Nian Bing, she couldn't help but feel shocked. Although Nian Bing was wearing an ordinary coarse cloth at this time, she looked so handsome. His face looked a little white, which was obviously due to the fatigue of the recent period, and she was bathing on her body. The fragrance behind him, the golden combed behind his brain, was as simple as a person compared to before. Although Nian Bing was not a martial arts skill, he had a long figure, shoulders and back, and his unusually handsome face, which was indeed quite powerful in his killing power. Luo Rou, who had always been self-reliant, couldn't help but feel a little frustrated.\n\n\n\nNian Bing walked to the sand beside Luo Rou and sat down. He raised his anger and said, \"It feels so comfortable! Miss Luo Rou, what's the matter now? If you are here to admit it, then can I ask you something?\"\n\n\n\nAlthough Luo Rou was slightly unfair, she quickly recovered, smiled slightly, and said, \"No, I am here to collect the benefits I deserve.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing leaned against the armrest of the sand, looked at Luo Rou calmly, made a requesting hand, and said, \"I want to hear what our daughter of wisdom has found.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou smiled confidently, stood up, walked to the center of the room and stopped, and said to Nian Bing with her back: \"The three words \"Demon Killing are not enough?\"\n\n\n\nHearing the three words \"Demonic Slaughter\" and Nian Bing jumped up from the sand, his heartbeat increased rapidly. Although he had already seen Luo Rou very high, he still didn't expect that she could find these. After a few seconds of silence, he calmed his language as much as possible, \"What's the reason?\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou turned around and looked at Nian Bing with a smile, with a wise light in her eyes, \"There are many reasons. I have to admit that you are the biggest enemy I have ever met. In this case, you are still able to remain calm. It has been proven that you are not a simple person. I didn't expect you to be a killer at first. However, when I learned that you were often not in the woodshed at night, I became suspicious. After a long guess and careful reversal, I can almost certain that you were the devil who killed Liao San.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's mood calmed down at this time, because he thought that even if Luo Rou guessed everything, she could come to find herself alone. It was obvious that she had not told the matter out of the matter, so it was enough. At least he still had a roundabout way of doing it, \"Please continue.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou smiled slightly and said, \"First, I asked silence. She told me carefully about how you knew you. The reason you knew is Liao San, that's right. Moreover, Liao San has insulted you very seriously. This is the root of hatred.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled indifferently and said, \"Liao San has a skin dog. There are more people who have hatred with him, and more people who have deeper hatred than me. Just because of this, do you say I am a devil? It's too powerful.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou smiled and said, \"Of course it's more than that. On the night when Liao San's accident, you probably didn't have any evidence that you were not there. I've been quiet and spiritual. At that time, you didn't appear in Qingfeng or any place in the Magician Association. To be sure, you should have tried to attack Liao San before returning to Qingfeng after leaving the Magician Association. In addition, I investigated that Liao San's real cause of death was ice magic, and later the Ice and Snow Goddess's priest was verified. All the ice-type magicians in the magician association can tell that they were in other places at that time. I heard that your magic control is extremely strong and the power of the ice-type magician, and only you can kill Liao San. Combined with these few points, coupled with my straightforwardness, I can clearly believe that you are the one who killed Liao San. Of course, you may also have a companion who is good at long fire magic. As for who he is, I can't find it.\" \n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"The wise woman is not a god. Don't you think these reasons are very strong? It's more about your understanding.With these reasons alone, you cannot effectively prove that I was a demon. Otherwise, President Long could find these things, and he came to me to calculate the account. \"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou looked at Nian Bing who was unable to enter, and a trace of hesitation appeared in her eyes, \"No, these are just my guesses, and no one has ever proved or documented them. However, my straightforwardness told me with certainty that person is you.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"I have to admit that Miss Luo Rou is very smart, but you have already lost the prize between us.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou had a slight eyebrows and said, \"Don't you admit that you are a devil's killer? You can rest assured that Liao Sanben is not a good thing. Even if you admit that you are a devil's killer, I will not do anything to you. I will not tell others about this.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing slammed her head and said, \"I have never been worried about this. First, I believe in the wise lady. Secondly, even if you really say it, no one will believe it. Even if President Long Zhi knows that what you are saying is true, he will definitely take it for me, before you come to find me. , Ling Er should have told you the importance of me to the trade association now. To be honest, although your guess is lacking in evidence, it is indeed correct. It is not wrong. I was the killer of Liao San. I never leave my tail when doing things. Although you guessed it, it is absolutely impossible to prove it.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou smiled, and the moving beauty shone with her purpose, \"Okay! It's really you. You have already admitted it now. Should we consider how you should fulfill your contract?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing also smiled, \"No, of course not. I just said that, although you guessed it, you got it for a loan.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou's face changed slightly and she said, \"What do you mean? Just because I have no evidence, I said I'm going to be true? We guessed your career at the beginning. As a man, you won't be fooled.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing laughed, \"Just, even if I'm not a good person, I still disdain for cheating. Winning means winning, and winning means winning. I understand the reason for wanting to be complacent. I say you've lost because you guessed my career at all. Killer is not my real career, but it's just a place to be excited. It's just that Liao San is not so ugly. Of course, not a magician.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou was completely stunned. She saw from Nian Bing's gaze that Nian Bing had no right. His great confidence could not be pretended. \"No, I don't believe it, I don't believe it. If you are not a professional magician or killer, how could you achieve your current achievements? You are the youngest magician!\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's eyes showed a glitter of humanity and said calmly, \"It's time to solve some things. Miss Luo Rou, I will tell you with my actions, what is my real career. Please come with me.\" As he said, he turned around and walked in the direction he wanted.As soon as he walked to the door, the sound of knocking suddenly rose. Nian Bing opened the door, and saw Long Ling standing outside the door in a pretty face holding a new ice magician robe. When he saw Nian Bing, he couldn't help but smile and said, \"What are you talking about? Let's change this for you.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing took the clothes into her hand, and looked at Long Ling's soft gaze, and couldn't help but feel a little confused. If she could marry such a wife, it would be a blessing. The mind was born faster and disappeared faster. With a slight hesitation, he immediately returned to normal, \"We have finished talking and are about to go out. Spirit, let's go together too.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling smiled slightly and said, \"Me? Will it affect you?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing slammed her head and said, \"Of course not. We are all friends. You wait a moment, I'll go change your clothes.\"\n\n\n\nIn a while, when Nian Bing walked out of the washing room again, he had become a great ice magician. Long Ling looked at him who had regained his handsomeness and couldn't help but smile with kindness. Luo Rou, who was beside him, lowered his head and seemed to be thinking about something. \"Two beautiful ladies, we can come out.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling asked curiously: \"Where are we going?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled mysteriously and said, \"Go to a place you are familiar with, Ling, don't you want to know what I am fucking?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling was stunned for a moment and said, \"You? Are you not a magician? Can you still have any subordinates?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing slammed his head and said, \"No, you are wrong. The magician is my subordinate. Let's go, Miss Spirit and Miss Rou.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou heard Nian Bing call herself Rou for the first time, and a strange thing rose in her heart. She raised her head and looked at him, and said, \"Okay, I'm going to see what you are using to prove it. Let's go.\"\n\n\n\nAfter leaving the magician association gate, Luo Rou asked, \"Is the place you go far? How do you plan to take us there?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment and said, \"It's not close, it's in the center of the city.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou stared at him with wide eyes and said, \"You don't want us to walk with you. Hello, we are ladies, I really admire you.\" As she said, she walked to the street and waved. Nian Bing looked in the direction she waved, and saw a luxurious horse flying over. Four white tall horses couldn't help but remind him of the past. Yes, the dignified Earl Miss should have a horse. This way, it's better to avoid walking. \n\n\n\nLuo Rou turned around and said, \"Go on the car. I really don't understand what kind of person you are.\"\n\n\n\nListening her strange words, Nian Bing just smiled slightly, and the three of them got on the horse together.\n\n\n\nThere was a faint fragrance in the horse, the mug was very soft, and it was very comfortable to sit on it. Luo Rou said to Nian Bing, \"You should always give the driver a precise address.\"\n\n\n\nWith a slight smile, Nian Bing said, \"Go forward to the center of the city first, and you will know when you get to the place.\"\n\n\n\nThe horse was moving forward quickly, and the horse with the logo of the Earl's Mansion was flying in the city. Passers-by saw that they hid and almost didn't bother with it. It took only half a time to take Nian Bing and the other two to the most prosperous area in the center of the Snow City.\n\n\n\nAlong the way, Nian Bing didn't say anything. Sitting there, he was closing his eyes to recuperate. Long Ling was surprised that he was meditating, and his heart was inadvertently painful. Over the past few days, he was really too tired.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, wake up.\" Luo Rou pushed Nian Bing, who was closing her eyes a little displeased.\n\n\n\nNian Bing opened her eyes quietly, lifted the car and looked outside, and said, \"Okay, let's park here, two ladies, we should get off the car.\"\n\n\n\nNo matter how smart Luo Rou is, she still can't tell what medicine she sells in Nian Binghulu. She looked around with her eyebrows and Long Ling, looking around. This is the Central Street of Ice City.\n\n\n\nNian Bing pointed to one of the most eye-catching signs by the way and said, \"Let's go, this is our destination.\"\n\n\n\nThe signature Long Ling and Luo Rou are no longer familiar with each other. They are one of the most famous hotels in Ice and Snow City, Qingfeng.\n\n\n\nLuo Rou looked at Nian Bing with a bad expression and said, \"You won't tell me that your real job is to chop firewood. If that's the case, I think I don't have to go in. I will feel like I'm going to be with someone who doesn't abide by his contract.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at Luo Rou's eyes without any reservation. The two of them showed a brilliance of confidence in their eyes. Just when they looked at it, Luo Rou's mental power naturally could not be compared with Nian Bing, who had been practicing magic. It quickly came, \"Hey, what's going on? You said!\"",

    "content": "The ban continues to be lifted, and everyone is welcome to vote more, especially VIP votes.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled indifferently and said, \"Miss Rou, you just need to remember that you can just give me a condition. Let's go in.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing, who changed into a magician robe, was very different from before. The service staff at Qingfengjie did not recognize him at all, but these service members naturally recognized Long Ling and Luo Rou. They hurried forward and said respectfully, \"The two ladies are here. Are you here to find us ladies?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling was stunned for a moment, and his eyes turned to Nian Bing. Nian Bing said, \"You also call Miss Xue Jing. You have solved all the solutions, so that she can continue to make mistakes and avoid me.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling clicked a little and said, \"Then let's go in.\" The three of them walked into Qingfeng Hall with the service student. Compared with Dacheng Hall, this hall looked much smaller, but the layout was very special. They were decorated with wood carved everywhere, and the tables and chairs were no exception. They were completely carved from special wood. There was a faint fragrance in the whole hall. The soft music came from behind the curtains, which seemed to be a piano sound. The graceful music was very light and there would never be a noisy feeling.\n\n\n\nNian Bing couldn't help but secretly repent in his heart. It was his first time to come to this large hall. He thought in his heart that it was indeed not a blessing to be famous. Every detail arranged here is the result of careful consideration.\n\n \n\nNian Bing said to the service student, \"I'm sorry, please come out. We have something to do to find her.\"\n\n\n\nThe service looked at Nian Bing in confusion. He only now felt that the man looked familiar, but he couldn't remember where he had seen him. He naturally saw Nian Bing, but how could Nian Bing compare when chopping wood, whether it was tied or elegant? The service student was indeterminate to see the two daughters of Long Ling. The wise girl Luo Rou pointed at him and said, \"Go, tell Jing Jing, just say that Ling Jing and I are here, so that she can come out soon.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou was actually a little impatient to know what Nian Bing was doing. Looking at Nian Bing’s confidence, she suddenly had expectations in her heart. There were too few things that could surprise her in the ice and snow city. She has always been famous for her strategist and striving for thousands of miles. However, since Nian Bing appeared, she has brought more and more surprises to her, and it has almost never stopped for a moment. After all, whether it was the ice cream cake she gave her as a birthday gift, or the murder incident found later, she was curious about Nian Bing. Just when she thought she had fully understood this person, this person suddenly told her that everything she knew was wrong. At this time, her mood was extremely complicated and she really wanted to find out what was going on.\n\n\n\nThe service student went to the house, Nian Bing took a chair and sat down, made a request to the two girls, and smiled and said, \"What? Will the two not sit together?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling smiled and said, \"I've been sitting all the way, so I'll just stand. I've heard from my mother before that girls always sit, which will affect their figure.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou walked to Nian Bing's side, lowered her waist, and said to him, \"I'm coming out when I'm calm and full. Have you thought about how to collect the venue?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled indifferently and said, \"Of course I've thought about it, Miss Zhimiao, I heard that you are married. Are you so close to me, aren't you afraid that others will misunderstand?\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou was stunned and her eyes fell on Long Ling beside her, \"What did you say to him? Okay, Ling, you are not jealous.\"\n\n\n\nWhen Long Ling heard this, he had a big face, \"Rou, don't say that Nianbing and I are just friends, so why are we jealous? I just told him the truth to avoid doing anything he did.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"No, no, I am a person who has always been self-aware. Why did the Spirituals be so miserable?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling gave him a blank look and said, \"Wrong? I'm afraid not. I clearly remember someone gave him a birthday gift that day, and he didn't let us eat it.\" The way she said, she was completely angry with her boyfriend, with her beautiful eyes fluttering, and all the service staff on the side were stunned.\n\n\n\nNian Bing said in his heart, \"Long Ling really has some good feelings for him!\" I'm afraid that I can't stay in this Ice City for too long. Luo Rou burst out laughing and said, \"I'm not jealous, look at your behavior.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling was shy and had to respond. He heard a crisp sound, \"Spirit, soft, you all come. I was worried and didn't know what to do. It's great. Since you have all come, let Uncle Ming give us some good food. As long as I go to grind him, he will agree.\"\n\n\n\nThe red figure came with the sound, and Nian Bing suddenly realized that the red color was the most suitable for the snow. When wearing a red dress, she was like a group of passionate fire that could melt everything. \n\n\n\nSince Long Ling and Luo Rou both stood in front of Nian Bing and held most of his body, Xue Jingu did not notice him. When she came to the second daughter, she looked at Long Ling in surprise and said, \"Sheng, what's wrong with you? Why are you so red in your face! You're not sick.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou, who was standing beside her, laughed loudly when she heard Xue Jing's question. The embarrassed Dragon Spirit wanted to have a place to drill in.\n\n\n\nNian Bing stood up and at the right time to unwind the dragon spirit. \"Miss Xue Jing, we meet again.\"\n\n\n\nAs soon as Nian Bing stood up, he attracted Xue Jing's attention. Seeing him, Xue Jing's face changed drastically and said coldly, \"It's you? Who will let you get into our storms again? We can't nourish such a little girl like you. Please go out, we won't welcome you.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing didn't mind, she smiled indifferently and said, \"Miss Xue Jing, don't miss it. Even if I am a guest here today, since Qingfeng is doing business, then I don't think you have any reason to reject a magician customer, right?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jinghu snorted and said something. Luo Rou hurriedly, \"Yujing, don't think about the past. Today we came to you with him to see how he was so sad. Is it okay?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing was stunned for a moment and said in confusion: \"What's going on?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"Miss Xue Jing, I think you must be wondering why I had to go to Dacheng. Later, I came to Qingfeng to chop wood. As my magician, there was no need to do this at all, but I really did it.\"\n\n\n\nAfter hearing this, Xue Jing and Long Ling didn't feel anything. Luo Routon beside him was beating his heart a little, yes! A wise man like him could not do something unreasonable. Since he entered the clear wind to chop wood, there was naturally his reason. He would never be as simple as a devil's death. Thinking of this, Luo Rou felt for the first time that the convoy between her and Nian Bing might be about to be lost.\n\n\n\nXue Jing snorted coldly and said, \"People like you, I'm afraid they won't have any kindness when they come to us. I don't know where your brain is wrong and I have to chop wood. I don't do it. I think you are either a fool or a neurotic.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"No, it's true that I came to Qingfeng to Qingfeng, but it's not a bad heart. You all want to know why, it's easy. I'll tell you now and tell you with your actions. Miss Xue Jing, please come out with Master Mingyuan? In fact, I came to Qingfeng mainly for him.\"\n\n\n\nXue was stunned for a moment and said, \"For Uncle Ming?\" She never expected that Nian Bing would give such an answer.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"That's right. As long as you ask Master Ming to come out, everything will naturally be clear.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing thought for a while and said, \"Okay, then wait, I'm going to see what's the relationship between you and Uncle Ming. He doesn't know you.\" After speaking, he ran to the back like a group of red clouds.\n\n\n\nNian Bing said to the service student on the side: \"Qingfeng is one of the best hotels in Ice and Snow City. I think you have all kinds of tableware here. Please give me a one-meter-long pan with a plate with a floor of one meter. At the same time, you will get nine cucumbers and three sugarcane. Thank you. As for how much money in the end, I will give you.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough the service student saw that there seemed to be a conflict between Nian Bing and Xue Jing, he was brought by Long Ling and Luo Rou, so he didn't say much, so he went down and prepared immediately.\n\n\n\nLong Ling said in surprise: \"Nianbing, what do you want to fuck a plate? There are also yellow melons. Do you want Uncle Ming to give us some food? That's impossible. Uncle Ming's skills are absolutely impossible to leak.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingyan sighed and said, \"What can't be out of it? If someone else can learn it, it's a skill. It's because I cherish it myself. I don't know how many good things were passed down in ancient times. Spirit, don't be impatient, wait and see.\"\n\n\n\nIn the first time, Mingyuan and Xue Jing came out first. Xue Jing walked to Nian Bing and said, \"Uncle Ming has come out. Now you can say, why did you come to Qingfeng to find Uncle Ming?\" As she said, her eyes were filled with rude expressions, \"It shouldn't be to worship Uncle Ming as a teacher, right?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled indifferently and said, \"What can I do? The person who is called is a teacher. Master Ming, I don't know if you remember what I said that day.\"\n\n\n\nMing Yuan was a little stunned when he came out and saw Nian Bing dressed by the magician. When Nian Bing asked him, he realized that the young man in front of him, who was wearing a big magician, was the firewood chopper who made the golden incense ring that day and said in confusion: \"You, why have you become a magician? That day, because something happened in the city, I have never been concerned about it. When I looked for you later, you had left Qingfeng. I'm really strange. How did you learn about the creation of the Golden Wind Circle? It was passed down from generation to generation by my teacher. This secret is impossible for outsiders to know. So, although there are Golden Wind Circle sales in other places, it is very unauthentic, far worse than our Qingfeng Circle.\" \n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Of course, the words were sent by the teacher. Master Ming, you will understand soon.\" At this time, the service student who had gone to get the goods had already returned. Holding a big plate in his hand, he walked to Nian Bing's side.\n\n\n\nNian Bing stretched out his right hand, calmly picked up the plate, and placed it on a square table next to it. The one-meter-long plate almost filled the entire table. Nian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Now, the answer can be revealed. Master Ming, in the art world, there is also a boxing that cannot be separated. If you can't leave your mouth, you must have the most proud knives on your body, I want to borrow it.\"\n\n\n\nMingyuan's face changed and he said coldly, \"No, for the chef, a knife is life, and there is no difference between this and a warrior.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled with his old face, \"Is that so? I think your teacher should have told you that there was a man who helped him at the most dangerous time and taught him three great skills so that he could gain the reputation of a fairy in the cafe.\"\n\n\n\nAfter hearing this, Ming Yuanton was shocked, \"How did you know?\" His voice had changed a little. You know, this matter was extremely secret, and his teacher only told him one person.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Because the one who helped the magistrate was the master.\"\n\n\n\nMingyuan's whole body was shocked, \"You, you are a ghost...\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing stopped Mingyuan from talking again, stretched out his hand and said, \"How can I borrow a knife to use? Master Ming.\"\n\n\n\nMingyuan's eyes showed a look of respect. He looked at the cucumber and sugarcane in the plate, clicked a little, and said, \"Of course it's OK.\" When he touched his hand, a sharp knife of about 2 had jumped into his hand. Except for Nian Bing, no one on the scene could see that the knife came from Mingyuan's body.Nian Bing took the knife and looked at the faint green light flowing on the blade, and said, \"It's good. This must be the sword immortal who was the first to be a slasher. He said that this knife had once digged a whole cow from there, without any blood. It's really a good knife!\"\n\n\n\nMingyuan stood with his hand down and said, \"I dare not. This handle can only be regarded as a companion at most in front of the master's yang.\" Since Nian Bing told the secret of the first time, he had no doubt about Nian Bing's identity, because the words of the Golden Fragrance Circle were exactly what his teacher Fu told the benefactor at the beginning.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, glanced at the three girls who were in a daze around him, and said with a smile, \"I'm going to start. Now, although the weather has gradually changed, the summer heat still exists. Today, I will give the three ladies a refreshing dish. I hope you can like it. Please step back a little, thank you.\"",

    "content": "Let’s continue to lift the ban, and I will say that the starting point backend system has been improved, and the discussion area can also be refined. The improvement conference will be held in the discussion area this Sunday. Everyone is welcome to participate.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAt this time, even Xue Jing, who was the straightest in his brain, could already see that Nian Bing was extraordinary. She was very familiar with Mingyuan. At first, his father, in order to ask Mingyuan to come to Qingfeng to take charge of the chef, I don’t know how much it cost. Although Mingyuan was just a chef in his name, there was a whole Qingfeng. Even when her father, Yu Xue, saw him very respectful. She always regarded her brotherly, and it was the first time she saw the expression of respect on Mingyuan's face. The person who made this expression appear was Nian Bing, who had a mysterious identity in front of her, who made her heart feel irritated.\n\n\n\nNian Bing was moved, picked up a few chopsticks from the table next to him, placed the whole code on the foot of the table, and then took out the cucumbers and sugarcane in the plate one by one and placed them on the chopsticks. The purpose was very clear, and it was not that the material was stained with dust. In the end, he only had a piece of cucumber left in his hand.\n\n\n\nNian Bing held the tail of the gua with his left hand and lifted it up. Although the weight of the nine gua that the service student received satisfies Nian Bing's requirements, their shapes were different. When Nian Bing looked at the gua, he seemed to have forgotten everything around him, and only the green gua in his eyes. Holding Mingyuan's knife in his right hand, keeping his static state.\n\n\n\nXue Jing saw Nian Bing standing there strangely, and couldn't help feeling impatient. She wanted to say something, but was stopped by Mingyuan. Mingyuan snatched Xue Jingyuan and signaled her not to be surprised by Nian Bing. Then she focused on looking at Nian Bing's hand, waiting for the expected scene in her heart to appear. \n\n\n\nFinally, Nian Bing moved. To be sure, it was his right hand that moved, and his left hand was as stable as a rock and pinched the tail of the cucumber. The knife in his right hand brought a faint green light, and gently cut into the head of the cucumber two inches downward. This was the first knife.\n\n\n\nXue Jingu almost laughed out loud. After watching for a long time, she turned out to be just on the cucumber. She covered her mouth very hard, so she didn't laugh out loud. However, she soon couldn't laugh because Nian Bing's wrist flipped slightly and another knife. This knife, under the previous knife, a piece of paper-thin slices of cucumber appeared. The most peculiar thing was that the yellow slices were separated from the upper and lower parts, and only had a slight slight. According to common sense, the weight of the yellow slices below should be able to completely silence it, but in fact, they were still connected.\n\n\n\nMing Yuan was subconsciously surprised, \"The sword technique of the lotus-blocked silk is a good sword technique!\" After saying this, he hurriedly covered his mouth, but the excited light in his eyes was indeed unconcealed. As a top-level chef, what else is more perfect than seeing the chef art he imagined?Nian Bing didn't hear Mingyuan's voice at all. His spirit was completely stuck on the melon. The knife moved again, but it was no longer the slow two swords before. The knife was like snow, and his wrists seemed to be dancing in the air. Mingyuan's eyes could not see clearly what Nian Bing had done, only seeing that The cucumber was slowly lowered, and each piece was slightly connected. With the slightest bit, the weight of the cucumber fell into the pan, and the position of the cucumber head was exactly the center of the entire pan, with the knife light continuously flashing, and everyone on the scene was stunned.\n\n\n\nLuo Rou seemed to see the scene of Nian Bing cutting the cake again, but it was obvious that the knife method of cutting cucumber is much more difficult than cutting the cake. The cucumber slices connected by each piece are not only thin to the extreme, but the most valuable thing is the word uniform, and the place where each piece is connected is so even, without any flaws. \n\n\n\nThe head of the yellow melon finally hangs in the center of the plate. The yellow melon, which was originally less than a ruler, had turned about one and a half feet long at this time. The sword light in Nian Bing's hand was still flashing, and the piece of yellow melon gradually stretched out the yellow melon bars. At this moment, Nian Bing's left hand finally moved, and his wrist trembled slightly. At the moment the knife light stopped, the yellow melon bars cleverly surrounded the yellow melon bars behind the head of the yellow melon bars. The sword light continued to flash, and the yellow melon strips gradually grew. When the three circles of the cucumber surrounded the plate, Nian Bing's knife finally reached the end of the cucumber. He did not continue to pick it up, but put the end of the cucumber on the side of the plate.\n\n\n\nIn the eyes of the public, such knife skills can only be described as miracle. The miracle continues, and the second yellow gua has jumped into Nian Bing's hands. This time it is also a visual, but the time of visualization has been significantly shortened. When the Daoguang flashes again, the same situation as the first yellow gua appears again. The sword light was repeated, but the eyes of the crowd did not leave the knife in Mianbing's hand and the cucumber in her hand. Although it was a repeated action, in their eyes, this action was so vivid.\n\n\n\nThe old one is growing, and the other is a plate for three weeks. This is the second one, followed by the third one, the fourth one... Each piece of the cucumber undergoes the same process. Luo Rou, who was sharp-eyed, was surprised. On the cucumber that Nian Bing completed, there was a faint white mist.\n\n\n\n  Others didn’t notice this situation at the beginning. When the fifth section was completed, the entire plate that was one meter straight was covered with a faint white fog, and the green cucumber seemed to be invisible, looking extremely strange.I don't know when the owner of Qingfeng, Xue Jin, had already arrived behind his daughter. Everyone else was in a state of silence. No one actually came. When Xue Jin saw Nian Bing with the flashing light in his hand, he immediately followed the other people's back. He had the power of the martial arts family and his eyesight. Of course, there is a place where Nian Bing's movements are extremely fast, as if there is no need to think about it. Looking at the growing yellow melon, Xueqiu asked himself that his control of power would never be as good as Nian Bing. That wonderful sword technique has reached the peak and is extremely impressive, which is a pity. \n\n\n\nWhen the nine cucumbers were all completed, the entire plate was almost full. The nine cucumbers that were lying in the plate were in the same position. The nine cucumbers were actually slightly raised and they were piled up in the center of the plate. There was no difference in position at all. Even the nine cucumbers were strangely kept in an equal position.\n\n\n\nThe sword flashed and headed towards Mingyuan. Mingyuan jumped and raised his hand subconsciously, and the one who got the handle of the knife was the handle.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Ming, thank you for your knife.\" Nian Bing's mind seemed to have completely integrated into the vegetables in front of her. Her eyes fell on the green jade-like cucumber in the plate. Looking at the faint white ice fog rising from the sky, he reached into his hand and took out a small cloth bag, which was the tool when he made the dung meat for the bird girl in the water truck.\n\n\n\nWithout looking with your eyes, the index finger and middle finger naturally penetrated into the cloth bag. When the fingers left the cloth bag, a cold light was brought out. It was a small knife, which was only five inches long and the head of the knife was very small. The blade and the hilt behind were equal in length, each accounting for two and a half inches. The half blade in front actually radiated a faint blue light, and there seemed to be a carving on the side of the blade.\n\n\n\nMing Yuan took a deep breath and murmured, \"Ghost Eagle God Sword.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"The magical axe and magical arts are dark blue flames, and the dragon carvings a sword is cold. It is the ghost carving.\"\n\n\n\nMingyuan glanced at Nian Bing, \"Who will fight with the ghost eagle when it comes out.\" Seeing the ghost eagle, the respect in his eyes became even more intense.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's eyes fell on the nine yellow melons in the center of the plate. \"Although the ghost sculpture is good, it depends on who is used. I hope I will not insult my master's reputation that year.\" His waist suddenly slapped and he was folded. His thighs were on the edge of the table. His whole body was at a 90-degree angle. His face was just above the center of the plate. His wrist was slightly slit, and he instantly slapped out nine swords. The original nine yellow melons had a mark on each of them. \n\n\n\nMingyuan suddenly understood what Nian Bing was going to fuck, and a look of caution appeared in his eyes. Originally, he was a little dissatisfied, but when he saw the first knife made by Nian Bing, he understood that only the sword skill was, and he was far away not the opponent of the young man in front of him.\n\n\n\nThere is not only Mingyuan who knows the goods on the scene. Xue Ni took a deep breath and started to sniff, \"Is this the most popular way to dance the dragon and the dragon dance? Oh my God, does it really exist?\"\n\n\n\nThe fact quickly answered the question of Xue Yan. Nian Bing came out of the knife. The dark blue light jumped between his five fingers like a cold flame. With the sword, he sang lightly: \"The ghost hand fell and shocked the sky, carved into waves and whirlpools. The magical craftsmanship is here forever and present. The sword rises and the moon reflects the cold spring.\" Only see the dark blue light The light kept spinning in the middle of the plate, and the snow clearly saw that every time a word was read, a trace would appear on the head of the nine cucumbers, and the green debris fell away. When the last word \"quan\" fell, plus the first nine swords, a total of 261 swords were completed in this short singing time. A circle of green debris is sprinkled in the center of the plate, forming a round ink green pattern with clear patterns and no slim deviations in the circular pattern. All debris and even sizes are exactly the same. The most shocking thing was the carvings above the fragments.\n\n\n\nNine carvings like jade are scattered, with deer antlers, slight corners of the mouth, and beads under the sphere. They are clearly nine dragons like jade! The dragon head is lifelike, and it is made of high spirits, as if it is swallowing clouds and vomiting mists.\n\n\n\nGhost sculpture, Nian Bing looked at the nine dragon heads and said lightly, \"It's a pity that I haven't achieved the extremely high dance in the Dragon Festival.\"\n\n\n\nMing Yuan asked hurriedly, \"What is that?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled indifferently, \"Nine Dragons, ten thousand changes.\" As he said, Nian Bing held the two ends of the plate with both hands, and with a little force, the plate came off the table. He was very careful, as if he was afraid of any deviation.\n\n\n\nAt this time, Xue Jing and Long Ling were already stunned, only Luo Rou's eyes were still slightly alive, and there was something more in her eyes.\n\n\n\nA layer of light blue light radiated from Nian Bing's body. The light condensed towards the table with his eyes. A round ice block that was straight like a human hand appeared on the table. The surface of the ice block was extremely bright, like a circular piece, about an inch thick. This is the most basic ice technique, but when used in Nianbing, its control power and effect are absolutely shocking compared to using a fourth-level magic.\n\n\n\nThe plate was put down again and landed on the ice. The position of the ice was in the center of the plate. After moving the edge of the plate, the plate turned slowly. The ghost eagle reappeared. When the tail of each cucumber turned to Nian Bing, the gloomy light flashed five times. After three circles, it was 135 times. His hand seemed to have just been moving for a few seconds. Green debris were flat below, forming nine cloud-like shapes. Under their support, nine lifelike green dragon tails appeared.\n\n\n\nWhen the tail of the dragon appeared, the nine cucumbers in the plate seemed to be alive, like nine green dragons spinning in the clouds, the plate was still slowly moving, and the nine green dragons floated on the clouds. They seemed to be playing and asking each other. The gathering of nine dragons is so real.Nian Bing did not stop. He picked up one of the three sugarcane sections. The ghost carving was flickered, and the sugarcane skin fell naturally. This time it was not in the plate, but fell to a side. The ghost carving danced, and the milky white sugarcane changed under the knife. When the plate stopped turning, the ghost carving in Nian Bing's hand also stopped. What appeared in his hand was a strange shape, with a bottom support below, and a straight line with only a fine white rod with chopsticks on it. At the top, there was a milky white ball. The surface of the ball was extremely shiny, looking as breathtaking as white jade. People like Mingyuan, Xueyan and others know that a round ball seems simple, but it is very difficult to be so flawless. However, Nian Bing had already shocked them much, and at this time, their hearts were already a little numb. \n\n\n\nNian Bing reached into the plate and carefully put the carved sugarcane into the center of the head of the Nine Dragons to form the ninth dragon's beads.\n\n\n\nPerfection, except for perfection, everyone can no longer think of other words to describe everything in front of you.\n\n\n\nThe plate turned up again, and Nian Bing picked up two other sugarcane at the same time. The light blue light gathered in his hands. This time, he did not peel it, rubbed the two sugarcane heads against each other and quickly.\n\n\n\nWhat can sugarcane rub? It's nothing more than juice, but the sugar cane under the extreme is different. The milky white ice powder fell down, carrying a sweet smell, and frosted into the plate. Under the influence of the ice powder, the originally weakened ice fog in the plate rose again. Before the sugarcane was fully washed by the ice ice, the ice powder formed by the sugarcane had spread all over every corner of the plate.\n\n\n\nThe nine vivid green dragons hold the pearls with the power of the clouds. The green in the plate is not single, because the depth and purity brings a fresh atmosphere. Coupled with the spots of ice fog and sugarcane pearls, everything is so perfect.\n\n\n\nNian Bing clapped her hands, smiled indifferently, and said, \"The fragrance of cucumber, the sweetness of sugarcane, is best suited to relieve heat and cold.\"\n\n\n\nMingyuan's eyes shone brightly, \"Can you tell me what's the name of this dish?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled indifferently and said word by word: \"Nine-Qing-Sheng-Long-Bing-Yun-Hun-Hun-.\"",

    "content": "I saw many book friends' congratulations left by my friends. My mistress was really moved. With your silent support, my mistress has already written the sixth set. In order to report everyone's support, I have never been too supervised a set of books. I didn't know it before, nor did I do it in the future, or maybe the books I wrote will have flaws, but I will keep working hard to make progress. The 12.o5 escalation conference will be held in the discussion area this Sunday evening. After the upgrade of the starting point in the discussion area, it can be improved. It is more convenient for everyone to leave a message. Welcome to participate.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nYes, it is Jiuqing Shenlong Bingyun, which is also one of the famous seven-series feasts after Nian Bing became famous.\n\n\n\nLooking at the foggy and slim Nine-green Dragon Bingyun in front of me, everyone on the scene felt that they couldn't taste it. After all, this could no longer be described as a dish, and it was clearly a plate of art! It took Nian Bingyi a moment to carve the precious artwork. Looking at the ripples of ice and the lifelike nine-lined green dragon, no one took action first.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's eyes fell on Luo Rou, \"Miss Zhimiao, I think you should know what I am doing now. It's true that my real career is actually a chef. Miss Xue Jing, the reason why I chose one of the Dacheng or Qingfeng to enter was to be able to explore the arts with the chef, and it didn't There is a different purpose, and I think the misunderstanding between us can be lifted. A dish can be proven to be a lot, or you may wonder, as a magician, how can I learn how to cook? I can tell you clearly that in my heart, the chef is definitely a high level that can be compared with the magician. A professional career, and by relying on my own art, I can satisfy the aspirations of countless people. Art is an art, and it is my goal to suck it up. Magic is just a skill to help art. I haven't been away from the teacher for a long time. For me, the long journey of pursuing art is still very long. Okay, As I said this, please savor it slowly. If the ice fog dissipates, the dish will lose the taste it should have. I have explained it clearly. See you again, Ling Er, please stay, I will go back first. \"Please put your things in your arms, put the cloth bag into the skull, and then turned around after Nian Bing was slightly raised to the public. No one stopped him, and everyone's mind was still on the dish in front of him, and Nian Bing's voice kept rumbling in their brains. \n\n\n\nThe first reaction of Mingyuan, who was also a chef, came. He took a handful of chopsticks from the side and sent them to Xue Yan and the three girls. He was the first move. He slid a piece of cucumber in front of the chopsticks. As soon as the chopsticks were connected to the cucumber, the cucumber slices naturally separated from the \"Qinglong\". The feeling of being carried was not produced at all. It can be seen how clever the connection of the entire \"Qinglong\" was.Seeing Mingyuan moving, the others also started to move, adding a few pieces of cucumbers into their mouths, and the thin cucumber melted in their mouths, turning into a sweet liquid and sliding into their belly. It was an indescribable smell. The 36 million pores of the whole body seemed to be completely opened at that moment. The icy breath was connected with the heaven and earth. The refreshing feeling made people want to be in ecstasy. Not only did the body's heat disappear, but the mind was also restored and they woke up in the sweetness.\n\n\n\nThe three girls Luo Rou, Long Ling and Xue Jingu had a strange color in their eyes. This wonderful taste is the most loved by girls. They did not stop and their chopsticks flew in the ice fog. In a while, the Jiuqing Shenlong had completely entered the abdomen of the five people before the ice fog disappeared. It is clear, sweet, refreshing and refreshing. The refreshing feeling of the whole body is so wonderful. What's more clever is that Qingfeng is mainly simple and elegant. This dish with simple ingredients is exactly the same as the characteristics of Qingfeng.\n\n\n\nMingyuan put down the chopsticks in his hand, put his eyes together, and murmured: \"The fragrance of cucumber is completely released in the cold, and the sweetness of sugarcane is refreshing and transparent, what a magical dish.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jin looked at Mingyuan and said, \"Xiao Ming, if you make this dish, can you achieve this effect?\"\n\n\n\nMing Yuan Jing opened his eyes and looked at Xue Yan, slammed his head, and said, \"It's absolutely impossible. The most important thing about this dish is two points, one is knife skills, and the other is magic. It is the ice breath emitted by the magic that just stimulates the fragrance of the cucumber. I will never be able to do this. If I use ice blocks to the town the day after tomorrow, the taste will be too bad. Then, why not? Who can do the ice powder formed by sugarcane? I'm afraid that only his master can come up with magic. What a magician! It seems that the world of cooking will cause a huge wave again. In the near future, he will become the leader of the world of cooking. It seems that there is no end to the chef, and I need to learn too much.\" \n\n\n\nXue Jing's eyes were filled with a strange light and murmured, \"I really didn't expect that he was a chef. When Qingfeng came to Qingfeng, he actually wanted to learn about the art of cooking. Low-cost vegetables like Huanggua can be made so delicious. If he was willing to help us, we would probably have Qingfeng. Dad, can we ask him to come back and help Uncle Ming?\"\n\n\n\nWhen Xue Xi heard the daughter's words, he was very excited and turned to Mingyuan. Mingyuan said lightly, \"Brother, if he really wants to come, I can bring out the position of chef. Although he is not old, he is the first. However, you have heard what he said before. He has a long ambition and will never be in a corner. I am afraid he will not agree to stay.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jin sighed and said, \"When I first met him, I saw that he was different from others, but I never expected that his excellence was actually in the art of cooking. No matter what, I would try my best to listen to the destiny of heaven. If he really didn't want to stay, at least I, Xue Jin, would have to make this friend. Oh, by the way, Brother Ming, who is his teacher?\"\n\n\n\nMingyuan's eyes showed a light of respect and said, \"Brother, you should have heard of the five great chef gods in the world of art.\"\n\n\n\nXue Xiao said, \"Of course I have heard that I had studied them in my early years. Unfortunately, these five chef gods seem to have been aware of it and cannot be asked to take charge of them. The five chef gods you refer to should be Gui, Lie, Hun, Spirit, and Miao.\"\n\n\n\nMing Yuan said, \"It's them. The wonderful chef gods among them are the masters, and their rankings are divided into first and then. Although they are listed as the five chef gods, there is still a gap between them. That young man was the five chef gods, the devil gods. At the beginning, it was the help of the former ghost knights that made our teacher achieve the success of our later achievements. The teacher always regarded the ghost knight as his benefactor, and at the same time, he was also a teacher. His master's age comparison The Ghost Fighter is still much bigger, but every time he mentions the Ghost Fighter, he is extremely respectful. Unfortunately, the Ghost Fighter left the world of art after something happened, and there was no news since then. I really didn't expect that his disciple was born, which was even different from the Ghost Fighter, or perhaps his condition, but he had more magic. I believe that after several years of practice, he would not be able to achieve the achievements of the Ghost Fighter's peak period, and it was even possible to surpass it.\" \n\n\n\nXue Yan's eyes showed a look of surprise, \"Ghost Ke, it turns out to be a disciple of the Ghost Ke. Oh, I'm so confused. I don't know how to cherish such a talent. If my peers knew that the Ghost Ke's disciple was chopping wood with clear winds, I wonder how I would laugh at me. Jing, go and prepare for a gift, we will go to the Magician Association to pay our guilt.\"\n\n\n\nThe snow was surprisingly quiet and had no temper. She lightly pointed her head and walked towards the back of the hall.\n\n\n\nLuo Rou and Long Ling looked at each other and said to Xue Jin, \"Uncle Xue, we left first. He turned out to be a chef. It was beyond my expectations. I have always been wise and I have been in his hands twice. It seems that the name of this wise woman should be cancelled. I am so rude. Uncle said to Jingjing, uncle see you again.\" Luo Rou's mood at this time was more complicated than Xue Jingjing. Nian Bing had already proved everything to her with her actions, and the payment had already been reduced. Luo Rou had no regrets. She was convinced, and it was too time to fulfill the agreement.\n\n\n\nNian Bing walked on the streets of Bingxue City. It was the first time he had been working hard to make a dish since leaving the Peach Blossom Forest. He is in a very good mood now. Not only because he solved the problem of Xue Jing and Luo Rou, but also because he has improved his magic knowledge and has helped the chefs. He is making Nine When the Qingshenlong Ice Cloud was invisible, the magic use could reach an invisible realm. Although it was only the lowest level of ice magic, he was already very satisfied with himself, except that he could not compare with his master's condition, in the fusion of magic and crafts, he was one step closer to the fusion of magic and crafts. When he reached his level, he no longer needed to use repeated striking to enhance his strength. What he needs now is opportunities, opportunities that can bring him enlightenment.As he was walking, the sound of the car behind him suddenly rose. Nian Bing leaned toward the side of the road with consciousness. However, the horse he had taken had parked beside him. Luo Rou leaned out of the car and said with a strange voice: \"Big kid, get on the car. I'll take you back.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, and did not refuse, so she rode on the car. Dragon Spirit was sitting at the bottom of the car, lowering his head and not looking at himself.\n\n\n\n\"I'm going to bother you again, Miss Wisdom.\" Nian Bing said politely.\n\n\n\nLuo Rou said unhappily: \"Are you laughing at me? Don't worry, if you lose, you will lose. I will fulfill the agreement. You can make a request now.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment and said, \"I have never thought of asking you to answer any conditions. Just a word, why should I be true?\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou snorted and said, \"I'm willing to pay attention. Since I have already done so, I will naturally have to fulfill my words. Who would tell you that it's a saying. Although I'm a woman, I won't be afraid of it.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"No need, I really don't want to ask for you.\"\n\n\n\nA strange light appeared in Luo Rou's eyes and she picked her up, \"You didn't ask me at the beginning. What would happen if your condition was to marry me to you? You could ask for this.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was startled and said with a smile: \"No, I don't want to be chased by a group of your followers behind you. Why, don't you already have a fiancé?\"\n\n\n\nLuo Ju said: \"You don't dare to do it? So what if you have a fiancé? I'm not married yet. You can pursue me. As long as you propose the conditions, I will naturally give you an opportunity.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment. He saw that Luo Rou seemed to be real. He stretched his arm to Luo Rou and said, \"Prick me and see if I'm dreaming? The wise lady actually took the initiative to ask me to pursue it, which is really hard to believe.\" Luo Rou burst out laughing and pressed Nian Bing's forearm for a moment. Nian Bing felt pain, so he hurriedly put his arm back and smiled bitterly, \"Don't be that powerful.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou snorted and said, \"Who has kept you hidden so deeply that I have even cheated you. It's still light. I want to kill you. I feel very comfortable winning me?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's heart was slightly reminiscent, and he laughed, \"I have to admit that it is indeed very fulfilling, but I don't mean to be proud of this.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou stared at him and said, \"You can propose conditions now. Can you say, I am not at all attractive to you?\"\n\n\n\nLooking at Luo Rou's clear blue eyes, at that moment, Nian Bing suddenly understood many things. Luo Rou did not like herself, but wanted to fight again with herself on another stage. If she proposed the condition of pursuing her or the condition of marrying her, I am afraid that the troubles that followed would be more difficult than each other. It was better than a wise woman, but it was indeed not simple. Her passionate desire is especially strong for a man, but since she understands this, how can she become accustomed to it? \"Miss Wisdom, the conditions you owe me have been fulfilled.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou was stunned, but she quickly understood, stared at Nian Bing and said, \"You are so traitorous.\" Isn't Nian Bing's slap in front of her? Isn't it a condition?\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked innocent and said, \"I'm a traitor? I won, it's not a problem for you. It's really unreasonable for you to say that I'm a traitor. I think I'm still good to get off the car.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou finally couldn't keep her calmness and said angrily, \"You let me sit, you don't have to move. I deserve your defense? Can you tell me that I'm a fierce beast?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled silently and sat there and stopped whispering. Luo Rou faced the handsome man who was so soft and uneasy in front of him. Even though he was full of wisdom, he was useless at all, and he couldn't help but feel angry.\n\n\n\nAlong the way, the three of them were not at the door of the magicians' meeting. Nian Bing got off the car the first time, held the dragon spirit level that was following him, and said to the wise woman in the car, \"Miss, thank you for seeing you, let's see you again.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou said fiercely: \"Nianbing, remember that I have never finished with you. One day, we will see you again. Let's go.\"\n\n\n\nThe horse flew away, and Nian Bing helplessly snatched his head, \"The woman's heart, the underwater rays, is really hard to understand! It seems that there is no grudge between me and her, so why bother to keep being in trouble with me?\"",

    "content": "Repost this chapter and there is no problem with this response.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLong Ling finally opened her mouth, \"Rou has been extremely smart since childhood. No matter what, as long as she wants to learn, she will learn in the shortest time, from small to adulthood. No matter whether it is a man or a woman, no one can win her. She is very strong. You have asked her to eat the phone several times, and you are so enthusiastic and curious about you, which will naturally make her pay more attention to you. You will never be able to get rid of it. In the future, there will be more trouble.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said indifferently, \"Then it's hard for her. I don't care about these.\" Anyway, after learning the magic knowledge here, I will leave, or maybe I will never meet Luo Rou again in the future. These are no longer important. \"Spirit, let's go in. I'll continue to go back to the library to study.\"\n\n\n\n\"Wait a minute.\" Long Ling called out Nian Bing, who was about to turn away, and his eyes showed a look of hesitation.\n\n\n\nNian Bing asked, \"What? Is there anything else?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling bit his lower lip and said, \"Nian Bing, is this true? Is your main job really a chef, not a magician?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. He understood what Long Ling was worried about and said softly, \"Spirit, you heard me. It's true that the chef is my main job, but so is the magician. These two are inseparable relationships. Although my chef cannot be said to be the best in the mainland, at least it is also It's first-class, but my magic is still far from the bottom of it, so, now, for me, all I need to know in a moment, and magic is something that needs to be learned more. You can rest assured that since you have joined the trade association, since I have promised you to help the trade association before, I will definitely do it. I am a man.\" \n\n\n\nAfter hearing Nian Bing's words, Long Ling finally relaxed her voice, took the initiative to grab Nian Bing's big hand, and said with emotion: \"Thank you, Nian Bing, I, I really don't know what to say.\"\n\n\n\nLooking at Long Ling's extremely tenderness, Nian Bing's heart was filled with tenderness, and she subconsciously held her hand tightly and said, \"No need to say anything. The industry has improved me so conveniently. This is what I should do.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling suddenly felt a sudden disappointment in her heart. She felt that she wanted to hear Nian Bing say that all this was for you.\n\n\n\n\"Nian Bing and Ling, are you back?\" The dissonant voice of Master Jiu made a thorn in his heart at the same time. Nian Bing was busy opening Long Ling's hand. For him, who had a longer goal, it was definitely an unwise choice to offend Shi Jiu now.\n\n\n\n\"Brother Master Nine, we are back.\" Nian Bing glanced at Long Ling deeply and walked into the Magician Association first.\n\n\n\nTeacher Jiu met up with some dissatisfaction and said, \"What have you been to? Why did you go there for so long? I went to the library to find you and heard that you were out.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"Miss Luo Rou just asked me to go with her to Qingfeng to explain the matter to Miss Xue Jing. So Ling was there, so Miss Luo Rou invited her to go with her. So, I'll send us back.\"\n\n\n\nTeacher Jiuyi didn’t hear that Nian Bing and Long Lingxing went out alone. Their face looked a little better at the time. \"It’s better to explain it before going out in the future, so that I won’t worry.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Brother, I'll go back to the library first. You can chat with Ling'er.\" After saying that, he strides away. \n\n\n\nLong Ling had already walked into the trade fair at this time. The teacher Jiu Xing rushed forward, \"Heaven, you have been away for a long time, and I am almost in a hurry. I bought you two new headpieces. I think it is especially suitable for you. Let's go and go and have a look. I think you will definitely like it.\"\n\n\n\nLooking at the earnest face of Master Jiu, Long Ling couldn't really get interested, but her gentle nature made her unable to resist her junior brother. Just when she didn't know what to do, Long Zhi's voice suddenly came, \"Xiao Jiu, why don't you practice magic in the room properly? Why do you run out to fuck?\"\n\n\n\nWhat Master Jiu feared most was this magician level teacher. When he saw Long Zhi coming, he hurriedly said respectfully: \"Mr. Master, Ling and Nian Bing have just left. I was a little anxious, so I waited for them here.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi glanced at Long Ling and said with a brow, \"Since they have come back now, you can continue to practice your cultivation. Look at the person who is chanting Bing, who is ten years younger than you and has entered the realm of a great magician. I will give you another one year. If you can't reach the level of a great magician, don't say you are my disciple in the future.\"\n\n\n\nWhen he saw Long Zhi angry, Master Jiu was so scared that he didn't dare to let out. He hurriedly said, \"Yes, Master, I'll go back to meditate now.\" After saying that, he hurriedly walked away.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi saw that Master Jiu left, and his face looked calm and down, walked to his baby girl, and smiled and said, \"Are you and Nian Bing out?\"\n\n\n\n\"Dad.\" Long Ling relaxed when she saw her father, who had been preparing to pay for the nervousness of Master Jiulu, and she relaxed. \"I just went to clear the wind with Nian Bing.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi said, \"Nian Bing has been so hard these days, so you should go out for more walks. You have been very careful since you were a child and should take more attention to his daily life. Yes, what do you think of Nian Bing?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling was stunned for a moment and said, \"He is very good! He is very enlightened, and he has a high understanding, even if he is not even soft and gentle, he is also very good, although it is a bit mysterious.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi smiled and said, \"Men must be like Nian Bing. So they should start a business and then start a family. If a man has no ability, he can only be a mediocre life. I also think Nian Bing's child is very good.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling hesitated for a moment, but decided to tell her father the matter, \"Dad, actually Nian Bing has another job...\" At that time, she said in detail everything she had previously lived in the wind. Long Zhi heard his daughter's face change. He never expected that Nian Bing, who had high expectations, would be a chef. Although he did not disagree with the chef, he certainly did not want Nian Bing to waste his energy on other places. \"..., that's it. However, Nian Bing said that his art has reached a certain level and it seems that there is no need to practice anything anymore. What is needed more is to practice magic. Uncle Xue seems to be very concerned about Nian Bing. I'm afraid he will come here as soon as he gets there.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi's eyes flashed, \"No wonder I always thought that Nian Bing seemed to have something to worry about. It turned out that he was still a chef. Now I understand everything, no wonder he was clearing the wind.\"\n\n\n\nAs the voice fell, Mati's voice suddenly came from outside. Long Zhi smiled bitterly and said, \"My brother Xue has always been anxious. It seems that he has arrived. Ling Er, go in first, I will have everything.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling replied that she had always had blind trust in her father. When she said that she felt much more comfortable, she turned around and headed towards the library.\n\n\n\nAs soon as Long Ling left, Xue Jin and Xue Jing and Xue Jing walked into the Magicians' Association. The magicians who were obsessed with looking at the door thought that they would not be blocked. \n\n\n\nLong Zhi laughed, \"What kind of wind is blowing away Brother Xue and niece, it really makes me feel tired!\"\n\n\n\nXue Ji strode to Long Zhi and smiled bitterly, \"I'm not going to do anything to the Three Baby Hall! I came here this time, because I have something to do and want to ask Brother Qian to help me.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi's eyes flashed and he said, \"Brother, if you want Nian Bing to come to you to be a chef, don't say it. You already have Mingyuan there, and I can't lack him here!\"\n\n\n\nXue was stunned for a moment. He had a deep friendship with Long Zhi. Naturally, he understood that if Long Zhi spoke so much, there would be no room for discussion. He never expected that Nian Bing would be so important to Long Zhi. Despite this, he still tried to investigate: \"Brother, Nian Bing is a chef. To be sure, he will definitely be a great chef in the future, so...\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi suddenly said, \"Brother, maybe Nianbing's chef is really very high, but I can tell you that as the great magician who Nianbing's most powerful magician, he will also be a great magician in the future. He has joined my trade, and when you are cutting wood, I will definitely not let him leave.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing was holding a box in her hand, watching her father and Long Zhijing look at her father and Long Zhijing, and she couldn't help but feel a little sad. Not long ago, Nian Bing, who had just been nothing in his eyes, became a talent for his father and Long Zhi to compete. The contrast is too big. When it comes to knowing people, I am really far from being bad.Nian Bing, Nian Bing, I really don’t know if I hate you or…\n\n\n\nXueqiu snatched his head helplessly and said, \"Forget it, I actually have no hope this time. Even if you don't stop it, I'm afraid Nian Bing will not go to my little house. I was wrong before, but he actually let him chop firewood by clearing the wind. I will always blame him this time.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi said with some confusion: \"Just paying off? Brother, you also know that our magicians will be getting worse now. I have no choice but to have such a talent after finally having it!\"\n\n\n\nXue Ni smiled indifferently and said, \"Okay, brother, don't you know what brother is like? I just want to see him and then leave. Even if it can't be used by me, please make friends.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi had a red face. It was true that he was too nervous about Nian Bing. He hurriedly opened the road and said, \"Brother, I will take you there. He is in the library.\"\n\n\n\nIn the third floor of the library, Nian Bing sat on the ground, focusing on reading the magic information in his hand. As long as he started the book, he would not think about anything else. Although there were a lot less books in the third floor, the knowledge contained in it was more profound and profound, and it was impossible to fully understand it in one day or two days. He had already developed a strong interest in magic weapons, and he would not stop until he knew it was clear.\n\n\n\nLong Ling looked at Nian Bing as if she was a little stunned. She saw that under her concentration, he attracted her the most. Although he would never look at him when reading the book, his handsome face had long been deeply engraved into his brain. Long Ling has always believed in fate and was born in a magical family. She has learned magic from her father since she was a child and can't talk about anything about her interest. She thinks that this is her own fate. Since it is fate, it must continue. Mr. Jiu is her junior brother and has been pursuing her. Mr. Jiu is indeed very good to her. When Long Ling believed that this was fate. When he grew up, he would definitely marry this junior brother who was ten years old. However, since Nian Bing appeared, the fate she believed had already shattered. When Nian Bing successfully made a magic roll and showed a confident smile on her face, Long Ling knew that she was completely attracted by the unobtrusive smile. She felt a palpitation for the first time in her heart, which was an indescribable feeling. Every day, although she was just looking at Nian Bing quietly, her heart was very satisfied. As long as she looked at him, she would forget everything. At the beginning, Long Ling was still a little scared. She was afraid of the feeling in her heart. However, when she saw the artwork born in Nian Bing's hands today - Jiuqing Shenlong Bingyun, the fear in her heart suddenly disappeared. She knew very clearly that she had fallen deeply in love with this man, this mysterious man. Although he is not very strong, every point of his is deeply attracted to him. If you want to say that he has any shortcomings, it may be a disinterested attitude. He seemed to care nothing except magic and art, even if he was afraid of the brilliance and wisdom like soft.As her feet sounded, Long Ling couldn't help but look slightly. What she didn't want the least was someone to slap herself and Nian Bing, stand up, carefully without any movement, and look down the building. I happened to see my father walking up the building with Xue Xiang and his daughter. \"Uncle Xue, calm, you are here.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing looked at Long Ling with a strange look, \"Spirit, are you also learning magic in the library? I remember you said two years ago that you have read all the books here.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling had a pretty face and said, \"I am learning from him about Nian Bing's understanding of magic.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi felt aroused. He could see the little girl's mind the most clearly. He smiled and said, \"I am also taking care of the mind. After all, he has worked so hard every day. How can he be without anyone taking care of his daily life? If Ling Er hadn't reminded him every day, he would probably not be able to eat. I would have admired this child's concentration.\"\n\n\n\nXue Ji looked at Long Zhi, and Long Zhi was also looking at him. It was obvious that there was a hint of complacent look in Long Zhi's eyes. Xue Ni shook his head helplessly, it was obvious that in terms of relationship, he was already inferior. Nian Bing was just a chopping firewood in Qingyan, and when he arrived at the magician, he became a treasure. Long Zhi even sent his daughter to serve him without any hesitation. Compared with the two, the difference was that it was too far away. Alas, he was really. If he had seen Nian Bing's true ability earlier, it would not have caused the current situation.\n\n\n\nXue Jin and Xue Jing walked to Nian Bing. Although Nian Bing was very focused, the two people standing beside him would never be able to see each other. When they raised their heads and saw Xue Jin and his daughter, a shock appeared in their eyes. They hurriedly stood up and said, \"Mr. Xue Jin, why are you here?\"",

I'm truly ashamed! To think I had you chopping firewood at the Clear Wind Pavilion before.\"\n\nNian Bing thought to himself, *You don't look any younger than my master, yet you call him 'Senior.' How amusing.* \"Mr. Xue, you're too kind. I was the one who didn't reveal my identity, so how could I possibly blame you? There isn't really a place to sit here, I'm terribly sorry.\"\n\nXue Ji sighed softly. \"I've always prided myself on my ability to judge people, but this time I was so mistaken. I came here today to apologize for the poor treatment you received at the Clear Wind Pavilion, as well as for my daughter's foolishness. My daughter was truly just fooling around back then, making you pretend to be her boyfriend. Speaking of which, with a talent like yourself, how could my daughter possibly be worthy?\"\n\nNian Bing still held a favorable impression of Xue Ji. \"You flatter me, Mr. Xue, you're being far too polite. As long as Miss Xue Jing no longer resents Nian Bing for his deception, then Nian Bing will be satisfied.\"\n\nXue Ji smiled. \"You are all young people; you should interact more in the future. In terms of culinary arts, even Brother Ming admits he is your inferior. Jing'er is my only daughter, and this Clear Wind Pavilion will be hers to inherit one day. If she could learn more about the culinary arts from you, I could rest easy entrusting the Clear Wind Pavilion to her.\" *Long Zhi, you have a daughter, do I not? My daughter's looks are no worse than yours. Unfortunately, my daughter's temper really is a bit lacking. This Nian Bing not only has superb culinary skills but also possesses considerable magic, and his character seems to be quite good...*\n\n\"Father.\" Xue Jing's pretty face blushed slightly. She glanced at her father, then at Nian Bing, and shyly lowered her head. At this moment, she didn't look like a wild girl at all.\n\nXue Ji chided her, \"Hurry up and apologize to Nian Bing. You, you've really been too much of a troublemaker.\"\n\nXue Jing looked at Nian Bing again and hesitated, but she just couldn't bring herself to say the words of apology. Nian Bing said, \"An apology isn't necessary. Miss Xue Jing didn't do anything wrong. I just hope that the young lady might consider improving her temper a bit. It's better for a girl to be a little gentler.\" As he spoke, he glanced at Long Ling beside him. Among the three great beauties of Ice Snow City, the one who had left the deepest impression on Nian Bing was undoubtedly the \"Wise Beauty,\" Luo Rou. However, the one he had the best feeling about was the gentle and lovely Long Ling.\n\nXue Jing glared at Nian Bing, but with her father present, she didn't dare say a word. Xue Ji sighed inwardly. In terms of temperament, his daughter truly couldn't compare to Long Ling at all! Taking the brocade box from Xue Jing's hands, he said to Nian Bing, \"A small gift, just a token of our regard. Please accept it, Nian Bing. Although I know you probably won't return to the Clear Wind Pavilion, I still hope you can be a friend to us.\" As he spoke, Xue Ji presented the brocade box to Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing didn't accept it. \"Mr. Xue, why be so polite? I cannot accept this gift. The Clear Wind Pavilion did nothing wrong. Master Ming and I already have a connection, so naturally, I am a friend of the Clear Wind Pavilion.\"\n\nXue Ji smiled. \"As the saying goes, a treasured sword is gifted to a worthy warrior. This item is a Xue family heirloom. My older brother inherited our father's title, while I inherited this. To me, it doesn't have much use, but I think for you, it will be of some help. Please, accept it. Consider it a small token of my goodwill.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head. \"Now that you've said that, I have even more reason not to accept it. Since this is your family heirloom, Mr. Xue, it should rightfully be inherited by Miss Xue Jing.\"\n\nXue Ji smiled. \"Since you've already agreed to be a friend of the Clear Wind Pavilion, you shouldn't call me Mr. Xue anymore. If you don't mind, call me Uncle. I won't force you, but... aren't you curious to see what it is? Although this brocade box is wrapped in cloth, the inside is cast from lead to prevent the aura of the item within from leaking out.\"\n\nLong Zhi thought to himself, *This isn't good.* From Xue Ji's words, the brocade box had to contain a treasure. In this matter, he had acted too late. He never expected Xue Ji to value Nian Bing so highly as to bring out a family heirloom, while he himself had accepted quite a few scrolls from Nian Bing. It seemed that after they left, he would have to take some action himself.\n\nSure enough, although Nian Bing was mature for his age, he still possessed a young man's curiosity. He subconsciously looked at the brocade box in Xue Ji's hands. Xue Ji smiled faintly and unfastened the clasp. The moment the box opened, the entire room was instantly filled with a cyan light. Even the flow of air in the room became noticeably stronger. It was the aura of wind, the aura of the wind element. The wind element in the room rapidly converged into the box, making the cyan light even more intense. The wind seemed to be moaning softly, the humming sound so beautiful.\n\nLong Zhi was completely shaken. As a Wind Magister, how could he not recognize it? His voice trembled slightly. \"This... this is a Wind's Chant Stone! The legendary stone said to be condensed from the Wind God's immense power during his pained moans! Only a Wind's Chant Stone could emit such an intense aura of the wind element. Brother Xue, you've really kept this hidden from me!\"\n\nXue Ji smiled faintly. \"My brother, if it were just a Wind's Chant Stone, what would be the harm in giving it to you? You know your elder brother has always been generous; I wouldn't hoard a worldly possession I have no use for. Both Jingjing and I have fire-attribute bodies, with a focus on fire, so we have no use for it. But the reason I never gave it to you, or even showed it to you, is because it's not just a Wind's Chant Stone. It's a knife. A knife inlaid with a Wind's Chant Stone that can bring speed to its absolute extreme. Its name is Aotian, and it has a title: The Gentle Chant of the Free Wind.\"\n\nFinally, the long brocade box was fully opened. Perhaps because it had been sealed for so long, the wind element pulsed wildly, bathing the entire library in a cyan hue. It was a knife, one foot seven inches long and three inches wide at the blade. The shape of the knife was very peculiar. It did not curve upwards like a normal knife, but the perfect arc of the cutting edge showed that it was indeed a knife. The blade was extremely thin, less than one-seventh of an inch even at its thickest point. Along the edge, neat spiral patterns ran from the base all the way to the tip. The most distinctive feature of this knife was the lack of a handguard; the blade extended directly down into the handle. The handle was equally strange, with four deep grooves, obviously for the fingers. Above the grooves for the index and middle fingers was a vertical indentation in the metal, perfectly suited for a firm grip. At the end of the handle, a dark green gemstone protruded outwards in a circular shape. The entire knife emitted a strong cyan light, but as time passed, the light gradually began to recede.\n\nThe radiance of the blade was so wondrous. Nian Bing murmured, \"The Gentle Chant of the Free Wind—the Aotian Knife. It truly is a fine blade!\"\n\nXue Ji seemed to have anticipated his surprise and explained with a smile, \"The Wind's Chant Stone is indeed what makes this knife precious, but likewise, the knife itself is of the highest quality, forged from Wind Cyan Gold. Only this metal could be combined with the Wind's Chant Stone to form this Aotian Knife. The Aotian Knife has a soul. Although you are not a wind-element magician, a forceful slash can activate the wind element inherent in the knife, forming a simple wind blade. While it's no threat to high-level warriors, ordinary warriors would find it difficult to block. You are a magician; blocking an attack for even a moment should be enough time for you to chant a spell. Of course, this is just a secondary function of the Aotian Knife. Most importantly, it can allow you to achieve even greater speed when using your miraculous knife skills. If you had it when you were making that 'Nine Cyan Dragons Hidden in Icy Clouds' dish, you could have saved at least half the time. A famed knife for a famed chef. Since you don't have your master's True Sun Knife, this Aotian Knife is also very suitable for you. I dare say, in terms of quality, Aotian is in no way inferior to True Sun, and may even surpass it.\"\n\nLong Zhi moved closer to Xue Ji, looked at the dark green gemstone, and sighed. \"What a pity, what a pity. This Wind's Chant Stone has already completely fused with the metal of the knife; their auras are interconnected. Unless one merges with the knife's soul, it's impossible to bring out the stone's full properties. If I had a staff made from a Wind's Chant Stone, maybe I could also become a Divine Envoy within twenty years! Big Brother, it's a good thing you never showed this to me before. Otherwise, I'm afraid I really would have tried to dig this stone out to make a staff.\"\n\nXue Ji smiled faintly. \"You... never mind that the Wind Cyan Gold itself is so sturdy that even a spell of the tenth tier or higher couldn't break it. Even if you did manage to get the Wind's Chant Stone out, I'm afraid you wouldn't be able to find a matching material to make a staff. Wind Cyan Gold is excellent, but its innate aura of sharpness is too strong. It's only suitable for being a weapon.\"\n\nLong Zhi gave a wry smile. \"If it were a staff truly made from a Wind's Chant Stone, it would be a divine artifact. Forget it, forget it. It seems I'm not fated for such an opportunity! It's a pity Nian Bing isn't a wind-element magician. Otherwise, with a chef's familiarity with the nature of a knife, he would surely be able to unleash the power of the Wind's Chant Stone, allowing this knife to wield power like a magic staff. To be frank, giving this knife to Nian Bing is almost a waste...\"\n\nXue Ji smiled. \"It's no waste at all. Although Nian Bing's magic power is not of the wind element, he must be very familiar with magical elements, so he should be able to bring out some of its power. Besides, I'm giving him this knife to be his kitchen knife, not a magic staff! Nian Bing, why don't you try it?\"\n\nTo say the Aotian Knife held no attraction for Nian Bing would be impossible. The value of this knife was definitely above that of the True Sun Knife without its Flame God's Stone, and it was certainly no worse than Morning Dew. The quality of the blade alone was enough to move Nian Bing's heart. He walked over to Xue Ji's side and reached into the box. Before he even touched the knife, the strong wind element gave him a refreshing sensation. He gripped the grooves on the handle, a perfect fit for his hand. As the knife left the brocade box, Nian Bing suddenly felt as if his hand was enveloped by a faint breeze. With a slight flick of his wrist, the blade instantly conjured a flurry of afterimages that looked as real as the knife itself. So fast! When his wrist trembled, that faint wind completely merged with his hand. His original thirty-six cuts had become forty-nine. Indeed, Xue Ji was right; this knife could absolutely make him faster. All along, Nian Bing had believed his hand speed when wielding a knife had reached its limit, but if he had this Aotian Knife, that limit would surely be broken. With proper coordination, it was entirely possible to double his speed.\n\nThe Ice and Fire Homologous Power within his body seemed to rotate a little faster under the influence of the wind element's aura, but there was no rejection. After all, neither ice nor fire had any elemental conflict with wind.\n\nWith the Aotian Knife in hand, even someone with Xue Ji's eyesight could no longer count the number of afterimages. He said with satisfaction, \"Not bad, right? It really is suitable for you. As an extraordinarily skilled chef, how can you not have a fine knife to match? You are a magic chef; this Aotian is perfect for you. I hope The Gentle Chant of the Free Wind can sing even more freely in your hands.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"A fine knife, it truly is a fine knife. But I can't accept it.\" As he spoke, he placed The Gentle Chant of the Free Wind back into the lead-lined box.\n\nXue Ji's brow furrowed slightly. \"Don't you think it's very suitable for you? Why won't you take it?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Uncle, Nian Bing accepts your kind intentions, but this knife is simply too precious. Moreover, it's your family's heirloom. Its value is immeasurable. I really cannot accept it.\"\n\nXue Ji laughed. \"To face a treasure without greed... good. You are truly worthy of being the Ghost Chef's successor. Alright then, I won't give you this knife. Since it's useless for me to keep it, how about I sell it to you?\"\n\n\"Sell?\" Hearing this word, Nian Bing's heart couldn't help but pound. He truly loved this treasure that could increase his hand speed. He asked tentatively, \"Then how much are you selling it for?\" He of course understood that a treasure of this level was essentially priceless.\n\nXue Ji smiled faintly. \"That depends on who I'm selling it to. How about this: one hundred thousand purple-gold coins, plus you personally serving as head chef at our Clear Wind Pavilion for one month, and I'll sell you this Gentle Chant of the Free Wind.\"\n\n\"One hundred thousand purple-gold coins?!\" Xue Jing, Nian Bing, Long Ling, and Long Zhi couldn't help but exclaim in unison.\n\nLong Zhi gave a wry smile. \"Even if you sold my entire Magic Guild, it would probably only be worth that much.\" You have to understand, purple-gold coins were rarely used; gold coins were the common currency. One hundred thousand purple-gold coins was a full one million gold coins!\n\nXue Ji smiled faintly. \"What? You think it's expensive? Of course, if Nian Bing is willing to condescend to work at the Clear Wind Pavilion for five years, he can also have the knife.\"",

At the same time, when you get essay, I hope that book lovers will vote more, collect, especially VIP votes, thank you.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n  Yin, it is definitely yin. Long Zhi looked at Xue Jin, who was in a profound and unsightly face, and felt dissatisfied. When he proposed to send a knife to Nian Bing, he must have already calculated that Nian Bing would not want it. He is such an old fox! \"No, it's worth the price of Feng Yinshi alone. Even if you've worked for five years, it's totally worth it. However, the trade association needs to study Bing, Brother Xue, so don't make it difficult for you.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jin smiled slightly and said, \"Brother Long, don't miss it. I let him help me. In fact, it's not my place all day. You should know that Mingyuan is just an activist now. If Nian Bing is willing to go to me, all the treatment is the same as Ming Yuan. You only need to stay at night every day. Other times can be in your workplace. This condition is not harsh. Five years are not long.\" When he asked for the price, Xue Jin thought that Nian Bing could not have Nian Bing bought a knife.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi couldn't say that if he was Nian Bing, he would definitely have chosen this five years. After all, the arrival of an Absolute Blade is an absolute trick. If others change, Xue Yu will never pay such a big deal. Unfortunately, he was not Nian Bing, which was not wrong. Nian Bing really liked the gentle whisper of freedom, but he already had the ability to be the Chende Dew sword that was not under the Aotian Sword. The Chende Dew with the Bing attribute is more suitable for Nian Bing. In addition, it is possible to achieve the Yang Knife that is the same level as Chende Dew, and his desire for Aotian Sword is not that strong. What's more, he still has his own capital. \n\n\n\nNian Bing opened her mouth, smiled calmly, and said, \"I want this knife. Its price is more than the price my uncle said. I know that my uncle wants to give me an opportunity. If I don't love me, I don't deserve to be your friend.\"\n\n\n\nXue was very happy, \"Okay. You agreed to work there for five years now. Don't worry, I will give you the salary as well. As long as you are here, the wind will definitely become more popular. It will come. No matter when, even if the five-year agreement is completed, as long as you are tired outside, the wind will always be your home. You can live here. I said this sentence, whether I'm cleaning the wind or calmly in charge of the wind in the future, I will fulfill it.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Uncle, I think you've misunderstood. I really want this knife, but it's not the kind of method you imagine now. I can work for Qingfeng for a month, and at the same time, provide 100,000 purple gold coins. That is the first condition you mentioned earlier.\"\n\n\n\nXue was stunned and said, \"Do you have 100,000 purple gold coins? Could it be that the ghost knight left it to you?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing slammed his head and said, \"No, no, although the teacher left me a lot of property, as a man, I will never use other people's money to buy what I want. I will use my ability to get this freestyle whisper. Although I don't have 100,000 gold coins yet, if I can provide items of equal amounts to exchange, it should be fine.\"\n\n\n\nThe matter has come out of Xue Yan's previous calculations. He couldn't help but look at his eyebrows and said, \"What do you want to exchange it?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Uncle, I think you may also know something about magic. The precious magic rolls have always been worth a lot. If it is an eleventh-level magic rolls that only come to God's subjugation, can it be worth 100,000 purple gold coins?\"\n\n\n\nAfter clicking a little, Xue Jin said, \"The eleventh level magic rolling axle is probably more than this price, but, as far as I know, even if it is a priest of the Ice and Snow Goddess, it is impossible to create a level ten or above magic rolling axle. How can you have it?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said with a head start: \"No, I don't have it. However, I can make rolls. Although I can't reach level 11 in the stage, the rolls I make can have the same value. I am willing to provide you with ten rolls, ten rolls that I can make the most proud in three months. I think their value should be enough to top at least two eleventh rolls. This is also my favor.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jin said with some confusion: \"Nian Bing, it's not that I can't believe you, but, depending on your appearance, I am just a great magician. As far as I know, the great magician can make fourth-level ripple, and the chance is very low, with a difference of seven levels. The value of ripple...\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing cut off the snow and smiled and said, \"No, I am a great magician, but I can make six levels of rolling. Moreover, the reason why I believe that my rolling can be worth the price is that it naturally has certain characteristics. The power it can exert will surely surprise you, and the most precious thing is This kind of rolling axle cannot be done by others. Even the Snow Goddess Priest, which is now called magic the most powerful, cannot be sacrificed. Unless I tell the method of rolling axle, who will not reach the level of making it. \"In order to get the Aotian Sword, Nian Bing has no choice but to hide the secret he just learned.\n\n\n\nXue Qing smiled, \"Nian Bing, I believe in you. From the fact that Long Zhi values you, you can see that you have also achieved extraordinary achievements in the magic world, but you have ignored the most important point. Our Xue family protects itself with martial arts. Even with your powerful magic ripple, it will have no effect on us. Is it hard to say, are you counting on me to exchange them for money? If you think the things you make are worth the price, why don't you sell them?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said calmly: \"Because I don't want outsiders to know the secret of this rolling shaft, so I don't want to sell them out, but to directly exchange the Aotian Knife with you.Since I dare to propose such a exchange, I will naturally consider everything. The biggest feature of the rolling shaft I do is that it can be used by anyone, even if it is just a sensible child. Once I teach him the method of using it, it can also exert the power of the rolling shaft. \"\n\n\n\n\"What?\" Xue Jin and Long Zhi exclaimed in surprise. In their eyes, this was absolutely impossible.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and took out a roll from the air. This roll was made of the lowest-level white roll. He handed the roll to Xue Jing and smiled and said, \"Let's have a practical experience. Things can often prove everything. Miss Xue Jing, please follow what I said and open the rolling axle to the ceiling.\"\n\n\n\nXue was stunned and said, \"How to fight?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"You just need to spread the rolling axis like the painting axis, so that the picture faces upwards.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing's eyes showed a shocking light. According to Nian Bing, the rolling wheel would open. A strange scene appeared. When the axle was fully opened, the axle suddenly turned into a white mist. With a puff, dozens of ice skates appeared, turning into dozens of cold lights and directly inserted into the top of the room. Just as the crowd was still immersed in surprise, the dozens of ice skates on the top of the room suddenly turned into a piece of ice fog, and a large piece of ice condensed from the top of the room.\n\n\n\nAlthough Long Zhi had heard that Nian Bing could make a fusion roll, he still couldn't help but talk loudly when he saw it for the first time. More importantly, this roll was opened by Xue Jing, who could not magically at all. This creation has made the value of this rolling roll worth a lot. If this rolling roll is sold to the royal family and princes and ministers of various empires, the sales will definitely be very good. Who doesn't want to carry something good to save his life? \n\n\n\nNian Bing's eyes turned to the somewhat dull Xue Yan and smiled, \"Uncle, you have seen my rolling axes. If there are ten rolling axes around you, it will play a good role in protecting the lives and safety of you and Miss Xue Jing. Of course, you can rest assured that the rolling axes I provide to you must be of level 6 and level 6. I will explain what the two magics each rolling axes are. When you encounter danger, you only need to open the rolling axes, which will naturally keep you safe.\"\n\n\n\nXueqi smiled bitterly and slammed her head, saying, \"Nianbing, although I don't know how difficult it is to do this, the Lianlong brothers are so surprised, and it's worth the price of this kind of rolling axle. It's not difficult to sell ten sixth and sixth grade rolling axle to 100,000 purple gold coins. However, you should know that what I want is not these, and I really hope you can come and clear the wind to help me.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at the desire in Xue Yan's eyes, smiled indifferently, and said, \"Although Aotian is valuable, for me, the value of freedom is higher. I can't give up my freedom to get the sway of freedom. In five years, for me, it's actually too long. In fact, if it weren't for some special reasons, I would have left the Ice City.My teacher once told me that I have been practicing the chef for eight years and gaining the chef for eight years. Only by traveling throughout the entire mainland can I understand this word. I hope you can understand my difficulties. If you don’t want to exchange, I won’t be strong, I am still a friend of Qingfeng. \"\n\n\n\nXue Jin sighed and said, \"What I said is like water. Since I, Xue Jin, have already expressed the conditions, I will never regret it. Just follow what you said. After you have finished the rolling axle, you will teach my daughter directly. I think you will be a calm wedding dress for these ten rolling axle. When are you ready to start the wind cleaning work? Although it is only one month, I still have to make good use of it. I think you will not refuse some of my arrangements.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled confidently and said, \"If your arrangement means that I can discuss cooking art with other chefs, and I can't ask for anything, how can I refuse it? However, I hope the chef you are looking for is not too bad, otherwise, I will be very happy. Starting tomorrow, every evening, I will be on the verge of clearing the wind.\"\n\n\n\nXue Ni clicked the head and handed the box in his hand to Nian Bing, saying, \"Now, although it is not entirely yours, I can hand it over to you first. I believe in your character. To be honest, Nian Bing is really easy to talk to you. There are many things that don't need to be said explicitly. I finally understand why our wise ladies in Ice City will be in your hands. Calm, let's go.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing was very excited, and she was not overwhelmed because the sword that should have inherited had fallen into Nian Bing's hands. Her beautiful eyes flipped, she gave Nian Bing a blank look and said, \"Then we'll see you tomorrow. Then I will find you a set of clothes that suit you.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jin and Xue Jing left, holding a heavy box in their hands. Nian Bing was also very excited. Although the function of the Aotian sword was not as important as Chen Lu, now he needed to hide Chen Lu's breath. It was always a pity that he didn't have a good knife to help. Aotian, when he arrived at this time, happened to replenish this regret. With Aotian in his hand, Nian Bing firmly believed that his sword skills would definitely be further improved. Some sword techniques that he dared not try before can now start to fight.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi's eyes were full of light. He looked at Nian Bing and whispered, \"To be honest, I was really afraid that you would agree to the five-year agreement, but I have no right to ask you to refuse. Nian Bing, I now can't see through you. What exactly is your brain made of? After you arrive, you will explore the magic of magic one by one. I know that you will leave Ice City one day. I will not stop you. I just hope that when you leave, I want me to say goodbye and always remember that I am a member of the Magicians Association of the Ice Moon Empire, which is enough.\" \n\n\n\nI thought I had a little start and said, \"President, don't worry, since I have joined the trade association, I am a part of the trade association. I will definitely report it if you have helped me so much. I want to continue reading the book, so you can be busy.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi said, \"Then I won't beat you anymore. If you have any questions, even if you tell Ling, I will meet your request as much as possible.\" After speaking, he pulled Long Ling down the building.\n\n\n\nNian Bing picked up the book he had read before, as if he had never had anything before, and the box was placed beside him. He continued to learn about magic, the deeper he studied, the more he had a deep understanding of it, and those were what he needed the most.\n\n\n\nLong Ling followed his father to leave the library. Long Zhi looked at the surrounding area and said in a low voice, \"Sheng, I want to discuss something with you.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling was stunned and said, \"Dad, just tell me if you have anything, as long as Ling Ling can do it.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi said lightly, \"I am becoming more and more like this Nian Bing is not simple now. He has brought me too many surprises. Such talents are exactly what our trade association needs. If he can represent the trade association to participate in the triennial New Magicians Competition of the Five Great Empires in Mainland China, it will definitely change the status of our Ice Moon Empire Magicians Association in Mainland China. Unfortunately, I am afraid that he will not stay until that time! Originally, I wanted you to participate, but the appearance of Nian Bing has changed my mind.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling said with a eyebrows: \"Dad, although we can participate in that new magician conference, we are always affiliated with the Ice God Tower. With the Ice God Tower being present, we can't even extinguish anything!\"",

The Xinqiu Magician Championship has very strict requirements. Participants must be under 25 years old. Even participants sent by the Ice God Tower cannot win the championship every time. After all, it's hard to have strong power for young magicians. However, it's different for the Ice Ice. Now the distance is The Magician Conference has only one year since its beginning. With his current situation, with the help of various magical data from this trade association, he may be able to improve to what extent. It is very likely that it will be impossible. If he can win the championship, our trade association can also be proud of the Empire. It will be no easier for the Ice God Tower to suppress us.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling said in confusion: \"You should say these words to Nian Bing! What's the use of telling me?\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi smiled slightly and said, \"Of course it's useful. Ling, since your mother passed away, your father has always been carrying you. You are the treasure in your father's heart. To be honest, Dad attaches great importance to the trade association, but you are definitely an equivalent existence with the trade association. If I ask you a question now, you must answer me in a serious manner. Do you like to think about Bing?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling never expected that his father would ask such a problem. His pretty face was waxing and lowered his head shyly, playing with his clothes with both hands, and he couldn't say anything.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi smiled and said, \"What? Don't you say anything? Can't you attract my daughter if you are young talents like Nian Bing? Baby daughter, your conditions should not be too high. Think about it, if you can marry Nian Bing, it would be convenient to eat in the future.\"\n\n\n\n\"No, dad.\" Long Ling lowered his head and stuttered, \"Dad, Nian Bing is indeed very outstanding, but we only realized that this short time is so how can we say that we like or dislike it? Don't force yourself!\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi laughed and said, \"Okay, okay, no, I'll go and talk to Luo Rou to see if she is interested in Nian Bing.\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't.\" Long Ling raised her head anxiously and looked at her father, \"Dad, don't! I, I...\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi looked at his daughter with a smile and said, \"What, is Spirit trying to tell me?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling said angrily, \"Dad, you are so bad. It's OK, I admit that I have a good impression of Nian Bing. However, you can also see that he doesn't seem to care about anything other than magic and art.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi relaxed his voice and said, \"As long as you like him, everything else is fine. Although Dad is a little utilitarian, he will never let his daughter marry someone he doesn't love.Spirit, remember your father's words, happiness depends on your own struggles. If you really like Nian Bing, don't give up, and take action early. As long as you can grasp his heart, all problems will be solved. Do you understand what dad mean? \"\n\n\n\nLong Ling lowered her head again, \"But, Dad, he is actually a girl. How can you tell me what I am worried about?\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi snatched his head and smiled and said, \"Of course not. It's enough to move silently. After all, you are together every day now. I think my daughter is so beautiful, and Nian Bing is not a fool, so it's impossible to notice it. However, when necessary, you can also hint him. I can see that Xue Jing's head also has a good impression of Nian Bing. If Xue Xiao's old fox pushes and helps, things will be difficult. You won't want to give the person you love to your good friends.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling looked at his father with a little dazed glance, \"I, I don't know.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi smiled bitterly and said, \"Oh, forget it, so the matter is so smart. I'm a bit too utilitarian. You should always talk about the matters of young people. Let's go. However, Dad hopes that you can say that I'll go to the New Magician Conference for a year later, and other things will be discussed later.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling pointed at the head and said, \"Dad, I will do my best, but now I can't guarantee you what I want, because I don't know what Nian Bing is thinking. It's still very long a year, so I will definitely work hard. I also hope that the situation of the trade union will get better. Then I'll go first.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi clicked his head and said, \"Go, come to me tonight and take the white rolled cart I bought. Nian Bing needs it.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing flipped through the magic book in his hand. It was already late at night now. Long Ling was sitting at him and meditating nowhere. This book about various advanced magic venues finally turned to the last page. Nian Bing felt a little disappointed. Although the magic venues recorded in these magic books were good, they were a little worse than he thought, and there was no knowledge he wanted most.\n\n\n\nAfter a sigh of relief, he wanted to close the book, and suddenly he found that on the last page of the magic book, there was a special tag, which was clearly a magic symbol used to engrave one of the symbols of the magic ambient. This symbol represents the meaning of hiddenness.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's heart moved, condensed his magic power, and carefully cut towards the symbol in order.\n\n\n\nA faint blue light shone brightly. When he finished the last pen, the last night of the magic book was suddenly rendered blue, which belonged to ice. The characters on the page began to change, and the original symbols and text completely changed. \n\n\n\n\"Magic celestials are used to connect the magic of heaven and earth, balance various magic elements between heaven and earth, so that they can be better used by magicians. However, as a magician, in close combat is always a waste. When encountering a person with high martial arts cultivation, it is difficult to achieve success in one-to-one situation.In this case, the magic ambient can undergo a special transformation to form a special method. This method is engraved on the amplitude and assists the magic on the amplitude to play a special role. This type of method is called touch. The so-called touch means that when a person holding a magic rifle encounters a certain degree of attack, the rifle will automatically explode to protect his master. The attack level can be set by itself in the touch magic paradise. The magic paradise is as follows, please use it yourself. Special reminder, this method must be attached when the magic scroll has been completed. Once the attachment fails, the rolling shaft will automatically be reported, please use it with caution. \"\n\n\n\nSeeing this, Nian Bing's heart was alive at the moment. He finally understood why he was no longer afraid of a dispute with the warrior when the magician reached the level of a demon instructor. It was not because the magician's ability was strong enough, but because of the existence of such a touching magic! Once an enemy steals the magician, as long as the magician has such a special rolling axle, it will naturally resolve the crisis at that time and give the magician a certain time to chant spells. Good things, it is really good things. Please pay more attention to this, otherwise, if you let it go, this wonderful magic will slip away.\n\n\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing immediately devoted himself to the diamond. This special magical axe was very difficult to draw. Not only did it have a high requirement for magical control, but it also needed great magical power as support. It was much more difficult to plan such a touching magical axe than to draw a level six magical axe. \n\n\n\nIn fact, what Nian Bing didn't know is that the actual use of this magical axe is not widespread. Although there are records in magicians in various empires, it is extremely difficult to make this magical axe, and the success rate is even lower. The magical axe itself is extremely precious. Who would use the advanced axe to do the practical experience of this touching magic axe? That's too wasteful, so even if it is made, it can only be applied to some low-level magic, which has been abandoned by most magicians.\n\n\n\nThe most important reason why magicians can fight against warriors is that magicians who have reached the level of magicians often bring a lot of magical items, which the Magicians Association must match to protect high-level magicians. Among them, magic items used for warnings have always been the most popular, and of course, the price is also the most expensive. With this kind of magic item, the magician can predict the arrival of danger in advance to prepare for the right preparation. Even if the stealer is powerful, magicians at the level of magicians above the magician often have the strength to protect themselves. Then they use the time they get to chant powerful magic, which is the real reason why they can fight against warriors. Of course, under normal circumstances, magicians rarely act alone unless necessary and are accompanied by warriors, so that they can best protect their safety. When you have to act alone, unless you are a very self-reliant magician, you will generally choose to wear it to cover up your identity.Of course, this behavior is done secretly, otherwise it will inevitably be made fun of by colleagues.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's research is not a direct connection with the engraving method of the Dharma Gallery, but a direct study of the principles of this touch town. By being familiar with various magic symbols, you carefully find the principles of the touch hall. As long as you figure out the principle, you don't have to rely on deadly to use the Dharma Gallery. You can also apply it more flexibly, and you can even add your own things to it. Concentrating on studying is often the most time-consuming. When Nian Bing basically figured it out, the sky outside was already dawn. The feeling of fatigue spread throughout the body, but new results were developed, making Nian Bing feel extremely happy. \n\n\n\n\"Eat something.\" Long Ling's voice woke up Nian Bing, who was immersed in joy. He turned his head and saw Long Ling standing beside him, squatting down and carefully placing the plate on the ground. There were two croakers, a piece of rolled meat and a bowl of white porridge in the plate. Long Ling said with some slightest remark, \"I haven't slept yet another night. Can't I tell you, are these magical information really that attractive to you?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was about to reach out to grab the puff, but Long Ling opened his hand, \"You have dirty hands, wipe your hands first, wipe your face before eating.\" He said, and sent a soft towel to Nian Bing.\n\n\n\nThe towel was very wet, and it was very comfortable to hold in your hands, with a faint fragrance radiating on it. Nian Bing looked at Long Ling, and suddenly he felt very warm. This feeling could not be described in words. \"Spirit, thank you, you have been taking care of me for these days.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling smiled slightly and said, \"We are friends! Moreover, the more successful your research is, the more beneficial it will be for our trade associations. Nian Bing, the method of concentrating me is really useful. I clearly think that my magic control has increased recently, thank you.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"What's thankful for? It's your own efforts.\" Wiping your face with a towel and then drying your hands. Nian Bington felt much better when he felt better. I didn't sleep all night and my stomach was already hungry. I didn't think it was before. At this time, I felt relaxed and my stomach screamed. I swallowed it voraciously, and my plate was swept away. Although these were not delicious, they tasted particularly sweet at this time.\n\n\n\n\"Eat slowly, don't choke. In fact, if you don't eat well like this, you don't have any rules. If you think about ice, you need to rest more. If you have time, why should you hurry up for a while?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"You can't be anxious! After learning everything and fulfilling your agreement with Uncle Xuexi, I will leave here. It's not good for me to stay in the same place. My ambition is to travel to the world. It's better to travel thousands of miles to read books. Now my vision is too narrow.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling was in a slight head, \"Nian Bing, do you have to leave? Ice and Snow City is actually...\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing lowered his head and did not look at Long Ling's moving eyes. He pointed at it and said calmly, \"I must leave. When the teacher passed away, I promised him that he must become the best chef. In the eight years of the enlightenment, I have only taken the first step now.Spirit, thank you for your concern for me all the time, but the man is determined by all sides, maybe one day I will come back when I am tired. \"\n\n\n\nLong Ling said with a silence: \"Then I'll wait for you to come back.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's whole body shook, raised her head to look at Long Ling. From her gentle eyes, Nian Bing saw a lot, \"Spirit, don't be so good? I don't know when I will come back or whether I can come back. I understand your feelings, but I can't waste your life. Treat me as a visitor in your life. With your heart and mind, you will definitely find someone who is more suitable for you.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling bit her lip, held the tray and stood up quietly, and said in a low voice: \"I understand, I'm not worthy of you.\"\n\n\n\n\"No.\" Nian Bing stood up and grabbed Long Ling's shoulder with both hands, \"I'm not worthy of you, Ling. If you say you can't move me, then unless I'm the heart of the iron stone, but I can't have any repercussions now, there are still many things I have to do. Who doesn't know about future things, right? I don't want to discuss about feelings at all now, that's too extravagant for me.\"",

    "content": "Long Ling felt the heat in Nian Bingda's hands. It's hard to say, do you only have the art of cooking and magic in your heart?\n\n\n\nI chanted Bing and said: That's right, there are only art and magic in my heart, everything else can be filtered. I must focus my mind to achieve something.\n\n\n\nLong Ling sighed lightly, and she endured her own purity and did not let her own purity remain. She did not think of Bing. As a result, everyone's pursuit was different. Girls' greatest pursuit in their lives was undoubtedly to fight for a good life, but men were different. Some people were in a corner, while others were determined to be extraordinary. Nian Bing was obviously the latter. He had too many ideals and pursuits.\n\n\n\nLong Ling left, Nian Bing felt uncomfortable. He looked at the bookshelf around him with some confusion. It was not a comfortable thing to refuse a gentle and erotic girl. Just when his heart was in irritation, a look of anticipation suddenly flashed in the sea of his brain. Nian Bing's whole body shook and said in a lost voice: Mom, Mom, I'm wrong. I shouldn't be bothered by these things. The Ice God Tower is my goal. The desperate eyes made my memory so profound. It was my mother's last gaze. Nian Bing took a deep breath, and all kinds of chaotic thoughts in her heart disappeared. She sat down on her knees and began to meditate.\n\n\n\nFrom morning to noon, and from noon to evening, after a whole day of cultivation, Nian Bing woke up from meditation. The magic power of ice and fire with the same origin became more solid. Although the progress was slow, they were still stable. The clever spiral organically combined together and communicated with each other and did not conflict. This is the power of ice and fire with the same origin. Lifting his head and looking at the sky outside, at this time, the skylight had gradually darkened, and the magic light in the library was about to open. Nian Bing took out a two-four-level magic rolling axle from the sky. This scrolling axle is his most proud work at present. It will open the rolling axle, and the blue magic The force was injected into it, without any hesitation, the light blue light intersected above the rolling axle, and the blue light kept flashing. Every pattern was so wonderful, without any stopping, interspersed in the original magical ambient of the rolling axle, and the perfect work was gradually completed in Nian Bing's hands. The feeling of mental power made Nian Bing clearly know that the rolling shaft in his hand had already seen the effect of touching, but Nian Bing was very clear that his success was very important. As mentioned above, this touching method was extremely difficult to complete. Even though I have figured out its principles, I have missed a few times before. \n\n\n\nStand up and carefully put the rolling axle into the wound. He picked up the long hand-made box from the ground and sorted out his own appearance briefly. Nian Bing quietly left the library.\n\n\n\nLong Ling did not appear except for delivering food to herself at noon, Nian Bing knew. Although she didn't say it, she had already hurt her heart deeply and didn't see her well, so as not to fall into it too deeply.\n\n\n\nAs soon as he walked out of the Magicians Association, he arrived in front of Nian Bing on the bike and saw Nian Bing on the bus. It was the old carman who went to Luo Rou's house for the banquet with Xue Jing.Xue Jingyuan came out of the center of the car. Big chef, get on the car. Dad asked me to pick you up. I've been waiting for you for half a day. You're really slow.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly in her heart, and it was really a wave that had not yet subsided. Long Ling already understood his intentions, but this crazy girl was not that easy to beat. I hope she still hates herself for more, but unfortunately the swallow style she likes is actually a chrysanthemum. Otherwise, I could match it up, so that Xue Jing would not focus on himself. Nian Bing really dared not take it as Miss Xue Jing came to pick me up by herself. Although he said this, he still rode on the car.\n\n\n\nXue Jingyuan sat next to Nian Bing, with a sweet smile on her face, and she didn't dare to say that when did you become so polite? Wasn't you bullying me?\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly, \"Have I explained it clearly?\" Miss Xue Jing, can you let me go? There is no hatred between us.\n\n\n\nXue Jing smiled slightly and said, letting you go, then I have to consider it. However, the call between us needs to be changed first. I have called you directly. You call my father the only one. In the future, you can call me calm or calm. We are also friends. I have a small request that you will not refuse. I think when I call me Linger, I am very serious. \n\n\n\nNian Bing didn't want to do more trouble, so he hurriedly said, \"Okay, I'll just agree, calm, I won't have to send a car to pick me up in the future. I'll walk there myself, and I can also do my best to move my muscles.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing smiled and said. How to exercise your muscles and bones? ＞When you are in the evening, when you say that, she immediately felt that it was inappropriate and she had a big red face.\n\n\n\n  The health situation is true and you don’t understand. You can’t do anything difficult for me tonight, right?\n\n\n\nXue Jingwu vomited his cute little tongue and said, \"Is there any problem?\" My father just asked the boss of Dacheng to come and visit him, so they were just a challenging post.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's eyes lit up, are they challenging the main chef of Dacheng? OK, this is exactly what I hoped for. A strong fighting spirit arose from Nian Bing. On the somewhat dim horse, his eyes were like cold stars in the dark, flashing with the light of confidence, and putting the box with the Aotian Knife flat on his legs. Today, I happened to try this knife.\n\n\n\nFeeling the cold breath on Nian Bing's body, Xue Jing's heart was turbulent, and she felt so strongly confident. It turned out that she thought Nian Bing would make it difficult for Xue Zi to arrange the challenge. She never thought that Nian Bing would answer so easily, and she was still very excited. Of course, she didn't understand the heart of a top master in the art world. The opponent's feelings were the worst. With the opportunity, how could Nian Bing not be happy? When he first chose his first stop to Ice and Snow City, he wanted to compete with Qingfeng and the masters of Dazhi.\n\n\n\nYou seem to be very confident. Xue Jing looked at Nian Bing and felt a suffocation in her heart.\n\n \n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Do you have no confidence in me?\" What special abilities does Dacheng Jiao have?I think that if he can always compete with Qingfeng, his ability should not be inferior to Master Ming.\n\n\n\nThe snow was a little calm and said that the most popular place for Dacheng Zheng to become a officials is of course his reason. It is not just because they have some special services. The main reason is that their chef is very young, about thirty years old, and they are not sure about the taste of the dishes. Uncle Ming once compared with him once, but the result was a draw. The guy seemed to be good at cooking various meat and vegetable fields, and had to admit that the dishes he made were of color. The two words are more fragrant than Uncle Ming, but the taste is more heavy.\n\n\n\nNian Bingzhen said, I heard you say that the chef should follow the Huali route. Huali’s main focus is the word color and defense. Well, today I will compare with him and I can see that it is more beautiful and quiet. Have you seen the Yanfeng recently?\n\n\n\nXue was stunned for a moment, and she suddenly realized that since she hated Nian Bing, the name Yan Feng never appeared in the brain. How could he? I haven't seen it recently. I'm very surprised. Why did he treat you as a friend when you first met that day? Judging from his nature, it seems that he is not that easy to approach.\n\n\n\nNian Bing thought of Yan Feng's demeanor when he looked at his spirit, and his heart was cold and he smiled bitterly, \"Silent, I'll give you a suggestion, you'd better give him up, you won't have any results with him.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing said curiously, why do you say this, why don’t you be jealous of me for liking him?\n\n\n\n  envy? Nian Bing smiled and said, this word seemed to have never appeared in my brain. I'm for your own good. It's not my style to speak idle words behind people's backs, you'll understand in the future. \n\n\n\nXue Jinghu snorted and said. Things cannot be told to others. If you don’t say it clearly, then I can only think that you are jealous...\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"That's better if I'm jealous.\" After all, you are so beautiful, even if I am jealous, it is natural.\n\n\n\nWhen the horse was parked at the entrance of Qingfengmen, Nian Bing was surprised. The street was surprisingly quiet and got off the horse with Xue Jing, and he was in the spot. There was no one on the most prosperous streets of this Ice and Snow City. Xue Jing smiled and said, for today's competition, my father specially invited the city lord and a few people with identities to serve as the review committee, Dacheng and Qingfeng. The street has sent officers and soldiers to block them.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's shocked thought. It doesn’t take such a big shot. Qingfeng and Dacheng should have a lot of business in one day. If you stop working for such a simple exchange, how can you not be afraid of losing?\n\n\n\nYou don't understand this. Whether we are successful or successful, we will immediately suppress the other party and become the number one hotel in the entire Snow City. What is the profit that this honor can bring is also comparable to the business amount of a day?Dacheng Cheng had waited for this opportunity. Their boss once asked his father many times that he wanted to conduct such a competition, but his father refused. The chef of Dacheng Cheng Cheng was still young. Uncle Ming once said that he would have passed by himself within three years. Therefore, his father had never fought in order to protect the reputation of Qingwang. This is also the reason why Qingwang was finally suppressed by Dacheng. Today, when we are proud, Nian Bing, you have to work hard! !\n\n\n\nI chanted Bing and said, \"I'll do as much as I can. I know that this free wind is not that easy to pick up. Okay, let's go in.\"\n\n\n\nAs soon as he walked into Qingfeng, Nian Bing immediately felt a solemn atmosphere. There were not only Qingfeng servants on both sides of the passage, but also some strangers dressed in ordinary clothes. These people were inconspicuous when they saw them, but the mental power of the public-private joint venture Nian Bing was clear. These people were not as ordinary as they appeared on the surface. They were all masters who were good at martial arts.\n\n\n\nThe Qingfeng Hall was originally like this, but the nearly a hundred tables in the hall had been empty. There was a row of long tables in the center of the front. The chairs behind the table were empty. There were a pile of tools for kitchens on both sides of the hall. There were only some ordinary tools on the left and the one on the right, which were arranged by some people.\n\n\n\nXue Jing said in a low voice, you see, the front is the seat of the reviewer, the left is the place where you operate, and the right is the place where the chef of Dacheng Zheng operates. They have already started to arrange it. If you have any requests, please come up quickly and I will ask someone to do it immediately. Otherwise, it will be too late. You don’t have to worry about all kinds of materials. As long as you can name them, I can almost find them.\n\n\n\nI chanted Bing a little and leaned against Xue Jing's ears and said softly. Xue Jing's face kept showing surprise. These things were all very ordinary things.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"The ordinary Chinese beauty is the real ability, please arrange it as I say.\" Don't worry, I'm responsible.\n\n\n\nXue Jing clicked and said, \"You go and change your clothes. The clothes are placed on my bed in my room. I prepared them for you. After changing the clothes, just wait for the competition to begin.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing glanced at Xue Meng and said, \"I'm entering your room again.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing smiled and said, \"You can't be afraid, I want to give you something, go quickly.\" After saying that, it was like a red cloud.\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at Xue Jing's calmness and knew that the grudge between her and her had disappeared, but the disappearance of this grudge did not seem to be very wonderful. As he thought about it, he came to the back hall and drove to the snowy room. The door was not locked, and the familiar fragrance appeared at his nose again. When he walked to the bed, Nian Bing couldn't help but remember the embarrassment he had hidden here in order to hide from the snow last time.\n\n\n\nA snow-white dress was neatly placed on the top of the bed. When Nian Bingzhan opened the clothes, he couldn't help but be surprised. What kind of chef's clothes are there?It is clearly a Chinese suit. The white long robe is made of silver-shaped patterns. There are not many thorns, but they play the role of a dragon-shaped eye-catching dragon, making the whole set of clothes elegant in the Chinese style. The belt with the waist is simple, and it is also white. There is a slightly wide silver money on each side. In the center of the belt, there is a milky white jade tiles. Although it is not white jade with mutton fat, the touch is warm and it shows its extraordinary point. The chef obviously wears such clothes that only nobles can wear. Although he thought so, he still took off his magic robe and put this silver-white long robe on his body.",

    "content": "The clothes fit him perfectly, as if they were tailor-made for him. The fabric was very light and soft, and comfortable to wear.\n\n\"Nian, are you ready yet?\" Xue Jing's voice carried over, followed by the sound of footsteps. A figure in red appeared at the doorway. When Xue Jing saw Nian Bing in his new clothes, her eyes couldn't help but flash with a crimson brilliance. \"So handsome! I told you this outfit would look great on you. It's really, truly, fantastic!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled wryly. \"Jing'er, these clothes are nice, but they don't seem like something a chef should wear. You're really going to have me compete in this?\"\n\nThe two of them returned to the main hall of Pure Wind Study. The preparations were nearly complete. When Ming Yuan and Xue Ji saw Nian Bing emerge, they immediately came forward to greet him. Xue Ji's eyes lit up. \"Nian Bing,\" he said, \"if I were thirty or forty years younger, I'd probably be jealous of you. Truly a fine and talented-looking man.\"\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile. \"Sir, you flatter me. I'm a chef. Dressing like this doesn't seem appropriate for cooking, does it?\"\n\nXue Ji laughed heartily. \"It's fine, it's fine. I think it looks great. This time, I'm going to make Jin Hao of Great Achievement Pavilion admit complete defeat. Huh? His Lordship the Marquis has arrived.\"\n\nEveryone's gaze turned to the entrance, where two men were walking in. The strangers Nian Bing had seen earlier all bowed to them in unison. The two men were dressed in lavish clothes. Nian Bing recognized the man on the left: it was Luo Rou's father, the official in charge of Ice Snow City's finances, Earl Luo Hao. He deliberately walked half a step behind the man on his right, a faint smile on his chubby face. The man on the right was tall and imposing, with a dignified appearance, looking to be in his forties. Although he was only wearing ordinary fine clothes, the natural air of authority he exuded revealed his extraordinary status.\n\nXue Ji and Ming Yuan hurried to welcome them. \"Your Excellency, your presence at Pure Wind Study truly makes my humble establishment shine.\"\n\nThe Marquis smiled slightly. \"Brother Xue, we're all familiar with each other, no need for such formalities. I've been waiting for this competition for a long time. It seems Chef Ming has some new creations for us.\"\n\nXue Ji gave a mysterious smile and said, \"Your Excellency knows I never fight a battle I'm not sure of winning. Since I dared to issue the challenge, I naturally have some confidence. Allow me to introduce a young talent to you. Nian Bing, come. This is the lord of our Ice Snow City, Marquis Noah. Although the Marquis has a military background, he is also a gourmet. Today, he will serve as the head judge.\"\n\nNian Bing took a few steps forward, bowed slightly, and said respectfully to Noah, \"The commoner Nian Bing greets Your Excellency, the Marquis.\"\n\nLooking at the exceptionally handsome and dashing Nian Bing, a trace of surprise appeared in Noah's eyes. \"Brother Xue, which family's young master is this? What a handsome young man.\"\n\nXue Ji smiled. \"Your Excellency, please allow me to keep you in suspense for a little while. You will find out shortly. My lord, please, take the seat of honor inside.\"\n\nAlthough the Marquis was somewhat puzzled, Xue Ji's status was not as simple as that of a mere restaurant owner. He could offend anyone, but he would never offend Xue Ji. The power behind Xue Ji was something that even he, a marquis, absolutely could not afford to provoke. To be precise, aside from the imperial royal family, there were probably very few people who could afford to. Led by Xue Ji, Marquis Noah and Earl Luo Hao took the main seats behind the long table. Xue Ji sat beside them and said to Luo Hao, \"My Lord Earl, why didn't Rou'er accompany you today?\"\n\nLuo Hao chuckled. \"I can't control that girl. However, she would never miss an event like this. When I left, she said she was going to change her clothes. She should be here in a little while.\"\n\nJust then, two more people walked in from outside. These two were even more familiar to Nian Bing; it was Long Zhi and his daughter. Nian Bing hurried over to greet them. \"President, you came too?\"\n\nLong Zhi smiled. \"Besides magic, my only other hobby is eating. I'm a regular at Pure Wind Study. For today's competition, even if I weren't giving face to Brother Xue, I would have to come to support you. I'm also eager to taste what kind of delicious food a super-chef so highly praised by both Brother Xue and Ming Yuan can make. I only got the news when you were leaving, so I was a bit slower than you.\"\n\nLong Ling was still wearing her pale blue mage's robe. Looking at Nian Bing's attire, a trace of sorrow flashed in her beautiful eyes. A pang of pain shot through Nian Bing's heart. He almost lost control and went to ask her what was wrong, but he held back. His mother's despairing gaze echoed in his mind. In order to become stronger, he absolutely could not allow himself to get involved in matters of love.\n\nXue Ji came out again and greeted Long Zhi, \"You're just in time. The Marquis and the Earl have also just arrived. Come, Judge Long, you should take your seat as well.\"\n\nOnly then did Nian Bing realize that Long Zhi was also a judge. Indeed, with his status as the President of the Magicians' Guild, he was more than qualified. By inviting three such distinguished judges, Xue Ji was truly going all in, placing all his hopes on him. It seemed today's competition was a must-win. It would also be a way to repay Xue Ji for the Aotian Blade...\n\nXue Jing pulled Long Ling aside and began whispering to her. Nian Bing didn't know what he should be doing now, but Ming Yuan walked over to his side and said in a low voice, \"Nian Bing, what dishes will you be making later?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Master Ming, are there any rules or requirements for this kind of competition? This is my first time.\"\n\nMing Yuan said, \"...The requirements are quite simple. Within one hour, both sides must create three of their proudest dishes. That's all. Then the judges will decide the winner. Great Achievement Pavilion has a powerful backer. Their owner, Jin Hao, is the brother-in-law of His Majesty, the King of the Ice Moon Empire. His sister is the King's most favored concubine. Because of this connection, unless there's a huge difference in the taste of the dishes, the final result will still be a draw. Do you understand what I mean?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"I understand. It's to balance the relationship between Great Achievement Pavilion and Pure Wind Study. The Marquis won't easily declare a winner. But don't worry, I will make them accept their defeat wholeheartedly. Three dishes... I think I already know what I'm going to make.\"\n\nMing Yuan smiled. \"It's good that you're confident. Today, I will be your assistant.\" An assistant, in this context, is the one who handles the prep work and other lower-level tasks.\n\nNian Bing was startled and quickly said, \"How could I let that happen? How can I let you be my subordinate? In fact, I believe you could win with your own skills.\"\n\nMing Yuan shook his head. \"Although I'm a proud person, I also know my own limits. That last draw was already a stretch. The head chef of Great Achievement Pavilion is named Liao Feng, known as the 'Golden Chef'. The dishes he makes are the epitome of magnificence. He is one of the most promising chefs I have ever seen. After these past few years of training, his skill level is surely above mine. If I were to face him, I wouldn't even have a chance of securing a tie. If that weren't the case, why would the proprietor have kept putting off this challenge? This time, it's all up to you. I also want to witness more of the legendary skills passed down by the Ghost Chef.\"\n\nNian Bing wanted to say more, but Ming Yuan stopped him. He smiled. \"No need to refuse. To be the prep cook for the successor of the Ghost Chef is an honor in itself. Our opponents are here.\"\n\nFollowing Ming Yuan's gaze, he saw a group of people enter from the outer corridor. Of the two men at the front, the one on the left was tall and dressed in a magnificent golden robe. He was about fifty years old, with small but sharp, glittering eyes. Walking alongside him was a young man in a snow-white chef's uniform and a tall hat, about the same age as Shi Jiu. Although not as handsome as Nian Bing, he could still be considered good-looking. Unfortunately, his handsome face was marred by a touch of arrogance, giving off an air of conceit. Following them were two managers from Great Achievement Pavilion and three other chefs in uniform, who were clearly assistants for the head chef.\n\nEven without Ming Yuan's introduction, Nian Bing could guess that the man in the golden robe was the owner of Great Achievement Pavilion, Jin Hao, and the one beside him was its head chef, the 'Golden Chef' Liao Feng.\n\nJin Hao led his entourage to the judges' table and bowed respectfully. \"Jin Hao, leading the chefs of Great Achievement Pavilion, greets Your Excellencies, the Marquis and the Earl.\" Although he was a relative of the royal family, he held no official rank, so the proper etiquette was still required.\n\nMarquis Noah and Earl Luo Hao both stood up. Noah smiled. \"Brother Jin, no need to be so formal. Come, have a seat. Today, we will all enjoy a battle between a dragon and a tiger.\"\n\nJin Hao acknowledged and also moved behind the judges' table. Liao Feng, who had been beside him, turned to look at Ming Yuan, his eyes filled with a provocative light. \"A battle between a dragon and a tiger? I doubt that.\"\n\nJin Hao reprimanded him, \"Liao Feng, be respectful. Go and prepare.\" Liao Feng complied, bowed to the judges, and then walked to his side's kitchen station. Jin Hao's gaze turned to Xue Ji. He smiled slightly. \"Brother Xue, is Master Ming finally feeling better today? We've delayed this competition for over a year, haven't we? It seems you have some confidence.\"\n\nXue Ji smiled back. \"Brother Jin is too kind. Master Ming's health has indeed improved a lot. However, he is still slightly unwell, so his performance might be a bit lacking.\"\n\nJin Hao let out a loud laugh. \"It's fine, it's fine. Since Master Ming is ill, even if he loses, there's a valid excuse. We are, after all, mainly here for a friendly exchange of skills.\" Though his words sounded pleasant, anyone could hear the sarcasm within them.\n\nXue Ji smiled calmly. \"Lose? I'll have to ask Brother Jin to teach me how to write that word. As a simple warrior, my literary skills are indeed rather poor.\"\n\nJin Hao snorted coldly. \"Fine. Then today I will teach you how to write the word 'lose'. However, since Brother Xue insisted on this match, shouldn't we put a little something at stake? So the two master chefs don't work for nothing.\" Xue Ji said with complete confidence, \"Then what would Brother Jin like to wager?\"\n\nJin Hao glanced at Liao Feng, who was busy with preparations. \"It's nothing much, but I recently acquired a treasure. I'd like to bet it against this Pure Wind Study of yours, Brother Xue. Our Great Achievement Pavilion has plenty of splendor but lacks elegance. If our two restaurants could merge, it would be a wonderful thing. Don't you agree, Brother Xue?\"\n\nHearing that Jin Hao wanted to wager for Pure Wind Study, Long Zhi, Noah, and Luo Hao were all shocked. Pure Wind Study was Xue Ji's lifeblood. If Xue Ji lost, it would mean he could no longer stay in Ice Snow City. Such a stake was truly enormous. Just when they thought Xue Ji would not agree, he did. \"That sounds good. But it depends on what Brother Jin is willing to bet. I've poured half my life's blood into this Pure Wind Study. I won't gamble it for anything less than equal value. In my eyes, even your Great Achievement Pavilion isn't qualified.\"\n\nHearing this counter, Jin Hao smiled coldly. \"Great Achievement Pavilion isn't qualified? Then please have a look at this, Brother Xue, and see if it is.\" As he spoke, he reached into his robe and took out a small, square box. The box was black. Upon seeing it, Xue Ji's expression couldn't help but change slightly, because he recognized it. This box was also made of lead. Using lead to make a box was undoubtedly to conceal the light or energy of the item within. As the former owner of the Aotian Blade, he understood this all too well.\n\nA smug smile appeared in Jin Hao's eyes as he slowly opened the box. Instantly, a brilliant light shot towards the ceiling... A golden light filled the entire hall. It was a pure gold, radiating a gentle aura that made one instinctively feel a sense of warmth. Inside the box was a golden gemstone. Though its light was dazzling, it was not blinding. Everyone could clearly see a perfectly round bead, a flawless sphere. The bead itself was transparent, but it radiated a golden light, each ray appearing incredibly soft. As the golden light shone, it made people feel as if they were basking in a spring breeze. The gentle golden light retracted, and rings of golden halo slowly radiated outwards from the bead itself. Just from this strange phenomenon, it was not difficult to see the preciousness of this bead.\n\nThe others might have only been captivated by the gem's appearance, but Nian Bing, Long Zhi, and Long Ling certainly were not. Because they were magicians, and the strength of the magical element radiating from this gem was in no way inferior to the Wind Chant Stone. It represented the power of light, an extremely rare and surging light element. Aside from the aura of darkness, any other magical element would feel a sense of affinity when encountering light magic...",

    "content": "Although this gem and Fengyinshi are of the same level to a certain extent, due to the rarest of the shiny magicians, this bead is slightly worse than Fengyinshi in terms of application, and few people can completely remove the magical elements in such gems. Of course, this does not mean that it is less precious. The bright breath can not only help people calm their minds, but also eliminate all evil breaths. Even if ordinary people wear it on their body, they can strengthen their resistance and calm their minds.\n\n\n\n\"This bead was purchased from a down-and-out businessman. The bead is called the Holy Ray, and it is a congenital light mat stone. I have found someone to experience it. This bead is not any mine, but is completely condensed from light elements. But it is so thick that it is probably difficult to find the second one in the whole world. Originally, I wanted to give it to His Majesty the King of the Kingdom. However, since Brother Xue said that my great success is not as good as the clear wind, I can only bring it out. I wonder if Brother Xue thinks, can my Holy Ray Ray Ray Pearl bead be with you?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jin looked at Nian Bing, and at this time he couldn't help but feel a little hesitant. After all, clear wind was his half-life effort. If it was lost, how could he gain a foothold in Ice and Snow City in the future?\n\n\n\nAt this time, Nian Bing was thinking of several magical auras based on light-based magic. Light-based magic is an indispensable medium for some complex and powerful magical auras, and he does not have the ability to prepare light-based magic. If he could obtain this sacred magic, it would be extremely beneficial for the research on magical auras. He could even use the breath of this bead to create a dish with bright breath. Seeing Xue Ni's eyes, he strode to the review board, first gave Xue Ni a confident look, and then placed the box with the Aotian knife in his hand on the table of the review board. \n\n\n\n\"Boss Jin, your brother's sacred pearls are indeed precious, but if you use them to sacrifice, it will hurt the harmony of the two families. Why not just use the things in this box to sacrifice pearls to sacred pearls when I come and use the things in this box to sacred pearls.\"\n\n\n\nJin Hao snorted coldly. He had already noticed that Nian Bing, an outsider, had already surprised him a lot before. However, as his status as a royal family, he naturally would not take Nian Bing seriously and snorted coldly. He said, \"What are you? What qualifications do you have to be able to compete with me? Is there anything in your box that is comparable to the Santa Crown Pearl?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing did not get angry about Jin Haodi's contempt. She smiled indifferently and said, \"Is it worth a prize? I also asked Boss Jin to read something and say, as for me, I am a part of Qingfeng.\"\n\n\n\nXue Feng felt a little relaxed in his heart. Although Aotian beat him very precious, he had already given Nian Bing, and nothing else. The Aotian sword was far away in his heart and could not compare with Qingfeng. \"It's good, Nian Bing can represent me. The items in this box are of no value below Brother Jin's sacred pearl.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing opened the long box, and the same situation as yesterday appeared. Green light rose into the sky, and instantly forced the golden light from the hall to retreat.The two treasure lights of Jin and Qing were not rejected in the hall. They each occupied a position, and the light was constantly shining. Nian Bing reached into the box, took out the Aotian sword, and pointed the handle towards several reviewers, and said calmly: \"This knife is called Aotian, it is owned by Uncle Xue. The singing stone embedded on the handle is no less than that of the Saint-Yao. The blade is even more decorated with lapis lazuli. It should be enough to compare with the Saint-Yao pearl.\"\n\n\n\nThe greedy light flashed through Jin Hao's eyes. What was he going to say when an anxious voice suddenly came, \"Lao Jin, I want this knife, it's such a knife!\"\n\n\n\nWith the sound of the sound, Liao Feng strode to the meeting of the review committee, staring at Aotian in Nian Bing's hand with a greedy gaze, \"It's easy to fight, it's such a good knife. Lao Jin, I must have this knife and catch him.\"\n\n\n\nJin Hao originally wanted to use the Holy Yaozhu to gain more benefits, but after being beaten by Liao Feng, it was hard to talk to the society anymore. He put the box monk with the Holy Yaozhu in it and said, \"Okay, let's take a look here and ask the Marquis and Earl to testify.\" As he said, he pushed the box in his hand to the Marquis.\n\n\n\nAs a marquis, Noah has seen many treasures in his life, but he has never been able to compare with these two things in front of him. He endured the pain in his heart, and said, \"Okay, I will be a witness for you to see this occasion. That's how good it is. The things you want to be a big deal are much stronger than the money you have. It won't hurt your temper. Then let the competition start now, the old rules, the time is half a day.\"\n\n\n\nLiao Feng's eyes were full of confidence, and Ling Feng's eyes shot towards Ming far away. Ming Yuan's face showed a strange smile, \"Liao Feng, it is a good thing for young people to have the ability, but it's too ugly to fall and fall very much. You don't need to look at me. I'm not the protagonist today, and the person who competes with you is right next to you.\"\n\n\n\nLiao Feng and Jin Hao were shocked at the same time. The eyes of the two fell on Nian Bing. Liao Feng looked up and down at Nian Bing, who looked like a noble clan, and said in confusion: \"He? Can he be a chef like this?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jin smiled and said, \"Why can't it be? Nian Bing is my newly hired chef, the same as the Ming brothers. Today, he will represent Qingfeng to participate in the competition. The challenge I set was not said to be Liao Feng in the Mingyuan challenge, but Qingfeng to become a great success. Nian Bing is a part of my Qingfeng, so he naturally has the qualifications to participate.\"\n\n\n\nOn the review meeting, Hou Jue and the Earl both showed shocking gazes in their eyes. Marquis Noah was better. He had never seen Nian Bing. Earl Luo Hao once saw him wearing a fire magic robe at his daughter's banquet. The first dance on his daughter's birthday was also the only one, which was dancing with this young man. With Nian Bing's appearance, he naturally left a deep impression on him. He turned his head to Long Zhi who was beside him and asked, \"Children, isn't this young man named Nian Bing from your association? Why did he run to Qingfeng again and become a chef?\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi smiled bitterly and said, \"I don't want to let him come either, but Brother Xuexi's condition is so good! The Aotian beat in Nian Bing's hand is the value of him being a chef.\"\n\n\n\nThe light in Jin Hao's eyes was flashing, and all the original nonsense was broken. He never expected that Xue Xiao would ask another chef to fight against Liao Feng. From Xue Xiao's confident gaze, he understood that this young man must have extraordinary charm in the art. \"Marquis, it's probably inappropriate to change people with a clear wind.\"\n\n\n\nNoya was looking at Nian Bing in surprise at this time, and smiled and said, \"There is nothing wrong. Brother Xue said that this time is a competition between Qingfeng and Dachengzi. I also want to see what special things are there in such a young man on the kitchen art. Don't be in a vague time. The competition will begin now.\"\n\n\n\nAt this moment, everyone's eyes suddenly lit up, at the door. Di Luorou appeared in a long blue dress. The skirt she wore today looked very simple and had no decorations. The blue length was combed neatly with a blue strap behind her back. As soon as she entered the door, she attracted everyone's attention. Liao Feng beside Nian Bing's side was also intoxicated. \n\n\n\nLuo Rou walked to the meeting and said in a ceremony: \"Uncle Noah, dad, Uncle Xue, Uncle Jin, Rou is late. Please give me some advice.\"\n\n\n\nSeeing that the daughter of wisdom in the whole city was famous, whether it was Jin Hao or Xue Yan, the expression on her face was calm. Luo Rou used her wisdom to win their respect in the Ice and Snow City. Although she is just a female sect in the world and is not a fight at all, she is no less respected than his father. Noah laughed and said, \"I knew you were indispensable in this kind of enthusiasm. Come and sit next to your father and wait and see the show. Today's competition must be very exciting. Qingfeng specially invited a new chef.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou looked at Nian Bing, with a glittering light in her eyes, and smiled and said, \"The niece has seen his art, which is indeed unforgettable. I also want to see who he and Mr. Liao can win the competition.\" Her words were very plain and did not praise Nian Bing, but a simple sentence had already brought Nian Bing to the same status as Liao Feng.\n\n\n\nLiao Feng smiled and said, \"Miss Wisdom hasn't been to our great success for a long time. When will you come to visit me when you have time? Liao Feng will definitely go to the kitchen and make it a special place for the lady to eat alone.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou smiled lightly and said, \"That's good! However, if Luo Ruo occupied the famous Liao Ke, there would probably be many diners asking me for trouble.\" She deliberately made a look of fear, which made everyone laugh. Liao Feng hurriedly said, \"No, no, what is my reputation? It's far worse than the wise lady. It's just a little bigger than the Qingfeng.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked around with a cold eyes. Although he had never seen Liao Feng's cooking art before, he had shown his talent when facing Luo Rou. Nian Bing understood that Liao Feng was not as good as Mingyuan in his understanding of cooking art. The reason why he achieved today was probably just to rely on his talent. After looking at him for a while, Nian Bing walked towards the chef who belonged to her.Xue Jing suddenly ran out from the side, came to Nian Bing, and said, \"Low, why are you so arrogant as long as you are?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment, but he still did it, \"It seems that you are not short either! I am just a little taller than you.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing smiled slightly, took out a snow-white chef hat from behind, tied the golden length of Nianbing with his hands, and put the chef hat on his head, \"Well, this is like a chef.\"\n\n\n\nSeeing Xue Jing and Nian Bing's secret look, Long Ling lowered his head sadly, and there was a strange light in Luo Rou's eyes.\n\n\n\nUnder the order of the Marquis of Noah, Liao Feng also returned to his own cafe and ordered his three subordinates in a low voice to start the action. Nian Bing stood behind her own coffee shop and did not rush to take action, but observed his opponent. He was surprised that he had actually underestimated Liao Feng. After standing in the kitchen, Liao Feng was familiar with dancing the shiny kitchen knife in his hand, with a very special look. Various materials changed constantly in his hands, and could instantly concentrate on the kitchen. He was indeed not a simple character.\n\n\n\nMing Yuan said softly in Nian Bing's ears, \"What are we doing? I saw that the ingredients you let Jingyun take are all very ordinary things. What method do you plan to cook them?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Today, I will destroy Huali with Huali. I will suppress this golden chef Liao Feng in either way, so I will not rush to do anything.\"\n\n\n\nThe one who has the most confidence in Nian Bing is not Xue Yan, but Ming Yuan. As a chef, he knew very well that he and Nian Bing were not in the same realm at all. Even if Nian Bing made the Nine Green Dragon Ice Cloud again, it would be enough to win. In addition, Nian Bing had obtained the Aotian Sword, there was no thought at all in this competition. \n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at the Aotian sword in his hand with a low head. The green light flowed on the blade, feeling the air flow and lively wind elements wrapped around his hands. Nian Bing suddenly felt that the magic power of the same origin of ice and fire in his body seemed to be clamoring Aotian. The wind elements that should have been unused, under the call of the same origin of ice and fire, actually had a close feeling with him. It was a wonderful feeling and a comfortable feeling. Nian Bing's mind was completely integrated with the sword. He was fascinated by this state and seemed to have forgotten the time.\n\n\n\nOn the board of the evaluation committee, Marquis Noya asked Xueqi beside him: \"Brother Xue, why is the newly hired chef just watching the knife there and not moving? Look, Liao Feng is so hot that he is not long for half a time. If he has not completed the competition because of his slow move, I can only sentence you to clear the wind.\"\n\n\n\nXue Feng had a slight brow, and he was worried about the same problem. If Nian Binglian's competition was not completed, then no one could help Qingfeng. Just as he was about to remind Nian Bing, Luo Rou, the wise girl beside Luo Hao, said, \"Don't worry about him, he often does unexpected and strange things. Since he has not yet taken action, he is naturally sure. Let him continue to watch.At this time, he had already started cooking the first dish. The flames passed through the sky. Liao Feng was free and sensual. Various cookware flipped up and down in his hands. The fragrance of his nose was spread out. Jingwei's dishes kept stir-frying them in the pot. His movements were fancy, but they were very reasonable. No action contained a mysterious machine. The three chefs who helped him provide various ingredients in small quantities.\n\n\n\nHalf of the competition has passed, Liao Feng has begun to cook his last dish, and Nian Bing is still standing there looking at his knife. He is not moving, Ming Yuan beside him is standing there. At this time, he is very excited. He is waiting, waiting to see the demon chef show his own ultimate. They were not in a hurry, Xue was so anxious that the competition time was half way through, and Nian Bing still fought every time, and this competition was related to Qingfeng's reputation and Aotian Dao's achievement! Jin Hao, who was standing by, was sneering in his heart at this time. He wished Nian Bing would keep this state until the end. As long as he won Qingfeng this time, he would not only get the knife, but also, Qingfeng would never be able to lift his head in front of Dacheng.",

    "content": "Just as everyone was lost in their own thoughts, Nian Bing’s gaze finally lifted from his knife. He slowly raised his head, looked at the busy Liao Feng opposite him, and said calmly, “Master Ming, in a moment, please throw the various ingredients to me as I need them. Aim for my chest. Thank you. Oh, great Goddess of Ice and Snow! Please lend me your fury and deliver us to the lost shore—Blizzard.”\n\nWith Nian Bing’s incantation, the temperature in the entire hall suddenly dropped. Flakes of snow began to appear in mid-air. Strangely, the snow did not interfere with Liao Feng on the other side, appearing only around Nian Bing. Pale blue snowflakes lifted Nian Bing’s body, and he floated up and out from behind his cooking station. Before the astonished eyes of the crowd, he slowly came to the center of the hall. Liao Feng, seeing the strange phenomenon on Nian Bing’s side, faltered for a moment, almost making a mistake. He hurriedly collected himself and continued preparing his own dishes. Under Nian Bing’s powerful magical control, the blizzard gathered at his feet, forming a vortex of wind and snow. Nian Bing was surprised to discover that the Aotian Knife in his hand was constantly emitting an aura of wind, causing the blizzard at his feet to spin even faster. The hall of Clear Wind Hall was very high, nearly ten meters. Nian Bing floated about two meters off the ground and called out lightly, “Scallion.”\n\nA clean scallion was tossed from Ming Yuan’s hand, flying toward Nian Bing’s chest. A cyan light bloomed into countless afterimages, and the scallion vanished within them. “Ginger.”\n\nSimilarly, a piece of ginger flew into the cyan light and disappeared. Among those present, Marquis Noah and Xue Ji possessed the highest martial skill, but even they could only vaguely see that the scallion and ginger had been turned to powder, enveloped by the cyan blade-light, preventing them from falling. It was the first time any of them had witnessed such a method of cooking in mid-air. The magnificent scene immediately outshone Liao Feng.\n\n“A whole chicken.” A cleaned chicken flew towards Nian Bing. He caught a chicken foot with his left hand and tossed the bird into the air. At the same time, a ball of fire erupted from his left hand. Under his special magical control, the flame actually formed the shape of a disc. Nian Bing guided the Aotian Knife with his right hand, and an icicle shot out like lightning to wrap around the oil container on the station. With a flick of his wrist, a stream of glistening oil splashed out from the container. The fire disc in Nian Bing’s left hand caught the oil precisely, and the flames instantly flared up. The cyan light vanished, and the powdered scallion and ginger simultaneously fell into the flames. The whole chicken descended from the sky, landing directly in the flaming oil. In an instant, the aroma of scallion and ginger flash-frying in oil filled the hall.\n\nLong Zhi had already stood up, his eyes filled with shock and uncertainty as he stared at the flame in Nian Bing’s left hand. That was clearly fire magic! Although it was only the lowest-tier Flame Spell, it had been cast by an ice mage. What did this mean? Long Zhi couldn't begin to imagine. While he was lost in confusion, Nian Bing’s actions did not stop.\n\nA flash of cyan light, and the one-chi-seven-cun-long¹ Aotian Knife plunged directly into the falling chicken. Under Nian Bing’s skilled manipulation, it turned the chicken over and over. The aroma of the scallion and ginger, roasted by the flaming oil, was completely infused into the chicken. The flame in Nian Bing's hand began to change, pulsing with varying intensity. The flame, stretching from left to right, divided into nine different sizes to continue roasting the chicken. Carried by the blizzard, his body slowly moved towards the cooking station. Suddenly, the blizzard drifted away. Nian Bing landed in front of the station, quickly snatched two lotus leaves from the table, and wrapped the chicken. The lotus-leaf-wrapped chicken spun rapidly over the flame three times. Then, the fire in his hand vanished. A blue light shone, and a layer of ice about an inch thick formed around the lotus leaves. Switching between ice and fire, all of it happened so naturally. But everyone present understood that ice and fire were two extremes. For them to appear simultaneously in the hands of one mage—the implications were already beyond their imagination.\n\nLuo Rou finally understood. She understood why Liao San had been attacked by two types of magic, and she understood that there was, in fact, only one Magic Assassin.\n\nThe ice-encased chicken was placed on the cooking station. The blizzard once again enveloped Nian Bing’s body, and he floated off the ground. This time, Nian Bing’s speech was noticeably faster. “Scallion, ginger, garlic.” While calling for his ingredients, Nian Bing directed the blizzard to sweep precisely over the station. With a blast of wind and snow, the condiment containers were swept into the air. Under his powerful magical control, the containers floated before him. Nian Bing opened his left hand, and blue light condensed in his palm, quickly forming a huge ice ladle. The scallion, ginger, and garlic fell into it simultaneously. No, it could no longer be described as a ladle; it was a pot forged from ice. Nian Bing put the Aotian Knife in his mouth, waved his right hand, and conjured another ice ladle, this one much smaller. The small ladle dipped forward, picking out various spices and adding them to the ice pot. He clenched his right hand, and the ice ladle disappeared, replaced by a ball of fire. The fireball shot into the ice pot with a *bang*, and the spices inside instantly ignited. That was no ordinary Fireball spell, but an Explosive Flame! This time, Nian Bing hadn't cast it instantly—he didn't yet have the ability to instant-cast Explosive Flame—but had used a small scroll. With his strong magical control, the Explosive Flame skillfully burned the spices in the ice pot. The knife fell back into his right hand, and he shouted again, “Tomatoes, two.”\n\nMing Yuan flicked his wrist and threw two tomatoes to Nian Bing, watching his every move without blinking, afraid to miss a single detail.\n\nCyan light flashed, instantly enveloping the red tomatoes. Two red strips drifted out from the cyan light. The judges were shocked to see they were the tomato skins, perfectly intact with only a single slit. To peel a tomato with a knife like that—such knife skills left the judges gaping in astonishment. Red juice sprinkled from the air into the flaming ice pot. Under the work of the Aotian Knife, the tomatoes had been turned into juice. Infused with the seasonings, the tomato juice instantly merged into the flames. Nian Bing gave the ice pot a slight shake, tossing the contents into the air. Under the extreme heat of the Explosive Flame, the tomato juice had completely fused with the spices. The ice pot spun once in the air, catching the tomato-based sauce. “Lamb ribs.”\n\nHalf a rack of lamb ribs flew towards Nian Bing. The Aotian Knife flashed, and the ribs were evenly cut into small segments that fell into the ice pot. The raw lamb ribs touched the hot sauce, creating a piercing sizzle. With a flick of his wrist, Nian Bing let go of the ice pot, and it landed steadily on the cooking station. He pointed his left hand towards the pot, and the Flame Spell appeared again, reigniting the Explosive Flame that was about to go out. Nian Bing said calmly, “Master Ming. Please drizzle a small spoonful of clear oil onto the flames in the pot every three breaths.” The outside of the ice pot was constantly melting, while the inside was constantly burning. Through the translucent ice, one could clearly see the lamb ribs and tomato sauce tumbling within the Explosive Flame.\n\nNian Bing floated to the ground. The blizzard returned the condiment containers to the station. He brought his hands together, and the swirling blizzard began to condense. Gradually, it solidified into a round block of ice half a meter in diameter and about eight cun thick. Nian Bing stared intently at the ice block before him. Suddenly, the Aotian Knife traced a ring of cyan light, circling the block once to shave off all the uneven edges. The Aotian Knife, like a ball of cyan light, trembled in Nian Bing’s hand, a low moan emitting from its blade. The clear hum of the Wind of Freedom danced continuously around the ice block.\n\nThe cyan light subsided. Nian Bing returned behind the cooking station. The round block of ice had been neatly divided into eight perfectly connected, triangular sections of identical size. Nian Bing pressed his left hand on this eight-sectioned ice platter, and a cold aura immediately enveloped it, preventing it from melting. Nian Bing said in a focused voice, “Potato, carrot, cucumber, sweet potato, pork, mutton, beef, and dog meat, one piece of each.” These items were already prepared; the moment he spoke, Ming Yuan immediately placed them before him.\n\nAs Ming Yuan set out the ingredients, Nian Bing picked up a pot from the side and filled it with clear water. He pulled a scroll from his robes with his left hand, and fueled by his magic, an Explosive Flame appeared in his palm. The water in the pot boiled almost instantly. Nian Bing bit down on the pot handle, controlling the flame with his left hand while picking up the Aotian Knife with his right. He lifted two cleaned, snow-white fish from the side. This was the Extreme Ice Snow Fish, a specialty of the Ice Moon Empire, which lived only in the Icy Sea to the north. It had no scales, and its flesh was extremely delicious and nourishing. The Snow Fish was also the most precious ingredient Nian Bing was using today.\n\nA hazy cyan blade-light enveloped the fish. First, the Aotian Knife flicked at the head and tail of each fish in four smooth cuts. The heads and tails fell to the side, while the two fish bodies were lifted up. A crisp sound rang",

    "content": "The six dishes were served on the review seat, and Nian Bing's three dishes were covered with a faint white fog. The Marquis of Noya looked at Nian Bing, then looked at Liao Feng, who was contemplative, and smiled and said, \"Please introduce your dishes to each of you. Let's start to taste, Liao Feng, come first.\" The bowls and chopsticks were served, including Xue Yan and Jin Hao, and each of them picked up the chopsticks and prepared them. Their eyes were completely focused on Nian Bing's three dishes that used ice as a utensil.\n\n\n\nLiao Feng shook his head and looked at Nian Bing next to him, with a complex light in his eyes, \"I think I don't have to introduce anything anymore. I just want to taste this chef Nian Bing.\"\n\n\n\nMarquis Noya's eyes turned to Nian Bing and smiled and said, \"Then please introduce it to the chef Nian Bing.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at the dishes covered with ice fogs in front of him and said calmly, \"My three dishes belong to the Ice and Fire Fusion Series. I call this series the Ninth Heaven of Ice and Fire.\" As he said, Nian Bing pointed to the first dish and said, \"The main ingredient of this dish is an ordinary chicken, which I call ice and fire hot chicken, and the chicken itself is ordinary, but I chose to use flame to burst out the aroma of the ginger and ginger, so that it can be soaked in the chicken, and then baked with flames to allow the chicken to enter the 80% ripe state, extinguish the flame, wrap it with lotus leaves, and seal it with ice outside. Because the chicken body is hot, the lotus leaves will be better released under the action of two extreme temperatures of ice heat, and the fragrance in the lotus leaves will be completely integrated into the chicken. After that, the ice and lotus leaves will disappear, the fragrance spread out from the lotus leaves will be completely fried into the chicken, and the chicken will be cooked. At this time, the chicken will become smoother and softer under the influence of two extreme temperatures of ice and fire, and the skin will be golden and crispy. Maybe all the reviewers have already realized this dish. I have not used any flavor-enhancing ingredients, and It was not my mistake, but I did it on purpose, and the cooking lectures fully demonstrated the original flavor of the ingredients. This is the real way to cook. Therefore, the biggest feature of ice-fired and hot-boiled chicken is the word \"scent\", which is a different fragrance. As for sealing it with an ice cover outside, it is to keep the temperature and fragrance of ice-fired and hot-boiled chicken. Please take advantage of the hot-boiled chicken.\" \n\n\n\nThe hands of the people started to move at the same time. No one paid attention to the three dishes made by Liao Feng. Instead, they went straight to the hot and hot lotus chicken in Nianbing. The ice layer outside was pierced by chopsticks. At the same time, the rich fragrance came over the surface, and the surface of the chicken turned completely golden, and everyone was busy. The chicken skin is extremely crispy. Of course, after the first bite of chicken was put into the mouth, the reviewers, including Jin Hao, made the same move and continued to stretch out the second chopsticks. Liao Feng chewed the tender chicken meat on the side, and his expression changed constantly. He was not sad, but was surprised.\n\n\n\n\"Brother Nian, I am really convinced. Not only does your ice-fire and hot-boiled chicken completely reveal the taste of the chicken itself, but it also contains nine different aromas, some are thick and some are light. I calculated that there are eight kinds in total. Oh, no, it is nine kinds of flavors. No wonder it is called the Nine Heavens of Ice and Fire. Even if my three dishes are combined, they are not as good as your plate of chicken!\"\n\n\n\nFeeling that Liao Feng was proud and straightforward, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel more favorable to him.I just wanted to say something, and I heard the Marquis of Noah shouted, \"Lao Xue, take a fewer bites and leave me some, my chicken legs, and I...\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked down and felt cold in his heart. At this time, the chicken plate had no drops, and there was no residue left. All the reviewers seemed to have not eaten it, nor did they care about oil, and they had already started to use their hands directly. Luo Rou, who was full of money, was also eating with a chicken wing. When it comes to delicious food, there is no longer the word \"Shang Ya View\" that anyone still cares about.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"Eat slowly, aren't there two more dishes?\" He pointed to the plate of lamb chops and said, \"This dish with lamb chops as the main ingredient is called Ice and Fire Blood Rain Rain. I have added more than a dozen ingredients, each of which is only a few, not for the taste, but to set off the aroma of lamb chops. As we all know, lamb has a certain fishy smell, and tomato sauce is all about it. After the mixing of the ingredients, not only will it not remove the fishy smell, but it will play a role in setting off. Through two extreme magics of ice and fire, all the ingredients and the flavor of tomato juice are completely immersed in the lamb chops, making the lamb chops appear fishy and tasty. The tomato juice outside may have been refreshed, but the lamb chops inside are absolutely hot, cold on the outside and hot on the inside, not having a taste of it.\" \n\n\n\nAfter he finished speaking, the review committee chewed chicken in his mouth, and his hands were holding chopsticks to control the blood and rain of ice, fire and rain. The ice cover was extremely enthusiastic, and the comments on Nian Bing's food to his food were extremely pertinent. The review committee clearly found the correct answer from the lamb chops in every sentence he said. Luo Rou became smart this time. He immediately stretched his chopsticks to the third dish cooked with fish soup at the entrance.\n\n\n\n\"Wow, it's so delicious! Why doesn't the snow fish I ate before have this flavor?\" Luo Rou held a spoon in her hand and took a sip of the soup. She was fascinated by the dish served in the eight-point ice plate.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"This is my best choice in the Jiuchongtian cuisine of Ice and Fire, called Ice and Fire Eight Fruits. You should have seen it during the production process. I use snow fish as soup, and the fish bones are also chopped into powder. There are two errors in ordinary cooking snow fish. One is that it is impossible to remove snow fish. The other is to throw away the fish bones of snowfish. The first solution to the first problem is very simple, that is, cramps. Any fish has tendons. That is, when you see the white wire I pulled out, the tendons of fish are also called fishy tendons. As long as you remove it, the smell of earthy smell will naturally disappear. As for the snowfish Fish bones have a certain amount of fish oil in it, which is the most beautiful place. Therefore, putting a whole piece of snow fish into the soup is naturally the best choice. The main ingredients of this ice and fire eight oysters are nine, namely snow fish and eight other ordinary materials. When the snow fish soup is still burning, I poured it into the eight oysters ice plate. In this way, the other eight fine silk ingredients will be cooked by the snowfish soup without losing their own taste. When the temperature of the snowfish soup is lowered by the ice plate, the taste of the eight ingredients will be integrated into the snowfish soup. Therefore, the biggest feature of this ice-fired Eight-Fished Eight-Fished Eight-Fished Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-Sweetened Eight-SweetThis dish is actually a soup, and it's enough to drink it. The temperature of the soup should be just right now, please give it a try. \"\n\n\n\nWhether it is the service staff of Qingfeng, or the servants who wear plainclothes to protect the marquis and counts, they all understand what it is called wind and what it is called voracious swallowing. The three dishes made by Jin Che Liao Feng are also extremely Huali from the outside, but compared to Nian Bing's Ice and Fire Nine-Chengtian cuisine, they are far inferior to the Huali level. Especially the faint white fog of the Nine-Chief Tian Cuisine is enough to attract attention. After the explanation of the Bingdi, the three dishes he made have completely disappeared. The reviewers are all like not doing the same thing, just to eat the plates made of ice.\n\n\n\nJin Hao put down the tableware in his hand, looked at Nian Bing, and suddenly said, \"I have been living a long life in my life and have never eaten such delicious food. Nian Bing Keat. If you want me to come to us for a great success, I accept any conditions you have made.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said calmly: \"Did Boss Jin agree? Don't you need to judge the judging committee?\"\n\n\n\nJin Hao's eyes shone with light. \"No need, I'm familiar with what kind of dishes Liao Feng can make. I've gone, and I've gone very thoroughly. I really don't understand. Brother Xue found you from where I am. Jin Hao is not a person I can't afford, but if I go, I'm going to lose. I hope you will consider me. The Marquis and Earl, Jin Hao has something to do, so I will leave.\" After speaking, he walked out of the appraisal committee and left Qing Feng.\n\n\n\nThe chefs who originally helped Liao Feng followed him, Liao Feng asked Nian Bing, \"Brother Nian, can you tell me how you controlled the taste of chicken so much?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled indifferently and said, \"It's important to be the heat. Although the chicken needs to be cooked, the heat and the amount of fusion with the ginger can be controlled. The taste will naturally change. This may be the wonderful magic. I have also read the dishes you cooked. You pay too much attention to the appearance. Although it can be imagined that the taste is not bad, the appearance is still a little worse than that. If you can pay more attention to the changes in the taste in the future, you will definitely be able to make a step forward.\"\n\n\n\nLiao Feng's eyes showed respect, \"I've been taught. I will definitely teach again if I have the opportunity to teach again.\" After speaking, he turned around after celebrating to the count and the marquis.\n\n\n\nThe Marquis recovered his previous divine spirit, stood up, looked at Nian Bing, and showed a complimentary look, \"Nian Bing, you won the victory in this competition with your absolute advantage. However, I am very surprised, why can you possess two kinds of magic at the same time? Although I am not familiar with magic, I also know that this is abnormal.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing reached into his hand and took out a bunch of rolling axes from it, ranging from thirty to big or small, and smiled and said, \"Marquis, please see, in fact, I am just an ice-type magician, and all the flames are made with these things. I used the ice-type rolling axes I made to the magic store to change some fire-type rolling axes, and combined with my own cooking art, naturally I had that effect.\"\n\n\n\nWhen the Marquis saw such many magical axes, he couldn't help but feel a little uncomfortable. After all, even the poor axes have considerable value, especially those few high-level axes with very small sizes. You don't need to look at them, you can tell that Su Han's magical ability is quite good. It's worth the city, so I turned my head to look at Long Zhi, \"Chairman Long, you always ask for the above to pay. Now it seems that you have a lot of resources in the Magician Association!\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi saw Nian Bing and said, \"Don't make mistakes in the size of the Marquis. These ripples are owned by Nian Bing himself. He is very talented in making magic ripples and has a high success rate, so there are so many, which are not provided by the trade association.\"\n\n\n\nThe Marquis laughed and said, \"No matter what, I am so impressed by the exquisiteness of Nian Bing's art. I am afraid that the imperial chefs in His Majesty the Palace of the Kingdom cannot be compared. They are the Nine Heavens of Ice and Fire, and the One! It is really a fresh topic to use magic to cook. It seems that I will give advice to those art schools.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou stood up and smiled and said, \"Uncle Noya, it's useless for you to give me advice. How many magicians are willing to learn about the art of cooking? Uncle, since Nian Bing has won, shouldn't the contracted spoils be given to him?\"\n\n\n\nThe Marquis of Noah's face was red, and the box with the saint stone was always right next to him. He was actually a little embarrassed to give up this precious light stone, but after he was in his status, it was not easy to show his true nature at this time. He pointed at the head and said, \"Yes, I almost forgot. I missed Bing, and gave it to you. This is your spoil.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing took the box made by herself and sent it to Xue Yan beside her, \"Uncle, this is your favor.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jin didn't answer and smiled and said, \"No, this is what you won. You used the Aotian knife to make a bid. Although Aotian is not entirely your thing now, at least I have sold it. Why give it to me if you win by yourself?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment, looked at the deep gaze in Xue Yan's eyes, tightened the square box in his hand, and smiled and said, \"Then I'm so disrespectful.\" He didn't want to ask Xue for another opportunity to make a request, and he openly put the Saint-Yang Pearl into his mind. Although this is a bit worse in the number of gifts, Nian Bing is now incredible for a treasure of the level of San Yaozhu.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi walked out from behind the board of the evaluation committee and said to the Marquis and Earl: \"Everyone, today's competition is over. Brother Xue, if you have nothing to do, let Nianbing go back with us.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jin has always had a good relationship with Long Zhi, and why did Nian Bing’s great success today make him feel good, \"Okay, then you go back. Nian Bing, I will send a horse to pick you up tomorrow evening.\"\n\n\n\nMarquis Noya said a little dissatisfied: \"I haven't eaten those three dishes yet. I'm so begging for you to make two more dishes for us.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing felt dissatisfied. As a top-level chef, he did not work hard to learn how to serve these senior officials.But the city lord who refused to be Snow City at this time was a little bit unspeakable. In the face of difficulty, Luo Rou attacked him again. \"Uncle Noya, the delicious food is not used too much. No matter how delicious food is eaten, the manufacturer cannot get the real taste. Nian Bing has just used so much magic, so let him go back and rest. Isn't it the same for you to come again tomorrow?\"\n\n\n\nMarquis Noya heard Luo Rou's words and was surprised to be no longer silenced. He pointed at the tip and said, \"Since Rou said that, then that's what it is today, Lao Xue! Take out your treasured wine and drink a few glasses. This is definitely OK. Nian Bing, you go back first, and I will definitely come and taste your handicraft tomorrow. The Nine Heavens of Ice and Fire series is indeed creative.\"",

    "content": "Great success. Jin Hao sat on a carved wooden chair with a serious expression, with the eldest shopkeeper, the second shopkeeper and Liao Feng standing in front of him.\n\n\n\n   After slamming the table, Jin Hao said angrily: “You are talking! Why do you all look like a fool!”\n\n\n\nThe short and fat shopkeeper said with a bitter face: \"Master East, what can we do? You have also seen that the boy named Nian Bing has indeed reached the level of magical skills in the art. It may be difficult to reduce the risk in this regard.\"\n\n\n\nJin Hao snorted coldly, \"How could you let me wait? Today, the entire street was blocked. It has been known to the whole city. If there is no good way to deal with it, our Dachengjia business will definitely plummet. Can you let me think of that old man Xueqian? When I think of his proud look, I want to kill him.\"\n\n\n\nThe second shopkeeper suddenly smiled, stepped forward, and said, \"Lord Dong, this is not a solution.\"\n\n\n\nJin Hao's eyes lit up and he said, \"What's the solution? Let's say it quickly.\"\n\n\n\nThe second shopkeeper turned his eyes and said, \"There are two ways to do it now. When I was thinking about Bingboy doing it, I had carefully observed him. His figure made me feel very familiar. It was almost the same as the person who killed the third brother at the beginning. Moreover, the injury on the third brother also included two magics, ice and fire. He also showed two kinds of magic today. Although the magic level is not high, his magic control may not be able to reach the level of the killing.\"\n\n\n\nJin Hao said, \"Do you suspect that he is his devil? Are you sure?\"\n\n\n\nThe second shopkeeper snatched his head and said, \"To be honest, I'm not sure. Because when I fought with the devil that day, he mainly used fire magic, and today I used ice magic when cooking. Those fire magic seem to be done with rolling shafts, so I can't be sure that he was the devil who was the devil at the beginning. However, despite this, we can also conduct an investigation. Once it is confirmed that he is that person, then he is likely to be the Ice Goddess of the Ice and Snow Goddess's sacrificial god. At that time, we only need to secretly report to the goddess sacrifice master. Not only will Nian Bing be unlucky, but even Qingfeng will inevitably be affected. Even if the blood-devouring soul is strong, I will never dare to be enemies with the goddess sacrifice master. Xuexian's doomsday is coming. Of course, this method has certain risks. First, we may not be able to find out the results. Another thing, even if Nian Bing is a demon killer, it is not the one who the goddess sacrifice master is looking for, I am afraid that the goddess sacrifice master will be angry.\"\n\n\n\nJin Hao clicked the head and said, \"Speak another way.\"\n\n\n\nThe second shopkeeper smiled and said, \"The other method is much more grasped. As for Lord Dong, you only need to compile a book and pass it on to His Majesty the King of the Kingdom to tell the chef who Nian Bing, whether you are afraid that Your Majesty will not call him into the palace? Without Nian Bing, it is only Mingyuan, so how could it be our great successor?\"\n\n\n\nJin Hao's eyes shining brightly, \"Okay, second brother, you deserve to be a think tank. Just do what you said, and do both methods at the same time. I will compile a book to Your Majesty tomorrow. At the same time, you send someone to monitor Mian Bing. You must find a strong evidence and understand?\"\n\n\n\nThe big shopkeeper and the second shopkeeper bowed and replied at the same time, and Liao Feng, who was standing beside him, showed a trace of disdain in his eyes. \n\n\n\n  …\n\n\n\nXue Jingyan sent Nian Bing and the other two out of the wind. The three of them left in Long Zhi's car. Along the way, who didn't say anything. Long Zhi kept closing his eyes, as if thinking about something.\n\n\n\nThe horse finally arrived at the Magicians Association. Long Zhi got off the car and said to his daughter, \"Spirit, you go back and rest first. Nian Bing and I have something to say.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling clicked his head, looked at Nian Bing and turned away.\n\n\n\n\"Nianbing, come with me.\" Long Zhi said with a heartless look on his face and turned around and walked out of the magician association. The two first-class magicians who were responsible for guarding the door saw him coming back, and hurriedly bowed respectfully.\n\n\n\nNian Bing and Long Zhi came to a huge top building. Nian Bing was very familiar with him. He was here to conduct magic tests on him.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi walked to the center of the hall together and stopped walking, facing Nian Bing, and said calmly: \"I really didn't expect that the magic of the same origin of ice and fire in the sequel to the sequel actually exists, or maybe you have written them, but you can't have cheated a magic guide. It's true that the explosion of flames was released by you with the rolling shaft, but the flame technique is your own power. I can clearly feel the fire-type magic power you released on you at that time. Now, I think you should tell me something. Nian Bing's magician.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing seemed to have thought of Long Zhi's doubts, smiled slightly, and said, \"Since I have made the Nine Ice and Fire Heaven Series, I have never thought of hiding anything. President, thank you for not taking me directly and then asking. It seems that I have not made any mistakes.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi turned around and looked at Nian Bing with a serious face, \"Cao, what are you gamble?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"I am catching your relationship with the Ice God Tower. Due to the pressure of the Ice God Tower, the trade association has never been able to emerge. As a devil's guide, you have not gained a proper position in the Ice Moon Empire. It is impossible without any mental changes. In fact, I know that your abilities to me are also It's just a guess, and I'm not sure. It's true that I'm a dual-type magician. However, I can tell you clearly, I'm. I have two magical abilities, ice and fire, and I'm the person I found by the Snow Goddess Priest. Her purpose for me was very simple, to take out the Snow Goddess Stone.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi's whole body was shocked and said, \"Are you really the one she is looking for?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing took out a cloth roll from the bottom and opened it. The dark scabbard appeared first. The tight joint was the hilt of the knife tightly laid by another cloth. There were several magical Chen symbols on this cloth.\"The Stone of the Ice Goddess is the top magic stone of ice. It is embedded in this knife. The knife is named Chenlu, and its quality is never under the auspicious sky. Now I can't show the Stone of the Ice God Tower to you. This is not too far from the Ice God Tower. I am afraid that the Snow God Sacrifice will feel its breath. Let's open the skylight and say it. I have been a chef for eight years. Eight years ago, I had a happy family, but for some reason, I was separated by the Snow God Sacrifice. She is the biggest hatred in my life. I have worked so hard to practice magic There is only one reason, that is, I hope that one day I will kill the Ice God Tower. And you also hope that the Ice God Tower will disappear from the mainland, so in terms of interests, we stand in the same camp, and as long as you allow, I will stay in the trade fair. Once my magic is powerful enough to compete with the Ice God God Sacrifice, then I will never have any hesitation. As for my true origin, I will not say it, or maybe you will know it in the future. I just want you to understand that the Ice God Sacrifice and the Ice God Pagoda are our common enemies.\" \n\n\n\n\"Nonsense.\" Long Zhi suddenly shouted, \"The Magicians and the Ice Moon Empire are all loyal to the Ice Moon Empire royal family. You said such a ruthless thing. I will take you down and send you to the Ice God Tower.\" A green light rolled out, and the surging wind magic power condensed towards Long Zhi. The powerful pressure tightened Nian Bing's whole body and subconsciously connected and retreated a few steps.\n\n\n\nNian Bing didn't say anything, and she flashed the light in her hand. She held the morning dew sword in one hand, and put the box with the Aotian sword on the ground with the other hand, and then quickly took out the Stone of the Fire God. \"A great God of Fire! Please allow me to borrow your left hand to let the flames descend into people, snatch all evil powers, let the flames shine on the earth, and destroy all obstacles that block the front. - The left hand of the God of Fire.\" A huge hand of flame appeared in front of Nian Bing at the same time as the spell ended. Under Nian Bing's control, he slapped at Long Zhi. With the increase of the Fire God Stone, the Fire God's left hand exerted the maximum power, and the central hall became hot and hot.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi snorted coldly, \"The pearl of rice grains also appears in light, letting you see what the power of the magician is.\" A blue staff suddenly appeared in his hands. The staff is very long, two meters long, with many strange patterns on it, scattering a quiet green light, and nine green stones at the top. Combine into a oriented row, pointing in front of the staff, Long Zhi shouted loudly, \"Break.\"\n\n\n\nA huge wind blade appeared, and the blade body that reached three meters long directly entered the left hand of the Fire God who was born from Nian Bing. In the huge wave, the Fire God's left hand was actually blown into a piece of Mars and disappeared, and the wind blade was torn to pieces in the explosion.\n\n\n\nUnder the air force, Nian Bing's face turned pale and he stepped back a few steps. The power of the same source of ice and fire in his body was shaking violently. Over the past few days, he had read almost all the magic books, and immediately recognized the magic used by Long Zhi, and said suddenly: \"Is this the six-level magic wind god? How is it possible that you can actually instantly use this magic.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi was also surprised. When he thought that his magic power was far above Nian Bing, and he broke through the fifth level with six levels. He should have destroyed the left hand of the God of Fire and then shattered Nian Bing, but now he has only stepped back a few steps.\n\n\n\n\"As a magic guide, the medium and low-level magic of the moment are nothing. Of course, the ability to achieve the sixth level of instant magic depends on the top divine magic staff Qingming in my hand. Unfortunately, the wind god is already limiting its momentum. The magic power that can be condensed through the Nine Blue Nether Stone can only be achieved by this. Moreover, it only once a day, and the Qingming Stone needs time to attract more elements. With my real power, the four-level magic of instant is easier, so just surrender.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled indifferently and said, \"Do you think I am the one who will recognize you if you don't resist? It's my blessing to be able to fight the magic commander.\" As he said, he retracted the morning dew sword and when his right hand appeared again, four magic rolls had been put in the finger.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi sneered, \"Is it that your middle and low-level magical axle also wants to compete with me?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled indifferently and said, \"I admit that in the magical realm, far away is not as good as you, but I have been trapped in such a fight. How can I know that I can't do it if I haven't tried it? Don't forget that the magical axes are smooth.\" As soon as the words fell, the four axes in his hand had already thrown out two.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi's face darkened, his eyes shone brightly, and when he pointed to the front of the green stick in his hand, a dazzling green light appeared, and it was another instant magic. However, this time it was much smaller, it was a four-level wind wall technique. However, he certainly would not think that four-level magic could withstand Nian Bing's attack. The magic guide's strength was undoubtedly at this moment. Eight wind wall techniques retracted, completely squeezing the space in front of him. For a while, the entire temple was crazy, and Long Zhi could no longer be seen from the front. \n\n\n\nThe strange thing happened. The two rolls thrown by Nian Bing were swept up by a fierce wind and kept dancing in the air, but there was no magic. Nian Bing smiled strangely, \"Ah! Sorry, what I just threw out was the rolls. Hehe.\"\n\n\n\nWhen he heard Nian Bing's voice, Long Zhiqi almost vomited, and the nine wind wall techniques were naturally useless. Not only that, he also held his attack. With a cold snorkeling, Long Zhi's low voice sounded rhythmically, and the chanting of the mantra began. Although the nine wind walls attacked Nian Bing in an instant magical attack, they also gained enough time for him. The higher the magic, the longer the time it needed to chant. In the crazy voice of the cries, Nian Bing could not hear any magic that Long Zhi chanted.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's face also became solemn. He stuffed the magic roll in his hand into the siege. At the same time, he took out the small ice stick, put the Fire God Stone in his left hand, and chanted his spell that he was good at... \"A big Fire God! Please allow me to borrow your left hand to let the flames descend into the people, snatch all evil powers, let the flames shine on the earth, and destroy all obstacles that block the front. - The left hand of the Fire God.\"The fire was shining, and the huge flame god's left hand appeared on the left side of Nian Bing, giving the palace that was originally rendered green by the wind wall art a little more red light.\n\n\n\n\"A big ice element! Condensate it, transform it into the ice of thousands of ancient cold rivers, transform it into the ice of condensed moonlight, the fusion of ice and ice appears, double-colored ice balls.\" Bingling pointed his finger at the slant, and the blue light condensed constantly, a huge ice puck filled with ice spikes, half-pure and half-deep blue appeared. This is the highest level of magic that Nian Bing can use now, the sixth-level double-colored ice ball.\n\n\n\nThe Fire God Stone and the Ice Staff were at the same time. Nian Bing's full gold was automatically erected without any wind under the slightest force of ignition and fire. The red and blue lights on the surface of his skin were alternately shining, and the magic spiral she had already rotated to the extreme.",

    "content": "\"Ah--\" Nian Bing shouted loudly, and the two surging red and blue lights emitted from the Fire God Stone and the Ice Staff were injected into the two completed magics.\n\n\n\nThe flame god's left hand clenched into a fist, and he was pressed in front of Nian Bing with the double-colored ice ball. With the continuous injection of magic power, their physical size did not increase continuously, but instead decreased.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's face became whiter and whiter, and his magic power had begun to overdraw during the continuous injection.\n\n\n\nThe green light suddenly disappeared, and the nine-layer wind wall art finally disappeared without the support of continuous magic. The two white rolls that Nian Bing threw before also fell to the ground.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi's skin appeared with a faint blush, as if the whole person had turned blue. The originally disappeared pressure became stronger again. Only his realistic gaze made the two magics in front of Nian Bing tremble.\n\n\n\nLooking at the two light groups in front of him, a group of light burst out in Long Zhi's eyes, \"Okay, I didn't see anything wrong. It's really the same source of ice and fire. But do you think these are useful to me?\" He swung the green stick in his hand, and a green light shot directly onto the wall of the hall. The originally calm wall seemed to be ignited by the green light, and the six colors of red, yellow, blue, blue and gold illuminated at the same time, constantly changing. Nian Bing, who is familiar with the magical ambus, naturally believed that this was a large forbidden magical ambus. Unless the attack power exceeded the scope that the magical ambus could bear, it would never be possible to damage the wall behind the magical ambus. It seems that Long Zhi was indeed using great magic.\n\n\n\nNian Bing didn't say anything. His spirit was completely on the two magics he had condensed. The Vulcan's left hand and the double-colored ice ball had condensed to half of the previous size at this time. \n\n\n\nLong Zhi looked at Nian Bing calmly, \"No, you have indeed realized the truth of magic. I want to see how much you can reduce the two magics. Tell you frankly, the magic I just used is used on yourself. It is a nine-level wind-type magic, or maybe you have heard it, A magic number is called the barrier of the wind-based magician. It is called the protection of the wind. It consumes magic power. Even with the ability of my magician, it can only support half a time at most. Under normal circumstances, no one may use this kind of magic, but today I will be able to deal with you. \"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's face changed slightly, and he certainly knew about Feng Shen's protection. This is a nine-level magic. But the attack was not at the ninth level. When this magic is used, it can instantly be used to have any magic below the seventh level, and the mana consumed is only one-third of the original one. It is generally only used when a wind magician is ready to surround or faces a large number of enemies.\n\n\n\n\"Fengxiang.\" The third-level Fengxiang technique carried Long Zhi to float up, and under his feet, a blue hexagram that was about one meter wide appeared under the protection of Fengshen.\n\n\n\n\"Ah--\" Nian Bing roared again. Under the full force of mental power, the body of the Vulcan's left hand and the double-colored ice ball instantly decreased by one third.With both hands, the red and blue light balls each set out an arc and flew towards Long Zhi in the air.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi's eyes showed a shocking light. He now underestimated Nian Bing's magical control.\n\n\n\n  A group of blue spirals appeared in front of the Qingming stick. The whirlwind instantly enlarged and at the same time, she covered Nian Bing's two magical magics. This is the seventh-level dragon storm. Of course, Long Zhi would not think that a seven-level magic can eliminate the two compressed magics of Nian Bing. He just wanted to try how powerful Nian Bing's magic is. \n\n\n\nNian Bing was moving, and his body was reluctant to support him. Both hands quickly pulled back, and the two light groups, red and blue, that were flying rapidly, stopped. His eyes were flashing strangely. Both hands suddenly closed forward and shouted, \"Ice-fire-same source.\" The magic that was supposed to move forward suddenly flew, and two compressed light balls crashed towards the other side at the same time.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi's face changed and he thought it was not good. At this time, the dragon storm he had already covered the light group that was about to collide.\n\n\n\n\"Roy--\" The magic elements in the entire hall suddenly became violent. The huge explosive force mixed with the red and blue light actually tore the seventh-level dragon roll wind to pieces. The red and blue lights rotated and condensed into a huge beam of light, and they suddenly moved towards Long Zhi. The expanded energy almost covered half of the hall.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi had a big eyebrows. It was the first time he had faced a strange magic like the same origin of ice and fire. He didn't know how he should deal with it. The green pole in his hand was swept away, and one dragon-rolling storm after another appeared, and the explosion of the huge magic power came on.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's whole body was soft and she sat down on the ground, unable to forget to spray out a mouthful of blood. The magic power was left with very little left due to overdraft. After all, supporting this magic of ice and fire simultaneous origin is too much for magic power or mental power. He had tried this magic before when he was cultivating the Taohua Forest, but he did not compress the magic at that time. The reason why he used a five-level and six-level is to balance the power of the two magics of ice and fire. The left hand of the Fire God used to use the Fire God Stone can definitely be comparable to a six-level magic in terms of power. Therefore, only a six-level double-colored ice ball can cooperate with it. If the ice and fire are of the same origin, the most basic requirement is that the power of the two magics of ice and fire must be balanced, so that they will not swallow each other and generate a large attack power. \n\n\n\nThe entire hall was trembling violently. The surrounding magical defenses were in a crazy manner, as if they could not bear the heavy pressure. The great magic power from the source of ice and fire was completely extinguished. Nian Bing only felt that even the red and blue lights were in front of him. Only with the ice stick in his hand could he support his body without falling down.Finally, everything was over, and the magic scene in the hall was still not broken, but the light had already dimmed a lot. The blue figure stepped out from the power of the light explosion. The magic robe of Long Zhi looked a little pleated, and the expression on his face was a little white, and the green light on his skin had disappeared.\n\n\n\n\"Okay, it's worthy of being the same as ice and fire. I really didn't expect that you could use magic with such powerful power. If you change to a magician, you might be injured in your hands without any preparation. You actually broke the protection of the nine-level spirit gods that I am famous for being powerful. The power of this ice and fire magic has approached about nine levels. Unfortunately, using this magic to use this magic, you have taken all your magic power, and the operation time is too long, enough for me to chant two or three nine-level spells. Will you give you such a chance if you change others?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingmeng sat upright, looked at Long Zhi and smiled gently, and said, \"Long, actually, ice and fire are the same origins, just a magical form, and are not real magic. The real name of the magic that I just used to be should be called the three slights of ice and fire. The first slight is the initial compression, and the second slight is the fusion in the air...\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi was stunned for a moment, and suddenly something bad suddenly appeared in his heart, \"Three veins of ice and fire?\" There was no sign of any sign. A fireball appears behind Long Zhi at the same time, and it is a five-level hot ball and a five-level single-color ice ball. They have no compression and no increase in magic items. However, their appearance is so abrupt. \n\n\n\nA huge sound of the wind, the two magics completely collided together, and the big red and blue light beams appeared again, not as powerful as before, but facing it was the unprepared Dragon Zhi.\n\n\n\nThe magician is not a warrior. Even if his brain can react, magic is not as good as the last wave of attack. But at least it is close to the seventh level.\n\n\n\nThe blue wind roared in anger, rolling out like a giant dragon, but it was still a dragon storm. In a huge situation, the magical siege was already snatching the magical siege and could no longer withstand the impact of magic. The six-colored light disappeared, and a huge impact force rose into the sky. The sharp house exploded in an instant, and the tiles and dust rose high with magic. Long Zhi fell forward a few steps and happened to come to Nian Bing. He slapped the green pole in his hand. A green wind wall appeared above the two people, resisting the tiles falling from the sky. But the gray wall rolled up next to the gray faces made by Nian Bing and Long Zhi.\n\n\n\nThe smoke completely disappeared, Nian Bing and Long Zhi were watching each other, and both of them became natives at this time, one stood and the other sat. Suddenly, they laughed at each other. In their laughter, Nian Bing said humorously: \"It seems that we still have the potential to become local magicians!\"\n\n\n\nAs the laughter stopped, Long Zhi looked at Nian Bing fiercely, \"Boy, you want to compensate for my losses. Do you know how much is a seventh-level magic rolling shaft worth?\"Just just in the final crisis, Long Zhi had no choice but to use a seven-level dragon storm magic ripple, which was able to successfully resist the last strike of the three ripples of ice and fire. It is not easy for Nian Bing to force the dignified demon director Long Zhi to this extent. \n\n\n\nNian Bing laughed and said, \"This is a good job, I will accompany you two sixth-level rolling axes. Dear Lord, what is the power of this newly developed extension rolling axes? Unfortunately, it is too difficult to make this thing. Otherwise, if you change it into two sixth-level rolling axes, you probably need to use eighth-level to get it.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi said unhappily: \"Okay, then I will be the same as those two just now. Don't think I can't see that. That axle also has a special fusion element with the same origin of ice and fire. Otherwise, it will be impossible for it to condense and attack me after the explosion.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at Long Zhi with a smile, \"Children, actually, I admire you very much. In order to show you the abilities I possess, I have calculated it. But I now, the gap is the gap. If it weren't for your not wanting to hurt me, I'm afraid my first magic would not be able to complete. The magician's power is actually powerful.\"\n\n\n\nAfter being picked up by Nian Bing, Long Zhi's face looked better, \"It seems that you knew from the beginning that I would definitely cooperate with you?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing snatched her shoulders and said, \"Not necessarily, right, but I am at least 80% sure. There has been a period of time in the trade fair. You have repeatedly criticized me. If you can't even see this, what are I still talking about with you? I won't deliberately reveal my spoils when cooking today. The reason I do this is because I will leave here soon. Before leaving, I hope to get the support of a powerful magician like you.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi sighed and helped Nian Bing up from the ground, \"It's true that I have no reason not to cooperate with you. It can be said that the Ice God Tower is my greatest wish. Although I am not too old, it is probably impossible to compete with the Ice and Snow God Priest in this life. The gap between the Demonic and the Goddess is something you can't imagine...\"\n\n\n\nHe just said that there was a sudden chaotic sound coming from outside. The two of them looked at the door and saw that several magicians, including Long Ling and Seijiu, came in together.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi's face darkened, \"What are you fucking in a panic? Depending on your appearance, how can you be a magician?\"\n\n\n\nWhen Liwang saw that Long Zhi was here, he relaxed his voice. Liwang stepped forward and said, \"God, what happened? Why did the top of the test hall suddenly explode? Is there a problem with the magic here?\" Looking at Long Zhi and Nian Binglang Feng, the magician thought about it, but he didn't dare to laugh.Long Zhi looked at the crowd, especially several of the demons, and said calmly: \"You are here and I have come. I happened to announce something. Although Nian Bing only has the power of a great magician, from now on, I officially announced that he has become a member of the senior and senior high school of the Trade Union. I have already had this plan, but this has been recently. He has been studying in the library for a while. Today everyone is here. In the future, no matter who will treat him with the elders, he will always treat him with the gift of the elders. The magic here is always damaged by the money and I was having sex with Nian Bing. Okay, Ling, Master Jiu, you two come to support Nian Bing and go back to his dormitory first. \"\n\n\n\nAfter saying that, Long Zhi put Nian Bing on the ground with the Aotian Knife and sent it to Long Ling, and then flew away in the Qingfeng package. After all, his appearance in a mess had a lot of impact on his identity.\n\n\n\nFor a while, all the magicians had not understood what happened? Lizun said to himself, \"The magical strength of the Test Hall is ten levels. Is it easy to break? Is it difficult to say that the time is too long, will the magic power be lost?\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling and Master Jiuyi were holding Nian Bing. When Long Ling saw the blood on the corner of Nian Bing's mouth, a trace of color flowed in his eyes. Nian Bing had been talking to Long Zhi before. At this time, the matter was over and he was in a semi-coma.",

    "content": "Early morning.\n\nStretching lazily, Nian Bing felt a wave of soreness throughout his body as he slowly woke from his slumber. The warm sunlight shone on his body, indescribably comfortable. For over a month, this was the first time he had truly slept instead of resting in meditation.\n\nAs his consciousness gradually returned, Nian Bing recalled everything that had happened last night. In the battle with Long Zhi, thanks to Long Zhi holding back, Nian Bing hadn't been truly injured. It was just that his magical power had been greatly depleted and his spiritual energy over-exhausted, which was why he had vomited blood and fainted. Although he hadn't recovered yet, it was no longer a serious issue.\n\nSlowly sitting up in bed, Nian Bing was surprised to find that he had been changed into a fresh set of clothes. He quickly felt inside his robes, only to discover with horror that the Flame God's Stone, the Morning Dew Knife, the Saint's Radiance Stone, the cloth pouch containing his Ghostly Carvings and other small tools, and the Proud Sky Knife were all gone. Even the magic scrolls he had painstakingly created had vanished. There was nothing left on his entire person. Feeling his chest, he found the Tianhua Plaque was still there. Perhaps it was because of it that his mind felt so stable.\n\nCold sweat trickled down his temples. Since leaving the Peach Blossom Forest, this was the first time Nian Bing had felt such dread. The Flame God's Stone and the Ice Goddess's Stone were the last things his parents had left for him at the Ice God Pagoda. For them to just disappear like this, what was he to do? Did Long Zhi take them? No, he wouldn't. He still had great use for him. The ones who helped him up last night seemed to be Long Ling and Shi Jiu. He was most wary of Shi Jiu. If it was him, then... I'm afraid…\n\nJust then, the sound of a door opening was heard. The sound was soft, but it still caught Nian Bing's attention. He hurriedly lay back down, resuming his previous posture.\n\nThe sound of light footsteps approached. A soft *clink* sounded, as if something had been placed on the table. A faint, fresh fragrance told Nian Bing who the visitor was. It was the scent of orchids; among the girls he knew, only Long Ling used this kind of perfume.\n\n\"Nian Bing, why aren't you awake yet? Father said that with your abilities, you should have been up by this morning!\" Sure enough, the voice belonged to Long Ling, her gentle tone filled with concern. Hearing her voice, Nian Bing felt a warmth spread through his heart. Long Ling had truly come to like him. In fact, she really was a good girl. Perhaps…\n\n\"Nian Bing, please wake up. Alright? Don't you know how worried this makes me? Father once told me to get closer to you. He thinks very highly of you. He even... even hoped you could become my husband. But your attitude toward me is no different from your attitude toward Jingjing. Even Rou'er, who has always had such high standards, has been drawn to you. I'm not sure what I feel for you now either. Perhaps I really do like you a little, but you're always so mysterious. I'm a little scared. Yesterday, I thought about it all night and decided to bury my feelings deep in my heart. Because I don't want a husband I constantly have to worry about—worrying you'll suddenly change, worrying you'll be snatched away by other girls. Perhaps a simple, ordinary husband would be more suitable for me. You know? Ling'er is very fragile and so afraid of getting hurt. I don't want to feel that kind of heartache. From today on, I will definitely see you as just a friend. Perhaps that's for the best, for you and for me.\"\n\nBy the end, Long Ling's voice was choked with sobs, and Nian Bing's newly warmed heart gradually grew cold again. That's right. What could I give Long Ling? She's so gentle, so kind; she isn't suited to be with me at all. If I forced it, the result would only be her getting hurt. Her decision was the right one. Was it really my own ambiguous attitude that caused these girls to develop feelings for me? Nian Bing, oh Nian Bing, for you, Father and Mother are what's most important. Since you can't truly give them what they need, it's better to let go of these things early, just as Ling'er said. A man must walk the path he is meant to walk.\n\nSuddenly, he felt a warm wetness on his forehead. Nian Bing's whole body stiffened. An intoxicating fragrance washed over him. It seemed to be Long Ling's lips. She kissed him gently, her voice like a murmur. \"Nian Bing, I wish you well. I'll always wish you well.\"\n\nLong Ling left, and the room returned to silence. Nian Bing sat up again and saw a tray on the table by the bed. On the tray was the same bowl of congee, two steamed buns, and a dish of pickled vegetables. Nian Bing's breakfast was the same every day, but for some reason, he suddenly found that despite his hunger, he couldn't bring himself to eat. It felt as if something was stuck in his throat.\n\n\"Ling'er, I'm sorry. I too will wish you well, forever and always. If... if it's not too late when I one day return, then I will definitely come find you. And eat the breakfast you bring every day.\"\n\nA new day, a bright and sunny day, and a day when Ice Snow City was boiling with excitement.\n\nEarly in the morning, news that the Grand Achievement Pavilion had been defeated in a contest by the Pure Wind House spread throughout all of Ice Snow City. Someone, no one knew who, began describing Nian Bing's culinary skills in divine terms, and four words spread to every corner of the city.¹\n\nAlthough Xue Ji had long anticipated this situation, he hadn't expected it to be so frenzied. From early morning, the entrance to the Pure Wind House was blocked by patrons eligible to dine there, all of them vying to see what this chef who cooked with magic looked like, what the man who made Gold Chef Liao Feng concede defeat looked like. The Pure Wind House's business grew by several multiples. Left with no choice, Xue Ji had to make an announcement, stating that Nian Bing would personally cook only one dish per day, and this dish would be offered to customers by auction. The prices for all other dishes at the Pure Wind House would remain unchanged. This finally managed to calm the surging crowds. Of course, if the Pure Wind House didn't have the backing of a powerful faction, those nobles would have started causing trouble long ago.\n\nIn stark contrast, the prosperity of the Pure Wind House highlighted the decline of the Grand Achievement Pavilion. For the entire day, the number of customers at the Grand Achievement Pavilion was so few one could catch sparrows on its doorstep. The whole establishment seemed exceptionally deserted; even the young women responsible for greeting guests at the door were yawning one after another from boredom.\n\nDuring the day, Nian Bing didn't go to the library again. Instead, he spent the entire day meditating in his room, as he needed to recover his lost magical power. At the same time, he needed to calm his mind and forget the morning's troubles.\n\nThat evening, having recovered a portion of his magical power, Nian Bing was quietly picked up by a carriage and taken to the Pure Wind House. The one who came for him was once again Xue Jing.\n\n\"Hey, are you a block of wood? You haven't said a single word this whole time,\" Xue Jing said to Nian Bing, disgruntled, as they were about to reach the back entrance of the Pure Wind House. On the way there, she had given him a detailed and non-stop account of the day's excitement at the restaurant. But Nian Bing hadn't shown the slightest reaction, just sitting there listening.\n\n\"What do you want me to say? Jingjing, this is actually what I fear the most. My master once told me that if I ever revealed my culinary skills in a place, I should leave immediately. The agreement I made with Uncle Xue has already violated my master's words. This month will probably be very difficult to get through.\"\n\nXue Jing paused for a moment. \"You don't want to be famous?\"\n\nNian Bing's brow furrowed. Looking at the spirited young woman before him, he said, \"Do you think I learned to cook for fame and fortune? I have never thought about those things. If that's what you believe, then I can tell you for certain, you're wrong. However, you can rest assured. Since I promised Uncle Xue a period of one month, I will definitely complete this month's work.\"\n\nXue Jing looked at Nian Bing, and her tone suddenly filled with concern. \"What's wrong with you today? I feel like you're acting a bit strange.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head. \"Don't worry, I'm fine. After I finish making the dish, could you please have the carriage take me back to the Association? Also, please thank Uncle Xue for me, thank him for his understanding.\"\n\nXue Jing said, \"It's nothing to thank him for, really. Father says that rarity creates value. Making only one dish a day will better display the prestige of your cooking! Besides, I don't want you to be too tired either.\"\n\nThe carriage arrived, and Nian Bing followed Xue Jing into the Pure Wind House. From a distance, he could already hear the noisy chatter of discussions, and an inexplicable vexation rose in his heart. The time it took to cook a meal passed. When Nian Bing left again through the back door, he could only faintly hear someone in the Pure Wind House shouting out prices, the highest already reaching twenty purple-gold coins. Was a single dish really worth that much?\n\nBecause the Pure Wind House was so busy, Xue Jing didn't see Nian Bing off. He rode back to the Mage's Association alone in the carriage. He hadn't seen Long Zhi or his daughter all day. By the time his meditation ended, it was already evening, and he had to leave the Association with Xue Jing to go to the Pure Wind House. Thus, the whereabouts of his precious items remained unknown.\n\n\"Brother, how are you back so soon? I thought you'd be at least a *shichen*² later.\" The moment Nian Bing stepped out of the Pure Wind House's carriage, he heard Shi Jiu's voice from the Association's gatehouse.\n\n\"Big Brother, were you waiting here for me specifically?\" Nian Bing asked, a little surprised.\n\nShi Jiu grinned. \"Yeah! Master told me to wait for you here. He said to tell you to go find him on the third floor of the library as soon as you got back. He's waiting for you there. Oh, right, you owe me one. I was the one who changed your clothes last night and gave you a quick wash. Luckily, you weren't too dirty. Sigh, I don't know why, but Ling'er has seemed really unhappy these last few days. I spent all day trying to cheer her up, but nothing changed.\"\n\nNian Bing suddenly felt that Shi Jiu wasn't so annoying after all. At least his feelings for Long Ling were genuine. After bidding farewell to Shi Jiu, Nian Bing headed for the library. Back at the Mage's Association, his mood had calmed considerably. The thing he most wanted to do now was to leave Ice Snow City as soon as possible, to leave all this clamor behind. And before that, learning the magic he needed was, of course, the most important thing.\n\nUpon ascending to the third floor of the library, Nian Bing immediately saw Long Zhi standing there. In his hands was a book Nian Bing knew well—the very one on magic arrays he had been reading yesterday.\n\nClosing the book, Long Zhi turned his gaze to Nian Bing. \"You're back.\"\n\nNian Bing walked over to Long Zhi. \"Have you been waiting for me?\"\n\nLong Zhi smiled faintly. \"I've been here all day because I've been wanting to know why you can produce different results from the same things. Can you tell me the answer?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Insight.\"\n\n\"Is it that simple?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, taking the book on magic from Long Zhi's hands. \"The answer isn't actually here, but on the second floor. There's a book there called 'Basic Theory of Magic Arrays.' The President can take a close look at it when he has a chance. The truth is, my ability to create magic arrays with various effects isn't entirely because my magical control surpasses my magic power—you should understand this point as well. More importantly, I'm not just memorizing this stuff; I'm adding my own understanding. I try to comprehend the inner meaning of these magic arrays.\"\n\nA light flashed in Long Zhi's eyes. \"Insight. What a powerful word.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Actually, from the very first day I began learning culinary arts from my master, he taught me that one cannot rely solely on practice. Practice is of course important, but if you can find a good method of practice, you can achieve twice the result with half the effort. And that method needs to be found by oneself through insight. Everyone has a different path. If you can find the straightest path, you can reach the destination in the shortest time. This is true for cooking, and it is also true for magic.\"\n\nLong Zhi smiled. \"Kid, do you know why I was waiting for you here today?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head.\n\nLong Zhi smiled faintly. \"I was going to be your teacher, but I never expected you to teach me a lesson first. Now I'm starting to doubt whether I'm even qualified to be your master.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes lit up. \"Of course you are. Your years of understanding magic alone are something I am far from matching.\"\n\nLong Zhi sighed. \"No. Perhaps my overall understanding of magic is superior to yours, but when it comes to understanding the true essence of magic, you are already ahead of me. Nian Bing, I hope you will agree to a condition of mine.\" He paused after saying this.\n\nNian Bing looked at Long Zhi. He knew this condition was crucial to his relationship with Long Zhi. As long as he agreed, Long Zhi would help him without reservation. In his current situation, did he have any room to choose? No. The help of a Magister, and a Magister who shared a common enemy, would save him countless hours and immense effort. He had no reason to refuse his condition. Nodding, Nian Bing said, \"Please, tell me. As long as it's something I can do.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ The \"four words\" (四個字) likely refers to the idiom 神乎其技 (shén hū qí jì), which means \"supernatural skill\" or \"divine-like skill.\"\n² A *shichen* (時辰) is a traditional Chinese unit of time equal to two hours.",

    "content": "The smile on Long Zhi's face disappeared and he said seriously, \"I hope that if one day I die, you can take over my current position and help me take good care of the spirit. Can you answer me?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"You seem to have two conditions. Take care of it? I hope you can understand it.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi said lightly, \"I am a father. I just want my daughter to be happy. As long as you can make the spirit happy, I don't care about how you take care of me. This is a promise. At least, when I am alive, I still have the ability to take care of my daughter.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing relaxed her breath and said with a slight note: \"With my ability, I will definitely take good care of her. If one day you are about to die, please come back first.\" Although his words were very plain, his words were full of strength. Nian Bing made a promise for the first time since his lifetime.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi smiled, \"The man doesn't need to say too much about his promises. What about another condition?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingmei had a slight head and said, \"I know you really hope that the Magician Association of the Ice Moon Empire can be vigorously promoted, but you should also understand that the Association is just a slaughter now.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi laughed and said, \"Of course it's a sacrificial child. If it weren't for that, why would I say it was a condition? My eldest son is just a good name now. The amount of magic that can really work in his hand is just a dozen people, which is at least compared to other empires. With hundreds of great magicians or above, I am a magician. However, I believe that if it is to be inherited by you, this situation will definitely improve. Of course, I will work hard to help you in my lifetime. This condition is also the most important one.\" \n\n\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath and clearly felt that the stool on his shoulders had become much heavier. \"Since there is no choice, I agree. However, for at least eight years, I will not fulfill this statement. I need to complete the teacher's wishes. In eight years, I will definitely return here, and that will be the starting point for me to start fighting against the Ice God Tower.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi's eyes showed a gleeful light, \"Okay, we'll make a decision. You kneel down.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing took a step back and heard a sound. He knelt on the ground with both knees and said respectfully, \"Disciple, please see the teacher.\" After speaking, he respectfully knocked three heads at Long Zhi.\n\n\n\nAfter Long Zhitai received the gift, he helped Nian Bing up, \"Nian Bing, you know that being able to worship a magician as your teacher is something that many magicians have always dreamed of. Judging from your appearance, it seems that you are not very happy.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said with a funny look, \"How excited do you think I should be? After all, we are a combination of interests.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi said frankly: \"I admit this, but since you are my disciple and have made a promise to me, from now on, I have no reservations about you and will treat you like I treat the spirit. Originally, all my hopes were on the spirit, but she was actually a girl. I was a little worried. Now with you, everything will definitely be better.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"As a man, what he said is like water pouring out. I will definitely complete my promise. However, I do not guarantee that the trade fair will be prosperous in my hands in the future, but at least it will not become worse.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi smiled and said, \"Sister, teach, teach, and solve doubts. Now, I should start fulfilling my duties. From today on to the day before you leave the Ice City, this is your class.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said with some surprise: \"You don't seem to want to let me stay at all.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi pointed his head and said, \"That's true, you can't stay. Do you know who has just arrived?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned and said, \"Who?\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi took a deep breath and said, \"It's Liao Feng. Yesterday, your risk was too great. Liao Feng was arrogant, but he also had a sense of justice. He always disdained some dark things. He told me that Jin Hao, who is a great success, is ready to deal with you. One way is to check whether you are the person you are the one who was the sacrificial goddess of ice and snow, while the other is to go to the royal family to let the king of kings talk you into the palace as a chef. These two years, no matter which success, will be very unfavorable to you. Therefore, you must leave the Ice and Snow City and leave secretly.\n\n\n\nNian Bing was shocked, but soon calmed down. \"I think it's not easy for me to do things without leaving any trace. It's probably not that easy for them to find out if I'm the person Ice and Snow Goddess's priest. As for me to reach the Imperial Palace, it's a bit more cumbersome. However, the journey from here to Bingyue City is not close. Even if you can go there with all your might, it will take at least one and a half months to come back.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi clicked the head and said, \"It's not wrong. It takes one and a half months to get back from Ice and Snow City to Ice and Moon City on the way. However, His Majesty the King of the Kingdom has always had heavy troops around Ice and Moon City. Even if there is a copy of the document, it will take several days to wait during the inspection. The Soul Royal Knight there The group, and the highest sect of the Riders Group is Brother Xue Po, the brother Xue Po. If we pass by the magical winds of the duck, let Xue Po Yuan delay the time, at least one and a half months to two months. In this way, the time will be sufficient. I should be able to impart my knowledge to you.\" \n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"In two months, it should be enough.\" In two months, Zhengyang's carving should be completed.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi said, \"Then let's start now. Nianbing, I hope you can tell me about how to possess the special magic power of the same origin of ice and fire without reservation.\"\n\n\n\nI missed Bing and said, \"My parents are both magicians. Originally, I have always practiced fire magic with my father. When I was ten years old, I went to the Ice God Tower with my father to look for my mother, but I encountered the obstacles of the Ice God Sacrifice. My father was far from being a match for the Ice God Sacrifice. In the end, they tried their best to stop the Ice God Sacrifice, and gave me the Fire God Stone and the Ice God Stone, so that I could use a space to transfer and escape from the scene. If I guessed well, they might have been killed.\"He said it very simply and did not discuss the situation at that time. However, deep hatred had already appeared in his eyes.\n\n\n\nLong Zhi said with a eyebrows: \"So, should your mother be a person in the Ice God Tower? The Ice God Tower has always been rules, and women are definitely not allowed to get married. You were already ten years old at that time, and your mother was still alive. It seems that her status in the Ice God Tower should be very high.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said coldly, \"High? What's the use of high? For the Ice God Tower, it's a must-have, I don't want to say the specific situation. The memories of those years were too painful for me. I hate it so much, not only I hate the Ice God Tower, but also those who are pursuing us. Later, in order to avoid the pursuit of magic masters in the Ice God Tower, I jumped into the Sky Blue River and flowed down the river. At that time, I thought I was going to die. However, I never expected that I was actually occupied by the teacher's online website and was able to give birth. My teacher was a ghost chef who was famous in the mainland. The teacher saw that I could learn some basic magic. I was extremely excited. After accepting me as my disciple, I began to teach me the art of the art carefully. At that time, I also began to practice magic. At that time, I was surprised that there was a cold current in my body...\" At that time, Nian Bing carefully explained the process of practicing magic over the years. \n\n\n\nAfter listening to Nian Bing’s account, Long Zhi became suspicious, \"In this way, it was the jade in your chest that awakened your mind in time, which allowed you to merge the two magics together. Nian Bing, do you know that this is not a true fusion. You have always been in a very dangerous situation!\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"Of course I know, if it weren't for this, how could I come to the trade fair? One of my purposes here is to find knowledge about the magic of the same origin of ice and fire, and hope to resolve the crisis hidden in the body of magic power.\"\n\n\n\nAfter thinking about it, Long Zhi said in a deep voice: \"It's very difficult. I tell you frankly that even the four branches of the library do not have any knowledge about the same origin of ice and fire. I'm afraid that even the magicians in several other empires will not exist. Because the magicians in the same origin of ice and fire only exist in the passage.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing felt cold in his heart and asked, \"Then there is no other way? I can't tell you, I really want to continue like this? I have a feeling that if my magic power reaches a certain level, the current ice and fire spinning will be destroyed. At that time, during the process of their pricking each other, I am afraid my body will explode.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi slammed his head and said, \"No, you don't need to be too sad. Like your current situation, it has been a thousand years of hardship. Since you can keep ice and fire invincible, it is proved that your own quality has special characteristics. In addition, you have been practicing this way for many years, and your body is facing ice and fire. The two magic elements have gradually been adapted. What you need now is the machine. If you can truly merge your ice and fire magic elements in special circumstances, then you will truly become the only magician of the same origin of ice and fire in the mainland. Didn’t you say that you had realized it?If you want to integrate them, you need to understand it yourself. Now we don’t know how much magic power this ice and fire spiral in your body can withstand. Before it reaches its peak, you must understand the secrets. \"As he said, Long Zhi grabbed Nian Bing's hand, and the soft wind-type magic power slowly merged into Nian Bing's body. \n\n\n\nNian Bing only felt that her whole body was blown over by the wind, and her entire body was wrapped in the Fengyuan system. After a while, Long Zhi relaxed his hand. He didn't say anything. His right hand slammed into the air. The morning dew sword wrapped in a roll and the fire god stone appeared in his hands at the same time. He put two magic items into Nian Bing's hands and held his wrist again.\n\n\n\nTime passed minute by minute, and after half a time, Long Zhi increased his energy and relaxed his mind.\n\n\n\n\"Okay, the Stone of the Ice Goddess and the Stone of the Fire God are worthy of being top-level treasures. The reason why you can reach your current state is inseparable from their existence. Just now, I clearly felt that when these two treasures entered your hands, the ice and fire spiral of your energy obviously accelerated the rotation degree. If this spiral wants to continue If you continue to maintain it, you must keep rotating. Only in this way can ice and fire be invincible. As long as you keep these two stones on your body, unless your magic power is strong enough to fill your whole body, it will keep rotating. In addition, the stable effect of the warm jade on your chest will not happen.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing felt relieved and asked, \"Master, your whole body is filled with magic power. What realm is it to be focused on?\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi smiled slightly and said, \"The magic power is poured into the whole body, which is the symbol of entering the realm of the Demonic Guidance. You have learned it very early. If you cannot understand the secret of the same origin of ice and fire before reaching the realm of the Demonic Guidance, then you can only seal your body and prevent your magic power from increasing. In that case, although you will never reach the highest level of magic, there is no problem in saving your life. With the same origin of the Demonic Guidance and the power of the Demonic Guidance, your strength will definitely not be worse than mine.\"\n\n\n\nWith Long Zhi's explanation, Nian Bington, who had been confused by the problem of the same origin of ice and fire, suddenly became clear. Although he had not really solved the problem, he felt much better when he learned that his life would not be threatened, at least he would dare to let go in the future. Nian Bing has always missed his own understanding, not to mention that he has found some solutions to the problem from the magical world, but he is still immature. \"\n\n\n\n\"Teacher, thank you, I have sex, it is difficult for me to have the same origin of ice and fire.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi smiled slightly and said, \"Since you worship me as a teacher, I can't accept you as a disciple in vain. I'll give you a meeting. Yesterday, I asked Ling and Master Jiu to take you back to the room. Later, I thought that there were so many treasures on you, and you were in a coma, which was a bit inappropriate. So I took away all your things. Don't you wonder why the Stone of the Fire God and your cold knife suddenly appeared? Look, they were actually installed here.\"As he said, Long Zhi stretched out his right hand to Nian Bing.\n\n\n\nNian Bing only then saw that Long Zhi was wearing a black ring in his hand. The ring looked very simple, like an iron ring, inconspicuous. Long Zhi took off the ring and smiled and said, \"Don't underestimate it. It is a magical item of dark gold. Alas, to put it, our trade fair is really nasty, and there are few magical items to be sluggish! This ring is called the Ring of Space. The metal made by itself is extremely special, and it is a magical item used for storage in space. You know, generally magicians will bring a lot of things when they go out, and our bodies are relatively weak. Siddon, how can I take it? Space storage magic items are a must-have for a high-level magician. Generally speaking, a ring is the best because it is small and easier to carry. This ring can store ten cubic meters of things. If you use it for enough, I will put all your treasures here.\" As he said, Long Zhi's wrist trembled, and a magic power was injected into the ring, and his Qingming Staff appeared in vain.",

    "content": "He sent the ring to Nian Bing and said, \"There is no more mine here, you can bring it. Although it is a magical item in space, because the magical aura of Su Han is extremely clever, any kind of magic power injected into it, combined with your own mental power, you can take out the things you saved in advance from it.\"\n\n\n\n  Received the ring, Nian Bing consciously exploring his mental power into the ring. Sure enough, what he felt was a wide space, and his own things were in this space. With a thought, he injected mana power into the ring. Under the control of his mental power, the morning dew sword and the fire god stone in his hand disappeared and appeared in the empty space.\n\n\n\nI felt excited. What Nian Bing needs most now is this thing. He hurriedly said to Long Zhi, \"Teacher, thank you.\"\n\n\n\nLong Zhi laughed and said, \"I heard this sentence the most sincerely. Okay, let's start researching it. If you have any questions you don't understand, you can ask me immediately.\"\n\n\n\nStarting from this evening, Nian Bing went into a regular life. In addition to the necessary washing up, Long Zhi rarely left the library, and food and drink were sent to the library by Long Ling. Under Long Zhi's guidance, it is much easier for Nian Bing to read books. Some things do not need to be pondered by themselves. Long Zhi directly gave a very precise understanding, and his understanding of magic itself was also explained to Nian Bing. Although the two people have different magical systems, with Long Zhi's help, Nian Bing's understanding of the magical domain became more and more profound. The third level of reading books has also accelerated a lot. Every night, the windy horse will come to pick up Nianbing at any time. He always left in a hurry and returned in a hurry. Learning magic was what he hoped for the most.\n\n \n\n  Unknown to me, it was already the last day when Nian Bing obeyed and Xue Xiang's words, although a month had passed. However, Qingfeng's business has been in full swing, especially Nian Bing's daily axe dishes, which have not been repeated once in thirty days. The price has even risen from the beginning of several tens of purple gold coins to the current hundreds of purple gold coins.\n\n\n\nAfter completing today's dishes, Nian Bing did not leave as anxiously as usual. These days, he has been cooking with the stove at Mingyuan's special door. Every time he cooks, he asks Mingyuan to watch. As long as possible, let the action be slower so that the Mingyuan can see more clearly.\n\n\n\n\"Master Ming. You can see the method just now.\" Nian Bing washed his hands and took off the chef's hat from his head.\n\n\n\nMingyuan said sincerely, \"It turns out that this is still possible, Nian Bing, you have taught me a lot in this month! Thank you very much. Although you are younger than me, I still want to call you a teacher.\" As he said, he bowed to Nian Bing.\n\n\n\nNian Bing was startled and hurriedly supported Mingyuan, \"Mr. Ming, you don't want to do this. Although we have been together for less than half a day for these days, some of your insights have also helped me a lot. We are just a discussion between each other.\"\n\n\n\nMingyuan said seriously, \"Ignon Bing. Do you know?All along, I thought my art was difficult to improve. But, this month has passed. You let me see how you cook without any loss and explain the secrets in it to me. I think even if Liao Feng comes again, he will never win me. You let me see another big door on the ground. In fact, even without magic, you are definitely a top-notch chef! \"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, and said nothing more, and she lifted the chef and walked out of this ten square meters of Mingyuan area. As soon as he came out, he was immediately startled. All the chefs stopped their work and looked at him respectfully.\n\n\n\n\"What are you doing this? I think there are still many guests waiting outside. Let's continue.\"\n\n\n\n\"They are thanking you, just like I want to thank you too. I miss you! You brought the whole clear wind to a new level.\" With the appearance of the voice, Xue Jiao and his daughter left. Under the snowy head, his palms sounded like thunder. Those peerless eyes made Nian Bing feel hot and blood boiling. After all, he was still a young man.\n\n\n\n\"Uncle Xue. Thank you for your care over the past few days.\" Nian Bing said to Xue Jin.\n\n\n\nXue Xiao smiled and said, \"No, it should be that you took care of me. How I hope this month will be extended indefinitely! But I know you are a horned person and should fly further. Brother Long and I have already discussed it. Don't worry, I will never use any reason to keep you. I just hope that you will come back when you have time.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing thought for a while and said, \"Uncle Xue, I think it is necessary for you to continue your auction. I think Master Ming’s chef is fully qualified to be paid. Tomorrow, you can conduct the auction first, and then announce that I have left. As long as the guests taste the dishes made by Master Ming, there should be no dissatisfaction.\"\n\n\n\nMingyuan has also come out at this time, and he pointed it out, saying, \"What Nian Bing said makes sense. As long as he is not a real foodie, it is difficult to taste the difference between me and the dishes made by Nian Bing. Nian Bing, I really want to know, you have used your real skills in these days. I understand, you have not used all your efforts to keep the wind in the future, right?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"It's about 70%.\"\n\n\n\nMing Yuan said in a silence: \"Only 70% is within my reach. The chef has no end. I hope you can make greater progress in the future.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bingguan said, \"This is also my goal. Don't worry, I will definitely work hard.\" As he said, he injected magic power into the space ring on his finger. Ten magic rolls appeared in his hands, and there was also a piece of paper that appeared. Each magic roll is scattered with a different colored strap.\n\n\n\nNian Bing handed over the rolling axle and the paper to Xue Jing, \"This is the rolling axle I promise, and each one is my hard work. I have already stated on the paper how they are used, all of which are double magic rolling axle. In critical moments, you just need to turn on the rolling axle and you can use it directly.\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing took the scroll and didn't even look at it. A faint light appeared in her eyes and she said lightly, \"You really want to leave?\"\n\n\n\nI thought I had a firm decision. \"If you choose the path you should take, you can't turn around.\"\n\n\n\nXueqian said, \"Yujing, please send Nianbing out.\"\n\n\n\nThe snow sounded lightly and walked out of the kitchen first. Nian Bing said goodbye to Xueyan, Mingyuan and the chef and followed him out.\n\n\n\nThe night is so quiet, and only the occasional sound of the leaves will add a little vitality to this quiet night sky. Walking on the small side leading to the back of the clear wind, the fragrance of the plants comes over.\n\n\n\n\"Nianbing, are you disturbing me?\" Xue Jingu, who was walking in front, suddenly stopped. \n\n\n\nNian Bing walked to her, \"Why do you say this?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing turned around and looked at Nian Bing, \"If not, then why are you always hiding from me?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Don't you like Yan Feng? If he comes to find you, will you miss it when you see you are with me?\"\n\n\n\nXue Jing's voice suddenly increased a little. \"What? Is this your reason? Can you tell me that when you just came to Qingfeng and Dacheng to compete, Yan Feng had already left the Ice City and was recalled by His Majesty the King of the Kingdom?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing was stunned and said, \"I don't know. Apart from coming to Qingfeng, I have been in the picture of the Magician Association these days?\" Although I said this, I thought in my heart. Fortunately, this Yan Juhua has left, otherwise, he will come to find him again, and I really don’t know how to face it.\n\n\n\nXue Jinghu snorted and said, \"Forget it. You go.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh. Then I'll leave, maybe I won't inform you again when I leave the Ice City.\" After saying that, Nian Bing walked towards the back door with big strides.\n\n\n\n\"You're really leaving!\" Xue Jing's voice sounded from behind, forcing Nian Bing to come back.\n\n\n\nA piece of red cloud suddenly came up. Nian Bing's whole body was shocked, and she was unable to stand firmly, subconsciously slapped Xue Jing's elastic stern. A pain on his shoulder. When he looked down, it was Xue Jing who bit his shoulder heavily. Nian Bing did not move or exclaim, but just looked at the girl with a wry smile.\n\n\n\nXue Jing pushed Nian Bing away violently and said with regret: \"You are dead, go quickly.\"\n\n\n\nLooking at her red eyes, Nian Bing felt a secret in her heart, but he didn't dare to do more indirectly, so he hurriedly walked out of the clear wind. Looking at his back as he left, a smile suddenly appeared on Xue Jing's face, \"Hmph, you're leaving, you have legs, I have the same ones.\"\n\n\n\nAfter the wind was cleared, Nian Bing did not take the prepared horse, and he walked along the street. He had been learning magic these days, so he really needed to relax.\n\n\n\nJust as he walked out of Central Street, the sound of horse hooves and carriage suddenly rose. Nian Bing looked back and thought to himself, could it be that the horse was chasing him?It's true that a horse is not a breeze, but this horse is thought of as a ice-filled person.\n\n\n\nThe horse stopped by him, and Luo Rou's pretty face, which was not aware of people, came out of the car, \"Go on.\"\n\n\n\nNian Binghuan said with a eyebrows, \"I thank you for your kindness, but I want to take a walk by myself.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou said angrily, \"How can I be a Hongshuifeng? Apart from the first time I met, why do I want to hide quickly every time you see me?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"Miss, don't forget that you are already a fiancé. It seems inappropriate to live with a lonely man and a widow.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou suddenly felt a sense of sadness, \"Can you get on the car?\" Although she was asking, her voice sounded very weak. Nian Bing didn't feel bad about Luo Rou, so she finally got on the horse.\n\n\n\nSitting opposite Luo Rou, Nian Bing looked at her and said, \"Miss Zhiwei, are you having something to do with me?\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou looked at Nian Bing. At this time, she looked so weak. \"Nian Bing, call me Rou. I think we can be considered friends too. Today is the last day you are clearing the wind, and I am waiting for you outside.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at Luo Rou and said, \"What do you seem to have to worry about? In the Ice and Snow City, you can say that you are the daughter of heaven. Even Jing and Ling Er are not as good as you. How can you be more difficult?\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou pointed at the head and said, \"Of course there is. Do you know why everyone, including those officials, is a little respectful to me? That's not just because of my wisdom, but also because of my marriage.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's heart was moved and said, \"This way, your fiancé should have a very strong status in the Ice Moon Empire.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Ju said: \"No, my fiancé is the fifth prince of His Majesty the King of the Bingyue Empire. He is also the prince who is most loved and most hoped to inherit the throne. When I was very young, I began to like to sell my own wisdom. It is not wrong. This has indeed brought me great honor, but how did I know when I was young? It also brought me the biggest I don't know when my affairs were transferred to the palace. At that time, my father was just a small baron. His Majesty the King of the Kingdom knew where he learned about these things and summoned us father and daughter. At the banquet at the palace, His Majesty asked me three difficult questions. I was young and energetic and gave correct answers one by one. My misfortune began from the beginning of the year.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"Your Majesty the King of China must appreciate your wisdom. With your appearance and noble family background, he has made a decision for you and the fifth prince. Is it? Since the fifth prince can get the recognition of His Majesty the King of China, he must have a good ability. Since that's the case, it's not bad for you to marry him.\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou snorted and said, \"Nothing is wrong? How could you hear the sentence that the door to the palace is as deep as the sea?The ability of the fifth prince is indeed very good. When I was a child, I also met him in the imperial palace. His appearance is also the best choice. However, his ability is also in other aspects. As far as I know, he now has sixteen concubines. Do you think, what happiness can I get when I marry such a person? At most, I will be a queen in the future, that's all, but that's not the life I hope to live. I am already eighteen years old. In two years, when I am twenty, I will become a fifth prince who is two years older than me. How can I get sick? \"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"Then what decision do you have? Should you marry or not?\"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou said with sternness: \"Marry, of course we have to marry. Do I have the right to choose? I also have to think about my father and mother. If I marry the fifth prince, my father's official position will naturally rise even further. If I don't marry, my family will suffer. I have no choice at all.\"",

    "content": "\"Rou'er, I still don't understand what you mean? You came to find me today, it should only be to tell me these things, right?\" Nian Bing realized he was increasingly moved by Luo Rou, so he simply got straight to the point. He absolutely didn't want his decision to be affected by emotions.\n\nLuo Rou's expression subtly changed. She sighed lightly and said, \"I really do want to ask for your help. I heard you'll be leaving here to travel the continent soon. I want to ask you to help me deliver a letter to the Aolan Empire. Moreover, this letter absolutely cannot be obtained by anyone from the Ice Moon Empire. If you can help me with this, perhaps I won't have to marry the Fifth Prince.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"To whom in the Aolan Empire should it be delivered?\"\n\nLuo Rou said, \"Deliver it to the Aolan Imperial Capital, to Marquis Lan Yu's youngest daughter. Oh, no, Marquis Lan Yu was promoted to Duke last year. His youngest daughter's name is Lan Chen. Duke Lan Yu is very famous in the Aolan Empire; you'll definitely be able to find out about him when you get there. Anyway, you're going to travel, and the Ice Moon Empire borders the Aolan Empire, so please help me with this, okay?\"\n\nDelivering a letter wasn't a difficult task. After all, it concerned Luo Rou's lifelong happiness. Nian Bing nodded and said, \"I hope there won't be any trouble.\"\n\nLuo Rou said joyfully, \"So, you're agreeing then.\" As she spoke, she took out a letter and a small bead emitting a soft white light from her bosom and handed them to Nian Bing, saying, \"This bead is a token; with this letter, Lan Chen will surely trust you.\"\n\nNian Bing took them into his hand and was suddenly surprised to find that the smooth bead had a familiar warmth to it. It was actually made of tallow-white jade. Without looking closer, he waved his hand and put both the letter and the bead into his Spatial Ring.\n\nThe carriage arrived at the entrance of the Magician Guild and stopped. Nian Bing said to Luo Rou, \"I will do my best to deliver the letter for you. I'm leaving. Goodbye.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Luo Rou suddenly leaned close to Nian Bing and lightly kissed his cheek. A faint, refreshing scent instantly left Nian Bing stunned. Gratitude shone in Luo Rou's eyes. \"Nian Bing, thank you. If I ever caused you any trouble before, please forgive me. Actually, you're a good person.\"\n\nTouching his face, a strange feeling rose in Nian Bing's heart. A good person? Was he really a good person? Not long ago, Xue Jing had even called him a dead man.\n\nAnother half a month passed. On the fourth floor of the Ice Moon Empire's Magician Guild, Nian Bing was carefully reciting a magic spell book. Long Zhi indeed had high hopes for Nian Bing. Twenty days ago, after he finished learning the knowledge on the third floor, Long Zhi permitted him to enter the fourth floor to continue studying. The fourth floor had far fewer books than the third; there wasn't even a single bookshelf fully stocked. The magic knowledge here was extremely profound, and even with Nian Bing's intelligence, he could only memorize it to slowly understand later.\n\nOn the fourth floor, there were various incantations of all elements, including eleventh-tier forbidden magic spells. Although extremely few in number, these spells were the guild's most precious assets. Ordinary magic was divided into ten tiers. Upon reaching the eleventh tier, it was what was called a forbidden spell. And the highest, twelfth-tier magic, the God Descent Art, was even called the forbidden among the forbidden.\n\n\"Nian Bing.\" Long Zhi opened the barrier and walked up from below, interrupting Nian Bing who was reciting.\n\n\"Master, didn't you say I only needed to recite these things now? No more explanations needed?\" Nian Bing looked at Long Zhi with some surprise. When he first became Long Zhi's disciple, he still harbored some reservations in his heart, but Long Zhi's selfless teaching made him feel as if he saw Cha Ji's figure again, and his defenses had gradually faded long ago.\n\nLong Zhi's expression was a little grim. He said to Nian Bing, \"You must leave tomorrow. I just received news that His Majesty the King, after hearing about you, is very interested in your cooking skills and has already sent a message to Marquis Nuo Ya using a Magic Wind Pigeon. Magic Wind Pigeons are very fast; they will definitely reach Ice Snow City within three days. Therefore, you must leave tomorrow.\"\n\nNian Bing had always wanted to leave Ice Snow City, but suddenly hearing Long Zhi tell him to leave, he couldn't help but feel somewhat unaccustomed. However, he still nodded and said, \"Master, I've almost finished memorizing the things here. If I hurry, I should be able to finish by tonight. Anyway, I don't have much to pack, so I'll leave first thing tomorrow morning. I haven't appeared outside these past few days, so I suppose the people from Dacheng Pavilion shouldn't know I'm still in the city, right?\"\n\nLong Zhi snorted coldly and said, \"If you think that, you're underestimating them too much. I already found out that there are people monitoring around the guild, as if fearing you'd run away. Your existence is always a threat to Dacheng Pavilion.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"I understand, Master. Is there anything else you want to instruct me to do?\"\n\nLong Zhi didn't speak. He walked to the only bookshelf, hesitated for a moment, then took out a magic book from the top shelf. Nian Bing had already read that book; it described the effects of some forbidden-tier magic. While reading it, Nian Bing was genuinely startled by the immense power of the forbidden spells.\n\nLong Zhi held the book and said, \"Originally, I didn't want to teach you this magic, nor did I hope you'd ever need to use it. However, I now feel it's better to teach it to you. Although its danger is extremely great, it is the best way to save your life.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Long Zhi with some doubt and asked, \"Master, what kind of magic makes you so hesitant?\"\n\nGreen light emerged from Long Zhi's finger. Active wind elements danced in the air. The green light was guided by his finger, drawing a strange pattern on the surface of the magic book. Nian Bing, who was familiar with magic arrays, immediately understood that it was a simple array to activate a hidden effect.\n\nWith a flash of light, the magic book seemed unchanged. Long Zhi opened the book. The original first page disappeared, revealing a layer of small golden characters. He said, \"Memorize this incantation, but absolutely do not utter it aloud. Make sure to remember every single word clearly.\"\n\nThe incantation was very long. Nian Bing didn't pay attention to its content, but instead, as Long Zhi instructed, imprinted it deep into his mind. After he had completely memorized it, he looked up and asked, \"Master, what is this incantation?\"\n\nA glimmer shone in Long Zhi's eyes. He said, \"This is an ancient curse incantation, and also the greatest secret of our guild.\"\n\nNian Bing's body trembled. He said, \"A curse incantation? Don't only dark-elemental mages possess those? According to records, dark magic seems to have been lost long ago.\"\n\nLong Zhi shook his head. He said, \"No, dark magic actually still exists. It's just that dark mages have always been hunted by all factions across the continent, so they hide very secretly, and their numbers are also extremely scarce. In fact, dark magic is a very mystical magic, possessing special effects that other elemental magic cannot achieve. But I can tell you, this curse magic does not belong to the realm of dark magic; it is an ancient, special curse magic. Its existence was originally known only to me. Now, you are the second.\"\n\nNian Bing asked curiously, \"Then what exactly are its effects?\"\n\nLong Zhi said, \"The effect is very simple: it's a self-curse.\"\n\n\"Curse oneself?\" Even with Nian Bing's intelligence, he couldn't understand Long Zhi's words.\n\n\"Precisely, to curse oneself. By cursing one's own life, one obtains more powerful strength. It's a special curse magic that allows one to use magic beyond their limits in an instant. The use of this curse can be controlled; the strength obtained varies according to the intensity of the self-curse. Its name is the Song of Life's Curse.\"\n\nA brilliant light shone in Nian Bing's eyes. \"Master, I want to know to what extent this magic's greatest power can reach.\"\n\nLong Zhi glanced at Nian Bing and said, \"A terrifying extent. Eleventh-tier forbidden spells and twelfth-tier God Descent Art have entirely different powers. Back then, the Priestess of the Ice Snow Goddess once destroyed Langmu Empire's one hundred thousand strong army with a single God Descent Art, and it was precisely because of that battle that she gained her current status. If I were to use this curse to fully unleash my life and then use a forbidden spell, although it might not achieve that exact effect, confronting the Priestess of the Ice Snow Goddess for an hour would be absolutely no problem. This is the power of the curse. You must remember, do not use this curse unless it is a matter of life or death, because each time it's used, it will cost you at least five years of life force. Do you understand?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Master, I understand. It's for desperate situations.\"\n\nLong Zhi nodded and said, \"It's good that you understand. Also, there's one more thing: it's September now. Next year, on July 7th, the New Talent Magicians' Convention will be held in the Huayong Imperial Capital. I hope you can represent the guild and participate. At that time, you'll just need to show the participant badge. Each empire can send two new talent magicians, required to be under twenty-five years old, with no other restrictions. Of the two sent by the Ice Moon Empire, one is selected from the Ice God Tower, and the other is selected from our guild. Every time, the people our guild sends are just props, so I hope you can bring honor to your master. Of course, you don't have to agree; after all, this isn't within the scope of our original agreement. I've given you the participant badge; whether you go or not is up to you.\" As he spoke, he took out a dark, dull badge from his bosom and handed it to Nian Bing. The badge had a distinct magical aura, and the complex magic array on it was something even Nian Bing couldn't discern its properties. There was a number on the badge: ten.\n\n\"Do you see? The number is ten. This means our ranking in the previous competition was tenth.\" A hint of sorrow entered Long Zhi's voice.\n\nNian Bing put the badge into his Spatial Ring, smiled faintly, and said, \"Master, if it's on my way, I think I will go.\"\n\nLong Zhi handed a scroll to Nian Bing. \"You brat, you just won't give me a definite answer. This Spatial Scroll can take you directly from here to the alley not far from Clear Wind Hall's back door. I'd like to see how Dacheng Pavilion can keep an eye on you. As for when to leave, you decide. Don't say goodbye to me. I don't like that feeling. I'll tell Ling'er for you. Finally, I'll remind you one more time: don't forget what you once promised me. How much you achieve in the future will depend on yourself.\"\n\nLong Zhi left. Nian Bing put the scroll into his Spatial Ring. Was he finally leaving? This was what he had always hoped for, but was there truly no lingering attachment at all?\n\nIn the early morning, as the first ray of sunlight brought brilliance to Ice Snow City, a gray figure quietly appeared in the alley not far from Clear Wind Hall. Looking around, Nian Bing put on the worn felt hat he had brought from the Magician Guild. With his coarse cloth clothes, unless it was someone familiar, probably no one would be able to recognize him.\n\nLooking around, Nian Bing was just about to leave to find Feng Nü. Suddenly, he heard a crisp sound, and at the same time, strong magic fluctuations came from around the corner not far ahead in the alley. Driven by curiosity, Nian Bing walked towards the corner. Immediately, he witnessed a bizarre scene.\n\nIt was a little girl, appearing to be only fourteen or fifteen years old. She wasn't tall, only reaching Nian Bing's chest, with a delicate and petite figure. Although her clothes were somewhat torn, it was clear they were originally made from very luxurious fabric. She had two long, thick black braids and was murmuring something with her back to Nian Bing.\n\n\"By my name Xi Yun, I summon you forth, my pet, Dandan.\" With a small, pitch-black magic staff in her hand, she pointed at the ground. Immediately, a red hexagram pattern appeared on the ground. The hexagram's light wasn't very bright. Most strangely, although it was red, it didn't emit any scorching aura. The magic elements in the air seemed to be repelled and scattered around it.\n\nJust as Nian Bing wondered what she was doing, suddenly, the dark red light abruptly expanded. A scene that nearly made Nian Bing cry out in surprise occurred: a massive figure appeared on that dark red hexagram. With a \"Moo,\" the figure gradually became clear. Its body had black and white fur; it was actually a dairy cow.\n\nThe dark red hexagram disappeared. The dairy cow rubbed against the girl, seemingly very affectionate. Although the cow's body wasn't very tall, it was extremely plump; with just a slight movement, the fat on its body would constantly jiggle.\n\n\"Good cow, I'm so hungry, I can barely walk. Can you squeeze some milk for me to drink? I'm starving.\" The girl patted the dairy cow's head, pleading somewhat.\n\nThe dairy cow let out a low, dissatisfied growl, apparently unwilling to contribute its milk.\n\nAt this moment, Nian Bing felt a jolt of tension in his heart. What had he just seen? Although it was a dairy cow, this was clearly Summoning Art, a special magic listed alongside his Ice-Fire Dual Source as a legend! Could it be that this little girl was a Summoning Mage? Heavens! Summoning Mages actually existed.",

    "content": "Nian Bing had read in the Mages' Guild's records that Summoning Magic was known as the most mysterious magic on the continent, its mystique even surpassing Dark Magic. The requirements for practicing Summoning Magic were very strange, and few could meet them. The basic requirement was that the practitioner of Summoning Magic must be a naturally born \"blank slate.\" A \"blank slate\" referred to someone whose body possessed no elemental attributes at birth. While dual attributes were rare, one or two such individuals could still be found among every thousand people. However, a \"blank slate\" with no attributes whatsoever was one in ten thousand.\n\nAccording to the records, thousands of years ago, the level of magic was far more developed than it was now, and mages were the mainstream profession. Humans would choose to cultivate magic of the same element as their inherent attributes. If you were a \"blank slate\" back then, you would certainly be dubbed a good-for-nothing. At that time, among the rare \"blank slates,\" one individual, unable to bear the external pressure, chose to commit suicide. However, during the suicide, a strange event occurred. No one knew exactly what happened, but several years later, the first Summoning Mage appeared on the continent.\n\nAlthough \"blank slates\" could not cultivate magic because they lacked any attributes, they were born with powerful mental energy. Summoning Magic involved using this mental energy to summon various creatures with whom one had formed a contract. These creatures, ranging from small birds and beasts to mighty dragons, could become partners for a Summoning Mage. The stronger one's mental energy, the more powerful the creature one could summon to fight for them. Undoubtedly, the most important thing for a Summoning Mage was to enhance their mental energy, but luck was also very important. As Summoning Mages had no inherent abilities of their own, due to their innate talent, they couldn't even cultivate martial arts. How easy could it be to sign a contract with a powerful creature? Therefore, luck was equally important for Summoning Mages. To be able to summon more powerful mages¹, these Summoning Mages, originating from \"blank slates,\" developed a special type of magic suited for themselves: Mental Magic, cultivated through powerful mental energy. For ordinary people, this was almost impossible, but for them, it was not difficult.\n\nFor some unknown reason, the legendary Summoning Mages disappeared from the continental stage due to the scarcity of \"blank slates.\" And thus, the Dragon Summoner, the strongest among the legendary Summoning Mages, also ceased to exist. Nian Bing had never imagined that before leaving Ice Snow City, he would actually encounter a Summoning Mage. Although she had only summoned a cow, the fact of the summoning was right there. Thinking of this, due to the surprise in his heart, Nian Bing's mental energy couldn't help but fluctuate violently.\n\n\"Moo.\" The cow cautiously raised its head and looked towards Nian Bing. The young girl also turned around at the same time, following the cow's gaze. Only then did Nian Bing clearly see her appearance: her fair skin was as translucent as white jade, and on her beautiful, delicate face were a pair of large black eyes, the same color as her hair. Her eyes were truly very large, radiating an approachable spiritual aura. Her small red lips were slightly pouted. She blinked her eyes, a little surprised, \"Who's there?\"\n\nNian Bing stepped out from the shadows and said somewhat awkwardly, \"Hello, little sister.\"\n\nThe girl stuck out her tongue. \"Hmph, don't call me little sister! In eleven more months, I'll be sixteen. What are you doing there? Are you purposefully following me? No wonder Papa says people from the outside world aren't any good! Why are you following me?\"\n\nNian Bing quickly shook his head. \"No. Don't misunderstand, I wasn't following you. It's just that I happened to be passing by, felt a magical fluctuation, and came over to take a look, little si... oh, no, young lady, are you a Summoning Mage?\"\n\nThe girl paused for a moment and said, \"You figured it out? Papa said that anyone who recognizes our identity must die.\"\n\nNian Bing was startled. \"What? Why is that?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head and giggled, \"But don't be scared, even if I wanted to kill you, it wouldn't be that easy, because I don't have any pets that attack people. Big brother, do you have anything to eat? I'm so hungry.\"\n\nNian Bing helplessly shook his head. \"I came out in a hurry, so I didn't bring any food with me. But I can go buy you some. Aren't there many shops selling food on the streets outside? Why don't you buy some?\"\n\nThe girl pouted. \"I... I snuck out, and I didn't bring any money. These past few days, I've only been able to keep from starving by drinking Dandan's milk. Big brother, can you buy me something to eat? I'll trade you Dandan's milk.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at the plump cow. \"It's called Dandan?\"\n\nA strange light suddenly flashed in the girl's eyes. \"Dandan, aren't you going to bow to this big brother?\"\n\nDandan mooed, and its two front hooves suddenly lifted, raising its plump body. Nian Bing clearly saw eight fat, reddish teats under its belly, looking like they could produce quite a lot. Just then, an anomaly suddenly occurred. The cow named Dandan's eight teats simultaneously shot out milky white beams of light, striking Nian Bing like lightning.\n\nNian Bing was not a warrior; even with his quick reactions, there was no way to dodge in this narrow alley. The Touch Magic Scroll played a crucial role at this moment. A blue light suddenly flared, and a thick ice wall abruptly appeared before Nian Bing. The ice wall, nearly one *liao* thick, surprisingly developed eight deep pits under the attack of those light beams. Nian Bing was dumbfounded to discover that the eight white beams were actually eight streams of milk shot out from the teats. He had no doubt that without protection, these eight streams of milk could easily penetrate his body.\n\nWith a slight wave of his right hand, the Flame God Stone appeared from his Spatial Ring. Nian Bing carefully chanted a spell, vigilantly watching the young girl before him.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing block the cow's attack, the girl couldn't help but look at him in surprise. \"Are you a mage too?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Of course. Otherwise, how could I have sensed your magic fluctuations earlier?\"\n\nThe girl pouted. \"Well, there's no choice then. I have to kill you. Otherwise, if Papa finds out I revealed my magic secret, he'll never let me out again. I'm sorry, big brother.\" Her pretty face radiated a sunny smile, making it hard for Nian Bing to associate her with the words \"kill\" or \"murder.\" But at that moment, he dared not be careless in the slightest; this girl in front of him, capable of using summoning magic, was certainly not simple.\n\nSubconsciously, Nian Bing took a step back. The cow named Dandan had already slowly walked to the girl's side. Its bovine eyes looked at Nian Bing, seemingly with a hint of disdain. It mooed, and its two front hooves lifted again. Another eight streams of milk shot towards Nian Bing, only this time, they were much faster and stronger.\n\nNian Bing's right hand, holding the Flame God Stone, slowly extended forward. A cluster of purple flames suddenly condensed into a fire shield that appeared before him. This was a Tier 4 spell called Purple Flame Shield, the magic he had prepared earlier. Its purpose was to generate high temperatures for defending against ice-element magic, and at this moment, it was clearly perfect for dealing with milk. Although the milk's impact force was strong, it was immediately evaporated into a milky mist upon touching the Purple Flame Shield. Instantly, a faint scent of milk wafted through the air. The Purple Flame Shield showed no damage at all, apart from emitting a few scorching currents of air.\n\nRelying on his magic control, which far surpassed mages of the same rank, Nian Bing controlled the Purple Flame Shield with his right hand and took a step forward, looking at the plump cow. \"Do you have no other skills besides milking? As a magic beast like this, I really don't know how you survive. What if you run out of milk?\" Although the cow in front of him was no different from an ordinary cow, the fact that it could initiate an attack showed that it still belonged to the magic beast category, albeit with very limited abilities, seemingly only capable of that milk attack.\n\nThe cow looked at the Purple Flame Shield in front of Nian Bing, clearly a little fearful. It turned its head to its owner and mooed several times.\n\nThe girl poked her head out from behind the cow and looked at Nian Bing in surprise. \"Big brother, why aren't you dead yet! First it was ice, now it's fire, why have I never heard Papa talk about mages like that?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart was slightly startled; only then did he realize he had accidentally revealed a secret. He calmly said, \"That was a magic scroll just now; this is my magic. Young lady, if you don't want this cow to turn into beef, you'd better make it get out of the way.\"\n\nThe girl said, seemingly troubled, \"But my cow-cow can kill people! If I send it back to my spatial dimension, how will I kill you then?\" Her appearance was extremely adorable, without a trace of pretense.\n\nNian Bing asked with amusement, \"Then have you ever killed anyone?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head. \"Nope, but Papa always talks about killing people, and Mama always quarrels with him about it. It's so boring, so I just had to run out and play a bit.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at the unworldly girl before him, and a wave of emotion suddenly rose in his heart. It wasn't love between a man and a woman, but the affection of an elder brother for his younger sister. \"How about this: you send this fat cow back to your so-called spatial dimension, and I'll treat you to something good to eat, alright?\"\n\nThe girl tilted her head and thought for a moment. \"Okay! Then I'll kill you after I finish eating. Papa is very fierce, and I can't help it. Big brother, you won't blame me, right?\"\n\nNian Bing casually dispelled the Purple Flame Shield and said, \"Come with me.\" As he spoke, he pressed down on the hat on his head and walked out of the alley. He still had quite a few Touch Magic Scrolls on him, so he wasn't afraid of the girl ambushing him.\n\nThe girl cheered excitedly, clasped her hands together in front of her chest, and murmured, \"Dandan, withdraw.\" With a flash of red light, the massive cow instantly vanished, leaving behind its low moo as it disappeared.\n\nThe girl followed behind Nian Bing. The two of them, one in front and one behind, arrived on the main street. Nian Bing lowered his head, listening to the girl's footsteps, and slowly walked towards the north of the city. If it weren't for needing to leave Ice Snow City, he could have very well treated this girl to a feast at Qingfeng Zhai. But now, he couldn't; that street in the city, he avoided it like the plague.\n\nAfter walking for about half an hour, the girl finally couldn't stand the boredom anymore. She sped up and ran to Nian Bing's side. \"Big brother, my tummy is so hungry, and my legs are so soft, I can't walk anymore. When will there be good food?\"\n\nNian Bing turned his head to look at the girl, who was a full head shorter than him. \"Don't rush, we'll be there soon. When we arrive, big brother will personally make delicious food for you to eat.\" For some reason, whenever he saw the girl's innocent and flawless big black eyes, a feeling of tenderness would unconsciously rise in Nian Bing's heart.\n\nThe girl blinked her eyes. \"Big brother, can you carry me on your back, please? I really can't walk anymore.\"\n\nNian Bing was startled. His actual age was only three years older than this girl. Hearing her voluntarily ask him to carry her on his back, he couldn't help but blush. \"How can that be? There's a difference between men and women.\"\n\nThe girl pouted her small lips. \"You're lying! Papa used to always carry me everywhere on his back, didn't he?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled wryly. \"That's different. He's your Papa!\"\n\nThe girl said, \"If you don't carry me, I'll find a deserted place and summon Dandan to ride on it.\"\n\nNian Bing quickly shook his head. \"No, that won't do. Riding a cow down the street will attract attention.\" His current goal was to quietly leave Ice Snow City. Frankly, he didn't even understand why he was taking along such a burden.\n\nThe girl stretched out her arms, her fair little hands as tender as spring bamboo shoots. \"Then carry me.\"\n\nSighing, Nian Bing helplessly crouched down. She was just a little girl, after all. The girl cheered gleefully, then with a sudden leap, she climbed onto Nian Bing's broad back. Although Nian Bing wasn't trained in martial arts, from the perspective of an ordinary person, his body was still quite robust. The girl's body was very light, and carrying her wasn't very strenuous. Thus, he carried the girl, traversing streets and alleys, advancing towards his destination.\n\nAfter about a meal's worth of time, Nian Bing, somewhat breathless, let the girl get down from his back. Sweat had already beaded on his forehead and temples. \"Get down, little ancestor, we're here.\"\n\n\"Shuihuo Ironworks, big brother, is there good food here?\" the girl asked curiously.\n\nNian Bing didn't answer. He walked to the door and knocked a few times.\n\n\"Who is it!\" A familiar voice softly rang out. Nian Bing suddenly felt a warmth in his heart. For some reason, Feng Nü's appearance had always been the most deeply etched in his mind.\n\n\"Feng Nü, it's me, Nian Bing.\"\n\nThe door opened, and Feng Nü, dressed in white pants and a white top, peeked out from behind it. Looking at Nian Bing, her expression seemed a little cold. \"Oh, what an honor. For you to grace our humble abode, aren't you demeaning yourself?\"\n\n---\n¹ The original text here says \"更強大的魔法師\" (more powerful mages), which is unusual in the context of summoning creatures.

    "content": "Nianbing looked at Feng Nü. She seemed even more beautiful, especially the noble aura that subtly emanated from her seemed richer than before. \"Feng Nü, you, I...\" For a moment, he truly didn't know what to say.\n\n\"Hello, elder sister, I'm so hungry.\" The young girl poked her head out from behind Nianbing, her large eyes looking at Feng Nü with a curious expression.\n\nFeng Nü saw the adorable young girl and couldn't help but glance at Nianbing in surprise. \"She is?\"\n\nNianbing gave a wry smile, \"I just picked her up from the street. According to her, she ran away from home and didn't bring any money.\"\n\nFeng Nü looked at Nianbing suspiciously a few times, her expression* clearly holding a hint of displeasure. She opened the door and said, \"You two come in first.\"\n\n\"There better be good food!\" The young girl cheered and was the first to rush through the door. As Nianbing passed Feng Nü, he clearly heard her whisper, \"If I find out you're abducting underage girls, don't blame me for being impolite to you.\"\n\nNianbing said with an innocent look, \"Do you think I'm that kind of person?\"\n\nFeng Nü snorted and said, \"You know a person's face, but not their heart**. Who knows if you have such a hobby.\" After saying it, she couldn't help but laugh herself. She pulled Nianbing, dragging him into the courtyard, her beautiful eyes sparkling, ineffably moving.\n\n\"Elder sister, what good food do you have here! I'm so hungry!\" The young girl ran to Feng Nü's side, unreservedly grabbing her hand and shaking it.\n\nFeng Nü softly said, \"Little sister, what's your name? Why are you running away from home? That's not good. Your family will worry.\"\n\nNianbing nodded and said, \"Exactly, you're too mischievous. I don't even know your name. Oh, right, why can't I call you little sister, but she can?\"\n\nThe young girl blinked and said, \"Because elder sister is prettier than you! My name is Xiyun, actually, I'm very well-behaved, as well-behaved as an adorable little cat, so Daddy and Mummy both like to call me Maomao. You can call me that too.\"\n\nFeng Nü shot Nianbing a glare and said, \"Maomao, don't mind him. Nianbing, hurry up and make dinner. There are ready-made ingredients in the kitchen. Hmph, these past few days, I've had to throw away a lot of things every day, it's all your fault. I just wanted to see when you'd come.\"\n\nNianbing was stunned for a moment and said, \"I, didn't I tell you that I might not be able to come over during this period?\"\n\nFeng Nü said ill-humoredly, \"Hurry up and make dinner, I'll settle accounts with you later. Little sister, you sit down and rest for a bit first.\" As she spoke, she pulled over a stool for Maomao to sit on.\n\nNianbing shook his head helplessly and could only walk towards the kitchen. As of now, besides the \"deceased\" Chaji, only Feng Nü in front of him could use a commanding tone to make him willingly cook.\n\nThere weren't many ingredients in the kitchen, just a few kinds of green vegetables. After Nianbing's careful preparation, in less than half an hour, four dishes and one soup were fragrant and laid out on the table in the courtyard.\n\n\"Wow, it smells so good! Elder brother, why is this rice green?\" Maomao asked, looking at the fragrant rice in her hand.\n\nNianbing smiled and said, \"Because elder brother made it with the juice from boiled vegetables. The nutrients from the vegetables will fully integrate into the rice during steaming. Not only does it add a bit of freshness to the taste, but it's also very nutritious. Eat more. It's a pity they're all just green vegetables. Otherwise, if you offered up your fat cow, I could make you some beef meatballs to eat?\"\n\nMaomao was clearly startled by Nianbing. \"No! Cow-cow can't be eaten! Cow-cow still needs to be milked for Maomao to drink.\"\n\nFeng Nü looked at them in confusion and asked, \"Cow? Where did the cow come from?\"\n\nMaomao's eyes widened as she looked at Nianbing. \"Don't tell! Elder sister, Maomao can't tell you this, otherwise you'll die.\"\n\nHearing her say that, Feng Nü's confusion deepened. \"Then why*** does Nianbing know?\"\n\nMaomao, while eating the dishes in big mouthfuls, mumbled, \"Because after I finish eating, I'll kill elder brother! Who told him to know my secret.\"\n\nFeng Nü looked at Nianbing in shock. \"She wants to kill you?\"\n\nNianbing shrugged and said, \"She's not deep in the world****. Who told me to know her secret? Let her kill me then. Anyway, after I finish eating, I'll be leaving here. Perhaps I'll never see her again.\"\n\nFeng Nü's expression changed slightly. \"Are you leaving?\"\n\nNianbing nodded and said, \"I have to go. You know about the matter. I received news that the Ice Moon Empire's king has already ordered me to be summoned to the palace. If I don't leave soon, I'm afraid I won't even have freedom anymore. Feng Nü, is the Pure Yang Blade***** ready?\"\n\nFeng Nü's eyes flickered with a strange light. After a long moment, she nodded and said, \"It was ready a few days ago. You should leave too. Perhaps, after you leave, I will also depart from here.\"\n\nNianbing said in surprise, \"You're leaving too?\"\n\nFeng Nü gave him a strange look and said, \"Originally, I was going to leave when you arrived. There's nothing here that makes me nostalgic. But your arrival made me stay a few more months. After dinner, I'll open the furnace. Once Pure Yang***** is completed, I'll be leaving.\"\n\nA trace of reluctance rose in Nianbing's heart. \"Then will we be able to meet again in the future? Where do you plan to go after leaving here?\"\n\nFeng Nü lowered her head, preventing Nianbing from seeing the red glow in her eyes. Maomao, however, looked up at Feng Nü, her large black eyes revealing a hint of surprise. Feng Nü said, \"Perhaps I'll go to the Langyue Empire******. There are some things there that I need to search for. If it's fated, perhaps we'll meet again.\"\n\nNianbing thought Feng Nü was looking for ore for forging. Suspecting nothing else, he said regretfully, \"It's a pity I promised a friend to go to the Oulan Empire******* first, otherwise we could have traveled together.\"\n\nThis meal proceeded in silence. The happiest one was Maomao. Although it was just green vegetables, they had a thousand flavors when made by Nianbing. The simple dishes further demonstrated his exquisite culinary skills. Maomao displayed an appetite completely disproportionate to her body, with most of the dishes ending up in her stomach. Feng Nü, who also had a considerable appetite, didn't eat much. During the meal, she occasionally looked at Nianbing, revealing a hint of hesitation, as if there was something she couldn't make up her mind about.\n\nLunch concluded with everything swept clean. Feng Nü was about to clear the table, but Nianbing stopped her. \"I haven't seen you for so many days, let me clean up.\" With that, he quickly collected the bowls and chopsticks and walked towards the kitchen.\n\nAs soon as Nianbing left, Maomao impatiently grabbed Feng Nü's hand and whispered, \"Elder sister, elder sister. Are you from the Phoenix Clan********?\"\n\nHearing this, Feng Nü's whole body trembled violently. A scorching aura naturally emanated from her. She grabbed Maomao's hand and said in a deep voice, \"How do you know? What exactly are you?\"\n\nMaomao said, a bit wronged, \"Elder sister, you're hurting Maomao. You have the aura of a phoenix! That's how Maomao knew. Before, Daddy even took me to your Phoenix Clan.\"\n\nA name popped into Feng Nü's mind. She lowered her voice and said, \"Are you the daughter of Shilade, the Dragon Summoner?\"\n\nMaomao said, \"Yes! Yes! Elder sister, do you know my Daddy too?\"\n\nFeng Nü's eyes flickered continuously, but the expression on her face********* softened again. \"I know him, of course I know him. Shilade, the most talented genius summoner among white people**********, how could I not know him? The last time you went to the Phoenix Clan was probably ten years ago. Your father once helped us a lot. He truly is a genius; to cultivate summoning magic to that extent is simply unbelievable. It's a pity that his summoning magic leans too much towards darkness. However, looking at you, it seems you haven't been influenced by him. Maomao, did you just say you wanted to kill Nianbing because he already knows you can use summoning magic?\"\n\nMaomao nodded and said, \"It's because of that! Daddy once said that if an outsider knows I can use summoning magic, I must kill them. Otherwise, our clansmen will be attacked by bad people. Elder sister, he's a magician! He seems very hard to kill. Can you help me kill him? Daddy often says that the Phoenix Clan are born warriors, you can definitely kill him.\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled faintly and said, \"Maomao, be good. Listen to elder sister, don't kill him. He's still a good person and won't reveal your secret. If your Daddy asks about it later, just tell him that the Daughter of the Phoenix*********** guaranteed for him, and your Daddy won't blame you, okay?\"\n\nMaomao nodded and giggled, \"Okay! Maomao doesn't want to kill people either. Elder sister, thank you. It's really good not to have to kill. Elder brother Nianbing's food is so delicious, I'd really be a bit reluctant to kill him.\"\n\nFeng Nü said ill-humoredly, \"This girl, she only half-learned summoning magic before running away from home. If you want to kill him, you'd need to study properly with your Daddy for at least five more years. He's not simple; his Ice-Fire Co-Origin Magic************ is just as wondrous as your family's summoning magic. Maomao, remember, in front of him, absolutely do not reveal elder sister's identity.\"\n\nMaomao blinked and said, \"Elder sister, don't worry. Maomao is the most well-behaved, I won't reveal it.\"\n\nWell-behaved? If you're well-behaved, why would you run away from home? \"Maomao, after I help your elder brother Nianbing with something, I'll send you back. You running away by yourself must have worried your Daddy and Mummy sick.\"\n\nMaomao pouted and said, \"No way! Home is super boring. Daddy makes me stay in different crystal balls every day, saying it's for practicing spiritual power or something, but it's so boring, not fun at all. I finally managed to run out, Maomao wants to play for a few more days before anything else.\"\n\nFeng Nü frowned and said, \"But your Daddy will worry! Do you want them to be anxious? Maomao, be obedient, otherwise, elder sister might have to tie you up and take you back.\" Given the relationship between the Phoenix Clan and Maomao's father, Feng Nü definitely had to help with this.\n\nMaomao lowered her head and said, \"Alright then, I'll go back with elder sister.\"\n\nJust then, Nianbing had finished cleaning up and walked out of the kitchen. He smiled and said, \"I made quite a lot of food today, I didn't expect you to eat it all. Maomao, you shouldn't be called Maomao, you should be called Piggy.\"\n\nMaomao's eyes suddenly lit up. \"Oh, right, elder sister, do you have any more food here? Maomao's pets haven't eaten anything yet, they must be hungry too. Only Pale Milk Cow************* is the best, it's fine with eating just about anything, but the other ones aren't well-behaved, they're very picky eaters.\"\n\nNianbing said in surprise, \"Maomao, why did you tell your...\"\n\nMaomao smiled and said, \"Because elder sister is a good person! I already told elder sister!\"\n\nNianbing looked at Feng Nü strangely. He really didn't understand how, in such a short time, Feng Nü had already won over Maomao. It seemed his own charm was indeed far inferior to Feng Nü's. \"Maomao, do your pets still need to eat?\"\n\nMaomao said, \"Of course they need to eat. Usually, they're in my space, but after a while, they have to eat something. Sometimes, when there's really no food, I can only let them drink a bit of pale milk**************. Since leaving home, they haven't been full even once.\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled faintly and said, \"Then call them all out. Although elder sister doesn't have meat here, there's plenty of grain.\"\n\nMaomao said excitedly, \"Okay! Finally, they can get some fresh air. If they're still picky about grain, I'll starve them. Elder brother, elder sister, let me show you my Four Great Summoned Beasts***************. In my name, Xiyun, I summon you, come forth, my pet, Tiantian!\" A red hexagram appeared on the ground. Nianbing clearly felt a spiritual power, even stronger than his own, filling the space. With a flash of red light, a creature immediately appeared on the ground. It was actually a plump mouse.\n\nThe large mouse was half a meter long. If judged by proportion, it was even fatter than that milk cow. Besides its pointed snout and thin tail, its entire body was like a grey ball. As soon as it appeared, its pointed nose constantly sniffed at something. When its nose pointed towards Feng Nü, it suddenly trembled all over and lay on the ground, not daring to move.\n\nLooking at this fat mouse, Nianbing, as a chef, secretly thought, \"If I roast it and let all the fat from its body seep into the skin, the taste would definitely be excellent. Just a bit of salt would be enough.\"\n\nMaomao said, \"Big Old Mouse**************** is the laziest of all my pets. All day it just sleeps and eats, eats and sleeps. Making it work is the hardest. In my name, Xiyun, I summon you, come forth, my pet, Nana!\" Red light flickered again. What appeared this time was actually a fiery-red fox. The fox appeared next to the big mouse, Tiantian, looking somewhat slender and delicate. It blinked its not-so-large but very agile eyes, groomed its luxurious fur, and seemed to wear a strange and wicked smile as it directly climbed onto the big mouse's back. Tiantian protested twice with dissatisfied squeaks, but probably due to oppressive power, it had no choice but to lower its head again. The fox surveyed its surroundings, and just as it was about to act arrogantly, it suddenly sensed the special aura emanating from Feng Nü. It immediately, very wisely, covered its head with its tail, completely playing the ostrich.\n\n---\n* The original Chinese text uses \"神包间\" (shén bāo jiān) here, which literally means \"god's private room.\" However, given the context of a person's expression changing, it is almost certainly a typographical error for \"神色间\" (shén sè jiān), meaning \"in her expression/demeanor.\"\n** Literally: \"You know a person's face, but not their heart.\" This is a common idiom meaning one can know someone's appearance but not their true nature or thoughts.\n*** The original Chinese text uses \"為直麼\" (wèi zhí me), which appears to be a typographical error for \"為什麼\" (wèi shén me), meaning \"why.\"\n**** Literally: \"not deep in worldly affairs.\" This implies innocence or lack of experience in society/life.\n***** \"正陽刀\" (Zhèng Yáng Dāo) is translated as \"Pure Yang Blade.\" \"正陽\" (Zhèng Yáng) means \"pure yang\" or \"correct yang.\" \"正陽\" is used again later to refer to the completed blade.\n****** \"朗月帝國\" (Lǎng Yuè Dì Guó) is translated as \"Langyue Empire.\"\n******* \"奧蘭帝國\" (Ào Lán Dì Guó) is translated as \"Oulan Empire.\"\n******** \"鳳族\" (Fèng Zú) is translated as \"Phoenix Clan\" or \"Phoenix Tribe.\"\n********* The original Chinese text uses \"神包\" (shén bāo) here, which literally means \"god's private room\" or \"divine package.\" Given the context of a person's face/expression, it is almost certainly a typographical error for \"神色\" (shén sè), meaning \"expression.\"\n********** \"白人\" (bái rén) literally translates to \"white people.\" In a fantasy context, this might refer to a specific race of humans.\n*********** \"鳳凰之女\" (Fèng Huáng Zhī Nǚ) is translated as \"Daughter of the Phoenix.\"\n************ \"冰火同源魔法\" (Bīng Huǒ Tóng Yuán Mó Fǎ) is translated as \"Ice-Fire Co-Origin Magic,\" referring to magic that combines ice and fire from the same source.\n************* \"淡淡奶牛\" (dàn dàn nǎi niú) literally translates to \"pale milk cow.\" This is likely the name or a descriptive term for Maomao's pet cow, which she previously referred to as \"牛牛\" (Cow-cow).\n************** \"淡淡的牛奶\" (dàn dàn de niú nǎi) literally translates to \"pale milk\" or \"light milk,\" implying diluted or plain milk rather than rich milk.\n*************** \"四大召喚獸\" (Sì Dà Zhào Huàn Shòu) is translated as \"Four Great Summoned Beasts.\"\n**************** The original Chinese text uses \"大老姒\" (dà lǎo sì) here.

    "content": "Catcat giggled and said, \"Nana is the most cunning. She's always bullying the other darlings, especially Tiantian. By my name Xiyun, I summon you! Come forth, my pet, Guanguan.\" Red light flickered in Catcat's hand this time. With a flash of light, a little pig appeared in Catcat's arms. The pig was entirely pale pink, and as soon as it appeared, it wiggled its plump little butt in Catcat's embrace. Its body was even shorter than the big rat Tiantian, only thirty centimeters long.\n\nNian Bing saw this cute pink pig and couldn't help but blurt out in praise, \"What excellent material for a roasted suckling pig!\"\n\nAs soon as the words left his mouth, he immediately met an angry gaze. Catcat glared at Nian Bing. \"Brother, what are you saying? You're not allowed to have any designs on Guanguan. It's so cute, you, you actually want to roast it and eat it!\"\n\nNian Bing said awkwardly, \"Sorry, Catcat, it's just my professional habit.\"\n\nCatcat snorted, saying, \"Guanguan is the cutest. When it was born, it was very clean and adorable, and its big ears could occasionally stand up, like a clean little 'pig officer' – that's why I call it Guanguan. Guanguan, don't be scared, Big Sister will protect you, no one will harm you.\" The pink pig kept burrowing into Catcat's arms, only showing its plump butt wiggling outside. After hearing Catcat's words, its courage seemed to grow a little. It poked its head out from Catcat's arms to look out. When its tiny eyes saw Feng Nü, surprisingly, there was no fear. It even seemed a little excited, and a dark red light flashed in its small eyes.\n\nA hint of surprise gleamed in Feng Nü's eyes. She said, \"Catcat, where did all these pets of yours come from?\"\n\nCatcat giggled, \"Of course, Daddy bred them! But, they don't seem to be fully developed yet. I was afraid of being lonely on the road by myself, so I brought them all out. Anyway, they also have a contract with me. By my name Xiyun, I summon you! Come forth, my pet, Dandan.\" As Catcat's last summoned pet, the enormous body of the cow appeared, instantly dwarfing the other three pets. It mooed twice and came to Catcat's side.\n\nHearing the cow's mooing, the fox Nana, who had been lying on the big rat Tiantian's back, suddenly raised its head. A glint of lewdness shone in its small eyes. With a sudden leap, its fiery red figure immediately hung from the cow's belly. Looking closely, it was actually latched onto one of the cow's teats, sucking greedily.\n\nCatcat said discontentedly, \"Nana, you're the naughtiest one.\"\n\nA pig, a cow, plus a fox and a big rat, formed Catcat's four great summoned beasts. Although on the surface, these pets seemed ordinary, Nian Bing vaguely sensed that these summoned beasts were not simple.\n\nFeng Nü fetched a bag of rice from the kitchen. She scattered the rice on the ground. The gray big rat and the pink little pig Guanguan pounced almost simultaneously, burying themselves in the pile of rice and not coming out.\n\nThe cow was roaring furiously, trying to shake the fox off, but by now the fox had latched tightly onto its underbelly. No matter how hard it tried, it couldn't stop its milk from continuously flowing into the fox's belly.\n\nCatcat comforted it, \"Dandan. Be a good darling. There's nothing here for Nana to eat, so let it drink some of your milk. Do you want some rice too?\"\n\nIn Dandan's enormous cow eyes was a look of complete innocence. Nian Bing had no doubt that if the fox were on the ground now, it would immediately stomp the fox to death.\n\n\"Nian Bing, let's begin.\" Feng Nü's calm voice suddenly sounded in Nian Bing's ear. Nian Bing looked at her, and Feng Nü was also looking at him. A feeling of parting sorrow spread through Nian Bing's chest. He nodded, saying, \"Then I'll trouble you.\"\n\nFeng Nü drifted up, and with a flash, arrived beside the forging furnace in the corner by the wall. Her dark red Nine-Separation Dou Qi<sup>1</sup> highlighted her long pink hair. With a soft cry, the seemingly extremely heavy forging furnace was actually lifted by her. With a single leap, she was already in the center of the courtyard, and put the furnace down. She glanced at Nian Bing and said, \"Wait for me.\"\n\nIn a little while, Feng Nü had already added various materials under the forging furnace, evidently for burning. Just as Feng Nü didn't understand culinary arts, Nian Bing was equally clueless about forging. He could only stand quietly by the side and wait. Catcat was playing with her pets nearby. That big rat, Tiantian, was extremely gluttonous; about eighty percent of a bag of rice went into its large maw. Although the little pink pig Guanguan ate less, it was always eating, not even raising its head.\n\nA red light flashed, a familiar aura caught Nian Bing's attention. The Zhengyang Blade had, at some point, already been placed on the forging furnace. On the hilt of the Zhengyang Blade, an openwork pattern had been carved, exactly matching the appearance of his own Three Stones of the Flame God. The edges of the carving appeared somewhat rough; evidently, the strength of this Fire Dragon Horn material was extremely difficult to damage. Feng Nü walked out, holding the Sky-Severing Sword. She nodded at Nian Bing and said, \"You can operate the bellows for me. Remember, keep your movements steady. We'll begin now.\"\n\nFeng Nü's entire body emitted a scorching aura. Fortunately, Nian Bing was on the other side of the furnace, so he wouldn't be affected by the heat radiating from her. Intense red light appeared around her body. Pointing her hand forward, a red light immediately shot into the furnace. The furnace flames surged up with a roar, but they weren't ordinary red flames. The flames were white, illuminating the entire courtyard brightly. Everything was just as it had been when he refined the Morning Dew Blade. However, this time, Feng Nü appeared much more composed than Hua Tian had been back then. It was clear that her Nine-Separation Dou Qi was superior to Hua Tian's.\n\nWith a soft cry, the Sky-Severing Sword was unsheathed. A wave of scorching fire followed the Sky-Severing Sword, striking the hilt of the Zhengyang Blade. White flames surged up from below. When they met the light of the Sky-Severing Sword, the white flames immediately turned cyan.\n\nWithout Feng Nü needing to remind him, Nian Bing immediately began to pull the bellows. The bellows moved rhythmically in his hands, keeping the white flames in a steady state. Feng Nü calmly watched the Zhengyang Blade in the furnace flames. Suddenly, she let out a soft cry, \"Nine-Separation Sky Fire!\" Omitting the process Hua Tian had used back then, drawing it out with blood, her originally red Nine-Separation Dou Qi instantly turned dark green. Amidst the dazzling light, it surged directly from the tip of the Sky-Severing Sword into the openwork on the Zhengyang Blade's hilt.\n\nNian Bing, pulling the bellows with one hand, took out the Flame God's Stone from his Spatial Ring with the other hand. He shouted to Feng Nü, \"Catch!\" With a flash of red light, the Flame God's Stone flew towards Feng Nü. A glimmer of radiance suddenly appeared in Feng Nü's sky-blue eyes. Her dark green Dou Qi instantly turned into a brilliant red light. When the Flame God's Stone touched the Dou Qi on her body, it seemed to become a part of her body, emitting a deep blue flame. An incomparably vast amount of fire elements surged forth, pouring into the furnace flames.\n\nEven though Nian Bing himself possessed the ability of a fire-elemental magician, and had been with the Flame Stone for many years, he couldn't withstand this sudden intense heat. A low-level blue ice shield blocked in front of him. He immediately stopped pulling the bellows and retreated several steps.\n\nCatcat also made her move at this point. She waved both hands repeatedly, softly chanting something under her breath. Her four precious summoned beasts disappeared one after another into a red light. Clearly, she was afraid the scorching flames would harm her summoned beasts.\n\n\"Fuse!\" Feng Nü cried out. The flame-shaped Flame God's Stone slid along the three-chi, seven-cun<sup>2</sup> long Sky-Severing Sword, accurately embedding itself into the openwork on the Zhengyang Blade. When the Flame God's Stone and the blade became one, the previously rough edges immediately became smooth. The hard Fire Dragon Horn material seemed to submit to the deep blue flames emitted by the Flame God's Stone, completely enveloping it. They merged into one, as if they were meant to be together from the start.\n\nFeng Nü's somewhat sharp gaze swept over Nian Bing. She spun the Sky-Severing Sword in her hand and made a feigned chop towards Nian Bing. Nian Bing hastily chanted a spell and raised his right arm. His purpose in chanting the spell was not defense, but to bind the trigger-activated magic scroll in his arms, preventing it from activating.\n\nThe sword light flashed. Fresh blood splattered out, but not a single drop was wasted, swept by the Nine-Separation Dou Qi to land on the Zhengyang Blade's hilt. The entire Zhengyang Blade turned brilliant red. A scorching aura shot up into the sky. The red blade light was like the brilliant sun rising into the sky, emitting a fierce roar. It seemed as if the blade was singing. Nian Bing stood rooted to the spot, his gaze firmly fixed on the Zhengyang Blade. From its broad, thick blade, he seemed to see the figure of Zhaji.\n\nFeng Nü subconsciously retreated a few steps amidst the low roar, muttering to herself, \"What immense fire elemental power! What a pity it has already recognized a master. If it weren't for this Flame God's Stone, a regular gem would absolutely not be able to be inlaid onto the Fire Dragon Horn's material. I truly didn't expect that a divine-artifact-grade precious blade would be born from my hands so quickly.\"\n\nNian Bing had forgotten everything at this moment. In his eyes, there was only the Zhengyang Blade, shimmering with intense red light. He walked step by step towards the furnace flames. The roar of the Zhengyang Blade seemed to call to his heart. Nian Bing seemed not to feel the scorching airflow around the furnace flames. He reached out his hand, actually grabbing directly for the Zhengyang Blade at the scorching center.\n\nThe roaring sound suddenly grew even stronger. Nian Bing actually just grabbed the hilt of the Zhengyang Blade directly. In an instant, a dark red light shot up into the sky. Nian Bing's internal fire magic power instantly burst forth. His body and the blade became completely one. With a soft clink, the Morning Dew Blade, originally in his Spatial Ring, appeared without any warning. The sealing magic array on it was broken open by a cyan-blue light, and its icy aura forcibly pushed the Zhengyang Blade's scorching aura to the right.\n\nNian Bing extended his left hand and grasped the Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess. The scabbard fell away. Two enormous masses of ice and fire energy constantly intertwined within his body. The originally rotating Ice-Fire Homologous Whirlpool<sup>3</sup> expanded outwards at an unparalleled speed. Nian Bing's skin surface rapidly alternated between blue and red, constantly changing colors. The ice and fire elements in the air surged towards him like moths to a flame. The blue Morning Dew and red Zhengyang formed a stark contrast.\n\nWith a soft snap, Nian Bing's clothes were the first to give way under the tearing force of the two extremely vast magical energies. Amidst Feng Nü's and Catcat's exclamations of surprise, Nian Bing's sturdy body was exposed to the air. Every inch of his skin constantly flashed with red and blue light, appearing extremely bizarre.\n\nAt this point, both Feng Nü and Catcat had turned away. Feng Nü, fearing that the aura emanating from Nian Bing would harm Catcat, tapped her toe on the ground, and, protected by dense Nine-Separation Dou Qi, appeared in front of Catcat, shielding her in her arms.\n\n\"Sister, what's wrong with Brother Nian Bing? Why is he taking off his clothes?\" Catcat asked softly, her little face flushed.\n\nFeng Nü's face was equally red, but due to the color of her Nine-Separation Dou Qi, the blush on her face wasn't obvious. She coughed once and said, \"Don't worry, your Brother Nian Bing is fine. He's a magician, and the gems on those two blades are both top-tier magic gems. The Zhengyang Blade, having just been completed, as the Flame Stone imbued its body with a soul, naturally emitted vast energy. This then activated the other ice blade, causing the magic elements to become intense, tearing his clothes. It will be fine once the blade's energy stabilizes in a moment. This time, he should have quite a substantial gain from this.\"\n\nJust as Feng Nü had said, such an opportunity allowed Nian Bing to absorb the magic elements in the air and convert them into his own magic power at dozens of times his usual speed. His magic power increased bit by bit, making his abilities continuously stronger. At the same time, it also brought him closer to the crisis of the Ice-Fire Homologous mutual struggle.\n\n......\n\nIce God Tower.\n\nThe Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess, in the midst of meditation, suddenly opened her eyes. \"It's appeared again. This time, there's also an energy I dislike. Could it be, could it be that someone from the Gongdi Rong Empire<sup>4</sup> got it? Oh, Stone of the Ice and Snow Goddess, I will find you.\"\n\nAmidst the flashing blue light, the Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess, without any warning, disappeared into the blue hexagram where she sat cross-legged.\n\n......\n\nThe red and blue lights finally gradually weakened. Nian Bing also awoke from that strange sensation. The speed of the Ice-Fire Homologous Whirlpool within him had noticeably increased by a few points compared to before. Its color had also deepened. He could clearly feel his magic power strengthening. As long as it could rotate, it was a good thing. He secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Looking at the Zhengyang Blade in his hand, which constantly radiated surging fire energy, he couldn't help but exclaim in admiration, \"What a magnificent Roar of the Flame God! Your power is definitely not inferior to Morning Dew's!\"\n\nA cough sounded. \"Nian Bing, shouldn't you find something to cover your body first?\"\n\nNian Bing froze for a moment, only then realizing that his clothes had disappeared. His smooth skin was completely exposed to the air. His mind went blank, and his face instantly turned crimson. He immediately summoned a set of coarse cloth clothes, and clumsily put them on.\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> *Dou Qi (鬥氣)*: A spiritual energy or battle aura common in cultivation fantasy, often enhancing physical abilities and elemental control.\n<sup>2</sup> *Chi (尺) and Cun (寸)*: Traditional Chinese units of length.

    "content": "Awkwardness, unconcealable awkwardness. Being naked in front of two girls—this feeling made Nian Bing wish he could smash his head and die. He forced a cough and said, \"Ri-Right, I'm sorry, just now, that...\"\n\nFeng Nü half-turned and peeked. Seeing Nian Bing was already dressed, she then pulled Maomao around. \"Alright, no need to explain. I've already finished the task you entrusted me with. I don't want payment; you just need to remember that you owe me one. Let me give you a suggestion. You seem to be carrying space-storage magic items on you. Since that's the case, these two blades don't need scabbards. Why conceal the sharpness of such precious blades?\"\n\nNian Bing lowered his head and thought for a moment, immediately understanding Feng Nü's meaning. When a mage faces a warrior, being able to quickly cast magic is key to victory or defeat. And whether the blades are unsheathed relates to whether these two precious blades, which can be used as magic staves, can simultaneously channel magic power through their bodies and better absorb magic elements. He glanced at the scabbards that had been thrown aside earlier, nodded, and said, \"You're right. Feng Nü, I must leave here immediately. The Morning Dew Blade's sharpness has been revealed; I'm afraid someone will come looking for me soon. Though we're not going the same way, let's leave together. You hurry and pack your things.\"\n\nFeng Nü sheathed the Heaven-Cleaving Longsword in her hand. She smiled faintly, \"There's nothing to pack. With it, it's enough. Everything Master left behind, let it all stay here. Maybe I'll come back sometime. Maomao, could you please wait for us by the door? I have a few words I want to say to your Brother Nian Bing in private.\"\n\nMaomao's adorable little face showed a sunshine-like smile. \"Okay! Sister. Then hurry up, okay? I'll go out first.\" After saying that, she ran and skipped out of the courtyard gate.\n\nFeng Nü looked at Nian Bing, and Nian Bing also looked at her. Both of them felt as if their hearts had skipped a beat. Nian Bing was still the first to speak, saying, \"Is there anything else?\"\n\nFeng Nü lightly bit her lower lip, and her voice, wrapped in battle qi, entered Nian Bing's ear. \"If, I mean if, we could always be together, would you be willing to accompany me to a place? There, perhaps many things would interest you. But, once there, you might never be able to return to the real world.\"\n\nNian Bing faintly felt something in his heart, and lightly sighed. He said, \"Feng Nü, do you know? You are the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Frankly, I truly like you. If it weren't for something I absolutely must do, perhaps I would agree to your request. However, my life now doesn't only belong to me. At the same time, it also belongs to my deceased Master and parents. We will always be friends, right? If it's meant to be, we will definitely meet again. I'm leaving. Goodbye.\" Morning Dew and Righteous Sun were simultaneously stored into the Spatial Ring. Nian Bing lowered his head and walked towards the direction of the main gate. As he passed by Feng Nü, suddenly, a red light flashed. The Heaven-Cleaving Divine Sword, still in its scabbard, suddenly rested on Nian Bing's shoulder without warning, a strong, mountain-like oppressive feeling making him unable to move an inch.\n\nFeng Nü's slightly chiding voice rang out, \"I knew you'd say that. You rascal!\"\n\nNian Bing forced himself to turn his head and look at Feng Nü. He found she was also looking at him, a faint smile in her azure eyes. \"Feng Nü, if I want to find you later, where should I go?\"\n\nFeng Nü said, \"You'd look for me?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"We're friends, why wouldn't I look for you?\"\n\nFeng Nü said in an exasperated tone, \"Then just directly shout 'Feng Nü' a thousand times, and I'll appear.\"\n\nNian Bing laughed heartily, \"I hope so. I really will shout!\"\n\nThe sword lifted from his body, and Nian Bing regained his freedom. Feng Nü walked to his side and whispered, \"I had Maomao go out first just to remind you of something. While Ice-Fire Coexistence Magic is a guarantee of strength for you, it's also a big trouble. On the continent, it's not just the known so-called masters; the true titans of martial arts and magic are hidden in the dark. I think those hermits will definitely be very interested in you. Don't stay in one place for too long.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, and said, \"Master also reminded me of that. Staying in Ice Snow City this time was a last resort; I won't make the same mistake again. Thank you, Feng Nü. Oh, right, did you know Maomao all along?\"\n\nFeng Nü was startled, and said, \"How did you know?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"Otherwise, as a successor of summoning magic, how could she reveal her secrets to you so quickly? Actually, I've always felt that you aren't as simple as you appear on the surface. But don't worry, I won't ask too many questions; everyone has their own secrets in their heart. It's good that you know Maomao. Then I'll leave her to you.\"\n\nFeng Nü gave Nian Bing an annoyed glare. She said, \"Don't you understand that sometimes being too smart isn't good?\"\n\nNian Bing shrugged his shoulders, and said, \"Of course I know that. If it were anyone else, even if I noticed, I wouldn't say anything. Alright, I really must go. Feng Nü, we'll meet again sometime.\" As he spoke, he opened his arms wide and suddenly embraced Feng Nü's fragrant, delicate body, then suddenly released her. Activating a personal Blizzard Scroll, his body was carried skyward by the condensing blizzard, disappearing in the blink of an eye, leaving only a few thin snowflakes in the courtyard.\n\nFeng Nü's pretty face was flushed as she looked at the sky. A strong, unfamiliar sensation continuously stimulated her delicate body. For the first time in her life, she had allowed an opposite-sex person to be so close, yet for some reason, she felt no repulsion. Nian Bing had left, and a feeling of wistful loss continuously assailed her heart.\n\n\"Maomao, come in. It's time for us to go too.\" The door opened, and Maomao, hearing Feng Nü's call, walked in from outside. However, the usually lively girl now looked a bit dull. Feng Nü was about to quickly pack her things and leave, when suddenly, she felt something was off. She walked up to Maomao, looked at her bewildered expression with suspicion, and frowned, \"Maomao, are you alright?\"\n\nMaomao looked at Feng Nü blankly, but didn't say a word. Feng Nü inwardly thought, 'Not good,' and pressed a palm towards Maomao's body. She didn't use force, but her palm easily passed through Maomao's body, a red light flashing and then fading. Maomao's body actually disappeared into thin air, and on the ground appeared a cockroach the size of an egg. It glanced at Feng Nü in a panic, then lowered its head. It then burrowed into the earth and vanished in the blink of an eye.\n\nFeng Nü was stunned for a moment, then an expression of both annoyance and amusement appeared on her pretty face. \"Oh, you Maomao, you dare to even deceive me! No wonder you agreed so nicely just now, using Illusion Art!\" She was completely certain that the large cockroach just now was definitely one of Maomao's summoned pets, whose characteristic was to transform into a humanoid illusion. The real Maomao had probably already run away.\n\nShaking her head helplessly, Feng Nü did not pursue. For Maomao, with her unique magic, it wouldn't be difficult to shake off someone. She sighed softly, and muttered to herself, \"She truly is Shilade's daughter. The pets cultivated by a Dragon Summoner indeed each have their own unique characteristics. Never mind, with Shilade's ability, it won't be hard to find his daughter. Why should I force it? I should still hurry to the Langmu Empire and do what needs to be done. Nian Bing, you're right. If it's meant to be, we will definitely meet again.\"\n\nNian Bing quietly left. Long after, people from the Ice Moon Empire's imperial family arrived in Ice Snow City to announce the king's transfer order. However, they couldn't find Nian Bing no matter what. Although the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild was not highly valued by the empire, the guild's name was still there. The king's envoy couldn't reach a conclusion either and could only return dejectedly. Although Jin Hao, the owner of Dacheng Xuan, was not very satisfied with this result, at least Nian Bing, the biggest threat, had left. If he reappeared at Qingfeng Zhai, Jin Hao could also use the charge of defying imperial edict to have Marquis Nuoya arrest him.\n\nWith Nian Bing's departure, Dacheng Xuan's business gradually recovered somewhat. However, due to Ming Yuan's improved culinary skills, they never managed to catch up to Qingfeng Zhai again.\n\nOne noon, three days after Nian Bing's departure, Qingfeng Zhai's owner, Xue Ji, found a letter on his daughter's room table while looking for her. The letter's content was simple, only a dozen or so words: \"Dad, I've gone to help you find Nian Bing. How can we give up such a good chef? Don't worry. Jing Jing.\"\n\nWith Nian Bing's departure, the ripples caused by him in Ice Snow City gradually subsided, and it returned to its original appearance. However, the struggle between Xue Ji and Jin Hao had not ended. When the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess came to Ice Snow City a second time to search for the Ice Snow Goddess Stone, the result was still the same. However, this time, the Goddess Priestess's temper was even worse, causing Marquis Nuoya to be implicated somewhat. Relying on the Goddess Priestess's influence over the Ice Moon Empire, he could only gradually fade from the political scene.\n\nNian Bing did not fly directly out of the city; after all, that would be too conspicuous. Relying on blizzard magic, he carefully landed in an uninhabited corner near Ice Snow City's South Gate, only then confidently walking out of this second-largest city of the Ice Moon Empire.\n\nWalking on the wide avenue, Nian Bing felt an indescribable ease in his heart. To him, Ice Snow City was like a giant cage. Although there were many beauties there enough to attract him, the feeling of being restrained was unbearable. Fortunately, everything he wanted to do was completed. The Righteous Sun Blade gained the title \"Roar of the God of Flame.\" And in the process of sparring with Ming Yuan, he also gained insights into some culinary details. Most precious was that he had taken Long Zhi as his Master. In three months, he finally filled the gaps in his magic theory. Although there were still many things he didn't understand, he had at least memorized them all. Understanding required time, and as long as the knowledge was in his mind, that time was merely a process. Nian Bing had full confidence in his own intelligence.\n\nOn both sides of the avenue were tall trees, seemingly at least several decades old. Their shade covered the sun's rays, bringing waves of coolness. The fresh air was refreshing to breathe. Nian Bing was not in a hurry to travel, walking slowly while pondering the magic knowledge in his mind that he still didn't understand.\n\nJust as he was immersed in his ocean of magic, a sudden voice startled him. \"Brother Nian Bing, you're so slow! I've been waiting for you for ages!\" This voice was all too familiar, and it held a hint of excitement and anticipation.\n\nNian Bing, who had thought he had escaped everything in Ice Snow City, subconsciously looked towards a large tree by the roadside. He said with some helplessness, \"Maomao, why aren't you with Feng Nü? Why did you run here instead?\" He was not without surprise in his heart. After all, he had flown for a while when in Ice Snow City, and the speed of flight was naturally incomparable to walking, yet Maomao had gotten ahead of him.\n\nMaomao bounced out from behind the tree, her charming smile bright. \"Brother Nian Bing, don't you want to see me? Papa often says Maomao is very cute.\" As she spoke, a wronged expression couldn't help but appear on her fair little face.\n\nNian Bing's brows slightly furrowed, and he said, \"Maomao, answer my question first.\"\n\nMaomao lowered her head and said, \"Sister wants to send me back, but I don't want to go back! If I go back, I'm afraid Papa won't let me out again. Brother, I don't know anyone, and I don't have money for food. Just let me follow you, okay? Maomao will be very well-behaved and obedient.\"\n\nNian Bing gave a bitter laugh, \"You and I have known each other for less than two *shichen*¹. Why are you so set on me?\"\n\nMaomao giggled, \"Because Sister Feng Nü said you're a good person! Of course, more importantly, you can make delicious food! That meal just now was the best Maomao has ever eaten. As long as I follow Brother, not only will there be fun things, but I'll also get to eat delicious food! Of course Maomao will cling to you. Brother, you won't abandon me, will you?\"\n\nNian Bing steeled his heart and put on a cold expression. \"Why wouldn't I? I'm not very familiar with you. For the sake of our brief acquaintance, here's some money for you to buy food on the road. Hurry home. I still have many things to do; how can I take you with me?\" As he spoke, he pulled out his money pouch from his pocket, grabbed a handful of purple-gold coins from it and put them back into his own pocket, then handed the rest, along with the money pouch, to Maomao before turning and walking away. He vaguely felt that this Maomao would definitely be a huge bother to him; it would be better to stay away from her.\n\nMaomao held the money pouch in her hand, watching Nian Bing walk away without looking back. She suddenly burst into loud sobs, \"Brother is not a good person! Brother bullies Maomao! Maomao is just a girl, and she's so pathetic alone outside! No food, no clothes! If she meets bad people, Maomao will die! Brother is so mean! Brother is so mean! Brother killed Maomao! Wuwuwu...\"\n\n---\n¹ *Shichen*: A traditional Chinese unit of time, equal to two hours.",

    "content": "Nian Bing had never been a stone-hearted person. He could leave Long Ling because Long Ling had her father and the Mage Guild as her backing. He could leave Xue Jing because, with Xue Jing's temperament, it would be good if she didn't bully others, so who would bully her? He could leave Luo Rou even more so because her wisdom sufficed for a thousand armies and ten thousand horses. As for Feng Nü, who had no backing, her own powerful strength was the best guarantee. Leaving them, Nian Bing felt at most a trace of reluctance, but no worry. However, this little girl named Xiyun in front of him was different. Having left home, she was without anyone to rely on; although she knew a little summoning magic, it wasn't enough to protect herself, and coupled with her naive personality, if she really encountered anything, he feared...\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing couldn't help but stop his steps. He secretly asked himself, could he abandon Maomao? The answer was no.\n\nMaomao saw Nian Bing stop, and her crying immediately ceased. She ran a few steps to Nian Bing's side, grabbed his arm, and said, \"Brother Nian Bing, you won't abandon Maomao, right?\" If any of the women Nian Bing knew in Ice Snow City had said this, he would certainly have felt a sense of ambiguity. However, coming from the tear-filled eyes of Maomao, his heart was filled only with pity.\n\nTurning to look at Maomao's hopeful face, Nian Bing sighed lightly, and stroked her soft, black hair. \"Tell me, where is your home? Brother will send you back.\"\n\nMaomao blinked her big eyes. \"I, I forgot, actually. When I left, to avoid Dad finding out, I chose to go at night, and I just ran out recklessly, not distinguishing paths. I've long forgotten the way back.\"\n\nNian Bing naturally wouldn't believe her words. \"Then can you tell me, when do you plan to play until before going home? Don't you miss your dad and mom?\"\n\nMaomao stuck out her tongue and said, \"Of course I miss them! But if I go back, I won't be able to come out and play. I have to wait until I've played enough to go back! Brother, please take me with you. I'll really be very well-behaved. I'll massage your back, and I can even summon Niuniu to help you carry things.\"\n\nFacing Maomao, Nian Bing had nothing more to say. \"Let's go for now. I think your father will definitely come looking for you. Remember what you said: don't cause me trouble on the road, and listen to my words. Of course, I'll also keep making you delicious things to eat. This is our agreement.\" As he spoke, he extended his hand to Maomao.\n\nMaomao smiled and slapped Nian Bing's hand, not a trace of sadness left on her face. In truth, Nian Bing had truly underestimated her. The daughter of the continent's only Dragon Summoner, did she truly lack the ability to protect herself?\n\nMaomao summoned her cow, Dandan, and rode onto it. This was no longer a city, and there weren't many people on the main road. Riding on a cow wouldn't attract attention. As they walked, Nian Bing asked Maomao, \"How did you escape from Feng Nü's place? I remember seeing you at the door when I left!\"\n\nMaomao giggled and said, \"Of course I have a way. You'll find out in a bit. Brother, since you're a mage, why don't you wear a magic robe? Your current clothes don't suit you at all.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"It's better to be low-key. These coarse cloth clothes are the most comfortable. Maomao, it seems your clothes haven't been changed in a long time, have they? When we reach the next lodging, I'll find a place to buy you some clothes. Oh, and, give me back my money bag.\"\n\nMaomao spread her hands, feigning innocence, and said, \"Money bag? Where's the money bag? Did I take your money bag?\"\n\nNian Bing, who could still indulge among flowers in Ice Snow City, now found himself utterly helpless with the girl in front of him. He snorted and said, \"Consider it unsaid.\" Then, he stopped talking and strode forward.\n\nAlthough Maomao's cow looked very fat, it showed no signs of fatigue following Nian Bing's pace. Even though Nian Bing no longer paid attention to Maomao, she herself was still having a lot of fun. As long as there was no one on the road, she would alternately summon her pets to play. However, as soon as the fox named Nana appeared, the cow would immediately stop, its bovine eyes revealing an angry gaze, forcing Maomao to only summon the mouse and Little Pink Pig to play.\n\nTo keep himself from getting angry, Nian Bing controlled his conversation with Maomao. Maomao was also very self-aware; as long as someone passed by on the road, she would immediately send her pets back into her embrace, and indeed, didn't cause any trouble.\n\nNian Bing had no specific destination or order in mind for his travels across the continent. Apart from participating in a competition ten months later in the capital of the Huarong Empire, representing the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild, he had no other particular tasks to do. So, his current destination was naturally Aolan Empire, to the southeast of the Ice Moon Empire. Once there, he could also conveniently help Luo Rou fulfill that entrustment. Of course, Nian Bing also had his own thoughts: back when he first traveled to Ice Snow City with his master, that beautiful young woman gave him a Tianhua Card. From a certain perspective, that young woman could be said to be his lifesaver. If he had the chance, he wanted to find that young woman and thank her with the culinary skills he had learned.\n\nNian Bing suddenly realized a very important problem: he had been too rushed when leaving Ice Snow City and hadn't even bought a map of the continent. Now, completely in the dark, it seemed he could only rely on luck to head southeast. He didn't know how far it was from here to the capital of the Aolan Empire.\n\n\"Brother, I'm hungry.\" Maomao finally couldn't help but speak to Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing turned back to look at the pitiful-looking Maomao, then looked around, and said, \"There's no village ahead, no inn behind here. Where am I supposed to get you food?! We just ate lunch barely an hour ago; I remember you ate quite a lot then!\"\n\nMaomao stuck out her tongue and said, \"I'm still growing, you know, so of course I eat more! Brother, I'm hungry.\"\n\nFacing this adorable girl, Nian Bing felt nothing but helplessness. \"Alright, let's rest by the roadside for a bit. I didn't bring any food either. If you really want to eat, I wouldn't mind helping you turn this cow into a delicacy. Of course, the mouse and pig can also work. Heh heh.\"\n\nSeeing Nian Bing's mischievous grin, Maomao's eyes showed a wary look. \"Brother is so bad, always thinking about my precious pets. They can't be eaten!\" Just then, she seemed to sense something. Her black eyes suddenly lit up. Nian Bing clearly felt a surge of mental energy emanate from Maomao, spreading outwards.\n\nThe ground moved slightly, and a small body burrowed out, quickly reaching Maomao's front, emitting rustling sounds. Nian Bing was startled, seeing such a large cockroach for the first time. Maomao rolled off the back of the cow Dandan, picked up the big cockroach from the ground, and giggled. She said, \"Thank you. Go back now.\" With a flash of red light, the cockroach instantly vanished from her hand.\n\nNian Bing asked in surprise, \"Is this your pet too?\"\n\nMaomao nodded. She said, \"Of course! It's because of it that I managed to stabilize Sister Feng Nü, allowing me to escape. Its name is Qiangqiang, and it's very well-behaved. It can distinguish my scent and find me even from a very long distance. And it can also conjure all sorts of illusions. What you saw when you left Sister Feng Nü's place earlier was me, transformed by it. Pretty amazing, right?\"\n\nNian Bing was still very interested in summoning techniques. Hearing this, he couldn't help but ask curiously, \"How did your pets get their skills? Although they look very ordinary on the surface, they all have many extraordinary qualities. Are they innate?\"\n\nMaomao said, \"Of course not. Dad cultivated them using special methods. However, their skills are random. I only discovered them one by one after forming contracts with each of them. So, Brother, don't underestimate Maomao!\"\n\nRespect appeared in Nian Bing's eyes, and he said sincerely, \"Then your father must be a great Summoning Mage. If I have the chance, I'd really like to ask him for more guidance.\"\n\nMaomao shook her head repeatedly. \"No, no, Dad is very fierce. It's best if you don't see him. Besides Mom, no one can control Dad. If he finds me, Maomao's little bottom will be miserable.\"\n\nNian Bing said, amused, \"You're quite bold. If I were your dad, after catching you, I'd definitely spank your bottom. Who told you to be so disobedient, daring to run away from home?\" As he spoke, he led Maomao to a shady spot by the roadside and sat down. After walking for half a day, as a mage, he was indeed a bit tired.\n\nMaomao sat down close to Nian Bing without any qualms. The cow was also well-behaved and went to the roadside to graze. \"Brother, what are you going to make for me to eat?\" Maomao looked curiously around, then at Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing smiled wryly. \"I came out too quickly, I didn't bring anything. I see that only wild vegetables here are edible, but I don't even have seasonings on me. How can I make anything? You'll just have to bear with it for now. Or, drinking some milk from your cow is also a good option. If we can find some wild beasts, or a village, food will be easy to solve.\" Although he was a chef, it was impossible for him to carry all his cooking tools with him.\n\nMaomao's eyes lit up. She said, \"Wild beasts are enough? That's too easy! Brother, wait a moment, watch Maomao. However, I'm only responsible for luring the beasts; you have to do the killing!\" As she spoke, a flash of light appeared in her black eyes, and her mental energy intensely fluctuated. \"By my name, Xiyun, I summon you, come forth, my pet, Nana.\" A red hexagram appeared before them, and the sneaky fox drilled out of thin air.\n\nThe fox Nana blinked its small eyes. As soon as it saw the cow, it immediately perked up. Just as it was about to rush over to drink the delicious milk, Maomao grabbed it by the fiery red long fur on its nape and lifted it. \"Nana, no mischief! You have to help Maomao, alright?\"\n\nNana squeaked a few times, a little agitated, its sneaky little eyes darting towards the cow. The cow had clearly sensed its aura, mooing and grumbling with an unfriendly gaze. It seemed ready to raise its body at any moment to attack the fox Nana with its rich and impactful milk.\n\nMaomao pointed to the nearby bush and said, \"Nana, go pee, quick. Once you're done, I'll let you go play with Dandan.\"\n\nNana blinked its eyes again, as if thinking, and only after a while did it reluctantly nod. Maomao put it on the ground. Nana rolled over, immediately ran into the bush, lifted a leg, and its peeing posture was surprisingly no different from a dog's.\n\nA pungent, gamey smell came with the breeze. Nian Bing and Maomao instinctively covered their noses. Nana gave a joyful yelp, seemingly feeling very comfortable, and with a boost, it pounced towards the cow Dandan. Dandan didn't actually shoot it with her milk, but merely raised a front hoof to kick at it. Nana's body was extremely agile; its previously straight path suddenly swerved and wound, bringing it under Dandan, where it instantly latched onto a teat and began to suck greedily.\n\nNian Bing looked at Maomao in confusion and said, \"Can this fox's urine attract wild beasts?\"\n\nMaomao giggled and said, \"Yes! Nana's urine is very unique. Doesn't it smell good?\"\n\nNian Bing snapped back, \"Smells good, my ass! Besides its fur looking passable, there's nothing about this fox that catches my eye. Fox meat doesn't taste good, it's very gamey. It seems its urine is even more pungently gamey.\"\n\nMaomao said unhappily, \"You're not allowed to talk about Nana like that! Actually, Nana is very clever. Among my pets, Nana is the strategist, you know!\"\n\nNian Bing burst out laughing. \"I've only heard of dog-headed strategists* before, I never expected a fox-headed strategist to appear now! If I get the chance, I'll have to see where its cleverness lies. Is it just about drinking milk?\" As he spoke, Nian Bing suddenly heard a rustling sound not far behind him. With some surprise, he stood up and looked into the bushes. He saw an animal slowly approaching his direction, seeming to be sniffing something. Its appearance was deer-like but small, with yellowish-black fur and no antlers. Its limbs were slender, with hind legs longer than its forelegs. It was a muntjac. This muntjac was small in size, with developed canine teeth, and its fangs were faintly visible.\n\nMaomao had clearly seen this animal for the first time. \"Brother Nian Bing, what is that thing?!\"\n\nNian Bing made a shushing gesture to Maomao, pulled her back behind a tree, and with a flick of his right hand, a green light instantly appeared as magic power was injected: it was the Whisper of the Free Wind—Aotian Blade.\n\nThe muntjac's speed wasn't fast. Nian Bing focused his attention, suddenly darted out from behind the tree, and fiercely slashed through the air. Although he didn't know martial arts, the weapon in his hand was an excellent precious blade. A green light flashed out from the Aotian Blade, bringing forth a wind blade. This level of wind blade was naturally nothing to a martial artist, but it was enough to deal with this muntjac. Where the blood splattered, the muntjac's body was instantly separated.\n___\n*Footnote: A Chinese idiom referring to a bad or foolish strategist, or one who gives poor advice.",

    "content": "Maomao covered her eyes, pouting, \"Brother, how cruel you are! To just casually kill living things.\"\n\nNian Bing said impatiently, \"If I kill it, what will you eat? If you find it distasteful, then *you* can eat it later. Come on, let's go into the forest to process it.\" As he spoke, he walked over to the muntjac, lifted its carcass, and after letting the blood drain from the wound, took the lead and walked into the forest.\n\nMaomao didn't dare to look at the dead muntjac, hiding beside Niu Dandan as she followed Nian Bing into the forest. The fox Nana, on the other hand, seemed very interested in the muntjac in Nian Bing's hand, hopping around beside him, seemingly begging for food.\n\nOnce in the forest, Nian Bing instantly cast a Tier 1 Ice Seal, freezing the entire muntjac, head included. Just as he was about to continue, Maomao leaned over and asked, \"Brother, what kind of animal is this! Can it really be eaten?\"\n\nNian Bing glanced at her and said, \"My true profession is a chef. If I can't even distinguish what's edible from what's not, I might as well give up. Learn something: this is a muntjac. Look, its canine teeth protrude slightly from its lips, so it's clearly a male. And it has a faint fragrance. If I'm not mistaken, this is even a musk deer. It seems our luck is indeed good.\"\n\nMaomao was intrigued by Nian Bing's words and asked curiously, \"Brother, what's a musk deer!\"\n\nA flash of light in Nian Bing's hand, and the Proud Sky Blade reappeared. He didn't touch the muntjac's body but cut directly at its head. As he worked, he explained, \"A muntjac is an animal, somewhat similar in appearance to a deer, but smaller. Male muntjacs have larger canine teeth, and their bodies carry musk. It's a rare and excellent culinary ingredient. It's quite good for medicinal cuisine. You're in for a treat today.\" As he spoke, he had already removed the muntjac's two canine teeth, then threw the muntjac's head to the drooling fox Nana nearby, \"Go eat over there; don't let me smell your rank odor.\"\n\nNian Bing laid the muntjac's body down. A flash of light from the blade in his hand, and he instantly opened a cut in the muntjac's abdomen. The fragrance instantly became tens of times more concentrated. Nian Bing carefully tore off a piece of cloth from his clothes, flattened it on the ground, and reached his hand into the opening in the muntjac's lower abdomen. From inside, he pulled out some sticky yellow crystals, carefully placing them on the cloth. \"It really is a musk deer, see? These yellow things are called musk, and they're the most precious part of a musk deer. When my master taught me cooking, he once showed me a book introducing various meat ingredients, which, when speaking of musk deer, mentioned that a musk deer is a male muntjac that carries musk. Male muntjacs with musk are called 'musk deer,' while females are just 'muntjacs.' This musk deer is a treasure from head to toe, especially this musk. When used as a spice, it has extremely strong scent retention and can also repel various small insects. If used as medicinal material, it has the effect of clearing meridians and opening sensory orifices. I'll make these musks into a gift for you later.\"\n\nAs soon as Maomao heard there was a gift, she had long forgotten the bloody scene from just now. \"Great! Great! What will you give me?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. He said, \"Don't rush, let's eat first.\" He carefully scooped out all the musk, wrapped it in cloth, and put it aside. His exquisite knife skills unfolded; while skinning the muntjac, he perfectly preserved all the meat. Taking advantage of the freezing, Nian Bing scooped out all the muntjac's internal organs and threw them aside, then broke off a relatively straight branch from a nearby large tree and skewered the muntjac through it. While doing all this, his Proud Sky Blade wasn't idle either; a small tree was completely chopped into firewood. If Xue Ji knew he used the Proud Sky Blade like this, would she feel heartbroken?\n\nA Tier 1 Fireball Spell was a simple matter for Nian Bing; the pile of firewood immediately ignited. There was no water here, but Nian Bing had ice magic. After being cleansed and scrubbed by ice, the dirt on the muntjac had already been washed off. Nian Bing looked at the muntjac, thought for a moment, and said, \"What a pity, there are no suitable seasonings here, otherwise it would be even more perfect. We'll have to make do.\" As he spoke, he began to roast the muntjac in his hand over the flames. Instead of supporting it with a wooden rack like normal barbecue, he relied entirely on arm strength to turn the branch in his hand. Nian Bing kept the muntjac far from the flames and turned it very carefully; his hand was very steady, and his attention was completely focused on the muntjac.\n\nMaomao asked doubtfully, \"Brother, my father used to roast meat for me too, but not from such a distance! You're so far from the fire, can it really cook?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Perhaps I'm far from being comparable to your father in magic, but when it comes to cooking, I'm afraid he's no match for me. Don't you know we don't have any seasonings right now? General barbecue requires brushing on sauce and oil, which ensures the meat won't scorch. But we don't have anything right now. To make the muntjac meat delicious and not scorched, we can only use its own fat. This muntjac is fat enough. First, we'll render out its internal fat, then gradually roast it. This way it will cook evenly, and the taste will also reach its best state. You just rest by the side and wait to eat.\"\n\nNo elaborate seasonings were available, but as the foremost of all flavors, Nian Bing still carried salt with him. He wasn't in a hurry to sprinkle the salt on; instead, he carefully turned the muntjac, his movements unhurried, always maintaining a steady rhythm.\n\nJust as Nian Bing had said, the fat gradually appeared during the roasting. Nian Bing gradually lowered the muntjac in his hand, while slowly channeling his fire magic power into the muntjac meat. As the magic power increased, the muntjac gradually turned red. At this point, Nian Bing picked out some of the musk he had extracted earlier and carefully applied it to the muntjac's body with the Proud Sky Blade. The Proud Sky Blade truly lived up to its name as a top-grade treasure blade; oil could not cling to it. After doing this, it was still as bright as before, its azure glow as captivating as a crescent moon in autumn water.\n\nNian Bing, focused on roasting the meat, and Maomao, beside him wiping her drool while savoring the aroma, both failed to notice that danger was approaching them.\n\nThe faint fragrance gradually became richer, as the unique scent of musk effectively blended with the aroma produced by the roasting fat. It was a mouth-watering aroma. Maomao's drool wasn't flowing too much, but the cunning fox had by now long given up on the muntjac head and honestly squatted beside Maomao. Drool was dripping steadily downwards, and its eyes were full of greedy light. Only the vegetarian Niu Dandan was able to remain unswayed by the scent at this moment, leisurely eating his green grass.\n\nHalf an hour later, the muntjac in Nian Bing's hands had completely turned golden-brown. The waiting Maomao and fox Nana's eyes were already fixated. Nian Bing alternated hands while roasting; if not for years of practice, he absolutely couldn't have sustained it for so long, as this muntjac weighed around twenty catties. With a faint smile, Nian Bing glanced at the person and beast beside him, \"Look at you two, as if you haven't eaten for many days. It's ready.\" As he spoke, he took out the salt he carried from his Spatial Ring. He sprinkled it evenly on the muntjac, using little salt, to prevent the muntjac's aroma from being masked by the salt.\n\nJust as Maomao and the fox Nana were about to rush forward, Niu Dandan's massive ox head suddenly lifted. The brown fur on his back suddenly bristled, and he let out a low bellowing roar that seemed to be a threatening growl. He retreated towards Nian Bing and Maomao while bellowing, as if he had encountered some kind of crisis.\n\nThe Proud Sky Blade in Nian Bing's hand trembled slightly; the surrounding wind elements visibly grew stronger, and a faint hum emanated from the blade. Nian Bing immediately understood the Proud Sky Blade's meaning. Although among the three blades he possessed, the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God were both ultimately forged with his own blood, making their connection more intimate, the Whisper of the Wind of Freedom was no weaker. When Nian Bing first used it to display his fastest blade technique, their tacit understanding had already been established. The Proud Sky Blade's hum had only one meaning: a warning.\n\nNian Bing casually handed the branch with the musk deer skewered on it to Maomao and pulled her behind him, whispering, \"Stay close to me. There might be danger.\" As he spoke, the Whisper of the Wind of Freedom gracefully disappeared, replaced by the Roar of the Fire God and the Sigh of the Ice Goddess. The Morning Dew Blade could be left unused, but it had to be prepared, because the unknown enemy's strength was unknown. If it was for survival, then nothing else would matter.\n\nA hissing sound rang out, and a strange look appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. What could it be, exactly?\n\nThe sound came from behind a tall thicket of bushes. Nian Bing calmly watched the bushes, his mouth already beginning to chant a spell.\n\nThe fox Nana peeked out from Nian Bing's feet, then suddenly trembled all over and leapt back into Maomao's arms. Maomao was startled for a moment, then said to Nian Bing, \"Brother, Nana seems very scared; that thing seems very dangerous, you must be careful!\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. The broad and sturdy Positive Yang Blade in his hand pointed forward, and a fist-sized Tier 1 Fireball floated out. Under the control of his mental power, it traced a graceful arc towards the back of the bushes. At the same time, he had already prepared a stronger spell.\n\nThe fireball raised a clear shower of sparks behind the bush, and an angry roar that made the earth tremble rang out. A massive black silhouette rose upright from behind the bush; the bush, originally over half a zhang tall, only reached its chest. With a roar, its enormous body pressed forward, immediately flattening the bush and revealing its robust body.\n\nNian Bing widened his eyes, looking at the creature before him. Heavens! What is this thing? It was indeed a creature he had never heard of. On the surface, it was about one zhang tall, its upper body standing upright, its entire body covered in an iron-gray keratinous layer, appearing extremely solid. Its body shape resembled a large lizard, but it was clearly much larger than any lizard. Two rows of black fin-like things stood upright on its back. Two powerful and thick hind legs supported its enormous body, and a long tail dragged behind it. When it roared, its enormous saber-teeth were revealed in its mouth. Its length from head to tail was nearly two zhang. Its forelimbs were significantly smaller than its hind limbs, but its claws were equally large. Nian Bing had every reason to believe that it could easily tear his body to shreds.\n\nThe earth was shaking as the monster stepped out of the bushes, its dark green eyes staring fixedly at Maomao behind Nian Bing—or, to be precise, at the musk deer in Maomao's hand.\n\nAn excited voice came from behind Maomao, \"Wow, it's actually a cute Iron-Backed Saber-Toothed Lizard! It's so big, it must be over a hundred years old.\"\n\nCute? Nian Bing didn't find this big guy in front of him cute at all; the invisible aura it emitted was already making it hard for him to breathe. Did it want to eat that muntjac? If he could trade a musk deer for its departure, that would be fortunate. \"Maomao, since you recognize this creature, does it have any characteristics?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! Father once told me that Iron-Backed Saber-Toothed Lizards are inherently ferocious. Once they see other creatures, they will definitely turn them into their food; there's absolutely no chance of luck. He even specifically instructed me that if I encountered such a thing, it's best to turn around and run. If I couldn't run, then to give Niu Dandan to it to eat, which would probably be enough to keep it busy for a while. Brother Nian Bing, quickly help me catch it, okay? If I can make it my little pet, I won't be afraid of being bullied anymore.\"\n\nNian Bing led Maomao, retreating step by step. \"You say it so easily. Let's worry about saving our lives first. Can you order your cow to be sacrificed? I'll try with magic; maybe I can repel it. But its keratinous layer seems very hard.\"\n\nThe Iron-Backed Saber-Toothed Lizard watched them covetously. For some reason, it wasn't in a hurry to attack.\n\nMaomao seemed not at all worried about her safety. \"Niu Dandan has already run behind us, so it might not be easy to make him sacrifice himself. Brother Nian Bing, I have some bad news for you: the Iron-Backed Saber-Toothed Lizard is also called the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon. Although it's not a true dragon, because it has some dragon bloodline, it's immune to some magic. I remember Father saying that ordinary Iron-Backed Saber-Toothed Lizards can be immune to all magic of all elements below Tier 4.\"\n\nHearing Maomao say this, Nian Bing immediately breathed a sigh of relief. \"That's good then. I can use magic up to Tier 6.\" Maomao giggled and said, \"Brother, but this Iron-Backed Saber-Toothed Lizard in front of you, which is over a hundred years old, isn't an ordinary Iron-Backed Saber-Toothed Lizard! Father also said that Iron-Backed Saber-Toothed Lizards over a hundred years old can be immune to all magic below Tier 6. Although not like true dragons who are immune to all magic below Tier 8, your magic will probably just be a tickle to it.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing felt the impulse to turn back and strangle Mao Mao. At a time like this, she still had the mood to be excited. Immune to all magic below the sixth rank, heavens! How could he fight it then, especially since he was a mage?\n\nIf he were alone, he was confident he could use Ice and Fire Coexistence magic to disrupt the vision of this Iron-Backed Earth Dragon, then fly away with Blizzard. But the problem now was that Mao Mao was with him, and Blizzard's power made it impossible to carry two people away. Could he just abandon her? The selfish thought had barely arisen in Nian Bing's mind before he immediately dismissed it. Absolutely not.\n\nThe Firewall Spell, prepared earlier, was unleashed through the Roar of the Fire God. Nian Bing immediately turned to Mao Mao and said, \"Quickly, take your pets and run as far as you can. Leave this place to me.\" Firewall Spell was a fourth-rank magic. Flames towering two zhang* immediately blocked the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon's advance.\n\nMao Mao looked at Nian Bing in surprise. \"Brother Nian Bing, but you're a mage, you can't beat it!\"\n\nNian Bing said impatiently, \"If I tell you to run, then run, hurry up! I'm here. If I can't beat it, can't I at least stall it? Go quickly!\"\n\nMao Mao looked at the concern in Nian Bing's anxious eyes, and something seemed to stir in her large black eyes. She responded with a sound of assent, then turned and chased after her cow, Dan Dan, and the fox, Na Na. They were already tens of meters away, each running faster than the other. Seeing Mao Mao running towards them, they immediately let out joyful cries.\n\nNian Bing had no time to pay attention to how Mao Mao was running. He turned around, his eyes showing a solemn expression, and softly chanted his practiced incantation: \"Great Fire God! Please allow me to borrow your left hand, to let flames descend upon the human world, to extinguish all evil forces, to let flames illuminate the earth, and destroy all obstacles in its path. — Left Hand of the Fire God.\"\n\nA huge dark silhouette passed through the Firewall Spell. Just as Mao Mao had said, the fourth-rank Firewall Spell had no effect on it whatsoever. The Iron-Backed Earth Dragon, whose mind was originally focused entirely on the delicious prey, seemed to be enraged by the Firewall Spell. It roared, then charged fiercely towards Nian Bing.\n\nA Blizzard scroll lifted Nian Bing's body to the side. Since he had to divide his concentration to control the Left Hand of the Fire God, he didn't fly very high. The Iron-Backed Earth Dragon seemed to have no interest in him whatsoever. It suddenly accelerated, chasing in Mao Mao's direction. Trees and bushes in its path were utterly ineffective as obstacles under the pressure of its massive body.\n\nNian Bing felt a surge of panic. Mao Mao wasn't running fast, and at the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon's speed, it wouldn't take long to catch her. The Left Hand of the Fire God, tightly clenched, shot past the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon's body like a meteor under Nian Bing's full control. It suddenly changed direction, heavily striking the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon's chest.\n\nSparks flew everywhere. With the Roar of the Fire God, this Left Hand of the Fire God unleashed power close to the sixth rank. Even with the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon's formidable defense, it couldn't help but pause for a moment from the impact, its forward momentum completely halted.\n\nThe Iron-Backed Earth Dragon turned around, its large dark green eyes filled with ferocity. Clearly, it was highly displeased with Nian Bing, who was like a fly.\n\nNian Bing knew that at this moment, only his Ice and Fire Coexistence could deal with the behemoth before him. He took a deep breath. Just as he had faced Long Zhi previously, he put back the Sigh of the Ice Snow Goddess in his right hand and took out the Ice Rod.\n\n\"Great Fire God! Please allow me to borrow your left hand, to let flames descend upon the human world, to extinguish all evil forces, to let flames illuminate the earth, and destroy all obstacles in its path. — Left Hand of the Fire God.\" A great burst of firelight erupted, and a massive Left Hand of the Fire God appeared to Nian Bing's left.\n\n\"Great Ice Element! Coagulate, become the ice of ancient frozen rivers, become the solid ice of moon essence. Ice and ice merge, appear, Dual-Color Ice Sealing Orb!\" The Ice Rod pointed diagonally, blue light points continuously coalescing. A massive ice sphere, filled with icy spikes, half light blue and half dark blue, appeared.\n\nThe Iron-Backed Earth Dragon's intelligence wasn't very low. It had originally intended to continue chasing Mao Mao, but suddenly it sensed the oppressive force coming from above. It couldn't help but stop, as if realizing something, let out a low roar, and then bolted, still running in Mao Mao's direction.\n\nNian Bing grew anxious. He knew he had no time to compress the magic. With a loud shout, the Dual-Color Ice Sealing Orb and the Left Hand of the Fire God were thrown out simultaneously. The red and blue masses of light bypassed the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon's body from two sides, heading towards the same point not far in front of it.\n\nUncompressed magic was much more stable, making it easier for Nian Bing to control. Additionally, the magic power enhanced by the Stone of the Fire God and the Stone of the Ice Snow Goddess before he left Ice Snow City made him control this magic with ease. He brought the Ice Rod and Zhengyang Blade together in front of him simultaneously and roared, \"Ice—Fire—Co—existence—.\"\n\nThe Left Hand of the Fire God and the Dual-Color Ice Sealing Orb suddenly collided in mid-air. Under Nian Bing's control, a tremendous explosive force immediately rebounded, charging directly at the forward-rushing Iron-Backed Earth Dragon.\n\nThe Iron-Backed Earth Dragon roared, its massive body suddenly curling up. The fin-like protrusions on its back abruptly turned golden.\n\nThe explosive force triggered by Ice and Fire Coexistence was indeed powerful. Even without compression, the unleashed power was equivalent to the peak of a seventh-rank magic. The surrounding vegetation was blasted by the immense explosive force, scattering everywhere, and soil splashed up nearly ten meters high.\n\nNian Bing landed on the ground, his face somewhat pale. The consecutive use of several powerful spells had already depleted half of his magic power. Although the resilience of Ice and Fire Coexistence was very strong, the amount of magic power still remained the greatest barrier limiting a mage's performance.\n\nAs the dust gradually dispersed, Nian Bing watched, dumbfounded, as the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon slowly stood up. Its keratinous layer had completely turned golden, and at the same time, its eyes changed from dark green to blood-red.\n\nWith an angry roar, the surrounding forest trembled along with it. Incredibly, it had sustained not a single scratch even after being subjected to a peak seventh-rank magic. The next moment, its massive body, with an incomparably furious charge, suddenly rushed towards Nian Bing. Roars erupted continuously, and the sound waves shook Nian Bing so much that he couldn't concentrate to chant spells.\n\nIn desperation, he had no choice but to take out two scrolls, scrolls for performing Ice and Fire Coexistence attacks. Although their power wouldn't be stronger than the previous attack, this was his only countermeasure.\n\nJust then, Mao Mao's clear voice suddenly rang out, \"Dan Dan, spray. Tian Tian, charge.\"\n\nEight milky-white beams of light, like lightning, struck the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon's massive body from the side, causing its forward momentum to waver instantly. The cow, Dan Dan, had by now rushed to a nearby spot, its two front hooves having just landed.\n\nA grayish-black figure, enveloped in a cloud of gray mist, charged right in front of the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon. Amidst a thunderous crash, the gray figure bounced back, and the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon's forward momentum finally halted.\n\nMao Mao had somehow run back, her little pink pig, Guan Guan, clutched in her arms, as she glared furiously at the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon.\n\nSeeing her return, Nian Bing immediately grew anxious. \"Mao Mao, why are you so disobedient? Why did you come back? Hurry and run!\" As he spoke, he shook his hand and flung out the two scrolls, then took a deep breath and quickly began chanting the spell for the second time.\n\nThe powerful attack of Ice and Fire Coexistence redirected the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon's target back to him. Nian Bing's heart was now devoid of anger or joy; his gaze was completely fixed on the colossal creature before him, with not a hint of retreat.\n\nHaving been hit twice by Ice and Fire Coexistence, though the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon wasn't harmed, the pain brought by the ice and fire dual-polarity impact was extremely intense. It suddenly lowered its head, and a brilliant golden light burst from its back. More than ten golden beams of light, accompanied by powerful tearing sounds in the air, shot directly towards Nian Bing. This time, the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon finally used its ultimate move.\n\nMao Mao cried out in surprise, \"Guan Guan, quickly use your ultimate move, Beast—Blood—Boil—!\"\n\nThe originally small pink pig, Guan Guan, now emitted an extraordinarily immense aura. Its entire body shot out of Mao Mao's arms, displaying a speed completely inconsistent with its size. Its body swelled tenfold as if inflated, enveloped in a swirling bloody light, and it furiously charged towards the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon. However, no matter how fast its movements were, they could never be faster than light. Those golden beams of light had already attacked Nian Bing.\n\n\"Ice—Fire—Co—existence—.\" Concentrating his last remaining magic power, Nian Bing activated Ice and Fire Coexistence once more. This time, under extreme mental concentration, the volume of the unleashed magic actually decreased by one-third. The immense magic power instantly exploded, forming an energy vortex that completely devoured the more than ten golden beams of light.\n\nThe Iron-Backed Earth Dragon's most formidable asset was still its body. Although these golden beams could attack from a distance, they weren't as powerful as they seemed. The magic's explosive force collided with its own energy, immediately canceling each other out. Under the tremendous impact, the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon couldn't help but stagger. And at this very moment, Guan Guan, fully activating its Beast Blood Boil technique, slammed into its body.\n\nWith a *bang*, the Iron-Backed Earth Dragon, which hadn't even been blasted away by Ice and Fire Coexistence, was actually sent flying by Guan Guan's collision. It rolled several times on the ground, and the spot where it was hit was a bloody red. The golden sheen emanating from its body was continuously concentrating towards that bloody red area, seemingly resolving its injuries.\n\nGuan Guan wasn't having an easy time either. Its enlarged body bounced back like a rubber ball. When it landed back in Mao Mao's arms, it had already returned to its previous size, and it closed its eyes as if very tired.\n\nNian Bing's entire body swayed. He struggled to control himself from falling, but a trickle of blood still involuntarily flowed from the corner of his lips. The Iron-Backed Earth Dragon's defense was indeed too formidable; even after exhausting his magic power, he still hadn't managed to inflict a single scratch on it.\n\nA piercing shriek suddenly burst from Mao Mao's mouth. The Iron-Backed Earth Dragon, which had just stood up, suddenly rolled over and fell to the ground again, looking as if it was in great pain.\n\nAlthough the shriek wasn't directed at Nian Bing, he still felt as if his brain had been pricked by needles. His body swayed, and he immediately fell to the ground. But he was still conscious at this moment, and four words flashed through his mind—Mental Magic.\n\nIn that shriek just now, Mao Mao's mental power erupted like a sharp cone. Nian Bing's mental power, which he considered strong, absolutely couldn't compare.\n\nPale-faced Mao Mao ran a few steps to Nian Bing's side. She seemed very weak. \"Brother Nian Bing, let's go quickly! It's all Mao Mao's fault, I've harmed you.\" As she spoke, she helped Nian Bing stand up again.\n\nSeeing Mao Mao on the verge of tears, Nian Bing comforted her, \"You can't blame yourself for this. That Iron-Backed Earth Dragon is indeed too powerful.\"\n\nMao Mao called over the cow, Dan Dan, and sent back the dizzy large rat, Tian Tian, and the weak little pig, Guan Guan. Supporting Nian Bing, she said, \"Brother, you ride Dan Dan first. I didn't expect that to be an evolved Gold-Backed Earth Dragon. We need to leave quickly; the mental deterrence just now can only keep it unconscious for a short while. It will wake up very soon.\"\n\nFacing the crisis, Nian Bing's mind was remarkably clear. \"It's unconscious? Then we still have a chance.\" His gaze fell upon the Zhengyang Blade in his hand, and Nian Bing let out a cold snort. \"Zhengyang is not only the Roar of the Fire God; it is also an unbreakable sharp blade. I refuse to believe this Earth Dragon's defense can withstand the Zhengyang Blade.\"\n\nWith a wave of his right hand, a magic scroll landed in his grip. Nian Bing casually unfurled the scroll, and instantly, the scroll transformed into a ball of flame, coalescing into a huge hand—the fifth-rank fire magic, Left Hand of the Fire God.\n\nAlthough his magic power was exhausted, his mental power remained. The Left Hand of the Fire God, under Nian Bing's control, took the Zhengyang Blade from his hand and immediately flew towards the Gold-Backed Earth Dragon.\n\nNian Bing had only one goal: to use the Zhengyang Blade's sharpness to kill the Gold-Backed Earth Dragon that was threatening his and Mao Mao's lives. This was the only chance; otherwise, how could they possibly outrun it?\n\nThe Left Hand of the Fire God perfectly merged with the Zhengyang Blade, the Roar of the Fire God, and rushed towards the fallen Gold-Backed Earth Dragon like a streak of light. Just as the red glow on the Zhengyang Blade was about to strike the Gold-Backed Earth Dragon, a voice suddenly rang out, \"Enough.\"\n\nThose two simple words struck Nian Bing's mind like a heavy hammer. His vision went black for a moment, and he couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of fresh blood. And the Left Hand of the Fire God, which was holding the Zhengyang Blade, unexpectedly dissipated on its own. A white streak of light suddenly flew out, carrying the Zhengyang Blade away to the side.\n\nOnly with Mao Mao's support did Nian Bing manage not to collapse again. He looked in terror towards where the white streak of light had vanished, only to see a man in white slowly emerge from that spot. This person was about the same height as him but thinner, appearing to be in his thirties, with a very ordinary appearance.\n\nHowever, what was extraordinary was his gaze. At first glance, his pair of dark phoenix eyes seemed quite plain. But when you truly noticed his gaze, you would immediately realize that his eyes seemed to possess a metallic quality, as if they could pierce through one's very soul, even with just a light sweep.\n\nNian Bing was astonished to find that his body, mind, and soul seemed to have been pierced by some indescribable thing. The extremely uncomfortable sensation made him involuntarily spit out another mouthful of blood, and his mind reeled with dizziness.\n\n---\n*   **Two zhang (兩丈):** A *zhang* is a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or 10.9 feet. Two *zhang* would be about 6.66 meters or 21.8 feet.",

    "content": "The Zhengyang Blade was in the white-clothed man's hand, and on his shoulder stood an eagle. It was, surprisingly, a white-feathered, red-eyed eagle, not large, about the size of a falcon. Its powerful talons were firmly gripping the white-clothed man's shoulder. It was clear that the Zhengyang Blade had been snatched by it earlier. What Nian Bing found strange was, wasn't this white eagle afraid of the temperature from the Zhengyang Blade?\n\n\"Papa.\" Mao Mao's cry tightened Nian Bing's heart. Although he had already guessed some things, he couldn't help but be a little surprised after Mao Mao's confirmation.\n\nHowever, he was not nervous at all at this moment. For a Magician without magic power, in front of a powerful Summoner, would being nervous even help? Facing it calmly was the best choice.\n\nSeeing her father, Mao Mao didn't eagerly rush out; instead, she edged closer behind Nian Bing. At this moment, Nian Bing had become her shield.\n\n\"Still not coming over?\" Looking at his daughter's panicked expression, Hilard was both annoyed and amused. These days, he had been searching for his daughter's whereabouts outside. However, Mao Mao was extremely cunning, using all sorts of methods to mislead Hilard. If it weren't for the special spiritual aura on several of her summoned beasts, Hilard truly would have been at a loss.\n\n\"Papa, Papa, why are you here? Big Brother Nian Bing is very weak right now; I can't go over. I need to help him!\" Mao Mao said, putting on an innocent look.\n\nHilard's gaze turned to Nian Bing, and he said indifferently, \"Since my daughter used summoning magic in front of you, and you are a Magician, you should already know our secret.\"\n\nNian Bing calmly looked at Hilard. Facing those eyes full of a metallic sheen, he didn't flinch at all. \"Indeed, I already know. Can you return my blade to me now?\"\n\nHe knew even more the meaning behind Hilard's words. From the first time he met Mao Mao, Nian Bing knew that to keep their secret, this lineage of white-clothed Summoners would never hesitate to kill those who knew too much to silence them.\n\nHilard looked at the Zhengyang Blade in his hand, and a strange light flashed in his eyes. \"Indeed, this is a good blade, and at the same time, a top-tier magic item. Unfortunately, with your current ability, you cannot fully unleash its power.\"\n\nWith a casual toss, the Zhengyang Blade flew towards Nian Bing. Relying on his familiarity with the blade, without even needing to look, Nian Bing easily caught it.\n\n\"Roar—\" The Golden-backed Earth Dragon's roar rang out again. It swayed as it stood up, still seeming a bit dizzy, looking around, searching for the presence of enemies.\n\nHilard turned to the Golden-backed Earth Dragon, and his eyes suddenly lit up. Nian Bing was astonished to see that Hilard's originally black pupils had suddenly turned completely white—a terrifying white. Two simple words came out of his mouth: \"Quiet.\"\n\nThat was a deterrence from the soul; spiritual power condensed into a surge, directly enveloping the Golden-backed Earth Dragon's massive body. The Golden-backed Earth Dragon, which Nian Bing's full-power attacks couldn't harm in the slightest, began to tremble violently at Hilard's simple two words, simply prostrating itself on the ground, not daring to move an inch.\n\nHilard's eyes returned to normal. He didn't pay attention to his daughter but looked at Nian Bing and said, \"Do you know why all the magic you used wasn't as effective as my two words?\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment and said, \"This Golden-backed Earth Dragon itself possesses extremely strong defensive capabilities. Its keratinous layer is like armor and a shield covering its entire body, providing extremely strong physical and magical defense. However, no matter what kind of creature, it will have weaknesses. I think that since this Golden-backed Earth Dragon's external defense is already so strong, its spiritual power probably isn't as formidable as its appearance. With your spiritual magic, by directly attacking its brain through spiritual power, you can naturally achieve results that I cannot. This is perhaps the principle of one thing being countered by another, just like water counters fire, or light counters darkness. Of course, I'm not disparaging spiritual magic; a warrior's Battle Qi can suppress ordinary magic, but spiritual magic is a warrior's bane. Even for Magicians, although their own spiritual power is not weak, the number who can withstand such a powerful spiritual attack from you is probably not many. Besides, you also possess miraculous summoning magic.\"\n\nA rare smile appeared on Hilard's stern face. \"To remain so calm when your magic power is almost completely depleted, your spiritual power is indeed impressive. I'll give you a chance. If you can survive the attack of the Snow Eagle on my shoulder, I'll spare your life. Mao Mao, come over here! Otherwise, I'll confiscate all your pets.\"\n\nMao Mao blinked, as if suddenly having decided something. With a flash, she blocked Nian Bing. \"Papa, you can't kill Big Brother Nian Bing! Big Sister Phoenix Woman said he's a good person.\"\n\nHilard's brow furrowed slightly. \"Phoenix Woman?\"\n\nMao Mao said, \"Big Sister Phoenix Woman told me to tell you the four words 'Daughter of the Phoenix.' Papa, just let Big Brother Nian Bing go. At most, I'll just go back with you.\"\n\nHilard snorted coldly and said, \"You little girl, you actually dare to bargain with me! Come over here.\" The last two words were filled with a deterrent aura. Under the pressure of his spiritual power, Mao Mao's face grew even paler. But she still stubbornly blocked Nian Bing, shaking her head forcefully.\n\nNian Bing patted Mao Mao's shoulder. \"Go on, go back to your father. I don't need a woman to protect me. Don't worry, I'll be fine.\"\n\nMao Mao looked back at Nian Bing, a hint of tears in her eyes. \"Big Brother Nian Bing, but you have no magic power now! The Snow Eagle is very powerful, Big Brother, you...\"\n\n\"With spirit as guide, lost child! I shall lead you into that lost eternity.\" Hilard's voice carried a strange magnetism. Hearing this voice, Mao Mao couldn't help but tremble all over. A bewildered look appeared in her eyes, and she turned around, facing her father, walking step by step towards Hilard.\n\nSpiritual magic was indeed extraordinary. Mao Mao obediently walked to Hilard's side and stood there, seemingly having lost her senses. Hilard said indifferently to Nian Bing, \"No matter what relationship you have with Phoenix Woman, and no matter what happened between you and my daughter, if you cannot block the Snow Eagle's attack, then you will only die.\"\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath, his gaze falling upon the Snow Eagle on Hilard's shoulder. \"Come.\"\n\nTwo simple words, yet full of confidence. With a wave of his right hand, four scrolls were flung out from his Spatial Ring, landing on the ground in front of him. Without magic power, all he could rely on now were scrolls. Although the creation of these scrolls had cost him a great deal of effort, for the sake of his life, he couldn't afford to worry about anything else at this moment.\n\nHilard smiled indifferently and said, \"Then I'll have to see what extraordinary power your Ice-Fire Confluence magic possesses. Little Snow, attack.\"\n\nThe air suddenly grew sharp with cold. The Snow Eagle spread its wings and flew from Hilard's shoulder. That cold sensation emanated directly from its body. This Snow Eagle itself actually possessed elemental attributes.\n\nWith a flash of light, another four scrolls fell into Nian Bing's hands. Although the Snow Eagle appeared far less intimidating than the Golden-backed Earth Dragon, he dared not show the slightest slackness.\n\nThe Snow Eagle moved. Its two-meter-long snowy white wings fully spread. Amidst a clear cry, two massive ice blades, condensed from ice, shot out from its wings. With a flash of blue light, they crossed and arrived before Nian Bing. Nian Bing flicked his finger, and a ball of flame ignited, rapidly forming a wall of fire in front of him. Immediately after, three more scrolls flew from his hand simultaneously, while he quickly retreated a few steps backward. The ice blades met the fire wall, and their attack power immediately weakened considerably. Just then, a huge dual-colored Ice Sealing Sphere rose from the ground. The remaining power of the ice blades could only leave two deep marks on it. The dual-colored Ice Sealing Sphere spun rapidly in the air, forming a beautiful arc from bottom to top, heading straight for the Snow Eagle. Offense was the best defense.\n\nA look of disdain actually appeared in the Snow Eagle's red eyes. Its wings suddenly retracted, and its body plummeted downwards, almost brushing past the Ice Sealing Sphere. With a sudden acceleration, it charged towards Nian Bing. However, Nian Bing simultaneously released two more scrolls. These were another pair of Ice-Fire Confluence attacks. A wild explosion rang out, and an attack mixing red and blue light formed a massive vortex, enveloping the Snow Eagle's body. This was also the strongest attack he could unleash now.\n\nA clear and sharp cry once again came from the Snow Eagle's mouth. It did not possess the formidable defensive capabilities of the Golden-backed Earth Dragon. Ice-Fire Confluence caused two extreme magics to erupt simultaneously, and the power generated by the alternating hot and cold was certainly not simple. The Snow Eagle, originally charging forward, actually forcefully changed its direction of impact mid-air, soaring straight up, shooting into the sky just before the Ice-Fire Confluence could reach it, forming a parabola in the air, leaping over the Ice-Fire Confluence, and charging at Nian Bing again.\n\nNian Bing's eyes widened. He spat out another mouthful of blood, bit the tip of his tongue, and pushed his spiritual power to its limit. \"Return.\" The Ice-Fire Confluence, originally surging forward, was forcefully halted in its momentum. It turned around, sweeping from behind towards the Snow Eagle in the air. At the same time, Nian Bing raised his Ice Rod high. \"Ascend, Ice Baptism!\" The four magic scrolls he had thrown earliest shattered simultaneously. Cold air surged skyward, instantly transforming into a massive ice shield, enveloping the Snow Eagle's body from the front and restricting its movement. Ice Baptism was a Tier 6 ice-elemental magic. Two of Nian Bing's four scrolls could unleash its power, while the other two were auxiliary Tier 4 Ice Enhancement Techniques. Under the simultaneous effect of the four scrolls, in just an instant, the ice shield in the air was already a foot thick, leaving only the direction from which the Ice-Fire Confluence was sweeping from behind unsealed.\n\nThe Snow Eagle also sensed the danger. With a sharp cry, it forcefully flapped its wings downwards. Its entire body was enveloped in a layer of blue light, and it shot upwards like an arrow.\n\n\"Trying to run? No chance. Flame Shift.\" In the originally empty space within the ice shield, surging purple flames suddenly erupted. The flames enveloped the entire space inside the ice shield, just before the Snow Eagle reached the topmost ice wall, and at the same time, enveloped the Snow Eagle's body. It was then that Nian Bing, who had continuously used spiritual power to forcefully control the magic, finally couldn't hold on any longer and plopped down onto the ground. The Ice-Fire Confluence attack, which had been sweeping in from behind, also dissipated near the ice shield due to the loss of magic control.\n\nA shattering sound clearly rang out. The Snow Eagle's body shot skyward, but its previously crystalline, snowy white feathers had now turned it into a black eagle.\n\nThe Snow Eagle's body suddenly grew a bit larger in the air. Piercing cries continuously resounded. Snowflakes actually began to flutter in the air, dancing in the wind, becoming increasingly fierce and strong.\n\nNian Bing's heart went cold. He knew that if he could have maintained control for just one more instant, even if Ice-Fire Confluence couldn't kill this powerful magical beast, it could at least have severely wounded it. But now, it seemed he had no chance. The ability the Snow Eagle was using at this moment was clearly far more formidable than a Tier 4 Blizzard. He no longer had any magic scrolls above Tier 4 that he could use. There was nothing he could do but sit and wait for death. However, Nian Bing did not close his eyes. Looking at the Snow Eagle in the air, his heart was filled with unwillingness.\n\n\"Enough, Little Eagle.\" A red light suddenly flared, enveloping the Snow Eagle's body, which then vanished. The recently condensed blizzard also disappeared with it.\n\nHilard slowly walked up to Nian Bing. Feeling the still active magic elements around them, he smiled indifferently and said, \"You are stronger than I imagined. Did you create those scrolls?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Indeed, I made them. I didn't completely block your Snow Eagle's attack, so why did you let me go?\"\n\nHilard extended his hand to Nian Bing. Nian Bing didn't stand on ceremony and took his hand to stand up. His body swayed for a moment. The dizziness in his mind seemed to grow even stronger. If not for the constant warm aura emanating from the Heaven's Splendor Token on his chest, he probably would have already collapsed and fainted.\n\nA light flashed in Hilard's hand, revealing a cherry-sized greenish pill. \"Eat this. The lost magic power can only be recovered by yourself, but this Spirit-Settling Pill can alleviate your discomfort.\"\n\nNian Bing took the pill and swallowed it immediately. Upon entering his mouth, the pill instantly transformed into a bitter liquid that slid into his stomach. A wave of warmth rose within him. Nian Bing's forehead broke out in a thin sweat, but his mind felt much clearer. He didn't thank Hilard, merely watching him silently, waiting for him to speak.\n\nHilard also looked at Nian Bing. \"Aren't you afraid I gave you poison?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Senior, don't you think that question is a bit superfluous? If you wanted to kill me, you'd have a hundred ways. Why resort to a vile method like poison? Besides, when you just told me to withstand the Snow Eagle's attack, I already knew you had no intention of killing me. If you have any questions, you can ask them now.\"",

    "content": "Hilard's eyes showed a hint of surprise, \"Alright, you can be considered a talent. Ice-Fire Dual Source magic and our summoning techniques are equally mysterious and have a long history. However, the reason I'm not killing you isn't because of that, but because you previously disregarded your own safety and sacrificed yourself to let my daughter escape. How long have you known Maomao?\"\n\nNianbing gave a wry smile, \"About two *shichen* and a bit*, I guess. We just met before noon. You can rest assured, I just see her as a younger sister.\"\n\nHilard said, surprised, \"Only two *shichen*? To gain Maomao's trust in such a short time, it seems you truly have extraordinary qualities. What about the Phoenix Girl Maomao mentioned? What's her relationship with you?\"\n\nThe beautiful face of the Phoenix Girl flashed before Nianbing's eyes. He said calmly, \"I suppose we're friends. Maomao just mentioned the 'Phoenix Daughter', I don't know what that means?\"\n\nHilard's eyes flickered, saying, \"You don't need to know that for now. If the Phoenix Girl wants to tell you, she naturally will. It's too dusty here, let's go sit over there for a while.\" Saying that, he pointed in the direction Maomao had fled earlier.\n\nNianbing secretly breathed a sigh of relief. This mysterious summoner before him had indeed put immense pressure on him. In his heart, Maomao had become synonymous with trouble. Ever since meeting her, his troubles hadn't stopped. Now, what he hoped for most was for Hilard to quickly take Maomao away.\n\n\"Lost child, awaken.\" The magnetic voice rang out again. The spiritual fluctuation was wondrous, a special wavelength. It seemed only Maomao could perceive it. Her whole body trembled, and she awoke from her daze. After being stunned for a moment, she immediately locked her gaze on Nianbing. \"Brother Nianbing, are you alright?\" She ran to Nianbing in a few quick steps, looking him up and down, her eyes filled with concern. The playfulness from when they first met was gone; at this moment, Maomao seemed to have grown up a lot.\n\nNianbing instinctively patted Maomao's head, smiling, \"Don't worry, I'm fine. The senior just played a joke on me.\"\n\nMaomao looked at her father doubtfully. Hilard snorted coldly. He said, \"It seems like your dad isn't as important as an outsider in your heart. I'll settle accounts with you when we get back.\"\n\nMaomao blinked, giggling, \"Dad wouldn't do that, Dad dotes on Maomao the most. I already know I was wrong. Or, how about you let Mom punish me?\"\n\nHilard chuckled, \"Her? If she pampered you like this, you wouldn't be naughty enough to run away from home.\" The three walked to the side and found a clean spot to sit down. Nianbing specifically picked up the musk he had wrapped in cloth earlier.\n\nMaomao giggled and ran to the side. In a moment, she returned carrying the roasted roe deer from earlier, \"It's still warm, Dad, Brother Nianbing, let's eat together.\"\n\nNianbing took the fragrant roe deer. With a flick of his wrist, Arrogant Heaven Blade appeared. He found a few clean leaves nearby and spread them on the ground. White light flashed continuously in his hand, and pieces of fragrant roe deer, skin and all, appeared neatly on the leaves. \"Senior, Maomao, this place is quite remote, so please make do with this.\"\n\nSeeing that her father seemed to have no more hostility towards Nianbing, Maomao immediately relaxed completely. Disregarding the oil on the fragrant roe deer, she picked up a piece with her hand and put it into her mouth.\n\nHilard looked at Nianbing and asked, \"Who did you learn your Ice-Fire Dual Source from? I'm quite familiar with the magic world, but I've never heard of anyone who can use this legendary magic. Your magic power seems to only be at the Arch-Mage level, but relying on Ice-Fire Dual Source, you can unleash magic with power close to a Magic Seeker. If it weren't for encountering a rare species like the Golden-backed Earth Dragon just now, ordinary magic beasts absolutely wouldn't be able to harm you.\"\n\nNianbing smiled calmly, saying, \"If I told you that my Ice-Fire Dual Source magic was cultivated through my own exploration, would you believe me?\"\n\nHilard's brows furrowed slightly, but he quickly nodded, saying, \"I believe it. Back then, the ancestors of our white people, the great Saint Summoners, also gained powerful strength through their own wisdom, creating the profound magic of summoning techniques, as well as auxiliary spiritual magic. Ice-Fire Dual Source magic must have existed before, otherwise it wouldn't have legends just like summoning techniques. Your ability to find the way into Ice-Fire Dual Source proves that the opportunity is already there. This is also an important reason why I didn't kill you.\"\n\nNianbing gave a wry smile, \"But this cultivation isn't easy. It's magic that no one has ever cultivated, so I can only explore it little by little on my own, while constantly being wary of the possibility of the two extreme magic elements, ice and fire, exploding at any time. Even now, I haven't figured out whether what I'm cultivating truly counts as Ice-Fire Dual Source magic.\"\n\nHilard thought for a moment and said, \"It probably isn't complete yet. Actually, I was already here when you were roasting the meat. It's just that I saw you simultaneously using both ice and fire magic to cook the fragrant roe deer, so I didn't show myself. Later, when you were fighting the Golden-backed Earth Dragon, I discovered that although your Ice-Fire Dual Source could, to a certain extent, unleash stronger magical attack power by utilizing two opposing magics, it wasn't true Ice-Fire Dual Source. Because, when the magic elements explode, you still can't completely retain the characteristics of ice and fire. Otherwise, even with the Golden-backed Earth Dragon's strong defense, it would be absolutely impossible to fully withstand the attack of true Ice-Fire Dual Source magic. First cold then hot, or first hot then cold, is the best way to break through any defense. Under expansion and contraction, as long as the power is sufficient, even the strongest defense has a chance of being broken through. Young man, you still have a long way to go. Just like my ancestors, no one can truly help you; everything can only rely on your own efforts.\"\n\n\"Dad, aren't you going to have a piece? It really smells so good! When we go back, will you make it for me too? If there's good food, I promise not to sneak off again.\" While saying that, she handed a piece of fragrant roe deer meat to Hilard.\n\nHilard casually took the roe deer meat his daughter handed him and put it into his mouth. After just one chew, an expression of surprise immediately appeared on his face. At this moment, Nianbing was pondering Hilard's words. Hilard could be said to have brought him to a sudden realization**. Just as he said, if he could, while using Ice-Fire Dual Source to increase magical attack power, also let these two diametrically opposed magic elements each exert their own characteristics. In that case, it wouldn't just be a simple explosive increase in attack; the attributes of ice and fire would also be fully displayed.\n\nA fiery red figure stealthily approached the three of them. Maomao's eyes flickered. She immediately noticed its presence and said irritably, \"You, come over here, Nana. Where did you disappear to just now? Hmph, you run back as soon as you smell meat. You dead fox***, let's see how I'll deal with you when we get back.\" The last sentence was entirely in the tone her father had used when speaking to her just now.\n\nThe fox Nana walked to Maomao's side with its head lowered, saliva drooling from the corner of its mouth, looking at Maomao with a greedy, pleading expression.\n\nHilard glanced at the fox and said, \"Maomao. Just give it some food. It hasn't evolved yet. It doesn't possess the ability to attack on its own, so you don't need to blame it.\" After hearing Hilard's words, the little fox actually nodded repeatedly, looking fawning.\n\nMaomao snorted, saying, \"You little opportunist****, I doted on you for nothing usually. Your punishment is no light milk for a month.\" While saying that, she threw a piece of meat Nianbing had cut to the fox Nana. Nana, at this moment, no longer cared about any punishment. It held the roe deer meat with its two front paws and ate wildly. At this point, thanks to the effects of the Whispering Arrogant Heaven Blade of the Wind of Freedom, only the skeleton of the roe deer remained. Nianbing threw the skeleton beside the fox as well, and he himself picked up a piece of meat and started eating.\n\nHilard said, \"Nianbing, your knife skills are very proficient. Do you also cultivate martial arts?\"\n\nNianbing was stunned for a moment, then smiled, \"No. Just cultivating magic, I still have a long way to go. How could I also cultivate martial arts? If I did that, I'm afraid I would never be able to glimpse the peak of any single ability in my lifetime.\"\n\nHilard nodded approvingly, saying, \"Exactly, that's right. Ice-Fire Dual Source alone already requires you to spend most of your energy researching it. Don't learn too many things just because you're smart; that won't do you any good at all. Your current blade should be a top-tier wind-element magic item, and that flame blade from earlier, why would you use them to cut meat?\"\n\nNianbing smiled slightly, saying, \"Because they are both my magic wands and my kitchen knives! My true profession is a chef.\" At this moment, for some reason, Nianbing felt a few more points of goodwill towards Hilard. Although Hilard had maintained a cold expression, his unpretentious tone and demeanor reminded Nianbing of his own determined father.\n\n\"What? A chef? An Arch-Mage working as a chef?\" Hilard looked at Nianbing, somewhat disbelieving.\n\nNianbing smiled slightly, saying, \"That's the truth. My culinary skills are much stronger than my magic.\"\n\nHilard picked up another piece of roe deer meat. He didn't ask further, just nodded in agreement, saying, \"Indeed, the food you made tastes really good.\"\n\nJust then, a strong golden light suddenly caught the attention of Nianbing and the other two. The direction from which the golden light emanated was precisely where the Golden-backed Earth Dragon, previously restrained by Hilard's spiritual magic, was.\n\nHilard's expression changed slightly; he seemed to be contemplating something. Soon, a hint of joy appeared in his eyes. \"Excellent, that Golden-backed Earth Dragon actually mutated. Don't move from here. A mutated Golden-backed Earth Dragon is very terrifying. I'll be back soon. Maomao, haven't you always wanted a powerful pet? Now you have one.\" While saying that, Hilard waved his right hand, and a red magical hexagram appeared before him. As red light flickered, a large blue bird, about three meters long, appeared before Hilard. He directly mounted the bird's back. Making a strange sound, the blue bird***** immediately carried his body and soared high, flying towards the direction where the golden light appeared.\n\nNianbing watched Hilard use summoning techniques without needing a single incantation, and he couldn't help but feel great envy. If he could also have such a summoned beast, wouldn't traveling across the continent be much more convenient?\n\n\"Brother Nianbing, I'm sorry.\" Maomao suddenly lowered her head and said to Nianbing.\n\nNianbing was stunned, saying, \"Maomao, what's wrong?\"\n\nMaomao still kept her head down, saying, \"I know I made a mistake, but can you forgive Maomao?\"\n\nNianbing smiled, \"Silly girl, you ran back to save me at my most dangerous moment, what else is there to be wrong about? What is it, exactly?\"\n\nMaomao insisted, \"You have to promise to forgive me first, then I'll tell you.\"\n\nNianbing laughed heartily, \"Alright, I'll forgive you no matter what it is. Now you can tell me.\"\n\nMaomao grabbed the fox Nana, who was still eating roe deer meat on the ground, and said, \"The Golden-backed Earth Dragon earlier was probably attracted by Nana's urine smell.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly, \"It seems your precious fox's power is quite considerable! However, I already guessed that. That Golden-backed Earth Dragon must have first been attracted by the smell of urine, and then noticed us after smelling the fragrant scent of the roe deer. There's nothing to it, why would I be angry with you?\"\n\nMaomao looked up and secretly glanced at Nianbing, whispering, \"There's one more thing. Actually, Earth Dragons are very greedy. Although they're ferocious, if we had just given it the roe deer, it wouldn't have noticed us at all. I wanted to see how powerful Brother's magic was, so I lied and told you it would definitely attack us. But, but I also didn't expect it to be a Golden-backed Earth Dragon.\" As soon as the words left her mouth, Maomao's head drooped even lower, like a little girl awaiting judgment, looking especially pitiful.\n\nNianbing looked at Maomao with a hint of bitterness. He only now understood that all his desperate struggles were just because of a lie from Maomao. But what could he blame Maomao for now? He sighed softly, stroked Maomao's soft black hair, and said, \"Never mind. But in the future, absolutely don't play such jokes again, they can be fatal! Be good, Maomao. Brother won't blame you.\"\n\nMaomao suddenly lifted her head, her eyes shining brightly, \"Brother, you really don't blame Maomao anymore?\"\n\nNianbing nodded helplessly, thinking: What's the use of blaming you? Things have already happened. Anyway, you little devil****** will leave with your father soon, so why should I keep blaming you?\n\nMaomao cheered, suddenly hugged Nianbing, and kissed him hard on the cheek, \"Brother is the best, Brother is the best.\"\n\nThe moment Maomao flung herself into his arms, Nianbing realized that Maomao really was just a child. Her soft, delicate body carried a faint fragrance. Although her figure wasn't as slender as the Phoenix Girl's, beneath her somewhat torn, loose clothes, she could definitely be considered a blossoming bud. He was just about to say something to cover his embarrassment when the ground suddenly shook violently. Nianbing and Maomao looked towards the direction where the golden light had appeared earlier, only to see Hilard already flying high in the sky on the blue bird, gazing at the golden light below.\n\n***\n\n\\* *Shichen (时辰) is a traditional Chinese unit of time, equal to two hours.

    "content": "Nian Bing asked Mao Mao, \"Do you know what's going on? Has that Golden-backed Earth Dragon given birth again or something?\"\n\nMao Mao thought for a moment and said, \"Iron-backed Earth Dragons are already powerful creatures. If they reach a hundred years old, their physical strength will increase. At three hundred years old, Iron-backed Earth Dragons will evolve into Golden-backed Earth Dragons. That's what you saw earlier. Papa once said that Golden-backed Earth Dragons are the kings of the earth; unless it's a true dragon, few creatures can contend with them. Both their physical and magical defenses have reached their peak. However, our mental magic is precisely the bane of these earthly kings. As it is now, it's very likely that the Golden-backed Earth Dragon has evolved again under the stimulation of Papa's mental magic. I don't know to what extent it will evolve. From what Papa said, it seems he wants to get it for me as a pet. That's wonderful.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, suppressing his curiosity, and whispered, \"Stay here, don't move. I'll go take a look.\"\n\nMao Mao giggled and said, \"If you're going, we'll go together. Anyway, it's also far.* With Papa here, we'll be fine.\"\n\nNian Bing glanced at her, nodded helplessly, and said, \"Then be sure not to make a sound, and be careful behind me.\"\n\nAnswering him, Mao Mao placed her fox Na Na on the ground and led the way towards the direction of the golden light. When the two of them looked from behind a large tree towards where the golden light was emanating, it was indeed that Golden-backed Earth Dragon. However, its appearance had now begun to change. Its already very large body had shrunk slightly, but two huge protrusions had appeared on its back, and its four limbs looked even thicker. Its entire body had completely turned golden, its keratinous layers clearly defined, looking more like it was covered in a layer of golden scales. Its dorsal fins were longer than before, and they seemed to be twisted together, forming spear-like protrusions, about one meter high. Upon closer inspection, there were nine such twisted dorsal fin protrusions, resembling nine spears extending from its hind neck all the way to near its tail. At the same time, its tail had also changed. Its originally long tail had forked, dividing into nine strands. However, it had not yet fully formed.\n\nGolden flames continuously spewed from the Golden-backed Earth Dragon's mouth, and its scorching breath caused the surrounding vegetation to completely wither and scorch. It seemed very excited, its large blood-red eyes gleaming ferociously. The golden glow around its body seemed to form a natural protective layer, appearing and disappearing intermittently, and its life force was continuously growing stronger.\n\n\"Roar—\" A roar erupted from the Golden-backed Earth Dragon's mouth. It suddenly raised its huge head and spewed a massive stream of golden flames towards Hilarod in the air.\n\nHilarod snorted coldly. The Azure Bird carried his body high into the air, dodging the golden flame attack. The Golden-backed Earth Dragon, after spewing a mouthful of golden flames, seemed very tired, its large head lowered as it continuously panted, as if trying to gather more strength to attack Hilarod again. Alas, Hilarod would no longer give it a chance.\n\n\"By my life as a guide, by my blood I call upon you, noble Karodylis! My companion! Show forth your greatest power!\" On the Azure Bird's back, he swiftly bit his finger and drew a small six-pointed star in the air, guided by his blood. The moment the six-pointed star was completed, the Azure Bird beneath him suddenly trembled violently. Hilarod patted the Azure Bird's back. With a flash of light, it vanished into thin air. Hilarod's body naturally began to fall towards the ground.\n\nJust then, the surrounding air suddenly grew heavy. The red six-pointed star Hilarod had drawn earlier instantly magnified, and Hilarod's body suspended in mid-air. A huge black shadow slowly emerged from the red six-pointed star. The previously clear sky suddenly became overcast with dark clouds. A low dragon's roar echoed, and the dark clouds in the sky churned. Hilarod, suspended there, was carried aloft by the enormous black figure. Yes, it was a giant dragon, a green giant dragon.\n\nNian Bing could hardly believe his eyes. He rubbed them hard. A dragon? Is it really a dragon? Hadn't it been said that the Dragon Clan had already been destroyed during the Ancient War Era? How could a dragon appear again? Heavens! Mao Mao's father could actually summon a real dragon. Clouds followed the dragon's arrival—this was truly the so-called \"clouds follow the dragon!\"*\n\nYes, it was indeed a giant dragon, its body more than seven zhang long. Its two huge dragon wings spread wide, casting a pall over the earth. It had a pair of deer antlers on its head, whiskers at the corners of its mouth, and a pearl beneath its forehead. Its entire body was covered in azure scales, and its four limbs beneath its belly were thick and powerful. A single dragon claw was already as large as the Golden-backed Earth Dragon's head. Its massive body twisted slightly in the air, its wings unfurled, all four claws extended, as it descended towards the ground. The powerful wind swept everything around. The Golden-backed Earth Dragon, radiating golden light all over its body, suddenly trembled, and it looked up and roared at the Azure Dragon.\n\nA dragon's roar sounded again. The azure giant dragon seemed to be roaring furiously, and the mighty Golden-backed Earth Dragon actually lowered its head as if daring not to defy. Where the Azure Dragon landed, its four powerful dragon claws gripped the scales on the Golden-backed Earth Dragon's back, continuously letting out low moans. The Golden-backed Earth Dragon seemed to be communicating with it, only its voice grew weaker and weaker.\n\nHilarod slid down from the Azure Dragon's back onto the ground. He looked at the Golden-backed Earth Dragon up close and smiled contentedly. \"Thank you, noble Karodylis. I'll have to trouble you to take it back first.\"\n\nThe azure giant dragon nodded at him and, surprisingly, spoke in human tongue: \"To survive, it has submitted. I have promised it that after a hundred years, it will be allowed to enter the Dragon Clan.\"\n\nThe Azure Dragon Karodylis nodded at Hilarod, then let out a dragon's roar towards the sky. It turned its massive head to look at Nian Bing and Mao Mao's hiding spot. \"Little Mao Mao, you must listen to your Papa, otherwise, Uncle Dragon will spank your little bottom.\"\n\nFacing the azure giant dragon, Mao Mao wasn't afraid at all. She emerged from behind the tree, giggled, and said, \"Uncle Dragon wouldn't bear to spank me! I'll just go back with Papa. Oh, but you have to let Mao Mao pluck some whiskers to play with, okay? I heard someone say this time that if dragon whiskers are made into a whip, they can whip stone into powder.\"\n\nThe azure giant dragon let out a low roar, its huge dragon head dropping powerlessly. It said helplessly, \"You girl, you're getting bolder and bolder! Alright, I'm leaving now. Go back and let your Papa spank your bottom.\" Although it spoke words of blame, there was no actual blame in its tone. With a powerful flap of its strong wings, it made Hilarod step back a few paces. It then soared into the air, carrying the Golden-backed Earth Dragon's massive body, and flew towards the high sky. In a short while, it had passed through the clouds. When the dark clouds gradually dispersed, the magnificent giant dragon Karodylis had already vanished.\n\nNian Bing stood there, seemingly lost in thought. Suddenly, with a flick of his wrist, his Ao Tian Blade sliced into a nearby large tree. With the wind's augmentation, Ao Tian encountered virtually no obstruction, sweeping through the tree trunk. The simple light flashed again, and Nian Bing swung another strike backhanded. The tree fell. A section of trunk, about one chi long and one chi in diameter, landed in Nian Bing's hand. His mind seemed completely immersed in this tree trunk; he didn't even notice Hilarod and his daughter walk back to his side.\n\nJust as Mao Mao was about to speak to Nian Bing, Hilarod stopped her. He whispered to his daughter, \"Don't disturb him, he seems to have comprehended something.\"\n\nA flash of azure light streaked by, and the bark peeled off the tree trunk. Nian Bing flicked his wrist, sending the Ao Tian Blade back into his spatial realm. The next moment, the Ghost Sculpture appeared in his hand. The grain of the tree trunk was now perfectly clear to him. He began to carve. A deep blue light shimmered in his hand, and wood shavings flew everywhere. Nian Bing softly chanted, \"Where the ghost hand descends, a heavens-shaking change; carved into a hundred swirling waves. Divine craftsmanship from a thousand ages, now present; the blade rises, a crescent moon reflected in a cold spring.\" His movements appeared very elegant, seemingly slow. The deep blue light swirled around the wooden block like smoke. However, Hilarod, whose mental power was exceptionally strong, clearly perceived that with every ripple of the dreamlike, illusory smoke, at least dozens of blue rays struck the wooden block.\n\nFinally, the deep blue light vanished. The Ghost Sculpture lay quietly in Nian Bing's hand, while his other hand held his newly completed work. It was a dragon, a dragon identical to Karodylis, even its dragon scales were indistinguishable. The pose captured was exactly that of Karodylis earlier, with all four claws spread wide as it descended. Its huge wings were fully extended to both sides. The most exquisite part of the carving was the Azure Dragon Karodylis's eyes; it seemed that even the gaze was replicated in this sculpture. If it weren't for the fact that it lacked life, this was simply a miniature, magnificent giant dragon possessing both form and spirit!\n\n\"Ghost Sculpture, Divine Blade! What a Ghost Sculpture, Divine Blade! For your blade work to reach such a realm, I truly believe you are a chef now.\" Hilarod had seen everything in the world, yet he couldn't help but marvel at Nian Bing's divine touch.\n\nNian Bing came back to his senses and said somewhat awkwardly, \"I'm truly sorry. When I first learned culinary arts, my specialty in carving was dragons. However, I always felt that what I carved only had the dragon's form but not its essence. Earlier, seeing the giant dragon summoned by Senior, I suddenly couldn't suppress the excitement in my heart, which is why I carved this piece.\"\n\nHilarod walked up to Nian Bing and said approvingly, \"In such a short time, you were able to capture Karodylis's form and spirit. This shows you have profound attainment in mental power.\"\n\nNian Bing handed the carved wooden dragon in his hand to Mao Mao, who was beside him, her face full of curiosity. \"You're going home soon. Consider this a gift from your big brother.\"\n\nMao Mao excitedly took the wooden dragon into her hands. \"It's awesome, Big Brother! So you have this skill too.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"There's another gift. Although it might not be truly useful, there are benefits to carrying it.\" As he spoke, he took out the two fangs from the earlier musk deer from his bosom. The Ghost Sculpture flashed repeatedly, and the insides of the fangs were immediately hollowed out. He carefully inserted musk into them before handing them to Mao Mao. \"After you go back, seal them with wax. If you ever get a cut anywhere, just rub the wound with a yellowed musk fang, and it won't get infected. If you're bitten by a poisonous insect, draw circles around the wound with the musk fang, and the poison won't spread. But remember, it must wait until the musk fangs have turned completely yellow to have those properties. The musk fangs themselves will emit a faint fragrance, and I think you'll like it.\"\n\nMao Mao looked at the two five-inch long musk fangs in her hand. Something seemed to have deepened in her nimble, large eyes. \"Big Brother, why are you so good to Mao Mao? Mao Mao really loves your gifts.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"You've called me 'Big Brother' so many times, you shouldn't have called for nothing! Big Brother doesn't have many good things, so I can only give these to you.\"\n\nHilarod smiled slightly. \"It seems your luck is indeed quite good. Na Na truly lives up to its name as a Treasure-Attracting Fox. Although its urine smells unpleasant, it can attract rare animals. Once these musk fangs are prepared, they are worth more than fifty purple-gold coins, and they have a price but no market.**\"\n\nIt was Nian Bing's first time seeing such a gentle smile on Hilarod's face. At this moment, he no longer resembled a cold-faced summoner but more like an elder. Just as Nian Bing thought Hilarod was about to take Mao Mao away, Hilarod, instead, pulled Mao Mao back to their previous spot and sat down, then waved to Nian Bing, saying, \"Do you want to hear the story about that Golden-backed Earth Dragon?\"\n\nDriven by curiosity, Nian Bing walked over and sat down beside Hilarod and his daughter. Hilarod continued, \"Even I didn't expect you to encounter a Thousand-Year Earth Dragon. In records across the continent, there are only legendary accounts of creatures like dragons. But in fact, while dragons are powerful, they are still just a type of creature on the continent—only the strongest kind. Thousands of years ago, during the Great Ancient War, the continent had over a thousand giant dragons. Back then, nations prided themselves on having Dragon Warriors, because dragons represented power. Whichever side had more Dragon Warriors had a much greater chance of winning. However, as time passed, the number of dragons gradually decreased. Although they are the strongest creatures, reproduction is very difficult for them, especially the hatching of dragon eggs. The rarer their numbers became, the more precious giant dragons seemed. Dragons are a proud race; they would never ask humans for help, because they always believed humans represented selfishness. The reason they helped humans fight was precisely because they wanted to understand humans, the fastest reproducing creatures, to enhance their own reproductive capabilities. But after the war, they were disappointed. Dragons, after all, are not humans; their different physical structures made it impossible for them to possess the same rapid reproductive ability as humans. When the number of giant dragons fell below a hundred, the Dragon King at the time knew its race was on the verge of extinction. In desperation, it could only sacrifice its own life to use the most powerful Dragon Language Magic to call for help from the legendary Dragon God. Just as the ritual was about to be completed, a flaw appeared in the Dragon King's Dragon Language Magic. A selfish giant dragon, who wanted to usurp the Dragon King's position, launched an attack on him. It was at this moment that my ancestor, who had always been on good terms with the Dragon Clan, sacrificed his own life and burned all his mental power to stop that giant dragon. Only then did the Dragon King complete the forbidden spell within Dragon Language Magic—the Prayer of the Dragon God.\"\n___\n*   The phrase \"反正也遠\" (fǎnzhèng yě yuǎn) literally translates to \"anyway, it's also far.\" In this context, Mao Mao's tone suggests a playful or determined resolve, implying \"since it's a distance anyway, we might as well go together.\"\n*   \"Clouds follow the dragon\" (雲從龍, yún cóng lóng) is an idiom often used to describe how extraordinary figures or events are accompanied by auspicious phenomena, or how great things draw in supporting elements.\n**   \"Have a price but no market\" (有價無市, yǒu jià wú shì) is an idiom describing something extremely valuable but impossible to buy because it is not available for sale.",

    "content": "At this point, a hint of sadness couldn't help but surface in Hilard's eyes. He sighed softly before continuing, \"The Dragon God truly descended. As one of the Chief Gods, the Dragon God's first act was to punish that traitor of the Dragon Race. At the same time, he ordered the Dragon King to lead the powerful Dragon Race back to the Divine Realm, to become permanent members of the Divine Realm. However, the Dragon King was reluctant to leave the Yangguang Continent, where the Dragon Race had lived for countless years. At its request, the Dragon God allowed one dragon of each element to remain living on the continent, but they were not to participate in the continent's wars again. And my ancestors, because they saved the Dragon Race, the Dragon God specially bestowed upon us the title of Dragon Guardians, permitting the most outstanding member of our clan in each generation to sign an equal contract with one of the dragons remaining on the continent, and to oversee the seven elemental dragons guarding the continent. In my generation, the one with whom I formed a contract is Rodrilis, the Wind Elemental Divine Dragon you just saw. As an adult dragon, he is already over five thousand years old. From a human perspective, he is almost invincible, unless a Divine Descent Art or the Divine Battle Aura of a peak Divine Master warrior can harm him. The seven elemental dragons each reside in different corners of the Yangguang Continent, and apart from themselves, no one knows the whereabouts of the other dragons. The Dragon God did not give them any tasks; on the continent, apart from not being able to participate in wars, they are completely free.\"\n\n\"Dad, I know all this already! Get to the point,\" Mao Mao urged impatiently.\n\nNian Bing's mind was as clear as a mirror. He knew that Hilard was divulging this secret lore to repay him for the gift he had given Mao Mao. For Hilard, this historical knowledge was exceptionally precious. As soon as he heard Mao Mao interrupt Hilard, he quickly said, \"Mao Mao, be good. Don't interrupt. Let the senior continue.\"\n\nStrangely enough, Mao Mao, who usually wouldn't listen to her parents, obediently shut her mouth the moment Nian Bing spoke. Not only did she stop talking, but not even a hint of displeasure appeared on her pretty face.\n\nHilard smiled meaningfully and continued, \"I'm getting to the main point now. On our continent, there are many different faiths. Among them, some people worship dragons, the strongest terrestrial creatures, and they have formed the Dragonfolk themselves. They claim to be dragon-human hybrids to outsiders, taking the dragons remaining on the continent as their totems, diligently cultivating themselves, hoping to gain the dragons' recognition. To my knowledge, although dragons are reclusive, they strongly dislike humans. To this day, the number of Dragonfolk who have truly gained a dragon's recognition is extremely small, just like the Phoenixfolk who take phoenixes as their totems. Dragons are treasures in their entirety. Therefore, there are also individuals who are the opposite of these dragon-worshipping Dragonfolk, calling themselves Dragon Slayers. However, very few of these individuals manage to amount to anything; setting aside whether they can even find a dragon, the Dragonfolk alone are enough to give them a hard time.\"\n\nNian Bing asked, somewhat puzzled, \"Senior, can dragons really only be restrained by a Divine Descent Art and a Divine Master's Divine Battle Aura? If that's the case, then if a dragon ever wished to harm humans, and the legendary Dragon God didn't intervene, wouldn't humanity be in dire straits?\"\n\nHilard smiled slightly and said, \"Theoretically, that possibility exists, but it's very small. Although dragons are powerful, they also have their weaknesses. To deal with them when one's strength is insufficient, one can only succeed by finding dragon-slaying weapons. However, dragon-slaying artifacts are extremely rare; those things, similar to cursed magical items, are almost lost. Alright, that's enough for the previous story. We should talk about today's Gold-backed Earth Dragon. I don't know if you were extremely unlucky or incredibly fortunate, but the Gold-backed Earth Dragon you attracted today is not only an evolution from an Iron-backed Earth Dragon, but also the King of Gold-backed Earth Dragons. Through my recent mental communication with Rodrilis, I learned that this Gold-backed Earth Dragon is already over a thousand years old. Ordinary Earth Dragons generally don't live past two hundred years. If they encounter special circumstances and live beyond three hundred years, there's a twenty percent chance they will evolve into a Gold-backed Earth Dragon. Gold-backed Earth Dragons, whether in attack or defense, are far superior to common Iron-backed Earth Dragons, which is why your Ice-Fire Co-origin Magic couldn't harm it. Gold-backed Earth Dragons generally live up to five hundred years. The one you just saw must have consumed some kind of rare celestial treasure or spiritual medicine, or perhaps, despite its limited intelligence, comprehended a certain cultivation method, managing to live over a thousand years. It is absolutely a well-deserved King of Gold-backed Earth Dragons. Perhaps you don't think it's strong enough, but that's because you haven't fought it head-on. With its inherent abilities, even a fully equipped thousand-man heavy cavalry regiment would absolutely be unable to contend with it. Its weakness lies in its inability to fly and its innate fear of airborne creatures. That's why you were able to hold on for so long.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"So, the change in its appearance just now, was that the evolution Mao Mao mentioned? What are the characteristics of an evolved King of Gold-backed Earth Dragons?\"\n\nHilard said, \"Perhaps you've also heard an ancient saying that has been passed down: 'Golden scales are not things of the pond; once they meet the wind and clouds, they transform into dragons.' This refers to a type of fish, a fish possessing dragon bloodline. If, under certain circumstances, this fish can activate the dragon脉¹ within its body and use the Qi of heaven and earth to purify itself of impurities, it might become a true Divine Dragon. The King of Gold-backed Earth Dragons you just saw is in the same situation. On the continent, there are quite a few creatures that possess a small portion of dragon bloodline, and this Earth Dragon is one of them. But I never imagined this Earth Dragon could live to be a thousand years old and enter the final stage of its draconic transformation while under my mental magic confinement. The change you just witnessed was its process of transforming into a dragon. However, whether it can truly transform into a Divine Dragon is still unknown. I summoned Rodrilis not to deal with it, but to help it become a true Divine Dragon. By having Rodrilis make it submit, its evolution process will become perfect with the help of a true Divine Dragon. Once it becomes a Divine Dragon, it will no longer belong to the Earth Dragon category. As for what elemental abilities it possesses, that can only be seen after it fully evolves. This evolution process will likely take at least a year. I had Rodrilis tell it that as long as it is willing to pledge allegiance to my family for a hundred years, it can be thoroughly transformed into a dragon and officially join the Dragon Race. Having no other choice, it has agreed. From its nine divided tails and the spear-shaped dorsal fins erect on its back, I plan to call it the Nine-Glaive Dragon. As long as Mao Mao forms a contract with it, I won't have to worry so much even if that girl runs off again in the future.\"\n\n\"Hooray! Dad is the best!\" Mao Mao leaped up excitedly, wrapping her arms around Hilard's neck and kissing his cheek.\n\nHilard deliberately put on a stern face and said, \"Don't get too pleased with yourself yet. Do you think your current mental power is enough to form a contract with a Divine Dragon? If you want to become a Dragon Summoner, go back and properly cultivate your mental magic. If you can't grasp such a good opportunity, then don't ever say you're Hilard's daughter again.\"\n\nLooking at her father's severe expression, Mao Mao giggled, playfully stuck out her cute little tongue, and said, \"I know, I'll go back and work hard on cultivating. Dad, can we take Brother Nian Bing back with us? His cooking is really, really delicious! Mao Mao gets so lonely all by herself; if Brother Nian Bing comes along, I promise I won't run off anymore.\"\n\nHearing Mao Mao say that, Hilard's expression instantly changed drastically. This time, he seemed truly angry. He snapped, \"Haven't you caused enough trouble²? And you dare to bargain with me, Xiao Qing.\" With a flash of light, the giant azure bird appeared out of nowhere. Through mental communication, it immediately understood Hilard's meaning. It lowered its head, letting Mao Mao step onto its back.\n\nMao Mao's eyes reddened. \"Dad is so mean, so fierce! Nian Bing, it seems we really have to part. Here's one of these musk teeth for you. When you see it in the future, just imagine you're seeing Mao Mao. Don't worry, Mao Mao will definitely find you again!\" As she spoke, she tossed a musk tooth to Nian Bing.\n\nHilard frowned, and a cold glint flashed in his eyes. The giant azure bird hastily flapped its wings and flew away with Mao Mao.\n\nNian Bing said, \"Senior, Mao Mao is still a child. She's just a bit playful; please don't blame her.\"\n\nLooking at the gradually ascending azure bird, a trace of worry appeared in Hilard's eyes. \"To be frank, killing you right now would be the best option, but I've already made my statement beforehand, so consider yourself lucky.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment, looking at Hilard, whose expression had suddenly changed. He somewhat didn't understand his meaning. \"Senior, you...\"\n\nHilard snorted coldly and said, \"I hope you never see my daughter again. Otherwise, the next time we meet, it won't be so easy. We Bai people can only marry Bai people; this ensures the purity of our bloodline. Especially my daughter, if she cannot marry a Bai person, how will the Divine Dragon Guardian legacy be passed on?\"\n\nHearing this, Nian Bing said, somewhat dumbfounded, \"Senior, you're not mistaken, are you? Setting aside that Mao Mao and I have only known each other for a few hours, just the fact that I regard her as a sister makes such a thing impossible!\"\n\nA profound light gleamed in Hilard's eyes. \"I know my daughter best. You can treat her as a sister, and she, still ignorant of matters between men and women, will also treat you as a brother. However, everything you've done has left too deep an impression on her. Who can say what will happen in the future? Remember my words: if you want to spread the Ice-Fire Co-origin Magic far and wide, and live safely, then do not have any further involvement with my daughter.\" As he spoke the last few words, Nian Bing felt his mental power tremble violently, intense pain shot through his brain, his entire body shook, and he instantly lost consciousness.\n\nWhen Nian Bing regained consciousness, his surroundings had turned completely dark. The dizziness brought on by weakness made his mind hazy. He steadied himself and recalled everything that had happened before he fainted. Even now, he found it somewhat hard to believe. Looking around, he saw that the remaining roasted musk deer meat was still there; it seemed all of it was real. Mao Mao's father was actually such a powerful being. He couldn't help but wonder why, after leaving the Peach Blossom Forest, every girl he met seemed to have a father more powerful than the last. A magician who could summon a Divine Dragon was probably a match even for his newly recognized teacher, Long Zhi, wasn't he? After all, without the strength of a Divine Descender, magic couldn't harm dragons. It seemed the path he had to travel to avenge his parents was still very, very long.\n\nPropping himself up with both hands, Nian Bing moved to a nearby tree and sat down. Although Mao Mao and her father had caused Nian Bing considerable trouble, and even danger, learning about dragons from the Dragon Summoner Hilard still excited him. Nian Bing even felt a bit envious of the Bai people now; if one could summon a dragon, what use was practicing magic then?\n\nForcefully shaking off this tempting thought from his mind, he activated his Spatial Ring, took out three of the few remaining magic scrolls, spread them out in front of him, and connected them with a simple Touch Magic Array. Although these were only fourth-tier scrolls, they were sufficient for dealing with ordinary beasts. As long as it wasn't some kind of Earth Dragon, there should be no problem.\n\nScrolls could be used without chanting spells, which was indeed very convenient. However, Nian Bing's simple calculation of the value of the scrolls he had previously used gave him the urge to strangle himself—how many Purple Gold Coins would that be! Never mind. He decided it would be better to make fewer scrolls in the future. Constantly relying on them would likely significantly slow down his magic improvement rate.\n\nAs his mood gradually calmed, Nian Bing closed his eyes, sensing the magic elements in the surrounding air, and entered a state of meditation. The most important thing currently was undoubtedly to first recover his strength. Mao Mao was gone, and he had regained his freedom. Although being alone was lonely, Nian Bing preferred this solitude.\n\nWith the help of the Stone of the Fire God and the Stone of the Ice Goddess, a night of meditation had restored eighty percent of Nian Bing's Ice-Fire Co-origin magical power. He only needed to absorb fewer magic elements from the air while walking, and he would soon return to his peak condition. As for the used scrolls, he couldn't replenish them himself; he would have to buy some blank scrolls in the next large city. Unfortunately, Mao Mao had taken quite a bit of his money, so he'd probably have to start by buying the most common blank scrolls, then try to buy a few low-tier magic scrolls to get more money before buying better ones.\n\nHe simply roasted the remaining musk deer meat with Flame Art and ate it, then consumed a piece of ice formed by Ice Art. Nian Bing then resumed his journey of tempering.\n\nWalking alone might be lonely for an ordinary person, but such a situation would not occur for Nian Bing. Having set his direction, he walked while recalling the magical knowledge from the library in his mind, understanding it in his own way, and thus, he was not lonely on his journey.\n\n---\n¹ **dragon脉 (lóngmài)**: Literally \"dragon pulse\" or \"dragon vein.\" In fantasy contexts, it refers to an inherent bloodline or energy channel that grants a being draconic power or potential.\n² **你泡的還不夠麼？(nǐ pào de hái bù gòu me?)**: Literally \"Have you soaked enough?\" This is an idiom meaning \"Have you caused enough trouble?\" or \"Haven't you indulged enough?\"",

    "content": "It was already September, and the air, originally hot and dry, gradually turned cool and refreshing. Autumn was the season of harvest. Along the roadsides of the Ice Moon Empire, besides various plants, were commoners' cultivated crops. Under the sun's illumination, the air became even fresher. Although the direct sunlight was strong, walking in the shade of the trees felt cool and comfortable.\n\nIce Orchid City, a major city connecting the borders of the Ice Moon Empire and the Orland Empire, was also one of the most peculiar cities on the entire Yangguang Continent. This was because two-thirds of the city lay within the Ice Moon Empire's territory, while the remaining one-third belonged to the Orland Empire. When the territory was originally demarcated, it was unknown how they made the distinction. Fortunately, the Ice Moon Empire had always been on good terms with the Orland Empire; the city was governed by the Ice Moon Empire, but a small annual tax had to be paid to the Orland Empire.\n\nAs Ice Orchid City straddled the lands of two great empires, it became the largest transportation and commercial hub in the surrounding area. The city's scale was comparable to the Ice Moon Empire's second largest city, Ice Snow City, and was even much more bustling. Orland Empire citizens and Ice Moon Empire citizens moved ceaselessly through the city, the largest groups being merchants. The Ice Moon Empire and the Orland Empire had always engaged in trade; shrewd merchants would cross-buy and sell goods between the two nations, thus gaining greater profits. With merchants, naturally, another group could not be absent: mercenaries. To maximize profits, merchants often transported goods over long distances; therefore, hiring mercenaries for protection became indispensable. After all, no merchant wanted their hard-earned goods to encounter problems on the road.\n\nMagicians had their Magician Guild, and mercenaries also had their own Mercenary Guild. It was just that the Mercenary Guild was not as noble as the Magician Guild; in the eyes of common people, it was merely a gathering place for those low-level warriors. Various tasks could be accepted from the Mercenary Guild, with different rewards based on task difficulty. There were few exceptionally skilled warriors among mercenaries. After all, if one's martial skills reached a certain level, why would they still be a mercenary? Many better options awaited them.\n\nThe Mercenary Guild of Ice Orchid City was located on the northernmost side of the city, very close to the city gates. The guild's building was not tall, but its footprint was very large. In the spacious guild hall, spanning several thousand square meters, at least seven to eight hundred mercenaries were gathered at this moment. Some came to accept tasks individually, others as mercenary groups, but their goal was indeed the same: to earn money. If they could find a task that was both simple and easy to complete, then the mercenaries could live comfortably for a while.\n\nOf course, not all mercenaries aimed solely to earn money. While such people were few in number, they did exist. Their purposes included traveling or a love for adventure. Although they were a minority, it was precisely among this minority that the strongest mercenaries could be found.\n\n\"I saw this task first! Is your Blazing Flame Mercenary Group trying to bully us and snatch it away?\" A mercenary, not tall but corpulent like a ball, roared furiously. His voice was absolutely inverse to his height; this single shout almost echoed through the entire guild hall. Instantly, mercenaries, who inherently loved a good spectacle, all cast various glances his way. The short fat man's physique looked somewhat comical. Simply put, his whole body was like a meatball placed on a lump of fat, round everywhere. The loose clothes he wore no longer looked like warrior's attire. From the white shield-shaped mercenary emblem with two crossed swords on his chest, judging by its color, he was merely an ordinary Rank Four mercenary.\n\nMercenary ranks, from highest to lowest, were classified as Special Rank, Rank One, Rank Two, Rank Three, Rank Four, Rank Five, and Apprentice Mercenary. Their emblems were all the same: a shield with two crossed longswords. However, depending on the rank, from highest to lowest, the emblem colors were gold, silver, red, purple, yellow, white, blue, and grey (the color of the metal itself).\n\n\"Yes, we're bullying you. So what? Shorty-ball, roll on home. With your looks, you think you can complete a task? I bet you'd eat the employer out of house and home before you're even halfway there.\" A tall mercenary, dressed in blue warrior's attire, said dismissively. From his appearance, he looked more like a mercenary.\n\nThe short, fat mercenary's entire body of fat quivered in anger. \"You—you dare! This is the Mercenary Guild, not your Blazing Flame Mercenary Group! By what right do you snatch the task I was about to accept? The Guild will uphold justice, won't it, beautiful lady?\" As he spoke, his gaze fell upon the lady in charge behind the Mercenary Guild counter.\n\nIn the guild hall, there were at least thirty counters responsible for assigning tasks. On the huge blackboard behind the counters, tasks of various ranks and their requirements were clearly written. Regardless of which counter, one could accept and complete tasks by their respective numbers. If a task remained unaccepted for three months and the employer was unwilling to give up, then the task's rank would automatically increase by one level. These task ranks were exactly the same as mercenary ranks, but that didn't mean a Rank Three mercenary could necessarily complete a Rank Three task; tasks of the same rank were only similar in difficulty, never identical.\n\nThe lady in charge behind the counter appeared to be twenty-five or twenty-six years old, with an ordinary face. Her uniform outlined her graceful figure, making her seem quite buxom. She glanced at the short fat man impatiently and said, \"The Guild will naturally uphold justice, however, although you intended to accept this task just now, you hesitated throughout and did not finalize your confirmation. Therefore, the Blazing Flame Mercenary Group is not considered to be bullying you. Frankly, with your strength as a Rank Four mercenary, it would be very difficult to complete this Rank Three task. Don't cause a scene here; please leave. As for the one from the Blazing Flame Mercenary Group, you may proceed with the registration procedure.\"\n\n\"Bullshit! I clearly accepted the task first! You little hussy must be his paramour! Damn it, I'm taking this task today, no matter what!\" The short fat man's face was flushed crimson with anger; his right hand slapped the counter forcefully, producing a loud thud.\n\nThe mercenary from the Blazing Flame Mercenary Group had a yellow emblem on his chest, representing a Rank Three mercenary. He extended his large, fan-like hand and pressed it onto the short fat man's shoulder. \"Go make trouble somewhere else; don't interfere with my task registration.\"\n\nThe short fat man slapped his hand away. \"Get lost! This task is mine!\"\n\nAmong mercenaries, there were inherently dragons and snakes mixed together*. The member of the Blazing Flame Mercenary Group, seeing that his opponent, who was of a lower rank than himself, was still so arrogant, immediately felt his anger surge. \"What? You want a fight, huh? I'll beat you to death, you fat pig!\"\n\nThe lady in charge behind the counter snorted, saying, \"If you want to fight, take it outside. Otherwise, I'll call the guards.\"\n\nUpon hearing the word 'guards,' the previously arrogant fat man and the grim-faced Blazing Flame Mercenary Group member immediately changed their expressions. The fat man muttered a few curses under his breath, then sheepishly squeezed through the crowd and headed outside. Meanwhile, the member of the Blazing Flame Mercenary Group obediently began to register the task.\n\nMercenary ranks were determined by the difficulty and number of tasks completed. Thus, even a Rank Three mercenary might not necessarily possess the strength of an Advanced Warrior; most were merely ordinary warriors. However, the guards employed by this Mercenary Guild all possessed at least the strength of Advanced Warriors, and there were even Sword Master-level experts among them. They would absolutely show no mercy to mercenaries who dared to cause trouble here; as long as the guards took action, broken bones and torn tendons were a common occurrence. Therefore, although mercenaries frequently had conflicts, they absolutely dared not provoke the guards within the Guild.\n\nSeeing that the commotion had passed, the mercenaries who had gathered there dispersed to attend to their own affairs. The lady in charge snorted. She had seen this situation countless times. Picking up the pen from the table, she slowly registered the burly man from the Blazing Flame Mercenary Group.\n\n\"Excuse me, are there any tasks here requesting high-level magic scrolls?\" A clear voice sounded in front of the counter.\n\nThe lady in charge finished a few strokes of registration, handed the registration card to the Blazing Flame Mercenary Group member, and at the same time said impatiently, \"Can't you look for tasks yourself? Why ask?\" As she spoke, she looked up. When she saw the person who was asking her, her previously impatient eyes suddenly sparkled, as if heart shapes could be seen in her gaze.\n\nStanding in front of the counter was a very tall man. Although his physique was not as exaggerated as the burly man from the Blazing Flame Mercenary Group, his build was slender and well-proportioned. A head of golden-blonde hair fell loosely down his back, and deep blue eyes, like the ocean, radiated the light of wisdom. He appeared to be only around twenty years old, and his handsomeness was such that even women would envy it. Upon hearing the lady in charge's words, he couldn't help but slightly frown, and his gaze swept towards the blackboard behind her.\n\nThe lady in charge coughed, barely managing to suppress her excited feelings. \"Sir, esteemed sir, are you here to accept a task?\"\n\nThe golden-haired young man was Nian Bing. Hearing her, he refocused his gaze on the lady in charge's face, nodded, and said, \"Yes, I'd like to see if there are any tasks here for purchasing magic scrolls of Rank Five or higher.\" After ten days of trekking and occasional blizzard flights, Nian Bing finally arrived at Ice Orchid City, which bordered the Ice Moon Empire and the Orland Empire. Upon entering the city, his first act was to buy a detailed map of the continent. For the past ten days, if not for flying and asking for directions to find the correct path, he wouldn't have known how much he had detoured.\n\nAs soon as he arrived in Ice Orchid City, Nian Bing first thought of replenishing his supply of magic scrolls. He counted, and only had twenty-odd purple gold coins on him, which was enough to buy ordinary scrolls. However, when creating the kind of triggered magic scrolls that could use dual magic and achieve the effect of ice and fire from the same source, he had to use the best scrolls to have a certain success rate. The money he had was clearly not enough, so he wanted to sell a few scrolls for cash. Of course, he had also looked for a branch of the Ice Moon Empire's Magician Guild here. Unfortunately, due to Ice Orchid City bordering the Orland Empire, there was no Magician Guild branch present. Of course, the absence of a branch also related to the decline of the Ice Moon Empire's Magician Guild.\n\nLeft with no choice, he could only go to magic shops to sell his scrolls. However, because the scrolls he made were different from ordinary magic scrolls—those Rank Four to Rank Six scrolls were special scrolls that could release their power simply by being opened, without magic guidance—they naturally couldn't be easily verified by others. As for those that weren't special scrolls but were fusion magic scrolls, how could the magic arrays inscribed on them be understood by mere magic merchants? Nian Bing wanted to use a scroll to demonstrate his power, but the scrolls were so valuable that he truly couldn't bear to part with one, finding himself in a difficult and awkward situation. He tried several magic item shops consecutively, but received the same answer. Finally, a somewhat kind shop owner directed him to the Mercenary Guild to try his luck. If he could find a task here to buy magic scrolls, he wouldn't have to worry about selling them, as buyers were often willing to pay to test the scrolls' power. Left with no choice, Nian Bing asked for directions and came here, hoping to find a suitable task to earn money.\n\nNian Bing had witnessed the previous scene entirely, and the low-quality mercenaries left a bad first impression on him.\n\nThe lady in charge looked at the handsome Nian Bing, a smile appearing on her face, and the 'peach blossoms' in her eyes couldn't help but bloom pink. \"Too handsome, truly too handsome! Sir, would you please wait a moment? I'll check for you. My name is Marie, and it's a pleasure to serve you.\"\n\n\"Oh, look at that, girls really love handsome men! Marie's acting flirtatious today, why have I never received such treatment?!\" A Rank Three mercenary, over forty years old, said in a sarcastic tone from nearby.\n\nMarie, being in this place where dragons and snakes mixed together every day, had seen a lot. She snorted, saying, \"Get lost! Don't chatter so much around me. If you have the ability, once you've been promoted to a Rank One mercenary, I'll find tasks for you too.\"\n\nThe forty-something middle-aged man's gaze fell on Nian Bing. \"So that means he's a Rank One mercenary? He doesn't look like it to me.\"\n\nNian Bing impatiently glanced at the meddling person beside him; the lewd smile on the other's face clearly showed disdain for him. He couldn't be bothered to pay attention to such a person and redirected his gaze to Marie.\n\nSeeing that Nian Bing didn't speak, the middle-aged man escalated, placing his hand on Nian Bing's shoulder. \"Hey kid, looking at you, you must be a male prostitute, right? I've never seen you here before. Business bad, so you came here to pick up women? Marie's actually a good choice, look at her figure, truly hot! But her meager salary probably won't satisfy you. Want me to introduce you to a better prospect? The noblewomen in the city just love cream-faced pretty boys like you. Ah, heaven really isn't fair! Why couldn't I be a bit handsomer? Kid, your mom must be really pretty, huh, hehe.\" His lewd laughter instantly sent the surrounding mercenaries into a roar of laughter.\n\n---\n*   *Dragons and snakes mixed together*: An idiom implying a motley crew or a place where people of all kinds, both good and bad, are found.",

    "content": "Nian Bing was a smart person. Having experienced everything that happened in Ice Snow City, he absolutely didn't want any trouble. If the other party had merely insulted him, at most he would have regarded them as an annoying fly. However, the middle-aged man insulted his mother, and that was Nian Bing's most painful wound. In an instant, Nian Bing's gaze changed, but a smile appeared on his face.\n\nThe middle-aged man suddenly felt a chill run through him, an inexplicable coldness in his heart. \"What the hell are you laughing at?\"¹ To conceal the trace of fear rising in his heart, he lifted the hand that was resting on Nian Bing's shoulder and slapped it towards his face.\n\n\"Laugh at your father.\" An azure glow flashed like mist. Amidst the splattering blood, an ear-piercing scream, like a pig being slaughtered, rang out in the Mercenary Guild.\n\nA hand, still twitching, dropped to the ground. The middle-aged man let out a shriek of agony, clutching his wrist from which blood spurted wildly. His face instantly turned pale, his legs gave way, and he immediately fell to the ground, howling incessantly.\n\nNian Bing kicked the severed hand aside, still looking at Marie as if nothing had happened. In a direct confrontation, Nian Bing couldn't defeat a third-tier mercenary, but his knife was too fast. Ghost Carving had merged with his hand years ago, and with lightning-fast knife skills combined with the blade's sharpness, he could accomplish many things by surprise.\n\nSilence, an unusual silence. The entire Mercenary Guild was enveloped in a dead stillness. The cruel and ruthless act instantly shocked everyone present. Marie stared blankly at the handsome man before her, her hands already trembling.\n\nNian Bing's voice remained gentle, reminding Marie, \"Miss, please continue searching. Thank you.\"\n\nHis gentle voice was so clear in the hall. Just now, almost no one saw what he did; only a small knife had appeared in his right hand. The small knife, shimmering with blue light, was spinning between his fingertips.\n\n\"You, how could you injure someone in the Guild?\" Marie's voice was clearly trembling.\n\nNian Bing's face revealed a roguish smile. \"Did I injure anyone? Are you sure you saw it?\"\n\nMarie froze for a moment. In her heart, she also couldn't believe Nian Bing had done that just now, but the facts were before her eyes. Nian Bing's smile made her feel a chill in her heart, so cold it seemed to freeze. It was as if the handsome young man before her was no longer a person, but a devil, a murdering devil. \"Someone! Guards! Quick, someone!\" Marie screamed hysterically, the terror in her heart causing her to stumble back several steps, tripping over a chair and falling to the ground.\n\nNian Bing frowned, turning to look at the middle-aged man with the severed hand. As expected of a third-tier mercenary, he had some knowledge of treating injuries. At this moment, he was desperately pinching his own wrist, trying to prevent excessive blood loss.\n\nThe crowd of mercenaries automatically parted. Three guards in black warrior uniforms walked over. Seeing the situation, all three of their expressions changed simultaneously. The leader, a warrior in his thirties, frowned as he looked at Nian Bing. \"I'm the security captain here. Did you do this?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, not answering his question. Instead, he crouched down and asked the middle-aged man with the severed hand, \"Did I cut off your hand?\" His smile was gentle, but just as Marie had felt earlier, what the middle-aged man saw was a devilish smile. His body trembled slightly, and his pale face, due to excessive blood loss, had a greenish tint. He desperately shook his head, \"No, no, no, it wasn't.\"\n\nNian Bing stood up, looking somewhat provocatively at the security captain. \"He's lying. I did do it, because he insulted my mother.\" His left leg took a sudden step forward, and his right leg swung in a full circle with all his might, kicking the face of the forty-something middle-aged man. Instantly, the middle-aged man didn't even have time to scream before he fainted amidst splashing blood.\n\nThe security captain didn't stop Nian Bing, but his gaze turned cold. \"Kid, you're very arrogant. You need to understand where you are right now.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly. \"I understand. Isn't this the Mercenary Guild?\"\n\nThe security captain snorted coldly. \"Then I'll reclaim the mercenaries' dignity.\"\n\nNian Bing pointed his right index finger at the unconscious middle-aged man. \"Someone like him still has dignity?\"\n\nWhite battle qi emanated from the security captain. The ability to use battle qi proved that he had entered the realm of a Swordsman Master. On the surface, this security captain's strength was definitely not inferior to Xue Jing's.\n\n\"You'll end up just like him.\" The security captain raised a hand, and the surrounding mercenaries immediately cleared a space for them.\n\nNian Bing shook his head at the security captain, extending his right hand. A fireball instantly appeared in his palm. \"Since you're so confident, then come. However, I can't guarantee I won't accidentally injure others.\"\n\nSeeing the flames in Nian Bing's hand, the security captain's expression instantly changed. He said in surprise, \"You are a Magician?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"To be precise, I should be a Magician from the Ice Moon Empire Magician Guild.\"\n\nWas the security captain afraid of Magicians? No, he was definitely not. He didn't believe the young man's magic could be stronger than his own martial arts. However, while Magicians didn't have an advantage in one-on-one combat against warriors, due to their scarcity, Magicians held a much higher status than warriors and were targets for various nations to win over. Especially when he heard Nian Bing say he was a member of the Magician Guild, his hesitation vanished. As the saying goes, *even a starved camel is bigger than a horse*,² and even if the Ice Moon Empire Magician Guild was weak, it was still a Magician Guild. That was absolutely something a lower-tier guild like the Mercenary Guild couldn't afford to provoke.\n\n\"My apologies, respected Magician Sir. I had originally thought you were also a mercenary. Please forgive my rudeness.\" The security captain dispersed his battle qi and respectfully said to Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing didn't wish to reveal more of his identity, but to avoid trouble, this was the best choice. He smiled calmly, pointed at the middle-aged man on the ground, and said, \"If you don't want him to die, carry him away.\"\n\nThe security captain turned and gave a look to his subordinate guards. Two guards quickly stepped forward, lifted the unconscious middle-aged man, and left. Looking at Nian Bing with some doubt, the security captain said, \"Magician Sir, since you are a member of our nation's Magician Guild, could I ask you to show your credentials?\"\n\nNian Bing's brows furrowed slightly. \"Is that necessary?\"\n\nThe security captain glanced at Ghost Carving, held between Nian Bing's fingers, and nodded. \"I think it is necessary. I must provide an explanation to our Mercenary Guild.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly. \"This is what you want.\" With a flash of light, a token appeared in his right hand. It was the symbol of identity Long Zhi had just given him a few days before his departure.\n\nThe security captain took the token from Nian Bing's hand and examined it carefully. His expression instantly changed drastically. \"You, you are...\"\n\nNian Bing took the token back and returned it to his Spatial Ring. \"Don't say it aloud. It's enough that you understand. I'm here to find a suitable mission.\"\n\nThe security captain's face had now turned somewhat pale. Although he couldn't believe the young man before him was an Elder of the Magician Guild, the token was absolutely authentic. How could something from the Magician Guild be easily faked? After a moment of hesitation, he walked to the counter and said to Marie, \"Quickly help this Magician Sir find the mission he needs. Do not be slow.\" Leaving that instruction, he hurried away.\n\nThe surrounding mercenaries all fixed their gaze on Nian Bing. To be able to scare off the security captain, they knew this young man was definitely not simple, especially since he was also a Magician.\n\nMarie secretly glanced at Nian Bing, then hastily flipped through the Mercenary Guild's mission records. However, her hands were still trembling somewhat.\n\nNian Bing couldn't help but sigh inwardly. The strong prey on the weak was indeed the rule of society. Before Hilder, he was weak, but before these people, he had become the powerful one. It seemed that no matter where he went on the continent, there would be no peaceful days.\n\n\"Alright, I found it! There really is one.\" Marie picked up the mission record with a relieved sigh and said to Nian Bing, \"Magician Sir, the mission you're looking for is a bit unusual, but there truly is one here. The City Lord's Royal Guard needs clues for fifth-tier magic scrolls. The requirement is just a clue. A clue for one scroll is five gold coins, and for each tier higher, the mission reward doubles. It's a third-tier mission, and it's the kind that multiple people can accept simultaneously. Seventy-three mercenaries have accepted it so far, but only two have completed it, and both found fifth-tier scrolls.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart rejoiced. The City Lord's Royal Guard should be quite wealthy. Now he had a source of funds. He quickly asked, \"How can I contact the employer then?\"\n\n\"Well...\" Marie hesitated for a moment. \"After mercenaries complete this mission, they just need to hand it over to us, and we will contact the employer. Once we confirm the mission is completed correctly, we will pay the remuneration to the mercenary and deduct one-tenth as a handling fee. As for the employer's contact information, we need to keep it confidential.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly. \"In that case, just tell me the contact information. I can complete this mission.\"\n\nMarie was stunned for a moment. \"But, you're not a mercenary, let alone a member of this Guild. That's against the rules!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"That's simple.\" He turned his gaze to the surrounding mercenaries. The closest one to him was the burly man from the Lan Xing Mercenary Group who had just accepted a mission. After taking the mission, he hadn't left, but was instead watching the commotion. Nian Bing waved to him. \"Big brother, I'd like to ask you for a favor.\"\n\nThe burly man froze for a moment. He naturally knew that Magicians held noble status. \"Me? How can I help you?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"You accept this mission, and then you can directly collect the commission.\"\n\nThe burly man still didn't understand Nian Bing's meaning. \"Our mercenary group already accepted this mission long ago; we just haven't completed it yet.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Then you can turn in the mission now. I am the source of the magic scrolls. Miss Marie, does this comply with the rules this time? I'm staying at the Lan Xin Hotel not far from the Guild. When the employer arrives, tell them to come find me in room three-six-four there. Just say I have several scrolls above fifth-tier to sell.\" After explaining this, he nodded to the burly man and walked towards the door.\n\n\"Is Magician Sir looking to sell scrolls? Then why bother completing a mission?\" A low, resonant voice sounded. The hundreds of mercenaries in the hall scattered like a tide, forming a pathway. Nian Bing had just reached the doorway at this moment. Looking down the pathway, he saw a slender, clean-shaven old man walking towards him, with the security captain following closely behind him.\n\nNian Bing stopped and looked at the old man. Soon, the old man arrived before him, smiled faintly, and said, \"Magician Sir, I am the President of the local Mercenary Guild. May I have a word with you?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Of course. It's a pleasure to meet you, President.\" He knew that his identity must have drawn the President out. From his tone, it seemed he also had thoughts of purchasing magic scrolls. If he could sell them here, it would be even less trouble. Therefore, Nian Bing naturally wouldn't refuse his invitation.\n\nThe Mercenary Guild President made a gesture for Nian Bing to follow, leading him towards the back of the Guild. As they passed through the main hall and entered the Guild's rear chambers, the surroundings immediately became much quieter. The Mercenary Guild President stopped and said to the security captain, \"There's nothing for you here. Go about your business.\" The security captain acknowledged, then returned to the main hall.\n\n\"Magician Sir, please follow me.\" Saying this, the Mercenary Guild President continued to lead Nian Bing further inside. As they walked, Nian Bing observed his surroundings. This Mercenary Guild was connected front to back. His current location was a courtyard. The Guild's interior decoration was extremely simple, with everything focused on simplicity and practicality.\n\nUnder the Mercenary Guild President's lead, Nian Bing followed him into a large office at the back of the Guild.\n\n\"Magician Sir, please have a seat. Let me introduce myself first. I am Carlo, the President of this Guild. I just heard the security captain say that you are actually an Elder of our nation's Magician Guild. Such a distinguished guest gracing us with your presence, I truly apologize for not having welcomed you properly.\"³\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"President Sir, there's no need to be so polite. Actually, I am merely a High-level Magician, but because my master is the President of the Magician Guild, he granted me the status of an Elder to make it easier for me to travel outside.\" Allowing anyone to underestimate him was the best camouflage.\n\nCarlo's expression remained unchanged, as if he had already guessed it. \"For Magician Sir to reach the High-level Magician realm at such a young age is already very impressive. I just heard you say you have magic scrolls to sell? Rather than letting others get them cheap, why not sell them to me? The price is negotiable. May I know what tiers of magic scrolls you have? I'll buy them all.\"\n\n---\n¹ Translator's Note: A very blunt and aggressive insult, literally \"laugh at your mother, are you laughing?\". Nian Bing's response \"Laugh at your father\" is a direct retort, maintaining the blunt and provocative tone.\n² Translator's Note: A Chinese idiom (瘦死的駱駝比馬大 - shòusǐ de luòtuo bǐ mǎ dà), meaning that even something in decline or reduced in power still retains some inherent superiority over something smaller or weaker.\n³ Translator's Note: A polite idiom (有失遠迎 - yǒu shī yuǎn yíng), indicating one failed to go out to meet an important guest, expressing humility and respect.",

    "content": "Nian Bing looked at Carlo, who was dressed in plain clothes, with some doubt, saying, \"I will absolutely not compromise on the price.\"\n\nCarlo naturally understood his meaning, and smiled slightly, \"You can rest assured on that point. If I may say something arrogant, although our Mercenary Guild is only a low-level guild and receives no state funding, when it comes to money, I'm afraid your guild and the Warrior Guild combined can't compare to our Mercenary Guild. Although the commission we charge isn't much, the number of mercenaries in the Ice Moon Empire now exceeds thirty thousand. Even if each person only pays one copper coin in fees every day, it's still a considerable income for us.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred, and only then did he realize his error in thinking. Yes! Although the Mercenary Guild wasn't highly regarded, it was one of the largest guilds. Its mercenary population could be said to spread throughout the entire empire. Whether it was various news or resources, they were indeed not to be underestimated. Perhaps, in the future, he would have to rely on them to inquire about things. Thinking of this, the smile on his face immediately became friendlier. \"Guild Master Carlo, please don't misunderstand. I didn't mean anything else. It's just that I want to remind you that what I need is not money, or rather, not entirely money.\"\n\nCarlo smiled indifferently and said, \"Sir Mage, please state whatever requirements you have. As long as they are worth the value, I will do my best to fulfill them.\"\n\nNian Bing knew it was time to talk business. \"I currently have various magic scrolls in my possession. Among them are four Rank 4 scrolls, three Rank 5 scrolls, two Rank 6 scrolls, and some special scrolls. I need you to exchange them with scrolls as well, using the best white scrolls.\"\n\nUpon hearing Nian Bing say he wanted to exchange them for white scrolls, Carlo immediately laughed. \"That's too simple. With our guild's connections, I can certainly meet your requirements. Such common magical items circulate extensively in Ice Orchid City. However, I'd like to hear what exchange ratio you're planning. How about this? Since you're selling so many, I can acquire them at twenty percent above the market price, how about that? I'll take all these scrolls.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Then I'd like to hear your specific offer.\" He wasn't in a hurry to close the deal, as although he had some understanding of scroll prices, he wasn't entirely certain. His calm demeanor at this moment was naturally to secure the best possible profit.\n\nCarlo didn't rush to quote a price. He stood up and walked to the side to pour Nian Bing a cup of water. \"Sir Mage, please have some water first. According to market prices, a Rank 4 scroll varies in price from five to fifteen Purple Gold Coins, depending on the magic inscribed. Rank 5 scrolls are worth twenty to fifty Purple Gold Coins, and Rank 6 scrolls are generally priced between two hundred and five hundred Purple Gold Coins. Rest assured, as long as the scroll's magic is applicable, the price I offer will be absolutely fair. Generally speaking, offensive magic scrolls are relatively more expensive; you should be aware of this.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Very well, I'll also give you a price. Rank 4 magic scrolls: two hundred Purple Gold Coins each. Rank 5 magic scrolls: fifty Purple Gold Coins each. Rank 6 magic scrolls: four hundred Purple Gold Coins each. I believe this price is quite fair.\"\n\nUpon hearing Nian Bing's offer, Carlo immediately frowned. \"Sir Mage, I can understand your prices for the Rank 5 and Rank 6 magic scrolls, but why are the Rank 4 magic scrolls priced so high?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled indifferently and said, \"It's simple. Because you absolutely cannot buy these Rank 4 magic scrolls anywhere else. These are Trigger Magic Scrolls researched by my teacher, Grand Master Long Zhi, and currently, they have only been successfully tested on Rank 4 scrolls.\" The last sentence was true; due to the difficulty of creating Trigger Magic Scrolls, Nian Bing could only make Rank 4 magic scrolls with this trigger function for now. Moreover, the materials had to be the most precious white scrolls, each worth ten Purple Gold Coins.\n\nCarlo's heart stirred. \"Trigger Magic Scrolls, Sir Mage, could you please explain in more detail?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"There's no need for a detailed explanation; it's very simple. Anyone, as long as they carry this scroll on their person, will trigger the scroll at the instant an attack arrives. All four of these trigger scrolls are Fire Wall spells. A Rank 4 Fire Wall might not be very strong, but it's sufficient for saving a life. By 'anyone,' I mean anyone other than mages as well.\"\n\n\"What?\" Carlo exclaimed in surprise. He was always well-informed, and in his memory, this kind of special Trigger Magic Scroll seemed to have been lost long ago. If it truly was such a life-saving item, a price of two hundred Purple Gold Coins was indeed not expensive. To confirm his thoughts, he tentatively asked, \"Sir Mage, are you referring to the Trigger Magic Scroll famously known as the 'Assassin's Bane'?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Facts speak louder than words. As long as you are willing to take out two hundred Purple Gold Coins for a test, you will naturally know the answer. However, I do not wish for you to haggle with me. These scrolls I've offered are worth a total of one thousand seven hundred and fifty Purple Gold Coins. Please exchange one hundred and fifty high-grade white scrolls for me, and for the remainder, please exchange them for mid-grade scrolls at two hundred and fifty Purple Gold Coins each.\"\n\nCarlo composed himself and said, \"If your scrolls truly possess such miraculous effects, I will agree to all these requests. But to be safe, I still hope to test one of the Rank 4 scrolls you mentioned. Let's move to a different location.\"\n\nNian Bing thought to himself: This Mercenary Guild Master is truly wealthy and extravagant, two hundred Purple Gold Coins just for a test...\n\nThe two went into the courtyard. Nian Bing took a scroll from his Spatial Ring and threw it to Carlo. When Carlo saw that it was a magic scroll made from a high-grade white scroll, he already believed it a bit. After all, a common Rank 4 scroll was worth less than a high-grade white scroll. Using it to make a Rank 4 magic scroll showed the scroll's true value.\n\nNian Bing said, \"You can place the scroll anywhere on your person. I will now attack you with a spell, and you don't need to do anything. Oh, passionate fire elements! Please release your scorching flames, condense into spheres of destruction, flames of explosion, and annihilate everything before me! —Explosive Flame spell.\" As the incantation emerged, fire elements rapidly condensed around Nian Bing. In a moment, a Rank 3 Explosive Flame spell appeared in his hand. With a thought, the Explosive Flame spell sent a red ripple, surging towards Carlo. Under the sweep of the heatwave, the air subtly distorted.\n\nCarlo's eyes widened. This was, after all, an experiment worth two hundred Purple Gold Coins. Just as the Explosive Flame spell was about to strike his chest, a peculiar sensation appeared. Carlo clearly felt a warm current of air enveloping his entire body. The magic scroll he had just put into his bosom emitted a slight cracking sound, and a thick wall of flame appeared before him without any warning. A Rank 4 Fire Wall spell facing a Rank 3 Explosive Flame spell naturally posed no problem. The Explosive Flame spell was completely swallowed by the fire wall. The massive fire wall only slightly receded before returning to its normal state.\n\nThe fire wall continued to burn; the magic power imbued by the scroll was enough for it to withstand several of the opponent's attacks. With a flash of light and shadow, Carlo, his body shimmering with blue Combat Aura, bypassed the fire wall and appeared before Nian Bing. He didn't regret the two hundred Purple Gold Coins; his somewhat aged face was filled with excitement. \"It's incredible, truly incredible! Grand Master Long Zhi truly lives up to his name as the Mage Guild Master of the Empire! Respected Sir Mage, no matter what magic your scrolls contain, I've decided to buy them all, entirely according to your previously stated requirements.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Very well, once the white scrolls are ready, please come directly to the Orchid Fragrance Inn to find me. I'll be leaving now.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Carlo called out to Nian Bing. \"Respected Sir Mage, I have an impolite request that I hope you can grant.\"\n\nSeeing the earnest expression on Carlo's face, Nian Bing said, \"What is it? Please speak.\"\n\nCarlo sighed softly and said, \"As you know, we mercenaries have always been a low-tier profession on the continent, to put it less politely. We're essentially bodyguards or enforcers for the wealthy. Ultimately, there's only one reason: our strength isn't sufficient. High-level warriors completely look down on our profession and naturally won't join us; they simply don't believe mercenaries can amount to anything. As the Guild Master of the Ice Moon Empire's Mercenary Guild, I've assembled a mercenary group myself, with over five thousand members, composed of well-trained warriors. It's also the only Rank 1 mercenary group in our empire. If you could join our mercenary group, I believe its strength would greatly improve, and I'm willing to offer you a very high reward.\"\n\nNian Bing said somewhat humorously, \"Guild Master Carlo, you're too kind. What's so great about mages? A high-level mage would find it very difficult to defeat a Sword Master in a one-on-one situation. Even if I agreed to join your mercenary group, it wouldn't significantly benefit the group's strength. Why go to such lengths?\"\n\nCarlo shook his head and said, \"No, you don't understand. While mages don't have an advantage in direct combat with warriors, their familiarity with magic elements makes many difficult tasks impossible without their participation, especially exploratory missions. Miraculous magic can bring immense help to the entire mercenary group, something warriors simply cannot achieve. Take a simple example: if we're on a mission in a dark and damp cave, and we don't have anything to start a fire, what do we do? Fire-attribute Combat Aura cannot form a real flame.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and shook his head, saying, \"You don't need to say any more. I am already a member of the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild, so it's impossible for me to join the Mercenary Guild. I'm sorry, please forgive me.\"\n\nA look of disappointment appeared in Carlo's eyes. \"Indeed! How could mages, with their always noble status, ever look favorably upon us mercenaries?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"No, if you think that, you're mistaken. In my eyes, there has never been a distinction of high or low, noble or common. Guild Master Carlo, I still have many things of my own to do, so I cannot agree to your request. However, if you truly hope to have mages join your mercenary group, I can offer you a suggestion.\"\n\nCarlo's eyes lit up and he asked, \"What suggestion?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"How about this: when you bring the white scrolls to exchange for the magic scrolls with me, I'll give you a letter. As long as you are sincere, take this letter to the Mage Guild in Ice Snow City to see my teacher. I think he might be able to help you.\"\n\nCarlo said, confused, \"Mage Guild? I'm afraid your teacher...\"\n\nNian Bing interrupted Carlo, saying, \"Don't jump to conclusions before trying something. I've never thought of mercenaries as a disorganized mob, though of course, it'd be best if they weren't like those outside just now. Take your sincerity to Ice Snow City, and I think you'll gain something.\" After saying this, Nian Bing did not linger and left the Mercenary Guild.\n\nReturning to his room at the inn, Nian Bing lay comfortably on the bed. Everything had gone much smoother than expected. With the white scrolls, he would only need a few days to arm himself with scrolls again. He hoped he wouldn't encounter creatures like the Golden-backed Earth Dragon again; otherwise, he truly couldn't afford the losses! As soon as the scrolls were ready, he could immediately head to the Oland Empire.\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing took out a map of the continent from his Spatial Ring and carefully examined it. Although being a chef made traveling much more convenient, he was not a god after all; without any ingredients, even the most exquisite culinary skills would be useless. Based on his experience from this journey, he decided to find a suitable route to Doulundis City in the Oland Empire, ideally one where he could find appropriate lodging every day.\n\nHe slapped the map abruptly, then patted his head, muttering to himself, \"How foolish! Why didn't I ask Guild Master Carlo what famous inns or delicacies Oland City has? I was too focused on the scrolls. This city is so large, and with so many merchants coming and going, there definitely won't be a shortage of delicious food.\" The thought of food immediately lifted his spirits. On the way to Oland City, he had possessed top-tier culinary skills but lacked suitable ingredients, so he could only find whatever to fill his stomach each day. His empty stomach had long been complaining to him. Now that he had finally arrived at a big city, how could he return empty-handed?\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing put away the map and left his room. The Orchid Fragrance Inn he was staying at was just an unremarkable small inn near Ice Orchid City's north gate. He estimated there wouldn't be anything good to eat there. It was already close to evening. Nian Bing went to the inn's lobby, and just as he was about to ask the staff about any famous inns nearby, he was startled by the scene before him.",
