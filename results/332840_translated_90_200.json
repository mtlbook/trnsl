    "content": "Chapter 90: The Poster\n\nNearly a week had passed since Li Chao's disappearance. During this week, Lin Xiao had used every connection he had to search for Li Chao throughout City X, but all efforts yielded nothing.\n\nMeanwhile, Ye Bin and the others, after finding the lead of Han Xuelan, had followed her for three consecutive days, hoping to investigate whether Han Xuelan still had contact with Duan Tao. However, after three days of tracking and investigation, they had also found nothing.\n\n\"Could we have been mistaken? Has Han Xuelan really stopped contacting Duan Tao?\" After three days of hard investigation, Zhao Zhen felt that Han Xuelan was truly no longer in contact with Duan Tao.\n\n\"According to the information provided by Lin Xiao, Han Xuelan has been single since her divorce from Duan Tao. After our three days of investigation, this result should be confirmed.\" Before the three of them started following Han Xuelan, Old Xu had asked Lin Xiao to investigate Han Xuelan. Now, after three days of confirmation, Ning Hua shared the same thought as Zhao Zhen.\n\n\"Could this Han Xuelan have discovered that we are following her?\" Chen Hui frowned, feeling that things were not as simple as they seemed.\n\n\"That shouldn't be the case. We haven't gotten close to her, how could she possibly discover us?\" During Zhao Zhen and the others' investigation of Han Xuelan, all four of them relied on the surveillance cameras provided by Lin Xiao. In places without surveillance cameras, they hid in very secluded spots and used telescopes for long-range observation. Therefore, Zhao Zhen did not think Han Xuelan could have discovered their group.\n\n\"There's another possibility. Could this Han Xuelan have guessed that we would investigate her?\" Old Xu shared the same thoughts as Chen Hui. He also did not believe that this matter would be so simple. According to Old Xu's previous deductions, Han Xuelan should have been in contact with Duan Tao.\n\n\"Regardless of whether our guess is correct, it's been three days. If we keep staring at this Han Xuelan, how can we investigate the case?\" Zhao Zhen believed that they should not waste any more time on Han Xuelan at this moment.\n\nOld Xu understood Zhao Zhen's meaning. \"Old Zhao, I'll handle this Han Xuelan. You go assist Binzi and Detective Lin with investigating other leads.\"\n\n\"Uncle Xu, it's hard to avoid any oversight if it's just one person. I'll accompany you to investigate Han Xuelan.\" Chen Hui had no intention of abandoning the lead of Han Xuelan and decided to keep an eye on her with Old Xu.\n\n\"Three days is indeed a bit difficult to make a judgment. If we were to investigate, I think it would take at least a week. The other leads are with Binzi and Detective Lin. This lead was hard to come by, so let's wait a little longer. If there are still no clues after a week, it won't be too late to give up,\" Ning Hua also made his decision not to give up on the lead of Han Xuelan and continue the investigation.\n\nSeeing this, Zhao Zhen said no more and could only follow everyone to continue monitoring Han Xuelan's every move.\n\nAt the same time, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan, due to their mobility issues, were inconvenient to appear in public. They cooperated with Ye He to investigate various online forums, hoping to find some clues.\n\n\"Binzi, look at this. Do you remember it?\" Zhang Lan pointed to a post on the computer and asked Ye Bin beside him.\n\nYe Bin turned his head and looked at the post on Zhang Lan's computer screen. He nodded. \"I remember. I couldn't figure out the meaning of this post back then.\"\n\nThe post on the computer screen had only three short paragraphs. They were about \"sinners and demons.\" At the time, the group had studied it for a long time but could never understand the meaning of the post. Later, because this matter was not very related to the case, the group had temporarily set it aside. But now, while searching for clues in various forums, Zhang Lan saw this post again.\n\n\"I remember the author of this post was someone called 'Chang Sheng,' right?\" Ye Bin said, reaching out and grabbing the mouse in front of Zhang Lan's computer to scroll down. At the end of the post, there was a signature named \"Chang Sheng.\"\n\n\"Little He has also never been able to find out who this author is. Back then, I remember Little He even said that the author of this post might be a computer expert like himself.\"\n\n\"Chang Sheng.\" Ye Bin looked at the signature below the post, murmuring to himself, his mind racing. \"Brother Lan, I was wondering if the author of this post might be the same person as the author of the previous 'Taoist Story' post?\" Ye Bin's mind recalled the story of the \"fat and thin Taoists\" that Ye He had previously found, and he couldn't find the poster.\n\n\"Could it be such a coincidence?\" Zhang Lan felt that things shouldn't be so coincidental.\n\n\"I'll contact Ye He to confirm it,\" Ye Bin said as he dialed Ye He's number and then informed Ye He of his thoughts.\n\nUpon learning of Ye Bin's thoughts, Ye He immediately began comparing the two posts. Finally, after Ye He's various data comparisons and analyses, he reached a conclusion.\n\nThe author of the \"Sinners and Demons\" post and the author of the \"Fat and Thin Taoists\" story were, in all likelihood, the same person.\n\n\"Is it really such a coincidence? This is a bit too ridiculous,\" Zhang Lan said with his mouth agape, looking at Ye Bin with surprise.\n\n\"If it is indeed the same person, then we can basically confirm that this poster has a certain connection with the 'No. 18 Bus' case,\" Ye Bin said with a frown. \"This way, we have a new target. We need to find a way to find this poster.\"\n\n\"If even Little He can't find this poster, who else can?\" Zhang Lan sighed, feeling that if Ye He, with all his abilities, couldn't find the poster, then who else could?\n\n\"Ye He can't find it because there is some data that he still can't crack. With Detective Lin's help, perhaps something can be found.\" Ye Bin understood computers even better than Zhang Lan, so he knew that no matter how capable Ye He was, some things were still impossible to crack. Therefore, with Lin Xiao's help, combined with Ye He's abilities, perhaps something could be found.\n\n\"Detective Lin? How can he help?\" Zhang Lan was a little confused by Ye Bin's words because he wasn't very knowledgeable about computers; at best, he could only operate them simply.\n\n\"Brother Lan, Detective Lin is much more capable than we imagine.\" Ye Bin said, and without further explanation to Zhang Lan, he directly dialed Lin Xiao's number.\n\n\"Hello, Detective Lin, I need your help with something?\"\n\n\"The online information database?\"\n\n\"Yes, I want to find someone named 'Chang Sheng'.\"\n\n\"I'll give you access permissions to conduct a more detailed investigation. However, my permissions are also limited. Whether you can find him will depend on your luck.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\"\n\nAfter obtaining the access permissions from Lin Xiao, Ye Bin instructed Ye He to begin the investigation. However, finding a person from the vast online information database was clearly not an easy task.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 91 Coincidence",
    "content": "Chapter 91: Coincidence\n\nWith the permission to access the \"Online Information Database,\" Ye He began sifting through the vast database to find the \"poster.\" However, due to the immense volume of data, even the filtering process would take nearly a full day.\n\n\"Ye He said it will take at least a day to filter for the results.\"\n\n\"Does it need that long?\" Zhang Lan was somewhat surprised. According to his own thoughts, finding someone on a computer should be as simple as a quick search.\n\n\"The database is extremely large. To prevent any information from being missed, Ye He is not using intelligent filtering but manual selection, which naturally takes more time.\"\n\nZhang Lan just nodded at Ye Bin's explanation, though he didn't truly understand the difference between intelligent and manual filtering.\n\n\"We can only wait for Ye He. Uncle Xu should have news by now. Let's contact Uncle Xu,\" Ye Bin said, taking out his phone and calling Old Xu.\n\n\"Indeed, it's been a few days. They've been following Han Xuelan. I wonder if they've found anything.\"\n\n\"Hello, Binzi.\"\n\n\"Uncle Xu, how are things on your end? Any findings?\"\n\n\"Not yet, but I think Han Xuelan seems to have become alerted to us.\"\n\n\"Alerted? Did she detect your movements?\" Ye Bin frowned. If Han Xuelan had truly detected them and become alerted, the progress and outcome of the investigation would inevitably be affected.\n\n\"No, our actions are very discreet; she wouldn't have noticed. I suspect that after meeting Han Xuelan previously, she became alerted and has been taking precautions.\" Old Xu was confident that their movements would not be discovered by Han Xuelan.\n\nUpon hearing Old Xu's words, Ye Bin's gaze sharpened slightly, and he then said in a deep voice, \"If that's the case, it means this Han Xuelan is definitely connected to Duan Tao.\"\n\n\"That's what I'm thinking too, so I plan to extend the surveillance period.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's the only way now.\" Ye Bin agreed. Given the current situation, there were indeed no other options. \"By the way, Uncle Xu, do you remember that post we found online about 'Sinner and Demon'?\"\n\n\"I remember.\" Hearing Ye Bin's words, Old Xu immediately recalled the past events. \"What's wrong? Any findings?\" Old Xu asked, a vague guess forming in his mind.\n\n\"According to Ye He's investigation, the poster of 'Sinner and Demon' is the same person who wrote the previous 'Fat and Skinny Taoists' story.\"\n\n\"The same person? Is there such a coincidence?\" Old Xu was also surprised.\n\n\"It should be correct. With Detective Lin's help, Ye He is now looking for the poster. However, because the online information database is quite large, it will take nearly a day for manual filtering of all the data.\"\n\n\"Alright, since that's the case, we can only wait for Ye He to finish filtering. Oh, right, has Lin Xiao found any clues about Li Chao?\" Old Xu was still worried about Li Chao's safety.\n\n\"Not yet. But don't worry, Uncle Xu. Since Detective Lin is personally investigating, with his abilities, I think he'll find Li Chao soon.\" Although Ye Bin knew that Li Chao was likely in grave danger, he could only say this to Old Xu to keep him from worrying and stabilize his emotions.\n\n\"Hoo! Let's hope so!\" Old Xu sighed, a hint of melancholy in his heart. \"Alright, I need to continue monitoring Han Xuelan. If there's any news about Li Chao, remember to contact me immediately.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nAfter finishing his call with Old Xu, Ye Bin sighed and placed his phone on the table.\n\nZhang Lan, who had overheard the conversation between Old Xu and Ye Bin, gently patted Ye Bin's shoulder.\n\n\"Don't overthink it. Maybe we're just worrying too much. Perhaps Detective Lin will find Li Chao in a couple of days.\" Zhang Lan tried to comfort Ye Bin, knowing that Ye Bin was under immense pressure at the moment.\n\nYe Bin nodded. \"Yeah, maybe we are overthinking it.\" Ye Bin was unwilling to accept the possibility that Li Chao was in grave danger.\n\n\"Binzi, you mentioned seeing a girl burning joss paper earlier. What was that about?\" To change the subject and continue the investigation, Zhang Lan asked Ye Bin about the \"joss paper burning girl.\"\n\nDuring this time, although the news about the \"mysterious joss paper burner\" had fallen off the trending lists, discussions about the \"mysterious joss paper burner\" were still circulating online. What worried Ye Bin and his companions the most was that some netizens online had actually linked the \"mysterious joss paper burner\" to the previous serial murder cases. Fortunately, this was only mentioned by a few people and had not attracted widespread attention.\n\n\"I don't remember the specifics very clearly. I just had a few conversations with her at the time.\" Whenever Ye Bin thought back to the encounter with the \"joss paper burning girl,\" he felt as if he had forgotten something.\n\n\"According to the information circulating online, many people claim to have seen someone burning joss paper in the middle of the night. However, there are varying descriptions of that person's appearance. Some say the joss paper burner was an old man, some say it was a middle-aged woman, and others even say it was a middle or high school student.\" The various rumors online left Zhang Lan in a fog, and he was also full of curiosity about this \"mysterious joss paper burner.\"\n\nYe Bin frowned, trying hard to recall the scene from that night. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't accurately remember the details. \"No, the alcohol had too much of an effect, leaving my mind blank, and I can't remember anything.\" Ye Bin said, patting his head.\n\n\"If you can't remember, don't force it. Let's investigate bit by bit. Maybe someday, the true identity of this 'mysterious joss paper burner' will be revealed.\" Seeing Ye Bin clutching his head in distress, Zhang Lan quickly spoke to comfort him.\n\n\"Drinking really causes trouble.\" Ye Bin gritted his teeth, feeling a sense of guilt. If he hadn't drunk so much that day, he wouldn't be unable to recall what happened now.\n\n\"Don't blame yourself too much. There's no evidence yet to suggest that this 'mysterious joss paper burner' is related to the 'Route 18' bus case. Perhaps it's just another coincidence.\" There were too many coincidences; Zhang Lan felt that anything could be a coincidence.\n\n\"Brother Lan, I have a feeling that the 'joss paper burning girl' is closely related to the case.\" For some reason, Ye Bin always had a premonition that the \"joss paper burning girl\" he encountered that day had some connection to the \"Route 18\" bus case, as if by fate.\n\n\"Stop being so superstitious. If there really is a connection, we'll definitely discover it as long as we continue to investigate.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Hearing Old Xu's advice, Ye Bin didn't say anything further, just nodded.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 92 The abandoned game park",
    "content": "Chapter 92: The Abandoned Amusement Park\n\nIn the suburbs of X City, there was once an amusement park that captivated all children. Every weekend, it would be filled with crowds, brimming with laughter and joy.\n\nUntil one day, an accident occurred. The park's \"Pendulum\" ride, due to a faulty safety harness on a seat, caused a tourist to die on the spot. From then on, the amusement park was sealed, the former laughter disappeared, and the entire park fell into silence.\n\nLate at night, outside the abandoned amusement park in the suburbs, a black SUV was parked. About two minutes later, two couples emerged from the black SUV.\n\nOne of the couples wore matching couple outfits, each printed with two skull designs. The two skulls glowed with a faint blue light in the night, making them particularly eye-catching.\n\n\"Dongzi, is this the 'haunted' amusement park you were talking about?\" Huang Ning, the man from the skull-themed couple, had his arm around Su Lan's shoulder. He looked at the abandoned park not far away, a look of disdain on his face.\n\n\"Yeah! Ning Ge, does it feel exciting!\" The other couple's clothes weren't matching outfits, but both of them had colorful patterns painted on their clothes, giving them a very unconventional look.\n\nThe man called \"Dongzi\" was named Yuan Dongwei, and the woman beside him was Liu Na. Both had unconventional hairstyles, piercings in their ears, and wore very unconventional earrings. Coupled with their unconventional clothes, this couple exuded a strong sense of alternative \"culture.\"\n\n\"Exciting? A dilapidated amusement park, what's exciting about that!\"\n\n\"Ning Ge, you don't know, but according to the information I got, a 'child' died mysteriously in this amusement park, and the police still haven't solved the case.\" Yuan Dongwei spoke, revealing a somewhat nauseating smile.\n\n\"Really? A mysterious death? Do you think your Ning Ge is scared easily? Let's go in and take a look! I'd like to see what kind of ghosts are here!\" Ning Ge tightened his grip on Su Lan beside him, his face filled with disdain, and swaggered towards the abandoned amusement park.\n\n\"Dong Ge, is what you said true? The police couldn't solve it, so maybe there are really ghosts?\" Liu Na, beside Yuan Dongwei, felt a little scared.\n\n\"Don't worry, even if there are ghosts, your Dong Ge is here. Any messy ghosts or gods, Dong Ge can handle them in minutes.\" Yuan Dongwei patted his chest, speaking fearlessly.\n\n\"Dongzi, hurry up and catch up. If you're scared, just go back to the car and hide, haha!\" Huang Ning, walking ahead, looked back at Yuan Dongwei and teased him.\n\n\"With Ning Ge here, what am I afraid of! Haha!\" Yuan Dongwei laughed heartily, then pulled Liu Na's hand and quickened his pace, catching up to Huang Ning and Su Lan.\n\nWhen the four reached the entrance of the amusement park, they saw the locked gates. Yuan Dongwei pulled a pair of bolt cutters from his waist and directly cut open the lock.\n\n\"Whoa! Dongzi, you're really well-equipped with tools.\" Seeing Yuan Dongwei skillfully open the gates of the abandoned amusement park, Huang Ning exclaimed in surprise.\n\n\"Of course, I also brought my live-streaming equipment.\" After opening the gates, Yuan Dongwei took out a selfie stick from his waist.\n\n\"Awesome!\" Huang Ning gave Yuan Dongwei a thumbs-up.\n\nThen, with Yuan Dongwei holding the selfie stick, the group entered the abandoned amusement park.\n\n\"That's weird, what's wrong with my live stream today? Why isn't there a single person watching?\" Yuan Dongwei was a streamer who enjoyed live broadcasting. He came to this abandoned amusement park to make a video about \"haunted areas.\"\n\nNormally, Yuan Dongwei's live stream would have thousands of fans tuning in every day. As soon as he started streaming, many fans would immediately enter. But today, after he started the stream, no fans entered, which made Yuan Dongwei a little confused.\n\n\"This dump, probably has no signal.\" Huang Ning took out his phone and saw that the signal bars were full. He frowned slightly, \"Ah, that's strange, my phone has full signal! I can open web pages and stuff.\"\n\n\"Maybe my signal is down. Ning Ge, can you try starting your live stream?\" Like Yuan Dongwei, Huang Ning was also a streamer. The two of them came to the abandoned amusement park to film a program, intending to \"catch ghosts.\"\n\nHuang Ning nodded and then opened his own live stream. However, the outcome was the same as Yuan Dongwei's. The stream was empty. \"Strange, the internet should be fine! Why isn't there anyone in the live stream?\" Huang Ning had even more popularity than Yuan Dongwei. Logically, his live stream should not have zero viewers. But after checking the network, Huang Ning was surprised to find that indeed, no one had entered his live stream.\n\n\"Could it be platform maintenance?\" Yuan Dongwei speculated.\n\n\"Maintenance? They just did maintenance yesterday, so it can't be maintenance.\" Huang Ning said as he checked, confirming that other streamers' live streams had viewers, but only theirs had no one. This made Huang Ning's doubts grow. \"That's not right! Other streamers' live streams are full of people. It seems only our two live streams have no viewers.\"\n\n\"What? Could it be that our live stream was banned? Nana, check it out, what's going on?\"\n\nLiu Na heard this, took out her phone, and entered Yuan Dongwei's live stream. The next moment, a notification appeared on Yuan Dongwei's phone: Liu Na had entered the live stream.\n\n\"Holy crap, what's going on? There really is no one?\" Seeing that Liu Na had successfully entered the live stream, Yuan Dongwei's face was filled with confusion.\n\n\"Su Lan, try entering my live stream.\" Like Yuan Dongwei, Huang Ning asked his girlfriend to enter his live stream.\n\nJust like Liu Na, Su Lan also successfully entered Huang Ning's live stream. At this moment, Huang Ning's live stream also had only one person, which was Su Lan.\n\n\"Strange? Is it a bug?\"\n\n\"Other people's live streams are fine! How can only the two of us have a bug!\" Yuan Dongwei tried multiple times to enter other people's live streams and found that there were no problems with their live streams, only his and Huang Ning's had issues.\n\n\"This is strange.\" Huang Ning frowned, lost in thought. Just as everyone was confused and didn't know what was happening, the sound of a metal gate closing echoed from behind them.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nThe crisp sound of metal clashing made all four of them jump. They immediately turned around and looked at the park entrance they had just walked through.\n\nAt this moment, the park gates, which Yuan Dongwei had pried open, were tightly shut, as if no one had ever opened them.\n\n\"Ah!\" Seeing this, the timid Liu Na let out a scream. \"Ghosts!\"\n\n\"Ghosts, what ghosts! Don't howl, it's just the wind.\" Huang Ning said coldly, believing that the gate closing was just due to the wind.\n\n\"Ning Ge, there's no wind!\" Su Lan was a bit braver than Liu Na, but even so, Su Lan felt that the surroundings of the amusement park were a bit eerie. \"Could it really be ghosts?\" Su Lan stammered, her body involuntarily shivering.\n\n\"How could it be ghosts!\" A trace of a disdainful smile crossed Yuan Dongwei's face.\n\n\"Ah!\" Liu Na's scream rang out again.\n\n\"Nana, it's okay, don't be scared!\" Hearing Liu Na's scream, Yuan Dongwei quickly comforted her.\n\n\"I-I just saw a shadow dart past over there.\" Liu Na pointed towards the \"carousel\" not far to the right.\n\nHearing Liu Na's words, not only Su Lan but even the brave Huang Ning and Yuan Dongwei felt a chilling coldness.\n\n\"Where? Nana, don't scare me!\" Yuan Dongwei swallowed, followed Liu Na's pointing direction with his eyes, but saw nothing. He only saw a long-abandoned \"carousel.\"\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 93: Case Reenactment\n\nA chilling wind blew as two couples huddled together, slowly advancing through an abandoned amusement park. Fear was etched on all four of their faces.\n\n\"Did you... did you guys see that? That black shadow,\" Yuan Dongwei choked out, swallowing hard. Just moments ago, he had seen a figure dart behind the park's \"Pirate Ship.\"\n\n\"I saw it,\" Huang Ning's voice trembled. The bravery he had moments ago had completely vanished.\n\n\"Could it be wild cats or dogs or something?\" Su Lan quickly interjected, seeing her boyfriend's fear.\n\n\"Heh heh heh.\" Just as everyone's attention was focused on the \"Pirate Ship,\" a spine-chilling child's laughter echoed from behind the four of them.\n\nHearing the horrifying laughter, all four froze. Cold sweat beaded on their foreheads, but not a single one dared to turn around.\n\n\"Dongzi, take a look, what is it,\" Huang Ning said to Yuan Dongwei, his voice quivering.\n\n\"Brother Ning, you're the brave one. I'm too scared. You go see what it is,\" Yuan Dongwei replied with a wry smile. He was already petrified and had no courage to turn back.\n\n\"Lanlan, turn around and see what's there! My neck is twisted, I can't move,\" Huang Ning said, craning his neck and feigning immobility.\n\n\"I... I don't dare,\" Su Lan stammered, tears immediately welling up in her eyes from fear.\n\n\"Dongzi, have your girlfriend take a look, see what it is,\" Huang Ning shifted his attention to Liu Na.\n\nLiu Na was trembling, her arms clamped tightly around Yuan Dongwei's, her eyes shut tight as she muttered \"Amitabha.\"\n\n\"Nana, how about you take a look?\" Yuan Dongwei ventured.\n\n\"No! No! It's a ghost! It's a ghost!\" Liu Na cried out, clutching Yuan Dongwei's arm even tighter.\n\nAnd so, the four stood frozen, none daring to glance back.\n\n\"Captain Lin, this is what happened last night. Two bodies, a male and a female, were found at an amusement park on the outskirts of X City.\" Lin Xiao, who had been working tirelessly all night, barely had a moment to rest before a police officer burst into his office with a stack of documents.\n\n\"Amusement park.\" Lin Xiao took the files from the officer and began to read them carefully. Within a few pages, his expression turned grim. \"Head to the crime scene immediately.\"\n\nThe police car, driven by the officer, sped Lin Xiao to the suburban amusement park. Upon his arrival, Lin Xiao found the area outside the park's perimeter secured by police tape already swarming with media.\n\n\"What's going on? Who notified the media?\" Lin Xiao questioned the driver as he saw the crowd.\n\nThe officer shrugged and replied innocently, \"Captain Lin, I'm not sure.\"\n\n\"Who is the investigation team leader at the crime scene now?\"\n\n\"Team Leader Yan.\"\n\n\"Yan Zhenjiang,\" Lin Xiao murmured. Without further inquiry, he got out of the car, passed through the police tape, and entered the crime scene secured by the police.\n\nUpon seeing Lin Xiao, all the police investigation team members at the scene, except for one, greeted him with smiles. \"Captain Lin.\"\n\nLin Xiao nodded in response and then walked towards the only officer who hadn't greeted him. This was the investigation team leader, Yan Zhenjiang.\n\n\"Team Leader Yan, where are the bodies?\" Lin Xiao looked around the crime scene, unable to locate the two bodies mentioned in the report.\n\nYan Zhenjiang pointed upwards with his finger.\n\nFollowing Yan Zhenjiang's direction, Lin Xiao immediately noticed two bodies hanging beneath the cabin of the giant Ferris wheel.\n\nThe moment he saw the male and female bodies suspended under the Ferris wheel cabin, Lin Xiao's expression turned stern. \"Case reenactment.\"\n\nPreviously, in the \"Bus Route 18\" case, a boy had been found hanged beneath the cabin of a Ferris wheel in an amusement park. The Ferris wheel in front of him was the very same one. This familiar scene repeating itself left Lin Xiao feeling rather surprised.\n\n\"Hasn't the rescue team arrived yet?\"\n\n\"They should be here soon,\" Yan Zhenjiang replied coldly, his gaze fixed on the two bodies beneath the Ferris wheel cabin.\n\n\"Any findings?\"\n\n\"An SUV is parked in front of the park's main entrance. After investigating the dashcam footage from the SUV, it was confirmed that there were likely two men and two women in the vehicle – two couples. They were all streamers, and they came to the amusement park seeking thrills.\" Before Lin Xiao's arrival, Yan Zhenjiang had already conducted a detailed investigation of the surrounding area.\n\n\"Haven't the other two been found?\"\n\n\"No.\" Yan Zhenjiang nodded and handed a document bag to Lin Xiao. \"This is a mobile phone left at the crime scene. There is a voice recording on it. The recording captures their conversation after entering the amusement park. Towards the end of the recording, based on their discussion, it seems they saw something. After that, the recording cuts off.\"\n\nLin Xiao took the document bag, operated the phone through the bag, and opened the audio file. A recording of about ten minutes then played. The first half consisted of the four people's conversation. In the latter half, it could be heard that the four seemed to have seen something in the amusement park, followed by a scream, and then the recording ended.\n\nAfter listening to the recording, Lin Xiao looked at the two bodies hanging beneath the Ferris wheel cabin. \"Anything else found besides this?\"\n\n\"If I'm not mistaken, the woman seems to be clutching something in her hand. However, we'll need to wait for the rescue team to arrive and bring the bodies down before we can confirm.\"\n\nFollowing Yan Zhenjiang's reminder, Lin Xiao also noticed that the female victim hanging from the Ferris wheel cabin seemed to be grasping something.\n\nAs no other clues were found at the scene, Lin Xiao and the others could only wait for the rescue team. About fifteen minutes later, the rescue team arrived and finally managed to bring down the two bodies suspended beneath the Ferris wheel.\n\nAfter lowering the bodies, Lin Xiao and Yan Zhenjiang began to examine them. They discovered ligature marks on the necks of both victims but no other injuries.\n\n\"No injuries on their bodies. It can be preliminarily determined that the cause of death was suffocation due to strangulation around the neck,\" Yan Zhenjiang concluded after a thorough examination.\n\nLin Xiao nodded slightly, in complete agreement with Yan Zhenjiang's assessment. \"What she was holding in her hand is a half-burned paper money.\" Prying open the female victim's hand, Lin Xiao found a piece of paper money that was only half-burned.\n\n\"No paper money was found in the victims' car, nor are there any signs of paper money being burned nearby.\" Yan Zhenjiang was puzzled. Where did this half-burned paper money come from?\n\nLooking at the half-burned paper money in the file bag, Lin Xiao realized that this case was definitely connected to \"Bus Route 18.\" After all, not only was there half-burned paper money in the female victim's hand, but the crime scene was also the starting point of \"Bus Route 18.\"\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 94 Question",
    "content": "Chapter 94: The Problem\n\n\"Hey, brother, I've found the name of the person who posted.\" After nearly a day of manual sifting, Ye He finally found the poster's name in the \"Online Information Database.\" As soon as he found the name, Ye He immediately called Ye Bin.\n\n\"Really! What's the poster's name?\" Hearing that Ye He had found the poster's name, Ye Bin was a little excited and quickly asked.\n\n\"Zhou Yapeng.\" When the name of the poster was spoken on the other end of the phone, Ye Bin froze for a moment. After a long while, he came back to his senses.\n\n\"You, you said the poster's name was who?\" Ye Bin thought he had misheard and asked Ye He again.\n\n\"Zhou Ya. Peng.\" Ye He spoke slowly, pronouncing the poster's name one character at a time.\n\nWhen he confirmed that Ye He had said \"Zhou Yapeng,\" Ye Bin's expression instantly turned extremely grim. \"Xiao He, are you sure you didn't make a mistake?\" Ye Bin asked Ye He in a deep voice.\n\n\"No.\" Ye He's words were very firm, and he was very confident in the information he had found.\n\n\"Okay, I know. You carry on, and I'll contact you again if there's anything,\" Ye Bin said, and then hung up the phone.\n\n\"Binzi, what's wrong?\" Zhang Lan, who was standing beside him, saw Ye Bin with a grim expression and immediately realized that something must have happened.\n\n\"The poster's information has been found.\" Ye Bin said coldly, his face still grim.\n\n\"Found it?\" Hearing that the poster's information had been found, a flicker of excitement crossed Zhang Lan's face. \"How is it? Who is this person?\"\n\n\"Zhou Ya. Peng.\"\n\n\"Zhou...\" Just like Ye Bin, Zhang Lan's expression instantly turned extremely grim. \"How is that possible! Could it be? Is this another coincidence!\" Although he said this, Zhang Lan knew in his heart that this incident was definitely not a coincidence.\n\nYe Bin frowned, shaking his head slightly. \"I don't know either...\"\n\n\"Binzi, I remember that the post 'Sinner and Demon' was published five years ago.\" Zhang Lan first tried to calm himself down, then began to recall things about the post, trying to find some connection with \"Zhou Yapeng.\"\n\n\"Yes, Zhou Yapeng also disappeared five years ago. I just don't know if this Zhou Yapeng is the driver of the 'No. 18' bus or the village chief of Blackwater Village.\" With Zhang Lan's reminder, Ye Bin also gradually calmed down and began to think about \"Zhou Yapeng.\"\n\n\"Or perhaps, these two Zhou Yapengs are the same person.\" Although there was no evidence to prove that the bus driver Zhou Yapeng and the village chief Zhou Yapeng were the same person, judging by the time of their disappearance, it was indeed possible that they were the same person.\n\n\"Who exactly is this Zhou Yapeng?\" Ye Bin frowned tightly, supporting his forehead with one hand, feeling the fog in his heart growing thicker and thicker.\n\nAt the same time, in the abandoned amusement park, Lin Xiao, Yan Zhenjiang, and some police officers on the scene were repeatedly investigating the surroundings of the amusement park, but they could not find any clues related to the case.\n\n\"Team Lin, Team Yan, we've practically turned this amusement park upside down, but we still haven't found any clues.\" A young police officer said to Lin Xiao and Yan Zhenjiang with some helplessness.\n\nLin Xiao and Yan Zhenjiang did not answer the young police officer. They both had grim expressions, seemingly contemplating something.\n\n\"Team Lin? Team Yan?\" Seeing that they were not paying attention to him, the young police officer gave an awkward smile and then spoke softly.\n\n\"Kid, don't disturb them. They are thinking.\" Just as the young police officer was about to speak again, an older police officer gently patted his shoulder to remind him.\n\n\"Oh!\" The young police officer immediately closed his mouth and stood quietly on the side, waiting.\n\nAfter a long period of time, Lin Xiao finally emerged from his thoughts. Then, Lin Xiao turned and walked towards the exit of the amusement park.\n\n\"What's wrong with Team Lin? Are we leaving?\" Seeing Lin Xiao suddenly turn and leave, all the police officers looked confused. However, even with their doubts, under the obstruction of the older police officer, all the police officers just stood in place and did not move.\n\nWhen he reached the entrance of the amusement park, Lin Xiao did not leave. Instead, he walked around the entrance of the amusement park and then returned to the crime scene.\n\n\"Did you find anything?\" After Lin Xiao returned from his circuit, Yan Zhenjiang suddenly looked at Lin Xiao and asked coldly.\n\nLin Xiao nodded slightly upon hearing this. \"There are traces of climbing on the main gate of the amusement park. Judging by the size of the footprints on the gate, it might be a child.\"\n\nUpon hearing Lin Xiao's words, Yan Zhenjiang's expression did not change at all, but the other police officers exchanged wide-eyed glances, looking bewildered.\n\n\"A child's footprints?\"\n\n\"In this desolate area, how could there be a child's footprints? Could it be that there wasn't just four people in the car, but also a child?\" The police officers were completely confused and had no idea what was going on.\n\n\"Are they footprints that were left not long ago?\"\n\n\"No more than a day old.\" Lin Xiao answered Yan Zhenjiang's question. After answering, Lin Xiao dispatched two police officers to collect evidence, wanting to investigate who left the footprints.\n\n\"The clues have been mostly investigated. Let's go deal with the media. I'm going back.\" Yan Zhenjiang said coldly, then turned and left the amusement park.\n\n\"Team Lin, the media is indeed a troublesome issue. If it's not dealt with promptly, public opinion might run wild again.\" A police officer, having deeply experienced the \"terrible\" nature of the media, urgently reminded Lin Xiao.\n\n\"We haven't found any useful clues yet, so it's not easy to deal with those media outlets.\" The older police officer sighed. Having been a police officer for over thirty years, no one knew the \"terrible\" nature of media public opinion better than he did.\n\n\"Seal off the crime scene, leave a few people to guard it in shifts. I'll handle the media.\" Lin Xiao said calmly, then turned and left the amusement park.\n\nLin Xiao walked out of the amusement park, followed the cordon, and walked towards the dense crowd of media and reporters.\n\n\"Team Lin, it is said that this case is closely related to the previous murder case of the 'little boy.' What is your view on this case?\"\n\n\"Team Lin, before you came to X City, people called you the modern-day 'Di Renjie.' However, since arriving in X City, you haven't solved a single case. May I ask why?\"\n\n\"Some people say that the title of modern-day 'Di Renjie' is only in name and not in reality. How do you view this issue?\"\n\nThe questions from the various media reporters to Lin Xiao were all similar. Some focused on the \"amusement park\" case, while others were concerned about Lin Xiao's failure to solve any cases since his arrival in X City. Finally, some were interested in Lin Xiao's views on the public's doubts.\n\nUnder the \"siege\" of the media reporters, Lin Xiao did not choose to evade. Instead, he crossed the cordon and walked into the center of the media reporters.\n\n\"Give me some time, and I will find the killer.\" Lin Xiao only said one sentence, then bowed deeply to all the media reporters. Afterward, under the cover of the police officers, Lin Xiao finally broke free from the media reporters' encirclement.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 95: \"The Truth\"\n\n\"Give me some time, and I will find the killer,\" Lin Xiao's statement to the media caused a huge stir in X City.\n\n\"This Lin Xiao has been in X City for some time, and from beginning to end, no clues have been found. I feel like this person is all name and no substance, there's no need to believe him anymore.\"\n\n\"You can't say that. Solving cases isn't a matter of a day or two. The X City police didn't find any clues before, which means this case is particularly tricky.\"\n\n\"So what if it's tricky? With today's advanced technology, is 'tricky' just an excuse for them not to find any clues? I think this Lin Xiao's reputation was just hyped up by people.\"\n\n\"The death rate in X City is soaring. If this continues, X City might become uninhabitable.\" Due to the frequent homicides in X City recently, some citizens have started considering moving.\n\n\"Why should we move? If something happens, the public has to be responsible? What's the government for then? What are the police for?\" Most citizens have no intention of moving. These people attribute everything happening in X City to the police.\n\n\"Is the modern-day 'Di Renjie,' Lin Xiao, all name and no substance?\" Major headlines in X City newspapers were all occupied by Lin Xiao. At this moment, under the media's public opinion, Lin Xiao became the focal point, and all the citizens began to question whether Lin Xiao truly deserved the title of the modern-day 'Di Renjie.'\n\nWith the media's widespread public opinion, the public's doubts grew stronger. Consequently, the police department's higher-ups also paid attention, and Police Chief Hao Zhengjun personally met with Lin Xiao.\n\n\"Detective Lin, it's been almost two months since you came to X City. You should be aware of the recent events outside. I'd like to ask if Detective Lin has found any clues regarding the multiple homicides in X City. What have you discovered about the 'killers,' Ye Bin and Zhang Lan?\" Although Hao Zhengjun was the X City Chief, he showed a certain degree of respect when facing Lin Xiao.\n\n\"Chief Hao, I will investigate the case thoroughly, and I will definitely bring the 'killer' to justice. However, I hope the Chief can give me more time,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, his expression very serene when asked by Hao Zhengjun.\n\n\"Detective Lin, I understand that this case is tricky. However, I just want to know if there has been any progress in the case. If there's no progress at all, then with the media's public opinion and the public's doubts, this...\" In reality, Hao Zhengjun understood the complexity of the case, but due to social pressure, he had no choice but to approach Lin Xiao to inquire about the case's progress.\n\n\"Chief Hao, I know you're in a difficult position, but this case is not that simple. I can only assure you that I will thoroughly investigate the case and bring the 'killer' to justice, but I need time.\" Lin Xiao could empathize with Hao Zhengjun's predicament. \"If the social pressure is too great, Chief Hao can push all the blame onto me.\" After speaking, Lin Xiao got up and prepared to leave Hao Zhengjun's office.\n\nJust as Lin Xiao reached the doorway of Hao Zhengjun's office, Hao Zhengjun suddenly spoke, calling him back.\n\n\"Detective Lin, I'm truly sorry. Sometimes, we have no choice.\" Hao Zhengjun sighed deeply, shook his head, and spoke with full of apology.\n\nLin Xiao did not respond to Hao Zhengjun's apology. Instead, he continued walking, leaving Hao Zhengjun's office directly. Not long after Lin Xiao left, Ye Bin's superior, Liao Muyang, arrived at Hao Zhengjun's office.\n\n\"Chief, you sent for me?\"\n\n\"Muyang, the events in X City have been widely reported online, and it's heard everywhere across the country. If this continues, it will eventually affect social stability. Therefore, the higher-ups have issued a strict order for us to solve the case quickly,\" Hao Zhengjun said with some helplessness.\n\n\"Chief, I'm already aware of this matter. However, the recent cases are indeed tricky, and it's not Detective Lin's fault.\"\n\n\"Muyang, you mentioned last time that this case is related to the supernatural. Is that true?\" Liao Muyang had previously told Hao Zhengjun that the X City case was related to the supernatural. However, as the police chief, Hao Zhengjun could not agree with this matter. But with no progress in the case and coupled with some rumors online, especially the video of the \"mysterious person burning joss paper\" that was exposed online, Hao Zhengjun was now somewhat forced to believe that this case was related to the supernatural.\n\n\"Chief, do you believe that Ye Bin and Zhang Lan are the 'killers' in these cases?\" Liao Muyang did not answer Hao Zhengjun's question but asked back instead.\n\nHearing Liao Muyang's words, Hao Zhengjun sighed deeply and then slowly said, \"I don't know that Zhang Lan very well, but that boy Ye Bin, I've met him. He has put too much effort into solving cases over the years; he's a good kid, so I don't think he's the 'killer.' However...\" At this point, Hao Zhengjun frowned slightly. \"Muyang, you've been in the police force for over ten years. You should know that what the public needs is the truth.\"\n\n\"What if this truth doesn't exist? Or, what if this truth is completely different from what we imagine?\"\n\n\"Muyang, I know what you're thinking, but society is like this now. Even if this 'truth' is vastly different from the truth we perceive, society still needs a 'truth.' That boy Ye Bin understands this principle, so he became the 'truth' in people's minds.\" Hao Zhengjun finished speaking, shook his head, and sighed. \"When people pursue the truth excessively, they are often farthest from it.\"\n\n\"Binzi, do you think we can really solve the case? Why do I have a feeling that we are getting farther and farther away from the truth?\" Zhang Lan and Ye Bin stood by the window, looking out at the endless darkness outside, murmuring.\n\nHearing Zhang Lan's words, Ye Bin just shook his head, \"I don't know either...\" Up to this point, although their group had found many clues, from beginning to end, there were no clues that could bring them closer to the \"truth.\" It seemed that there was always a layer of fog separating the truth from their group.\n\nWhile Ye Bin, Lin Xiao, and others were investigating the case, Old Xu's team was constantly monitoring Han Xuelan. However, Han Xuelan's movements were very regular, and no flaws could be found.\n\n\"Her life is a two-point, one-line routine; no flaws can be found on this Han Xuelan.\" Ning Hua was responsible for monitoring Han Xuelan's route from home to work, but during this period of surveillance, Ning Hua found no issues.\n\n\"She gets up around 6:30 AM every morning, leaves at 7:30 AM, arrives home around 7:10 PM, and goes to sleep around 10 PM. Her daily routine is very regular.\" Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing were responsible for monitoring Han Xuelan's departure and arrival times and also found no problems.\n\n\"At work, she is always in a working state, only occasionally chatting with colleagues. Currently, there have been no findings.\" Old Xu and Zhao Zhen were responsible for monitoring Han Xuelan's situation at work.\n\nEvery day, the five of them would compile their surveillance reports on Han Xuelan. However, combining the surveillance information from the five, after nearly five consecutive days, everyone still found no issues.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 96: Clues\n\nNearly two days had passed since the amusement park case occurred again. In those two days, Lin Xiao had investigated day and night but found no new clues.\n\n\"Captain Lin, it's been two full days since the case happened, and you haven't slept. If you continue like this, I'm afraid you won't be able to handle it,\" a young police officer said, bringing Lin Xiao a cup of coffee. Seeing the deep dark circles under Lin Xiao's eyes, the young officer expressed his concern and tried to persuade him.\n\n\"I'm fine, you go ahead and get busy,\" Lin Xiao dismissed the young officer's persuasion.\n\n\"Captain Lin, there was an old police officer in the station who worked for almost seven consecutive days to investigate a drug case. Although the case was solved, that old officer...\" the young officer wanted to use an example to persuade Lin Xiao.\n\n\"Thank you for your kindness. I know. If I really can't handle it, I'll take care of myself. Don't worry,\" Lin Xiao said, giving the young officer a smile.\n\nSeeing the smile on Lin Xiao's face, the young officer didn't say anything more. He nodded and turned to leave.\n\nAfter the young officer left, Lin Xiao picked up the coffee cup on the table and was about to take a sip when he was suddenly interrupted by a surveillance video on the computer.\n\nLin Xiao stared intently at the computer screen, put down the coffee cup in his hand, and then started typing on the keyboard, replaying the surveillance video on the computer.\n\nIn the surveillance video, a mysterious person carrying an iron bucket appeared. Although the person's face was not visible, Lin Xiao could tell from the body features that it was a young woman.\n\n\"The mysterious person burning ghost money?\" Looking at the woman in the surveillance video, Lin Xiao frowned slightly. He recalled a video that had been circulating online during this time. Although that video was not as clear as the surveillance video, Lin Xiao could roughly compare the two videos and concluded that the people in both videos were likely the same.\n\nAfter making his judgment, Lin Xiao quickly typed on the keyboard, searching for clues about the \"mysterious person burning ghost money\" online.\n\nAfter searching for some time, Lin Xiao found some clues about the \"mysterious person burning ghost money.\" According to netizens' descriptions, the \"mysterious person burning ghost money\" usually appeared late at night, and there was video evidence that the mysterious person's characteristics were: female, with disheveled hair, wearing a white dress, and carrying an iron bucket.\n\nLin Xiao stared at the two videos on the computer screen showing the \"mysterious woman burning ghost money\" and fell into thought. After about five minutes, he took out his phone, opened the map on his phone screen, and started searching. As a result, he found two common points at the scenes where the \"mysterious woman burning ghost money\" was captured in videos: both video scenes had previously experienced homicides, and not far from the video scenes, there was also a bus stop sign for \"Route 18.\"\n\n\"It's as I suspected,\" Lin Xiao murmured softly after discovering these two common points, confirming his conjecture.\n\n\"Hello, Fang Chen, how's it going over there?\"\n\n\"Brother Lin, I haven't found Li Chao yet, but I've found Li Chao's family.\"\n\n\"What did his family say?\"\n\n\"Captain Lin, according to Li Chao's family, Li Chao and his father died in an accident five years ago. After that, I specifically investigated Li Chao and his father's files and finally found that their files seemed to have been tampered with. Their files did not have a record of accidental death, but I found a newspaper from five years ago, and that newspaper did indeed report the accidental deaths of Li Chao and his son.\"\n\nAfter listening to Fang Chen's account, Lin Xiao frowned. \"Fang Chen, go and investigate the detailed information of all the deceased victims in City X now.\"\n\n\"Understood. By the way, Brother Lin, have you found anything on your end?\"\n\n\"I've found some clues about the 'mysterious woman burning ghost money' online, but I haven't figured it out completely yet. If you find anything, report it to me immediately.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nAfter hanging up Fang Chen's call, Lin Xiao dialed Ye Bin's number.\n\nAt this moment, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan were troubled by the lack of any clues. Seeing Lin Xiao's call, they immediately felt a glimmer of hope.\n\n\"Hello? Detective Lin? What's wrong?\" Ye Bin asked urgently after answering the phone.\n\n\"Have you found anything on your end?\" Lin Xiao asked Ye Bin instead of answering his question.\n\n\"Yes, we found some clues, but there's been no progress,\" Ye Bin said helplessly.\n\n\"What clues?\"\n\n\"It's about the previous 'Taoist Story' post. We found that the poster of the 'Taoist Story' post and the poster of a previous post about 'Route 18' bus are the same person. Moreover, after verification, we also found that this person is 'Zhou Yapeng,' and this Zhou Yapeng, among the clues we found, is the village chief of 'Heishui Village' and a former driver of the 'Route 18' bus.\" Ye Bin briefly narrated his findings to Lin Xiao.\n\n\"Zhou Yapeng,\" Lin Xiao murmured. He had also investigated this name before, but it was basically the same as the investigations by Ye Bin and others; no information or clues about \"Zhou Yapeng\" were found.\n\n\"Detective Lin, what about you? Have you found anything?\"\n\n\"Yes. First, about my investigation, I found that the scenes where the 'mysterious woman burning ghost money' appeared had all experienced homicides, and these homicides were not far from the 'Route 18' bus stop.\"\n\n\"In that case, this 'mysterious woman burning ghost money' has some connection with the 'Route 18' bus,\" Zhang Lan directly made a judgment based on Lin Xiao's findings.\n\nYe Bin frowned slightly at this judgment. At this moment, a person appeared in his mind.\n\n\"Detective Lin, have you found this mysterious woman?\" Ye Bin asked softly.\n\n\"Not yet, but besides this, Fang Chen has been looking for Li Chao. Just now, Fang Chen found something about Li Chao.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Hearing about Li Chao, Ye Bin was also very concerned. After all, during this period, Old Xu had been very worried about Li Chao, mentioning him every day.\n\n\"Li Chao and his father died five years ago.\"\n\n\"...\" Hearing Lin Xiao's words, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan were instantly stunned. They looked at each other in surprise, speechless for a moment.\n\nAfter a long while, Ye Bin calmed down and then slowly said, \"Detective Lin, Li Chao and his father died five years ago. What does that mean?\" At this moment, Ye Bin was filled with confusion, unable to imagine what had happened.\n\nLin Xiao recounted Fang Chen's words to Ye Bin verbatim.\n\n\"If this is true, then could the previous victims be the same as Li Chao and his son?\" Zhang Lan said after listening to Lin Xiao's account, voicing her thoughts.\n\n\"If that's the case, it doesn't quite make sense. The boy who went missing at the beginning, and the boy who died in the amusement park, their families all knew about them, so they couldn't be the same as Li Chao and his son,\" Ye Bin directly rejected Zhang Lan's idea.\n\n\"I have already asked Fang Chen to investigate the detailed information of all the victims. Once the investigation results come out, we can make a judgment.\" Lin Xiao had the same idea as Zhang Lan, but he also knew that if he followed this line of thought, it wouldn't theoretically make sense. According to Li Chao and his father's family, they had died five years ago, but the families of the victims in other cases had never said that they had died long ago.\n\n\"What if, even the victims' families don't know they are already dead?\" Ye Bin's next sentence made Zhang Lan stunned, and Lin Xiao's gaze instantly sharpened.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

I've made up my mind, I'm quitting next week. Really!\"\n\n\"Oh, come on. You said the same thing last month when we were working overtime. I haven't seen you quit yet.\"\n\n\"Last time, the boss himself came to smooth things over with me. If he hadn't, I would have quit ages ago.\"\n\n\"The boss smoothed things over with you? Did I hear that right? Don't make me laugh.\"\n\n\"Who's lying to you! The boss spoke to me personally, told me to work harder, and then gave me a promotion and a raise.\"\n\n\"Heh, then you just wait! I feel like in another thousand or eight hundred years, it might actually happen.\"\n\nInside a company, two employees were talking during overtime. One employee, dissatisfied with the boss's demand for unpaid overtime, made a threat to quit the following week, but the other employee thought he was just boasting, as he had said the same thing more than once.\n\nThe company's employees were working late. Around eleven o'clock at night, the company was almost empty, with only a few employees who hadn't finished their work, continuing their tasks amidst complaints.\n\n\"Oh, I can't take it anymore. If this keeps up, I'll go crazy. I'm going home. I'll do it tomorrow.\" The employee who was previously thought to be boasting suddenly stood up from his office chair. He then haphazardly piled the messy files on his desk into a heap, stuffed them all into his briefcase, put on his coat, and left the company, briefcase in hand.\n\n\"Wait for me! I'm leaving too!\" Seeing this, the other employee hurriedly tidied up the files on his desk and left with the boasting employee.\n\n\"The boss is truly a vampire. Working so hard overtime, not only not giving me overtime pay, but also being so stingy on a daily basis. This morning, I was less than a minute late, and he wants to deduct my full attendance for the month. Not a shred of humanity.\" Walking home, the boasting employee complained about the boss's various faults as he walked.\n\n\"You're living under someone else's roof; there's nothing you can do about it,\" the other employee sighed. Compared to the boasting employee, the other one was relatively calm.\n\n\"Hey, are you interested in quitting together next week? Just to make the boss look foolish? Then the two of us can go into business together, and maybe one day, we'll be his boss!\" The boasting employee excitedly patted the other employee's shoulder.\n\nHearing this, the other employee shook his head directly. \"Just forget it. If I work with you, we'll end up in trouble sooner or later.\"\n\n\"What kind of talk is that? What do you mean, 'end up in trouble sooner or later if you work with me'? Let me tell you, working with me has boundless prospects!\" The boasting employee said, a victorious smile appearing on his face.\n\n\"Sigh...\" Seeing this, the other employee shook his head and sighed, no longer paying attention to the boasting employee.\n\nSince there were no buses, the two employees had to walk back to their apartments. Although their apartments were not far from the company, it still took nearly forty minutes to walk.\n\nOn the way, the two initially chatted as they walked. But as the weather grew colder, they both hugged their arms tightly to their chests, walking quickly and shivering, with no mood to continue chatting.\n\n\"This weather, how can it change so fast! I'm freezing!\" The boasting employee finally couldn't help but complain about the cold weather.\n\n\"Talk less and hurry up. It's not safe outside lately. Let's go back and rest early,\" the other employee urged the boasting employee to speed up.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't realize you believed in this stuff?\" The boasting employee smiled curiously.\n\nHearing this, the other employee rolled his eyes at the boasting employee. \"Haven't you heard the saying, 'It's better to believe it's there than not believe it's there'?\"\n\n\"Let me tell you, you've seen too much fake news online, and you've become superstitious. What about 'the girl burning joss paper'? I just want to laugh when I hear it. Who would be out burning joss paper in the middle of the night unless they were mentally unstable? Even if they were, they'd be pretending just to get attention.\" The boasting employee had always believed that the online news about \"the girl burning joss paper\" was just people pretending to get attention.\n\nSeeing the boasting employee speak with such conviction, the other employee could only shake his head helplessly and say nothing more.\n\nThus, the two walked all the way. Just as they were about to reach their apartment building, they saw a bus that had just passed by at the street corner.\n\n\"That's strange, at this hour? How can there still be a bus?\" The other employee took out his phone and checked the time. It was already past midnight. According to reason, there shouldn't have been any buses at this hour.\n\n\"A bus?! Where? You must be seeing things.\" Hearing this, the boasting employee followed the direction of the other employee's gaze but only saw a dim streetlamp, not the supposed bus.\n\n\"I really think a bus just drove past. I even saw the words 'Route 18' on the taillights,\" the other employee said, then shivered. He thought of the \"paranormal\" news he had seen online in recent days, many of which mentioned a \"Route 18\" bus traveling at midnight.\n\n\"'Route 18'?\" Hearing the other employee's words, the boasting employee also felt a chill crawl up his spine. He knew about the \"paranormal\" news concerning \"Route 18\" because there were many rumors online. \"Hey, you're really superstitious. I think you've just seen too much fake news online and your eyes are playing tricks on you. Let's go home quickly.\" The boasting employee spoke with a slightly trembling voice, all the while tugging at the other employee beside him, heading towards the apartment building.\n\n\"I really saw it! The back of that bus did have 'Route 18' written on it.\" Suddenly, the other employee became agitated, broke free from the boasting employee's hand, and ran towards the street corner.\n\n\"Hey!\" The boasting employee was stunned by this, but by instinct, he quickly followed, wanting to catch the other employee.\n\nFor some reason, the other employee's running speed was incredibly fast, and the boasting employee couldn't keep up. When he saw the other employee disappear around the street corner, the boasting employee stopped, not daring to follow further. At this moment, for some unknown reason, the boasting employee felt a strong sense of dread.\n\n\"Xiao Zhao! Xiao Zhao!\" Standing in place, the boasting employee called out the other employee's name, but there was no response.\n\n\"Phew! Amitabha, God bless!\" The boasting employee clasped his hands fearfully, muttering to himself. Finally, he mustered up his courage and slowly took hesitant steps towards the street corner.\n\nAs he approached the street corner, the boasting employee fearfully glanced down the road around the bend.\n\nOn the other side of the corner, there was a dim streetlamp, and under it, a seemingly abandoned bus stop. In front of the bus stop, the boasting employee saw an iron barrel, from which flames seemed to be rising.\n\nSeeing this, the boasting employee's mind raced with rumors from \"paranormal\" news.\n\n\"Xiao Zhao! Where are you? Don't scare me!\" The boasting employee trembled, sweat soaking his entire body.\n\n\"Hehehe, big brother, hello.\" A chilling laughter echoed from behind the boasting employee.\n\n\"Help! Help me!\" With a desperate roar, an autumn wind swept through, and the night returned to silence.\n\n(End of chapter)",

Not long after Lin Xiao started his investigation, a police officer rushed into his office in a panic.\n\n\"Captain Lin! It's bad! Something's happened! Something's happened!\" The officer panted, rushing into Lin Xiao's office and quickly handing him a mobile phone.\n\n\"What is it? Why are you so flustered?\" Lin Xiao took the phone from the officer with a puzzled expression. After a brief glance at the screen, Lin Xiao's face immediately sank. \"Where was this filmed?\"\n\nThe phone screen showed a video of a man holding a small knife and slitting his wrists.\n\nBlood spilled everywhere. With a chilling laugh, the man in the video leaned back and fell into a pool of blood.\n\n\"South Ring West Road.\"\n\n\"Has the media caught wind of this?\" Lin Xiao frowned, looking at the video on the phone screen, and asked in a deep voice.\n\n\"This video has been leaked and is dominating the homepages of all news outlets.\"\n\nHearing the officer's words, Lin Xiao's expression grew even more grim, realizing that the trouble was escalating.\n\nDue to the rapid spread of online news, the video had been posted for less than half an hour, and the news of \"Man Slits Wrists and Commits Suicide\" had already surpassed ten million clicks. If not for Lin Xiao's assistance from the cyber police to delete the videos posted by various news outlets, the impact of the situation would have continued to expand.\n\n\"Did you hear? Last night, on South Ring West Road, a man slit his wrists and committed suicide. I saw the video. Although a part was edited out, I heard the man's laugh at the end. It was so creepy.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I saw that video too. I watched the uncut version. The man was laughing the entire time he was slitting his wrists, and he only stopped laughing after he fell to the ground.\"\n\n\"My God, that's too scary. I heard that person was possessed by evil spirits.\"\n\n\"Possessed by evil spirits?\"\n\n\"Like a ghost! Don't you remember, X City was haunted a while back? But the police said it was caused by a police officer's murder in the precinct. Now that I think about it, could that police officer be a ghost!\"\n\n\"What! This is getting out of hand, ghosts in the police station! It's scary just thinking about it!\"\n\nIn less than half a day, X City was in a state of panic. News about the police station being \"haunted\" became a hot topic among netizens. Some residents of X City even went directly to the police station to demand an explanation.\n\n\"Hey! Come out and explain! X City is in chaos, and everyone is afraid to go out. Police, are you even managing things?\"\n\n\"That's right! A while back, there was a murder case at the amusement park. Two consecutive cases, could it be the same person? It's been so long, and the killer hasn't been caught, yet the cases keep happening. What are you police officers doing?\"\n\n\"We want a reasonable explanation!\"\n\n\"Yes! Give us an explanation.\"\n\n\"Hand over the killer! Hand over the killer! Hand over the killer!\"\n\nIn front of the police station, all the officers remained inside. Faced with public questioning and the media's incitement, the X City Police Department had completely lost the trust of the public.\n\nYe Bin and Zhang Lan stood in front of the television, watching the news report. Seeing the crowd gathered at the police station entrance, both of them felt a pang of unease.\n\n\"What we feared most has happened,\" Zhang Lan shook her head and sighed deeply.\n\nYe Bin did not speak, his gaze fixed on the news on the television, lost in thought.\n\nMeanwhile, Old Xu and his team, who were monitoring Han Xuelan, also saw the news. The moment they saw it, everyone's faces fell. However, not a single person spoke. The current situation was very similar to the past. The only difference was that the heroes of yesterday had become \"killers\" today, and there would be no second hero to step forward and become the \"killer\" again.\n\n\"Is this reality? Heh, how ridiculous.\" Looking at the public opinion and abuse online, Chen Hui finally couldn't help but speak, gritting his teeth and sneering. \"We are risking our lives investigating here, and them! They are all hiding behind their screens, discussing this and that! Why!\" Chen Hui clenched his fists tightly and slammed them against a nearby wall. The next moment, blood seeped out, staining the wall red.\n\nNo one spoke in response to Chen Hui's words, because, at that moment, everyone shared the same thought, \"We are clearly working our hardest, yet no one acknowledges it. Instead, there are people who will gossip, mock, and even curse behind our backs.\"\n\n\"I'm done! Why should I risk my life to save such a world! Why!\" Chen Hui, unable to suppress his anger, gritted his teeth and turned to leave.\n\n\"Chen Hui!\" Just as Chen Hui took his first step, Old Xu spoke sternly, calling back the departing Chen Hui.\n\nChen Hui gritted his teeth, turned around, and glared at Old Xu. \"For those people! Binzi and the others can only hide now. What more do you want? For one of us to go out and be the 'killer' again?\" Chen Hui questioned.\n\n\"Chen Hui, calm down first,\" Zhao Zhen also chimed in to persuade him.\n\n\"Calm down! How can you ask me to calm down? They've already harmed Binzi! And it's not over. If this continues, we will also become like Binzi. We'll try our hardest, only to be called 'incompetent, useless people' by them!\" Chen Hui clenched his fists, his breathing becoming rapid, with only anger left in his heart.\n\n\"Don't you remember, you are a police officer!\" Old Xu said in a deep voice.\n\n\"From the day I left the police station, I'm not a damn police officer anymore!\" Chen Hui roared, his eyes turning red.\n\n\"Chen Hui, do you remember our choice?\" Old Xu's tone softened.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, I think what Chen Hui said is right. We've done enough. We're not heroes; we're just ordinary people. We get tired too! During the investigation of these cases, we all risked our lives, but no one cared. What's the point of such desperation?\" After a long period of suppression, Ning Hua's thoughts had also changed.\n\n\"I thought that by becoming a police officer, I could save people. But during this time, I've realized that this world is beyond saving!\" Ning Hua said, recalling his mother in his mind. When Ning Hua first became a police officer, he wanted to help those who were hurt. But now, Ning Hua's thoughts had changed. He desperately tried to save those who were hurt, but in the end, he was the one who got hurt.\n\nHearing Ning Hua's words, Old Xu was also stunned. He hadn't expected Ning Hua's inner beliefs to change, especially since Ning Hua's conviction had been the most steadfast among them all.\n\n\"Old Xu, maybe we really are wrong. We can play the hero once or twice, but can we keep playing it forever? This world doesn't need heroes. Everyone just wants the 'truth.' Since that's the case, what's wrong with telling them the 'truth'?\"\n\n\"You people are truly quite pathetic!\" Just as everyone was arguing, a deep voice rang out. A man in a worn-out trench coat and a full beard appeared before them.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 99 Seal",
    "content": "Chapter 99: The Mark\n\n\"Corpse Mark? What does that mean?\" Duan Tao's brows furrowed upon hearing Lu Sheng's words.\n\n\"Corpse Mark,\" Lu Sheng explained, \"the simplest explanation is a mark found on a corpse. Generally, there are two circumstances that cause a Corpse Mark. First, when cultivators die unnaturally midway through their practice, their corpses carry residual malevolence and may undergo a corpse transformation. To prevent this transformation, a Corpse Mark is carved onto the body to suppress it. Second, it's a Corpse Mark generated by the body itself after death. This type of Corpse Mark is also called a 'Ghost Mark.' Generally, individuals who are killed by 'evil spirits' do not find peace in death, and their corpses will display a type of mark.\" Lu Sheng spoke in a low voice, explaining to Duan Tao.\n\nHearing Lu Sheng's words, Duan Tao felt a chill run down his spine. Regardless of which type of Corpse Mark was on the body, for Duan Tao, it was not a good omen.\n\n\"According to the investigation, there shouldn't have been any cultivators among these seven people. In that case, their 'Corpse Marks' should be 'Ghost Marks' resulting from being killed by 'evil spirits'?\" Based on Lu Sheng's explanation, Duan Tao made a judgment combined with his own investigation.\n\n\"If it really is the second type of Corpse Mark, then it's trouble,\" Lu Sheng said with a grim face.\n\nSeeing Lu Sheng's expression, Duan Tao also felt a sense of foreboding welling up in his heart. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"As far as I know, there are no ghosts that can produce 'Corpse Marks.'\"\n\n\"No such thing? What do you mean?\" Duan Tao's confusion grew.\n\n\"Generally speaking, when people die with resentment in their hearts, they transform into 'evil spirits.' Such 'evil spirits' are the most common type. Although terrifying, they can still be subdued by those with some cultivation. However, there is another type of 'evil spirit' – those who died specifically to become 'evil spirits.'\"\n\n\"'Died to become 'evil spirits',\" Duan Tao murmured, unable to fully comprehend Lu Sheng's words.\n\n\"To give a simple example, movies and television often depict people dressed in red who commit suicide at midnight, ultimately transforming into 'evil spirits.' These types of 'evil spirits' are individuals who died with the intention of becoming 'evil spirits',\" Lu Sheng explained in great detail to Duan Tao once again.\n\nDuan Tao nodded, understanding Lu Sheng's explanation. \"So, this type of 'evil spirit' leaves a 'Corpse Mark' after harming someone?\"\n\nLu Sheng shook his head, his expression growing serious. \"The terrifying part is that even these people who died specifically to become fierce ghosts do not leave 'Corpse Marks' after harming others.\"\n\n\"You mean, there's a third type of fierce ghost?\" Duan Tao shivered, cold sweat beading on his forehead.\n\n\"Yes. Those born in an Yin year, Yin month, Yin day, and Yin hour. If such people die with the intention of becoming 'evil spirits,' they will become the most potent and terrifying 'evil spirits' with the heaviest Yin energy,\" Lu Sheng said, letting out a sigh. \"Given the current situation, if it truly is such an 'evil spirit,' let alone me, even my father, if he were alive, might not be able to subdue it.\" Although he hadn't personally experienced it, Lu Sheng had heard from his father about the disaster that would ensue if people born in an Yin year, Yin month, Yin day, and Yin hour became 'evil spirits.'\n\nAfter listening to Lu Sheng's explanation, Duan Tao's expression became extremely solemn. \"If it is truly a fierce ghost born in an Yin year, Yin month, Yin day, and Yin hour, is there really no way to subdue it?\"\n\n\"To subdue such an 'evil spirit,' relying solely on human efforts is very difficult. Unless, with the help of ghost messengers.\"\n\n\"Ghost messengers?\"\n\n\"I probably don't need to explain ghost messengers further. They are what we commonly refer to as Black and White Impermanence.\"\n\n\"'Ghost messengers are also real?\" Duan Tao murmured, a shiver running through him at the thought of them.\n\n\"Probably. I haven't seen any ghost messengers myself. My cultivation is not high enough. Generally, only those with very powerful cultivation and who have opened their 'Yin-Yang Eyes' can communicate with ghost messengers. Those who can communicate with ghost messengers are called 'Yang World Ghost Messengers.' The role of 'Yang World Ghost Messengers' is to maintain order in the living world. However, as few people truly believe in ghosts and gods in society nowadays, there are fewer cultivators with true power. Consequently, 'Yang World Ghost Messengers' are also harder to find,\" Lu Sheng said with some helplessness.\n\nThe world is balanced. When we have science, we consequently lose some things we once believed existed.\n\n\"Captain Duan, something bad has happened! Something else has happened!\" Before Duan Tao and Lu Sheng could finish their breakfast, a young man ran in, panting heavily, interrupting their conversation.\n\n\"Don't rush, what's wrong? What happened!\" Seeing the young man's panicked expression, Duan Tao spoke calmly, trying to placate him.\n\n\"Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!\" The young man gasped for air, unable to speak for a moment. Five minutes later, he finally calmed down a bit.\n\n\"Captain Duan! It's bad! Something terrible has happened!\"\n\n\"What is it? Don't rush, speak slowly,\" Duan Tao said again, trying to soothe the young man's agitated emotions.\n\n\"Last night, Captain Zhu took his team to investigate the crime scene. Just now, Captain Zhu's car was found in a cemetery in the suburbs. Including Captain Zhu, a total of five people in the car are all dead.\"\n\n\"What!\" This time, it was Duan Tao's turn to panic. He jumped up from his chair.\n\n\"The forensic team is already on their way. We should set off quickly too!\"\n\n\"Let's go!\" Duan Tao didn't hesitate. He grabbed Lu Sheng and they drove rapidly towards the crime scene.\n\nThe crime scene was located in a cemetery in the suburbs. After reaching the suburbs, Duan Tao hadn't driven far before he saw the crime scene already cordoned off by police.\n\n\"How is it?\" By the time Duan Tao and Lu Sheng arrived, the forensic team had already reached the scene and was examining the four bodies in the car.\n\n\"Preliminary identification suggests asphyxiation.\"\n\n\"Asphyxiation?\" After questioning the forensic pathologist, Duan Tao proceeded to the crime scene and saw a police car with five police officers inside.\n\n\"Captain Duan, the forensic team has identified it. Captain Zhu and the others died of asphyxiation,\" a burly police officer approached and reported to Duan Tao.\n\n\"Didn't I say to suspend the investigation? Why did Zhu Zai and the others act on their own?\" The deceased police officer was Duan Tao's subordinate, named Zhu Shan. Duan Tao had given him a nickname, \"Zhu Zai.\"\n\nThe burly police officer wore a wry smile on his face. \"Captain Duan, I don't know about that! I just arrived myself.\"\n\n\"Anything found around the crime scene?\" Duan Tao stopped asking and began to investigate the scene.\n\n\"So far, nothing has been found. The cemetery here is very remote, and it's not yet the time for tomb sweeping. So, apart from the occasional passing vehicle, no one has approached this place,\" the burly police officer began to outline the investigation results for Duan Tao. \"Additionally, according to the surveillance footage, Captain Zhu and their vehicle arrived at the cemetery around 12:35 AM tonight.\"\n\n\"All the previous crime scenes were a certain distance from here. Why did Zhu Zai and the others come all the way here?\" Duan Tao's mind began to work. All the previous cases investigated were at least 10 kilometers away from the current cemetery, yet Zhu Shan and the others came to the cemetery late at night. This was the most puzzling question for Duan Tao at the moment.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 100: Origin\n\n\"You police are quite the failures.\" Amidst the bickering of Old Xu and his team, a deep voice echoed from the darkness. Following that, a middle-aged man in a tattered trench coat and a scruffy beard slowly emerged from the shadows.\n\n\"Who are you!\" All eyes instantly focused on the middle-aged man, and a flicker of vigilance appeared on everyone's faces.\n\n\"Aren't you looking for me?\" A pale face, sunken eyes, a face that shouldn't belong to a middle-aged man, appeared before them.\n\n\"Duan Tao.\" Everyone was startled, but in the next moment, they understood. The middle-aged man, looking so aged, was the Duan Tao they had been searching for.\n\n\"It seems everyone knows me well.\" The middle-aged man spoke coldly, his aged face devoid of any expression.\n\n\"Are you Duan Tao?\" Old Xu frowned and asked in a deep voice, his mind questioning whether the middle-aged man before him was indeed Duan Tao.\n\n\"If you say I am, then I am.\" A cold smirk crossed the middle-aged man's face, and he then turned his gaze to Lu Qianxing, who stood beside Old Xu.\n\nBeing stared at by the middle-aged man made Lu Qianxing feel extremely uncomfortable.\n\n\"You're Qianxing, aren't you.\" The moment the middle-aged man saw Lu Qianxing, a smile appeared on his face.\n\nLu Qianxing was first taken aback by the question, but then he seemed to recall something. \"You? Are you really my father's friend?\" Since the other person recognized him, it meant that this aged middle-aged man was most likely his father's \"unknown friend.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man nodded slightly. \"Call me Uncle Duan.\" Unlike the voice he used when interacting with the others, his voice was now very gentle.\n\n\"Where is my father?\" Lu Qianxing asked the middle-aged man in a soft voice.\n\nUpon hearing Lu Qianxing inquire about his father, the middle-aged man's expression immediately sank. The next moment, he lowered his head, a look of deep guilt on his face. \"I'm sorry, I didn't take good care of him.\" The middle-aged man's voice was so low that Lu Qianxing could only barely hear it.\n\nLu Qianxing simply nodded slightly at the middle-aged man's response. In fact, when he had asked about his father, he had already guessed the answer.\n\n\"Your father is a hero.\" The middle-aged man suddenly said, looking at Lu Qianxing.\n\nUpon hearing this, Lu Qianxing merely let out a cold laugh. \"A hero? So what if he's a hero? To others, he might truly be a hero, but to me, he's just an unqualified husband and father who abandoned me and my mother.\"\n\nAfter hearing Lu Qianxing's words, the middle-aged man fell silent. He understood that no matter how great Lu Qianxing's father was, he was, in the end, just an \"unqualified father\" who couldn't even take care of his own child, and an \"unfaithful\" husband who left behind a gravely ill wife.\n\n\"Your father... he saved people, so...\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear about his affairs.\" Before the middle-aged man could finish, Lu Qianxing interrupted him. In fact, Lu Qianxing had been inquiring about anything related to his father before this, but for some reason, he no longer wanted to hear about his father at this moment.\n\n\"Child, I know you harbor resentment, but this is truly not your father's fault.\" The middle-aged man tried to persuade Lu Qianxing, not wanting Lu Qianxing to resent his father.\n\nLu Qianxing merely shook his head. \"It's okay, I don't resent him. I just hate him. I hate that he abandoned the people most important to him for some irrelevant people.\" As Lu Qianxing spoke, he let out a long sigh, tears glistening in his eyes.\n\nAlthough Lu Qianxing professed to hate his father, everyone present understood that Lu Qianxing truly cared about his father.\n\nAfter finishing his conversation with Lu Qianxing, the middle-aged man turned his gaze back to Old Xu and his team. \"You're investigating the 'Route 18' bus case, aren't you.\" Compared to the gentleness when speaking with Lu Qianxing, the middle-aged man's voice was now very low and cold.\n\n\"Mhm.\" Old Xu nodded. \"Do you have any clues?\"\n\n\"Based on my investigations over the years, the 'Route 18' bus case is very likely related to the case Lu Qianxing's father encountered back then.\" During the five years of the middle-aged man's decline, he had been paying attention to every case that occurred in X City.\n\n\"You know about the 'Route 18' bus case!\" Hearing the middle-aged man's words, Old Xu and the others were taken aback. Even Lu Qianxing slightly furrowed his brows.\n\n\"Mhm.\" The middle-aged man nodded. \"Five years ago, the bizarre murder case we encountered, and the current 'Route 18' bus case, are identical. Therefore, I suspect there is some connection between the case back then and the current one.\"\n\n\"What exactly happened back then!\" Although they had just been discussing abandonment, now that there was a clue, everyone calmed down and listened intently to the middle-aged man's account.\n\n\"Five years ago, we encountered a bizarre murder case. Initially, no matter how we investigated, we couldn't find any clues. Finally, when I met Qianxing's father, with his help, we found the culprit of the bizarre murder case. It was a vengeful mother who had died by suicide by jumping off a building, who had transformed into a malevolent spirit.\"\n\nAs the middle-aged man reached this point, everyone's minds recalled the story they had heard from Ye He earlier, a story about a \"little girl with a heart condition.\"\n\n\"Is the mother you're talking about, who transformed into a malevolent spirit, the mother of the little girl in my father's遗留 diary¹?\" Lu Qianxing asked the middle-aged man on behalf of everyone.\n\nUpon hearing Lu Qianxing's question, the middle-aged man immediately replied, \"Mhm. According to our investigation back then, the 'malevolent spirit murder' incident was the mother of that little girl.\"\n\n\"This way, it proves that this story truly exists, and our previous speculation might be correct!\" Lu Qianxing thought of the speculation previously made by Ye Bin and Zhang Lan.\n\n\"Did everything in the case originate from this 'little girl'?\" Old Xu murmured. He had also heard about the speculation of Ye Bin and Zhang Lan.\n\n\"If it truly originated from this 'little girl,' then the 'Route 18' bus case could be the work of the 'little girl's' mother, who transformed into a malevolent spirit?\" Zhao Zhen frowned, voicing his conjecture.\n\n\"The 'little girl's' mother was already sent to peace by Qianxing's father five years ago.\" The middle-aged man negated Zhao Zhen's conjecture.\n\n\"If it wasn't the 'little girl's' mother, then it must be the little girl's father.\" Zhao Zhen then shifted his focus to the \"little girl's\" father.\n\n\"Based on the current situation, the possibility of the 'little girl's' father being the killer is indeed the greatest. However, can a human being achieve such things?\" Old Xu frowned. Given the curse of the 'Route 18' bus, Old Xu didn't believe this was something an ordinary person could do.\n\n\"Don't forget, the 'little girl's' father was a Taoist priest.\" Lu Qianxing said, reminding Old Xu.\n\n(End of Chapter)\n\n¹ *Yíliú (遗留)* literally translates to \"left behind\" or \"bequeathed.\" In this context, it implies a diary that was left behind by Lu Qianxing's father, likely after his death or disappearance.",

    "content": "**Chapter 101: Captain Duan**\n\nWith the push of some media outlets, public opinion in X City reached its peak, with some netizens fanning the flames. Even more outrageously, after the public opinion fermented, a post appeared online that was widely propagating.\n\n\"Bullshit! What the hell is all this nonsense? Those damned bastards! They really are afraid the world isn't chaotic enough!\" In the police station, a police officer in his fifties, seeing the various rumors online, was so angry he almost passed out.\n\nBeside the elderly officer, a tall officer in his early forties handed a document to the older man.\n\n\"What is this?\" After taking the document from the tall officer, the elderly officer began to flip through it. But after only a few pages, the elderly officer slammed the document he was holding onto the desk. \"I @#￥@#!\" The elderly officer was so angry he started swearing, his whole body trembling.\n\n\"Liu San, that little turtle, to pull this stunt on me at this time.\" The elderly officer gritted his teeth, wishing he could crush Liu San in his hand.\n\nLiu San was a small-time hoodlum in X City. He had been arrested by the elderly officer for gathering a crowd to fight and was imprisoned for nearly two years. During his time in prison, Liu San harbored deep resentment towards the elderly officer. He was released recently and upon hearing news of recent events in X City, Liu San, with a desire for revenge against the police, gathered a gang of his cronies and, using media speculation, disrupted public order.\n\n\"Damn, I really don't want to do this anymore. Ever since Captain Duan left, this police station hasn't had a moment's peace; it's been one thing after another!\" the elderly officer complained.\n\n\"Uncle Cao, now is not the time to talk about this. We still need to figure out how to solve the problem. If this continues, it will lead to big trouble.\"\n\n\"I know it will lead to big trouble, but what can we do? With just a few of us, we can't solve this matter at all. At most, we can just arrest that little turtle Liu San! Anything else can only be handled by those above,\" the elderly officer sighed, feeling a sense of helplessness.\n\n\"If only Captain Duan were still here, maybe he could have found some way,\" the tall officer also sighed, feeling very helpless.\n\n\"It's been over five years since that case was closed. Damn it, I really regret not standing up for Captain Duan back then, letting him take the blame for nothing. And that person back then, alas...\" At the end, the elderly officer, referred to as \"Uncle Cao,\" shook his head with some guilt.\n\n\"Uncle Cao, you can't blame yourself for that.\" Although he was comforting Uncle Cao, the tall officer, in his heart, felt the same guilt as Uncle Cao.\n\nAs Uncle Cao and the tall officer were reflecting on their guilt about the past, a young police officer who had been there for less than half a year walked in.\n\n\"Uncle Cao, Brother Xiong, there's a beggar dressed in rags outside who claims to be looking for Brother Ah Hua. I figured we don't have anyone named Ah Hua here, so I told him to leave. But that person refused to leave and insisted I come in to ask, saying there's definitely someone named Ah Hua here.\"\n\n\"Brother Ah Hua!\" Hearing the new officer's words, both Uncle Cao and the tall officer were stunned.\n\nSeeing this, the new officer was also a bit bewildered, wondering if there really was someone named \"Brother Ah Hua.\"\n\n\"Where is that person now?\"\n\n\"He's still waiting outside the police station, but he's dressed in rags. I think he's a beggar.\"\n\n\"What beggar! That's Captain Duan!\" Uncle Cao glared at the new officer, speaking coldly, which immediately made the new officer freeze in place, not daring to make a sound.\n\nUncle Cao and the tall officer jogged hurriedly to the entrance of the police station. Upon seeing the middle-aged man in a worn-out trench coat outside the station, a hint of excited smiles appeared on Uncle Cao and the tall officer's faces.\n\n\"Captain Duan! It's really you!\"\n\n\"Long time no see.\" A long-lost smile appeared on the middle-aged man's face, bringing tears to the eyes of Uncle Cao and the tall officer.\n\nUnder the personal reception of Uncle Cao and the tall officer, Duan Tao entered the police station. The new officer who had just come in was completely bewildered. He had never seen Uncle Cao and the tall officer treat anyone with such respect, especially someone he had previously mistaken for a \"beggar.\"\n\n\"I don't know if it's true or not, but my former captain said there was a particularly formidable police officer in the station who resigned because of a case. Judging by how Uncle Cao and Brother Xiong look now, this person is likely that police officer from back then.\" A police officer who had been there for half a year longer than the new officer stood beside the new officer, patting his shoulder, and said slowly.\n\n\"Was that person's name 'Captain Duan'?\" the new officer asked, having heard Uncle Cao and the tall officer call Duan Tao by name earlier.\n\n\"Captain Duan... I think so.\" The officer who had been there for a year scratched his head, thinking.\n\n\"Captain Duan, why have you come? How have you been all these years?\" Upon entering his office, Uncle Cao was the first to speak, asking Duan Tao about his life.\n\n\"I've been living at a friend's place,\" Duan Tao replied with a smile.\n\n\"Captain Duan, your physical condition doesn't look very good.\" The tall officer was concerned about Duan Tao's health, as Duan Tao now appeared quite aged.\n\n\"Indeed, looking at you, it seems you're older than me. What's going on? Did you time travel!\" Uncle Cao said in a joking tone.\n\n\"Brother Ah Hua, it's been many years, and you still love to joke.\" Hearing Uncle Cao's joke, Duan Tao also smiled.\n\n\"Ah, what joke? It's good to see you. I haven't joked with anyone for a long time these past few years. I'm getting old, my body can't keep up, and I should retire. And you? Are you planning to come back this time? If you are, I might consider retiring a little later,\" Uncle Cao said with a laugh.\n\nHearing Uncle Cao's words, Duan Tao simply shook his head. \"No, I just missed you guys and came to see you.\"\n\n\"Alas, you rascal. I might not know others, but I know you. You've come back this time for the recent case, haven't you?\" Uncle Cao had already guessed the purpose of Duan Tao's visit.\n\n\"Brother Ah Hua is indeed Brother Ah Hua; your charisma hasn't diminished over the years,\" Duan Tao smiled, not deliberately hiding his purpose. In fact, Duan Tao had made up his mind to change his current situation by returning this time.\n\n\"It's good that you've returned, otherwise, I really wouldn't know what to do.\" Uncle Cao said, letting out a sigh of relief, a smile of relief appearing on his face. \"Since you left, we've been plagued by problems everywhere. Do you remember Liu San? That guy has surfaced again. This time, it's rumored that little punk is the mastermind.\"\n\n\"Liu San?\"\n\n\"Yes! It's perfect that you're back; please help us deal with that little turtle.\"\n\n\"That's right, Captain Duan. The police station is like a soul-less body without you,\" the tall officer chimed in.\n\nTo this, Duan Tao shook his head. \"Brother Ah Hua, Xiao Tong, I'm not returning as a police officer this time. When I left five years ago, I was no longer a police officer.\"\n\n\"Whether you're a police officer or not isn't important. I only know that you are Captain Duan!\" Uncle Cao immediately responded to Duan Tao's words, which made Duan Tao pause.\n\n\"Yes, since you're back, no matter your identity, the police station needs you,\" the tall officer said, extending his right hand towards Duan Tao.\n\nSeeing the sincere smiles on Uncle Cao and the tall officer's faces, Duan Tao smiled slightly and then reached out to shake the tall officer's hand.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 102: Beyond Hope\n\n“No one is forcing you to persevere. Perhaps, as you say, this world is already ‘beyond hope,’ but I hope you understand that if everyone gives up, then this world will truly be ‘beyond hope.’”\n\nThe words Duan Tao spoke before leaving plunged Chen Hui and his companions, who had been contemplating giving up, into deep thought.\n\nPreviously, when facing Old Xu, everyone could still argue their case with confidence. However, when facing Duan Tao, they realized they didn’t even have the chance to retort.\n\nIf the person abandoned by the world chose to persevere, then what right did they have to speak of giving up?\n\n“Uncle Xu, I apologize for what happened before.” Chen Hui looked at Old Xu, his face filled with remorse as he bowed deeply.\n\nOld Xu didn’t say anything, merely patting Chen Hui’s shoulder lightly. “No need to apologize to me. If I were you, perhaps my thoughts would be the same as yours.”\n\n“Uncle Xu, I’m sorry. I lost my composure before. ‘Beyond hope’ isn’t this world, it’s myself.” Following Chen Hui, Ning Hua also took the initiative to apologize to Old Xu.\n\n“Ning Hua, I hope you remember why you are standing here.” Old Xu offered only one sentence to Ning Hua.\n\n“Uncle Xu, don’t worry, I understand.” Ning Hua nodded and spoke with solemnity.\n\nAs Chen Hui and Ning Hua were apologizing to Old Xu, Zhao Zhen walked over to Old Xu’s side but did not speak.\n\n“Old Zhao, you and I are both old. If even I give up, who will persevere?” Although Zhao Zhen hadn’t spoken, Old Xu said in a deep voice, questioning him.\n\n“You’re so old, you don’t even spare me any face. Alright, I know I was wrong.” Zhao Zhen shook his head, appearing helpless.\n\nSeeing Zhao Zhen’s helpless expression, Old Xu burst into laughter. At the same time, Chen Hui and Ning Hua also started laughing heartily.\n\nLu Qianxing sat alone in a corner, staring blankly ahead, oblivious to the conversation between Old Xu and the others.\n\n“This child Qianxing has a tough life.” After the laughter subsided, Old Xu and the others turned their attention to Lu Qianxing. They all understood that Lu Qianxing must be feeling immense pain in his heart at this moment.\n\n“Will he be alright?” Chen Hui asked with some concern.\n\n“Shall we go try to comfort him?” Ning Hua said, about to step forward to persuade Lu Qianxing.\n\nOld Xu stopped Ning Hua, shaking his head. “Let him have some quiet time alone. That child is very strong; he’ll be fine.” Having known Lu Qianxing for some time, Old Xu could tell that Lu Qianxing was not someone who could be easily defeated.\n\nAnd so, Old Xu and his companions stood behind Lu Qianxing, no one speaking, merely accompanying him in silence. After a long while, Lu Qianxing seemed to snap out of his thoughts. He turned to look at Old Xu and the others, a smile appearing on his face.\n\n“What are you all standing behind me for? Acting like guardians?”\n\n“Yeah! We were afraid you’d be scared and cry alone, so we’re standing behind you!” Chen Hui joked.\n\n“Uh…” Lu Qianxing frowned, then spread his hands, and finally smiled. “Thank you!”\n\n“Since we’ve figured out Duan Tao’s situation, there’s no point in continuing to monitor Han Xuelan. Let’s hurry back and meet up with Bin Zi and the others.” Old Xu’s proposal was unanimously approved. Afterward, everyone rushed back to Lin Xiao’s villa to rendezvous with Ye Bin and Zhang Lan.\n\nMeanwhile, despite the ongoing public outcry, none of it affected Lin Xiao. In order to investigate the two recent cases, Lin Xiao had been rushing around, trying to find clues.\n\n“Captain Lin, you’ve watched these surveillance videos more than ten times. There really isn’t any ‘woman carrying an iron bucket and burning paper money’.” In the most recent case, the ‘man slitting his wrist to commit suicide’ near the “No. 18” bus stop, Lin Xiao repeatedly watched all the surveillance footage from the surrounding streets. He had watched each video at least ten times but still couldn’t find any issues. The staff responsible for retrieving the surveillance footage were getting impatient.\n\n“Have the personal information of the suicide victim and the missing person been investigated?” Lin Xiao directly ignored the staff member retrieving the footage and turned to a young police officer beside him.\n\n“Yes, it’s been investigated. These two individuals were employees of Tianmao Company. The one who committed suicide is named Zhao Qing, and the missing one is Gao Zhijie. That night, because the company had overtime, they left work very late. According to the surveillance footage from Tianmao Company, they left work at 11:47 PM and headed back to their apartment building. They arrived at the crime scene around 12:30 AM.” The young police officer said this as he handed the document in his hand to Lin Xiao.\n\n“Oh, right, Captain Lin. The footprints from the amusement park case you asked me to investigate earlier? After investigation, they belong to a child around seven or eight years old. We also found a pair of shoes that match the footprints. Those shoes are in a girl’s style, but this style only appeared five years ago.”\n\n“Appeared five years ago? Were those shoes limited edition?” Lin Xiao inquired.\n\nTo Lin Xiao’s question, the young police officer shook his head. “No, those shoes were manufactured by a children’s clothing factory in the city and were only sold in City X. After the children’s clothing factory underwent a transformation five years ago, these shoes became discontinued.” The young police officer’s investigation was very thorough.\n\n“Five years ago.” Lin Xiao murmured, falling into a brief period of thought. A moment later, Lin Xiao asked another question. “What about the personal information of the two deceased and two missing individuals from the amusement park? Any progress?”\n\n“According to the investigation, the four people in the amusement park were all streamers. That night, they went to the amusement park for an adventure to gain traffic.”\n\n“Anything else?” Lin Xiao pressed.\n\n“As for anything else, we haven’t uncovered any new leads yet.”\n\n“Continue the investigation. I want to know the interpersonal relationships and detailed living situations of the two deceased and two missing individuals. Of course, the same applies to the two employees of Tianmao Company.”\n\n“Understood.” The young police officer nodded, said nothing more, and turned to leave, continuing the investigation as per Lin Xiao’s request.\n\n“Download all the surveillance videos for me. I’m going back to watch them again.” After the young police officer left, Lin Xiao instructed the staff member retrieving the surveillance footage to download all the surveillance records.\n\n“Captain Lin, you’ve watched them so many times, is there still any point in downloading them?” The staff member retrieving the surveillance footage looked helpless.\n\n“I’m just telling you to download them. Is there a problem?” Captain Lin asked coldly, his gaze calmly fixed on the staff member retrieving the surveillance footage.\n\nSeeing Lin Xiao’s demeanor, the staff member retrieving the surveillance footage was stunned for a moment, then shook his head. “No problem, no problem.”\n\n“Good. If there’s no problem, send them to me when they’re done.” Lin Xiao said, without lingering, and turned to leave.\n\n“Captain Lin, where are we going now?” Beside Lin Xiao, a police officer in his early forties asked respectfully. Although he was not as old as Lin Xiao, he had heard of Lin Xiao’s various deeds and therefore respected him greatly.\n\n“The crime scene.”\n\n“Okay.” Although Lin Xiao had investigated the crime scene more than once, the police officer in his early forties had no doubts about Lin Xiao’s methods. As long as Lin Xiao gave an order, he would obey it absolutely.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 103: Investigation Results and Judgment\n\n\"Dad, I want to live, save me! Save me! Save me!\" In the endless abyss, a pair of hands desperately struggled upwards. Tears of despair dripped down a young face, and a pained voice screamed.\n\n\"Daughter! Daughter!\" A rough large hand desperately reached into the abyss, trying to grab the hands within. But unfortunately, no matter how hard the rough large hand stretched forward, there was always an invisible barrier between the large hand and the hands in the abyss, making them unable to connect.\n\n\"Ah!\" On the cold ground, a raggedly dressed man suddenly sat up, cold sweat constantly beading on his forehead. He looked as if he had just emerged from the abyss. \"Daughter! Daughter! My daughter!\" The man stared at his own hands, roaring in despair, clenching them tightly. \"Why! Why can't I grab him! Grab his hand! Why! Ah!\" His clenched fists hammered against the ground, drawing blood, but the man felt no pain.\n\nAfter the surveillance of Han Xuelan and the investigation into Duan Tao concluded, Old Xu and his team returned to the villa provided by Lin Xiao, where they reunited with Ye Bin and Zhang Lan.\n\nUpon seeing everyone return, Zhang Lan was the first to step forward, asking Old Xu and his team with some anxiety.\n\n\"How did it go? Did the investigation yield any results?\"\n\n\"Our previous guess was correct. Duan Tao is indeed that unknown friend of Qian Xing's father,\" Old Xu replied, answering Zhang Lan's question.\n\n\"What about you guys? Did Li Chao's side have any leads?\" Old Xu was still concerned about Li Chao's safety.\n\nHearing Old Xu ask about Li Chao, Zhang Lan's brow immediately furrowed.\n\nSeeing Zhang Lan frown, Old Xu realized something had happened. \"Lan Pang, why are you frowning? Is it that kid Li Chao...\" Old Xu fell silent here, his mind racing with the worst possible outcome.\n\n\"Things are a bit complicated,\" Zhang Lan said, his face grave, contemplating how to explain the situation to Old Xu.\n\n\"Complicated with what? What happened? Is that kid Li Chao okay?\" Old Xu asked anxiously.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, don't be in a hurry. Brother Lan is right. Things are indeed a bit complicated and need to be explained slowly.\" Ye Bin, seeing Old Xu losing control of his emotions, quickly intervened to persuade him.\n\nHearing Ye Bin's persuasion, Old Xu managed to calm himself down and then looked at Ye Bin. \"Binzi, you tell me, what exactly happened.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Ye Bin nodded and, without further ado, began to narrate the events concerning Li Chao.\n\n\"Just now, Detective Lin had his assistant, Fang Chen, investigate the matter of Li Chao and his son. The result was a shocking discovery. According to Fang Chen's investigation, Li Chao and his son died in an accident five years ago.\" As soon as Ye Bin finished speaking, everyone's faces, except for Zhang Lan's, immediately sank.\n\n\"Died five years ago? What does that mean?\" Chen Hui asked Ye Bin with a face full of confusion, doubting if he had heard correctly.\n\n\"Fang Chen found Li Chao and his son's family. According to their accounts, Li Chao and his son died in an accident five years ago,\" Zhang Lan elaborated in more detail.\n\n\"Could it be that Li Chao and his son didn't die, and their family just doesn't know about it?\" Ning Hua raised a question.\n\n\"If you put it that way, it is indeed possible,\" Zhao Zhen agreed with Ning Hua's idea.\n\n\"Considering Lin Xiao's meticulousness, do you think he wouldn't consider such a possibility?\" Old Xu's voice was cold. Although his expression appeared relatively calm, Old Xu felt an unspeakable sense of oppression within.\n\nLu Qianxing, standing at the back, had been frowning upon hearing the news about Li Chao and his son, but had not spoken.\n\n\"If that's the case, could the people involved in the other cases be the same as Li Chao and his son?\" Chen Hui analyzed perceptively.\n\n\"That point doesn't hold up. Fang Chen didn't find any records of their accidental deaths in their files. However, Fang Chen did find reports of their accidental deaths in a newspaper from five years ago. As for the other deceased, Fang Chen has investigated their detailed information, but found no abnormalities,\" Zhang Lan provided a precise answer to Chen Hui's analysis.\n\n\"You can't say that. Not finding abnormalities in the records doesn't mean there aren't any.\" Zhao Zhen, who had been a police officer for half his life, understood that some special cases wouldn't be recorded in the files.\n\n\"Indeed. Earlier, when investigating Li Chao and his son's files, Fang Chen mentioned that it seemed like someone had tampered with them,\" Ye Bin nodded, agreeing with Zhao Zhen's thought.\n\n\"If that's the case, then it's impossible to determine if the other deceased are consistent with Li Chao and the other.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that the previous Li Chao was dead.\" While everyone was discussing, Lu Qianxing, who had been standing at the back and hadn't spoken, suddenly interjected.\n\nUpon hearing this, everyone's gaze instantly shifted to Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" Zhang Lan asked, confused.\n\n\"I've met Li Chao before. Although my cultivation isn't deep enough, I can at least tell whether he's dead or not. Generally speaking, 'deceased' people have a strong 'yin energy'¹ surrounding them. But Li Chao is different. While he does have 'yin energy,' I believe it doesn't originate from him, but rather from something unclean that has attached itself to him.\" Lu Qianxing recalled their first meeting with Li Chao, where he had observed him carefully, and was thus certain that Li Chao was not dead, but merely had something unclean clinging to him.\n\n\"The case is getting more and more complicated.\" Between Fang Chen's investigation and Lu Qianxing's judgment, the case had fallen into a stalemate.\n\n\"I believe Qian Xing's judgment,\" Old Xu was the first to speak, making his choice. In Old Xu's heart, he couldn't accept the idea that Li Chao was dead.\n\n\"Old Xu, don't be too impulsive. This is an investigation, and solving cases requires evidence,\" Zhao Zhen felt that Old Xu's choice was somewhat driven by emotion.\n\n\"Qian Xing, can you trust your own judgment?\" When everyone was unsure whom to believe, Ye Bin spoke gravely, asking Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"As a Taoist priest, if I can't even figure out this much, then I'm probably a fake Taoist priest,\" Lu Qianxing replied with a shrug, speaking humorously to Ye Bin's question.\n\n\"Good, I also believe Qian Xing's judgment.\" After hearing Lu Qianxing's words, Ye Bin directly made his choice.\n\n\"The results of the investigation can be tampered with, but a person's intuition cannot. Although I don't know exactly what's going on, I also believe Qian Xing. The Li Chao we saw wasn't dead.\" Chen Hui placed more trust in Lu Qianxing's judgment than Fang Chen's investigation.\n\n\"You guys are making me feel very awkward,\" Zhao Zhen said with a helpless expression and finally walked to Lu Qianxing's side. \"Alright, alright! I believe you too.\"\n\n\"Old Zhao, forced acceptance isn't a good thing.\"\n\n\"Old Xu, you old rascal, you're really not a good person!\" Zhao Zhen rolled his eyes at Old Xu and said coldly.\n\nIn the end, Ye Bin and the others all chose Lu Qianxing. In the face of the investigation results, they decided to believe Lu Qianxing's judgment.\n\n(End of Chapter)\n\n¹ **Yin energy (陰氣):** In traditional Chinese beliefs, yin energy is a vital force associated with cold, darkness, and the passive principle. In the context of the supernatural, a strong presence of yin energy around a person is often an indication of being affected by spirits or other malevolent forces.",

    "content": "CHAPTER 104: BESIEGED\n\n\"Brother Liu, those cops are being blocked at the police station by the public every day, they can't go anywhere. It's really great! Haha!\"\n\n\"Yeah! Brother Liu is amazing. The police are overwhelmed every day and can't bother with us brothers! Haha!\"\n\n\"That's right. Without police protection, those merchants are all obedient now. The rent I collect in a day is several times more than before.\" A hooligan, covered in dense tattoos, pulled out a wad of cash from his pocket, proudly showing it off.\n\n\"Hurry up! Hand it over to Brother Liu. If it wasn't for Brother Liu this time, we brothers wouldn't be so comfortable.\"\n\n\"Who said that!\"\n\nOutside a skewer shop, nearly 20 ruffians were sitting together, all reeking of alcohol.\n\nDue to the public outcry in X City, the police were targeted by the public, leading to some social disorder. Some lawbreakers formed gangs and took advantage of the situation, threatening numerous shops for protection fees during this period. The mastermind behind these gatherings was none other than Liu San, who had previously been arrested by Cao Hua and was now released from prison.\n\nLiu San held a cigarette, wore a leather trench coat, and had a smug look on his face. \"Hmph, the police nowadays are vulnerable. With a little strategy from Liu, they're finished! Hahaha!\" Liu San spoke contemptuously, showing no regard for the police.\n\n\"Brother Liu, we've been so wild lately. If the storm in X City passes in a while, will those police cause trouble for us?\" a hooligan asked Liu San. Although their lives were very comfortable now, this hooligan still thought about what would happen later.\n\n\"Trouble? What trouble? Judging by the current situation, the storm in X City won't pass anytime soon. Even if it does, we can just lay low for a while,\" a bare-chested man said dismissively, not worried about any consequences.\n\n\"Don't worry. The few powerful guys in X City right now are all tied down by public opinion and can't even save themselves. They won't have the leisure time to look for us. As for later, even if there's trouble, we can just hide for a few days. We have so many people, I doubt the police station can even accommodate us. Hahaha.\" Liu San said this, picked up a bottle of wine, and gulped it down.\n\nSeeing this, the other hooligans raised their wine glasses and toasted Liu San.\n\n\"Long live Brother Liu!\"\n\n\"Long live Brother Liu!\"\n\nFor a time, the cry of \"Long live Brother Liu\" spread through the streets and alleys. Although the people around hated these hooligans to the bone, no one dared to step forward and confront them.\n\nJust as Liu San and the group of hooligans were getting into high spirits, police sirens suddenly sounded around them. Then, before the hooligans could react, over a dozen police cars with sirens blaring stopped at the entrance of the skewer shop, surrounding the area tightly.\n\nSeeing this scene, everyone, including Liu San, was somewhat surprised. How could so many police cars appear so suddenly?\n\n\"Brother Liu, what's going on!\" Among the hooligans, some began to panic inexplicably upon seeing the police cars.\n\n\"Don't be afraid. We're just drinking here. I'd like to see what they're going to do.\" Although Liu San was surprised, he remained remarkably calm. After finishing his cigarette, he casually flicked the butt aside.\n\nDozens of police cars surrounded the skewer shop, with sirens wailing continuously. However, not a single police officer got out of any of the police cars, causing the besieged hooligans to become restless.\n\n\"Are we going to be arrested?\"\n\n\"It's over! If we get caught, we'll be locked up for at least half a year.\"\n\n\"Brother Liu! What do we do now!\" Not everyone could remain as calm as Liu San. Facing the encirclement of police cars, the hooligans began to panic, and some even lost control, constantly asking Liu San what to do.\n\nSeeing that the situation was getting out of control, Liu San knew that if this continued, trouble would surely arise. So, he stood up and questioned the police cars with sirens blaring around them.\n\n\"Hey! Uncle Police! With such a large display, have you found the murderer in X City?\"\n\nThe moment Liu San spoke, all the sirens stopped instantly, but the scene remained the same. No one got out of any of the police cars, and no one answered Liu San's question.\n\n\"Hey! Police! Speak up! What's the meaning of surrounding us here!\" Liu San's heart began to panic as no police officer answered him.\n\n\"Brother Liu, what's going on! Why aren't these police saying anything.\" A hooligan closest to Liu San had a pale face, clearly frightened by the scene.\n\n\"Yeah, Brother Liu, will something happen.\" Compared to Liu San, the hooligans were in a worse state, with their minds racing, not knowing what was happening.\n\n\"It's nothing! These police are just putting on a show. We haven't committed any crimes, so there's no need to be afraid of them!\" Liu San said coldly, trying to stabilize the hooligans' emotions. In reality, Liu San himself felt a trace of fear and was looking around for an escape route to slip away.\n\n\"Brother Liu, who says we haven't! I was still collecting rent before I came! Maybe these police are here for us!\" One hooligan had already been scared out of his wits and said with a tremor.\n\n\"Shut up! If you don't say it, and I don't say it, how will the police know!\" Liu San yelled sternly, and at this moment, his own fear grew even deeper.\n\nJust as the hooligans were filled with fear, the headlights of dozens of police cars suddenly lit up, blindingly bright, turning the night into day.\n\n\"Ah! Uncle Police! I haven't done anything wrong! I was just collecting rent, I'll return the money.\" A hooligan, illuminated by the police car headlights, was instantly scared out of his wits. He took out a wad of cash from his pocket, held it over his head, and knelt on the ground.\n\n\"Damn it, you piece of trash!\" Liu San kicked the hooligan in the back.\n\nThe hooligan fell to the ground but did not get up. Instead, he lay on the ground, mumbling, \"I'll never do it again! I'll never do it again.\"\n\nAs the hooligans were filled with fear under the glare of the police car headlights, a voice came from one of the police cars through a loudspeaker.\n\n\"I'll give you one minute to confess your crimes. Lie on the ground, and it can be considered a voluntary surrender, with a lighter punishment. Otherwise, if we find out, based on your actions, I think you can consider enjoying a few years in prison.\" The voice from the loudspeaker was extremely cold, causing all the hooligans to freeze.\n\nNone of the hooligans present, including Liu San, were clean. Therefore, upon hearing the voice from the police car, all the hooligans had the thought of confessing immediately to seek leniency.\n\n\"Don't fall for it, everyone! If you confess here, it's all over! Without evidence, they can't arrest us randomly!\" Seeing that several hooligans had already confessed and were lying on the ground, Liu San hurriedly incited the other hooligans, fearing that everyone would confess at that moment.\n\n\"Brother Liu, I have old parents and young children. If I get caught, it's over! If I surrender now, maybe the punishment will be lighter, and I'll only be locked up for a few months.\" Under Liu San's incitement, a hooligan expressed his thoughts.\n\n\"Damn it! You piece of trash!\" Liu San gritted his teeth, his heart growing more flustered.\n\n\"Damn it, who is it! To pull off something like this!\" Liu San, enduring the police car headlights, looked at the police cars, trying to see who was inside the vehicle making the announcement. However, under the blinding lights, Liu San could see nothing.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 105: Public Opinion Calms Down\n\nAccording to our station's latest report, at 8:35 PM tonight, police apprehended a group of thugs led by suspect \"Liu San\" near Qinghua Street in X City. So far, over twenty suspects have confessed.\n\nNews reports about the police's sudden crackdown on \"thugs\" in X City have flooded major television stations and news websites.\n\n\"Did you see the news? They say they caught Liu San, that little runt.\"\n\n\"Saw it, saw it. Finally, they got rid of a menace to society. They say this Liu San was incredibly arrogant, claiming he could do whatever he wanted in X City!\"\n\n\"Even though Liu San was arrested, X City isn't just about Liu San, right? I remember there's another guy in Xinhuan called 'Master Ba' who's also apparently very arrogant, even more so than Liu San.\"\n\n\"Yeah, X City has been turbulent lately, making these damned 'thugs' more rampant than ever. I think arresting just Liu San isn't enough; they should arrest 'Master Ba' too.\" Although the public cheered Liu San's arrest, some worried that he alone wasn't enough. Recently, there have been far more \"thugs\" emerging in X City than before.\n\n\"I think since Liu San was arrested, 'Master Ba' will be caught soon.\"\n\n\"Let's hope so.\"\n\nFollowing the news of \"Liu San's\" arrest, the previous disturbances in X City were temporarily forgotten by the public. Rumors of \"haunted police stations\" on major media outlets slipped off the front pages, replaced by the \"Liu San\" arrest. Moreover, with \"Liu San's\" capture, citizens who had previously questioned the police ceased directing their criticism at them, and crowds blocking police stations dispersed.\n\nWith the public's attention shifting away from the police, their focus now turned to other thugs in X City. Currently, besides \"Liu San,\" \"Master Ba\" is the most notorious, and instantly became the focus of public discussion.\n\n\"'Liu San' caught, how long until 'Master Ba'?\"\n\n\"Police and public cooperation: Finding 'Master Ba'.\"\n\n\"'Master Ba,' where are you? Justice may be delayed, but it will not be denied.\" The homepages of major news websites were filled with posts about \"Master Ba.\" In an instant, the citizens of X City were united, with a single target: \"Master Ba.\"\n\n\"This Duan Tao is truly something!\" Ye Bin and his companions stood before the television, watching news reports about \"Master Ba,\" all expressing heartfelt admiration for Duan Tao.\n\n\"Indeed! 'Liu San's' arrest successfully shifted public attention. This way, we'll have more time to investigate the 'Route 18' bus case,\" Ning Hua remarked.\n\n\"While that's true, the matters of 'Liu San' and 'Master Ba' will only divert public attention for a while. Once a new case occurs, public scrutiny will immediately shift back,\" Old Xu stated gravely, making a more accurate judgment of the current situation.\n\n\"Regardless, Duan Tao's move has given us a breathing room and allowed X City, which was on the verge of collapse, to stand up again. However, we don't have much time. Before the next case happens, we must gather some clues and find the culprit behind the 'Route 18' bus case as soon as possible,\" Ye Bin frowned and said coldly.\n\nJust three days after \"Liu San's\" arrest, the police struck again with lightning speed, successfully apprehending \"Master Ba.\" This time, the operation was led not by Duan Tao, but by Lin Xiao.\n\nThe moment \"Liu San\" was arrested, Lin Xiao understood everything. He immediately dispatched several officers to search X City for clues about \"Master Ba.\" On the morning of the third day, the police successfully located \"Master Ba.\" Following this, Lin Xiao ordered the deployment of almost half of the police force, with the largest possible show of force, to arrest \"Master Ba.\"\n\nAs expected, after \"Master Ba\" was captured, the citizens of X City erupted in cheers, and major news media outlets praised the police.\n\n\"The X City police are truly amazing!\"\n\n\"Yes! Their response was so fast. Within just three days, they arrested both 'Liu San' and 'Master Ba,' bringing great relief.\"\n\n\"Speaking of which, besides 'Liu San' and 'Master Ba,' are there any others? Yes, strike while the iron is hot, arrest people while it's early. They should round up all the criminals now!\"\n\nAfter the arrests of \"Liu San\" and \"Master Ba,\" netizens online united in their desire to uproot all criminals who posed a threat to X City.\n\nIn less than a week, the police made multiple moves, rounding up all potential threats to X City!\n\nDuring this period, without the interference of public opinion and the masses, Ye Bin's team and Lin Xiao's team worked diligently to find clues, as everyone understood that time was running out. Once the spotlight on \"Liu San\" and \"Master Ba\" faded, the public would immediately shift their attention back.\n\n\"Based on the clues we have, our primary goals are to identify the 'mysterious woman burning joss paper' and, secondly, to find 'Li Chao' as quickly as possible.\" After discussions, Ye Bin summarized the two most crucial leads for the current case.\n\n\"Easier said than done. Finding either the 'mysterious woman burning joss paper' or 'Li Chao' is no easy task, especially since we have no clues to find them yet,\" Chen Hui felt that without any leads, they could only start from scratch in finding these two.\n\n\"I saw the 'mysterious woman burning joss paper' once before, so I'll take charge of that. As for 'Li Chao,' I'll leave that to Uncle Xu.\"\n\nOld Xu nodded at Ye Bin's division of labor, \"Mm, this time, I'll have Qian Xing go with you. After all, it's still uncertain whether the 'mysterious woman burning joss paper' is human or ghost.\" Old Xu assigned Lu Qianxing to accompany Ye Bin and the others in their investigation, also to ensure Ye Bin and his team's safety.\n\n\"Alright, after this, we'll stick to the previous groupings. I, Brother Lan, and Chen Hui will be one team. Uncle Xu, Uncle Zhao, and Brother Hua will be another.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Everyone nodded at Ye Bin's team division without any objection.\n\n\"By the way, what about Lin Xiao's side? Should we tell him about Li Chao?\" Ning Hua asked.\n\n\"For now, let's not. After all, there's a personal motive involved with Li Chao, and Detective Lin might not believe us.\" After interacting with Lin Xiao these past few days, Ye Bin understood that Lin Xiao was a man who valued evidence, and it would be difficult to convince him without it. \"However, if other issues arise, we can contact him for assistance.\"\n\n\"Understood!\"\n\nAfter the team division, Old Xu and his two companions set out to investigate clues related to Li Chao. Ye Bin's group, due to Ye Bin and Zhang Lan's mobility issues, would focus on online research. Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing would head to the locations where the \"mysterious woman burning joss paper\" had appeared to investigate.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 106: Investigation\n\nTo investigate the clue of the \"mysterious woman burning joss paper,\" Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui traveled together, investigating all locations where the \"mysterious woman burning joss paper\" was suspected to have appeared. Meanwhile, Old Xu and the other two visited various places, searching for clues about \"Li Chao and his son.\"\n\n\"This is the first location where we found 'half-burned joss paper.' The killer in that case has still not been found,\" Chen Hui said, recounting the case. Suddenly, he remembered something and turned to Lu Qianxing beside him. \"Right, Qianxing, I remember you saying back then that a lonely spirit told you the victim's name was 'Li Nan.' However, according to the police's subsequent investigation, the victim here was a homeless man named 'Shi Tao.'\"\n\nThe matter of \"Li Nan\" had been discussed by everyone back then. However, due to the \"Ghost Standing in the Grave\" incident, everyone put aside the matter of \"Li Nan\" and dealt with it later. Subsequently, a series of events occurred, forcing everyone to temporarily shelve the matter of \"Li Nan.\" It wasn't until they returned to the crime scene again that Chen Hui revisited his previous doubts.\n\n\"That lonely spirit back then didn't lie to me. I think the reason the police investigation concluded the victim was named 'Shi Tao' is likely because our investigation at the time missed something. This place probably had two 'victims'.\" Lu Qianxing provided an answer to the previous question.\n\n\"Two victims!\" Hearing Lu Qianxing's answer, Chen Hui was immediately stunned.\n\n\"Yes.\" Lu Qianxing first nodded, then began to explain to Chen Hui. \"At the time, we only found an 'unfinished talisman' at the crime scene. We also thoroughly investigated that talisman, which was a 'Soul Suppressing Talisman.' Besides the 'Soul Suppressing Talisman,' nothing else was found at the crime scene. The 'unfinished joss paper' was found in the open ground not far from the crime scene.\" As Lu Qianxing spoke, he pointed to an open area not far from the crime scene.\n\nHearing this, Chen Hui also looked thoughtful and guessed Lu Qianxing's meaning. \"If I understand correctly, you're saying two cases happened here?\"\n\n\"Currently, these are just my speculations,\" Lu Qianxing said, shrugging. He didn't have absolute certainty about his own conjectures.\n\n\"Although your speculation has a certain possibility, if that's the case, where is the body of the other victim? Could it be, like other missing persons, that they all boarded the 'Bus Route 18'?\" Although Chen Hui didn't deny Lu Qianxing's guess, he still felt in his heart that such a claim was a bit far-fetched and too coincidental.\n\nUpon hearing this, a slightly awkward smile appeared on Lu Qianxing's face. \"I'm having that very thought, but I don't have any evidence to prove it.\" Lu Qianxing's words carried a hint of helplessness.\n\n\"Sigh, at this time, we really should let Ye Bin and the others investigate. If they were here, perhaps they could find some clues.\" Chen Hui felt a headache coming on, feeling he wasn't very suited for investigating cases.\n\nIn the subsequent time, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing investigated the crime scene and the open ground not far from it where the \"half-burned joss paper\" was found. However, as before, they couldn't find any clues.\n\n\"Still no clues found. It seems this matter can only be put aside for now.\" Finally, with no discoveries, the two decided to head to the next suspected location of the \"mysterious woman burning joss paper\" for further investigation.\n\nAt the same time, Old Xu and the other two contacted Lin Xiao and, after obtaining the address of Li Chao's family, they set off to investigate.\n\nWhen Old Xu and the other two arrived at Li Chao's family residence, they met Li Yang's wife, Ma Yan.\n\nFive years after the accident involving Li Chao and his son, Ma Yan remarried in the third year and had since established a new family. Upon hearing the purpose of Old Xu and the other two's visit, Ma Yan actively cooperated with them. According to Ma Yan, she still couldn't believe that the misfortune five years ago had happened to her so suddenly.\n\nWhen Old Xu inquired about Li Chao, Ma Yan immediately burst into tears, repeatedly muttering that she was sorry to her child for not taking good care of him.\n\n\"Sigh, Li Chao was such a good child. When he was little, I, his mother, didn't fulfill my responsibilities. I didn't expect... I didn't expect...\" At this point, Ma Yan choked up and cried like a broken dam.\n\nAfter a while, Ma Yan's emotions stabilized. After offering her apologies, Old Xu again asked Ma Yan about the events of that year.\n\n\"I'm truly sorry. We didn't want to disturb you, but it's for the sake of investigating a case, and we have no choice, so we had to trouble you.\" Old Xu said with an apologetic look. He knew that their visit had brought back painful memories for Ma Yan.\n\n\"I'm fine. Please ask whatever you need to. So many years have passed, and I have a new family. The past can only be considered a nightmare for me,\" Ma Yan said, exhaling deeply.\n\nHearing this, Old Xu nodded and began to inquire, \"It's like this, we want to know the cause of that accident back then.\"\n\n\"It was a car accident. I remember it was winter, and it was snowing heavily that day. The child and his father had dinner and were on their way home. Due to the slippery road caused by the snow, the car overturned, and then...\" At this point, Ma Yan sighed deeply and couldn't continue.\n\n\"Did you see their bodies at the scene of the car accident?\" Zhao Zhen asked. Although he knew his question was inappropriate, for the sake of the investigation, Zhao Zhen had no other choice.\n\n\"The questions you're asking are the same as what a young man who came not long ago asked. He also asked me if I had seen the bodies of my child and husband,\" Ma Yan said, looking at Old Xu and the other two with some confusion.\n\n\"The person before was my colleague. Because he was a bit unreliable in handling matters, so...\" Old Xu said, with an awkward smile on his face.\n\nMa Yan nodded, not thinking much of it, and continued, \"That young man asked the same questions as you, and I told him the same thing. Back then, I saw the bodies of my child and husband. It's just... sigh, that scene is still an unforgettable nightmare in my mind.\"\n\nAlthough Ma Yan didn't explicitly say it, Old Xu and the others had already guessed what kind of tragic scene it was at the car accident site.\n\n\"After that, that young man also asked me some things about my son and husband, and I told him everything. However, judging by his appearance, it didn't seem to help him much,\" Ma Yan recalled her conversation with Fang Chen at the time.\n\n\"However, your colleague is indeed a bit unreliable. In the end, he even asked me if I could confirm whether my child and husband had really died in the car accident.\" Ma Yan said, a hint of anger appearing on her face.\n\n\"...\" Old Xu and the other two fell silent. In fact, they had the same question about what Fang Chen had asked, but they never expected Fang Chen to ask so directly.\n\n\"I'm truly sorry. That child is a bit too blunt in his personality,\" Old Xu said apologetically to Ma Yan with a very awkward expression.\n\n\"You must speak to him properly. Who asks questions like that!\" Ma Yan admonished Old Xu.\n\nOld Xu could only nod with a silly smile, diligently listening to Ma Yan's lecture.\n\nLater, Old Xu and the other two briefly inquired about some other matters concerning Li Chao and his son. From Ma Yan's words, it seemed that Li Chao and his son had indeed died back then, and their ashes were now buried in a cemetery in the suburbs.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 107: Appearing\n\n\"Cough! Cough! Cough!\" With pale cheeks and a gaunt figure, a man in a tattered tracksuit walked slowly in the darkness, one hand covering his chest and the other gripping the wall beside him. Where he walked, sticky drops of blood could occasionally be seen on the ground.\n\n\"It's almost time, daughter. You have to wait for your dad. After a while, your dream can come true.\" The man murmured, a smile full of hope appearing on his pale face.\n\n\"Even if my hands are stained with blood, even if my soul falls into the abyss, as long as I can see your smile again, that's enough.\"\n\nAfter investigating the crime scene in Yingze District, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing found no useful clues. Following Ye Bin's instructions, the two then proceeded to the next crime scene where \"half-burned Joss paper\" was discovered.\n\n\"According to Binzi, it was in this alley that three deceased individuals were found. All three died from alcoholism. However, Binzi said that Ren Zhengyun found an iron bucket at the scene, and inside that bucket, there was 'half-burned Joss paper'.\" Arriving at the scene of the alcoholism case, Chen Hui narrated the details of the case to Lu Qianxing while surveying the area.\n\n\"Is the '18 Bus' bus stop nearby?\"\n\n\"Yes, about two streets away from here, there's a discarded '18 Bus' bus stop,\" Chen Hui nodded, answering Lu Qianxing's question.\n\nLu Qianxing walked to the center of the alley, took out a talisman from his pocket, and then murmured a spell. The next moment, the talisman in his hand suddenly ignited. However, shortly after the talisman began to burn, a gust of cold wind blew, and the talisman in his hand was extinguished.\n\nChen Hui, who had been watching Lu Qianxing's every move from the side, showed a hint of confusion when he saw this. \"Qianxing, how is it? Did you find anything?\"\n\nLu Qianxing frowned slightly and then shook his head. \"I don't know. Theoretically, if the talisman burns completely, a judgment can be made. But now, the talisman burned halfway and was suddenly blown out by a cold wind, which makes it impossible for me to make an accurate judgment.\"\n\n\"If it was blown out, can't you just light another one?\" Chen Hui asked, his voice full of confusion.\n\nLu Qianxing shook his head at Chen Hui's suggestion. \"The talisman I have here was lit by Taoist fire. Generally speaking, ordinary wind cannot blow it out, let alone the wind just now wasn't that strong.\"\n\n\"Is it that magical?\" Chen Hui looked at Lu Qianxing, half-believing and half-doubting. \"Why don't you light another one and try.\"\n\nFacing Chen Hui's skepticism, Lu Qianxing could only smile awkwardly. He then took out another talisman from his pocket, murmured a spell, and the talisman, like before, burned halfway before being blown out by a sudden gust of cold wind.\n\nSeeing the talisman extinguished by the not-so-strong gust of wind, Chen Hui also frowned. \"It really is quite magical.\"\n\n\"I feel like there's something around here. But during the day, that thing probably doesn't dare to come out. Let's wait until night, perhaps we can discover something,\" Lu Qianxing said, looking at Chen Hui.\n\n\"Nighttime, huh,\" Chen Hui murmured, a hint of fear rising in his heart. But finally, Chen Hui let out a long sigh, overcoming his fear. \"Okay, then let's wait until night and come back.\"\n\nDeep into the night, as the lights in the residential buildings one by one extinguished, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui returned to the alley of the crime scene.\n\nCompared to the alley in the morning, the alley was exceptionally quiet, giving off an eerie feeling.\n\n\"Qianxing, do you think there might be something... 'something'?\" Chen Hui stuck close to Lu Qianxing, his eyes constantly darting around, afraid that something might suddenly appear in the alley.\n\nLu Qianxing did not answer Chen Hui's question. Instead, he took out the same talisman from his pocket as during the day and murmured a spell. The next moment, the talisman ignited again. However, this time, the talisman did not burn out halfway. With billowing black smoke drifting, the talisman eventually burned out completely.\n\n\"If the smoke doesn't dissipate, the ghost remains.\" Looking at the black smoke lingering in the air without dispersing, Lu Qianxing frowned and murmured softly.\n\n\"Qianxing, what did you say?\" Chen Hui hadn't heard Lu Qianxing clearly. He only heard Lu Qianxing seem to say the word \"ghost,\" which made Chen Hui's heart feel a chill.\n\n\"There's a ghost,\" Lu Qianxing said coldly, causing Chen Hui to shiver immediately and then feel a gust of cold wind blow past his back.\n\n\"Qianxing, don't joke around at a time like this, you'll scare people to death!\" Chen Hui said, his body trembling uncontrollably.\n\nLu Qianxing looked at Chen Hui, who was clinging to him, and chuckled awkwardly. \"I'm not joking. The talisman I just used is called a 'Ghost-Testing Talisman.' If the smoke dissipates after the talisman burns out, it means there are no ghosts. Now that the smoke has lingered without dissipating, it proves that there is a ghost here.\" Lu Qianxing said, pointing to the black smoke that had been lingering in the air for a long time.\n\n\"...\" Chen Hui swallowed a mouthful of saliva, his eyes slowly moving as he cautiously observed his surroundings. \"Qianqianxing, where... where is the ghost?\"\n\n\"Look, it's standing right beside you, even resting its hand on your shoulder,\" Lu Qianxing said calmly.\n\nUpon hearing Lu Qianxing's words, Chen Hui swallowed several mouthfuls of saliva and stood frozen in place, not daring to move.\n\n\"Qianqianxing, please ask your ghost friend to stop resting on my shoulder. I'm finding it a bit difficult to bear,\" Chen Hui said with a wry smile, his body completely stiffened in place.\n\n\"Haha, I was kidding. He hasn't appeared yet,\" Lu Qianxing said, bursting into laughter at Chen Hui's overly frightened expression.\n\n\"I @#￥@!\" Chen Hui roared in his mind, wishing he could slap Lu Qianxing to death. \"Brother, please don't joke around at a time like this! You'll really scare people to death!\" Chen Hui said, on the verge of tears.\n\nJust as Lu Qianxing was laughing at Chen Hui's timidity, a gust of cold wind suddenly blew, and both of them shivered.\n\nChen Hui stood frozen, feeling as if a hand was indeed resting on his shoulder. \"Qianqianxing, is there something beside me?\" Chen Hui asked tremblingly, not daring to turn his head to look.\n\nLu Qianxing did not answer Chen Hui's question but stared intently at Chen Hui's side.\n\nSeeing Lu Qianxing's gaze fixed on his side, Chen Hui realized that his feeling was not wrong and that there might indeed be something beside him.\n\n\"Your body shows no resentment. Is it that your obsession is too deep, causing you to wander the streets?\" Lu Qianxing said softly, his gaze fixed on Chen Hui's side.\n\n\"I'm waiting for someone.\" Suddenly, right beside Chen Hui's ear, a thin but somewhat gloomy voice suddenly sounded.\n\nThe moment he heard the thin and deep voice, Chen Hui swallowed a mouthful of saliva, his face turning pale, and large drops of cold sweat slowly dripped from his forehead.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 108: Obsession\n\n\"I am waiting for someone.\"\n\n\"Waiting? Waiting for who?\"\n\n\"Waiting for someone who can resolve the obsession in my heart.\"\n\n\"Then have you waited for them?\"\n\n\"I don't know, perhaps, I'll never wait for them.\"\n\nHow deep can an obsession in a person's heart be? One year? Two years? Ten years? Or a hundred years?\n\nActually, an obsession in a person's heart doesn't last long. From the moment one has an obsession until the moment it disappears, it's just a lifetime.\n\nAt the scene of the drunk driving case, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui encountered a lonely spirit who had transformed into a \"ghost\" due to an obsession that was too profound. In a brief exchange with the \"ghost,\" Lu Qianxing could feel that the other party possessed an obsession that they could never let go of.\n\n\"Although I don't know why your obsession is so deep, I hope you can resolve the obsession in your heart, so that I can help you reincarnate.\" From the \"ghost,\" Lu Qianxing only felt a deep \"obsession,\" but no resentment. Similarly, he didn't detect any malevolent energy generated when harming others. Therefore, Lu Qianxing was certain that the other party was not an evil spirit, and he wanted to help them reincarnate.\n\nIn response to Lu Qianxing's goodwill, the \"ghost\" merely shook its head slightly. \"Thank you, the person I'm waiting for hasn't arrived yet, so I'm not going anywhere.\" the \"ghost\" said faintly, a hint of gratitude flashing across its face.\n\n\"But didn't you say that the person you're waiting for might never arrive?\" Lu Qianxing spoke softly, puzzled by what kind of obsession could make the \"ghost\" before him so resolute. Even knowing they wouldn't arrive, they still chose to wait.\n\n\"Qianxing, I felt a profound sadness from him, a very deep sadness.\" Chen Hui couldn't see the \"ghost\" but knew it was standing beside him. During the time the \"ghost\" was communicating with Lu Qianxing, Chen Hui sensed a deep sadness emanating from the \"ghost.\" This sadness infected him, calming Chen Hui, who had initially been frightened, and replaced his fear with sympathy.\n\nLu Qianxing nodded upon hearing this, remaining silent. In fact, while conversing with the \"ghost,\" Lu Qianxing could also feel a profound sadness emanating from the other party, in addition to the obsession.\n\n\"You are here to investigate the case, aren't you? I can help you.\" The \"ghost\" shifted the topic, unwilling to discuss its own affairs further with Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui.\n\n\"You know about the case?\" A flicker of excitement appeared on Chen Hui's face, and he immediately turned to look beside him, though he couldn't see the \"ghost.\"\n\n\"I only saw a person in a black robe appear and take away the souls of those three people.\"\n\n\"The person in the black robe!\" Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui's expressions both sank. This was not the first time they had heard of the \"person in the black robe.\" Previously, in Yingze District, a lonely spirit Lu Qianxing encountered had told him that they had seen a \"person in black.\"\n\n\"Did you get a clear look at the appearance of the person in the black robe?\" Chen Hui asked the \"ghost\" again.\n\n\"That person in the black robe was very terrifying, and I didn't dare to get close to him.\" When mentioning the \"person in the black robe,\" a trace of fear crossed the \"ghost's\" face.\n\n\"Did you see if it was that person in the black robe who killed the three drunkards?\" Chen Hui continued to inquire.\n\nIn response to Chen Hui's question, the \"ghost\" merely shook its head. \"I only saw that the person in the black robe seemed to have sealed the souls of the three drunkards by some method and then took their souls away.\"\n\n\"Soul-sealing talisman.\" After hearing the \"ghost's\" words, Lu Qianxing immediately thought of the incomplete talisman paper found earlier in Yingze District, which was indeed a \"soul-sealing talisman.\"\n\n\"Is it the piece of paper we found in Yingze District?\" Chen Hui had also heard Old Xu mention the \"soul-sealing talisman\" before.\n\nLu Qianxing nodded. \"At the time, in Yingze District, we found a small, incomplete piece of talisman paper. At first, I thought it was a 'ghost-sealing talisman,' but after confirmation, it should be a 'soul-sealing talisman.'\"\n\nJust as Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui focused their attention on the \"soul-sealing talisman,\" the \"ghost\" spoke again. \"One more thing, besides that mysterious person in the black robe, I also saw a woman carrying an iron bucket, burning spirit money late at night.\"\n\nAs soon as the \"ghost\" finished speaking, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui's gazes sharpened.\n\n\"You mean the woman burning spirit money! Where did she appear?\" Although Chen Hui couldn't see the \"ghost,\" he was looking in the \"ghost's\" direction, anxiously asking.\n\n\"At the street corner. It was deep into the night then. She was carrying an iron bucket, squatting at the street corner and burning spirit money. While burning it, she was mumbling something.\"\n\n\"Did you see her appearance?\" Lu Qianxing's voice was also somewhat anxious.\n\nThe \"ghost\" shook its head slightly. \"No, that woman had very frightening resentment energy. I felt like something was attached to her.\" the \"ghost\" recalled.\n\n\"Resentment energy.\" Lu Qianxing murmured, then spoke again. \"Can you determine whether the woman burning spirit money is human or a spirit?\" Lu Qianxing suspected that the \"mysterious woman burning spirit money\" might not be human.\n\n\"Although her resentment energy is heavy, I can also feel the Yang energy from her. I can confirm that she is human.\" The \"ghost\" provided the answer to Lu Qianxing's question.\n\n\"Could it be possession?\" Chen Hui murmured, listening to the exchange between Lu Qianxing and the \"ghost.\"\n\n\"Have you seen a 'Route 18' bus nearby?\" Lu Qianxing didn't continue asking about the \"mysterious woman burning spirit money\" but suddenly thought of the nearby \"Route 18\" bus stop sign.\n\nIn response to Lu Qianxing's inquiry, the \"ghost\" merely shook its head. \"No.\"\n\n\"The 'person in the black robe' and the 'mysterious woman burning spirit money,' do you know where they went?\" After Lu Qianxing's question, Chen Hui posed a new one. Although they had obtained some new clues, these clues did not significantly advance the case. Only by finding the \"person in the black robe\" and the \"mysterious woman burning spirit money\" could there be a substantial breakthrough in the case.\n\n\"I don't know.\" In fact, whether it was the \"person in the black robe\" or the \"mysterious woman burning spirit money,\" after sensing their terrifying nature, the \"ghost\" did not continue to pay attention and wisely chose to leave.\n\n\"Do you have any other findings?\"\n\n\"That's all.\"\n\n\"Thank you for your help.\" Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui spoke in unison, expressing their gratitude.\n\nAlthough the clues provided by the \"ghost\" were not numerous, they were of great help to the case. At the very least, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui could now determine that the \"mysterious woman burning spirit money\" had a direct connection to the case. And the mysterious \"person in the black robe\" was also a key figure in the \"Route 18\" bus case.\n\n\"I am just a lonely ghost. Being able to help you is also accumulating good karma.\" the \"ghost's\" words were very calm.\n\n\"Although I don't know what kind of obsession makes you so persistent, I still hope you can let go of the obsession in your heart, so that I can help you reincarnate. Moreover, you yourself said that the person you're waiting for might never arrive. If you keep waiting, and if you are discovered by the ghost emissaries, you won't even have a chance to reincarnate.\" In the end, Lu Qianxing still wanted to help the other party.\n\n\"After crossing the Bridge of Helplessness and drinking the Forgetfulness Soup, even if I reincarnate, that 'person' won't be me. I appreciate your kindness, but I still want to continue waiting. Even if I eventually dissipate into nothingness, at least I will have no regrets.\"\n\n\"Can a person's obsession really be that deep?\" After bidding farewell to the \"ghost,\" Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui headed to their next investigation location. On the way, Lu Qianxing kept wondering what kind of obsession made the \"ghost\" so persistent.\n\n\"Stop thinking about it!\" Seeing Lu Qianxing lost in thought all the way, Chen Hui patted his shoulder and said with a smile.\n\n\"Do you have an obsession?\" Lu Qianxing ignored Chen Hui's words and looked at him with a confused expression, asking.\n\nBeing asked this by Lu Qianxing, Chen Hui was taken aback. He then recalled something, and after a long while, he slowly said, \"I think everyone has obsessions, don't they?\"\n\n(End of chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 109: Medical Records\n\nTo investigate the clues of Li Chao and his son, Old Xu and his team first visited Li Chao and his son's family. They learned from Li Chao's mother that Li Chao and his son had indeed died in an accident five years ago. However, Old Xu and his team harbored doubts about this outcome. Therefore, they continued their investigation and arrived at the hospital where Li Chao and his son had resided five years prior.\n\nThe hospital where Li Chao and his son lived five years ago was not very large. However, in the intervening five years, the previous hospital had undergone renovations and had become a well-known hospital in the area, with its size also significantly increased.\n\n\"It's been five years. Can we still find anything?\" Ning Hua expressed doubt, looking at the sprawling hospital before them.\n\n\"Don't worry. Generally, hospitals should retain patient medical records for no less than 30 years.\" Old Xu knew more about hospitals than Ning Hua.\n\n\"That long!\" Ning Hua was somewhat surprised to hear this.\n\nAfter the group entered the hospital lobby, all the outpatient service windows were filled with people waiting to register.\n\n\"Why are there so many people in the hospital?\" Ning Hua asked curiously, looking at the crowd in front of the outpatient service windows.\n\n\"There might be the flu going around this time,\" Old Xu guessed.\n\n\"Let's go ask at that window over there first,\" Zhao Zhen pointed to the furthest window among the outpatient service windows. Compared to the others, there were fewer people in front of this one.\n\nAfter queuing for about ten minutes, Old Xu and the other two finally reached the front.\n\nSeated behind the window was a woman in her early thirties, with a stern face and an impatient expression. Upon seeing the three of them, she extended a hand and said coldly, \"Did any of you get bitten?\"\n\n\"Bitten?\" Hearing the woman's question, Old Xu and the other two were stunned and looked confused.\n\n\"What are you staring at? I asked if any of you were bitten by a dog. This is the dog-bite outpatient service window.\" The woman's impatience became even more apparent.\n\n\"Uh, sorry, we weren't bitten by a dog. We're here to inquire about something.\" Ning Hua managed an awkward smile upon seeing the situation.\n\n\"Inquire about something? What are you inquiring about here! If you weren't bitten, move aside. Go queue at the other outpatient services to inquire about things! What are you doing here?\" the woman said coldly, which was rather infuriating.\n\n\"Hey, young lady, how can you speak like that? No matter what, you're in a service industry. How can you be so arrogant!\" Seeing the woman's overbearing demeanor, Zhao Zhen was provoked and spoke up directly, questioning her.\n\n\"Arrogant? How am I arrogant? You've come to the wrong outpatient service. I kindly told you to go next door to ask questions, is that wrong?\" The woman showed disdain and paid no mind to Zhao Zhen's questioning.\n\n\"You!\" Zhao Zhen gritted his teeth, his anger reaching its peak.\n\nSeeing Zhao Zhen's reaction, Old Xu quickly stopped him and then smiled at the woman behind the window, saying, \"I'm truly sorry, we'll leave now.\"\n\n\"Hurry up! Don't block the doorway. People are waiting to be treated behind you. If you delay someone's treatment, can you afford to take responsibility?\"\n\n\"You! You! You!\" Zhao Zhen was so angry that his face turned red. If Old Xu hadn't held him back, Zhao Zhen would have wanted to smash the window with his fist and drag out the arrogant woman inside to teach her a lesson.\n\n\"Tsk!\" A hint of a cold smile flashed across the woman's lips as she looked at Zhao Zhen's reaction.\n\nLater, with Old Xu pulling him along, Zhao Zhen was led away from the window.\n\n\"Old Xu, why did you stop me? Didn't you see how arrogant she was! You can tolerate that?\" Zhao Zhen asked Old Xu through gritted teeth.\n\n\"Old Zhao, don't forget our purpose here is not to argue with people. We still have a case to handle.\"\n\n\"It's not about the case. That woman is too damn arrogant. No, I'm going to find the management here. I want to ask them properly if this is actually a hospital!\" Zhao Zhen said, turning to find the hospital's leadership for a discussion.\n\n\"Old Zhao! I know you're very angry right now, but you have to understand that if we delay solving this case by even a day, one more person will be in danger of death!\" Old Xu said coldly, calling out to Zhao Zhen, who was about to leave.\n\nHearing Old Xu's words, Zhao Zhen gritted his teeth and finally suppressed his anger. \"After this case is solved, I will definitely come back here. I want to see if the employees here are doctors who serve the people, or 'ancestors' of the people who must be revered for everything they do!\"\n\n\"Alright, when the case is solved, I'll go with you,\" Old Xu said with a smile, gently patting Zhao Zhen on the shoulder.\n\n\"Sigh...\" Ning Hua, standing beside them, sighed helplessly at the scene.\n\nAfterward, the three of them queued for a long time at another outpatient service window. This time, they did not encounter the arrogant woman from before but met a very polite young lady.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, but if you want to check medical records, you need to go to the medical records room. However, before that, you need to go to the director's office on the sixth floor to see the director.\" The young lady behind the outpatient service window said with a smile.\n\nSeeing the young lady's demeanor, Zhao Zhen's previous anger completely subsided.\n\n\"Young lady, thank you. Compared to that crazy person over there, your service here makes me feel much more at ease.\" Zhao Zhen said, pointing to the furthest window.\n\n\"Uh.\" The young lady smiled but said nothing.\n\n\"Let's go. We've already wasted a lot of time. Let's hurry to the director's office!\" Finally, at Old Xu's suggestion, the three of them left the outpatient service window and headed for the director's office that the young lady had mentioned.\n\nTaking the elevator, the three reached the sixth floor and quickly found the director's office. However, it was unfortunately locked, and no one was there.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" A passing nurse asked the three of them with some confusion as she saw them standing in front of the director's office.\n\n\"Oh, we want to check a patient's medical records.\"\n\n\"Are you the patient's family? You need the family's identification to check medical records,\" the nurse reminded them.\n\n\"It's like this, we are police officers, and we are investigating a case, so we need to review the patient's medical records.\" Seeing the nurse's wary expression, Old Xu took out his police identification to avoid any unnecessary trouble.\n\n\"Police officers, oh. Then please wait for a moment. The director is currently in a meeting and should be back in about half an hour.\" Hearing that they were police officers, the nurse's wary expression lessened considerably.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Old Xu said with a smile.\n\nAfter the nurse left, Zhao Zhen, standing beside him, asked Old Xu, \"Old Xu, how will we check later? Without proper identification, the director probably won't let us look at the records.\"\n\n\"Don't worry. I anticipated this situation before we came, so I contacted Old Chang in advance. Old Chang will be here shortly.\" Old Xu knew beforehand that related identification was required to check patient medical records, so he had contacted Old Chang in advance.\n\nOld Xu and the other two waited for about forty minutes before the director finally arrived. Before that, Old Chang, having received Old Xu's contact, had already arrived early.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

When the names of Li Chao and his son were mentioned, the director's expression suddenly turned grim, as if he had recalled something.\n\n\"Does the director know this person?\" Seeing the director's expression, Old Xu inquired.\n\n\"Yes, this name rings a bell, but I can't recall who it is at the moment.\" The director felt the name was somewhat familiar but couldn't remember when he had heard it. \"Please wait here for a moment. I'll go to the archives to check.\" Ultimately, the director thought no more of it, turned, and left the office to retrieve the medical records of \"Li Chao and son.\"\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, the director returned in a flustered state, holding a stack of documents.\n\n\"Director? What's wrong?\" Seeing the director's panicked look, Old Xu and the others felt something was amiss.\n\n\"Phew! Phew!\" The director ran into the office, panting, and leaned on the desk for a long time before handing the stack of documents to Old Xu. \"Take a look. Is this the person you're looking for?\"\n\nAfter taking the documents from the director, Old Xu quickly flipped through them, examining them carefully. Upon seeing the photograph on Li Chao's medical record, Old Xu immediately recognized it as Li Chao himself.\n\n\"Li Chao, male, 19 years old. On [Date], due to a car accident, suffered intracranial hemorrhage. Rescue attempts were unsuccessful, deceased; time of death: 23:35:12.\" The file detailed Li Chao's medical records.\n\n\"Li Yang, male, 38 years old. On [Date], due to a car accident, the chest cavity was penetrated by a sharp object through the sternum. Rescue attempts were unsuccessful, deceased; time of death: 00:05:15.\" Old Xu continued to flip through the documents and found the file for Li Chao's father, Li Yang, after Li Chao's record.\n\n\"The time of death for Li Chao and his son were separated by nearly a full day.\" Seeing the files of Li Chao and his son, everyone's hearts were filled with doubt.\n\n\"I knew that name sounded familiar. Five years ago, a strange incident occurred in the hospital, and this father and son were involved.\" As everyone's gaze remained focused on the \"Li Chao and son\" files, the director beside them spoke, still catching his breath.\n\n\"A strange incident!\" Hearing the director's words, Old Xu and the others turned their attention to him.\n\n\"Yes.\" The director nodded first, then took several deep breaths. Once he was no longer panting and had calmed down, the director slowly began to speak.\n\n\"Five years ago, I was just a department head at the hospital, not yet the director. It was almost dawn when I clearly remember two car accident victims being brought into the emergency room. It was my shift. I remember one of the injured had half an arm missing, an iron piece was lodged in his chest, and his face was covered in blood. It was terrifying.\" The director shuddered involuntarily as he spoke.\n\n\"An iron piece in the chest, according to the medical records, that should be Li Chao's father, Li Yang,\" Old Xu murmured.\n\n\"Yes, it seems so. That person was older. However, the other injured person was even more tragic, his face was unrecognizable, a bloody mess, as if disfigured. I only glanced at him then, and to this day, I can't forget that scene.\" The director spoke with a bitter smile, a look of helplessness on his face. Clearly, the scene from that year had become an unforgettable shadow in his life.\n\n\"What happened next?\" Old Xu asked anxiously.\n\n\"I was responsible for treating the older injured person. The disfigured injured person was taken to another emergency room. I remember that after less than half an hour of resuscitation, because the iron piece in the injured person's chest had penetrated the sternum and reached the heart, eventually...\" The director shook his head and sighed at the end.\n\n\"What about the other injured person?\" Old Xu asked again, his anxiety growing more severe.\n\n\"Old Xu, don't rush. Let the director finish,\" Old Chang said, seeing Old Xu's anxious expression. He was also somewhat confused, as he knew Old Xu rarely got this anxious.\n\n\"After the older injured person was confirmed dead and taken to the morgue, the strange things began to happen that night.\" The director said, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead, as if he had recalled something terrifying.\n\n\"After that older injured person was taken to the morgue, several doctors at the hospital claimed to have seen a figure in the morgue that night. At the time, no one paid much attention to it, as rumors of the hospital morgue being haunted are generally false.\" The director showed a slightly embarrassed smile.\n\nUpon hearing this, the others did not speak, merely nodding. The hospital morgue was a place for storing bodies, and such a place would naturally evoke endless imagination.\n\n\"Then, that night, in the other emergency room, after a full day of resuscitation, they couldn't save the child's life either.\" The director shook his head and sighed, feeling a sense of melancholy.\n\n\"When that child was confirmed dead, we took the child's body to the morgue as well. And it was that night, after the child's body was taken to the morgue, that the last doctor to leave the morgue said he saw a little girl in a dress smiling at him.\" The director finished speaking, crossed his arms, and shivered violently.\n\nUpon hearing the director's words, Old Xu and the other two froze in place, their faces filled with astonishment.\n\n\"Old Xu, what's wrong with you guys?\" Seeing the looks on their faces, Old Chang couldn't help but shiver and then patted Old Xu's shoulder to ask.\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing, nothing.\" Old Xu snapped back to attention, quickly shaking his head, and then gave an awkward smile. \"Director, what happened next? Was there any follow-up?\" Old Xu said, looking at the director.\n\n\"After that, the doctor went mad. Sigh...\" The director sighed again.\n\n\"What about those two bodies?\"\n\n\"On the morning of the third day, the families of the two deceased came. After completing the procedures, they took the bodies to the crematorium.\"\n\n\"Do you know which crematorium?\" As soon as the director finished speaking, Ning Hua beside him blurted out the question.\n\n\"Uh, there should only be one crematorium in this area. I just don't know if that crematorium is still open, considering five years have passed.\"\n\n\"Director, could you take us to that morgue?\" Old Xu didn't ask about the crematorium first.\n\n\"The morgue...\" Hearing Old Xu's words, the director frowned.\n\n\"What's wrong? Is it not possible?\"\n\n\"It's not that it's impossible, but after that incident, the morgue was sealed up and later converted into a disused warehouse. Even if you go now, you probably won't find anything.\"\n\n\"Director, this case is of great importance. Regardless of whether we find anything, we must investigate.\"\n\nSeeing Old Xu's resolute attitude, the director helplessly shook his head. \"Sigh, it's not that I don't want you to investigate, but that morgue is too ominous. Anyone who enters it will bring bad luck.\" A friend of the director had entered that morgue and subsequently encountered misfortune, and even consulting many \"fortune tellers\" proved useless.\n\n\"Director, please.\" Old Xu and his group were very determined and showed no hesitation despite the director's words.\n\n\"Fine. You police officers are sometimes truly incomprehensible. I'll get you the key, but I won't go in. You go in yourselves. If you encounter anything unclean, don't blame me for not warning you.\" The director shook his head and said.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 111: The Morgue\n\n“The morgue is just ahead,” the dean said, leading Old Xu and his group through a patch of weeds to a dilapidated lime building.\n\nOutside the lime building, various sundries were piled high, and even the building's door was completely obscured by them.\n\n“It looks like this place has been abandoned for a long time,” Old Xu said slowly, looking at the weeds and various rusty objects around the building.\n\n“After that strange incident, it was as if this place was cursed. Everyone who entered the building contracted bad luck, and from then on, it became a forbidden area of the hospital. Most people in the hospital have heard the rumors about this place. At first, some people came out of curiosity, but after these people encountered bad luck, the rumor of the curse spread like wildfire. In the end, no one was curious about this place anymore,” the dean said, shaking his head as he looked at the lime building.\n\n“Since this place is so creepy, why didn’t you tear it down and just leave it here?” Old Chang asked, looking at the dean with confusion.\n\n“Tear it down? We did think about tearing it down. Back then, we hired a bulldozer, and just as we were about to push the house down, guess what happened?” the dean said, drawing out the suspense.\n\n“What?” Everyone’s curiosity was piqued, and their gazes turned to the dean.\n\n“Even now, I find it incredible. The bulldozer, which was working perfectly fine, suddenly broke down and wouldn’t move. Three or four repairmen came, and they checked it all afternoon, but they couldn’t figure out why the bulldozer had suddenly broken down,” the dean recalled.\n\n“Broke down?” Old Xu and the others showed a hint of surprise on their faces.\n\n“Yes, it just broke down so bizarrely. But I’m telling you, that’s not all. The most peculiar thing was that after we towed the bulldozer out with a truck, it immediately started working again. At first, no one thought much of it. Seeing that the bulldozer was working, they drove it back in. As soon as they drove it in, the bulldozer broke down again,” the dean said, finding the whole incident incredibly strange every time he recalled it.\n\n“So, did you tow the vehicle away again?”\n\n“After going back and forth three or four times, I remember someone saying that this house could not be torn down, and that something bad would happen if it was. From then on, we locked this place up and stopped paying attention to it.”\n\n“This house is so strange, Old Xu. I don’t think we should go in rashly. Let’s contact that child Qianxing and see what he says.” After hearing the dean’s words, Zhao Zhen felt they should consult Lu Qianxing.\n\nOld Xu agreed with Zhao Zhen’s suggestion. “Mm.”\n\nThen, Old Xu called Lu Qianxing and explained the current situation in detail. After listening to Old Xu’s account, Lu Qianxing instructed Old Xu not to enter the lime building rashly.\n\n“How is it? What did Qianxing say?” Zhao Zhen asked anxiously as soon as Old Xu hung up the phone.\n\n“Qianxing said that he and Chen Hui are on their way, and asked us not to enter the lime building rashly,” Old Xu said, then turned to Old Chang. “Old Chang, you should go back first. I’ll handle the rest of the investigation myself.” Old Xu didn’t want Old Chang to be too involved in the case.\n\n“I’m fine.”\n\n“Old Chang, listen to Old Xu and go back. If there’s anything, we’ll contact you anytime,” Zhao Zhen also said, persuading Old Chang to leave.\n\n“At a time like this, how can I leave?” Although Old Chang knew that Old Xu and Zhao Zhen were looking out for him, he felt that since he had already come, there was no reason to retreat even if it was dangerous.\n\nSeeing this, Old Xu walked forward, gently patted Old Chang’s shoulder, and then said slowly, “Old Chang, listen to my advice. I’ll handle this case. You have other things to do, so go back.”\n\n“Old Xu…”\n\n“Old Chang!” Old Xu said sternly, interrupting Old Chang, who was about to speak. “Do you remember what I asked you to do earlier?”\n\n“I remember,” Old Chang nodded.\n\n“Since you remember, then go back and do what you need to do. I’ll handle this case,” Old Xu said calmly, then patted Old Chang’s shoulder again.\n\n“Old Xu…” Old Chang looked at Old Xu, wanting to say something, but in the end, he chose to remain silent, nodded, and left with the dean without another word.\n\nAbout an hour later, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui rushed over, sweat still visible on their foreheads.\n\n“Is this the morgue?” Lu Qianxing asked, panting heavily, as he looked at the lime building ahead.\n\n“Don’t rush, take a moment to catch your breath,” Old Xu said caringly, seeing them out of breath.\n\n“It’s fine.” Lu Qianxing waved his hand, took a deep breath, and then recovered. “You haven’t gone inside, have you?” he asked, looking at the three of them after he had caught his breath.\n\nOld Xu and the other two shook their heads. Then, Old Xu handed the key given by the dean to Lu Qianxing. “Here’s the key. We haven’t gone in yet.”\n\n“Good, that’s good,” Lu Qianxing said, taking the key. His gaze then scanned the area around the lime building carefully.\n\nAfter about five minutes, Lu Qianxing asked everyone to move the piled-up sundries away from the lime building’s door.\n\nOnce the sundries were moved, they saw a rusty lock. Lu Qianxing took out the key, inserted it into the lock, and with a gentle turn, opened it.\n\n“It seems the lock isn’t completely rusted,” Lu Qianxing said as he slowly pushed the iron door.\n\n“Creak!” A piercing sound echoed as Lu Qianxing slowly pushed the iron door open. As soon as Lu Qianxing opened a crack in the door, a pungent, foul odor assailed their nostrils.\n\n“Why does it smell so bad? Is there a decaying corpse inside?” Chen Hui asked, pinching his nose.\n\n“This smell doesn’t seem like the stench of a corpse,” Old Xu also said, pinching his nose.\n\nAs he smelled the foul odor, Lu Qianxing also pinched his nose with one hand while continuing to push the iron door with the other.\n\n“Creak!” The piercing sound echoed again. When the iron door was more than halfway open, everyone could see several white-sheet-covered beds placed inside the morgue.\n\n“Didn’t they say it was converted into a warehouse? Why does it still look like a morgue inside?” Ning Hua asked, confused. According to what the dean had said earlier, the morgue had been converted into a warehouse, but judging by the current appearance, it didn’t seem to be the case, as everything in the morgue remained unchanged.\n\nLu Qianxing pushed the iron door open completely but did not enter. Instead, his gaze meticulously swept across the morgue.\n\n“There’s a lingering resentment here,” Lu Qianxing said, frowning after scanning the morgue.\n\n“Resentment? Could it be… a ghost?” Chen Hui didn’t say the word “ghost” but his expression made it clear to everyone what he was implying.\n\nLu Qianxing shook his head. “There’s only a lingering resentment. I haven’t detected anything else.” As Lu Qianxing spoke, he took a piece of paper from his pocket and stood at the entrance of the morgue, muttering to himself. In the next instant, the paper caught fire, emitting thick black smoke. However, not long after the paper was lit, a gust of cold wind suddenly blew, extinguishing the flame.\n\n“Why did it go out again!” Seeing the paper extinguish as soon as it was lit, Chen Hui felt a chilling sensation crawl up his spine.\n\n“What does it mean that it went out?” Old Xu and the other two looked at Chen Hui in confusion.\n\n“There’s a ghost,” Chen Hui’s reply caused Old Xu and the other two to shiver, and cold sweat broke out on their foreheads.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 112: The Little Girl\n\n\"There's a ghost!\"\n\nChen Hui's answer made the faces of Old Xu and the other two sink to the extreme. At the same time, everyone felt a cold, eerie wind blowing from behind them.\n\n\"Don't be nervous, the talisman I just lit isn't a ghost-detecting talisman.\" Seeing everyone's panicked expressions, Lu Qianxing gave an awkward smile.\n\n\"No ghost!\" Everyone's eyes widened as they stared at Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"There's only residual resentment here, no 'ghost' exists.\" Being stared at by everyone, Lu Qianxing felt uncomfortable all over. He scratched his head and spoke awkwardly.\n\nAfter Lu Qianxing's confirmation, Old Xu and the other two's gazes instantly shifted, and they all glared at Chen Hui ferociously.\n\n\"No, well, I I don't know if it wasn't.\" Chen Hui said with a wry smile.\n\n\"Alas, you kid, don't be so jumpy. The ghosts didn't scare me to death, but you scared me half to death.\" Old Xu gave Chen Hui a sideways glance, then heaved a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Yeah, Chen Hui, scaring people scares people to death!\" Being startled by Chen Hui like this, Ning Hua also felt a chill run down his spine.\n\nAfter confirming there were no ghosts, everyone also heaved a sigh of relief, and the fear on their faces dissipated.\n\n\"Qianxing, what was the talisman you just lit for?\" After calming down, Old Xu asked Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"It's a resentment-dissipating talisman, a type of talisman used to resolve resentment. When the talisman burns out, the resentment can be successfully resolved. The talisman just now only burned halfway, which means the resentment in this place has not been resolved,\" Lu Qianxing explained to Old Xu in detail.\n\n\"Then what will happen if the resentment here is not resolved?\" Ning Hua asked.\n\n\"You said before that this place would bring bad luck, and the reason for bringing bad luck is that the resentment here is too heavy. When resentment attaches itself to a person, it brings bad luck to the person who is attached to the resentment.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Ning Hua nodded, then spoke again, asking another question, \"Then where does the resentment here come from?\"\n\n\"Could it be because this is a morgue? Because the yin energy is too heavy, it became resentment?\" Chen Hui guessed.\n\nLu Qianxing shook his head in response, \"Generally speaking, too much yin energy can indeed transform into resentment, but this morgue has been abandoned for five years. Even the strongest resentment cannot last for such a long time. Moreover, if it were just ordinary resentment, the resentment-dissipating talisman could solve it.\" Lu Qianxing directly denied Chen Hui's idea.\n\n\"If that's the case, then where does this resentment come from? From Li Chao and his son?\" Old Xu murmured, guessing in his heart.\n\n\"They just died in a car accident, will that accumulate so much resentment?\" Zhao Zhen rested his chin on his hand, also guessing.\n\n\"If the resentment doesn't come from Li Chao and his son, then...\" Ning Hua said, recalling the dean's words.\n\nJust as Old Xu and the other two were deep in thought, suddenly, the gazes of Old Xu and the other two converged on Lu Qianxing in an instant.\n\nSeeing the way Old Xu and the other two looked, Lu Qianxing was instantly stunned. Being stared at by the three of them made him feel uncomfortable all over. \"Uh? What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Qianxing, back in Black Water Village, the little girl lying in the bronze coffin was wearing a black dress.\" Old Xu was the first to speak.\n\n\"If our guess is correct, could the resentment here have some connection with the little girl in the bronze coffin?\" Old Zhao added.\n\n\"Perhaps Li Chao and his son's deaths are related to that little girl,\" Ning Hua was the last to speak his guess.\n\nHearing what Old Xu and the other two said, Lu Qianxing also frowned.\n\n\"Qianxing, can you find out where the resentment comes from?\"\n\n\"With my cultivation, I don't know if I can, but I can try.\" Although there was a method, because Lu Qianxing's cultivation was limited, he himself didn't know if he could find out where the resentment came from.\n\n\"Let's try. If we can find out, maybe we can find some clues.\"\n\n\"I can try, but don't have too much hope.\" Lu Qianxing had a wry smile on his face. The higher the hope, the greater the disappointment. He was afraid that everyone would have too high expectations of him, and if he failed, it would be unacceptable to everyone.\n\n\"Do your best,\" Old Xu said with a smile, not wanting to put too much pressure on Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"Okay.\" Lu Qianxing nodded, then took out a rusty compass from his pocket. \"No matter what you see later, don't make a sound and stay calm.\" Lu Qianxing instructed Old Xu and the others, then held the compass with one hand, placed the index finger of the other hand in his mouth, bit it lightly, and a drop of blood oozed out. Then, Lu Qianxing dripped the blood from his fingertip onto the compass.\n\nLu Qianxing muttered an incantation, and then the pointer of the compass began to spin rapidly. While the compass was spinning rapidly, Lu Qianxing took out another talisman from his pocket with his right hand, flicked his hand casually, and the talisman ignited. Rolling black smoke converged above the compass.\n\nWhen the talisman burned out, a thick layer of black smoke filled the compass. \"Break!\" Lu Qianxing held the compass in his left hand and shouted loudly. Then, he extended his left hand and threw the compass into the center of the swirling black smoke.\n\nThe moment the compass passed through the black smoke, the black smoke dissipated, and then the smell of smoke filled the entire morgue.\n\nEveryone present, including Lu Qianxing, inhaled some of the smoky smell. The moment they inhaled the smoky smell, everyone felt a little dizzy, and then, before their eyes, a little girl seemed to appear indistinctly.\n\nThe little girl was wearing a black dress and holding a doll in her arms. At this moment, she seemed to be smiling at everyone.\n\nSeeing this scene, everyone's faces were filled with fear, but remembering Lu Qianxing's instructions, everyone suppressed their fear and gritted their teeth tightly.\n\n\"Hehe...\" The figure of the little girl became clearer and clearer before everyone's eyes. With a hair-raising laugh, everyone saw that the little girl holding the doll suddenly stretched out a hand and slowly waved at them.\n\nWith a tender face and pale complexion, everyone felt an unprecedented and terrifying resentment from the little girl before them.\n\n\"Do you want to play with me?\" The little girl tilted her head, her big, watery eyes fixed on everyone. Her originally cute appearance now made everyone involuntarily shiver.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Lu Qianxing gritted his teeth and spoke, cold sweat dripping from his forehead.\n\n\"If you play with me, I'll tell you.\" The little girl still had a playful and cute appearance, but in Lu Qianxing and the others' eyes, that playful and cute appearance hid a terrifying and chilling aura.\n\nLu Qianxing ignored the little girl's words, just gritted his teeth and said coldly, \"Who are you!\"\n\nSeeing that Lu Qianxing ignored her, the little girl's face suddenly sank. \"None of you want to play with me? Since you don't want to play with me, then I...\" Before the little girl could finish her words, her face became ferocious.\n\nThe moment Lu Qianxing saw the little girl's ferocious face, he quickly shouted, \"Bite your hand!\"\n\nAs soon as Lu Qianxing finished speaking, he raised his right hand to his mouth and bit his palm fiercely.\n\nSeeing this, Old Xu and the others had no time to hesitate. Like Lu Qianxing, they raised their right hands to their mouths and bit down fiercely.\n\nAs the sharp pain appeared, the cute yet terrifying little girl before them disappeared, leaving only the empty morgue.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 113: Do Your Best\n\nWhen everything subsided, the palms of Lu Qianxing and his group were left with a row of teeth marks, oozing a little blood.\n\n\"Qianxing, are you okay?\" Seeing Lu Qianxing stumble backward a few steps, Old Xu quickly stepped forward to support him.\n\nAt this moment, Lu Qianxing's face was pale, his lips were purple, and his whole person looked very weak.\n\n\"I'm fine, just a little too exhausted. How about everyone else? Is everyone okay?\" Lu Qianxing said, looking at the others.\n\n\"My hands just hurt a little, but other than that, nothing else.\" Chen Hui only felt a dull ache in his hands.\n\n\"Yes, we're the same. Our hands just hurt a little. We're fine,\" Zhao Zhen and Ning Hua also nodded.\n\n\"That's good.\" Seeing that everyone was fine, Lu Qianxing breathed a sigh of relief. \"Uncle Xu, let's go out first to avoid any further trouble.\"\n\nNo one had any objections to Lu Qianxing's suggestion. Afterward, with the support of Old Xu and Chen Hui, the group left the morgue.\n\n\"Qianxing, should we lock this door?\" Zhao Zhen asked Lu Qianxing, holding the lock after closing the morgue's iron door.\n\n\"Lock it,\" Lu Qianxing said weakly.\n\n\"I say, Qianxing, are you really okay? You don't look too good.\" Chen Hui felt that Lu Qianxing's hands were cold and was a little worried.\n\n\"I'm really fine, just a bit weak,\" Lu Qianxing forced a smile.\n\n\"This time it's my fault. Qianxing, don't push yourself too hard in the future. Just do your best.\" Old Xu felt a trace of guilt. If it weren't for his suggestion to have Lu Qianxing investigate the source of the resentment, Lu Qianxing wouldn't have ended up like this.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, you were just trying to investigate the case, so you can't blame yourself. Moreover, this method was not dangerous at all. It's just that the resentment was too great, and my cultivation was insufficient, which is why...\" Lu Qianxing sighed at the end.\n\n\"Qianxing, who exactly was that little girl just now? Why was she exactly the same as the girl in the bronze coffin?\" Seeing that everyone was fine, Ning Hua spoke up, asking about the little girl from earlier.\n\nLu Qianxing actually had the same question. \"I'm not very sure either.\"\n\n\"Qianxing, did the resentment originate from that little girl?\" Old Xu, who was supporting Lu Qianxing, also asked.\n\n\"You could say yes, or you could say no.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Hearing Lu Qianxing's answer, confusion flickered across everyone's faces.\n\n\"The resentment did originate from the little girl we saw, but I believe that to gather such terrifying resentment, she must have died with terrible grievances in life. However, based on the clues and speculations we have so far, if the little girl here is the same person as the girl in the bronze coffin, then her resentment shouldn't be this heavy.\" According to the previous speculation by Lu Qianxing and others, the girl in the bronze coffin and the girl who died in an accident were the same person, and the girl who died in an accident should not have such terrifying resentment.\n\nAfter hearing Lu Qianxing's words, everyone else also frowned and pondered.\n\n\"Qianxing, I remember you mentioned something about 'borrowing a corpse to return a soul' before. Could the heavy resentment on that little girl be related to 'borrowing a corpse to return a soul'?\" Chen Hui recalled what Lu Qianxing had said about 'borrowing a corpse to return a soul' before.\n\n\"'Borrowing a corpse to return a soul' is just about the soul of a deceased person using the body of someone who just died to be resurrected. It has nothing to do with resentment,\" Lu Qianxing explained to Chen Hui, negating Chen Hui's idea.\n\n\"Qianxing, besides the resentment, did you find anything else?\" Old Xu and the others couldn't investigate everything related to the morgue, so they could only leave the investigation to Lu Qianxing.\n\nTo Old Xu's question, Lu Qianxing shook his head. \"No.\"\n\n\"If there are no clues, we can only move on to the next location,\" Zhao Zhen said, looking at Old Xu.\n\nOld Xu nodded first, then asked Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui, \"Qianxing, Chen Hui, I haven't had a chance to ask yet, but have you found any clues on your end?\" Since they hadn't found any clues, Old Xu placed his hopes on Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui.\n\n\"We investigated two crime scenes where the 'mysterious woman burning joss paper' was suspected to have appeared. At both crime scenes, we found some commonalities. Firstly, at the crime scenes, we found 'joss paper that was only half-burned' and a mysterious 'figure in black robes.' In addition, in the case in Yingze District, we suspect there were two victims, one was 'Shi Tao,' whose body was found, and the other was 'Li Nan,' who went missing. We also encountered a 'ghost' at the scene of the drunken assault case. According to the 'ghost,' the 'mysterious woman burning joss paper' is an ordinary person, but she carries a deep 'resentment.'\" Chen Hui described their findings in detail to Old Xu and the other two.\n\n\"It seems you've made quite a bit of progress,\" Old Xu sighed after listening to Chen Hui's narration.\n\n\"What do you mean by 'figure in black robes' and 'ghost'?\" Zhao Zhen was more sensitive to the matters concerning the 'figure in black robes' and the 'ghost' in Chen Hui's description.\n\n\"Regarding this 'figure in black robes,' I do have some impression. Qianxing also mentioned before that the lonely soul you asked about told you that a 'man in black' had appeared at the crime scene,\" Old Xu said, looking at Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"He appeared at two crime scenes. Could this man in black be the murderer?\" Ning Hua also speculated.\n\n\"It's not impossible, but we haven't figured out the identities of the 'figure in black robes' and the 'mysterious woman burning joss paper.' Without any concrete evidence, we can't make a judgment yet.\" Chen Hui had also considered Ning Hua's speculation, but without any concrete evidence, such speculation was merely a deduction.\n\n\"Why do I feel like we're getting further and further away from the truth?\" Zhao Zhen sighed. Although many clues had been found so far, there was no definitive clue that could bring them closer to the truth.\n\n\"This case is different from previous ones. However, I believe that as long as we continue to investigate, we will find useful clues, and then we can bring the real culprit to justice.\" Old Xu remained convinced that as long as they kept investigating, the case would eventually be solved.\n\n\"That may be true, but how much time do we have left?\" Chen Hui shook his head and sighed. Facing the public's questioning, there was not much time left for them to investigate.\n\n\"Let's do our best. At least it's not like we found nothing,\" Old Xu persuaded everyone.\n\nUpon hearing Old Xu's words, no one else said anything, they just nodded.\n\nAfterward, Old Xu and his group left. However, since Lu Qianxing could not resolve the resentment in the morgue, he had to find the hospital director, give him several talismans, and instruct the director to seal off the morgue and not allow anyone to enter under any circumstances.\n\nFor this reason, the director found people to erect an iron fence around the morgue and put up a notice, completely sealing off the morgue.\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Lu Qianxing and the other person parted ways with Old Xu and his group again. Lu Qianxing and the other person went to the third location where the \"mysterious woman burning joss paper\" was suspected to have appeared, based on the video circulating online. Old Xu and his group, informed by the director, went to the nearest crematorium to continue investigating the clues about \"Li Chao and his son.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

Any results from the investigation?\"\n\n\"I've investigated all the victims from all the cases, and I haven't found anyone whose situation is the same as Li Chao and his son.\"\n\n\"Mm, anything else you've discovered?\"\n\n\"Brother Lin, do you remember the accident from five years ago?\"\n\n\"I remember. What about it?\"\n\n\"Among the five deceased in that accident from five years ago, besides that little girl Zhou Yi, I've identified the identity of another deceased.\"\n\nUpon hearing Fang Chen's words, Lin Xiao's gaze instantly sharpened. \"Who?\"\n\n\"Li Yang.\"\n\n\"Li Yang!?\" Hearing this name, a flicker of surprise crossed Lin Xiao's face. \"Where did you find that out?\"\n\n\"I found Li Yang's former lover. From Li Yang's former lover, I learned something. His former lover told me that Li Yang had lied to his wife, saying he was going on a business trip, but in reality, Li Yang was meeting her in secret. While Li Yang was with his former lover, one day, Li Yang received a call from a stranger. After finishing the call, Li Yang left alone. From then on, Li Yang's former lover could no longer contact him. For this reason, Li Yang's former lover even sneaked near Li Yang's home to find him, but she said that when she quietly approached Li Yang, he seemed not to recognize her. About a week later, the news reported that Li Chao and his son had an accident.\"\n\nAfter listening to Fang Chen's narration, Lin Xiao fell into thought. After a long pause, he slowly spoke, \"How did you determine that Li Yang was connected to the accident from five years ago?\"\n\n\"The time Li Yang left his former lover's place perfectly matches the time of the accident five years ago.\"\n\n\"Anything else?\" Lin Xiao asked Fang Chen calmly. If it were just a guess, Lin Xiao didn't think Fang Chen would have told him so definitively that one of the deceased in the accident five years ago was Li Yang.\n\n\"Li Yang's former lover heard Li Yang's phone conversation with the stranger. The person on the phone asked Li Yang to go to 'Blackwater Village.' The time and place all match. I think if this is a coincidence, it's too much of a coincidence.\" Fang Chen didn't believe all of this was just a coincidence.\n\n\"What about Li Chao? Have you found any clues about Li Chao?\" Lin Xiao didn't continue asking about Li Yang but shifted his focus to Li Chao.\n\n\"I found the school Li Chao attended. After the investigation, I discovered that Li Chao was a very unremarkable person. Neither his teachers nor his classmates had a strong impression of him. Moreover, Li Chao had no friends, and no one knows what kind of person Li Chao really was.\" During this period, Fang Chen's investigation into Li Chao and his son was very thorough.\n\n\"Okay, I got it. Continue your investigation and see if you can find anything about Li Chao.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nAfter hanging up Fang Chen's call, Lin Xiao fell into thought, replaying the clues Fang Chen had found in his mind.\n\nAs Lin Xiao was contemplating, a police officer in his early forties knocked and entered Lin Xiao's office.\n\n\"Captain Lin, we can go.\"\n\n\"Mm, let's go.\" Seeing the police officer in his early forties, Lin Xiao nodded and got up to leave the office with him.\n\nIn order to solve the case, Lin Xiao visited the crime scenes of various cases multiple times every day during this period. Although he hadn't found any key clues, Lin Xiao remained persistent, investigating the crime scenes over and over again.\n\n\"Captain Lin, where are we going to investigate today?\" the police officer in his early forties asked respectfully. For these past few days, it had been himself accompanying Lin Xiao in the investigation.\n\n\"Yunxiang High School.\" Lin Xiao said calmly.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nDue to the successive occurrence of cases, although Lin Xiao had not slacked off on the Yunxiang High School case, he was still overwhelmed during this period.\n\n\"By the way, what's your name?\" During the investigations of the past few days, Lin Xiao had been so focused on the cases that he hadn't had any leisure time to think about other matters, so he didn't even know the name of the police officer in his early forties beside him.\n\nAs he was driving, the police officer in his early forties heard Lin Xiao ask him and a slightly excited smile appeared on his face. \"Captain Lin, my name is Shen Hua.\"\n\n\"Shen Hua.\" Lin Xiao murmured, nodded, and didn't say anything further.\n\nShen Hua drove, and Lin Xiao sat in the passenger seat, diligently reviewing a stack of documents. After about an hour, they arrived at the crime scene of the Yunxiang High School case, a derelict house.\n\nAfter getting out of the car, Shen Hua followed Lin Xiao into the house. However, as soon as they entered, Shen Hua frowned. Even though many days had passed, there was still a pungent, foul odor in the house.\n\n\"Why is there so much blood everywhere? What happened!\" Seeing bloodstains all over the house, Shen Hua's face was filled with surprise.\n\nLin Xiao ignored Shen Hua and moved around the room, carefully examining it.\n\n\"Captain Lin, what exactly happened here!\" Seeing the tragic scene in the house, Shen Hua was very curious about what had happened in the first place.\n\nThe police had only announced to the public that the bodies of four students were found in a derelict house in the Yunxiang High School case, without disclosing any details about the crime scene.\n\n\"Just as you see, when we arrived at the crime scene, the bodies of the four deceased had been torn apart by something unknown.\" Lin Xiao did not hide the situation in the house from Shen Hua, but at the same time, he did not describe the situation in great detail, only passing over it with a simple sentence.\n\n\"Torn apart by something unknown!\" Although it was just a simple sentence, a terrifying image played out in Shen Hua's mind: the bodies of four students torn apart, blood splattering and staining the entire house.\n\n\"Captain Lin, there are rumors outside that the recent cases were committed by a fierce ghost. Is it true?\" Shen Hua thought of the outside rumors and, combined with what he saw, a thought occurred to him.\n\nHearing Shen Hua's words, Lin Xiao turned, looked at Shen Hua calmly, and then said coldly, \"Do you believe in ghosts?\"\n\n\"Ah.\" Lin Xiao's question stunned Shen Hua for a moment, but he immediately shook his head, \"No, I don't believe in them.\"\n\n\"Then what if I told you that the recent cases were indeed committed by a fierce ghost.\" Lin Xiao said with a calm, cold expression.\n\n\"Ah!\" Hearing this, Shen Hua froze in place, his face full of shock.\n\n\"Without any evidence, any judgment is useless. If you want to know if it's a fierce ghost, investigate properly.\" Lin Xiao finished speaking, turned, and continued to investigate the crime scene, ignoring Shen Hua.\n\nShen Hua stood frozen, looking at the diligently investigating Lin Xiao, sighed, shook his head slightly, and then, like Lin Xiao, began to carefully investigate the crime scene.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 115: Identity\n\nOn a winter night, heavy snow fell, blanketing the entire city. On the frigid streets, everyone, bundled in thick cotton-padded jackets, hurried towards \"home\" as quickly as possible.\n\n\"It's so cold! The weather this year is truly exaggeratedly cold!\"\n\n\"Who says it isn't? I heard the lowest temperature today is expected to break minus 40 degrees Celsius.\"\n\n\"Minus 40 degrees? Seriously!\"\n\n\"Look! My phone is even frozen and won't turn on!\"\n\n\"No way! Really! It's minus 38 degrees now! A new record.\"\n\nSeveral employees who had just finished work, though layered in multiple cotton coats, still felt a bone-chilling cold.\n\n\"I can't take it anymore! I'm going to take a taxi back. Are you guys coming? If so, let's go together.\"\n\n\"Let's go, let's go! Together, together. In this terrible weather, if we stay any longer, I think we'll turn into ice sculptures.\" Several employees hailed a taxi by the roadside and all piled into the car.\n\nWith temperatures at minus 38 degrees Celsius and heavy snow falling, no one was willing to stay outdoors in such cold weather. Everyone wanted to return home immediately, burrow under their blankets, and have a good sleep.\n\nAs the night deepened, the usually bustling streets became deserted. Under the faint light at a bus stop, a girl stood, wearing a thick down jacket.\n\n\"Little girl, are you going somewhere? It's so late, the bus is long gone.\" A passing taxi stopped at the bus stop. The driver rolled down the window and called out to the girl standing there.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not going anywhere! I'm waiting for someone. The person picking me up will be here soon,\" the girl replied with a smile.\n\n\"Alright then, little girl. It's late at night, and there isn't even a shadow of a person around. Be careful,\" the driver said with concern. After speaking, he rolled up the window and drove away.\n\n\"Thank you.\" The girl offered a grateful smile. However, after the taxi had driven away, two streams of tears silently fell from her eyes.\n\nIn reality, the girl standing at the bus stop wasn't waiting for anyone. She had been working as a customer service representative at a company, but was fired due to a complaint from a deliberately troublesome customer. After being dismissed, the girl had nowhere to go. Her money was almost depleted, and she couldn't even afford accommodation, forcing her to wander the streets.\n\nIn the freezing temperature, despite being dressed in a thick down jacket, the girl couldn't ward off the biting wind. She struggled to walk through the snow. After a short while, she felt her head swimming. A little further on, she collapsed into a snowdrift.\n\nThe next day, as the sun rose, the girl felt no trace of cold on her body. In a daze, she opened her eyes and found herself lying in a room. On a table beside her, there was a cup of steaming hot water.\n\n\"You're awake.\" A gruff voice, tinged with a bit of weariness, sounded. The girl was startled for a moment, then turned her head to the side.\n\nThere sat a man with a face etched with years of hardship. He was wearing a black tracksuit and was sitting on a stool by her bed, staring at her blankly.\n\n\"You! Who are you!\" the girl asked, looking at the man with panic and a face full of vigilance.\n\n\"You collapsed in the snow last night and still have a fever. There's medicine on the table. Take it when you get up. There are dishes I just heated up in the kitchen. If you're hungry, go eat,\" the man said in a deep voice. After speaking, he stood up and left the girl's room.\n\n\"I...\" The girl tried to say something, but the man had already left. With the sound of a heavy door closing, the girl managed to get out of bed. Once she confirmed she hadn't been harmed in any way, she let out a sigh of relief.\n\nThe girl first drank the medicine on the table, then walked out of the room. She immediately saw the dishes on the kitchen table, as the man had said they were already heated.\n\nHaving not eaten a proper meal for many days, the girl bit her lip as she looked at the dishes on the table. Finally, she sat down at the table and cleared her plate. After eating, she tidied up the dishes and then curiously explored the house she was in.\n\nThe house wasn't large. It had two bedrooms. One was the bedroom she had slept in last night, and the other seemed to be the man's. The man's bedroom was locked, and the girl couldn't open it.\n\nBesides that, there was a kitchen and a small living room. The entire house was meticulously organized, not a speck of mess.\n\nOn the coffee table in the living room, the girl found a family photo. In the picture, she saw the man from before, along with a young woman and a little girl. The girl guessed that the other two must be the man's wife and child.\n\nFor the rest of the day, the man didn't return. It wasn't until late at night that he came back.\n\n\"You're back.\" When the man returned, the girl greeted him with a smile.\n\n\"Mm, are you okay now?\" the man asked in a deep voice, his face expressionless.\n\n\"I'm fine. Um, thank you for yesterday,\" the girl said, showing a grateful smile.\n\n\"Mm, it's nothing.\" The man's face remained expressionless. After a brief exchange with the girl, he returned to his bedroom.\n\nThe next morning, the girl bid farewell to the man and left alone.\n\nTo investigate the \"mysterious woman burning paper money,\" Ye Bin and Zhang Lan sat in front of their computers, searching for clues online. However, neither of them found any useful information.\n\n\"Binzi, do you think this 'mysterious woman burning paper money' is a person or a ghost? We've been searching for so long and haven't found a single clue. It's too unscientific,\" Zhang Lan rubbed his neck, feeling like it was about to break from sitting at the computer for so long.\n\nHearing Zhang Lan's words, Ye Bin recalled the scene of his encounter with the mysterious girl.\n\n\"She's probably a person,\" Ye Bin murmured. Although he had the same question in his heart, deep down, he felt that the \"mysterious woman burning paper money\" was a normal person.\n\n\"If she's a person, there's no reason we can't find her,\" Zhang Lan frowned, looking at the discussions from netizens on the computer screen. There was a significant debate about whether the \"mysterious woman burning paper money\" was human or a ghost.\n\nJust as they were feeling troubled, Ye Bin's phone suddenly rang.\n\n\"Ye He.\" Ye Bin picked up his phone and was surprised to see it was Ye He calling. \"Hello, Ye He, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"Brother, I've found some clues.\"\n\n\"Clues? What clues? I thought I told you not to help me investigate anymore. Why are you still investigating on your own?\" Ye Bin asked coldly, questioning Ye He. To prevent Ye He from getting involved in the \"Route 18\" bus case, Ye Bin had instructed Ye He to avoid investigating anything dangerous when he first asked for his help. Ye Bin was afraid that Ye He's independent investigation would lead him to be associated with the \"Route 18\" bus case.\n\n\"Brother, I know you're worried. I haven't investigated the 'Blackwater Village' or the 'Route 18' bus matter you mentioned. I just investigated the 'mysterious woman burning paper money' from the internet a while ago,\" Ye He also understood Ye Bin's good intentions, so he had avoided all dangerous matters during his investigation.\n\nHearing Ye He's answer, Ye Bin's worry subsided a little. \"From now on, for any investigation, you are not allowed to conduct it yourself without my consent.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Ye He readily agreed to Ye Bin's request and then began to explain the clues he had found. \"Brother, I've processed the video clip from the internet recently. I've restored the video and identified the woman's appearance. Moreover, I've also found her identity.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 116: Ding Xiaoqian\n\n\"Ding Xiaoqian.\" Ye Bin found the name Ye He mentioned very familiar, as if he had heard it somewhere before.\n\n\"I found out she's an orphan. Her mother died of heart disease when she was young, and her father is missing and unreachable. Since there were no other relatives, she was sent to an orphanage.\" As Ye He spoke, he sent the information he had gathered to Ye Bin's computer.\n\n\"Orphanage.\" Ye Bin murmured. Upon learning that Ding Xiaoqian had lived in an orphanage since childhood, a scene of his encounter with a mysterious girl vaguely flashed in his mind.\n\n\"Don't you remember me? I'm Yaya.\"\n\n\"Yaya! It's her!\" Finally, combined with Ye He's findings, Ye Bin's mind recalled that in his memory, there was indeed a little girl named \"Yaya.\" This little girl was also an orphan from the orphanage. When he was young, he had visited the orphanage with his mother and met this little girl named \"Yaya.\"\n\n\"Brother, you know her?\" Ye He was also a little surprised to hear Ye Bin speak.\n\n\"Ye He, can you find out where Ding Xiaoqian is now?\" Ye Bin didn't answer Ye He's question and pressed on.\n\n\"I've already checked, but I only found that Ding Xiaoqian seemed to have left X City five years ago.\"\n\n\"Where did she go?\"\n\n\"J City. However, I investigated J City afterwards and couldn't find any clues related to Ding Xiaoqian. After Ding Xiaoqian left X City five years ago, she disappeared, and no clues related to her could be found.\" Ye He's investigation was very thorough; he had thought of everything Ye Bin could think of.\n\n\"Well, if there are any more questions, I will contact you. From now on, you must remember not to investigate any cases privately, understand?\" Ye Bin solemnly instructed before hanging up.\n\n\"Okay, I understand, brother. If anything comes up, you contact me. Brother, be careful.\" Ye Bin worried about Ye He's safety, and conversely, Ye He was always worried about Ye Bin's safety.\n\n\"Binzi, what do we do now? Should we ask Detective Lin for help to find this Ding Xiaoqian?\" Zhang Lan had also overheard Ye Bin's conversation with Ye He. Since Ye He couldn't find any clues about Ding Xiaoqian, Zhang Lan thought perhaps Lin Xiao might have a way to find her.\n\nYe Bin shook his head slightly at Zhang Lan's words. \"Brother Lan, I want to investigate it myself first.\"\n\n\"Binzi, isn't this Ding Xiaoqian your old flame?\" Zhang Lan said jokingly. In reality, he felt that when Ye Bin learned of the other party's true identity, he seemed to have some unspeakable feelings for Ding Xiaoqian.\n\n\"Brother Lan, you're teasing me again. You all call me a straight man all day; who would be my lover?\" Ye Bin replied with an embarrassed smile.\n\n\"You can't say for sure about this kid, I can't see through you.\" Zhang Lan chuckled, then patted Ye Bin's shoulder. His expression suddenly turned serious. \"Binzi, I can see from your face that this girl named Ding Xiaoqian seems to be very important to you. However, I still have to give you a reminder: don't let too many personal emotions interfere with solving the case, otherwise, you won't be able to find the truth of the case.\"\n\nYe Bin nodded solemnly at Zhang Lan's advice. \"Don't worry, Brother Lan, I know what I'm doing.\"\n\nAfterward, to investigate Ding Xiaoqian, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan disguised themselves and ventured to the orphanage where Ding Xiaoqian used to live.\n\n\"It seems this girl named Ding Xiaoqian is indeed unusual for you,\" Zhang Lan said jokingly as he drove towards the orphanage.\n\nYe Bin could only offer an embarrassed smile to Zhang Lan's joke. In reality, as Zhang Lan had said, Ding Xiaoqian was indeed a different existence in Ye Bin's heart.\n\nAfter driving for about forty minutes, they reached the orphanage. Upon arrival, Ye Bin contacted a teacher from the orphanage. This teacher was a classmate of his mother and was very familiar with him, and Ye Bin trusted her greatly.\n\n\"Aunt Jiang, long time no see.\" The moment Ye Bin saw Jiang Lan, he felt a sense of closeness towards her.\n\n\"You rascal, you've gotten yourself into big trouble. You never give your mother a moment's peace!\" Jiang Lan showed a very warm smile when she saw Ye Bin.\n\nYe Bin scratched his head and gave an embarrassed smile.\n\n\"Let's go, we'll talk in my office.\" Jiang Lan led Ye Bin and Zhang Lan into her office. Jiang Lan was no longer just a teacher at the orphanage; she had become the vice-dean.\n\n\"Aunt Jiang, this is my colleague, Zhang Lan.\" After entering Jiang Lan's office, Ye Bin introduced Zhang Lan to her.\n\nJiang Lan looked Zhang Lan up and down, then nodded with a smile. \"Hello, I'm Jiang Lan, Auntie to this little fellow Ye Bin.\"\n\n\"Hello, I'm Zhang Lan.\" Zhang Lan smiled and quickly extended his hand to shake Jiang Lan's.\n\n\"I trust this kid Xiao Bin, he wouldn't do anything bad. Speaking of which, you're not a bad person, are you?\" Jiang Lan's direct question made Ye Bin and Zhang Lan freeze for a moment, and an awkward expression flashed across their faces.\n\n\"Aunt Jiang, oh, don't worry. Brother Lan isn't a bad person. I'm the one who dragged Brother Lan into this mess this time.\" Ye Bin said with an embarrassed laugh, explaining to Jiang Lan.\n\n\"Really?\" Jiang Lan looked Zhang Lan up and down with suspicion.\n\nZhang Lan wore a helpless smile, letting Jiang Lan examine him without saying a word.\n\n\"Aunt Jiang, don't worry!\"\n\n\"Alas, this world is so chaotic. Tell me, what exactly happened to you, boy? Why are you wanted by the whole city? They say you're the murderer in these recent cases?\" Finally, Jiang Lan decided to trust Zhang Lan for now and then looked at Ye Bin beside her.\n\nHearing Jiang Lan's question, Ye Bin sighed, \"It's a long story.\"\n\n\"If it's a long story, then don't tell it. As long as I know you're alright, that's good enough. Tell me, why did you come to me this time? Did something happen?\" Jiang Lan trusted Ye Bin very much. Even if everyone else suspected Ye Bin, she never had any doubts, after all, she had watched Ye Bin grow up.\n\n\"I came this time to inquire about someone from you, Aunt Jiang.\"\n\n\"Inquire about someone? Who are you inquiring about?\"\n\n\"Aunt Jiang, do you know if there was someone named 'Ding Xiaoqian' in the orphanage?\" Ye Bin got straight to the point and asked directly.\n\n\"Ding Xiaoqian.\" Jiang Lan murmured, furrowing her brow in thought. After a moment, Jiang Lan seemed to recall something. \"Oh, you mean that very pretty young girl?\" Jiang Lan's memory of Ding Xiaoqian was that she was very beautiful.\n\nYe Bin nodded. \"Yes, her.\"\n\n\"Why are you asking about that girl? What's up? Did you take a liking to her?\" Jiang Lan said with a mischievous smile.\n\nSeeing Jiang Lan's expression, Ye Bin gave a helpless smile. \"Aunt Jiang, stop teasing me. This Ding Xiaoqian might be related to a case I'm currently investigating, so I want to find her.\"\n\n\"Oh, so that's how it is. However, Ding Xiaoqian left the orphanage many years ago. At that time, I remember she came back to the orphanage, saying where she was going...\" Jiang Lan tried to recall, but couldn't remember what Ding Xiaoqian had said. \"Alas, I can't remember. You should ask the girls who were close to Ding Xiaoqian back then. She's also a teacher at the orphanage now.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 117: The One She Loves\n\nWith Jiang Lan's help, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan successfully found Ding Xiaoqian's best friend, Liang Yue.\n\n\"Why are you looking for Qianqian?\" Although introduced by Jiang Lan, Liang Yue was very wary of Ye Bin and the other person, as Ye Bin and the other were currently wanted \"murderers\" by the police.\n\n\"Xiao Yue, don't worry. Jiang Yi has watched this child grow up since she was little. If you don't believe him, you can believe Jiang Yi.\" Seeing Liang Yue's wary expression, Jiang Lan quickly spoke to ease the tension.\n\n\"Jiang Yi, it's not that I don't believe you. These two are wanted 'murderers' by the police. They say they have several murder cases on their hands.\" Even with Jiang Lan's persuasion, Liang Yue still didn't believe Ye Bin and Zhang Lan.\n\nHearing Liang Yue's words, Jiang Lan also gave an embarrassed smile. \"Xiao Yue, Jiang Yi knows your worries, but Jiang Yi can assure you that this child is absolutely fine.\" Jiang Lan said this, patting her chest to guarantee it to Liang Yue.\n\nLiang Yue had been raised by Jiang Lan since she was little, so she understood Jiang Lan. Now that Jiang Lan was making such a guarantee, Liang Yue understood that Jiang Lan truly trusted Ye Bin.\n\n\"Jiang Yi, although I don't know why you trust him so much, I still have doubts about him. However, since you've guaranteed it, I'll assume Jiang Yi is right for now.\" If not for Jiang Lan's guarantee, Liang Yue would never have believed Ye Bin and the other person.\n\n\"Thank you.\" Ye Bin gave Liang Yue a grateful smile.\n\n\"You don't need to thank me. Although I believe Jiang Yi, I can tell you about Qianqian. However, don't expect to find many clues from me, because I haven't been in contact with Qianqian for nearly five years.\" In fact, after they parted ways five years ago, Liang Yue hadn't contacted Ding Xiaoqian at all.\n\nHearing this, Ye Bin nodded, then smiled and asked, \"It's okay, I just want to ask you where Ding Xiaoqian went five years ago, and why she left X City?\"\n\n\"If you ask it like that, I'm truly powerless. Five years ago, Qianqian just said she was going to find her 'lover' and left. As for why she left X City, I actually don't even know when she left X City. The last time I saw her five years ago, she just told me she was going to do something, but she didn't say what.\" Liang Yue said, recalling the last time she saw Ding Xiaoqian.\n\n\"'Lover'? Do you know who her lover is?\" When Ye Bin heard the words \"lover,\" he felt that this \"lover\" might be related to the case.\n\n\"I don't know who Qianqian's lover is. I only know that person seems very important to Qianqian. Qianqian has a toy that her lover left her. That toy has been with her for a very long time. Once, that toy was lost, and Qianqian searched for it in the heavy rain for a whole day.\" In fact, Liang Yue didn't know about Ding Xiaoqian's lover from Ding Xiaoqian herself, but it was Liang Yue's own guess. When she was with Ding Xiaoqian, she often saw Ding Xiaoqian spacing out while holding that toy.\n\n\"Now that you mention it, I also remember that little girl didn't like any pretty dolls back then, she only held a faded toy and treated it like her 'family.' I remember one time, some mischievous children from the orphanage snatched her toy. For that toy, that very quiet girl actually took a knife from the kitchen and chased after the children who took her toy. That really startled me back then!\" Speaking of the toy, Jiang Lan also recalled past events.\n\n\"'Toy.'\" Ye Bin murmured, curious about what kind of toy could make a quiet girl chase people with a knife.\n\n\"Perhaps it was left by her parents,\" Zhang Lan guessed.\n\n\"I once asked Qianqian. She said no. She also said that the toy was left to her by her only 'family.'\"\n\n\"'Only family.'\" Ye Bin murmured. He increasingly felt that the person Liang Yue was talking about was greatly related to the case. Ye Bin even guessed that Ding Xiaoqian's disappearance was likely connected to this person in some way.\n\n\"Do you know who this family member is?\" Zhang Lan's thoughts were basically the same as Ye Bin's.\n\nTo Zhang Lan's question, Liang Yue shook her head. \"Qianqian doesn't like to talk, and she doesn't like to interact with people. Even when she was with me, she rarely talked about her past.\" In Liang Yue's eyes, Ding Xiaoqian was a quiet and introverted girl.\n\n\"That's true. If I didn't remember she was a very beautiful little girl, I wouldn't have much of an impression of her,\" Jiang Lan recalled. The memories of Ding Xiaoqian in her mind were very scarce.\n\n\"This Ding Xiaoqian is quite mysterious,\" Zhang Lan sighed.\n\n\"Then do you know if she found her lover?\" Ye Bin asked Liang Yue while thinking.\n\nLiang Yue shook her head. \"I don't know about that. The last time we met five years ago, I did ask her, but she didn't say. At that time, I remember the topic was skipped because of something.\" Liang Yue knew nothing about Ding Xiaoqian's lover.\n\n\"Oh, right. I have a painting there, drawn by Qianqian. I guess that person is her lover.\" Suddenly, Liang Yue remembered that she had a portrait drawn by Ding Xiaoqian.\n\n\"Where is it?\"\n\n\"In my dorm. Please wait a moment, I'll go get it.\"\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, Liang Yue returned with a piece of 4K paper.\n\n\"This is Qianqian's painting,\" Liang Yue said, handing the painting to Ye Bin.\n\nYe Bin took the painting, and the first glance gave him a very familiar feeling.\n\nThe painting depicted a little boy holding a toy in his hand. The toy looked very much like Ultraman from television.\n\n\"This is Ultraman Tiga, isn't it?\" Zhang Lan pointed to the toy in the little boy's hand in the painting and said.\n\n\"Yes, it should be.\" Ye Bin nodded. Although the Ultraman in the painting wasn't accurate, the general outline could vaguely distinguish it as from a very popular TV series from a long time ago, \"Ultraman Tiga.\"\n\n\"Who is this little boy? To make a little girl remember him so much.\" Looking at the little boy in the painting, Zhang Lan was very puzzled. What kind of emotion could make a little girl remember someone for so many years?\n\n\"Yes, I also don't quite understand Qianqian.\" Even as a girl, Liang Yue couldn't understand why that unknown little boy could make Ding Xiaoqian remember him for so long.\n\nJust as Ye Bin, Zhang Lan, and Liang Yue were wondering who Ding Xiaoqian's lover was, Jiang Lan, who was watching the painting, looked at it for a long time and suddenly said, \"Xiao Bin, doesn't this boy look like you?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Hearing Jiang Lan's words, Ye Bin was stunned, and then he thought Jiang Lan was joking. \"Jiang Yi, you're teasing me again.\"\n\n\"No, no, no! Look at this outfit, I remember it very clearly. I bought it for you back then. Look! On these two sleeves, one is written 'Wen' and the other is written 'Wu.' Jiang Yi sewed them on specifically.\" Jiang Lan said, pointing to the two characters on the shoulders of the little boy in the painting, one reading \"Wen\" and the other reading \"Wu.\"\n\n\"Indeed, the words 'Wen' and 'Wu.'\" Zhang Lan also saw that the shoulders of the little boy in the painting indeed had two words written on them. \"Holy cow, Binzi, if this is really you, then you!\" Zhang Lan said, looking at Ye Bin with a shocked expression.\n\n\"Then that's a real coincidence.\" Ye Bin frowned, his heart filled with shock.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 118: Overlooked\n\nAfter leaving the hospital and parting ways with Chen Hui, Old Xu and his group headed to the nearest crematorium to inquire about clues regarding Li Chao and his son.\n\n\"This must be the crematorium. It looks a bit creepy,\" Old Xu murmured as the three of them left the hospital and drove to the crematorium. Due to the time, it was already around 8 PM. The large iron gate of the crematorium was open, but no one was visible inside.\n\n\"This place feels even more oppressive than the morgue,\" Ning Hua said, frowning, feeling a sense of heaviness in his heart.\n\n\"Let's go ask at the gatehouse first. If we can't get any information, we'll come back tomorrow morning,\" Old Xu suggested, also finding the atmosphere of the crematorium unnerving.\n\nNing Hua and Zhao Zhen nodded, agreeing with Old Xu's proposal.\n\nThe three of them then approached the guardhouse next to the crematorium's iron gate and knocked on the door.\n\nA scruffy old man in his sixties, yawning, opened the door.\n\n\"Who is it this late at night? What do you need?\" the old man asked, stretching lazily, clearly having just woken up.\n\n\"Hello, we are police officers. We need to investigate something here,\" Old Xu said, extending a hand to the old man.\n\n\"Police? What are you investigating in the middle of the night? All I have in here are dead people. What can you possibly find?\" The old man's attitude was poor, and he looked impatient while talking to the three of them.\n\n\"We apologize, but the case is urgent, and we need to investigate immediately,\" Old Xu continued to communicate calmly.\n\n\"It's this late. No matter how urgent your case is, it's useless. Everyone's gone home after work. Even if you want to investigate, you need people, don't you? Are you expecting the dead to help you investigate?\" The old man's words were sharp and unkind.\n\n\"What kind of way is that to talk! Can't you speak properly!\" Zhao Zhen felt irritated by the other man's terrible attitude.\n\nThe old man gave Zhao Zhen a dismissive glance. \"I speak to humans like a human, and to ghosts like a ghost. What I say depends on who you are.\"\n\n\"You!\" Hearing the old man's words, Zhao Zhen gritted his teeth and stepped forward. Old Xu quickly stepped in to stop him. \"Old Zhao, calm down. Let's focus on the task at hand.\"\n\nZhao Zhen gritted his teeth, snorted at the old man, and turned away.\n\n\"Brother, we have something very important to do. Could you please find a way to let us in to take a look?\" Old Xu said, pulling out a hundred-yuan bill from his pocket and placing it in the old man's hand.\n\nThe old man quickly pocketed the bill, then tilted his head back. \"Fine, fine. I'm a bit sleepy myself. I'll go back to sleep. But when I wake up, I don't want to see anyone.\" The old man stretched, and a set of keys clipped to his waist fell to the ground. He didn't pick them up, however, and instead turned and went back into his room.\n\nNing Hua, with quick reflexes, picked up the keys.\n\n\"We don't have much time, let's go,\" Old Xu said, signaling for the two of them to enter the crematorium after Ning Hua had picked up the keys.\n\n\"Damn it! That old guy is really something else!\" Zhao Zhen grumbled all the way, feeling very indignant.\n\nOld Xu didn't say anything about Zhao Zhen's attitude until they reached the crematorium. Old Xu then told Zhao Zhen to stop cursing.\n\n\"Ning Hua, find out where the archive room is and see if any of these keys open it.\"\n\n\"Found it,\" Ning Hua replied, picking out one of the keys.\n\n\"Alright, let's go to the archive room and see if we can find any clues.\"\n\nThe archive room was in a building behind the crematorium. Old Xu and the other two first opened the main door of the building, then split into three groups to search the three floors for the archive room. Before long, Zhao Zhen, who was responsible for the third floor, found the archive room.\n\n\"Old Xu, Ning Hua, over here!\" Zhao Zhen shouted from the staircase, his voice instantly reaching the other two due to the extreme quietness of the surroundings.\n\nOld Xu and Ning Hua ran up to the third floor.\n\n\"Ning Hua, try opening it. See if it works.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Ning Hua nodded, took out the key to the archive room, and opened the door. \"Yes, this is it.\"\n\nUpon opening the door, they first saw a computer at the entrance of the archive room. Inside, there were four or five rows of shelves filled with dense files.\n\n\"I'll see if the computer works.\" Ning Hua sat down at the computer desk and turned it on. However, when the computer booted up, it displayed a prompt for a password.\n\n\"It needs a password? Let's try 123456,\" Zhao Zhen said, immediately thinking of a very simple password when he saw the password input screen.\n\n\"A password that simple is unlikely,\" Old Xu thought, feeling the password was too simple and definitely wrong.\n\n\"It's definitely not possible!\" Ning Hua chuckled awkwardly after entering 123456, and the computer screen displayed a message indicating an incorrect password.\n\nSeeing this, Zhao Zhen frowned slightly. \"Try 654321, or maybe 123123.\"\n\n\"It's not that simple.\" Just as Old Xu rolled his eyes at Zhao Zhen, the password box on the computer screen suddenly disappeared, and the system's main interface appeared.\n\n\"It actually worked!\" Old Xu was stunned to see the computer system's main interface.\n\n\"See, I knew it,\" Zhao Zhen said proudly, smiling.\n\n\"The password was eight zeros.\" Ning Hua chuckled awkwardly again.\n\n\"...\" Old Xu and Zhao Zhen's faces both sank upon hearing this.\n\nAfter opening the computer's main interface, Ning Hua skillfully began operating the computer, searching through all of the crematorium's archives.\n\n\"There are three people named Li Chao and two named Li Yang, but their death dates are different from those of Li Chao and his son. It seems there are no records for Li Chao and his son here.\" Although they found the names Li Chao and Li Yang, based on their death dates, they could determine that neither Li Chao nor Li Yang were the people they were looking for.\n\n\"Could it be that Li Chao and his son were not cremated at this crematorium?\" Zhao Zhen reasoned, as City X had three crematoriums, so the reason they couldn't find Li Chao and his son's records might be that they weren't cremated at this particular facility.\n\n\"The other two crematoriums are nearly twice as far from the hospital as this one. That doesn't seem right,\" Ning Hua murmured, feeling confused.\n\n\"Since they aren't here, let's leave for now. Tomorrow morning, we'll investigate the other two crematoriums.\"\n\nFinally, following Old Xu's advice, the three of them left the crematorium. As it was already very late, they didn't head to the next crematorium but rented a room at a hotel not far from it. The next morning, Old Xu and the other two went to investigate the remaining two crematoriums, but to their bewilderment, neither of the other two crematoriums had any records for Li Chao and his son.\n\n\"No cremation records at any of the three crematoriums. What does this mean? Could it be that Li Chao and his son's bodies weren't cremated, but buried instead?\" Zhao Zhen speculated.\n\n\"Or perhaps there was an oversight in our investigation.\"\n\nOld Xu did not comment on Zhao Zhen and Ning Hua's conjectures, merely staring at the files on the computer screen, lost in thought.\n\n\"We've overlooked the most important thing,\" Old Xu suddenly realized something and turned to look at Zhao Zhen and Ning Hua.\n\n\"The most important thing?\"\n\n\"Li Yang's remains were not cremated. His remains were buried next to the bus stop in 'Heishui Village'.\" All along, Old Xu had been focused on finding clues that Li Chao was still alive and had overlooked matters concerning Li Yang.\n\n\"That's right! We actually forgot the most important thing. Li Yang's remains were not cremated!\" Hearing Old Xu's reminder, Ning Hua and Zhao Zhen instantly recalled the remains they had dug up near the bus stop in 'Heishui Village' – those were Li Yang's!\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 119 Question",
    "content": "Chapter 119: Problems\n\n“Li Yang’s remains were not cremated but buried near the bus stop not far from ‘Blackwater Village.’ What about what Ma Yan said about Li Chao and his son’s ashes being buried in the suburbs?” Ning Hua covered his head with one hand, feeling a splitting headache.\n\n“The crematorium did not find any cremation records for Li Chao and his son’s bodies, while ‘Blackwater Village’ found Li Yang’s uncremated remains. Based on these clues, can we conclude that Li Yang is dead, and Li Chao is still unaccounted for?” Zhao Zhen analyzed.\n\n“The hospital provided death certificates for Li Chao and his son, and Ma Yan confirmed that the bodies were indeed Li Chao and his son. If Li Chao is not dead, wouldn’t we have to suspect Ma Yan and the hospital?” Ning Hua pointed out the flaw in Zhao Zhen’s analysis.\n\n“Could it be that both Ma Yan and the hospital were wrong?” Old Xu said, looking at Ning Hua and the other.\n\n“Both wrong? What do you mean?” A hint of confusion flashed across Zhao Zhen’s and Ning Hua’s faces.\n\n“I remember the director saying that Li Yang was already unrecognizable at the time. If they only relied on Ma Yan’s judgment without conducting an identification, then it’s unknown whether the deceased was actually Li Yang,” Old Xu made a guess.\n\n“But wouldn’t the hospital identify the deceased’s identity? Moreover, even if Li Yang’s identity was misjudged due to his appearance at the time, what about Li Chao? Li Chao’s appearance should not be a problem and could be distinguished,” Ning Hua raised new doubts, not fully agreeing with Old Xu’s guess.\n\n“What I’m saying now is just a guess. We still need to find more clues to figure out what really happened,” Old Xu knew there were flaws in his guess.\n\n“Old Xu, there’s something I’ve been thinking about. The accident that killed Li Chao and his son happened five years ago. Could it be that their deaths were not accidental, or could their deaths also be related to the ‘Route 18’ bus?” After hearing Old Xu’s guess, Zhao Zhen also had his own speculation.\n\n“I thought about that too, but I investigated afterward, and there was no ‘Route 18’ bus stop sign near the scene of Li Chao and his son’s accident. However, if Li Yang’s death occurred at the ‘Route 18’ bus stop sign not far from ‘Blackwater Village,’ that would be another matter.”\n\n“Indeed, the biggest problem now is why Li Yang’s remains were found at ‘Blackwater Village.’” Zhao Zhen frowned, lost in thought, but he couldn’t figure out the reason.\n\n“I remember the remains were only half of a body.”\n\n“To be precise, it was half of a torso and a head,” Old Xu added to Ning Hua’s statement.\n\n“Then the problem arises again: why only half a torso and a head? Where is the other half of the torso?” The questions kept coming, making Zhao Zhen feel like his head was about to split open.\n\n“Regardless, the most important thing now is to continue looking for clues. If we can find more clues, perhaps we can make other discoveries.” Based on what they had found so far, Old Xu and his team were unable to clarify the various issues they were facing.\n\n“Looking for clues, easy to say. We’re like headless flies, just crashing around, not even knowing where the exit is,” Zhao Zhen sighed, a look of helplessness on his face.\n\nNot only Zhao Zhen, but even Old Xu at this moment had lost his direction. He wanted to find clues, but faced with a series of questions, he didn’t know where to start.\n\nMeanwhile, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing, who were investigating the “mysterious woman burning joss paper,” also found no clues after investigating several locations where the “mysterious woman burning joss paper” was suspected to have appeared.\n\n“Qianxing, did you find anything?” Chen Hui, having found nothing after investigating the places suspected to have appeared in the video circulating online, placed his hope on Lu Qianxing.\n\nLu Qianxing spread his hands and shook his head helplessly.\n\n“Did you find any ghosts? If you ask around, maybe you’ll find something.”\n\nTo Chen Hui’s suggestion, Lu Qianxing gave an awkward smile. “There are no lonely souls around here.”\n\n“Alas, it seems the clues have run out again.” Chen Hui sighed, a look of bitterness on his face. In the past few days of investigation, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing had investigated dozens of locations where the “mysterious woman burning joss paper” was suspected to have appeared, but the results were all fruitless.\n\nLu Qianxing said nothing, a wry smile appearing on his face.\n\n“Qianxing, you say, if ‘ghosts and spirits’ really exist in this world, then doesn’t the murderer, after killing so many people, fear retribution? When he goes to hell, won’t he be cast into the ‘eighteenth level of hell’?” Chen Hui squatted on a step by the roadside and suddenly spoke, looking at Lu Qianxing beside him.\n\n“Ah.” Hearing Chen Hui’s words, Lu Qianxing was taken aback and was momentarily speechless, not knowing how to answer Chen Hui’s question.\n\nAfter a long pause, Lu Qianxing slowly said, “I’m not very sure, but karma cycles, I think there will be retribution.”\n\n“Karma cycles, you say.” Chen Hui murmured, then a cold smile appeared on his face. “If it’s karma cycles, then perhaps those people killed by the murderer also had a cause?” Chen Hui said, turning to look at Lu Qianxing beside him.\n\n“This…” Being asked this by Chen Hui, Lu Qianxing was instantly stunned. He wanted to retort to Chen Hui’s words, but after thinking about it, he didn’t know how to refute.\n\n“Qianxing, actually, I’ve always had a question: aren’t you afraid of ghosts?”\n\n“Ghosts?”\n\n“Yes, last time I saw you interacting with that ‘ghost,’ you were very calm, so I was wondering why you aren’t afraid of ghosts?” Chen Hui looked at Lu Qianxing with confusion.\n\n“Actually, ghosts are just like people. It’s just that ghosts are a form of people after they become incomplete.” In Lu Qianxing’s mind, there was no difference between ghosts and people.\n\n“Ghosts are incomplete, does that mean people are complete?” Chen Hui murmured, as if talking to himself, or as if answering Chen Hui’s question.\n\n“Brother Hui, why did you choose to be a police officer?” In Lu Qianxing’s understanding, Chen Hui was a very timid person, so Lu Qianxing couldn’t understand why such a timid person would choose to be a police officer.\n\n“Being a police officer, huh? Are you thinking, why would I, who is so timid, choose to be a police officer?” Chen Hui seemed to see through Lu Qianxing’s thoughts and smiled slightly at Lu Qianxing beside him.\n\n“Uh, no, I’m just curious.” Hearing this, Lu Qianxing gave an awkward smile.\n\n“Actually, I used to be very brave, the kind of person who feared nothing. But…” At this point, Chen Hui fell silent, his mind recalling his mother.\n\n“People change throughout their lives, don’t they? Perhaps becoming timid is just one of my changes.” Chen Hui did not tell Lu Qianxing about his mother. All along, only Ye Bin knew Chen Hui’s story.\n\n“Changes, huh.” This time, it was Lu Qianxing’s turn to murmur. Lu Qianxing could also relate to Chen Hui’s words. Both when his father disappeared and when his mother passed away, Lu Qianxing could feel a certain change occur within him.\n\n“Alright! It’s time for reflections. Let’s get back to work. Since we can’t find any other clues, let’s go back. Perhaps Binzi and the others have made some progress,” Chen Hui finally stood up, patted the dust off his clothes, and then rushed back to the villa with Lu Qianxing.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 120: The Promise\n\n\"That's quite a coincidence,\" Ye Bin said. Looking at the two characters written on the shoulder of the little boy in the painting, and recalling his own memories, if Ding Xiaoqian was Yaya, then Ye Bin had reason to believe that the little boy in the painting was likely himself.\n\n\"Binzi, I didn't expect you to be so impressive. To have made a little girl so infatuated at such a young age, I really couldn't tell,\" Zhang Lan said, crossing his arms and appraising Ye Bin from head to toe, his voice filled with admiration.\n\nHearing Zhang Lan's words, a wry smile flashed across Ye Bin's face. \"Brother Lan, don't tease me. I was just a little kid back then, what could I have understood?\"\n\n\"Little Bin, Aunt Jiang really didn't see this. I've always worried more about you not finding a partner in the future compared to your brother. Now it seems Aunt Jiang's worries were completely unnecessary,\" Jiang Lan said, shaking her head with emotion.\n\nYe Bin's face was etched with helplessness. Faced with the words of Zhang Lan and Jiang Lan, Ye Bin didn't know how to respond. At the same time, not only Zhang Lan and Jiang Lan's perception of Ye Bin changed, but Liang Yue also began to size him up.\n\n\"You scumbag, I can't see what's so great about you either. Why did you have Qianqian so smitten?\" Liang Yue suddenly said after appraising him for a long time, causing Ye Bin's face to darken considerably.\n\n\"Calling me a scumbag to my face, the way you're acting, it's a bit much,\" Ye Bin said, his face dark. Being called a scumbag to his face, he felt rather wronged.\n\n\"And you still say you're not a scumbag? Qianqian talked about you every day since she was little. Why didn't you come to see her all this time? Why did you never look for her?\" Liang Yue had seen Ding Xiaoqian's feelings for Ye Bin clearly. Upon learning that Ye Bin might be Ding Xiaoqian's crush, Liang Yue immediately labeled Ye Bin a scumbag.\n\nYe Bin remained silent to Liang Yue's questioning, not knowing how to answer. In fact, when he heard how important he was in Ding Xiaoqian's heart, Ye Bin felt a pang of guilt.\n\n\"Little Yue, you can't put it that way. Little Bin was still a child back then, he didn't understand anything,\" Jiang Lan quickly said, speaking up for Ye Bin, seeing Liang Yue's hostile expression.\n\n\"Aunt Jiang, I don't care what your relationship is with him, but Qianqian is my childhood friend, my best friend. Five years ago, Qianqian left all for him! Moreover, if it wasn't for him these past few years, I believe Qianqian would have had a better life!\" At this moment, Liang Yue was filled with nothing but resentment and hatred towards Ye Bin.\n\n\"Young lady, what you're saying isn't right. Setting aside that Ye Bin was just a child back then, even if he wasn't, Ding Xiaoqian waited for Ye Bin for so long, and never told Ye Bin. Since that's the case, on what grounds can you impose Ding Xiaoqian's feelings onto Ye Bin?\" Zhang Lan's expression also turned grim upon hearing Liang Yue's words.\n\n\"A child? Just because he was a child then, does that mean his promise to Qianqian back then can be void? Do you know how much Qianqian paid for his promise?\" Liang Yue's emotions became somewhat agitated.\n\n\"Young lady, even if what you say is reasonable, even if Ye Bin made a promise to Ding Xiaoqian at that time, you shouldn't be a child anymore. You should understand that in this world, some promises are not binding,\" Zhang Lan retorted coldly.\n\nJiang Lan stood by the side, witnessing the scene. She wanted to say something but didn't know where to start to mediate. Neither Liang Yue nor Zhang Lan were wrong; the only difference was their differing perspectives, leading to different views.\n\nLiang Yue only saw Ding Xiaoqian, who suffered in wait for a promise, while Zhang Lan saw Ye Bin, who was undeservedly labeled a \"scumbag\" for a childish, careless remark.\n\n\"You men, none of you are good people!\" Finally, Liang Yue gritted her teeth, glared fiercely at Ye Bin, and then left without another word.\n\n\"Little Yue!\" Jiang Lan stood up to stop her, but Liang Yue had already left. \"Sigh,\" Seeing Liang Yue leave, Jiang Lan let out a long sigh, feeling utterly helpless.\n\n\"A promise made...\" Ye Bin's heart was deeply affected by Liang Yue's words. \"She was crying because of me back then.\" At this moment, Ye Bin suddenly understood why Ding Xiaoqian had cried when they first met, before he remembered her name.\n\n\"Little Bin, although Aunt Jiang knows you are not wrong, and it was a childish remark, for an orphan who lost everything, a single sentence back then was enough to influence her for a lifetime,\" Jiang Lan said, not blaming Ye Bin, but speaking from both perspectives. \"If you have the chance, regardless of your thoughts, Aunt Jiang thinks that when you meet that child, you should tell her your feelings.\"\n\n\"Aunt Jiang, I understand,\" Ye Bin nodded solemnly.\n\nAfter failing to get any clues about Ding Xiaoqian from Liang Yue, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan bid farewell to Jiang Lan and left the orphanage.\n\n\"Brother Lan, do you think I was wrong?\" As Ye Bin walked to the ground floor of the orphanage, looking at the children playing, he suddenly realized that he seemed to owe a girl far too much.\n\nSeeing Ye Bin's state, Zhang Lan stepped forward and gently patted his shoulder. \"Back then, although I said it was a childish remark, often a single sentence from one's childhood can influence a lifetime. Just as your Aunt Jiang said, regardless of your feelings for that Ding Xiaoqian, when we meet, tell her personally. A young girl waited for you for so long just for a childhood promise. I think this girl can only be described as devoted.\"\n\n\"Brother Lan, but I can't remember what that promise was.\" Since learning from Liang Yue that he had made a promise, Ye Bin had been trying to recall it, but to this day, he still couldn't remember what promise he had made back then.\n\n\"Actually, the promise itself isn't that important. What's important is the person who made the promise. I don't believe that young girl would have been so persistent for so long based solely on a promise. I think the reason she could be so persistent is that, in a sense, you might be a very important person in that little girl's heart.\"\n\n\"Important person,\" Ye Bin murmured, falling into thought.\n\nZhang Lan took a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and put it in his mouth, taking a deep puff before exhaling.\n\n\"That little girl is an orphan. I think your appearance might have given her a glimmer of hope, which is why you became the most important person in her heart. Or perhaps, to her, you might be the last 'family' she has.\"\n\n\"Family!\" Hearing Zhang Lan's words, Ye Bin was stunned. In his mind, something seemed to click.\n\n\"Brother, can you be my family?\"\n\n\"Of course, from now on, I'll be Yaya's big brother.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

That's a strange name.\"\n\n\"Qianqian is the name my mom gave me.\"\n\n\"How do you write 'Qianqian'?\" The little boy held a branch, writing in the dirt, but after thinking for a long time, he didn't know how to write the characters for \"Qianqian\" that the little girl had said.\n\n\"Is it like this?\" After thinking for a while, the little boy suddenly thought of something and quickly wrote two large characters in the dirt.\n\nLooking at the crooked two characters on the ground, the little girl shook her head. \"That's not Qianqian's name.\" As the little girl spoke, she also picked up a branch from the side and crouched beside the little boy, writing the two characters \"Qianqian\" with her tender little hands.\n\n\"Oh! So that's how it's written! This name really is strange.\" The little boy scratched his head, looking at the two characters he had written, and chuckled foolishly.\n\n\"What characters did brother write?\" The little girl looked at the two characters the little boy had written, and a look of confusion crossed her face.\n\n\"These two characters should be 'Yaya'. Heh heh.\" The little boy said, scratching his head, and showed a very childish smile to the little girl.\n\n\"Yaya.\" The little girl looked at the two characters on the ground, murmuring in her mouth, her mind wandering.\n\n\"How about I call you Yaya from now on? I forgot your name again.\" The little boy scratched his head, grinning awkwardly. In the blink of an eye, the little boy had forgotten the name the little girl had told him.\n\nLooking at the foolish smile on the little boy's face, the little girl was first stunned, and then she nodded. \"Okay, then you can call me 'Yaya' from now on.\"\n\n\"If I call you Yaya, won't you be angry?\" As soon as the little boy finished speaking, he felt his words were inappropriate and hurriedly asked the little girl.\n\n\"It's okay, as long as brother is the only one who calls me 'Yaya'.\"\n\n\"Okay, then I'll call you 'Yaya' from now on. From now on, you'll be my sister, and I'll protect you.\" The little boy said, raising his right fist.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nGood times are always short. For the little girl, the short half-day became the most important period of her life.\n\n\"Hey Binzi, why have you been spacing out all the way?\" Ever since they left the orphanage, Ye Bin had been keeping a straight face, staring blankly ahead, as if burdened by something.\n\n\"Ah, no, I was just thinking about the case.\" Hearing Zhang Lan's words, Ye Bin quickly put on an awkward smile.\n\n\"Thinking about the case? You don't look like you're thinking about the case.\" From Ye Bin's expression, Zhang Lan knew that Ye Bin must be thinking about Ding Xiaoqian.\n\n\"Brother Lan, my memory of that Ding Xiaoqian is really vague. I just vaguely recall that I seemed to have promised her something.\"\n\n\"I say, kid, you're not really falling for that little girl named Ding Xiaoqian, are you?\" Zhang Lan was a bit surprised to hear Ye Bin's words. Ye Bin's current appearance was completely different from the Ye Bin he knew.\n\nHearing this, Ye Bin nodded solemnly. \"No, I'm just wondering if she turns bad, will it be because of me.\"\n\nYe Bin's words stunned Zhang Lan. He hadn't expected that Ye Bin's thought would be to worry that Ding Xiaoqian would turn bad because of him.\n\n\"That's... that's unlikely, right?\" A wry smile flickered across Zhang Lan's face.\n\n\"According to the clues we've found, she must have some connection to the 'No. 18' bus. Otherwise, she wouldn't always appear at the crime scene exactly on time. Moreover, I have a premonition that she might even be involved in the case.\" Ye Bin's mind raced with possibilities.\n\nHearing Ye Bin's speculation, Zhang Lan also frowned. In fact, he also had a certain speculation in his heart that Ding Xiaoqian had an important connection to the case. Zhang Lan had even thought that Ding Xiaoqian might be the mastermind.\n\n\"Binzi, there's something I don't know if I should ask.\" Zhang Lan looked at Ye Bin and said in a deep voice.\n\n\"Brother Lan, just say what you need to say.\"\n\n\"If Ding Xiaoqian is really involved in the case, and it's highly possible she's the culprit, what will you do?\" Judging by Ye Bin's attitude towards Ding Xiaoqian, Zhang Lan was afraid that one day, when facing Ding Xiaoqian, Ye Bin might do something he shouldn't.\n\nHearing Zhang Lan's words, Ye Bin was first stunned, but then his gaze became very firm. \"Brother Lan, I know what you mean, but rest assured about this. I understand what should and shouldn't be done.\"\n\nAlthough Ye Bin's words were very firm, Zhang Lan didn't say anything. Instead, he gently patted Ye Bin's shoulder. \"Binzi, I don't mean anything else. It's just that you, kid, are sometimes too sentimental. Today, from your expression, I can see that you really care about that little girl. I'm just afraid that one day, this sentimentality will affect you.\"\n\n\"Affect me?\" A hint of confusion crossed Ye Bin's face. He didn't quite understand Zhang Lan's words.\n\n\"Let's go! Stop thinking about it, let's go back. Maybe Chen Hui and Old Xu over there have some leads.\" Zhang Lan didn't answer Ye Bin's question. Instead, he gently patted Ye Bin's shoulder again, and then they headed back to the villa.\n\nAlthough Ye Bin couldn't fully understand Zhang Lan's words, he vaguely understood some of what Zhang Lan meant.\n\n\"How much longer?\" In the darkness, a girl in a white dress, holding a faded toy, sat by the window and looked up at the sky, murmuring softly.\n\n\"Soon, it won't be long before I can see her.\" Beside the girl was a figure in a black robe, wearing a baseball cap. The empty eyes stared blankly ahead, and the pale cheeks gave off a chilling feeling.\n\n\"Is doing this really okay? Even if it succeeds, you won't be able to see her by then.\" The girl said, turning her gaze to the figure in the black robe beside her.\n\n\"Whether I see her or not is not important to me. As long as she can live, that's enough.\" The black-robed figure spoke coldly, his icy voice giving a sense of unfathomable depth.\n\n\"Is living enough?\" The girl murmured, then turned her gaze back to the window. \"Just wait a little longer.

Did you have any new findings?\" Before Chen Hui and the other could even enter, Zhao Zhen anxiously inquired.\n\nHearing Zhao Zhen's question, Chen Hui shook his head helplessly. \"After that, we went to several other places where the 'mysterious woman burning paper money' was rumored to have appeared, but we found nothing.\" Chen Hui said, spreading his hands. \"What about you? Did you go to the crematorium? What were your investigation results?\"\n\n\"We checked all the crematoriums in X City, and found absolutely nothing.\" Like Chen Hui, Zhao Zhen also sighed and shook his head. \"However, we suspect that the two people who died unexpectedly were likely not Li Chao and his son, after all, Li Yang's body was not cremated but buried near the bus stop not far from 'Blackwater Village'.\"\n\n\"Hmm, I overlooked that. It's true, if the remains found in 'Blackwater Village' are indeed Li Yang's, then the two bodies at the accident scene might not be Li Chao and his son.\" Chen Hui agreed with Zhao Zhen's speculation.\n\n\"If the two bodies at the accident scene are not Li Chao and his son, then who are they? Why is Li Yang's body in 'Blackwater Village'? And what about Li Chao? If Li Yang is already dead, where is Li Chao, for whom no clues have been found?\" Although agreeing with Zhao Zhen's conjecture, Chen Hui still had a string of questions.\n\n\"These are also our doubts. For now, we haven't investigated them,\" Ning Hua said with a sigh.\n\n\"Alas, in that case, everyone is the same; no one has found any clues.\" Chen Hui also sighed heavily. He had expected Old Xu's group to have some findings, but it seemed everyone was in the same boat, with no substantial clues found.\n\n\"Oh, right, where are Binzi and Fatty Lan? I don't see them.\" Seeing Old Xu's group, Chen Hui was suddenly puzzled when he didn't see Ye Bin and the other.\n\n\"What, you two don't know where they went either?\" Hearing Chen Hui's words, Old Xu's group was also confused.\n\n\"No, they should have stayed here. Something must have happened to them.\" Chen Hui's expression immediately turned serious as he spoke, a deep worry arising in his heart.\n\n\"I'll try to contact them and see if I can get through,\" Old Xu said, taking out his phone and dialing Ye Bin's number.\n\nAs soon as the phone rang, Ye Bin's voice came from the other end.\n\n\"Hello, Uncle Xu, what's up? Is something wrong?\"\n\n\"Hello, Binzi, we're back at the villa now. Why don't we see you two? Where are you?\" Old Xu asked worriedly.\n\n\"Oh, we're on our way back.\"\n\n\"Did you find anything?\"\n\n\"Yes, we've found the true identity of the 'mysterious woman burning paper money',\" Ye Bin said calmly.\n\n\"You found the true identity of the 'mysterious woman burning paper money'!\" Old Xu was stunned. This news was undoubtedly a major discovery for the current case.\n\n\"We'll be there soon. We can discuss it in detail when we get back.\"\n\n\"Alright! Be careful on your way.\"\n\nAfter Old Xu hung up, everyone's gaze turned to him.\n\n\"Old Xu, you just said Binzi and the others found the true identity of the 'mysterious woman burning paper money', is that true or not!\" Zhao Zhen was the first to speak, looking at Old Xu with excitement.\n\nOld Xu nodded. \"It should be. Binzi said they'll be here soon, and we'll know the situation when they return.\"\n\n\"If Binzi really found the true identity of the 'mysterious woman burning paper money', then it would be a major breakthrough for the case!\" Chen Hui saw a glimmer of hope upon hearing that Ye Bin had found the true identity of the 'mysterious woman burning paper money'.\n\n\"Indeed! This time, perhaps the case can be solved!\" Ning Hua also nodded.\n\nAbout half an hour later, the doorbell rang outside the villa. The moment the doorbell rang, everyone who was waiting for Ye Bin and the other stood up in unison and went to the villa's entrance.\n\n\"You're finally back.\" Chen Hui opened the door. Upon seeing Ye Bin, Chen Hui directly opened his arms and gave Ye Bin a hug.\n\n\"Uh, what's with you guys? So enthusiastic, what's up? Did you win the lottery!\" Seeing everyone standing in the doorway, Zhang Lan blinked, completely bewildered.\n\n\"Oh, Fatty Lan, you're back to being Fatty Lan!\" Seeing Zhang Lan making a joke, Zhao Zhen was a little surprised. After all, Zhang Lan had been frowning for a long time and hadn't made a joke.\n\n\"What are you talking about? I'm Fatty Lan, bah, what fatty Lan, where am I fat! Call me Slim Lan.\" Zhang Lan said, twisting his body.\n\n\"...\" Seeing Zhang Lan's appearance, everyone's expressions turned grim.\n\n\"Slim Lan, I feel uncomfortable just looking at you!\" Zhao Zhen said, shivering and getting goosebumps.\n\n\"Hahaha!\" Hearing Zhao Zhen's words, everyone smiled.\n\nAfterward, they first welcomed Ye Bin and the other back to the villa, and then everyone sat in a circle and began to question Ye Bin and the other about the \"mysterious woman burning paper money.\"\n\n\"Binzi, Old Xu said you found the true identity of the 'mysterious woman burning paper money', is it true?\" Zhao Zhen asked excitedly.\n\nYe Bin heard this and nodded. \"Yes, her name is Ding Xiaoqian. She's an orphan. We went out to investigate clues related to her.\"\n\n\"Ding Xiaoqian.\" Chen Hui murmured. He had no recollection of this name. \"Wasn't it Zhou Yi? I've always guessed that the 'mysterious woman burning paper money' was Zhou Yi.\" Chen Hui had always had a guess, though he hadn't told anyone.\n\n\"Your guess is a bit unreliable. According to the clues we have now, Zhou Yi should be a little girl. How could she be the 'mysterious woman burning paper money'?\" Zhang Lan said, directly dismissing the idea of Zhou Yi.\n\n\"Where is this Ding Xiaoqian now?\" Old Xu asked, looking at Ye Bin as he pondered.\n\n\"Ding Xiaoqian left X City five years ago and then disappeared.\"\n\n\"Left X City five years ago, which aligns with the timeline of the case. So, this Ding Xiaoqian is indeed the 'mysterious woman burning paper money',\" Ning Hua nodded.\n\n\"Ye He has already confirmed through video analysis that the 'mysterious woman burning paper money' is Ding Xiaoqian.\"\n\n\"What about the orphanage? Did you find anything?\" Old Xu asked Ye Bin, thinking.\n\n\"This Ding Xiaoqian and Binzi were childhood sweethearts.\"\n\n\"What! Childhood sweethearts!\" Hearing Zhang Lan's words, everyone looked at Zhang Lan with shock.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 123: Harboring\n\n\"Do you have a dream?\"\n\n\"I want to be a police officer.\"\n\n\"A police officer? What's so good about being a police officer? My dad said police officers only make a few hundred yuan a month and can't do anything. If it were me, I'd want to be a big businessman like my dad. Look at those big businessmen on TV, they're all so rich! They can have whatever they want.\"\n\nTwo little boys sat at their desks, talking to each other while diligently drawing the people they wanted to become on a piece of paper.\n\n\"Ah Xiao, if one day you become a police officer and I do something bad, would you still harbor me like you are now?\"\n\n\"I guess so.\"\n\nThe two little boys were made to stand outside by the teacher. Originally, only one of the boys had made a mistake, but the other boy, in an attempt to harbor him, was eventually discovered by the teacher, and both boys were disciplined.\n\n\"Okay! If one day I become a big businessman! I definitely won't forget you! Heh heh.\" The boy who made the mistake said, extending his pinky finger to the boy who had harbored him.\n\n\"Deal!\"\n\nThe originally peaceful night was broken by a sudden downpour. In a street corner alley, a man in a police uniform held a gun, pointing it at a man in a suit.\n\n\"I've kept my promise from back then! What about you! Do you still remember the promise we made? Are you still the Ah Xiao I knew!\" the man in the suit said, gritting his teeth, his face contorted.\n\nFacing the man in the suit's questioning, the man in the police uniform remained expressionless, merely holding the gun and staring grimly at the man in the suit.\n\n\"You ungrateful wretch! I treated you like a brother! And you're arresting me for a promotion!\" The man in the suit gritted his teeth, his eyes fixed on the man in the uniform, roaring.\n\n\"I am a police officer.\" Facing the man in the suit's roar, the man in the police uniform replied coldly, his tone utterly indifferent.\n\n\"Police! Hahaha! Police! Who risked their life to save you when you fell into a bandit's den and almost died!\" the man in the suit questioned fiercely. \"And who stood up to clear your name when you were framed! Officer Lin!\"\n\nTo the man in the suit's words, the man in the police uniform remained expressionless, as if everything the man in the suit said had nothing to do with him.\n\n\"Why aren't you talking? Can't answer? Officer Lin! I considered you a brother, but you are heartless and unjust to me. Is this what a police officer is!\"\n\n\"You are a criminal, and I am a police officer. My duty is to apprehend you.\" The man in the police uniform held his gun, his gaze fixed on the man in the suit, somewhat dazed.\n\n\"Take me back! Hahaha! Take me back, but what if I don't go? Pointing a gun at me! Officer Lin, if you have the guts, shoot! Shoot!\" The man in the suit roared, while shouting, he pointed the index finger of his right hand at his own chest.\n\n\"You won't shoot, right? If you won't shoot, I will!\" Seeing that the man in the police uniform ignored him, the man in the suit reached into his pocket with his left hand and pulled out a gun. But before the man in the suit could raise his gun, a crisp gunshot rang out, followed by blood seeping from the man in the suit's chest as he collapsed to the ground.\n\n\"Hahaha! Hahaha!\" The man in the suit lying on the ground burst into maniacal laughter, blood seeping from his chest, mingling with the rain and dyeing the ground red.\n\n\"Captain Lin! Captain Lin!\" a familiar voice called out. Lin Xiao's eyes snapped open, and he saw Shen Hua beside him looking at him with concern.\n\nSeeing Shen Hua's appearance, Lin Xiao was stunned for a moment. He then looked around and realized he was sitting in the passenger seat, and the car was driving towards the amusement park where the incident had occurred.\n\nAfter a moment of daze, Lin Xiao remembered that he and Shen Hua were investigating the scene of a recent case.\n\n\"Are we here?\" Snapping back to reality, Lin Xiao looked at the amusement park outside. He said nothing more, opened the car door, and was about to get out.\n\n\"Captain Lin, are you okay? You seemed to be having a nightmare just now. I saw you trembling, so I couldn't help but wake you up.\" Shen Hua gave an awkward smile, a hint of apology on his face.\n\n\"It's nothing, it's my problem.\" Lin Xiao replied calmly, then got out of the car.\n\nSeeing Lin Xiao get out, Shen Hua quickly followed and walked briskly to Lin Xiao's side. \"Captain Lin, you haven't slept properly for days investigating various crime scenes. How about we go back today? You can rest first, and we'll continue investigating tomorrow.\" Shen Hua was very concerned about Lin Xiao's safety, as Lin Xiao's face had turned somewhat pale, clearly not in good condition.\n\n\"We don't have much time. We must solve the case as soon as possible.\" Lin Xiao said calmly and then walked straight towards the amusement park ahead.\n\n\"Captain Lin, I know this case is very important, but if you push yourself this hard, I'm afraid you'll collapse before the case is solved!\" When they were driving earlier, Shen Hua had seen Lin Xiao, exhausted, holding the case investigation report and falling asleep inadvertently.\n\n\"Don't worry, I won't collapse yet. I won't collapse until the case is solved.\" Lin Xiao said calmly, his words, however, were firm.\n\nLooking at Lin Xiao's retreating back, Shen Hua sighed. At this moment, he understood why Lin Xiao, who was younger than him and also a police officer, stood ahead of him, reaching a height that commanded his admiration.\n\n\"Is it really worth it to push yourself so hard?\" Shen Hua murmured softly, as if asking Lin Xiao, but also asking himself.\n\nAlthough Shen Hua's voice was very soft, Lin Xiao heard it. When he heard Shen Hua's murmurs, Lin Xiao stopped and turned to look at Shen Hua.\n\nSeeing Lin Xiao's direct gaze, Shen Hua was stunned for a moment, then gave an awkward smile. \"Captain Lin, I didn't mean it that way.\"\n\n\"If one day, the person most important to you becomes a criminal, what would you do?\" Lin Xiao asked calmly, a hint of confusion on his face, unlike his usual coldness.\n\n\"Ah...\" Hearing Lin Xiao's words, Shen Hua was suddenly taken aback. He had never thought Lin Xiao would ask him such a question. \"I... I don't know. Maybe I would choose to harbor them.\" Shen Hua stammered, speaking his true feelings after Lin Xiao prompted him.\n\nHearing Shen Hua's answer, Lin Xiao said nothing, merely nodded slightly, then turned around again and headed towards the crime scene.\n\nShen Hua stood frozen in place, still not understanding why Lin Xiao had asked him that question. However, he didn't overthink it and quickly caught up with Lin Xiao, entering the crime scene.\n\nOnce inside the crime scene, Lin Xiao returned to his usual cold demeanor, meticulously investigating the scene. Shen Hua, on the other hand, was still puzzled by Lin Xiao's earlier question but didn't know how to ask him about it. For a moment, Shen Hua lost all desire to investigate, his mind filled only with his confusion.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "**Chapter 124: The Case Becomes More Complicated**\n\n\"Captain Lin, any new discoveries?\" Shen Hua followed Lin Xiao, his mind in a state of internal conflict. Seeing Lin Xiao suddenly stop his investigation and stare thoughtfully at the Ferris wheel in the amusement park, Shen Hua guessed that Lin Xiao might have found something and asked softly.\n\nHearing Shen Hua's question, Lin Xiao merely shook his head. In reality, even after several investigations, the results were the same as the first time. Lin Xiao hadn't found any other clues.\n\n\"I'm just thinking, is there any connection between the student who went missing from Yunxiang High School, the two people who went missing from the amusement park, and the employee who went missing from Tianmao Company earlier? Are all the missing persons in these three cases linked in some way?\" Lin Xiao murmured, voicing his thoughts.\n\n\"Connection.\" Shen Hua frowned upon hearing this. He thought for a long time but couldn't figure out what connection there was between these missing people. \"Captain Lin, I can't think of anything.\" Finally, Shen Hua showed an embarrassed smile.\n\nLin Xiao didn't answer Shen Hua, just nodded, his gaze still fixed on the Ferris wheel in thought.\n\nAfter a long while, Lin Xiao seemed to suddenly think of something and immediately turned around. \"Get in the car, let's go back to the police station. I need to confirm something.\"\n\nHearing Lin Xiao's words, Shen Hua was startled for a moment, but then he didn't think much of it and quickly got into the car, driving Lin Xiao away and back to the police station.\n\nUpon returning to the police station, Lin Xiao went back to his office, opened his computer, and began to verify his idea.\n\nAbout half an hour later, after a comparison, Lin Xiao finally found a similarity among the missing persons in the three cases.\n\n\"Captain Lin, how is it? Did you find anything?\" Seeing Lin Xiao stand up from his chair, Shen Hua immediately asked.\n\n\"In the three cases, there are four missing persons, and they all share a common characteristic. I investigated their birth dates. At first, I didn't notice anything, but just now, I investigated their birthdays according to the lunar calendar, and based on their birth charts from their lunar birthdays, I made a discovery.\"\n\n\"Birth charts.\" Shen Hua's face showed a hint of doubt upon hearing Lin Xiao's words.\n\n\"The four missing persons, their birth charts indicate they belong to the 'Extreme Yin' category in terms of their fate.\" Lin Xiao said calmly, but Shen Hua looked completely bewildered. He didn't know what Lin Xiao meant by \"fate category\" or \"Extreme Yin.\"\n\n\"Captain Lin, what does 'Extreme Yin' mean?\"\n\n\"A person born in an yin year, yin month, yin day, and yin hour is called 'Extreme Yin'.\" Lin Xiao explained to Shen Hua, then picked up his phone and called Ye Bin.\n\nAt the same time, Ye Bin and his team were sitting in the villa, discussing Ding Xiaoqian.\n\n\"Binzi, what's this about a childhood sweetheart? Did you know this Ding Xiaoqian since you were little? But that shouldn't be, I don't remember you having a childhood sweetheart,\" Chen Hui said to Ye Bin with a look of surprise. He had never heard of Ye Bin having a childhood sweetheart.\n\n\"Binzi, you're really hiding your talents,\" Ning Hua also chimed in jokingly.\n\n\"Not simple, not simple.\" For a moment, Ye Bin became the subject of everyone's discussion, allowing everyone to momentarily escape the oppressive atmosphere of the case.\n\n\". \" Faced with everyone's heated discussion, Ye Bin could only smile awkwardly.\n\nJust as everyone was in heated discussion, Ye Bin's phone suddenly rang. When Ye Bin took out his phone and saw that the caller was Lin Xiao, his expression slightly sank.\n\n\"Hello.\" Ye Bin didn't hesitate and quickly answered the call.\n\n\"Is this Ye Bin?\"\n\n\"Yeah, Detective Lin, what's up? Have you found anything?\" The moment Ye Bin saw Lin Xiao's number, he realized that Lin Xiao must have found something.\n\n\"Regarding all the missing persons from the previous cases, I've found a common characteristic among them,\" Lin Xiao said calmly.\n\n\"A common characteristic!\" Hearing Lin Xiao's words, Ye Bin also frowned slightly and then asked somewhat anxiously, \"What common characteristic?\"\n\n\"So far, all the missing persons, I've investigated their birth charts, and they all have one thing in common: they were born in an yin year, yin month, yin day, and yin hour.\"\n\n\"All the missing persons? Including the ones we investigated before?\"\n\n\"Including.\"\n\n\"Okay, I understand. I'll discuss it with Qianxing. If I find anything, I'll call you back.\"\n\n\"There's one more thing. According to Fang Chen's investigation, Li Chao's father, Li Yang, was the other deceased person in the accident five years ago, besides Zhou Yi whom we investigated earlier.\"\n\nHearing Lin Xiao's next sentence, Ye Bin's expression immediately turned grim.\n\n\"Have you found anything?\"\n\n\"We've found the true identity of the 'mysterious woman burning ghost money'.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" Lin Xiao asked calmly.\n\n\"Ding Xiaoqian.\" Ye Bin spoke Ding Xiaoqian's name.\n\n\"Have you found her?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"I'll investigate the matter of 'Ding Xiaoqian'. You all be responsible for figuring out what's going on with the commonality among all the missing persons. If you find anything, contact me again.\" Lin Xiao said and hung up the phone.\n\nAfter Ye Bin hung up the phone, the others saw Ye Bin's somber expression and immediately asked him.\n\n\"Binzi, what's wrong? What happened?\"\n\n\"Detective Lin has found the other deceased person in the accident five years ago, besides Zhou Yi.\"\n\n\"The other deceased person!\" Hearing Ye Bin's words, everyone was stunned.\n\n\"Who?\" Old Xu frowned, his gaze fixed on Ye Bin.\n\n\"Li Yang.\"\n\nAs soon as Ye Bin finished speaking, everyone was stunned, their faces showing a flicker of astonishment.\n\n\"Li Yang, how could it be Li Yang!\" Zhao Zhen was the first to speak, his heart full of questions.\n\n\"Li Yang, if it's true that Li Yang was the other deceased person in the accident five years ago, then our previous conjecture can be established. The scene where Li Chao and his father died unexpectedly, those two bodies were not Li Chao and his father, but someone else.\" Although Old Xu was startled when he first heard that Li Yang was the other deceased person at the scene of the accident five years ago, after a moment of thought, Old Xu confirmed his team's previous conjecture.\n\n\"That's true, but why would Li Yang be related to the accident five years ago? If Li Yang was a deceased person in the accident five years ago, then what about Li Chao? Could Li Chao also be related to the accident five years ago?\" Ning Hua speculated.\n\n\"Besides that, Detective Lin also found that all the missing persons were born in an yin year, yin month, yin day, and yin hour. Qianxing, what do you think about these things?\" The case was becoming more complicated, and some things couldn't be judged by common sense. Therefore, Ye Bin believed that the key to finding more in-depth clues now lay with Lu Qianxing.\n\nLu Qianxing was still thinking about the matter of Li Yang, but when he heard Ye Bin's next sentence, his expression sank. \"You mean, all the missing persons are 'Extreme Yin' people!\"\n\n\"Mmm.\"\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 125 Birth",
    "content": "Chapter 125: Birth\n\nA person born in the yin year, yin month, yin day, and yin hour is called a \"person of extreme yin.\" It is said that individuals with such birth charts can see things that ordinary people cannot, and similarly, possess certain traits that ordinary people do not have.\n\n\"Qianxing, what does 'person of extreme yin' mean?\" Upon hearing Lu Qianxing's mention of \"person of extreme yin,\" a hint of confusion crossed everyone's faces.\n\n\"Yin year, yin month, yin day, yin hour. While such people are not uncommon in the world, those with such a destiny are born with some abnormal abilities,\" Lu Qianxing frowned and began to explain to everyone.\n\n\"Abnormal? What abilities?\" Everyone looked at Lu Qianxing with curiosity.\n\n\"Yin eyes.\"\n\n\"Yin eyes, are the yin eyes you're talking about what people commonly call yin-yang eyes?\" Chen Hui thought of something and quickly asked. Like Chen Hui, everyone had heard of \"yin-yang eyes\" before, so at this moment, everyone cast questioning glances at Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"Yin-yang eyes are not yin eyes. Yin-yang eyes can only see things that ordinary people cannot. However, yin eyes possess a special ability, and this ability is called 'attracting yin'.\"\n\n\"Attracting yin.\" Hearing Lu Qianxing's words, for some reason, everyone felt a chill crawling up their backs.\n\n\"Can 'attracting yin' be understood as being able to attract unclean things?\" Old Xu analyzed based on the words Lu Qianxing used.\n\nLu Qianxing nodded, \"Yes, that's right. 'Attracting yin,' to put it simply, is the ability to attract unclean things.\"\n\n\"If that's the case, then is it because of the victim's own circumstances that they attracted the 'Route 18' ghost bus?\" Zhao Zhen propped his chin with one hand and analyzed mysteriously.\n\n\"Binzi, are all the missing persons born in the yin year, yin month, yin day, and yin hour? What about the deceased?\" Old Xu said, looking at Ye Bin beside him.\n\n\"The rest of the deceased were not born in the yin year, yin month, yin day, and yin hour.\" In response to Old Xu's question, Ye Bin flipped through the records on his phone. A comparison had already been made, and it was found that none of the deceased were \"people of extreme yin\" born in the yin year, yin month, yin day, and yin hour.\n\n\"If the deceased were not 'people of extreme yin,' then can we make a guess that the culprit's objective in the 'Route 18' bus case was these 'people of extreme yin,' and the deceased were merely unfortunate enough to have encountered the 'Route 18' bus, and thus were cursed to death?\" Old Xu quickly made a bold conjecture.\n\n\"I have a question. Did the missing persons' 'attracting yin' ability attract the culprit, or did the culprit target these people because they are 'people of extreme yin'?\" Zhang Lan asked, looking at Lu Qianxing. \"Qianxing, besides the special abilities of 'yin eyes' and 'attracting yin,' are there any other special characteristics of 'people of extreme yin'?\"\n\n\"Generally speaking, after 'people of extreme yin' die, because their fate is 'extremely yin,' their bodies can also be used for 'corpse refinement.' However, regarding 'corpse refinement,' I've only seen it in some ancient books left by my father. Whether it's true or not, I can't say for sure,\" Lu Qianxing said, shaking his head.\n\n\"'Corpse refinement.'\" Ye Bin murmured, and suddenly thought of something. He quickly asked Lu Qianxing, \"Qianxing, could 'corpse refinement' be related to 'borrowing a corpse to return a soul'!\" Ye Bin recalled Lu Qianxing's earlier mention of \"borrowing a corpse to return a soul.\"\n\nLu Qianxing directly shook his head and denied Ye Bin's question. \"The so-called corpse refinement is the process of refining a deceased person's body into a 'zombie,' and the corpse refiner can control these 'zombies.' However, borrowing a corpse to return a soul is to revive oneself by using the body of someone who has just died. One cannot revive by using a 'zombie,' and moreover, a soul cannot attach itself to a 'zombie',\" Lu Qianxing explained to everyone in detail.\n\n\"The more I listen, the creepier it gets. Why are there 'zombies' now!\" Chen Hui shivered, and involuntary images from movies flashed in his mind: a corpse, tiptoeing, with its hands raised, advancing with a hop.\n\n\"'Corpse refinement' is a forbidden art. There are very few records of corpse refinement throughout history, and I have never heard of anyone actually succeeding in corpse refinement. Therefore, I believe the culprit's objective is not corpse refinement, but something else.\"\n\n\"Besides this, is there nothing else?\"\n\n\"I don't know much about yin eyes either, only what I've told you. However, there might be records in some ancient books left by my father, but...\" Lu Qianxing sighed helplessly at this point.\n\n\"But what!\" Seeing Lu Qianxing's expression, everyone's faces showed a hint of anxiety.\n\n\"It's just that, back then, to treat my mother's illness, I sold off almost everything, except for the diary my father left behind.\" After saying that, a look of sadness crossed Lu Qianxing's face.\n\nHearing Lu Qianxing's words, everyone fell silent. No one blamed Lu Qianxing, and everyone thought about how difficult it must have been for Lu Qianxing at that time. Zhang Lan, remembering how greedy Lu Qianxing seemed when they first met, felt a pang of sadness in her heart.\n\n\"Alright, let's continue to find other methods. Perhaps Detective Lin can help.\" Zhang Lan gently patted Lu Qianxing's shoulder to comfort him, and then remembered that Lin Xiao seemed to know a master.\n\n\"I'll contact Detective Lin and see if he can help investigate some clues.\" Prompted by Zhang Lan, Ye Bin picked up his phone and dialed Lin Xiao's number.\n\nAfter talking with Lin Xiao, Ye Bin narrated all the clues they had found so far. After asking Lin Xiao for help with the investigation, Ye Bin hung up the phone.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Lin Xiao called back, but the result was somewhat disappointing. Lin Xiao had not found any information about \"yin eyes.\"\n\n\"How was it? Did you find anything? Did you get a result?\" After Ye Bin hung up Lin Xiao's call, everyone asked in unison, their faces filled with anxious anticipation.\n\n\"No. Detective Lin said that the master he knows is also unaware of these matters.\"\n\n\"It seems we'll have to rely on ourselves now,\" Chen Hui said with a sigh.\n\n\"Qianxing, regarding 'yin eyes,' besides your father's ancient books, can we find any clues from other sources?\" Since Ye Bin and the others couldn't investigate matters of the \"supernatural,\" they could only place their hopes on Lu Qianxing at this moment.\n\n\"I'll try. Maybe I can find some clues.\" Lu Qianxing didn't refuse. In fact, even if Ye Bin hadn't asked, he would have done his best to investigate.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 126: Vessel\n\n\"Hello, Lin Hong, is that you?\" Lin Xiao called the temple to investigate the matter of the \"Yin Eye.\" This time, the person who answered was Lin Hong himself.\n\n\"Yes, what's wrong? What is it?\"\n\n\"I'd like to ask if you know anything about the 'Yin Eye'.\"\n\n\"I know nothing.\" Lin Hong answered Lin Xiao's question very bluntly.\n\n\"Mm, alright then.\" After hearing Lin Hong's reply, Lin Xiao was about to hang up. Just as Lin Xiao was about to hang up, a warning voice came from the other end of the line.\n\n\"There are things that should be done, and things that should not. If you insist on doing them, you may bring disaster.\"\n\n\"Some things must be done by someone. If I don't do them, who will?\" Lin Xiao's voice was cold, questioning the other party.\n\n\"Everything is predetermined.\"\n\n\"Predetermined? Are you Lin Hong now, or Kong Jue?\" Lin Xiao asked coldly, a hint of anger in his words.\n\n\"Who I am is not important.\" Facing Lin Xiao's angry question, Lin Hong simply replied calmly.\n\n\"Lin Hong, I respect your choice, but I still hope that one day, the person who appears by my side will be Lin Hong, not Kong Jue.\" Lin Xiao said calmly, a hint of hope in his words.\n\n\"Lin Hong is Kong Jue.\" Lin Hong still replied calmly to Lin Xiao's words.\n\n\"Lin Hong has regrets, Kong Jue has no feelings.\" After saying his last sentence, Lin Xiao hung up the phone before Lin Hong could speak again.\n\nAt his desk, Lin Xiao stared blankly at the computer screen, a hint of confusion in his eyes. Shen Hua, standing beside him, was very surprised. He had only ever seen Lin Xiao as cold and decisive since he met him. He had never seen Lin Xiao look confused.\n\nShen Hua was holding a stack of documents and was about to hand them to Lin Xiao, but now he could only wait.\n\nAbout ten minutes later, Lin Xiao snapped out of his daze and regained his usual composure.\n\n\"What's wrong? Did you find anything?\" Lin Xiao looked at the stack of documents in Shen Hua's hand and asked him.\n\n\"Oh, this is all the information about 'Ding Xiaoqian'.\" Shen Hua hurriedly handed the documents to Lin Xiao upon hearing him.\n\nLin Xiao nodded, took the documents, and began to examine them.\n\nThe documents Shen Hua handed over were all the information Lin Xiao had asked him to investigate about \"Ding Xiaoqian.\" After Shen Hua's diligent investigation, he had compiled all the known information about \"Ding Xiaoqian.\"\n\n\"Besides her status as an orphan, did you not find anything else? This only has some brief information about her current situation. Why isn't there anything about her father? And why is the information about Ding Xiaoqian after she left City X blank? Are there no investigation results?\" After reviewing the information about \"Ding Xiaoqian,\" Lin Xiao placed the documents on the table and then turned his gaze to Shen Hua.\n\n\"We couldn't find any information about Ding Xiaoqian's father, only a name. As for Ding Xiaoqian's mother, after investigation, we only know that she suffered from congenital heart disease and worked as an accountant in a company. We couldn't find anything else. As for why the information about Ding Xiaoqian after she left City X is blank, I contacted an acquaintance in City J to help investigate, but Ding Xiaoqian seemed to have disappeared. After appearing once in City J, we couldn't find any more clues about her.\" Shen Hua had investigated very thoroughly, but even so, he hadn't found any key clues.\n\n\"Did you visit the 'orphanage' where Ding Xiaoqian lived? Did you investigate her social relationships in detail?\" Lin Xiao asked calmly, posing two more questions to Shen Hua.\n\nShen Hua was stunned by Lin Xiao's questions and then showed a very awkward smile. \"Uh, this...\"\n\n\"Besides Ding Xiaoqian, her mother's social relationships are also very important. Also, focus on investigating Ding Xiaoqian's father.\" Lin Xiao gave Shen Hua a hint.\n\n\"I understand.\" After hearing Lin Xiao's words, Shen Hua said goodbye to Lin Xiao and then quickly went to investigate other clues.\n\nAfter Shen Hua left, Lin Xiao opened his computer and began to search for clues about Ding Xiaoqian himself. In fact, Lin Xiao had already thoroughly investigated the clues that Shen Hua had found. The only thing that puzzled Lin Xiao now was that even he, after personally investigating, couldn't find many clues about Ding Xiaoqian's parents. The ones he did find were similar to what Shen Hua had discovered.\n\nAt the same time, Ye Bin and his team were also investigating Ding Xiaoqian. Ding Xiaoqian had now become the key figure in the case. Everyone understood that if they could find Ding Xiaoqian, they might be able to uncover the truth of the case.\n\n\"Binzi, I've asked Old Chang to investigate as well, but there's no progress on Old Chang's end. The clues Old Chang found are consistent with the clues we have.\" After Lao Xu asked Chang Hongshan to investigate, he found that Chang Hongshan's investigation results were completely consistent with what he and his team had.\n\n\"I just contacted Detective Lin. He hasn't made any progress either.\" While Lao Xu was contacting Chang Hongshan, Ye Bin had also contacted Lin Xiao, but Lin Xiao's findings were also completely consistent with the clues they had.\n\n\"Binzi, your 'sweetheart' is really not simple. So many of us are investigating, and we can't find any clues.\" Zhang Lan said playfully, looking at Ye Bin.\n\n\"Brother Lan, stop joking with me.\" Hearing Zhang Lan's words, Ye Bin's face darkened, and he said coldly.\n\n\"Speaking of which, Binzi, she's your childhood sweetheart. Don't you have any clues?\" Chen Hui also said with a smile.\n\n\"...\" Ye Bin's forehead was covered in black lines. He ignored Chen Hui's words.\n\nJust as everyone was investigating matters related to \"Ding Xiaoqian,\" Lu Qianxing, who had left earlier to investigate the \"Yin Eye,\" called.\n\nSeeing Lu Qianxing's call, Ye Bin quickly answered, \"Hello, Qianxing, what's wrong? Did you find anything?\"\n\n\"Brother Bin, do you remember what I said about borrowing a corpse to return a soul?\"\n\n\"I remember.\"\n\n\"I found a record of 'soul nurturing' in the ancient book about borrowing a corpse to return a soul. 'Soul nurturing' requires a 'body of extreme yin' to be used as a 'soul body' for nurturing.\"\n\n\"Soul nurturing? Soul body?\" Ye Bin was completely confused by Lu Qianxing's words and couldn't understand what he was talking about.\n\n\"To put it simply, it's using people born in yin years, yin months, yin days, and yin hours as a container, a container for nurturing 'souls'.\" Lu Qianxing explained.\n\n\"A container for soul nurturing?\" Ye Bin mumbled, still not understanding Lu Qianxing's meaning.\n\n\"I can't explain it clearly in a short while. I'm coming back immediately. Wait for me.\" In the end, Lu Qianxing decided to give up explaining over the phone and decided to return to the villa first.\n\n\"Okay, be careful on the way.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 127: The Murderer\n\n“Qianxing, what exactly is this 'soul nurturing' you speak of?” Lu Qianxing had just returned to the villa, and before he could even sit down, everyone anxiously inquired about the matter of “soul nurturing.”\n\nWithout rushing to answer their questions, Lu Qianxing placed a somewhat worn book on the table. “You all take a look at this first.”\n\n“What is this?” Ye Bin picked up the book from the table and flipped through a few pages, seeing detailed descriptions of “soul nurturing.”\n\nSo-called soul nurturing refers to the state where, after a person dies, the soul leaves the body and is in a weakened state. In this condition, the soul has a limited time it can remain in the mortal world. Once the soul exceeds the time it can stay, it will be unable to sustain itself and will gradually dissipate into the world.\n\nTo prevent the soul’s dissipation, a method was developed to allow the soul to remain in the mortal world for an extended period. This method is known as “soul nurturing,” which involves using a corpse with an “extreme yin” constitution to house the soul. The soul absorbs the potent yin energy from the “extreme yin body” to ensure it does not disperse.\n\nAfter reading the book’s description, Ye Bin understood the meaning of Lu Qianxing’s previous statements about “soul nurturing” and “containers.”\n\n“So, if that’s the case, the killer’s objective aligns with your earlier conjecture, relating to borrowing a corpse to house a soul. And the reason for capturing those with the 'extreme yin body' is for soul nurturing.”\n\n“Based on the clues we’ve gathered so far, if the killer’s objective is truly this, then we can essentially confirm that the killer is very likely the father of the little girl who died in an accident five years ago.”\n\nBorrowing a corpse to house a soul, coupled with soul nurturing, Old Xu already had a guess in mind. The little girl who died in an accident five years ago was a Taoist priest. To save her life, her father intended to use the method of borrowing a corpse to house a soul. To ensure the little girl's soul wouldn't dissipate, her father used people with the \"extreme yin body\" as containers.\n\n“If we extrapolate from this, then the missing people are likely…” Zhang Lan frowned and looked at Old Xu. According to Old Xu’s deduction, if everything were true and all the missing people were used as “containers,” then these people would have met a terrible fate.\n\n“Qianxing, if these people are used as containers, what happens to them?” Ye Bin turned to look at Lu Qianxing.\n\n“One mountain cannot accommodate two tigers, and one body cannot house two masters. A single body cannot contain two souls. If it’s used as a container, the soul that originally existed in the body becomes nourishment for the occupying soul. When this nourishment is depleted, if the borrowing of a corpse to house a soul is successful, the occupying soul takes possession of the body. If it fails, it becomes a case of using a soul to nurture a soul.” Lu Qianxing explained, which also corroborated Zhang Lan’s suspicion.\n\n“Hoo!” Upon hearing Lu Qianxing’s explanation, everyone let out a sigh of relief. Originally, they had thought the missing people might not be dead, but now it was confirmed that all the missing people…\n\n“If the killer is that girl’s father, then her father should be human. Does that mean that our ongoing investigation concerning the 'evil spirits' is all a deception?” Ning Hua felt that things were not as simple as they seemed. Otherwise, if the killer were indeed “human,” then the bizarre cases and the “18-way” bus stained with blood would not be possible.\n\n“Indeed, after investigating for so long, not to mention the 'ghost bus,' what we saw in the hospital morgue before, was all that fake?” Zhao Zhen also couldn’t agree with the current judgment.\n\nOld Xu frowned, sharing the same thoughts as Ning Hua and Zhao Zhen. “Based on the series of cases that have occurred, I don’t believe that mere 'humans' could have accomplished this.”\n\nWhile everyone was guessing, Ye Bin remained silent, his face grim as he fell into deep thought. After a long while, Ye Bin finally emerged from his contemplation and looked at Lu Qianxing.\n\n“Qianxing, what’s your opinion? Is the killer truly just 'human'? If it’s a Taoist priest, can they use some sorcery to achieve things that ordinary people cannot?”\n\nIn response to Ye Bin’s question, Lu Qianxing shook his head. “Although, based on the current situation, the possibility of the killer being 'human' is very high, the series of bizarre incidents related to the ‘18-way’ bus, coupled with the malevolent curse brought by the ‘18-way’ bus, even a Taoist priest cannot accomplish that. After all, a Taoist priest is also just a mortal.” Lu Qianxing provided a definitive answer.\n\n“What if, the Taoist priest is no longer human?” Ye Bin’s next statement caused Lu Qianxing to pause.\n\n“If that were the case, it would be a different matter entirely.”\n\n“Qianxing, if a Taoist priest transforms into a ‘fierce ghost,’ wouldn’t that be terrifying?” Based on Ye Bin’s words, Chen Hui also thought of something.\n\n“As a Taoist priest, they naturally know how to transform into the most terrifying ‘fierce ghost.’ Similarly, a fierce ghost formed by a Taoist priest is the most difficult to deal with. They are well aware of Taoist ghost-catching methods, and of course, they also know how to evade capture by Taoist priests. If our suspicions are correct, capturing this ‘murderer’ would undoubtedly be extremely difficult.” Lu Qianxing said, letting out a sigh of relief. His own cultivation was already insufficient, and if he encountered a Taoist priest who had transformed into a ‘fierce ghost,’ and that Taoist priest’s cultivation in life far surpassed his own, Lu Qianxing couldn’t even imagine what ability he would have to deal with such an opponent.\n\n“Now, even if we know who the killer is, are we helpless?” Zhao Zhen shook his head, sighing with some helplessness.\n\n“There are always ways. The most important thing now is to find the killer. Whether it’s a person or a ghost, we must stop them from killing any more!” Ye Bin hadn’t lost his fighting spirit just because they were helpless against the opponent. Instead, at this moment, Ye Bin was filled with determination. No matter if the opponent was human or ghost, he was determined to apprehend them.\n\n“I agree with Binzi. No matter if the killer is human or ghost, if they commit evil, they must pay the price!” Old Xu said in a deep voice, his gaze exceptionally firm.\n\n“Qianxing, if evil spirits are wreaking havoc, are there no ghost officials, like in the movies, to capture them?” Ning Hua had always been puzzled why such rampant ‘fierce ghosts’ had never been dealt with.\n\n“Yes, Qianxing, these fierce ghosts are so rampant. Aren’t there any ghost officials or anything like that?”\n\n“There is a separation between yin and yang. The yang realm has its order, and the yin realm has its order. The yang realm cannot overstep matters of the yin realm, and naturally, the yin realm cannot overstep matters of the yang realm. Originally, these ‘fierce ghosts’ should have been eliminated by Taoist priests. But nowadays, how many people in the world can truly be called Taoist priests? And how many possess true abilities?” Lu Qianxing said, letting out a long sigh, a hint of melancholy in his heart.\n\n“Binzi, why don’t we become Taoist priests too? That way, when we encounter cases like this again, we won’t be so powerless.” Chen Hui said with a wry smile, looking at Ye Bin.\n\n“What’s this, are you thinking of becoming a monk, you kid?” Before Ye Bin could respond to Chen Hui’s words, Zhang Lan, who was beside them, joked.\n\n“I can be a lay disciple,” Chen Hui replied shrewdly.\n\n“Haha.” After Zhang Lan and Chen Hui eased the atmosphere, everyone’s taut nerves relaxed a little, and a smile appeared on their faces.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 128: Abandoned Residential Area\n\nNearly a month had passed since the public outcry in City X had died down. During this month, although no new cases related to the \"Route 18\" bus had occurred in City X, public attention had begun to shift away from the previous crackdown on crime and back to the \"Route 18\" bus case.\n\nOver the course of this month, Ye Bin and Lin Xiao had been investigating. While they still hadn't found the perpetrator of the \"Route 18\" bus case, their investigations had yielded some breakthroughs. After extensive inquiries, they finally found some leads regarding Ding Xiaoqian.\n\n\"This is Ding Xiaoqian's potential location,\" Ye Bin said, pointing to a marked spot on the map of City X as he looked at everyone.\n\n\"How was this location obtained?\" Everyone looked at the spot on the map with some confusion.\n\n\"Just now, Detective Lin, while reviewing surveillance footage from around all the crime scenes, spotted Ding Xiaoqian who had previously appeared at a crime scene.\"\n\n\"Did the surveillance footage around the crime scenes capture Ding Xiaoqian?\" Old Xu was the first to raise a question. After all, they had searched through the video files sent by Lin Xiao multiple times before, and had not found any trace of Ding Xiaoqian.\n\n\"She was found in the dashcam footage of a vehicle.\"\n\n\"Dashcam footage?\" Hearing Ye Bin's explanation, everyone was stunned.\n\n\"According to Detective Lin, he searched through all the vehicles that appeared around the crime scenes, and after painstakingly reviewing them one by one, he fortunately found Ding Xiaoqian leaving a crime scene in the dashcam footage of one vehicle. Subsequently, using other surrounding surveillance, he traced her movements and finally determined Ding Xiaoqian's location, which should be around here,\" Ye Bin finished, pointing to the marked spot on the map of City X again.\n\n\"This should be close to the village,\" Old Xu said, magnifying the map. He finally discovered that the marked location on the map was only about two kilometers away from the village.\n\n\"It's the abandoned residential area closest to the village,\" Zhao Zhen and Ning Hua said simultaneously. When they were investigating the area around the village, Zhao Zhen's group had discovered a residential area less than two kilometers away. The abandoned area only had three buildings, with one building half-demolished. The other two buildings, although not demolished, were already uninhabited. When Zhao Zhen's group had investigated at the time, they had also inspected the abandoned area but found nothing.\n\n\"This residential area was originally an illegal construction. After the incident in the village, it's said that residents here could hear crying every night. Eventually, due to various rumors, all the residents of the area moved out. Later, the government stepped in for demolition, but halfway through, they were blocked by the original residents, seemingly because the demolition compensation wasn't agreed upon. After that, the area has remained abandoned until now,\" Old Xu's investigation was very thorough, but because he found no information related to the case after investigating this abandoned residential area, he had overlooked it.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, did you inspect all the floors in the residential area back then?\" Ye Bin asked, looking at Old Xu.\n\n\"Yes,\" Old Xu nodded. \"We entered the abandoned residential area at the time, including the half-demolished building. We entered and inspected it, but found nothing. Moreover, that place shouldn't be habitable at all.\" Recalling the investigation at the time, Old Xu clearly remembered that the abandoned residential area had deteriorated to a point where it was completely uninhabitable.\n\n\"That's right! How could anyone live in that residential area! There's nothing there. Could the location be wrong?\" Zhao Zhen also asked doubtfully. He also didn't think anyone would live in such a dilapidated residential area.\n\n\"Whether it's wrong or not, let's go and investigate,\" Ye Bin stated.\n\nEveryone, including Ye Bin and Zhang Lan, drove two cars to the abandoned residential area for investigation. After about an hour's drive, they arrived outside the abandoned residential area, which was less than two kilometers from the village.\n\nNot far from the abandoned residential area, they parked the cars by the roadside. They walked through the weeds for a full ten minutes before successfully entering the abandoned area.\n\n\"Just to get here, we walked for more than ten minutes. How could anyone possibly live in a place like this!\" Chen Hui exclaimed, not believing anyone would live in such a desolate place.\n\n\"The yin energy here is very heavy,\" Lu Qianxing said, frowning slightly as he stood before the three abandoned buildings.\n\nHearing Lu Qianxing's words, everyone was taken aback. Immediately, they instinctively moved closer, especially Chen Hui, who stood tightly beside Lu Qianxing, gripping his sleeve, afraid of encountering something terrifying.\n\n\"Qianxing, there won't be anything here, right?\" Chen Hui's gaze scanned the surroundings, but apart from the three lonely tall buildings in front of them, there was only overgrown weeds.\n\n\"Everyone be careful. I feel something strange about this place,\" Lu Qianxing said. He took out a talisman and lit it, but after the talisman burned out, Lu Qianxing did not detect anything unusual.\n\n\"Well, if that's the case, let's go together.\" Although the group would investigate faster if they split up, after hearing Lu Qianxing's words, they decided to act together.\n\nYe Bin and his group first entered the building closest to them.\n\nThe building was not tall, only six floors. Each building also had only three units. After Ye Bin and his group inspected the first unit and found nothing, they proceeded to the second and third units. After inspecting all three units, they found no abnormalities and no signs of habitation.\n\n\"There's no water or electricity. It's impossible for anyone to live in this place,\" Zhao Zhen became even more convinced that no one could live in the abandoned residential area after inspecting the building.\n\n\"It's not necessarily that Ding Xiaoqian lives here. Maybe she just came here for something,\" Chen Hui also didn't believe anyone lived in the abandoned residential area, but he thought perhaps Ding Xiaoqian came here for a specific reason.\n\n\"Let's go inspect the second building first. Only after we've fully investigated can we make a judgment.\" Although Ye Bin also didn't believe Ding Xiaoqian would live here, he hadn't made a judgment yet without a complete investigation.\n\nThus, the group continued to inspect the second building. Since the second building was half-demolished, only one unit remained out of the three units. After carefully inspecting the only remaining unit, the group reached the same conclusion as before.\n\n\"Qianxing, are you alright?\" After inspecting the second building, Ye Bin looked at Lu Qianxing and asked.\n\nWhen they entered the two buildings to inspect, Ye Bin had noticed that Lu Qianxing had been wearing a solemn expression, as if deep in thought.\n\n\"I'm fine. I just feel that it's a bit oppressive here, a feeling I can't quite describe,\" Lu Qianxing actually couldn't explain where the sense of oppression in his heart came from.\n\n\"Is it related to the heavy yin energy you mentioned earlier?\" Old Xu also asked with concern.\n\n\"Perhaps. However, when I was outside, I could indeed feel a heavy yin energy. But once inside here, I can't feel that yin energy anymore; instead, it's a feeling of oppression,\" Lu Qianxing said, letting out a sigh.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 129: The Predicament\n\nAfter investigating the first two buildings, Ye Bin and his group arrived at the third building.\n\n\"Qianxing, your complexion isn't good. Are you alright?\" Upon arriving at the third building, Ye Bin noticed that Lu Qianxing's face was a little pale, as if his mental state had deteriorated.\n\n\"I'm fine. I just suddenly feel that the oppressive feeling from before is getting stronger. This third building likely has something in it, so everyone should be careful.\" As they approached the third building, Lu Qianxing felt uneasy all over, as if an invisible force was pressing down on him, making it difficult to breathe.\n\n\"How about you wait for us here?\" Old Xu was also a bit worried. Lu Qianxing's face was extremely pale at the moment, making him look sickly.\n\n\"Qianxing, did you pick up something unclean?\" Chen Hui swallowed, a terrible thought crossing his mind as he saw Lu Qianxing's pale face.\n\nHearing Chen Hui's words, everyone was stunned.\n\n\"Qianxing, are there any abnormalities with your body?\" Ye Bin asked, stepping forward to support Lu Qianxing, then placing his hand on Lu Qianxing's forehead.\n\nThe moment Ye Bin's hand touched Lu Qianxing's forehead, Ye Bin's expression instantly darkened. \"Qianxing, why is your forehead so hot! Do you have a fever?\" Feeling Lu Qianxing's burning forehead, Ye Bin showed deep concern.\n\nSeeing this, Old Xu also hurried forward, grabbing Lu Qianxing's right hand. \"Your hands are ice-cold. It is a fever, alright. Qianxing, did you have a cold before coming here?\" Old Xu looked at Lu Qianxing. Based on Lu Qianxing's current symptoms, Old Xu didn't think these symptoms had just appeared; they likely had been present for some time.\n\n\"No. I just felt a bit oppressive here, and then my body felt a bit unwell,\" Lu Qianxing's voice became weak, and his appearance was very haggard.\n\n\"Could it really be that something followed him?\" With Chen Hui's earlier speculation, Zhao Zhen also harbored a sense of foreboding.\n\n\"Don't worry. Although my cultivation is shallow, I can still sense if something has followed me,\" Lu Qianxing said weakly, answering Zhao Zhen's question.\n\n\"When did these symptoms start?\" Ye Bin asked Lu Qianxing with a hint of anxiety. After all, Lu Qianxing had been perfectly fine before this, with no issues whatsoever.\n\n\"When I first got here.\" In truth, Lu Qianxing himself was also full of questions. He had been fine before, but ever since coming to the abandoned community, he felt that his mental state and body seemed to have been affected by something, declining rapidly.\n\n\"It seems this place is indeed strange.\" Old Xu frowned and, along with Ye Bin, supported the haggard Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"I think we should send him to the hospital quickly. Looking at his complexion, he's in very bad shape,\" Zhao Zhen said, suggesting they leave immediately seeing Lu Qianxing's pale face and weakened state.\n\n\"Indeed. Since this place is strange, let's leave for today. Without Qianxing, if we encounter something we shouldn't, it could be dangerous,\" Ning Hua also suggested. After all, Lu Qianxing himself said the place was strange, and apart from him, the others were incapable of dealing with anything unclean. If they encountered something like what happened in the morgue before, they would surely be in peril.\n\nFollowing Ning Hua's suggestion, everyone nodded in agreement. Then, Ye Bin and Old Xu helped Lu Qianxing, and the group headed towards the road outside the abandoned community. However, after walking for not long, Lu Qianxing fainted, making Ye Bin and his group even more worried about his safety, and they quickened their pace.\n\nRetracing their steps along the path they came, they walked for nearly half an hour but still hadn't reached the road. This made a sliver of doubt arise in everyone's hearts.\n\n\"Strange, we've been walking for almost half an hour, why haven't we seen the road yet? Normally, the community isn't far from the road!\" Chen Hui looked around. Apart from the weeds, there was only the receding abandoned community behind them.\n\n\"Did we get our direction wrong?\" Zhao Zhen frowned, trying to orient himself, but then he shook his head. \"That shouldn't be it. The main gate of the abandoned community faces north, so our direction is correct. But why haven't we seen the road after walking for so long?\" Zhao Zhen said, then stood on tiptoe to look forward, but due to the dense weeds covering the path, he could only see endless piles of weeds.\n\nYe Bin frowned, sensing that something was amiss.\n\n\"Could we have fallen into an illusion?\" Having had the experience in Blackwater Village, Chen Hui wondered if they were in an illusion like before.\n\n\"Qianxing has fainted, and without him, we can't determine if we're in an illusion,\" Ning Hua gritted his teeth, feeling anxious.\n\n\"Ah!\" Just as everyone was wondering what was happening, Zhao Zhen suddenly let out a shout, then looked at Old Xu with a bewildered expression.\n\n\"Old Xu! What are you doing!\" Zhao Zhen questioned Old Xu while rubbing his arm. Just now, he had felt a sudden pain in his arm, and when he turned around, he saw Old Xu pinching his arm fiercely.\n\n\"I was just trying to determine if we were in an illusion.\" Seeing the pained Zhao Zhen, Old Xu showed an awkward smile.\n\n\"Why didn't you pinch yourself!\" Zhao Zhen's eyes widened, his face filled with anger.\n\n\"I couldn't bring myself to do it.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhao Zhen's face darkened, and a black line appeared on his forehead. He really didn't know how to refute Old Xu's answer.\n\n\"It seems we haven't fallen into an illusion,\" Old Xu quickly said, changing the subject.\n\n\"If we go by the situation in the previous illusion, we indeed shouldn't have fallen into an illusion.\" Recalling the events they encountered in Blackwater Village before, Ye Bin also made his judgment.\n\n\"If we haven't fallen into an illusion, then we took the wrong road?\" Zhang Lan frowned and said. She didn't believe their group had taken the wrong road.\n\nYe Bin turned his head and looked at the abandoned community, which had shrunk to a tiny spot behind them, falling into deep thought.\n\n\"Even if we took the wrong road, we didn't walk tens of miles, but at least a few dozen miles. Even if it was the wrong way, we shouldn't have walked this long and still not reached the end,\" Chen Hui's gaze swept across the surroundings. They seemed to be trapped in a vast sea of weeds, stretching as far as the eye could see.\n\n\"Should we try going back?\" Ning Hua thought that since they couldn't get out, they should return the way they came.\n\n\"It's not that simple. I think we might have encountered something strange.\" Lu Qianxing's sudden fainting, coupled with the inability to return, made Old Xu feel that things were not that simple.\n\n\"All this time, we've only been looking for Ding Xiaoqian. Could it be that we were careless and the other party noticed, and so...\" Zhang Lan had a guess in her heart.\n\n\"This possibility is indeed there. But, who is this Ding Xiaoqian, that she can trap us in this place!\" Zhao Zhen's face was stern. He felt that if everything was indeed Ding Xiaoqian's doing, then Ding Xiaoqian must be no ordinary person.\n\n\"A ghost?\" Chen Hui muttered, then trembled all over and shivered deeply.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 130: Breaking Free\n\nFollowing the clues provided by Lin Xiao, Ye Bin and his group headed to a derelict residential complex less than two kilometers away from Blackwater Village. However, upon arriving at the complex, Lu Qianxing suddenly developed a fever and fell unconscious. As Ye Bin and his group attempted to leave, they found themselves trapped, unable to escape the vicinity of the abandoned complex no matter how they walked, constantly circling around it.\n\n\"Damn it! We've been walking for a whole day, and it's almost dark, yet we're still wandering around this broken place!\" Ye Bin's group had been walking for nearly a day. Now, the sun was setting, and night was approaching.\n\n\"Binzi, how is it? Can you make a call?\" At this point, everyone had given up on aimless walking, sitting down where they were and contemplating other solutions.\n\n\"The signal is full, but there's no data, and I can't make calls,\" Ye Bin said with a grim expression, looking at the full signal bars on his phone with a sigh of helplessness.\n\n\"What exactly is trapping us here without showing itself? What does it want?\" Zhao Zhen had lost his patience after being exhausted for nearly a day and was extremely agitated.\n\n\"Qianxing's fever has subsided, and his hands have returned to normal temperature, but he still shows no signs of waking up,\" Old Xu checked Lu Qianxing's condition. Lu Qianxing had now returned to normal, his face flushed, but no matter how Ye Bin and the others called out, Lu Qianxing remained unconscious.\n\n\"Qianxing has a lot of talismans in his pockets. I wonder if they can be useful,\" Chen Hui felt through Lu Qianxing's pockets, pulling out a stack of talisman papers and a somewhat worn-out Bagua compass.\n\n\"Even if there are useful talismans, they are useless without the incantations,\" Ye Bin understood that Lu Qianxing would mumble certain incantations whenever he used talismans, so without the incantations, the talismans themselves were of no use.\n\n\"This compass, I remember Qianxing used it once when we were looking for Sun Xitao,\" Zhang Lan recalled the scene of looking for Sun Xitao while looking at the worn-out Bagua compass in Chen Hui's hand. At that time, Lu Qianxing had used the compass to find the location of Sun Xitao's house.\n\n\"Could this compass be able to guide us?\" Ning Hua also had an idea as he looked at the Bagua compass in Chen Hui's hand.\n\n\"The needle on it keeps spinning. It hasn't stopped since I picked it up. I don't think we can rely on it to guide us,\" Chen Hui handed the compass to everyone to look at.\n\nThe needle of the compass spun rapidly, sometimes clockwise, sometimes counterclockwise. Even when it stopped, it would only stay in one place for less than two seconds before turning in another direction.\n\nYe Bin ignored Chen Hui's words, took the compass from Chen Hui's hand, and held it himself. Then, Ye Bin stared intently at the compass.\n\n\"Binzi, be careful you don't get dizzy. Just carrying Qianxing is tiring enough for one person. With you too, I can hardly believe we can get out,\" Chen Hui spread his hands and said helplessly.\n\n\"The rotation of this compass seems to have a pattern,\" Old Xu stood beside Ye Bin, observing the compass with him. After a while, Old Xu seemed to have discovered something from the rotating compass.\n\n\"A pattern, really!\" Hearing Old Xu's words, Zhang Lan also leaned in, but after watching for a while, he gave up. Looking at the strange characters on it, coupled with the constant rotation of the compass needle, Zhang Lan just felt dizzy.\n\n\"Every time the compass needle stops, it seems to point in a direction, and after rotating twelve times, the compass starts to rotate in reverse, and the direction of rotation seems to be opposite to before,\" Ye Bin observed very carefully and had seen through the rotational pattern of the compass.\n\n\"It is said that the Bagua compass has the ability to discern good and bad fortune. If that's the case, can the pattern of this compass's rotation be used to identify good and bad fortune?\" Ning Hua recalled scenes from movies he had watched, where some Taoist priests used compasses to find their way and avoid danger when encountering perilous situations, thus finding a path to survival.\n\n\"The problem now is, even if we know this compass can discern good and bad fortune and help us out of this predicament, can you guys understand it?\" Zhao Zhen looked at Ye Bin and Old Xu with doubt.\n\n\"I told you all to read more when you had the chance. You were all just playing on your phones. When it matters, your phones fail, and then you're helpless,\" Old Xu said, picking up a wooden branch from beside him.\n\nSeeing Old Xu pick up the wooden branch, everyone, including Ye Bin, was stunned.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Yeah, Old Xu? What's up? You understand this?\" Zhao Zhen also looked at Old Xu with surprise.\n\n\"When I was young, out of curiosity, I studied some I Ching and Bagua, and I have some understanding of the Bagua,\" Old Xu said, then looked at the compass, held the twig in his right hand, and began to write on the ground.\n\n\"Xu, northwest; Chen, southeast; Wei, southwest.\" Following the positions indicated by the compass needle when it stopped, Old Xu soon marked all the directions on the ground.\n\nThe people beside Old Xu had their mouths half-open, their faces filled with shock and admiration.\n\n\"Old Xu! Oh my, I didn't realize! You have this ability.\"\n\n\"Uncle Xu! It's a shame you didn't become a Taoist priest, really, really, sigh.\" Chen Hui said emotionally.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, you really are hiding your talent!\" Ye Bin also said with immense admiration.\n\nOld Xu remained very composed in the face of everyone's admiring expressions. \"Remember to read more books in the future, good books.\"\n\n\"I've learned, I've learned!\" Chen Hui nodded solemnly.\n\nWhen Old Xu finished writing, the ground was already covered with various directional terms.\n\n\"Old Xu, what's next? Can you understand it?\" Looking at the various directional terms on the ground, Zhao Zhen was still confused; he still couldn't understand.\n\n\"Next, we need to seek good fortune and avoid disaster, and find a path to life,\" Old Xu said, then picked up the branch again, circled a few directional terms, and then drew a line connecting them.\n\nLooking at the line drawn on the ground, everyone felt the arrival of hope.\n\n\"It's getting late. Let's get out before dark!\" Finally, Old Xu took a photo of the line drawn on the ground with his phone, and then began to walk according to the direction of the line.\n\nFollowing Old Xu's footsteps, after about twenty minutes, they finally saw the long-lost road.\n\n\"My God! We're really out!\" Zhao Zhen was so excited that tears welled up as he looked at the two cars parked by the roadside.\n\n\"Old Xu! I'm impressed!\" Chen Hui gave Old Xu a thumbs-up, his admiration for Old Xu reaching its peak.\n\nJust as everyone's attention was on Old Xu, Ye Bin's gaze sharpened slightly, and then he said in a deep voice.\n\n\"Everyone, have you seen? It seems there's a person sitting in our car.\"\n\nHearing Ye Bin's words, everyone was stunned, and then their gazes turned to the two cars parked by the roadside.\n\n\"Who! Who's in the car!\" Chen Hui shivered, feeling a chilling breeze sweep down his spine.\n\nOn the two cars parked by the roadside, in the passenger seat of one of the cars, there was a blurry figure.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

Just as everyone was preparing to drive away, they noticed a faint human figure in a car parked by the roadside.\n\n\"Since we can see it, it should be a person in the car,\" Chen Hui recalled encountering a \"ghost\" when he and Lu Qianxing were investigating the case of the \"mysterious woman burning joss paper.\" At that time, he couldn't see the other party, only hear their voice. Therefore, Chen Hui reasoned that if the person in the car were truly a \"ghost,\" his group shouldn't be able to see them.\n\n\"Who would come to this place? Besides, I clearly remember locking the car before we left,\" Zhao Zhen frowned, disagreeing with Chen Hui's statement.\n\n\"Whether the other party is human or ghost, since they are in our car, I believe they are most likely waiting for us,\" Old Xu opined. He reasoned that their presence in their car indicated the person was there specifically for them.\n\n\"Qian Xing is still unconscious. If the other party is truly a ghost, won't it be too dangerous for us to approach rashly?\" Ning Hua said, his face grim, his gaze fixed on the car by the roadside. However, as it was already late, he couldn't make out who was inside.\n\n\"Since we've seen him, he must have seen us too. If it's a person, we have nothing to fear. If it's a ghost, and it's targeting us, even if we don't go, I don't think we can escape,\" Ye Bin assessed the situation.\n\n\"Let's go. Ghost or human, since they've appeared, they've set their sights on us. If we run away and don't face this, how can we solve the 'Bus Route 18' case?\" Although Zhang Lan felt a little scared, he understood that since they had chosen to investigate, fear was meaningless.\n\nUpon hearing Zhang Lan's words, everyone nodded in agreement and slowly approached the car by the roadside.\n\nWhen they were less than five meters from the car, through the car window, they could vaguely make out the figure sitting in the front passenger seat.\n\nIt was a young girl in a white dress, with long, black hair cascading over her shoulders. Although her face was unclear, everyone had a feeling that she must be a beauty.\n\n\"Ding Xiaoqian.\" Upon confirming that it was a girl in the car, Chen Hui immediately thought of someone.\n\nYe Bin's face was solemn as he gazed at the front passenger seat. The moment he saw the girl, even though he couldn't see her face clearly, he had already made a judgment: the girl in the passenger seat was the mysterious girl he had encountered at the street corner before.\n\n\"Binzi, judging by your expression, is that the girl you saw before?\" Old Xu noticed the change in Ye Bin's face and asked him.\n\n\"Yes, it should be correct,\" Ye Bin nodded, his eyes never leaving the girl.\n\nAs everyone was deep in speculation, the passenger door of the car opened, two feet stepped out, and then a girl appeared, whose beauty could captivate everyone present.\n\n\"So beautiful!\" Chen Hui stared blankly at the girl stepping out of the passenger seat, completely smitten.\n\n\"It seems our guess was correct.\" Old Xu appeared relatively calm. Although the girl's beauty was enough to captivate any man, Old Xu was not mesmerized by her appearance.\n\n\"A beauty that could topple cities and kingdoms is probably no more than this,\" Zhang Lan sighed, also marveling at her beauty.\n\n\"Is this what it feels like to be in love?\" The moment Ning Hua saw the girl, his heart began to race, and a feeling of love welled up in his heart.\n\n\"How happy would I be if my wife were this beautiful?\" Zhao Zhen sighed lightly, a hint of melancholy crossing his face.\n\n\"Old Zhao, aren't you afraid your wife will find out when you say something like that?\" Old Xu gave Zhao Zhen a look and said sternly.\n\n\"What hero doesn't admire a beauty?\" Zhao Zhen sighed again.\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"I've been waiting for you for a long time. It seems you remember me now.\" While everyone was still captivated by the girl's beauty, she looked at Ye Bin and suddenly spoke.\n\n\"You are Ding Xiaoqian.\" Ye Bin didn't answer the girl's question but instead asked her back.\n\nThe girl nodded slightly. \"Mm.\"\n\n\"The 'person burning joss paper' who appeared at the crime scenes, that was you, wasn't it?\" Ye Bin's words were very direct, cutting straight to the chase.\n\nHearing Ye Bin's words, surprise flickered across everyone's faces. No one expected Ye Bin to question such a breathtakingly beautiful woman so directly.\n\n\"Binzi is really a straight arrow!\" Chen Hui shook his head slightly, saying with emotion.\n\n\"The person burning joss paper was indeed me, but burning joss paper by the roadside shouldn't be illegal,\" Ding Xiaoqian replied calmly to Ye Bin's question.\n\n\"There is evidence of your presence at every crime scene we are investigating. I don't think these are mere coincidences,\" Ye Bin's voice was cold, as if he were interrogating her.\n\n\"I am not aware of the cases you are referring to,\" Ding Xiaoqian stared at Ye Bin, her words still very calm.\n\n\"It's fine if you're not aware, but I hope you can cooperate with our investigation.\"\n\n\"Since you remember me, don't you have anything to say to me?\" A hint of grievance appeared on Ding Xiaoqian's face.\n\n\"I apologize for what happened when we were children,\" Ye Bin said plainly, his words somewhat cold.\n\nHearing Ye Bin's words, disappointment immediately flashed across Ding Xiaoqian's face. She wanted to say something, but in the end, she swallowed her words.\n\n\"I'm here this time only to tell you to stop investigating,\" Ding Xiaoqian continued to speak calmly, but within her calm words, a deep concern could be felt.\n\nHearing Ding Xiaoqian's words, Ye Bin ignored her and directly asked, \"Do you know anything about the case?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You don't know? Then why are you telling me not to investigate?\"\n\n\"Soon, everything will be over.\"\n\n\"Until the real killer is found, the case will never be over,\" Ye Bin said coldly.\n\n\"You will be in danger if you continue investigating,\" Ding Xiaoqian continued to persuade Ye Bin.\n\n\"I am a police officer.\" Ye Bin looked at Ding Xiaoqian with firm eyes, causing Ding Xiaoqian to pause.\n\n\"Up to now, too many people have died in this case. If you know something, I hope you can tell us.\" Although Ye Bin understood that Ding Xiaoqian was somehow related to the case, for some reason, he had immense trust in the Ding Xiaoqian before him, believing she hadn't harmed anyone.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I don't know,\" Ding Xiaoqian's reply was very firm.\n\nSeeing Ding Xiaoqian's resolute expression, Ye Bin simply nodded and then said coldly again, \"In that case, please accompany us.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 132: A Smile\n\nFollowing Ye Bin and his group, Ding Xiaochian arrived at the villa where Ye Bin and the others were staying.\n\n\"Binzi, should we notify Detective Lin?\" After bringing Ding Xiaochian back to the villa, Chen Hui quietly asked Ye Bin.\n\n\"Not for now.\" Ye Bin answered Chen Hui in a low voice before holding a cup of hot water and handing it to Ding Xiaochian. \"Drink it while it's hot.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Ding Xiaochian took the hot water from Ye Bin, took a small sip, and then placed the cup on the table.\n\n\"Binzi, how do you plan to investigate?\" Knowing that the relationship between Ye Bin and Ding Xiaochian was somewhat delicate, Zhang Lan was also a little worried. He was concerned that Ye Bin might feel conflicted due to his relationship with Ding Xiaochian.\n\nYe Bin did not answer Zhang Lan's question. Instead, he sat directly opposite Ding Xiaochian and then coldly asked, \"Miss Ding, can you explain why you were present at various crime scenes?\"\n\nHearing Ye Bin's direct questioning of Ding Xiaochian, Zhang Lan shook his head helplessly and stood aside, leaving the task of investigation to Ye Bin.\n\n\"I like to wander around alone late at night. I appeared at the crime scenes perhaps because I wander in many places, so I happened to pass by.\" Ding Xiaochian appeared very calm in response to Ye Bin's inquiry.\n\n\"Is it really such a coincidence?\"\n\n\"There are many coincidences in this world. Isn't our meeting also a coincidence?\" Ding Xiaochian said plainly.\n\n\"Alright, if it's a coincidence, may I ask why, Miss Ding, you were burning joss paper late at night?\"\n\n\"I was commemorating my deceased mother. Is that not allowed either?\"\n\n\"Of course, it is. But I have another question. Why does Miss Ding frequently commemorate her deceased mother? And why does Miss Ding always choose to commemorate her mother at the same time as the crime incidents? Are all of these also just coincidences?\" Ye Bin asked coldly, questioning Ding Xiaochian.\n\n\"If you don't believe these are coincidences, then please provide any evidence that proves I am involved in the cases you are investigating.\" Ding Xiaochian retorted.\n\n\"You're clearly just quibbling!\" Zhao Zhen, who was standing nearby, couldn't contain his anger upon hearing Ding Xiaochian's words and spoke indignantly.\n\n\"All of this was originally just a coincidence. If you don't believe what I'm saying, then please provide evidence.\" Ding Xiaochian said calmly, ignoring Zhao Zhen's anger.\n\n\"You!\" Zhao Zhen gritted his teeth, wanting to say something, but he didn't know how to start. After all, as Ding Xiaochian said, they couldn't find any concrete evidence connecting Ding Xiaochian to the cases. Everything was just their speculation.\n\n\"Old Zhao, calm down.\" Old Xu gently patted Zhao Zhen's shoulder, then turned his gaze to Ding Xiaochian. \"Miss Ding, although we don't have enough evidence to prove your substantial involvement in the cases, if we attribute everything to coincidence as you say, I don't think that will clear you of suspicion.\"\n\n\"You police officers should prioritize evidence. If there's no evidence, on what basis do you call me a suspect? Just because I coincidentally appeared at the crime scene?\" Ding Xiaochian looked at Old Xu with icy eyes, speaking calmly.\n\nFacing Ding Xiaochian's words, Old Xu could only frown slightly.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, leave it to me.\" Ye Bin glanced at Old Xu beside him and said calmly, then turned his gaze back to Ding Xiaochian.\n\n\"Miss Ding, I believe you are not the culprit, but I hope that if you know anything, please tell us. This case has already involved too many lives. If this continues, City X, and even society as a whole, will be plunged into fear.\" Ye Bin knew that no matter how much he continued to question, he wouldn't get any results, so Ye Bin changed his approach.\n\n\"Why do you believe me?\" Hearing Ye Bin say he believed her, Ding Xiaochian was momentarily taken aback. However, her expression remained calm, as if Ye Bin's words had no impact on her.\n\n\"I've seen too many merciless criminals. In their eyes, I can see a malevolence that blinds them, but I don't see any malevolence in your eyes. Instead, your eyes are very clear. In them, I only feel a tenderness, so I believe you.\" Ye Bin's words were very plain, but it was these plain words that stirred up a wave in Ding Xiaochian's heart.\n\nAlthough a wave stirred within her, Ding Xiaochian's expression remained calm, showing no outward change.\n\n\"Aren't you afraid that the tenderness in my eyes is just a facade?\"\n\n\"People can lie, but eyes cannot.\" Ye Bin looked directly at Ding Xiaochian and spoke calmly.\n\n\"Then what if I'm not human?\" Ding Xiaochian's next sentence caused everyone present, including Ye Bin, to slightly grimace.\n\nSeeing Ye Bin's face fall in an instant, a faint smile crossed Ding Xiaochian's face. \"What? Have you never considered that I might not be human?\"\n\nYe Bin's lips curved into a smile, and his expression returned to normal. \"Your eyes tell me you're lying.\"\n\n\"I only know that things will end soon, and no one will die anymore. For your safety, it's best you don't continue investigating this case.\" Ultimately, Ding Xiaochian only gave the same answer as before, and did not mention the killer of the case.\n\n\"Is that your answer?\" Ye Bin asked calmly, his gaze fixed on Ding Xiaochian.\n\n\"You have your duty, and I have my responsibilities. Some things must be protected, even if one is trapped in a predicament and covered in wounds.\" As she finished this sentence, a smile appeared on Ding Xiaochian's face.\n\nLooking at the smile on Ding Xiaochian's face, Ye Bin felt many emotions: helplessness, sadness, and determination.\n\nFinally, to everyone's bewilderment, Ye Bin let Ding Xiaochian leave without continuing the investigation.\n\n\"Binzi, why did you let her go? You don't actually have feelings for her, do you?\" After Ding Xiaochian left, Chen Hui was the first to ask Ye Bin.\n\n\"I believe her.\" Ye Bin replied to Chen Hui's question with a smile.\n\n\"Believe her? What do you mean by believing her? Binzi, she's our only lead! Letting her go is like letting go of the clue!\" Chen Hui looked at Ye Bin in utter confusion, completely failing to understand what Ye Bin meant.\n\n\"You kid, you still lack cultivation.\" Ye Bin didn't answer Chen Hui's question. Instead, Zhang Lan, standing beside Ye Bin, walked over to Chen Hui and gently patted his shoulder.\n\nChen Hui's confusion deepened at Zhang Lan's words. \"Huh? Cultivation? What cultivation?\"\n\n\"That girl isn't a bad person. In her smile, there's helplessness and sadness. I think there must be some reason behind it.\" Old Xu let out a long sigh and shook his head slightly.\n\n(End of chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 133: Reasons\n\nThe autumn night wind wasn't particularly cold, but it carried a lonely chill.\n\n\"If we do this, will she really come back?\" A girl in a long dress stood beside a man in black sportswear, asking softly.\n\nHearing the girl's question, the man didn't reply. Instead, he gazed into the distance, lost in thought for a moment. After a long while, his voice grew a little deep as he slowly said, \"This is the last resort. No matter what, I have to bring her back. I promised her.\"\n\n\"If only I had a father like you,\" the girl said, a faint smile on her face.\n\nThe man shook his head slightly and then spoke with a hint of self-reproach, \"I'm not a responsible father.\" After speaking, he let out a long sigh and slowly closed his eyes. Moments later, two lines of tears streamed down his face.\n\n\"I've always had a question I wanted to ask you. Why didn't you stop me when I did this?\" The man slowly opened his eyes, wiped the tears from their corners, and turned to look at the girl behind him.\n\n\"I had no reason to stop you,\" the girl replied plainly, her demeanor indifferent to his words.\n\n\"Reason?\" The man was taken aback, finding the girl's words quite surprising.\n\n\"When I was very young, I became an orphan. At that time, all I remembered was the person who saved me. Other than that, I only had one friend from the orphanage. Everyone else had nothing to do with me,\" the girl answered in a very calm tone.\n\n\"The person who saved you? Is it the boy you mentioned before?\"\n\n\"Yes. I only know his name. I don't know anything else about him.\"\n\n\"Haven't you looked for him all these years?\" a hint of doubt crossed the man's face.\n\nThe girl shook her head slightly. \"No. However, I heard that he seems to have become a police officer.\"\n\n\"A police officer,\" the man murmured. Then, he asked the girl, \"If one day you meet him, and he asks you about me, will you tell him?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the girl replied calmly, which made the man freeze again.\n\n\"Why?\" the man asked, confused.\n\n\"I don't want to lie to him,\" the girl answered resolutely.\n\n\"Then aren't you afraid I'll kill you?\" The man's gaze turned somewhat cold, and the girl could feel a trace of killing intent in his eyes.\n\n\"I'm not afraid,\" the girl still replied with utter calm, showing no fear of the man's threat.\n\nSeeing the girl's serene expression, the man could only shake his head helplessly. He then walked to her side, gently patted her shoulder, and said, \"Don't worry. You'll meet one day.\"\n\nThe day after Ding Xiaoqian left, the news reported an accidental death. To the shock of Ye Bin and the others, the deceased in the accident was Ding Xiaoqian, who had left the previous day.\n\nUpon hearing this news, since Ye Bin and Zhang Lan could not rush to the scene to investigate, Old Xu and his team had to go to the accident site to conduct the investigation.\n\n\"Binzi, are you okay? You look unwell. I think you should go rest.\" Since learning of Ding Xiaoqian's accidental death, Ye Bin had not uttered a single word, remaining seated alone in front of the coffee table, lost in thought.\n\nYe Bin seemed not to have heard Zhang Lan's words, still sitting blankly in front of the coffee table, his eyes gazing ahead without focus.\n\n\"Sigh...\" Looking at Ye Bin's state, Zhang Lan sighed helplessly, then picked up the phone and called Old Xu.\n\n\"Hello, what's the investigation result?\"\n\n\"The female corpse we saw at the accident site is wearing the exact same clothes as Ding Xiaoqian yesterday. However, the deceased suffered extensive burns, and her facial features are unrecognizable. We can only identify her based on the tattered clothes and the autopsy.\" Old Xu's voice came from the other end of the phone.\n\n\"Can you confirm the deceased is Ding Xiaoqian?\"\n\n\"I've already reviewed the autopsy report. After comparison, it is indeed Ding Xiaoqian,\" Old Xu said, then asked with concern about Ye Bin's condition. \"How's Binzi? Is he any better? And has Qianxing woken up?\" Besides Ye Bin, Old Xu was also worried about Lu Qianxing. After all, Lu Qianxing had been in a coma since returning from the abandoned residential area and had not yet woken up.\n\n\"Binzi's condition isn't good,\" Zhang Lan said, glancing at Ye Bin, who was still sitting blankly in front of the coffee table. \"As for Qianxing, he hasn't woken up, but everything is stable. He should be fine.\" Just moments ago, Zhang Lan had checked Lu Qianxing's physical condition, and everything was normal.\n\n\"Okay, we'll head back immediately after we finish the investigation here.\"\n\n\"You be careful.\"\n\nAfter hanging up the phone, Zhang Lan sat down next to Ye Bin. \"Binzi, are you alright?\" Zhang Lan asked softly, looking at Ye Bin beside him with concern. In all the time Zhang Lan had known Ye Bin, he had never seen Ye Bin in such a state, as if he had suffered a great shock and was on the verge of breaking down.\n\nYe Bin still acted as if he hadn't heard Zhang Lan's question, his unfocused eyes staring straight ahead.\n\nYe Bin sat blankly in front of the coffee table for a while. Then, as if recalling something, he turned to Zhang Lan beside him. \"Lan Ge, do you think Ding Xiaoqian might not be dead? Maybe the person at the accident scene wasn't Ding Xiaoqian.\"\n\nHearing Ye Bin's words, Zhang Lan frowned slightly, then let out a long sigh and said helplessly, \"Binzi, I know you're upset and can't accept this fact, but the autopsy report is out. The deceased at the accident scene is indeed Ding Xiaoqian.\" In reality, at first, not only Ye Bin but also Zhang Lan had doubts. However, after Old Xu and the others confirmed it, Zhang Lan had to accept the fact.\n\n\"Didn't Uncle Xu just say that the female corpse's face was so badly burned that her appearance couldn't be discerned? Maybe the deceased isn't Ding Xiaoqian. Maybe there was some oversight. Why don't we go to the scene and investigate?\" Ye Bin at this moment was completely different from his usual self. His eyes were filled with avoidance.\n\n\"Binzi, I know you're feeling miserable, but since Old Xu and the others are already investigating, if there were any anomalies, I'm sure he would tell us. Besides, the crime scene is swarming with police officers. If the two of us show up, wouldn't we be walking into a trap?\" Zhang Lan hadn't expected that Ding Xiaoqian's incident would cause Ye Bin to lose his composure so much.\n\nHearing Zhang Lan's words, Ye Bin nodded and didn't say anything further.\n\n\"Binzi, the case isn't over yet. Pull yourself together,\" Zhang Lan stepped forward, gently patted Ye Bin's shoulder, and said in a deep voice.\n\nYe Bin frowned, gritted his teeth, closed his eyes, and let out a long breath before finally calming down. \"I understand, Lan Ge.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 134: Hope\n\n\"Uncle Xu, there's no 'Route 18' bus stop around here.\" Chen Hui and Ning Hua were meticulously investigating the area around the accident scene where Ding Xiaoqian had unexpectedly died, but neither of them could find a \"Route 18\" bus stop nearby.\n\n\"If that's the case, Ding Xiaoqian's death has nothing to do with the 'Route 18' bus. This means Ding Xiaoqian's death could truly just be an accident.\" No abnormalities were found at the accident scene, and similarly, there was no \"Route 18\" bus stop. Zhao Zhen believed Ding Xiaoqian's death was genuinely just an accident.\n\n\"Saying it's an accident, but I still feel it's a bit too coincidental.\" Chen Hui felt something was amiss. After all, they had only just met Ding Xiaoqian, and the very next day, she met with an accident. To call such an event a coincidence was hard to believe.\n\nOld Xu paid no mind to Chen Hui and Zhao Zhen's words. Instead, he stared at the corpse covered by a white sheet at the accident scene, lost in thought.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, if you're finished with your investigation, we'll be taking the body away,\" a young police officer said softly to Old Xu, asking him.\n\nOld Xu snapped out of his deep thought and nodded hastily. \"Alright, thank you for your trouble.\" The young officer had worked with Old Xu on a case before, and Old Xu had provided him with a lot of help. Therefore, the young officer held Old Xu in high regard. This time, if it weren't for this young officer, it wouldn't have been easy for Old Xu and his team to access the accident scene.\n\n\"It's nothing. Speaking of which, Uncle Xu, I heard you resigned. What's the story? There's a rumor in the precinct that Officer Ye is the murderer in the recent homicide cases. Is any of that true?\" Ye Bin was quite well-known among the younger officers in the force, and the young officer was one of Ye Bin's admirers. However, upon hearing that Ye Bin was the murderer in the homicide cases, the young officer had developed a question. Now that he saw Ye Bin, he couldn't help but ask.\n\nHearing the young officer's question, Old Xu's brow immediately furrowed. At this moment, he truly didn't know how to answer. After a long period of contemplation, Old Xu shook his head and slowly said, \"The real killer hasn't been found yet. Ye Bin is the prime suspect, but I can't make a judgment until the truth is clarified.\"\n\n\"I've had some interactions with Officer Ye before. Back then, Officer Ye even saved me once. I feel like Officer Ye would never be the killer. If he confessed, there must be a reason for it.\" The young officer's next words surprised Old Xu. He hadn't expected that besides their own group, someone else was willing to believe in Ye Bin.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Old Xu said with a smile, looking at the young officer.\n\nBefore the police took the body away, Old Xu examined it once more, but he found no further abnormalities. However, after examining the body, a thought arose in Old Xu's mind. He had a feeling that the corpse wasn't Ding Xiaoqian, but someone else entirely.\n\n\"Old Xu, what do we do now? Should we go back?\" Seeing the body being transported away, Zhao Zhen felt that staying at the accident scene any longer wouldn't be very meaningful.\n\n\"I need to go to the police station.\"\n\n\"The police station? What for?\" Zhao Zhen looked at Old Xu, somewhat confused.\n\nOld Xu didn't answer. Instead, he took out half of a transparent plastic bag from his pocket.\n\nSeeing the half transparent plastic bag Old Xu pulled from his pocket, Zhao Zhen was startled for a moment, then understood. \"You mean?\"\n\n\"I have a feeling there's something wrong with the autopsy report. I managed to get a strand of hair and a fingernail clipping from the deceased. If I give them to Old Chang, maybe we can find something,\" Old Xu whispered into Zhao Zhen's ear.\n\n\"You old fox, you're quite cunning.\" Zhao Zhen smiled with admiration on his face.\n\n\"Time is of the essence, let's go!\"\n\nAfter Old Xu and Zhao Zhen explained the situation to Chen Hui and Ning Hua, they all drove to the police station to seek Old Chang's help.\n\n\"Just this one strand of hair? And a fingernail clipping?\" Old Chang frowned as he looked at the two pieces of evidence in the plastic bag handed to him by Old Xu.\n\n\"With your abilities, it shouldn't be a problem.\"\n\n\"Doing DNA identification won't be an issue, but if the DNA database doesn't have the DNA data for this Ding Xiaoqian you mentioned, we won't be able to determine the results.\" Old Chang walked over to the identification equipment and began to process the two items.\n\n\"This Ding Xiaoqian used to live in an orphanage. There's some of her information there, including her DNA data.\" Before coming to the police station, Old Xu had asked Ye Bin to investigate. Ye Bin, in turn, had asked Jiang Lan to look into Ding Xiaoqian's information. They eventually discovered that Ding Xiaoqian had undergone a DNA paternity test when she was looking for her biological father, so the orphanage retained her DNA data from that time.\n\n\"Hmm, in that case, it should be fine.\"\n\n\"Old Chang, we won't disturb you. We'll wait outside for you.\" To avoid interfering with Old Chang's work, Old Xu and Zhao Zhen left the police station and went to meet up with Chen Hui and the others.\n\n\"How is it? Any results yet?\" Seeing Old Xu and Zhao Zhen emerge, Chen Hui immediately stepped forward with a confused look, asking anxiously.\n\n\"DNA identification results don't come that quickly!\" Before Old Xu could speak, Ning Hua, standing behind Chen Hui, interjected.\n\n\"It'll probably take a while. Have you contacted Binzi? Is he feeling any better?\" When Old Xu had spoken to Ye Bin earlier, he had sensed that Ye Bin was not in a good state, and now he was worried about Ye Bin again.\n\n\"We contacted him. Binzi isn't doing well.\" Chen Hui was the one who contacted Ye Bin. When Ye Bin answered the phone, Chen Hui could sense that Ye Bin was in a terrible condition, completely unlike his usual self. \"Although Binzi didn't say it, you could tell that this Ding Xiaoqian seemed very important to Binzi, otherwise, he wouldn't be like this.\" Thinking of Ye Bin's weak and listless voice, Chen Hui couldn't help but feel a sense of melancholy.\n\n\"Let's wait for the identification results. If the deceased is not Ding Xiaoqian, then Binzi won't have any problems.\"\n\n\"Even so, if the identification results are consistent with the autopsy results, what then?\" Hearing Chen Hui's words, Zhao Zhen was also very worried that Ye Bin wouldn't be able to pull himself together.\n\n\"Don't worry, that kid Binzi won't be defeated.\" Old Xu had the most confidence in Ye Bin. He firmly believed that Ye Bin was not someone who could be easily defeated by any one thing.\n\n\"Let's hope so. Sigh.\" Zhao Zhen sighed deeply.\n\nIn the villa, Ye Bin was still sitting in front of the coffee table, staring blankly. However, at this moment, when he heard that the deceased at the accident scene might not be Ding Xiaoqian, a sliver of hope appeared in Ye Bin's heart. Although the hope was slim, for Ye Bin, even a little bit of hope was better than no hope at all.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 135: DNA\n\nAfter Old Xu and the others handed over the hair and nails obtained from the body to Chang Hongshan for investigation, the group did not leave. Instead, they waited outside the police station for news from Chang Hongshan.\n\n\"Old Xu, if the investigation results come out and the deceased is really not Ding Xiaoqian, where do you think Ding Xiaoqian went?\" While everyone was waiting for the investigation results, Zhao Zhen had been pondering a question: if the deceased at the accident scene was not Ding Xiaoqian, where would the real Ding Xiaoqian have gone?\n\n\"More than that, I'm more concerned about who the deceased's true identity is if it's not Ding Xiaoqian,\" Old Xu replied, not answering Zhao Zhen's question, but voicing his own doubts.\n\n\"Who else? I think it's bound to be another innocent person murdered by the killer,\" Zhao Zhen said, sighing. Facing a ruthless killer, all they could do now was wait.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, do you think the deceased at the accident scene is really Ding Xiaoqian?\" After Zhao Zhen and Old Xu finished talking, Chen Hui stepped forward and asked Old Xu.\n\n\"Without evidence, I can't make a definitive conclusion. However, I suspect the deceased at the accident scene is not Ding Xiaoqian.\" From the beginning, Old Xu had been skeptical about the deceased's identity, which is why he had asked Chang Hongshan for help investigating the hair and nails from the body.\n\n\"Mmm.\" Hearing Old Xu's answer, Chen Hui nodded and didn't ask further questions.\n\nAfter Old Xu and his team waited outside the police station for nearly half a day, Chang Hongshan finally rushed out with a stack of documents.\n\nUpon seeing Chang Hongshan emerge, Old Xu and his group immediately surrounded him.\n\n\"How is it? Old Chang, what are the results?\"\n\n\"This is the DNA identification report. You can take a look yourself,\" Chang Hongshan said, handing the stack of documents to Old Xu.\n\nOld Xu took the documents and quickly flipped through them, examining them carefully.\n\nAfter flipping through two or three pages, Old Xu's face darkened, his brows furrowed, and a look of confusion appeared on his face.\n\n\"What does this identification result mean? Why are there two people's DNA data on it?\" Old Xu pointed to the identification report in his hand and looked at Chang Hongshan doubtfully.\n\n\"As you can see, according to the identification, the DNA in the hair and the DNA in the nails originated from two different people.\"\n\n\"Two people? What do you mean?\" Old Xu frowned, memories of the accident scene flooding his mind. At the time, he had indeed collected hair and nails from the body.\n\n\"Old Xu, are you sure both of these items were collected from the deceased?\"\n\n\"If I can't even be sure of that, then I've been a police officer for nothing,\" Old Xu said coldly, his gaze firm.\n\n\"The DNA from the nails is completely consistent with Ding Xiaoqian's DNA, which was found at the orphanage. However, the DNA data from the hair belongs to another person.\"\n\n\"Another person? Who is that person?\" Old Xu quickly asked.\n\nChang Hongshan shook his head slightly, a hint of helplessness on his face. \"I checked the DNA database, and I didn't find the other person. The DNA database does not contain that person's DNA.\" After the identification results were out, Chang Hongshan had entered the police station's DNA database, but after comparison, he had not found any DNA data related to the other person.\n\n\"Two types of DNA on one person, is that possible?\" Chen Hui murmured, wondering if a person could possess two sets of DNA simultaneously.\n\n\"Theoretically speaking, this situation is impossible,\" Ning Hua, standing beside Chen Hui, said, negating Chen Hui's idea.\n\n\"It's not entirely impossible. There is one situation where a person might have two types of DNA,\" Zhao Zhen said suddenly, interrupting everyone's discussion.\n\n\"What situation?\" Old Xu looked at Zhao Zhen beside him with confusion.\n\n\"Organ transplant.\"\n\n\"Organ transplant?\" Old Xu murmured, suddenly understanding. He then turned to Chang Hongshan and asked, \"Old Chang, is this possible?\"\n\n\"There have been such cases before.\"\n\n\"So, did Ding Xiaoqian undergo an organ transplant?\"\n\n\"It seems we need to investigate the deceased's body again.\" To know if the deceased had an organ transplant, the simplest method now was to re-examine the body.\n\n\"Old Chang, did you find anything else?\"\n\nIn response to Old Xu's question, Chang Hongshan spread his hands and shook his head helplessly.\n\n\"In that case, let's go and investigate the body first. If we find anything new, I'll contact you.\"\n\nFinally, after giving Chang Hongshan some brief instructions, Old Xu and his team quickly departed to continue their investigation.\n\n\"Hello, Xiao Tian, it's Xu Jiang. Has the body been transported back to the police station yet?\" On the way, Old Xu began contacting the young police officer from before.\n\n\"Oh! Uncle Xu, the body was just transported back to the police station. What's wrong?\"\n\n\"We've discovered something related to the case we're investigating, so we want to investigate the deceased's body again.\"\n\n\"Okay, Uncle Xu. Then please come to the police station, and I'll take you to investigate. But you need to be quick. If my supervisor returns later, it will be difficult.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, we're already on our way and will be there soon.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nAfter talking with the young police officer, Old Xu and his team drove at full speed and arrived at the police station where the young officer was located in less than half an hour.\n\nUpon arriving at the police station, the young police officer was already waiting at the entrance.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, you're here.\" Seeing Old Xu and his group get out of the car, the young police officer greeted them with a smile.\n\n\"I'm really sorry to have caused you trouble,\" Old Xu said apologetically.\n\n\"No need to be so polite, Uncle Xu.\"\n\nHearing this, Old Xu didn't exchange any more pleasantries. \"Xiao Tian, where is the body? Let's hurry and investigate. Otherwise, if your supervisor returns, it will cause you unnecessary trouble.\"\n\n\"Okay, the body is in the morgue. Please follow me.\" The young police officer said nothing more and quickly led Old Xu and his group towards the morgue for the investigation.\n\nWhen they arrived outside the morgue, the young police officer was about to lead Old Xu and his team inside to investigate, but at that moment, he discovered, for some reason, that his access card could not open the morgue door.\n\n\"Strange? I went in earlier, why can't I open the door now?\" The young police officer swiped his access card on the machine repeatedly, but he still couldn't open the morgue door.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, please wait a moment. I'll make a call and ask a colleague to help. My card might be broken.\" The young police officer scratched his head, a slightly embarrassed smile on his face.\n\n\"It's alright, it's alright.\"\n\nAfter about five minutes, the young police officer called a colleague to help open the door, but to everyone's surprise, his colleague's access card also couldn't open the morgue door.\n\n\"Strange, is the lock broken?\"\n\nAfterward, the young police officer contacted the police responsible for managing the morgue and asked them to operate the computer to open the morgue door. However, something even more surprising happened: the computer controlling the morgue door had crashed at that moment, and for a time, there was no way to open the morgue door.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 136: The Unopenable Door\n\nOutside the police station's morgue, Old Xu, along with his group and several police officers, were discussing the matter of the morgue door being unopenable.\n\n\"That's strange. This has never happened before. Not only are everyone's access cards in the police station invalid, but even the computer controlling the morgue door has crashed. Several technicians have been here, but they still haven't fixed it,\" the young police officer said with a frown, feeling helpless about the situation.\n\n\"Are only the morgue's doors not opening with the access cards?\" Based on the current situation, Old Xu had a bad feeling.\n\n\"Yes. I just went to the evidence room, and the access cards are fine. Currently, only the morgue's door cannot be opened.\" At first, the young police officer thought the access cards were broken, but after testing them at other locations, he found that other doors were unaffected, with only the morgue's door posing a problem.\n\n\"This is truly uncanny. No other place has issues, only here. Could there be something unclean inside?\" a colleague of the young police officer murmured, a terrifying thought dawning in his mind.\n\n\"Don't say that. It's entirely possible. I heard from a retired old police officer that the morgue has had hauntings more than once. There was even an incident where a body in the morgue inexplicably fell to the floor, scaring a female police officer so much that she was transferred to another department,\" the young police officer's colleague recounted a \"supernatural\" event related to the morgue.\n\n\"Is that true!\" Hearing his colleague's words, the young police officer shivered instantly.\n\n\"Who can say if such things are true or not? Anyway, places like morgues generally have all sorts of 'supernatural' events rumored about them.\"\n\n\"Uncle Xu, something's not right,\" Chen Hui whispered in Old Xu's ear, a hint of worry crossing his face.\n\nOld Xu nodded slightly, not saying anything.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, I'm really sorry. It's a bit embarrassing to encounter something like this,\" the young police officer said with a wry smile, not expecting to encounter such a situation.\n\n\"It's alright. No one could have predicted this. Rather, we've caused you trouble,\" Old Xu replied with a smile, a hint of apology on his face.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, my superior will be back soon. Also, it might be quite difficult to open the morgue door today. Why don't you come back to the police station tomorrow morning? Then you can investigate the body,\" the young police officer said helplessly, looking very apologetic.\n\nOld Xu didn't want to cause trouble for the young police officer, so he nodded and agreed. Afterward, Old Xu and his group drove away from the police station and returned to the villa, planning to investigate the body the next morning.\n\n\"Old Xu, do you think the morgue incident might be related to Ding Xiaoqian? Or perhaps, related to the 'murderer'?\" On the way back to the villa from the police station, Old Xu and his group discussed the case in the car.\n\n\"All access cards suddenly malfunctioning, the computer controlling the morgue door breaking down – to describe such a situation as a coincidence, I don't think it's likely,\" Old Xu said in a deep voice. He had already made up his mind that the morgue incident was definitely related to Ding Xiaoqian.\n\n\"This kind of thing needs Qianxing to resolve it. Otherwise, we have no idea what's really going on.\" Regarding the morgue incident, everyone was at a loss and couldn't figure out what had happened. Ning Hua believed that if Lu Qianxing were present, the outcome might be different, as Lu Qianxing understood \"supernatural\" matters.\n\n\"Speaking of which, hasn't Qianxing woken up yet? It's been quite some time. Could it be that Qianxing has come into contact with something unclean?\" Since returning from the abandoned residential area, Lu Qianxing had been in a coma. This made Zhao Zhen suspect that Lu Qianxing might have come into contact with something unclean.\n\n\"If Qianxing had woken up, I'm sure Binzi would have contacted us. Since Binzi hasn't contacted us yet, I think Qianxing definitely hasn't woken up,\" Old Xu analyzed Zhao Zhen's statement. In reality, it was as Old Xu analyzed; Lu Qianxing remained in a coma until this day.\n\n\"Should we contact Detective Lin? He seems to know a master who might be able to help,\" Ning Hua suggested.\n\n\"Binzi told me not to tell Detective Lin about Ding Xiaoqian's matter. Let's wait a bit longer and discuss it with Binzi and the others when we get back.\" Chen Hui had previously asked Ye Bin, and Ye Bin had told Chen Hui at that time not to inform Lin Xiao about Ding Xiaoqian's matter for the time being. Therefore, Chen Hui felt that Ye Bin must have had a reason for doing so.\n\n\"Since that's the case, let's wait and discuss it with Binzi and the others when we get back.\" Hearing Chen Hui's words, Ning Hua didn't say anything more.\n\nThe group drove back to the villa, and after a journey of nearly an hour, they finally arrived.\n\n\"Qianxing still hasn't woken up?\" As soon as they returned to the villa, everyone was worried about Lu Qianxing's safety. They walked into Lu Qianxing's room together. Seeing the unconscious Lu Qianxing on the bed, Chen Hui looked puzzled.\n\n\"I think we should contact Old Chang and ask him to come and examine Qianxing to see what's going on,\" Zhao Zhen suggested, afraid that something might happen to Lu Qianxing and delay his recovery.\n\n\"Yes, if something is truly wrong, delaying treatment would be problematic.\" Zhang Lan also agreed with Zhao Zhen's suggestion. In fact, if it weren't for the fact that only she and Ye Bin were at the villa, they would have contacted a doctor to examine Lu Qianxing's safety long ago.\n\n\"Alright, I'll contact Old Chang and ask him to come over now to help with the examination.\" Old Xu nodded, agreeing with Zhao Zhen's suggestion, and immediately dialed Chang Hongshan's number. While waiting for Chang Hongshan, they began to discuss their findings for the day.\n\nAfter Old Xu recounted everything to Ye Bin and Zhang Lan without missing a word, both Ye Bin and Zhang Lan's faces darkened, and they fell into a brief period of thought.\n\n\"Two types of DNA? This means the deceased might indeed not be Ding Xiaoqian, but someone else.\" Based on the findings of Old Xu and the others, Zhang Lan felt that it was more likely that the deceased was not Ding Xiaoqian.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, you should have contacted me about the morgue incident. If you had asked Ye He to help, perhaps the morgue door could have been opened.\"\n\nOld Xu was stunned by Ye Bin's words, then patted his forehead with one hand. \"I completely forgot. Your brother is a computer expert.\" Old Xu said with a wry smile, realizing he had forgotten that he had a computer expert nearby.\n\n\"But it's okay. We can investigate again tomorrow morning.\" Ye Bin quickly said, fearing Old Xu would blame himself.\n\n\"Alas, I just hope nothing else goes wrong tomorrow.\"\n\nAs everyone was talking, the doorbell rang outside the villa. Chang Hongshan had arrived. Before he could even exchange a few pleasantries with Old Xu, Old Xu grabbed him and hurried into Lu Qianxing's room.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 137 Disappearance",
    "content": "Chapter 137: Disappearance\n\n\"Old Chang, how is it? Is he okay?\" After Chang Hongshan finished examining Lu Qianxing, Old Xu asked with a face full of worry.\n\n\"There are no major problems, just that his body is a bit weak. He needs more rest, and if we wait a little longer, I think he should wake up.\" Chang Hongshan examined Lu Qianxing very carefully, and only after confirming there were no issues did he make his assessment.\n\n\"Hoo!\" Hearing Chang Hongshan's words, everyone let out a sigh of relief, the heavy stone in their hearts finally lifted.\n\n\"It's good that he's alright. We were just worried something might happen to him,\" Old Xu said, a relieved smile appearing on his face.\n\n\"But speaking of which, this child's body is too weak. It doesn't look like a body that belongs to someone his age.\"\n\n\"Doesn't look like a body that belongs to someone his age? What do you mean?\" Old Xu and the others showed a flicker of confusion, unable to fully comprehend Chang Hongshan's words.\n\n\"Generally speaking, young people have very good physical fitness, their vitality and spirit are very strong. However, when I was examining this child's body, I found that his body, compared to his age, seems to have aged more than double. Simply put, at twenty years old, he has the body of a forty-year-old.\"\n\n\"Old Chang, he doesn't have any hidden illnesses, does he?\" Old Xu asked worriedly, fearing that Lu Qianxing might have some undetectable condition.\n\n\"You can rest assured about that. Apart from his body being weaker than his age suggests, everything else is normal.\"\n\n\"Then, regarding his body, can it be treated?\" Ye Bin, standing beside Old Xu, also asked Chang Hongshan with a worried expression.\n\n\"Weakness in the body, as long as he gets proper care, recovery is not difficult, after all, he is still young. However, if this continues, problems are bound to arise.\"\n\n\"What is the specific reason for his physical weakness?\" Zhang Lan asked, looking at Chang Hongshan.\n\nUpon hearing Zhang Lan's question, Chang Hongshan didn't answer immediately. Instead, his gaze shifted to Lu Qianxing. After a long while, Chang Hongshan slowly said, \"There are quite a few reasons for physical weakness. The most obvious one right now might be that this child is always staying up late.\" Chang Hongshan said, pointing to Lu Qianxing's eyes. Under his eyes, there were very dark eye bags, clearly the result of long-term熬夜 (staying up late).\n\n\"When he wakes up, I'll have to give him a good lecture.\"\n\n\"Speaking of which, Old Xu, what's the result of the investigation into the previous case?\"\n\n\"There was a slight hitch, and we haven't found anything. We'll be heading back to investigate again early tomorrow morning, and then it should be clear.\"\n\nChang Hongshan heard this and didn't ask further, just nodded. \"I'll prescribe him some medicine. You should have him take it for the next few days. If there are any other issues after he wakes up, you can contact me.\" Chang Hongshan said, taking out a pen, pulling out a small notepad from his pocket, tearing off a page, and writing down the medicinal ingredients before handing it to Old Xu.\n\n\"It's getting late, so I won't delay your investigation any further. If you have any problems, feel free to contact me anytime.\" Chang Hongshan said, preparing to leave.\n\nOld Xu didn't try to keep Chang Hongshan, as he didn't want him to be too involved in the case. \"Alright, then I won't see you out. Be careful on your way. Call me when you get back.\"\n\nChang Hongshan nodded, walked to Old Xu's side, and gently patted his shoulder. \"Old Xu, be careful with everything. If there are any problems, remember to contact me. Also, do your best.\" He emphasized the words \"do your best\" by patting Old Xu's shoulder a few times.\n\n\"I understand.\" Old Xu nodded solemnly, then saw Chang Hongshan off.\n\nAfter a sleepless night of waiting, early the next morning, Old Xu contacted a young police officer and went to the police station to investigate again, timing it with the start of the workday.\n\nWhen Old Xu and his group arrived at the police station by car, they saw the young police officer who had been waiting for them. However, compared to before, the young police officer had no trace of a smile on his face; instead, his expression was exceptionally grim, clearly indicating something had happened.\n\n\"Xiao Tian? What's wrong? Your expression looks so bad?\" After getting out of the car and seeing the young police officer approaching with a somber face, Old Xu asked with some confusion.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, something has happened,\" the young police officer said in a deep voice, causing Old Xu and the others to freeze.\n\n\"Something has happened? What do you mean?\" Old Xu frowned, a very bad premonition flashing through his mind.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, please come with me first.\" The young police officer did not answer Old Xu's question but led Old Xu and his group into the police station, heading towards yesterday's morgue.\n\nUpon arriving at the morgue, the morgue door was already open. However, outside the morgue door, many police officers were gathered, each with a heavy expression on their faces.\n\nSeeing the heavy expressions on the faces of these police officers, Old Xu and the others realized that something must have happened inside the morgue.\n\nLooking through the morgue door, Old Xu and his group saw a body bag lying on the floor inside the morgue, and beside the body bag stood several forensic pathologists.\n\n\"What is this? What happened?\" Old Xu looked at the young police officer beside him confusedly and then asked softly.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, sometime around 2 AM last night, the alarm in the police station went off. The police officer on duty heard the alarm and went to the morgue. When he arrived, he saw that the morgue door was open. At first, he didn't dare to go in alone. After contacting a colleague, the two of them, with courage, entered the morgue. But when they entered, they saw the police officer from the accident scene standing on the morgue floor. Then, the two police officers were frightened and turned to run outside. As a result, only one police officer ran out; the other police officer died inside the morgue,\" the young police officer said, pointing to the body bag on the floor inside the morgue.\n\nAfter listening to the young police officer's account, Old Xu and the others' faces turned grim.\n\n\"What about the body from the accident scene? Is it still there?\" Chen Hui asked the young police officer, voicing the matter that concerned him most at the moment.\n\nThe young police officer shook his head. \"After the police officer who ran out contacted us, and we arrived here, we couldn't find the body from the accident scene anymore.\" The young police officer shivered involuntarily as he spoke.\n\n\"How could this happen!\" Zhao Zhen frowned, a terrifying thought flashing through his mind. \"Could that person have turned into a zombie?\" Zhao Zhen's mind flashed with scenes he had seen on television, where a deceased body turned into a zombie and harmed people.\n\n\"Xiao Tian, can you do us a favor? We'd like to investigate the crime scene.\"\n\n\"I can help, but Uncle Xu, the scene inside is too gruesome. I'm afraid you won't be able to handle it.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, I've seen even more gruesome scenes than this,\" Old Xu said calmly, his gaze firm.\n\nSeeing Old Xu's determined gaze, the young police officer didn't say anything further. He nodded and led Old Xu and his group into the morgue.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 138: Suspicion\n\nWith the young policeman's help, Old Xu and his team successfully entered the morgue. As everyone stepped inside, their expressions turned grim.\n\nThe morgue was filled with a putrid stench, and from the body bags on the floor, they could clearly see a corpse that appeared to have been gnawed by something.\n\n\"What happened to this body!\" Zhao Zhen frowned, feeling a surge of nausea as he looked at the body in the bag.\n\n\"We don't know. The body was already like this when we came in,\" the young policeman replied helplessly.\n\n\"Looking at the wounds, it seems like something bit the body,\" Old Xu squatted down, carefully examining the injuries.\n\n\"Does the police station keep dogs?\" Ning Hua asked the young policeman next to him, hearing Old Xu's assessment.\n\n\"No,\" the young policeman replied truthfully.\n\n\"Could it be that the previous corpse turned into a zombie?\" Zhao Zhen's mind went back to scenes from television, where bodies reanimated and bit people.\n\n\"Zombies! No way!\" The young policeman was startled by Zhao Zhen's words, a chill running down his spine.\n\n\"Old Zhao, stop talking nonsense. You can't just spout such things without evidence!\" Old Xu sternly rebuked Zhao Zhen.\n\nZhao Zhen offered an awkward smile, realizing his words had caused everyone present, including the other policemen in the morgue, to turn grim and show a flicker of fear.\n\n\"I was just kidding! Just kidding.\"\n\n\"Xiao Tian, after we left last night, did anything strange happen at the police station?\" Old Xu changed the subject, asking the young policeman.\n\n\"Strange things.\" The young policeman frowned, falling into thought. After a moment, he shook his head. \"Nothing strange, apart from this current case. Nothing else.\"\n\n\"I did encounter something strange,\" an older policeman spoke up, just as the young policeman finished.\n\nHearing this, everyone's gaze shifted to the older policeman.\n\n\"What strange thing?\" Old Xu asked, his voice tinged with urgency.\n\n\"Sometime last night, around 10 PM, it was my shift. I was sitting at the monitoring station playing on my phone. When I glanced up at the monitor, I saw a man dressed all in black loitering outside the station. At first, I thought someone had come to report a crime, but then the man left, and I didn't think much of it. But when the case occurred this morning, I remembered the man from last night and checked the surveillance footage. However, I couldn't find any sign of him from last night.\" The older policeman recalled.\n\n\"Man in black.\" The young policeman merely frowned with a hint of confusion at the older policeman's words. However, upon hearing about the man in black, Old Xu and his team's faces darkened.\n\n\"Old Xu.\" Zhao Zhen looked at Old Xu, about to say something, but was interrupted by a gesture from Old Xu.\n\n\"Did you get a clear look at the man in black?\" Old Xu asked the older policeman.\n\nThe older policeman shook his head slightly. \"No, I couldn't see clearly. If it were daytime, it might have been possible, but at night, with poor lighting, I could only vaguely tell it was a man. As for his features, I couldn't make them out.\" In reality, the older policeman had tried his best to observe the man in black's features but was unable to, only judging from his build that it was a male.\n\nAfter hearing the older policeman's account, Old Xu simply nodded and turned his gaze back to the corpse in the body bag.\n\n\"What's going on! What happened!\" While Old Xu and the others were still investigating the scene, a cold, angry voice echoed from outside the morgue.\n\n\"Oh no, Captain Wang is back!\" The young policeman's face fell the moment he heard the voice from outside the morgue.\n\n\"Is that your superior?\" Old Xu guessed, noticing the young policeman's flustered expression.\n\nThe young policeman nodded quickly. \"Captain Wang has a terrible temper. If he finds out you're here, it'll cause trouble!\" The young policeman gave a wry smile, unsure of what to do.\n\nBefore the young policeman could devise a solution, a burly policeman with a rough face strode into the morgue.\n\n\"Zheng Tian! What's wrong? I heard something happened! What's going on!\" The policeman, known as Captain Wang, first saw the young policeman and then asked coldly. His gaze then shifted to Old Xu and his team. \"Who are these people? Suspects?\"\n\nThe young policeman wore a very awkward smile and quickly explained to Captain Wang, \"Captain Wang, this is Officer Xu Jiang. They're here to help investigate the case.\"\n\n\"Xu Jiang? Officer Xu? Help investigate the case? What? We don't have enough police officers in our station? We have to call the police and ask officers from other stations for help?\" Captain Wang's face instantly darkened upon hearing the young policeman's words, and he immediately began questioning the young policeman.\n\nSeeing the young policeman's predicament, Old Xu smiled and said, \"Are you Captain Wang? My apologies, I'm Xu Jiang. We're currently investigating a case...\" Old Xu's words were cut short by Captain Wang.\n\n\"Investigating a case? What case are you investigating? What kind of case requires investigation at our police station? What? Were you sent by higher-ups to investigate us?\" Captain Wang spoke rudely, not giving Old Xu a chance to speak.\n\n\"Uh, no, we're just investigating a case, and this case, it just so happens to be...\" Before Old Xu could finish, Captain Wang interrupted him again.\n\n\"Show me your identification. I want to see which police station you're from, to be investigating here.\" Captain Wang said, extending his hand and gesturing for Old Xu and the others to produce their credentials.\n\nHearing that they were being asked for their identification right away, Old Xu and the others' faces soured.\n\n\"What? Not police officers? No identification?\" Captain Wang narrowed his eyes and spoke coldly.\n\n\"Captain Wang, Officer Xu and the others have already resigned,\" the young policeman interjected to explain.\n\n\"Resigned? Resigned and still come to our police station to investigate a case? You guys are really dedicated! Should I praise you!\" Captain Wang said sarcastically. \"Speaking of which, investigating cases after resigning, do you have some kind of problem?\"\n\n\"What did you say!\" Zhao Zhen, unable to tolerate the repeated taunts, glared and spoke up.\n\n\"What? Flustered? I now suspect that you all have some serious issues.\" Captain Wang said, a cold smile playing on his lips.\n\n\"You!\" Zhao Zhen gritted his teeth, wanting to say more, but was stopped by Old Xu's hand.\n\n\"Captain Wang, I sincerely apologize for the disturbance.\" Old Xu said, then led his group away.\n\nHowever, before they could take more than a few steps, Captain Wang reached out and blocked them. \"You think you can come and go as you please, like this is your home? With a case happening here, I have reason to believe you are connected to it. Please remain here until you can prove your innocence.\"\n\n\"You!\"\n\nFacing Captain Wang's unreasonable demand, Old Xu simply smiled faintly. \"Alright.\"\n\nThe young policeman, seeing the situation, felt helpless. He wanted to speak up for Old Xu and his team, but Old Xu repeatedly signaled for him not to get involved.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, I'm truly sorry.\" The young policeman pursed his lips, his face filled with apology.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

I think it's not unreasonable to consider you the prime suspects.\" Old Xu didn't want to trouble the young officer and was preparing to leave the police station. However, to his surprise, the young officer's superior didn't seem to intend to let them go and had already identified them as suspects.\n\n\"What the hell! The case happened before we arrived. What basis do you have to say it was caused by our appearance!\" Facing the young officer's superior, Captain Wang's刁难, Zhao Zhen directly cursed.\n\n\"Oh? You say you appeared at the police station after the case occurred. May I ask if you have any evidence?\" Captain Wang spoke coldly, appearing exceptionally calm in response to Zhao Zhen's scolding.\n\n\"The officers present can all testify for us! We only arrived here a short while ago.\" Zhao Zhen said, glancing at the surrounding officers.\n\n\"Which of you can testify for them?\" Captain Wang spoke coldly, his gaze sweeping over the surrounding officers.\n\nFacing Captain Wang's threatening gaze, all the officers remained silent at that moment.\n\n\"You!\" Seeing this, Zhao Zhen trembled with anger and cursed Captain Wang's entire family in his mind.\n\n\"Without evidence to prove your innocence, I naturally have reason to keep you here for questioning, don't I?\" Captain Wang said, a smug smile crossing his face.\n\nJust as Captain Wang was beaming with pride, Old Xu calmly spoke, \"Captain Wang, may I make a phone call?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\" Captain Wang spoke coldly, a mocking look flashing across his face.\n\n\"Thank you.\" Old Xu replied calmly, then took out his phone and dialed Lin Xiao's number.\n\n\"Hello, is this Detective Lin?\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Lin Xiao's calm voice came from the other end of the line.\n\n\"Detective Lin, we've run into some trouble here and would like to ask for your help.\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\" Lin Xiao said calmly, and Old Xu then briefly explained the situation.\n\nAs Old Xu recounted the events, Captain Wang stood with his arms crossed, looking at Old Xu with disdain, seemingly unconcerned about Old Xu's capabilities.\n\nThe young officer stood beside Captain Wang, feeling somewhat worried. Others might not know, but the young officer understood why Captain Wang appeared so at ease. It was because Captain Wang's brother-in-law was a high-ranking official in X City and held considerable influence there. This was what made Captain Wang so arrogant and dismissive of everyone in the police station.\n\n\"Captain Wang, Detective Lin wants to speak with you.\" As instructed by Lin Xiao, Old Xu handed the phone to Captain Wang.\n\n\"What a big ego. If he has something to say, let him come to the police station and say it.\" Captain Wang spoke coldly, his words full of disdain.\n\n\"Don't you regret it?\" Old Xu said calmly, a cold smile appearing on his face.\n\nSeeing the smile on Old Xu's face, Captain Wang felt a twinge of unease, but as soon as he thought of his brother-in-law's status in X City, he became reckless. \"Regret? Hmph, are you kidding me? Who do you think you are?\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Facing Captain Wang's recklessness, Old Xu said nothing more. After a brief chat with Lin Xiao on the phone, he hung up.\n\nSeeing Old Xu hang up, Captain Wang assumed he had run out of options, and his disdain became even more pronounced. \"What? Not calling anymore? Make a few more calls, I'd like to see how powerful you really are.\" Just as Captain Wang was mocking Old Xu and his group, his phone suddenly rang.\n\nCaptain Wang snorted at Old Xu and his group as he took out his phone. Upon seeing the caller ID was his brother-in-law, Captain Wang felt a flicker of confusion, but he quickly brushed it aside and answered the call.\n\n\"Hello, where are you?\" Captain Wang's brother-in-law's icy question came from the other end of the line.\n\nHearing his brother-in-law's interrogation, Captain Wang was taken aback for a moment, but then he smiled and said without much thought, \"Oh, it's brother-in-law. What's up? I'm at the police station. Is something wrong?\"\n\n\"You're at the police station? Is there a police officer named Xu Jiang there?\"\n\n\"Xu Jiang.\" Hearing his brother-in-law's words, Captain Wang was a bit stunned, then he looked at Old Xu beside him with confusion. \"Yes, there is. Brother-in-law, what's wrong? Do you know him?\" At this moment, Captain Wang already sensed that something was amiss. Judging by his brother-in-law's words, he could tell that his brother-in-law seemed to know the Old Xu in front of him.\n\n\"I don't know him.\" Captain Wang's brother-in-law answered directly without thinking.\n\nHearing that his brother-in-law didn't know the person, Captain Wang finally breathed a sigh of relief and his triumphant smile reappeared.\n\nHowever, before Captain Wang's triumphant smile had fully formed, his brother-in-law's next sentence left him frozen in place.\n\n\"From now on, you are to cooperate with that Xu Jiang in the investigation.\"\n\n\"Cooperate with Xu Jiang in the investigation!\" Captain Wang repeated his brother-in-law's words, thinking he had misheard.\n\n\"That's right, cooperate with Xu Jiang in the investigation. If you have any problems, contact me anytime.\" Captain Wang's brother-in-law confirmed again.\n\n\"Brother-in-law, this person isn't even a police officer! Why should I cooperate with him in the investigation?\" Captain Wang asked in confusion, his mind full of questions.\n\n\"Don't worry if he's a police officer or not. In short, from now on, you must cooperate with him in the investigation. Remember! Do not offend him.\" After saying the last sentence, before Captain Wang could snap out of his daze, his brother-in-law hung up.\n\n\"Beep, beep...\" Listening to the busy signal on his phone, Captain Wang frowned, his expression growing extremely grim.\n\n\"Captain Wang, you should have heard what your brother-in-law said. Let's begin.\" Seeing the previously arrogant and overbearing Captain Wang being disciplined by his own brother-in-law, Old Xu spoke calmly, but felt a surge of satisfaction within him.\n\n\"Haha! Why aren't you so arrogant now! Weren't you showing off just now!\" Although Old Xu didn't mock him, Zhao Zhen was laughing heartily at this moment.\n\n\"Old Zhao, that's enough. We still have things to do.\" Old Xu, fearing Zhao Zhen would anger Captain Wang, quickly intervened.\n\n\"Hmph.\" Hearing Old Xu's restraint, Zhao Zhen also knew to hold back. He snorted at Captain Wang and continued to investigate the crime scene with Old Xu and his group.\n\nWatching Old Xu and his group nonchalantly investigate the crime scene, Captain Wang harbored a sense of resentment. \"Zheng Tian, keep an eye on them! If anything goes wrong, I'll hold you responsible!\" Finally, Captain Wang took out his anger on the young officer beside him.\n\n\"Yes.\" The young officer gave an awkward smile and didn't say anything further.\n\nIn the end, Captain Wang left the police station in disgrace, while Old Xu and his group, with the help of the young officer, continued to investigate the crime scene.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 140: Lisa\n\nAfter days of fruitless investigation, Lin Xiao drove alone to a quiet bar. He sat in a corner, ordered a bottle of wine, and drank in solitude.\n\nHe drank glass after glass, bottle after bottle, until he felt a bit dizzy and finally stopped.\n\n\"Isn't it boring to drink here alone?\" In a daze, Lin Xiao heard a gentle voice. He turned his head and found a woman in a business suit standing beside him. She held a glass of red wine and was smiling at him.\n\nLin Xiao glanced at the woman in the business suit, then turned away, continuing to drink his melancholy brew alone.\n\n\"You're the first man to ignore me after I've made the first move,\" the woman said, not angered by Lin Xiao's disregard. Instead, she smiled with interest. She then sat down beside Lin Xiao, holding her red wine and crossing her legs.\n\nLin Xiao continued to ignore her words, picking up his wine glass and taking another drink.\n\n\"Am I not beautiful enough?\" the woman asked calmly, a seductive smile on her face.\n\n\"You're annoying. If you have nothing else to do, don't disturb my drinking,\" Lin Xiao said, placing his glass on the table after finishing his drink. He looked at the woman beside him with cold eyes and spoke sternly.\n\n\"Shall we be friends?\" the woman replied with a smile, unfazed by Lin Xiao's words.\n\n\"I don't like making friends,\" Lin Xiao said coldly, a hint of chill in his gaze.\n\n\"You're the first man to refuse me after I've offered to be friends,\" the woman continued to smile.\n\n\"You're the most shameless woman I've ever met,\" Lin Xiao replied coldly, his words filled with hostility.\n\n\"My name is Lisa,\" the woman said, as if she hadn't heard Lin Xiao's words.\n\n\"You're the most annoying woman I've ever met,\" Lin Xiao said coldly. He then picked up the wine bottle, refilled his glass, and chose to ignore the woman beside him, continuing to drink alone.\n\n\"I heard you're investigating the 'Ghost Bus' case.\" The woman's next sentence made Lin Xiao's brows twitch slightly, a flicker of doubt appearing in his mind. However, Lin Xiao showed no outward sign of this and continued to drink.\n\n\"Even though you're pretending to be calm, your face is full of doubt,\" the woman said, placing her glass of red wine in front of Lin Xiao with a teasing smile.\n\n\"Do you think you've got me cornered?\" Lin Xiao asked, finishing his drink and placing his glass on the table. He turned his gaze to the woman beside him, staring at her coldly.\n\n\"I know a bit about the 'Ghost Bus' incident. I wonder if Detective Lin is interested.\"\n\n\"No,\" Lin Xiao answered curtly, without any hesitation.\n\n\"Detective Lin doesn't need to answer right away. This is my business card. If Detective Lin is interested, you can contact me anytime.\" The woman said this and took out a business card from her handbag.\n\n\"Reporter, Lisa.\"\n\nAfter placing the business card down, the woman didn't say anything more. She picked up her glass of red wine from the table, gave Lin Xiao a flirtatious wink, and turned to leave.\n\nLin Xiao watched the departing woman with cold eyes, remaining silent. Once her figure disappeared from his sight, Lin Xiao picked up the wine bottle, refilled his glass, and resumed drinking alone.\n\nLate into the night, Lin Xiao left the bar. Since he had been drinking, he couldn't drive. So, he walked along the street, looking for a passing taxi.\n\nHe walked along the roadside for nearly half an hour. Perhaps it was because it was late, or because the area he was in was quite remote, but Lin Xiao hadn't seen a single taxi.\n\n\"Beep! Beep!\"\n\nJust as Lin Xiao was wondering why there were no taxis on the street, a red sports car flashed its high beams and stopped beside him.\n\nLin Xiao frowned, his eyes flickered, and he already guessed what was happening. The person in the red sports car that stopped beside him was none other than the woman he had met in the bar earlier.\n\nThe window of the red sports car rolled down, and the woman, wearing sunglasses, poked her head out and smiled at Lin Xiao. \"Detective Lin, what a coincidence, running into you again.\"\n\n\"Driving under the influence will get your license revoked. I believe you know that,\" Lin Xiao said coldly, his eyes fixed on the woman in the sports car.\n\n\"Haha, I knew Detective Lin would say that. This is a breathalyzer.\" The woman held a \"breathalyzer\" in her hand, blew into it, and then showed the display screen to Lin Xiao. \"Here, Detective Lin, look. My blood alcohol content is not over the limit. I wasn't drink-driving.\" The woman said, a smug smile on her face.\n\nLin Xiao's face was grim, and he stared coldly at the woman. Then, Lin Xiao turned around and continued walking along the roadside.\n\n\"Detective Lin, it's so late, and I don't think there are any more taxis. Why don't you get in? I'll give you a ride for free, how about it?\" The woman said, her hand on the steering wheel and the other resting on the car window, smiling at Lin Xiao.\n\nLin Xiao continued to ignore her words, simply continuing to walk along the roadside.\n\n\"Detective Lin, it's quite a distance from here back to your place. It's so late now, if you encounter anything… unclean, it's a bit chilling, don't you think?\" The woman said, deliberately shivering.\n\n\"If you keep following me, I can accuse you of obstructing official business.\" Lin Xiao was getting a bit angry at the woman's persistent trailing, so he stopped walking, turned around, and looked at the woman in the sports car beside him.\n\n\"Haha, Detective Lin looks quite handsome when he's angry. Obstruction of official business, that's quite a charge, but unfortunately, I'm not obstructing Detective Lin. I just admire Detective Lin and want to chat with him for a bit.\" The woman said with a smile, showing no change in her demeanor despite Lin Xiao's threat.\n\nLin Xiao's face was grim, and he stared coldly at the woman. After a long pause, Lin Xiao turned around and walked in the opposite direction.\n\nThe moment she saw Lin Xiao turn, the woman turned the steering wheel and executed a clean 360-degree drift, spinning the car in place.\n\nSeeing that the woman had no intention of letting him go, Lin Xiao simply stopped moving forward. He stopped at a stone bench by the roadside and sat down.\n\nSeeing Lin Xiao sit on the stone bench by the roadside, the woman turned off the sports car, got out, and then sat beside Lin Xiao. \"Why aren't you walking anymore, Detective Lin? Aren't you supposed to continue investigating the case tomorrow? Why are you sitting here now? Could it be that Detective Lin has given up?\"\n\n\"You are really annoying,\" Lin Xiao said frowning coldly. Facing the \"annoying\" woman beside him, Lin Xiao felt a sense of helplessness at this moment.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

However, to his surprise, the station doors were already open when he got there.\n\n\"Mm.\" Lin Xiao sat at his desk, his gaze fixed on the computer screen. He simply nodded in response to Shen Hua's greeting.\n\n\"Captain Lin, did you come back last night?\" Although Shen Hua remembered Lin Xiao leaving the station alone last night, seeing Lin Xiao so engrossed in his investigation early in the morning, he guessed that Lin Xiao might have returned. After all, Lin Xiao had been practically living at the station these past few days.\n\nLin Xiao ignored Shen Hua's question, his attention entirely on the computer screen, his hands constantly typing on the keyboard and moving the mouse.\n\n\"Sigh.\" Shen Hua sighed, no longer surprised by Lin Xiao's behavior.\n\n\"Captain Lin, I brought some pastries from home. You must not have eaten breakfast yet. I'll leave them on your desk. Please take a break and eat something later.\" Shen Hua said as he walked over to Lin Xiao and placed the pastries on his desk.\n\nFrom beginning to end, besides Shen Hua's initial greeting, which Lin Xiao had responded to, Lin Xiao's eyes remained glued to the computer screen for the next two hours, his hands busy with the keyboard and mouse. He hadn't had a moment to spare to acknowledge Shen Hua.\n\nAs time passed, other police officers at the station also arrived and got to work.\n\n\"Brother Hua, you're here so early. Where's Captain Lin? I saw him leave alone last night. Has he returned?\" A colleague of Shen Hua asked curiously upon seeing him. He hadn't seen Lin Xiao since arriving at the station himself, and since Lin Xiao had left so late the previous night, he assumed Lin Xiao hadn't returned yet.\n\n\"Captain Lin is in his office.\"\n\n\"His office? Didn't Captain Lin go out last night? Did he come back later?\" Shen Hua's colleague asked, a little surprised.\n\nShen Hua nodded. \"Presumably. Captain Lin is very busy right now. Is there something you need?\"\n\n\"No! No!\" Shen Hua's colleague quickly waved his hands. \"I was just curious. But speaking of which, Captain Lin is truly dedicated. Ever since he joined our station, I've never seen him idle. He's always swamped with work.\"\n\n\"Captain Lin is anxious to clear up the case,\" Shen Hua said with a hint of emotion.\n\n\"You know, Brother Hua, I heard from everyone that the case we're investigating this time isn't believed to be man-made?\" Shen Hua's colleague leaned in and whispered to Shen Hua, asking.\n\n\"Who told you that?\" Shen Hua's expression immediately darkened at the question.\n\n\"Who else? Everyone! And it's not just us; the case is being talked about wildly online. Apparently, someone has already found out that it's 'caused by evil spirits.' I wonder if it's true.\"\n\n\"Alright, stop talking nonsense. Hurry up and get to work. Where are there so many 'evil spirits'? Do you believe the rumors online?\" Shen Hua said, rolling his eyes at his colleague.\n\n\"Brother Hua, Captain Lin seems to value you highly, and you're always by his side. Have you found out anything?\" Shen Hua's colleague wasn't letting up and continued to press.\n\n\"Find out what! The case is still under investigation. If Captain Lin had any findings, he would definitely inform us immediately. Stop worrying and do your job.\" After saying this, Shen Hua sent his colleague away and returned to his own office to start investigating the case according to the tasks Lin Xiao had left him.\n\n\"Brother Hua! Brother Hua!\" Shen Hua had barely sat down when he heard anxious shouts from outside.\n\nHearing the shouts, Shen Hua hurried out of his office. As soon as he stepped out, he saw his colleague running towards him with a worried expression.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Seeing his colleague's anxious look, Shen Hua frowned slightly, wondering if another case had occurred.\n\n\"Brother Hua, there's a beautiful woman outside the station! She's so pretty!\" Shen Hua's colleague said, catching his breath.\n\n\"...\" Hearing his colleague's words, Shen Hua's expression immediately sank. \"At a time like this, you're still thinking about beautiful women!\"\n\n\"No, no! That beautiful woman is looking for Captain Lin. She said she's Captain Lin's 'wife'.\"\n\nHearing the word \"wife\"¹, Shen Hua was taken aback. As far as he knew, Lin Xiao didn't have a girlfriend, but now someone claiming to be his \"wife\" had appeared. This made Shen Hua very curious about who this so-called \"wife\" of Lin Xiao could be.\n\n\"I'll go find Captain Lin. Wait for me here.\" Lin Xiao had previously asked Shen Hua to help inform the other officers not to disturb him unless it was urgent. If anything came up, they were to contact him through Shen Hua. That's why Shen Hua's colleague hadn't gone to find Lin Xiao directly.\n\nShen Hua gently pushed open the door to Lin Xiao's office, knocked softly, and then tentatively called out, \"Captain Lin, Captain Lin.\"\n\n\"What is it? Is there something?\" Lin Xiao asked calmly, but his gaze never left the computer screen.\n\n\"Captain Lin, someone is looking for you outside. She said she's your 'wife'.\" Shen Hua said in a low voice.\n\nHearing the word \"wife\"¹, Lin Xiao's gaze sharpened slightly. He then turned his head to look at Shen Hua. \"Please tell her that I'm not at the station,\" Lin Xiao said coldly, before turning his gaze back to the computer screen.\n\nHearing Lin Xiao's words, Shen Hua didn't think much of it. \"Okay,\" he replied, then gently closed the door to Lin Xiao's office.\n\nJust as Shen Hua was about to go outside to see this so-called \"wife\" of Lin Xiao.\n\nA commotion erupted outside the police station, and then a woman in formal attire appeared before Shen Hua.\n\nThe moment Shen Hua saw the woman in formal attire, he was momentarily stunned, captivated by her beauty.\n\n\"Miss, this is a police station. You can't just barge in,\" several officers were trying to persuade the woman behind her.\n\n\"Hello, handsome, do you know where Lin Xiao is?\" The woman flashed Shen Hua a sweet smile and asked gently.\n\nShen Hua was momentarily dazed and, without thinking, blurted out, \"Go to the end, turn left, it's the second office.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" The woman gave Shen Hua another sweet smile and then walked past him.\n\n\"Oh no!\" As the woman brushed past him, Shen Hua suddenly snapped back to reality and wanted to stop her. But it was too late; the woman had already reached the end, turned left, and disappeared from his sight.\n\n\"Hey! Captain Lin isn't at the station today!\" Shen Hua hurriedly rushed forward, but it was too late. The woman had already opened the door to Lin Xiao's office.\n\n\"It's over!\" Seeing this, Shen Hua smacked his forehead, a look of despair crossing his face.\n\n(End of Chapter)\n\n---\n¹ \"內人\" (nèi rén) can mean \"wife\" or \"my wife\" in a more formal or slightly old-fashioned way.

He stood frozen in place, his face filled with despair.\n\n\"Detective Lin, long time no see.\" Opening the office door, the woman revealed a very alluring smile upon seeing Lin Xiao.\n\nLin Xiao looked up, his gaze coldly fixed on the woman, his expression somewhat grave.\n\n\"Detective Lin doesn't look well. Did you stay up late last night?\" the woman asked with a smile, a hint of teasing crossing her face.\n\n\"Captain Lin, I'm sorry! I'm truly sorry! I couldn't stop her.\" As soon as the woman finished speaking, Shen Hua rushed into Lin Xiao's office, apologizing to Lin Xiao as he blocked the woman. \"Miss, I'm truly sorry, Captain Lin has urgent matters to attend to. Please leave and don't disturb him.\"\n\nFacing Shen Hua's obstruction, the woman chose to ignore him, directing her gaze to Lin Xiao behind Shen Hua. \"Detective Lin, I just arrived, and you're already asking me to leave. How should we settle last night's tab?\" the woman said, a seductive smile playing on her lips.\n\n\"Last night's tab.\" Hearing the woman's words, and recalling Lin Xiao's departure from the police station the previous night, Shen Hua instantly connected the dots.\n\n\"You can go out first. If I need anything, I'll contact you later.\" Lin Xiao stood up, walked to Shen Hua's side, and said softly.\n\n\"Ah? Oh!\" Shen Hua was taken aback for a moment, then without further thought, turned and left Lin Xiao's office. After leaving, Shen Hua did not forget to close the office door.\n\n\"Detective Lin is indeed impressive. He commands such respect even from those older than him,\" the woman said with a smile after Shen Hua left.\n\n\"If you have something to say, say it quickly. I don't have time to chat with you,\" Lin Xiao said coldly, his gaze still fixed on the woman.\n\n\"I want to be your assistant,\" the woman stated her purpose for coming directly.\n\n\"I don't need one,\" Lin Xiao rejected her request without a second thought.\n\n\"Detective Lin is still so impatient. I don't need you to give me an answer right away.\"\n\n\"I have a good assistant. I don't need anyone else to be my assistant,\" Lin Xiao stated coldly, his attitude unwavering.\n\n\"Is it that police officer from just now? From my observation, that officer seems a bit untrustworthy,\" the woman said with a smile, feigning concern.\n\n\"It's enough that he's more trustworthy than you,\" Lin Xiao retorted sharply, matching the woman's words.\n\n\"Detective Lin saying that is truly heartbreaking,\" the woman sighed dramatically, a flicker of disappointment on her face.\n\n\"If you're heartbroken, then leave. Staying here is just annoying,\" Lin Xiao said, turning and sitting back down at his desk.\n\n\"Aren't you afraid I'll regret it if I leave? After all, I've brought you some heavy news.\"\n\n\"Not interested,\" Lin Xiao replied coldly, showing no interest in the 'heavy news' the woman claimed to have.\n\n\"Detective Lin, I know you've been looking for someone named 'Li Chao'. It's quite a coincidence, but I know where this person is,\" the woman said, carefully observing Lin Xiao's expression.\n\nUpon hearing the name \"Li Chao,\" Lin Xiao was indeed surprised, but he did not show it. He stared at the computer screen on his desk, his expression indifferent.\n\n\"As expected of Detective Lin. You have doubts in your heart, but you're pretending not to care,\" although Lin Xiao appeared indifferent and uninterested in the woman's news, she knew he was merely trying to maintain composure.\n\nFacing the woman who seemed to see through everything, Lin Xiao frowned slightly. He had lost to her before, and he never expected to be defeated by her again.\n\n\"Detective Lin, I think you should be more honest. Lying to a woman is not a wise move, you know. After all, we women are natural-born 'detectives.' Just by looking at your eyes, I can tell if you're lying,\" the woman said with a playful smile.\n\nHearing her words, a hint of helplessness crossed Lin Xiao's face. He had never lost to anyone before, but when facing this woman, he felt he had no chance of winning. She seemed to possess a pair of insightful eyes that could penetrate all things; nothing could escape her observation.\n\n\"Where is Li Chao?\" Since he couldn't deceive her, Lin Xiao decided not to hide anything and directly asked.\n\n\"Detective Lin hasn't answered my question yet. I want to be your assistant. How about it? Can I?\" the woman asked, a triumphant smile on her face.\n\n\"If you're unwilling to say, I won't force you,\" Lin Xiao stated coldly, refusing to yield to her threat.\n\n\"Hahaha! Detective Lin is indeed someone I have my eye on. Truly extraordinary,\" the woman laughed, her words expressing admiration for Lin Xiao.\n\n\"Where is Li Chao? I'm asking for the last time. If you're unwilling to say, then please leave and don't obstruct my investigation, otherwise, I can accuse you of obstructing official business.\" This time, it was Lin Xiao's turn to threaten the woman.\n\nFacing Lin Xiao's threat, the woman merely smiled slightly, then took out a photograph from her handbag. \"This is my gift to Detective Lin,\" she said, handing the photo to Lin Xiao.\n\nLooking at the photo on the desk, Lin Xiao's expression instantly darkened.\n\nThe photo showed a person, none other than the missing Li Chao, whom he had been searching for. Behind Li Chao was a \"rusty\" bus.\n\n\"Where did you get this photo?\" Lin Xiao asked, his face grim, his gaze fixed on the woman.\n\n\"I'm a reporter. Of course, I took this photo myself,\" the woman replied unhurriedly, seemingly enjoying drawing out the suspense.\n\n\"Have you seen that bus?\" Lin Xiao asked coldly, his eyes locked on the woman.\n\n\"Since I took the photo, naturally, I've seen the bus,\" the woman said with a calm smile.\n\n\"Where is that bus now?\"\n\n\"I seem to recall it was at an abandoned factory,\" the woman said, feigning thoughtfulness.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Lin Xiao's eyes narrowed, a flicker of caution on his face. In fact, after their first meeting, Lin Xiao had immediately begun investigating the woman's identity upon returning to the police station. However, all he found were basic details: her name was \"Lisa,\" and she was an overseas student who had returned. He found no other information about her.\n\n\"Didn't I already tell Detective Lin? My name is Lisa, and I'm a reporter.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 143: Defeat the factory",
    "content": "Chapter 143: The Abandoned Factory\n\nAfter learning a clue about Li Chao from Lisa, Lin Xiao drove with Lisa to the abandoned factory Lisa mentioned.\n\nThe abandoned factory was located in a very remote area on the outskirts of X City, surrounded by mountains. Only a secluded small path to the north allowed passage. However, due to the factory being abandoned for a long time, the path that was once used for passage was now overgrown with weeds.\n\n\"Is that the abandoned factory you were talking about up ahead?\" Lin Xiao asked, looking at the path covered by weeds.\n\n\"After passing through this path and walking for about ten minutes inside, you'll see the abandoned factory,\" Lisa said with a smile.\n\n\"I'm truly impressed that you could find such a remote place,\" Lin Xiao said coldly, a hint of suspicion mixed in his words.\n\n\"Detective Lin, don't forget, I'm a journalist. As a journalist, it's in our nature to dig up some 'unknown' news!\" Lisa replied calmly, appearing unfazed by Lin Xiao's suspicion.\n\n\"With your abilities, I think you've long surpassed the journalist profession,\" Lin Xiao stated coldly, his suspicion not diminishing but rather increasing.\n\n\"Haha, Detective Lin truly overestimates me. However, now is not the time for chatting. If it gets dark, it will be very dangerous here.\" Finally, Lisa used the excuse of darkness to successfully change the subject.\n\nLin Xiao didn't continue to argue with Lisa. He knew very well that the most important thing now was to clarify whether what Lisa said was true.\n\nAfter pushing through the dense weeds, Lin Xiao and Lisa walked for about half an hour before they finally saw the abandoned factory.\n\nThe abandoned factory was not large, it was a small factory. The entire factory was surrounded by a fence, with only the main entrance marked by two stone pillars on either side, supporting a large iron gate in the center.\n\n\"Where is the bus you mentioned?\" Looking inside along the fence, Lin Xiao did not see the bus Lisa had spoken of earlier.\n\nLisa did not answer Lin Xiao's question. Instead, she took out her phone from her pocket and opened the screen to check the time.\n\n\"It's not time yet, we still have to wait a bit. But we can go in and investigate now,\" Lisa said, putting her phone back in her pocket, and then walked towards the left side of the fence of the abandoned factory.\n\nLin Xiao followed closely behind Lisa, not saying anything.\n\n\"We're here. I remember there's a hole here.\" On the left side of the abandoned factory, there was a hole. The hole was not large, but it was just big enough for a person to crawl through.\n\nSeeing the hole in the fence, Lin Xiao didn't think twice. He immediately got down on his hands and knees, crawled through the hole, and entered the abandoned factory.\n\nOutside the fence, seeing Lin Xiao crawl through the hole, Lisa had a very amused smile on her face.\n\n\"Hahaha! Detective Lin looks so dashing!\" Lisa said, covering her mouth with her hand as she laughed.\n\nLin Xiao's face darkened. He ignored Lisa and walked straight into the abandoned factory.\n\n\"Detective Lin, wait for me!\" Seeing Lin Xiao leaving, Lisa called out, then walked several meters further along the left side of the fence and entered through a hole large enough for a person to stand and pass through.\n\nWhen Lin Xiao saw Lisa enter standing up, his expression instantly became extremely grim, and he stared at Lisa with a menacing gaze.\n\n\"Oh my, Detective Lin, don't stare at me like that. I'm a little scared,\" Lisa said, deliberately putting on a scared expression.\n\n\"You are really annoying,\" Lin Xiao said coldly, his voice extremely icy.\n\n\"Detective Lin, you can't blame me for this! I just told you there was a hole there, I didn't tell you to go through it. Besides, Detective Lin was too fast, I didn't even have time to react before you went in,\" Lisa said, shrugging helplessly.\n\n\"...\" Lin Xiao's face darkened. A surge of anger rose within him. If the other person were not a woman, Lin Xiao would have loved to punch her to the ground right then and there.\n\n\"Detective Lin, our time is pressing. Let's get going!\" Seeing Lin Xiao's menacing gaze and gloomy expression, Lisa chose to cut her losses and stopped teasing him.\n\nAfter entering the abandoned factory, Lin Xiao and Lisa first went into a warehouse inside the factory. In this warehouse, there were rusty discarded machines everywhere and several iron barrels lying on the ground emitting a foul odor.\n\n\"This factory is said to have been the largest chemical plant in X City. However, due to an accident, an explosion occurred at the chemical plant, which caused this chemical plant to be abandoned. Moreover, it is said that more than a hundred people died in that explosion accident.\" Lisa was very familiar with the background of the abandoned factory.\n\n\"The accident five years ago?\" Hearing Lisa's description, Lin Xiao also recalled something. Five years ago, a major accident occurred in X City, a chemical plant explosion that resulted in the deaths of nearly a hundred people. That accident became a major news focus at the time, and it took a long time for the situation to gradually calm down.\n\nAt that time, Lin Xiao remembered that the cause of the accident was an explosion caused by old factory facilities and a short circuit.\n\n\"It seems Detective Lin also remembers the major accident five years ago,\" Lisa said with a smile, not surprised that Lin Xiao knew about the factory.\n\n\"After the accident, the factory was demolished. So, this must be the remnants left after the factory was demolished,\" Lin Xiao said, his gaze sweeping around as he looked at the surrounding rusty machinery and made his judgment.\n\n\"Detective Lin is correct, but how much do you know about what happened after the factory was demolished?\"\n\n\"What happened after the factory was demolished?\" Hearing Lisa's words, Lin Xiao frowned slightly. In fact, he hadn't paid attention to what happened after the factory was demolished.\n\n\"After the accident, the factory was completely demolished. However, when the demolition work was nearing completion, supernatural events occurred in the factory. It is said that nearly ten workers responsible for demolishing the factory mysteriously disappeared at that time, so the demolition work was stopped, and that's why these things we see now were left behind.\"\n\nAfter listening to Lisa, Lin Xiao began to observe carefully. Looking at the scattered iron barrels and several rusty machines, Lin Xiao also noticed that some machines were only rusty and not completely damaged. They should have been recycled during the factory demolition, but now they were left behind. All of this was indeed consistent with what Lisa had said.\n\n\"What kind of supernatural event?\" Since Lisa mentioned supernatural events, Lin Xiao believed she must know something.\n\n\"What? Detective Lin doesn't know?\" Lisa said with a smile, deliberately putting on an expression of surprise.\n\n\"...\" Facing Lisa's feigned ignorance, Lin Xiao's expression instantly sank.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

You know the real reason for the accident five years ago?\" Lin Xiao asked coldly, turning his gaze to Lisa.\n\n\"Judging by what Detective Lin said, does Detective Lin also know the real reason for the accident back then?\" Lisa did not answer Lin Xiao's question but probed him.\n\n\"You don't need to hide anything from me. I do know the real reason for the accident five years ago. What I don't know is what happened after the factory was demolished,\" Lin Xiao replied, not choosing to conceal anything. He also knew that concealing information from this woman would be useless.\n\n\"Haha.\" Lisa smiled slightly and then said somewhat triumphantly, \"I didn't expect there to be anything in this world that Detective Lin doesn't know.\"\n\n\"If I knew everything in this world, I wouldn't be a detective, but an immortal,\" Lin Xiao said coldly, appearing very calm in response to Lisa's words.\n\n\"Alright, since I am Detective Lin's assistant, I should naturally help when Detective Lin needs it. Since Detective Lin knows the truth about the factory accident five years ago, I won't say more. I'll talk about the demolition of the factory,\" Lisa said, while also observing Lin Xiao's reaction.\n\nAt this moment, Lin Xiao's expression was very calm, as if nothing Lisa said could move him.\n\nFacing the composed Lin Xiao, Lisa did not continue to keep him in suspense and began to talk about the demolition of the factory.\n\n\"Five years ago, after the accident at the factory here, someone ordered the complete demolition of the factory, followed by the complete sealing of the site, and it was forbidden to build a factory there ever again. But just as the demolition was nearing completion, a strange incident occurred in the factory,\" Lisa said, then looked at Lin Xiao, seemingly very interested in his reaction to her story.\n\nLin Xiao watched Lisa with a blank expression, showing no reaction to what Lisa was saying, simply listening calmly.\n\n\"Detective Lin is indeed extraordinary. Just this composure alone is enough to make one admire you,\" Lisa said with a smile and an appreciative tone.\n\n\"We don't have much time. I hope you can get to the point and not say anything superfluous,\" Lin Xiao said coldly, reminding Lisa.\n\nHearing this, Lisa smiled slightly and said no more, but returned to the main topic and began to talk about the factory.\n\n\"There were two groups of people sent to demolish the factory, each with thirteen people, a total of twenty-six. At that time, these two groups, in order to meet the deadline and demolish all the facilities in the factory as quickly as possible, worked in shifts day and night. Sometimes, to speed up the progress, both groups chose not to rest, working overtime day and night. This continued for nearly a week. In the beginning, nothing happened in the factory. It wasn't until the second week of demolition work that one night, two workers were carrying out the work of dismantling and recycling waste materials at the source of the factory explosion. They heard someone speaking. At first, these two employees thought that another group of people had also come to carry out demolition work there. However, the next morning, when the two groups met, the two employees from the previous night told the other group about what happened last night, but the other group denied going to the source of the explosion for demolition and recycling work last night.\" At this point, Lisa glanced at Lin Xiao again, but Lin Xiao still maintained his indifferent expression.\n\n\"Then, that night, when it was the other group's turn to be on duty, while carrying out dismantling and recycling work, the other group also heard voices at the source of the explosion. Thinking about what the other group had mentioned that morning, a thread of curiosity arose in their hearts. Driven by curiosity, the two entered the source of the explosion.\" Lisa paused here and continued.\n\n\"Due to the severity of the explosion, the source of the explosion was a mess, with traces of the explosion everywhere. Moreover, as the source of the explosion was the most densely populated area for factory employees at the time, although all the bodies had been recovered, a scorched smell could still be detected at the explosion site.\" Lisa spoke with a slower pace and a lowered tone, as if telling a ghost story.\n\nLin Xiao's gaze was indifferent, showing no change in his expression towards Lisa's actions.\n\n\"Haha, 'Even if Mount Tai collapses before him, his expression will not change; even if a startled elk runs past his left, his eyes will not blink.' Detective Lin truly has remarkable composure.\" Facing the real supernatural event she was narrating, Lisa believed that very few people could remain as calm as Lin Xiao, and this calmness was from the inside out.\n\n\"We're running out of time. I hope you can speak faster,\" Lin Xiao said coldly.\n\n\"After the two employees entered the source of the explosion, apart from the mess and smoke, they saw nothing. However, just as they were about to leave, guess what they saw?\" Lisa asked, smiling as she looked at Lin Xiao.\n\n\"I'm not interested. If you don't want to say it, then don't,\" Lin Xiao replied calmly, preparing to stop listening to Lisa's narration and instead go to the source of the factory explosion himself to investigate.\n\n\"Detective Lin, I don't know what dangers you might encounter if you go further. Also, it's getting late. If you continue, you might run into some danger,\" Lisa said with a smile, feigning concern for Lin Xiao's safety.\n\n\"You didn't bring me all this way just to listen to ghost stories, did you?\" Lin Xiao said with a grim expression, turning his cold gaze to Lisa.\n\n\"As the two employees were leaving, they saw a little girl in a black dress waving at them. Upon seeing this, the two employees fled the scene in a panic and told the other employees what they had seen. At first, everyone thought they were hallucinating. Until the third night, the bodies of those two employees were found outside the tent they had set up,\" Lisa said, revealing a somewhat chilling smile.\n\n\"A little girl in a black dress.\" When Lin Xiao heard these words, his expression changed for the first time. These words instantly brought back a memory of what he had seen in Blackwater Village.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 145: Interconnected\n\nWith Lin Xiao's help, Old Xu and his team successfully obtained permission to investigate the case. With the assistance of the young policeman Zheng Tian, Old Xu and his team began a comprehensive investigation at the police station.\n\n\"How is it? Are the surveillance results out? Any findings?\" Earlier, Old Xu had asked Zheng Tian to help investigate the surveillance around the police station, hoping to find the man in black mentioned by a former senior police officer.\n\n\"I've investigated all the surveillance footage around the police station, the surrounding streets, and even some shops in the vicinity. I haven't found that man in black,\" Zheng Tian investigated very meticulously, but still found nothing.\n\nOld Xu merely nodded slightly at this result and didn't say much. In fact, before Zheng Tian began his investigation, Old Xu had already anticipated this outcome.\n\n\"Could Uncle Song have seen incorrectly?\" After the investigation, Zheng Tian was a little suspicious, wondering if the former senior police officer had misidentified.\n\n\"If he just saw incorrectly, how could Uncle Song describe the other person's appearance in such detail?\" The former senior police officer had narrated very vividly. If he had just misidentified, Chen Hui felt that the officer shouldn't have been able to describe it so precisely.\n\n\"That's true.\" After hearing Chen Hui's words, Zheng Tian thought about it and nodded in agreement. \"But if none of the nearby surveillance recorded that man in black, could this man in black be a top hacker who hacked into all the surrounding surveillance cameras?\" Zheng Tian usually watched some hacker movies and greatly admired the hackers in them.\n\n\"A hacker? If the man in black in the surveillance was just a hacker, then what about the missing body? Would a hacker steal a corpse?\" Ning Hua directly rejected Zheng Tian's idea.\n\n\"This...\" Zheng Tian was speechless. A hacker stealing a corpse, if true, would probably be unprecedented.\n\n\"Xiao Tian, do me a favor. Organize all the surveillance videos, send them all to me, and then we'll look through them again together to see if there are any new discoveries.\" Old Xu interrupted their conversation and assigned Zheng Tian a task.\n\n\"Okay.\" Upon hearing Old Xu's request, Zheng Tian didn't say much. After bidding farewell to the others, he left to complete the task assigned by Old Xu.\n\nAfter Zheng Tian left, Zhao Zhen looked at Old Xu, guessed what was on his mind, and then asked Old Xu to confirm, \"Old Xu, you don't want to involve that child in the case, do you?\" In fact, Zhao Zhen could see that Old Xu asked Zheng Tian to collect the surveillance footage not for the investigation, but simply to get him away for now.\n\n\"Too many people are already involved in the case. We can't implicate anyone else.\"\n\n\"Indeed, since we started investigating, we've already implicated many people.\" Chen Hui also said with emotion. Since the investigation began, quite a few people had paid with their lives just for investigating this case.\n\n\"We have no choice, but that child still has a choice. From now on, if we need his help, it's fine, but everyone must remember, we absolutely cannot let that child be too closely connected to the case we are investigating.\" Old Xu cautioned everyone as he spoke.\n\nEveryone nodded in agreement. In fact, everyone's thoughts at the moment were the same as Old Xu's – they didn't want more people to be entangled in the case.\n\n\"The wounds on this body... I feel like I've heard of them somewhere.\" In the mortuary, Old Xu looked at the body in the body bag and fell into thought.\n\n\"The Yunxiang High School case.\" Following Old Xu's words, Ning Hua immediately recalled that Lin Xiao had mentioned before that during the investigation of the Yunxiang High School case, four bodies, torn apart by something unknown, were found in a dilapidated house. Now, looking at the body in the body bag, Ning Hua instantly connected the two.\n\n\"Yunxiang High School, I remember too. Detective Lin previously said that five students went missing from Lin Xiao's high school, and eventually, the bodies of four students were found in a dilapidated house not far from the school. However, there's still no news about the last student.\" Chen Hui also recalled the Yunxiang High School case.\n\n\"Now that you mention it, I remember too. At that time, Lin Xiao said that the bodies of the four students were mangled, as if gnawed by wild dogs. But later investigations found no wild dogs in the vicinity.\" Zhao Zhen remembered the Yunxiang High School incident at the last moment and also provided crucial final information.\n\n\"Yes, this current body... I suspect, most likely, the perpetrator is the same as the one Lin Xiao and the others encountered before.\" Looking at the wounds on the body in the body bag, Old Xu made his judgment.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, but I have a question. Why disfigure the body like this after killing? The other cases involving the 'Route 18' bus didn't show any such signs.\" Chen Hui raised a question in his mind to Old Xu.\n\n\"Could it be that the 'Route 18' bus cases and these two cases are not by the same killer?\" Ning Hua felt that the killer who murdered the four students from Yunxiang High School and the deceased in the body bag was not the same person as the killer from the 'Route 18' bus.\n\n\"Not the same killer? But these two cases are closely related to the 'Route 18' bus. Could it be that there are two killers involved in the 'Route 18' bus cases?\" Zhao Zhen frowned and analyzed.\n\n\"Even with just one killer, we've been investigating for so long without any clues. If there's another killer...\" At this point, Chen Hui felt his head spinning.\n\n\"If there really are two killers, then are these two killers human or ghosts?\" Zhao Zhen muttered, thinking of another important question.\n\n\"Should we contact Detective Lin to inquire specifically about the Yunxiang High School matter?\" Ning Hua felt that at this point, contacting Lin Xiao for confirmation of what happened back then might lead to some discoveries.\n\nOld Xu did not answer Ning Hua's suggestion, but instead frowned and fell into thought.\n\n\"If we're going to ask Detective Lin, let's contact Binzi first and see what he says.\" Seeing that Old Xu didn't speak, Chen Hui suggested contacting Ye Bin first.\n\n\"Yes, let's contact Binzi first and make a decision after discussing it with him.\"\n\nAfter Old Xu finished speaking, the others didn't say anything further and all implicitly agreed to Old Xu's proposal.\n\nAfter that, Old Xu dialed Ye Bin's phone and informed him in detail about the mortuary.\n\n\"The body is missing?\" After hearing Old Xu's words, Ye Bin's first question was not about the deceased's body, but about the missing body of \"Ding Xiaoqian.\"\n\n\"Okay, I understand. I'll contact Detective Lin to inquire about the Yunxiang High School matter.\"\n\nAfter Ye Bin finished speaking, Old Xu then inquired about Lu Qianxun, \"Where is Qianxun? How is he? Is there any problem?\" Although he had asked Chang Hongshan to help examine Lu Qianxun, Old Xu was still worried about Lu Qianxun's safety.\n\n\"He's fine, just still unconscious.\"\n\n\"That's good.\" After inquiring about Lu Qianxun's safety, Old Xu hung up the phone with peace of mind.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 146: The Source\n\n\"Detective Lin, by your expression, it seems you recognize this little girl?\" When Lisa mentioned the little girl in the black dress, she saw Detective Lin Xiao's expression change dramatically for the first time. This made Lisa exceptionally curious about who this mysterious little girl could be.\n\nLin Xiao's face was grim, and he did not answer Lisa's question. However, at that moment, Lin Xiao was lost in thought. He had never imagined that the factory accident from five years ago would be connected to the 'Route 18' bus case.\n\n\"Detective Lin, who exactly is that little girl?\" Seeing Lin Xiao's current state, Lisa's curiosity grew even stronger.\n\nFacing Lisa's question, Lin Xiao still chose to remain silent. After a moment, Lin Xiao's mind calmed down. \"It's nothing. Let's continue the investigation. We're running out of time. Let's go see the source of the accident from that year and see if we can find any clues,\" Lin Xiao said, ignoring Lisa beside him and walking alone towards the origin of the factory accident.\n\nSeeing this, Lisa didn't say anything further and followed closely behind Lin Xiao towards the site of the accident's origin.\n\nBecause the factory wasn't very large, Lin Xiao and Lisa arrived at the origin of the accident shortly after.\n\n\"Judging by the extent of the damage in the surrounding area, this should be the origin of the accident that year,\" Lin Xiao carefully examined the shattered half-warehouse, damaged due to the accident, and made his judgment.\n\n\"Indeed, this is the origin of the accident that year.\" Lisa's gaze swept across the surroundings, clearly showing that this was her first time here.\n\nLin Xiao noticed Lisa's behavior and felt a hint of doubt. Upon entering the factory, it was evident that Lisa had been there more than once. However, now, at the origin of the accident, Lisa seemed as if she had never been there before.\n\n\"What are you looking for?\" After observing the surroundings, Lisa's gaze didn't stop. She continued to scan the area, making Lin Xiao feel that she was searching for something.\n\n\"A corpse,\" Lisa replied plainly.\n\n\"A corpse? What corpse?\" Lin Xiao asked, a look of confusion crossing his face.\n\n\"Detective Lin, you probably haven't forgotten the supernatural events I mentioned earlier. In the subsequent events related to that supernatural incident, it is said that an unknown corpse appeared at the origin site. All employees who saw that corpse died mysteriously. The surviving employees only heard that there was a corpse here, but no one dared to set foot here,\" Lisa explained while continuing to search, seemingly unafraid of what she was saying.\n\n\"Everyone who saw that corpse died. Aren't you afraid?\" Lin Xiao was also confused as to why Lisa was so calm at this moment.\n\n\"With Detective Lin accompanying me, even becoming a ghost would be worth it,\" Hearing Lin Xiao's words, Lisa turned her head and gave him a sweet smile.\n\nUpon seeing this, Lin Xiao's expression immediately sank. He then said coldly, \"If you want to do it, do it yourself. I'm not interested.\"\n\n\"Haha, don't worry, Detective Lin. I inquired before I came, and that corpse here is gone. Otherwise, I wouldn't have brought Detective Lin here to take such a risk.\"\n\n\"Since you already know it's gone, why are you still searching everywhere?\" Lin Xiao did not believe Lisa's words.\n\n\"I'm just curious about what kind of corpse it is that carries such a terrifying curse,\" Lisa said with a smile, her expression very calm.\n\nLin Xiao didn't say anything further upon hearing this. Instead, he asked Lisa another question, \"Where is the bus captured in the photograph?\" In fact, after arriving at the factory, Lin Xiao had been comparing the surroundings, but he hadn't found any place that matched the bus in the photo.\n\n\"Uh, actually, I forgot where it was taken. This factory is quite large.\" Lisa showed an embarrassed smile. However, Lin Xiao harbored immense suspicion towards her at this moment.\n\n\"Forgot? It seems you have quite a bad memory,\" Lin Xiao said coldly, his words laced with doubt.\n\n\"Detective Lin, please rest assured, I won't lie to you. Since I brought you here, I will let you see that bus. However, I don't know what will happen after you see that bus,\" Lisa said, a meaningful smile appearing on her face.\n\nLin Xiao paid no attention to Lisa's words. Just then, his phone suddenly rang. Lin Xiao took out his phone and saw the number belonged to Ye Bin. He immediately answered.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Detective Lin, I'd like to ask you something.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"When you were investigating the Yunxiang High School case, what exactly happened at the crime scene?\"\n\nUpon hearing Ye Bin directly ask about the Yunxiang High School case, Lin Xiao realized that Ye Bin must have discovered something.\n\n\"Did you find something?\" Lin Xiao did not rush to answer Ye Bin's question, but instead asked back.\n\n\"A case occurred at the police station where Old Xu and his team are. You should know about it.\"\n\n\"Mm, he contacted me before, saying he needed to investigate the case related to 'Ding Xiaoqian' and asked for my help.\" Old Xu simply recounted the case to Lin Xiao, but Lin Xiao was unaware of the detailed circumstances.\n\n\"A victim appeared at the crime scene. The manner of death is almost identical to the four student victims in the Yunxiang High School case you investigated earlier,\" Ye Bin stated calmly.\n\nHearing Ye Bin's words, Lin Xiao's gaze slightly intensified. \"Consistent with the cause of death of the four students in the Yunxiang High School case? How did this victim die?\"\n\n\"According to the clues Old Xu and his team have gathered so far, it is highly likely related to the corpse that went missing from the police station.\"\n\n\"In the Yunxiang High School case, the bodies of the four students at the crime scene seemed to have been torn apart by something. Other than that, I couldn't find any clues. I only discovered that there was a 'Route 18' bus stop sign not far from Yunxiang High School. Therefore, I inferred that the Yunxiang High School case had some connection with the 'Route 18' bus. Later, I visited the crime scene multiple times for investigation, and reviewed all the surveillance footage around the crime scene, but still found no clues.\" Lin Xiao's investigation was extremely thorough, yet even so, he had not found any leads.\n\n\"In Detective Lin's opinion, what tore the bodies of the four students apart?\" Ye Bin inquired.\n\n\"At first, I thought it was wild dogs in the vicinity. However, I thoroughly investigated the school surroundings, including all the households that owned dogs nearby, but found nothing unusual. Therefore, I concluded that the bodies were not gnawed by wild dogs, but there was another reason,\" Lin Xiao recounted his deductions to Ye Bin.\n\n\"What reason?\"\n\n\"I haven't figured that out yet.\" Lin Xiao did not hide anything and fully explained the details of the Yunxiang High School case to Ye Bin.\n\n\"Thank you for your help, Detective Lin,\" Ye Bin said, and then directly hung up the phone.\n\nAfter putting away his phone, Lin Xiao turned to Lisa beside him. \"Have you remembered yet?\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 147 Bus in the Dark\n\nThe light of the sun gradually dimmed, and the darkness fell, taking charge of the entire earth\n\nThere are dazzling neon lights in the noisy city against the dark night, but the deserted factory located deep in the mountains can only be vaguely distinguished by the faint light of the moon.\n\n\"Are you sure that the bus will appear?\" Lin Qing and Lisa hid in the corner of the warehouse, leaning on the faint moonlight, observing a clearing outside the warehouse.\n\n\"I can't be completely sure, but the last time, I saw the bus appearing, and I took a photo.\" Lisa looked at the open space outside the warehouse, and she had no idea.\n\n\"Where did the bus come from?\" Lin Jun looked around, curious about where the bus that Lisa said was driving out from\n\nLisa said that, and an awkward smile appeared on her face, \"I don't know this either.\"\n\n\"Didn't you take photos? Why don't you know where the bus is driven from?\" Lin Jun's face suddenly fell when he heard Lisa's answer.\n\n\"I did take that photo, but it was just a photo I left here.\" In fact, Lisa did not really see the bus, but just a photo captured by a photo I left in the factory.\n\nAfter hearing Lisa's explanation, Lin Jun's eyes froze and his face dipped to the extreme, \"That's what you used to me.\" Lin Jun opened his mouth coldly, his words filled with cold chills.\n\n\"It can't be said that, I did take the photo.\" Feeling the chill in Lin Xun's words, Lisa hurriedly showed an awkward smile\n\nRegarding Lisa's cunning, Lin Cheng gave up his argument and instead focused his attention on the open space outside the warehouse.\n\n\"Detective Lin, I didn't mean to cheat you.\" Seeing Lin Feng's face at this moment, Lisa also opened her voice, calming and breathing\n\n\"Do you know how dangerous the case I am investigating is?\" Lin Chang's eyes turned, and he looked at Lisa coldly, opening his mouth with a quainted voice\n\nAfter Lin Jun asked this, Lisa pursed her lips and did not answer, but Lisa was a little happy in her heart because she felt that Lin Jun was worried about her safety in her words.\n\nAs time goes by, the night becomes deeper and deeper. The originally faint moonlight is completely covered by the several clouds that suddenly appear in the sky. The deserted factory in the mountains falls into a darkness.\n\nLin Xuan and Lisa hid in the corner of the abandoned warehouse. Their eyes were staring tightly at the open space outside the warehouse, waiting for the mysterious bus to appear.\n\n\"When is the time to take the photo?\" The bus noise did not appear, Lin Xun asked Lisa next to him in a short voice\n\n\"According to the record, it was probably in the early morning.\" Lisa answered as a real person. At this moment, Lin Zhu was very close. Although Lisa gave someone a strong girl before this, at this moment, Lisa became a scared little girl\n\n\"Aren't you not afraid?\"Lin was also a little confused. He didn't understand Lisa. Before that, Lisa's feeling to himself was completely different from what Lisa gave him at this time. Before and after, it was like two different people.\n\n\"Whoever sees a ghost not afraid?\" Lisa muttered and opened her mouth. At this moment, she had completely turned into a little girl who was surprised and needed protection.\n\nLin Xuan said that, but he was helpless and didn't say anything else, but continued to look at the open space outside the warehouse.\n\nAs time passed by minute by second, due to the late night, Lin and the other two could clearly feel a sense of urgency.\n\nAfter a long wind, Lisa, who was wearing only a thin and formal dress, had a cold look, and her whole body began to shake.\n\nSeeing Lisa's body shaking constantly, Lin Jun took off his coat and then gave Lisa \"put it on\"\n\nLooking at the coat Lin Feng passed, Lisa was stunned, but immediately, she clicked a little and took the coat \"Thank you.\"\n\nIn response to Lisa's thanks, Lin Cheng didn't care, but his eyes were still not leaving the open space outside the warehouse.\n\nAs midnight came, a yellow light suddenly appeared on the dark open space outside the warehouse.\n\n\"It's out.\" Lisa looked at the light on the clearing, and suddenly she felt a cold look. Then she felt the silence behind her.\n\nLin Jun stretched out his hand and blocked Lisa's mouth with his right hand, very afraid that Lisa would scream in fear when she saw something terrible.\n\n\"Don't shout, otherwise we'll be irritated.\" Lin Xu opened his voice and told Lisa\n\nLisa clicked a little, and he also understood the shape at this moment. Then he hugged Lin Jun's arm with two hands.\n\n\"Swish\" The sound of the bus opening sounded, and when Lin Qing and Lisa had no idea at all, a broken bus appeared in front of the two of them.\n\nLisa pursed her lips tightly, and there was a cold sweat coming out of her head. Looking at the bus that suddenly appeared in the open space, Lisa narrowed her eyes, afraid of seeing something terrible\n\nLin Jun looked at the bus on the open space. Although he was not too scared, he was very shocked. You know, the bus appeared suddenly under Zi's nose.\n\nThe buses on the open space are open on both sides of the front and back, but no one gets on the car or gets off.\n\nLin Jun's eyes were on the front and back doors of the bus, and wanted to see clearly what people were on the car through the opened doors. However, except for the darkness, Lin Jun could not see anything.\n\n\"There is one hand.\" Lisa opened her mouth tremblingly. She was afraid, and she didn't dare to look at what people were inside the two open doors, so she turned her eyes to other parts of the car. However, at the window on the back of the bus, Lisa saw a hand that seemed to be dripping with blood.\n\nWhen Lin Xun heard Lisa's words, he also noticed the hand beside the window on the rear side of the bus.\"Close your eyes, don't look again,\" Lin said, stretching out his left hand and pressing it in front of Lisa.\n\nLisa pursed her lips and closed her eyes slowly, but when Lisa closed her eyes, the bloody hand she saw just now appeared in the brain.\n\n\"Swish\" for about five minutes, the front and back of the bus closed, and then the bus still moved slowly and drove towards the other direction of the open space.\n\nLin Jun's eyes quickly swung on the bus, trying to find some useful traces, but just as Lin Jun's eyes stopped at the bus driving position, Lin Jun's face suddenly sank, and he was cold.\n\n\"How is this happening?\" Lin Jun looked at the bus driving away in the darkness, and he was stunned.\n\nSeeing this scene, Lisa was also confused and immediately opened her mouth, \"Detective Lin, why are you doing this, you're fine?\"\n\n\"That person is\"\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 148: Mistake\n\nEveryone makes mistakes in life. Sometimes, the mistakes we make can be mended, but other times, the mistakes we make are ones we can never mend, even with a lifetime.\n\nIn Lin Xiao's life journey, Lin Xiao lived very cautiously, just as he approached every case. He treated every small matter with extreme seriousness. Because of this, Lin Xiao rarely made mistakes. However, in life, who can be without fault? Even Lin Xiao, who was extremely careful, made what he considered the biggest mistake in his life's journey.\n\nXiao Xiao was Lin Xiao's first friend in his life journey, and also his last friend.\n\nLin Xiao and Xiao Xiao had known each other since childhood. One aspired to be a police officer, while the other aspired to be a wealthy businessman.\n\nBefore both of them realized their respective dreams, they were the closest friends in the world. While their friendship couldn't be described as earth-shattering, it was, at the very least, admirable.\n\nAfter graduating from university, Lin Xiao and Xiao Xiao started their careers at the same time. Lin Xiao was admitted to the police academy, successfully realizing his dream and becoming a police officer. Xiao Xiao, on the other hand, worked his way up from the bottom. With admirable perseverance, he took one step at a time and became the most famous businessman in the area, though this \"businessman\" was not clean.\n\nOne was a police officer dedicated to upholding justice, while the other was a \"businessman\" who committed all sorts of evils for money. Because of the different paths they chose, the once inseparable friends became \"arch-rivals.\"\n\nWhen Lin Xiao became a police officer, Xiao Xiao did not change his attitude towards Lin Xiao because he was a police officer. However, Lin Xiao, as a police officer, felt that Xiao Xiao was not his kind of person.\n\nPerhaps fate was playing a trick on them. The two who had already gone their separate ways met again through a twist of fate. Xiao Xiao was targeted by the police for smuggling, and the person responsible for investigating Xiao Xiao was none other than Lin Xiao.\n\nAlthough Lin Xiao received orders from his superiors to investigate Xiao Xiao, due to Xiao Xiao's growing influence, he learned of all of Lin Xiao's movements before Lin Xiao could investigate him. When he found out it was his good friend from the past investigating him, Xiao Xiao was very relieved and boasted to his subordinates.\n\n\"Haha! Those cops, they'll never dream that the cop they sent to investigate me is my best brother. Back when we were in school, he always covered for me!\" From the beginning, Xiao Xiao completely trusted Lin Xiao.\n\nOn the other hand, when Lin Xiao investigated and found that the smuggler was Xiao Xiao, Lin Xiao had no intention of covering for Xiao Xiao. Instead, he investigated even more thoroughly.\n\nDuring the investigation, Lin Xiao encountered danger several times, but each time, he managed to escape by luck. Lin Xiao attributed all of this to his good fortune, but in reality, he didn't know that the mastermind he wanted to expose had been protecting him all along.\n\nXiao Xiao had ordered that as long as his subordinates were evading Lin Xiao's investigation, they must not harm Lin Xiao.\n\nAlthough Xiao Xiao had given the order, the smugglers working with Xiao Xiao felt that Lin Xiao was a nuisance and subsequently sent people to assassinate Lin Xiao.\n\nOutnumbered and outmatched, Lin Xiao soon fell into the bandits' den and was captured. But when Xiao Xiao heard that Lin Xiao had been captured, he immediately rushed with a group of his subordinates and personally went to rescue Lin Xiao from the dragon's lair. In order to save Lin Xiao, Xiao Xiao lost one of his most trusted subordinates.\n\n\"You, you really cause trouble. How can you investigate a case like this? Aren't you afraid of dying? If it weren't for me this time, you would be dead.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Lin Xiao only said a word of thanks for Xiao Xiao's rescue and then left.\n\nAt that time, Xiao Xiao did not stop Lin Xiao from leaving when he saw Lin Xiao's demeanor, because he did not want to cause trouble for Lin Xiao, as he was not a person of upright conduct.\n\nAfter Lin Xiao was rescued from the bandits' den by Xiao Xiao, all the police officers who had gone with him to investigate were killed. Because of this incident, Lin Xiao came under suspicion from the police station. Some people within the police station even secretly accused Lin Xiao of colluding with criminals and engaging in murder for profit.\n\n\"What! Nonsense! How could that kid collude with me? These guys are all talking nonsense!\" Upon hearing that Lin Xiao had been framed, Xiao Xiao sent his subordinates everywhere to spread rumors that they were going to hunt down the escaped Lin Xiao. For this reason, Xiao Xiao deliberately had his subordinates stage a performance to force Lin Xiao into a desperate situation.\n\nAs expected, actions spoke louder than words. After Xiao Xiao did this, the suspicion towards Lin Xiao in the police station disappeared.\n\nAfter helping Lin Xiao twice in secret, Xiao Xiao suddenly received an invitation from Lin Xiao one day, with Lin Xiao stating that he wanted to thank him.\n\nUpon receiving the invitation, Xiao Xiao accepted without a second thought. Usually, Xiao Xiao would bring many subordinates to ensure his safety, but this time, Xiao Xiao only brought his woman, wanting to introduce her to his best brother.\n\nBang!\n\nA low gunshot echoed. In the pouring rain, a man in a suit fell to the ground.\n\n\"Hahaha! Hahaha!\" Tears mixed with rain, the man in the suit laughed wildly, staring intently at the police officer in front of him. As a mouthful of blood spurted out, the wild laughter on the man's face disappeared, and he spread his hands, a handgun without a magazine falling into the rain.\n\n\"In the next life, I hope we can still be friends. Next time, I'll be the police officer, I'll... pay.\" The man in the suit's words did not finish before he left forever.\n\nHaving personally killed his best friend, Lin Xiao never made any more friends from that day on. In Lin Xiao's heart, he believed he was unworthy of having friends.\n\nA bus appearing in the darkness caused the most unwelcome memory, sealed in Lin Xiao's heart, to resurface once more.\n\n\"Detective Lin, Detective Lin, what's wrong? Are you okay? Don't scare me!\" Seeing Lin Xiao's vacant eyes, Lisa was extremely anxious. She shook Lin Xiao's shoulders and spoke with concern.\n\n\"How could this be? How could this be? How could it be him? How could it be him?\" Lin Xiao's eyes were unfocused, and he kept murmuring, falling into a state of mental stupor.\n\n\"Him? Who is he! Detective Lin! Are you okay!\" Lisa looked anxious, and seeing Lin Xiao's current state, she was about to cry.\n\n\"Has he returned? Has he returned?\" Lin Xiao continued to murmur, his eyes becoming somewhat hollow.\n\nLisa looked flustered. She never imagined that Lin Xiao, who was always calm in the face of adversity, would be so flustered at this moment.\n\n\"What exactly! What on earth is going on!\" Tears of anxiety streamed down Lisa's face. At such a moment, Lisa was completely panicked, afraid of the bus outside the warehouse and afraid that something would happen to Lin Xiao at this moment.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

Lin Xiao never expected that at such a moment, he would see an old friend again.\n\n\"Detective Lin! Detective Lin, are you okay!\" Lisa spoke urgently with a trembling voice, terrified that something might go wrong with Lin Xiao at this moment.\n\n\"How could it be him? Why him? Is he, is he back for me?\" Lin Xiao completely ignored Lisa's words, just muttering to himself.\n\n\"Detective Lin, Detective Lin...\" Lisa gently called out while pushing Lin Xiao's body, but from beginning to end, Lin Xiao seemed to have lost his soul, his eyes staring blankly ahead, his whole being like an empty shell devoid of any consciousness.\n\nSleepless night. In the corner of the abandoned warehouse, Lisa tightly hugged the \"soulless\" Lin Xiao and cried for an entire night. Only when Lisa's tears ran dry did she stop crying.\n\nThe first ray of dawn sunlight shone through the abandoned warehouse onto Lin Xiao and Lisa. At this moment, Lin Xiao's eyes were still blank, his whole body motionless, as if he had lost his soul. Beside Lin Xiao, Lisa's eyes were bloodshot; having cried all night, her eyes were now somewhat swollen.\n\n\"Detective Lin, let's go back,\" Lisa said hoarsely, looking at Lin Xiao beside her.\n\nLin Xiao ignored Lisa's words, just staring blankly ahead.\n\nSeeing Lin Xiao's appearance, Lisa shook her head and sighed softly. Then, using all her strength, she helped Lin Xiao up, and supporting him, they left the factory.\n\n\"Captain Lin! You're back!\" After Lisa supported Lin Xiao out of the factory, she immediately drove quickly to the police station. When Lisa arrived at the police station entrance, she happened to run into Shen Hua, and when Shen Hua saw Lin Xiao's appearance, he was completely stunned.\n\n\"Ma'am, Captain Lin, what's wrong with Captain Lin!\" As Shen Hua looked at Lin Xiao's blank stare, he hurried forward to help Lisa support Lin Xiao.\n\n\"I... I don't know,\" Lisa said hoarsely. In fact, she didn't know what exactly happened to Lin Xiao for him to suddenly turn into this state.\n\n\"Captain Lin! Captain Lin! Are you okay?\" Shen Hua spoke softly, calling out to Lin Xiao, but from beginning to end, Lin Xiao didn't say a word, just staring blankly ahead.\n\n\"Why is Captain Lin like he's lost his soul? What on earth happened!\" Shen Hua anxiously asked Lisa, his heart full of questions. He really couldn't imagine what could have happened to make the usually calm and composed Lin Xiao turn into this state.\n\n\"I... I don't know,\" Lisa said with a trembling, somewhat stuttering voice. \"Last night, we went to investigate the case and saw a bus. Then, then he turned into this state.\"\n\n\"A bus?\" Hearing Lisa's words, Shen Hua frowned. During this time, following Lin Xiao's investigation, although Lin Xiao hadn't told him much about the case, he had once seen Lin Xiao investigating matters related to \"Bus Route 18.\"\n\n\"Where did you see that bus?\"\n\n\"An abandoned factory,\" Lisa answered truthfully. Compared to her previous appearance, Lisa at this moment was like a frightened little girl, in need of help.\n\n\"An abandoned factory,\" Shen Hua murmured. He was about to ask something else, but seeing Lin Xiao beside him, Shen Hua didn't press further, but instead motioned for Lisa to first help Lin Xiao back to the police station.\n\nAfter helping Lin Xiao back to the police station, Shen Hua first settled Lin Xiao down, then immediately called Fang Chen.\n\n\"Hello, is this Fang Chen?\"\n\n\"Yes, this is Fang Chen. Who is this?\" Fang Chen was a bit puzzled when he received Shen Hua's call, as the number the caller used was Lin Xiao's dedicated contact number for Fang Chen.\n\n\"Hello, my name is Shen Hua, I'm Captain Lin's assistant. Captain Lin has run into a bit of trouble, please come over right away.\"\n\n\"Brother Lin is in trouble!\" Hearing Shen Hua's words, Fang Chen was startled, and a wave of worry immediately rose in his heart. In fact, when Shen Hua called his number, Fang Chen had already had a premonition that something might have happened to Lin Xiao. \"Is Brother Lin okay! Where is he now?\" Fang Chen anxiously spoke, asking Shen Hua.\n\n\"Captain Lin is fine, he's at the police station now. However, Captain Lin's mental state seems to be problematic.\"\n\n\"Mental state!\" Fang Chen frowned, feeling a bit bewildered, but then didn't think too much about it. After telling Shen Hua to take good care of Lin Xiao, he hung up the phone and rushed back to the police station as quickly as possible.\n\nAbout an hour later, Fang Chen rushed into the police station. Shen Hua had already been waiting for a long time since Fang Chen entered the police station.\n\n\"Over here!\" Shen Hua waved, signaling to Fang Chen.\n\nAfter seeing Shen Hua, Fang Chen didn't ask about anything else, immediately asking Shen Hua about Lin Xiao's location: \"Where's Brother Lin?\"\n\n\"The office.\"\n\nWhen Fang Chen opened the door to Lin Xiao's office, the first person he saw was Lisa. Although he wondered who Lisa was, he didn't have time to ask and immediately looked for Lin Xiao in the office. When he saw Lin Xiao sitting by the sofa in the office, Fang Chen froze in place.\n\n\"Brother Lin! What's wrong with you!\" Fang Chen anxiously ran to Lin Xiao's side and then anxiously asked Lin Xiao.\n\nLin Xiao stared blankly ahead, not paying attention to Fang Chen.\n\nSeeing this scene, Fang Chen's face instantly darkened. He then turned to look at Shen Hua and Lisa, \"What's wrong with Brother Lin! How did he become like this!\" Fang Chen's words were tinged with anger, seemingly questioning Shen Hua and Lisa.\n\n\"Captain Lin saw a bus in an abandoned factory, and then he turned into this state,\" Shen Hua said, also looking worriedly at Lin Xiao beside Fang Chen.\n\n\"Abandoned factory? A bus?\" Hearing Shen Hua's words, Fang Chen's gaze suddenly sharpened. Then, Fang Chen turned around and spoke softly, \"Brother Lin, it's Fang Chen. Are you okay? Brother Lin? Brother Lin?\"\n\nSeeing Lin Xiao merely staring blankly ahead with vacant eyes and continuously ignoring him, Fang Chen realized that something must have happened.\n\n\"Where are the abandoned factory and the bus?\" Fang Chen spoke coldly, his gaze chillingly directed at Shen Hua.\n\n\"The factory where the accident happened five years ago in X City,\" Lisa, who was nearby, eagerly spoke up before Shen Hua could.\n\n\"Accident five years ago.\" Hearing Lisa's words, Fang Chen's mind continuously sifted through his memories. Soon, Fang Chen remembered a news report he had once seen, and that news report covered the major accident in X City five years ago.\n\n\"What's in that factory?\" Fang Chen's gaze shifted to Lisa, then he asked coldly. He understood that since Lin Xiao went to that factory, it meant Lin Xiao must have discovered something.\n\nLisa took out a photo from her bag and handed it to Fang Chen. When Fang Chen saw the image in the photo, his face instantly darkened.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "\"Where did you get this photo?\" Fang Chen asked Lisa, his voice laced with anxiety, as he looked at the picture.\n\n\"At the abandoned factory where the accident happened, I installed a surveillance probe, and this photo is the image captured by the probe.\" Lisa answered truthfully, hiding nothing from Fang Chen.\n\n\"Did you find the person in the photo at that abandoned factory?\" Fang Chen asked, pointing to Li Chao in the picture.\n\nLisa shook her head. \"No, we didn't find anything at the abandoned factory, only the bus in the photo.\" Lisa shivered involuntarily as she thought of the bus she saw last night.\n\n\"What was on the bus?\" Fang Chen eagerly asked upon hearing Lisa mention the bus.\n\n\"Because I was very scared at the time and only squinted, I didn't see clearly what was on the bus, but in the rear window of the bus, there seemed to be a severed hand.\" Lisa said, hugging herself and trembling all over, feeling a chilling coldness constantly creeping up behind her.\n\n\"A severed hand.\" Hearing Lisa's words, Fang Chen's face darkened. He then frowned and fell into deep thought. Shen Hua, overhearing Lisa and Fang Chen's conversation, also felt a chill down his spine.\n\nAfter a long pause, Fang Chen turned his gaze to Lin Xiao behind him. Although he didn't know what had happened, seeing the usually calm and collected Lin Xiao in his current state made Fang Chen realize that something must have occurred.\n\n\"Could Team Lin have encountered a ghost?\" After hearing Lisa's account, Shen Hua had this thought. In fact, Shen Hua wasn't the only one; Fang Chen also harbored doubts. Could Lin Xiao have run into something unclean? Otherwise, why would Lin Xiao suddenly become like this?\n\n\"It's not certain yet, but I know someone who, if we find him, might be able to figure out what happened to Brother Lin.\" Fang Chen immediately thought of Lu Qianxing and took out his phone to call Ye Bin.\n\n\"Hello, is this Ye Bin? I'm Fang Chen, Detective Lin's assistant.\"\n\n\"Fang Chen? What's wrong? Is there something?\" Hearing it was Fang Chen, Ye Bin asked curiously.\n\n\"Is Lu Qianxing with you?\"\n\n\"Qianxing? Yes, but something happened to him, and he's currently in a coma.\"\n\nUpon hearing that Fang Chen was looking for Lu Qianxing, Ye Bin realized that Fang Chen had likely encountered a \"supernatural event.\"\n\n\"Coma? What happened?\" Fang Chen was surprised to hear that Lu Qianxing was in a coma.\n\n\"It's a long story. Are you looking for Qianxing because you've run into some trouble?\" Ye Bin guessed. From Fang Chen's words, Ye Bin could sense Fang Chen's urgency.\n\n\"Detective Lin had a bit of an issue.\" Fang Chen didn't hide anything from Ye Bin.\n\n\"Detective Lin is in trouble?\" Ye Bin was stunned for a moment, then anxiously inquired about Lin Xiao's condition.\n\nAfter Fang Chen briefly explained the situation, Ye Bin's expression turned serious.\n\n\"You're saying Detective Lin has been possessed?\" Based on Fang Chen's account, Ye Bin felt that Lin Xiao's current state was very likely due to him provoking something unclean and becoming possessed.\n\n\"Yes, Brother Lin's condition is too abnormal, so I wanted to ask Lu Qianxing for help to see what's going on with Brother Lin.\"\n\n\"Qianxing hasn't woken up yet. Why don't you take Detective Lin back to the villa first, and we can all think of a solution together.\"\n\n\"Since Lu Qianxing is in a coma, I'll take Brother Lin to the temple we visited before. Let's see if that master¹ has any solutions.\" With Lu Qianxing unconscious, Fang Chen decided to take Lin Xiao to the temple to ask Lin Hong for help.\n\n\"Be careful. Contact me anytime if anything happens.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nAfter hanging up Ye Bin's call, Fang Chen was very worried about Lin Xiao. Without any delay, he drove Lin Xiao to the temple to seek Lin Hong's help. Before leaving, Fang Chen instructed Lisa and Shen Hua to wait for his news at the police station.\n\nFang Chen drove very fast. In less than half an hour, he arrived in front of the temple. After parking the car, Fang Chen supported the \"soul-lost\" Lin Xiao and entered the temple.\n\nUpon entering the temple with Lin Xiao, Fang Chen only saw a young monk diligently sweeping the courtyard with a broom. This young monk was Lin Hong's disciple, Kong Nian.\n\n\"Little Master Kong Nian!\" Fang Chen called out Kong Nian's name.\n\nHearing Fang Chen's call, Kong Nian, who was sweeping, was startled for a moment. He then turned around, but when he saw Fang Chen and the other person at the temple entrance, Kong Nian scratched his head, a hint of surprise flashing across his face.\n\n\"Uncle-master!\"²\n\nFang Chen, supporting Lin Xiao, walked up to Kong Nian and got straight to the point, asking anxiously, \"Little Master Kong Nian, is your master here?\"\n\n\"Master is traveling and has not returned.\" Kong Nian put down the broom he was holding, then clasped his hands together and bowed respectfully to Fang Chen and the other person.\n\n\"What's wrong with Uncle-master?\" At this moment, Kong Nian also noticed Lin Xiao's abnormality and asked with confusion.\n\n\"Little Master, please take a look. Do you have any solutions? Brother Lin suddenly became like this. Has he been possessed!\" With Lin Hong absent, Fang Chen placed his hope on Kong Nian.\n\nKong Nian nodded, then walked to Lin Xiao's side. He then softly called out to Lin Xiao, \"Uncle-master, Uncle-master...\"\n\nAfter calling out several times, Lin Xiao did not respond. Kong Nian helplessly shook his head and looked at Fang Chen. \"Benefactor, Uncle-master isn't responding to me.\"\n\n\"No, I don't mean that. I mean, can you help me see what happened to Brother Lin to make him like this!\" Fang Chen said, his face showing anxiety.\n\n\"Amitabha, benefactor, I am just a young monk and have only been with Master for a short time. I cannot tell if Uncle-master has been possessed.\" Kong Nian said, displaying a rather awkward smile.\n\n\"Then can you contact your master?\" Hearing that Kong Nian had no solutions, Fang Chen became even more anxious.\n\n\"This...\" Kong Nian said, shaking his head helplessly.\n\n\"This is bad!\" Fang Chen pursed his lips, looking anxious, but could think of no solution.\n\n\"Benefactor, you need not worry. Although I have no solutions, the temple has a brocade pouch left by Master. He told me to open it when Uncle-master was in trouble.\"\n\n\"There's a brocade pouch!\" Hearing about the brocade pouch, Fang Chen was immediately surprised. He then placed a hand on Kong Nian's shoulder and anxiously said, \"Where is it? Hurry! Go get the brocade pouch.\"\n\n\"Benefactor, please remain calm.\" Kong Nian bowed respectfully to Fang Chen, then turned and left, returning to the temple to retrieve the brocade pouch.\n\n(End of Chapter)\n\n---\n¹ Master: In this context, \"master\" likely refers to a senior monk or spiritual leader.\n² Uncle-master: In a monastic hierarchy, \"Uncle-master\" refers to a fellow disciple of one's own master, or a disciple of one's master's master. In this case, it implies Lin Xiao is senior to Kong Nian in their shared spiritual lineage, possibly a senior disciple of the same master or a disciple of the master's teacher.",

Master told me to give this pouch to Uncle-Master if he were ever in trouble,\" Fang Chen waited for nearly ten minutes before Kong Nian emerged with a small brocade pouch.\n\n\"What's inside the pouch? Hurry and open it to see,\" Seeing the brocade pouch in Kong Nian's hand, Fang Chen eagerly urged him to open it.\n\nKong Nian shook his head slightly at Fang Chen's urging. \"Benefactor, Master repeatedly instructed that this brocade pouch must be opened by Uncle-Master himself. Otherwise, the pouch would lose its meaning.\"\n\nHearing Kong Nian's words, Fang Chen finally calmed down and then turned his gaze to Lin Xiao beside him.\n\n\"Given Brother Lin's current state, even opening the pouch himself would be a problem.\" In fact, Fang Chen had been trying to communicate with Lin Xiao on the way to the temple, but Lin Xiao had never responded, making Fang Chen worried about how he would get Lin Xiao to open the pouch himself in his current condition. \"What exactly is in the pouch that requires Brother Lin to open it personally? Can't I just open it for him and then give it to him?\"\n\nKong Nian shook his head slightly and then spoke with firm conviction, \"Master's words will not be wrong. This brocade pouch must be opened by Uncle-Master himself, or it will lose its meaning.\" Kong Nian had unwavering faith in his Master's words.\n\nSeeing Kong Nian's confident expression, Fang Chen could only nod. \"Alright, give the brocade pouch to Brother Lin.\"\n\nAfter Fang Chen spoke, Kong Nian stepped forward, first bowing respectfully to Lin Xiao, and then handed the brocade pouch in his hand to Lin Xiao.\n\nAfter placing the pouch in Lin Xiao's hand, Kong Nian took a step back, then clasped his hands together again and bowed respectfully to Lin Xiao. \"Amitabha.\"\n\nLin Xiao clutched the brocade pouch, his gaze still fixed blankly ahead, as if he hadn't even noticed that he was holding a brocade pouch.\n\n\"Brother Lin, can you hear me? Brother Lin!\" Fang Chen, standing beside him, became anxious and called out softly to Lin Xiao, but the result was still the same. Lin Xiao seemed detached from the world, as if he were in a realm of his own.\n\n\"This can't go on. I'll open the brocade pouch,\" Fang Chen said anxiously, turning to look at Kong Nian beside him.\n\nKong Nian merely shook his head slightly at Fang Chen's words.\n\n\"Brother Lin! Brother Lin!\" Fang Chen called out Lin Xiao's name again and again, he didn't even know how many times he had called out \"Brother Lin,\" but never once did he receive a response from Lin Xiao.\n\nTime ticked by. It had been an entire morning since Fang Chen brought Lin Xiao to the temple. During this morning, Lin Xiao had been sitting on a small stone stool, clutching the brocade pouch, his eyes gazing blankly ahead.\n\nIn contrast, Fang Chen had been pacing in front of Lin Xiao for the entire morning without stopping.\n\n\"No! I can't drag this out any longer! It's just a brocade pouch, even if I open it for Brother Lin, it won't make that much of a difference.\" Fang Chen had asked Kong Nian several times throughout the morning if he could help open the pouch, but each time, Kong Nian's answer was a definitive no.\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"If Brother Lin never opens that brocade pouch, are we just going to wait here forever?\"\n\n\"Benefactor, please believe my Master. He will not be wrong. Since Master repeatedly instructed that Uncle-Master must open the brocade pouch himself, then Master must have his reasons for it,\" Kong Nian said calmly, trying to persuade Fang Chen, who was becoming extremely agitated.\n\n\"We don't even know what happened to Brother Lin. Can just a brocade pouch left by your Master really solve the current problem? What if your Master is wrong?\" Fang Chen harbored a constant worry: if too much time passed, would it affect Lin Xiao's safety?\n\n\"Uncle-Master is Master's most important relative. Master would not let Uncle-Master be in danger. Please rest assured,\" Kong Nian continued to speak calmly, persuading Fang Chen.\n\n\"Sigh...\" Finally, Fang Chen let out a long sigh, resigning himself to believing Kong Nian.\n\n\"In this world, the person who understands me best is still you.\" During the long wait, a familiar voice reached Fang Chen's ears.\n\n\"Brother Lin!\" Fang Chen was momentarily stunned, then turned his gaze to Lin Xiao beside him.\n\nLin Xiao had now returned to his usual self from his dazed state. His previously vacant eyes had regained their usual coldness.\n\n\"Brother Lin! Are you okay!\" Seeing Lin Xiao's complexion return to normal, Fang Chen exclaimed with excitement.\n\n\"Mm, I'm fine. I've made you worry,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, a hint of an apologetic smile crossing his lips.\n\n\"It's okay! It's good that you're okay! Brother Lin, you scared me to death!\" Fang Chen said, his eyes moist with emotion.\n\nLin Xiao walked to Fang Chen's side and gently patted his shoulder. \"Alright, we still have things to do. We don't have time for all this crying.\" Lin Xiao said, a smile appearing on his face.\n\n\"Brother Lin, what exactly happened? Why did you suddenly become like that!\" Now that Lin Xiao was alright, Fang Chen voiced the doubts in his heart.\n\n\"I'll tell you slowly on the way. Wait for me,\" Lin Xiao said, walking to Kong Nian and returning the unopened brocade pouch to him. \"Give this back to your Master and tell him, thank you.\"\n\n\"I will, Uncle-Master,\" Kong Nian nodded with a smile and took back the pouch. \"Uncle-Master, Master said that when you overcome this tribulation, I should give you another message.\"\n\n\"Speak,\" Lin Xiao replied.\n\n\"Master said, he's waiting for you to come back.\"\n\nLin Xiao was momentarily stunned by Kong Nian's words, clearly not expecting what Lin Hong had left for him.\n\n\"Good! I will return!\" Lin Xiao said with a smile, a weight finally lifted from his heart.\n\nAfter saying goodbye to Kong Nian, the two of them drove away from the temple and headed back to the police station. On the way back, Fang Chen once again asked Lin Xiao about the reason for his \"lost soul\" state.\n\n\"Brother Lin, a woman named Lisa at the police station showed me a photo. The photo had Li Chao and a bus on it. If I'm not mistaken, that bus should be the 'Route 18' bus, right? Also, I heard Lisa say that you went to a derelict factory and saw the 'Ghost Bus.' What exactly is going on? And Brother Lin, why did you suddenly turn into that state, and why did you suddenly recover?\" Fang Chen poured out a series of questions from his heart.\n\n\"That derelict factory had an accident five years ago. After the accident, there was a 'supernatural' incident during the cleanup work. A little girl in a black dress appeared at the scene of the accident.\"\n\n\"Little girl...\" Hearing about the little girl in the black dress, Fang Chen shivered. \"So, that derelict factory is also connected to the 'Route 18' bus.\"\n\n\"Mm, it should be.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 152: An Unfinished Promise\n\nAfter Lin Xiao recovered, Fang Chen and Lin Xiao drove back to the police station. On the way back, Fang Chen was very curious as to why Lin Xiao had suddenly become \"soulless\" and then inexplicably recovered.\n\n\"Brother Lin, I've always had a question in my heart. What exactly happened to make you become like that?\" Fang Chen guessed that Lin Xiao's state was definitely due to being possessed by an evil spirit. Otherwise, based on his understanding of Lin Xiao, there was nothing that could make Lin Xiao \"soulless.\"\n\nHearing Fang Chen's question, Lin Xiao's expression changed subtly. From Lin Xiao's calm face, Fang Chen sensed an indescribable helplessness and sadness.\n\n\"Brother Lin, if it's not convenient to answer, just pretend I didn't ask,\" Fang Chen said, realizing that this matter should be Lin Xiao's secret.\n\n\"When I was very young, I had a friend. He was the first friend in my life, and also the last,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, his eyes becoming a little distant.\n\nFang Chen only glanced at Lin Xiao and didn't speak. He kept driving, quietly listening to Lin Xiao's words.\n\n\"Since childhood, I always covered up his mistakes in front of the teacher. Sometimes, when discovered by the teacher, we were punished together. And he, in secret, always protected me. At that time, we, as children, made a promise. After growing up and achieving our respective dreams, when he made mistakes, I would still cover for him, and he would always protect me.\" Lin Xiao slowly lowered his head, a hint of guilt crossing his face.\n\nAt this moment, although Fang Chen was driving and didn't notice Lin Xiao's expression, he could already hear Lin Xiao's guilt towards that \"friend\" from his words.\n\n\"Did he commit a crime?\" Fang Chen knew Lin Xiao, as a police officer, would not cover up for any criminal. Therefore, Fang Chen guessed that Lin Xiao's friend had likely committed a crime, and after doing so, he did not receive Lin Xiao's protection. Perhaps, Fang Chen even guessed that he might have been arrested by Lin Xiao himself.\n\n\"He achieved his dream and became a 'businessman,' but this 'businessman' was not clean,\" Lin Xiao calmed his emotions and answered Fang Chen's question calmly.\n\nFang Chen fell silent. Based on Lin Xiao's answer, his guess was confirmed.\n\n\"I killed him,\" Lin Xiao's next sentence made Fang Chen freeze for a moment, even the car they were driving in seemed to fluctuate with Fang Chen's emotions.\n\nFang Chen had thought Lin Xiao might have arrested him, leading to his guilt, but he never expected Lin Xiao to have personally shot and killed him. This made Fang Chen understand, in an instant, why Lin Xiao had said at the beginning that \"he was the first friend in my life, and also the last.\"\n\n\"Did you not expect it?\" Lin Xiao said with a cold laugh, as if asking Fang Chen, or perhaps questioning himself. \"I never expected that at that moment, I would actually shoot at him.\" Lin Xiao gritted his teeth, filled with self-hatred.\n\nFang Chen did not reply. He continued to drive, and after a while, he suddenly pulled the car over to the side of the road and slowly said, \"I'm sorry, Brother Lin, for reminding you of unpleasant things.\"\n\nFacing Fang Chen's apology, Lin Xiao merely shook his head slightly. \"It's fine. Some things, in the end, have to be said. This matter has been weighing on my heart for too many years. Saying it now is a kind of release for me. You don't need to apologize. Instead, I should thank you for being willing to listen to my story.\" Lin Xiao then gave Fang Chen a strained smile.\n\nSeeing Lin Xiao's strained smile, Fang Chen understood that this event had been a heavy blow to him. \"Brother Lin, did you see your friend at that factory?\" Fang Chen reacted quickly, immediately connecting the dots.\n\n\"You could say that, but I don't know if it was really him,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, his gaze lost as he looked ahead. \"At that abandoned factory, I saw that 'Route 18' bus. On that bus, I saw his figure. At that time, he was smiling at me, a smile I'll never forget, the same smile he gave me before he died.\" Lin Xiao then closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and exhaled slowly after a long while.\n\nAfter listening to Lin Xiao's story, Fang Chen was silent. At this moment, Fang Chen truly didn't know what to say.\n\n\"At that time, he raised a gun at me, and as he pulled the trigger, I pulled mine first,\" Lin Xiao said, shaking his head and laughing coldly, a hint of self-mockery on his face. \"As he lay in a pool of blood, I saw that his gun's magazine had already been removed.\" Lin Xiao said, slowly tilting his head back, leaning against the seat, and then taking a deep breath.\n\n\"He fulfilled the childhood promise. Until the end, he was still protecting me. But I broke my promise. I personally sent him to the 'gallows'.\" By the end, Lin Xiao's gaze became sharp, and his tone gradually turned cold.\n\nFang Chen remained silent, but from Lin Xiao's words, Fang Chen could feel Lin Xiao's hatred towards himself, a hatred that made Lin Xiao unable to forgive himself for the rest of his life.\n\nAlthough Fang Chen still had questions in his heart, he didn't continue to ask Lin Xiao. Instead, he started the car again and headed back to the police station.\n\nOn the way, Lin Xiao and Fang Chen were very taciturn. Neither of them spoke about the previous events again. For Lin Xiao, speaking out the long-hidden past in his heart was a release and relief. For Fang Chen, gaining Lin Xiao's trust and hearing his secrets was an honor.\n\nMeanwhile, Old Xu and his team, who were investigating the missing body of \"Ding Xiaoxian,\" could only start with the body in the police station after finding no clues. They decided to dissect the body to find some leads.\n\n\"How is it? Old Chang, any findings?\" After Chang Hongshan finished dissecting the body, Old Xu rushed over and asked anxiously.\n\nChang Hongshan's face was grim, and his expression was not good. \"Old Xu, is this body really from the police station?\" Chang Hongshan didn't answer Old Xu's question but instead asked him back.\n\n\"Yes, what's wrong? Is there a problem?\"\n\n\"According to the autopsy results, the deceased died at least a week ago.\"\n\n\"What! Over a week! How is that possible!\" Hearing Chang Hongshan's words, Old Xu was stunned. After all, it had been no more than two days since the body was discovered, but Chang Hongshan said the deceased had been dead for over two days.\n\n\"At first, I thought I had made a mistake, so I conducted a second examination, but the results were consistent. The deceased's time of death, conservatively speaking, exceeded one week.\"\n\n\"Old Chang, examine it again. See if there was any oversight.\"\n\n\"Old Xu, don't you trust me? Let alone re-examining it once, even ten times, the result won't change. Based on the most conservative estimate, the deceased's time of death has definitely exceeded a week.\"\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 153: Contact\n\nAfter Chang Hongshan's autopsy, Old Xu and the others discovered that the deceased, who had died inexplicably at the police station, had been dead for at least a week. This result greatly surprised Old Xu and his team. To confirm whether Chang Hongshan had made a mistake, at Old Xu's strong insistence, Chang Hongshan re-examined the body in front of Old Xu, confirming the previous findings.\n\n\"Now you can believe it, right?\" Chang Hongshan placed the examination results before Old Xu again and spoke somewhat helplessly.\n\nThis time, Chang Hongshan had performed the examination in front of Old Xu, and Old Xu himself had seen that the body indeed exhibited characteristics that only appear after being dead for over a week.\n\n\"But what exactly is going on? Why would this result occur?\" Although the facts were before him, Old Xu understood that this fact was too bizarre; such a thing should not happen.\n\n\"This can only be explained as 'bizarre',\" Chang Hongshan could not offer any explanation as to why the deceased exhibited characteristics of having been dead for over a week.\n\n\"Old Chang, I'll head back there and investigate thoroughly to see if I can find anything. If there are any issues, I'll contact you,\" With no reasonable explanation found, Old Xu could only choose to leave and return to the crime scene for a detailed investigation.\n\nChang Hongshan nodded at this, then cautioned Old Xu to be careful before asking anything further, as Chang Hongshan himself understood that Old Xu was not trying to cause him trouble.\n\nUpon returning to the police station, Chen Hui and the others eagerly came forward to inquire about Old Xu's findings.\n\n\"Old Xu, how is it? Did the examination results come out? Is it the same as before?\" Zhao Zhen asked anxiously, his heart filled with confusion.\n\n\"The examination results are consistent with the previous ones,\" Old Xu replied in a deep voice.\n\n\"Consistent with the previous ones, the deceased's time of death really exceeds a week!\" Hearing Old Xu's answer, the doubts in everyone's minds resurfaced.\n\n\"Yes, Old Chang was not mistaken.\"\n\n\"This way, it's a bit 'spooky',\" Ning Hua frowned, pondering and recalling a series of recent cases, \"What do you think, could this situation be the same as Li Yang's case?\" Recalling the recent case of Li Chao and his son, Ning Hua felt there were some similarities.\n\n\"It can't be said to be the same, but it is indeed somewhat similar,\" Chen Hui felt it was somewhat similar upon hearing Ning Hua's speculation. After all, Li Chao's father's remains were also found in Heishui Village. After examination, it was found that Li Yang's time of death was around five years ago, but Li Yang had only disappeared not long ago. The time of death in both cases was somewhat bizarre.\n\n\"Perhaps it's not similar, but related,\" Zhao Zhen also had the same idea as Chen Hui and Ning Hua.\n\n\"Without evidence, speculation is useless. Have you investigated the crime scene? Did you find anything? What about the police officers? Did they notice anything unusual about the deceased beforehand?\" Before Old Xu returned to the police station, he had instructed Chen Hui and the others to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the police station.\n\nIn response to Old Xu's words, everyone shook their heads.\n\n\"We found nothing. The deceased had a meal with his colleagues at the police station the morning he died. According to his colleagues, they did not notice any difference in him from his usual self.\" As per Old Xu's instructions, Chen Hui and the others investigated very meticulously, but they found no anomalies in the deceased's life, nor did they find any clues at the crime scene.\n\n\"Did Xiao Tian bring the surveillance records?\"\n\n\"The three of us have already reviewed the surveillance records, and we haven't found any clues.\" Zheng Tian had compiled all the surveillance records and then handed them over to Chen Hui and the other two. However, after repeated viewing, Chen Hui and the other two found no clues.\n\n\"It seems that clarifying this is not an easy task,\" Old Xu had already anticipated this result.\n\n\"Oh right, Binzi contacted us earlier. He said that Detective Lin seems to have made some discovery.\"\n\n\"What discovery?\" Old Xu asked eagerly upon hearing Chen Hui's words.\n\n\"Binzi said that Detective Lin and his team found an abandoned factory, the same factory where the incident occurred in X City five years ago. Furthermore, signs of Li Chao's presence were found in the factory, and the 'Bus Route 18' was also spotted.\"\n\n\"Li Chao!\" Old Xu's expression became agitated upon hearing about Li Chao, \"Have you found Li Chao?\"\n\n\"Li Chao has not been found, but at that factory, Detective Lin personally saw the 'Bus Route 18', and Detective Lin also found an even more important clue: a little girl in a black dress appeared at that factory.\"\n\n\"The little girl?\" Old Xu was already shocked when he heard about the 'Bus Route 18', and when he heard about the little girl, his expression instantly turned grim, \"So, the factory accident five years ago is also related to the 'Bus Route 18'?\"\n\n\"Binzi did not describe it in too much detail, but according to Binzi, it should be so. The factory accident in X City five years ago should be inseparable from the 'Bus Route 18'.\"\n\n\"What about Qian Xing? Has he woken up?\" After Chen Hui finished speaking, Old Xu was still concerned about Lu Qian Xing.\n\n\"No,\" Chen Hui sighed and shook his head slightly.\n\n\"He still hasn't woken up!\" Old Xu said, frowning, his worry for Lu Qian Xing deepening.\n\n\"The investigation here is almost done. Let's go back and meet up with Binzi and the others to discuss our findings,\" Zhao Zhen was also worried about Lu Qian Xing's safety, so he suggested returning to the villa to meet up with Ye Bin and the others to discuss the series of recent cases.\n\n\"Okay,\" Old Xu nodded in agreement, \"I also have something I want to ask Binzi, so let's head back.\"\n\nFinally, by unanimous decision, Old Xu and his team drove back to the villa to meet up with Ye Bin and the other two.\n\nOn the other side, returning from the temple, Lin Xiao and Fang Chen also arrived at the police station. Upon their arrival, Shen Hua and Lisa were stunned the moment they saw Lin Xiao.\n\n\"Team Lin! You? You're alright?\" Seeing Lin Xiao's current appearance, he was completely different from before. At this moment, Lin Xiao had recovered to his former self.\n\n\"Detective Lin, you're okay!\" Lisa's face showed a trace of excitement upon seeing Lin Xiao back to his usual self.\n\nIn response to their inquiries, Lin Xiao simply nodded slightly, \"Yes, I'm fine, don't worry.\"\n\n\"That's great! Team Lin! You really startled me before,\" Hearing Lin Xiao's words, Shen Hua breathed a sigh of relief, a look of relief on his face.\n\nAs for Lisa, she took a step forward and hugged Lin Xiao tightly, causing everyone present, including Lin Xiao, to be taken aback.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 154: Target\n\nThe case hit a dead end, so Old Xu and his group didn't stay at the police station. Instead, they returned to the villa to discuss matters with Ye Bin and the others.\n\n\"First, the inexplicable death of 'Ding Xiaoqian', then the disappearance of the body, followed by the black-clad figure caught on the police station's surveillance and the innocent victim inside the police station. Such a series of strange events in just a few days,\" Zhang Lan said, frowning and falling into thought after listening to Old Xu's group's account in detail.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, you mentioned earlier that you asked someone to examine the body of the victim at the police station, and found that the victim had been dead for a week. What's going on?\" Ye Bin was very concerned about the innocent victim at the police station that Old Xu had mentioned.\n\n\"I asked Old Chang to perform an autopsy on the innocent victim at the police station, but he found that the victim had been dead for at least a week. However, according to our investigation, the victim's actual time of death was less than two days.\"\n\nAfter listening to Old Xu, Ye Bin nodded and continued to ask, \"Were there any other findings besides this?\"\n\n\"Besides the strange wounds on the victim's body, there were no other findings.\"\n\n\"Mm, I also inquired with Detective Lin. The case at Yunxiang High School is basically the same as the case you encountered this time. First, there were strange wounds on the victim's body, and then the time of death. The four students found at Yunxiang High School had all died more than a week ago, but according to Detective Lin's investigation, the four students had only been away from school for a day.\" Ye Bin informed everyone of the detailed content of the Yunxiang High School case he had inquired about from Lin Xiao.\n\n\"Wait, the four students at Yunxiang High School also died more than a week ago? Then, if that's the case, these two cases were indeed committed by the same culprit!\" After hearing Ye Bin's words, Ning Hua had already made a judgment that the Yunxiang High School case and the police station case were committed by the same culprit.\n\n\"The problem now is, who exactly is this culprit?\" Old Xu said, frowning slightly. \"Judging by the current situation, these two cases are likely not man-made.\" Both the Yunxiang High School case and the police station case were too bizarre, so Old Xu believed that the two cases were not man-made.\n\n\"According to our previous deduction, the bus case and these two cases were not committed by the same culprit. Now, if both cases are not man-made, does that mean there are two ghosts!\" Zhao Zhen said, shivering.\n\n\"One ghost is already so difficult to deal with. If there are two ghosts, how are we supposed to investigate?\" Chen Hui said with a wry smile and a sigh.\n\n\"It can't be said that the culprits of these two cases are ghosts. In the Yunxiang High School case, there is still one student who has not been found. In the police station case, a corpse was lost. What if the missing student from Yunxiang High School is already dead? In that case, two corpses would be lost. Combined with the wounds on the bodies at the crime scene, could those two corpses have become 'zombies'!\" Zhao Zhen made a bold assumption.\n\nHearing Zhao Zhen's words, although it sounded a bit too far-fetched, combined with Zhao Zhen's analysis, there was indeed such a possibility.\n\n\"Do you remember that Qian Xing once mentioned 'zombies'?\" Ye Bin recalled the previous discussion with Lu Qianxing about people born in the Yin year, Yin month, Yin day, and Yin hour.\n\n\"Yes, I remember, but I checked the birthdates of the victims at the police station, and they were very ordinary. They were not people born in the Yin year, Yin month, Yin day, and Yin hour,\" Old Xu negated Ye Bin's idea.\n\n\"Does it mean that people who are not born in the Yin year, Yin month, Yin day, and Yin hour won't work?\" Ning Hua raised a question.\n\n\"This still needs to be asked of Qian Xing, but he hasn't woken up yet. This question can only wait until Qian Xing wakes up,\" Ye Bin said, looking at the room where Lu Qianxing was.\n\n\"Our side of things is almost done. The matter is too bizarre. We might need Qian Xing's help. We can only wait for Qian Xing to wake up and see what he says.\" Facing the bizarre case, Old Xu was also helpless. \"By the way, Binzi, what happened on Detective Lin's side? I heard they went to an abandoned factory and met Li Chao?\" Every time Li Chao was mentioned, a trace of worry crossed Old Xu's mind.\n\n\"Yes, everyone should be aware of the accident in X City five years ago.\"\n\n\"Clear. That accident was quite serious and took a long time to subside,\" Chen Hui was the first to speak, remembering the accident five years ago very clearly.\n\n\"Clear, I remember it too,\" Ning Hua followed Chen Hui.\n\nOld Xu and Zhao Zhen nodded and didn't say much.\n\n\"According to Detective Lin, after the accident in the factory five years ago, during the demolition process, there were 'supernatural' events, and the 'little girl' we saw in Blackwater Village also appeared.\" When Ye Bin mentioned the little girl, everyone shivered. Every time they recalled the scene in Blackwater Village, they felt a sense of dread.\n\n\"So, the factory accident?\" Zhao Zhen speculated.\n\n\"The appearance of the little girl was something Detective Lin only learned from a woman. Whether it is true or not is still unclear, but at the factory site, Detective Lin personally saw the bus.\"\n\n\"It appeared again.\" Hearing about the bus, everyone's faces sank.\n\n\"Yes.\" Ye Bin nodded. \"According to Detective Lin's description, the bus at the factory site should be the same as the ghost bus we saw.\"\n\n\"Why did the bus appear there?\" Old Xu murmured, falling into thought. After a moment, he turned to Ye Bin beside him. \"By the way, Binzi, didn't you say that Detective Lin also found traces of Li Chao?\"\n\n\"Yes, on a photograph, Detective Lin saw Li Chao appearing with the bus at the factory. However, Detective Lin did not find Li Chao in the factory.\"\n\n\"Why would Li Chao appear at the factory?\" Ye Bin finished speaking, and Ning Hua asked with a confused look. He really couldn't think of any reason why Li Chao would appear at the factory.\n\n\"It seems we need to investigate this factory thoroughly,\" Old Xu said solemnly, having made a decision to go to the factory where the accident occurred for investigation.\n\n\"Investigation is necessary, but we must wait for Qian Xing to wake up. Otherwise, we might encounter danger,\" Ye Bin agreed to investigate but disagreed with their group going there.\n\n\"That's true. In that case, let's set our next target on this factory. We'll set off directly after Qian Xing wakes up.\"\n\n\"Alas, in the end, we haven't found anything. Everything relies on Qian Xing,\" Chen Hui sighed deeply, a hint of helplessness on his face. Facing \"supernatural\" events, without Lu Qianxing's help, their group could only make no progress.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 155: I Believe Her\n\nUnder a yellowing streetlamp, a man in a black tracksuit sat on the curb, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his gaze indifferent as he looked ahead. Beside him, a girl in a snow-white dress pursed her lips, her eyes filled with confusion, tears tracing a path down her face.\n\n\"Why save me? There's no reason to save me anymore, is there?\"\n\n\"Is he that important to you?\" The man didn't answer the girl's question. Instead, he took a deep drag from his cigarette and, after exhaling a ring of smoke, spoke coldly.\n\n\"You should understand, he's the last of my family in this world.\" The girl replied coldly, her words firm.\n\n\"The only family?\" The man was momentarily stunned by her words. He looked up at the sky. \"When I was little, my mother always told me that when people die, they turn into stars in the sky. But every time, my father would tell her that was false. When people die, it means the end. It means their lives are over. Even if there's an afterlife, it won't be the same person.\" The man spoke slowly, his vacant eyes revealing no emotion.\n\n\"Is that why you're trying so hard?\"\n\n\"She is also my only family. I have nothing left in this world. The meaning of my life is to fulfill her dreams.\" The man spoke coldly. When he mentioned his only family, a glimmer of hope flickered in his vacant eyes, and a faint smile touched his lips.\n\n\"I understand you, but I don't agree with you.\" The man shifted his gaze to the girl beside him. \"In your heart, he is your only family. But in his heart, is it the same? Is it worth sacrificing everything for someone whose feelings you don't even know?\"\n\n\"Then are all your actions worth it?\" The girl didn't answer the man's question but retorted.\n\nHearing her question, the man was slightly taken aback. He then said nothing more, put the cigarette back in his mouth, and took a deep drag. After a long while, he exhaled a ring of smoke.\n\n\"Aren't you afraid I'll kill you right now?\" The man stared ahead indifferently, a chilling threat in his voice.\n\n\"I hope you can kill me.\" The girl replied calmly, unperturbed by his threat.\n\n\"You said earlier that he's a police officer, right? If he knew everything, aren't you afraid he'd arrest you?\" The man seemed not to hear her words, continuing his own line of questioning.\n\n\"To be caught by him personally would be my atonement.\" The girl said, a hint of relief on her face.\n\n\"Hoo!\" The man took another deep drag of his cigarette. After exhaling, he remained silent, then slowly and with difficulty, he stood up from the curb. He then limped away along the roadside.\n\n\"I hope you can stop him. If you can't, I'll have to clear everyone who stands in my way.\" The man hadn't gone far before he suddenly stopped and said coldly in a hoarse voice.\n\n\"Thank you.\" The girl was stunned for a moment before gratefully replying.\n\nThe man seemed not to hear her grateful words, paying no attention. He just continued to move forward with difficulty.\n\nIn the villa, Ye Bin and his team were all busy investigating recent cases. Ye Bin, who was searching for clues in various forums, had his phone ring suddenly, interrupting his train of thought.\n\n\"Unknown number.\" Ye Bin picked up his phone and hesitated for a moment upon seeing the unfamiliar caller ID before answering.\n\n\"Hello?\" Ye Bin asked coldly.\n\n\"Is this Ye Bin?\" A girl's voice came from the other end. The moment Ye Bin heard the voice, he frowned. He was familiar with the voice on the phone and immediately recognized it as Ding Xiaoxian's.\n\n\"You! Ding Xiaoxian!\" Ye Bin's voice was somewhat agitated. For the past few days, Ye Bin had felt a heavy weight on his heart because of Ding Xiaoxian's situation. Now, hearing her voice, that weight was finally lifted.\n\n\"Mhm.\" Ding Xiaoxian replied softly from the other end of the line.\n\n\"Are you alright! Where are you?\" Ye Bin's voice was anxious. Hearing his anxious tone, Ding Xiaoxian felt a warmth spread through her heart.\n\n\"I'm fine. Do you have time? I want to meet you alone. There are some things I need to tell you.\"\n\n\"Okay, where are you? I'll come find you.\" Ye Bin agreed to Ding Xiaoxian's request without a second thought.\n\n\"Tomorrow morning, at that abandoned complex. Come alone.\"\n\n\"Mhm. I got it.\" After Ye Bin finished speaking, he heard Ding Xiaoxian hang up.\n\nAfter Ye Bin hung up, he was surrounded by Old Xu and the others. In fact, the moment Ye Bin excitedly shouted Ding Xiaoxian's name, Old Xu and the team had already gathered around him.\n\n\"Is it Ding Xiaoxian? She really isn't dead? Then who was the missing body from the police station?\" Zhao Zhen asked, his brow furrowed. He was filled with questions about the body that had gone missing from the police station earlier.\n\n\"Binzi, where is she now? Did she say anything?\" Old Xu completely ignored Zhao Zhen's question and quickly interjected, asking Ye Bin.\n\n\"She told me to meet her alone tomorrow at the abandoned complex. She said she has something to tell me.\" Ye Bin did not hide anything and explained directly to everyone.\n\n\"Meet you alone? Binzi, are you sure it's Ding Xiaoxian?\" Chen Hui found the situation a bit strange and harbored doubts about whether the person on the phone was truly Ding Xiaoxian.\n\n\"Based on her voice, I can't be wrong.\" Ye Bin didn't know why he was so sure it was Ding Xiaoxian, but his intuition told him it was indeed Ding Xiaoxian.\n\n\"Suddenly disappearing, and then suddenly reappearing, and now asking you to meet her alone. It's all very strange. Tomorrow, you should have someone accompany you. If something happens, it'll be troublesome.\" Ning Hua felt it was too dangerous for Ye Bin to go alone.\n\n\"I think it's better not to go. Let's wait until Qian Xing wakes up. If the other party is human, it's fine. But if it's a ghost...\" Zhang Lan suddenly spoke, interrupting everyone's thoughts.\n\nHearing Zhang Lan's words, everyone's faces sank.\n\n\"Indeed, Fatty Lan is right. I feel the same way.\" Zhao Zhen agreed with Zhang Lan's thoughts.\n\n\"Yeah, Binzi. Although I know you're eager to solve the case and anxious to know if Ding Xiaoxian is alright, a single phone call can't confirm if it's really Ding Xiaoxian. If anything happens, we can't bear the responsibility.\" Chen Hui said, trying to persuade Ye Bin. He also disagreed with Ye Bin going on this risky venture.\n\n\"You can go, but you can't go alone. Someone must accompany you, and we'll have to wait outside.\" Amidst everyone's arguments, Old Xu proposed a plan.\n\n\"No! Old Xu, that's too dangerous! We don't even know if the other party is human or a ghost! If something happens, it'll be a disaster.\"\n\n\"If the meeting is during the day, the other party shouldn't be a ghost, right?\" Ning Hua commented, sharing the same opinion as Old Xu. \"Ding Xiaoxian plays a crucial role in the case. I also think we should go and see. However, you can't go alone. I'll accompany you, Binzi.\" Ning Hua volunteered to go with Ye Bin.\n\n\"You don't need to argue anymore. I've already decided. I'm going, and I'm going alone.\"\n\n\"Binzi...\" As everyone was about to say something, Ye Bin raised his hand to stop them.\n\n\"Everyone, trust me this once. Besides, I believe her.\" Ye Bin said firmly and then looked at everyone.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

If anything happens, contact us immediately. Remember to text us every hour,\" Zhang Lan solemnly instructed Ye Bin before he left.\n\n\"Indeed, Binzi, we still don't know the other party's purpose in looking for you. Be careful with everything. Contact us first if anything comes up; don't take risks alone,\" Old Xu also cautioned.\n\n\"Brother Lan, Uncle Xu, don't worry. I'll be fine. I believe Ding Xiaoqian won't harm me. Just wait for me to come back,\" Ye Bin said with a smile, trying to reassure everyone.\n\n\"Once you fall in love, right and wrong often become indistinguishable. Don't let her completely charm you; stay sharp at all times,\" Chen Hui joked, not wanting to put too much pressure on Ye Bin's mind.\n\nAfter Chen Hui finished, Ning Hua also smiled slightly at Ye Bin. \"Binzi, be careful. Everyone has your back.\"\n\n\"That's right! If anything happens, remember everyone; don't take risks alone! Solving the case is important, but if you're dead, nothing else matters,\" Zhao Zhen said rather bluntly, earning a glare from Old Xu.\n\n\"At a time like this, what do you mean 'if you're dead'? Is that how you talk?\"\n\n\"Uh, Binzi, I didn't mean it like that. I just speak my mind. Anyway, be careful with everything.\" Hearing Old Xu's reprimand, Zhao Zhen scratched his head, looking awkward.\n\n\"Thank you, Uncle Zhao,\" Ye Bin smiled slightly at Zhao Zhen and then turned to leave alone.\n\nYe Bin drove a car, not too slowly. In about forty minutes, he arrived at a road not far from the abandoned residential area.\n\nAfter parking the car by the roadside, Ye Bin got out and crossed through the overgrown weeds to reach the abandoned complex.\n\nAs he passed through the weeds and arrived at the abandoned residential area, Ye Bin saw Ding Xiaoqian, who seemed to have been waiting for a long time, from a distance.\n\nDing Xiaoqian stood at the entrance, holding a faded toy. The moment she saw Ye Bin, a smile appeared on her face.\n\n\"You're here,\" Ding Xiaoqian said with a smile, asking Ye Bin, who was walking through the weeds.\n\n\"You're here so early? Do you live here?\" Ye Bin thought he had arrived quite early, but upon his arrival, he realized Ding Xiaoqian seemed to have been there for a while.\n\n\"Do you think a place like this is livable?\" Ding Xiaoqian asked with a very charming smile.\n\n\"That's true,\" Ye Bin smiled slightly. At that moment, seeing Ding Xiaoqian's charming smile, Ye Bin could clearly feel his heart rate accelerating.\n\n\"Speaking of which, why did you suddenly ask me to meet you here? Also, what do you want to tell me? And lastly, what happened with your disappearance before?\" Ye Bin got straight to the point, firing a series of questions at Ding Xiaoqian.\n\nHearing Ye Bin's rapid-fire questions, Ding Xiaoqian gave a helpless smile. \"Officer Ye, you're asking so many questions right off the bat, I don't know how to answer you.\"\n\n\"Let's take them one by one. Why did you suddenly ask me to meet you here?\" Ye Bin didn't think much of Ding Xiaoqian's words, merely believing he had spoken too quickly and she hadn't heard him clearly.\n\nFacing Ye Bin, who had zero emotional intelligence, Ding Xiaoqian gave a helpless wry smile.\n\n\"What? Am I still speaking too fast?\" Ye Bin asked, seeing Ding Xiaoqian's wry smile.\n\n\"It's fine, I heard you. I asked you to come here because I want to tell a story, and this story happened right here.\" Ding Xiaoqian said, turning to look at the two abandoned buildings behind her.\n\n\"A story?\"\n\n\"Mhm,\" Ding Xiaoqian nodded. \"I'll tell you everything you want to know.\"\n\nYe Bin didn't say anything upon hearing this, just nodded, and waited for Ding Xiaoqian to continue her story.\n\n\"It all started five years ago. In this residential area, there was a happy family of three. But due to a sudden accident, the happy family of three was broken apart.\"\n\n\"You're talking about the story of a little girl who died of heart disease.\" Hearing Ding Xiaoqian's words, Ye Bin guessed that the story Ding Xiaoqian was about to tell was likely the one he had heard from Ye He about a little girl who died of heart disease.\n\n\"It seems you already know that story.\" Ding Xiaoqian wasn't surprised that Ye Bin knew the story she was about to tell.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Ye Bin nodded, then looked at the two buildings behind Ding Xiaoqian. \"Was the little girl's home here?\"\n\n\"Mhm. How much do you know about this story?\"\n\n\"Everything. I also know that the cases that have occurred so far are likely the work of the little girl's father, right? I remember his father was a Taoist priest.\" Ye Bin didn't hold back, directly stating his judgment to Ding Xiaoqian.\n\n\"Why do you think so?\"\n\n\"After the little girl's accidental death five years ago, her father found a forbidden technique, 'Soul Reanimation.' To revive his daughter, the father sought out people born in a Yin year, Yin month, and Yin day to use as vessels, so his daughter could successfully return to life.\" Ye Bin recounted all his deductions so far.\n\nHearing Ye Bin's words, Ding Xiaoqian's expression remained very calm, showing no change due to what Ye Bin had said.\n\n\"What if I told you that everything you know is wrong?\" Ding Xiaoqian asked calmly, a smile flickering across her face.\n\n\"All wrong?\" Ye Bin's expression sank slightly. If all the deductions made so far were wrong, Ye Bin found it hard to imagine what their group's persistence had been for. \"If all my deductions are wrong, then what is the truth?\" Ye Bin asked coldly, questioning Ding Xiaoqian.\n\n\"I did it all. The little girl's father you mentioned, he was my benefactor. To repay his kindness, I wanted to save my benefactor's daughter, and that's why I committed so many sins.\" Ding Xiaoqian said with a smile, a sense of relief appearing on her face afterward.\n\nYe Bin remained silent, calmly looking at Ding Xiaoqian. After a long pause, Ye Bin spoke coldly, questioning her, \"Do you think I'll believe what you're saying?\"\n\n\"Believe it or not, it's the truth,\" Ding Xiaoqian said indifferently, a smile on her face.\n\n\"I don't want to hear your story anymore. I hope you understand that in this world, some things cannot be borne just because you wish to bear them. I will find out the truth. If it's really you, I will take you away.\" Ye Bin said in a deep voice, then turned to leave.\n\nWatching Ye Bin's retreating back, Ding Xiaoqian was momentarily stunned. The next moment, when Ding Xiaoqian came to her senses, she shouted towards Ye Bin, \"Ye Bin, can you please stop investigating? Everything is about to end! You can just take me back then! Okay!\" By the end of her plea, tears were streaming down Ding Xiaoqian's face.\n\nHearing Ding Xiaoqian's cries, Ye Bin's footsteps paused. He then turned around and looked at Ding Xiaoqian with a detached expression. \"As long as everything hasn't ended, I won't give up.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

For him, he just wanted to save his daughter.

Every single one of them carries sin!\"\n\n\"If they are guilty, the law will naturally punish them. It's not for others to act.\"\n\n\"The law? The law! Hahaha! This is the most laughable thing I've ever heard. I once saw a child whose parents were deceived and incurred debt. In the end, crushed by exorbitant interest, with no way out, the parents could only choose death. Only that six-year-old child was left. But in the end, the person who deceived the child's parents is still at large and will continue to deceive another family.

Will that day only come when those who have been oppressed pay the price with their lives? You are a police officer, you should know that there is no fairness in this world.

Survival of the fittest is the essence of this world.\" Ding Xiaoqian said, shaking her head, a cold smile appearing on her face. \"The most laughable thing in this world is when someone tells me that the world is fair.\"\n\n\"It seems you've been through a lot these past few years.\" Ye Bin spoke softly, a pang of heartache in his heart. From Ding Xiaoqian's words, it was clear that she must have endured so much over the years.\n\n\"Experience? Heh, experience. Do you know, I once saw a little boy die of illness on the street. He died in my arms. Even now, I still remember the last words he said to me.\"\n\n\"'Sister, I heard the adults say that if you die, you can go to another world. In that world, I won't be sick anymore.'\"\n\n\"'Perhaps, just a dose of medicine could have saved that little boy's life. But from beginning to end, no one, no one! offered him a helping hand. When I saw him, he was already...' \" Ding Xiaoqian said, her voice choked with emotion, her cheeks already soaked with tears.\n\nYe Bin stood there, calmly watching Ding Xiaoqian, seemingly without any emotional fluctuation at all concerning everything she had said.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" After a long pause, Ye Bin suddenly spoke, then bowed deeply to Ding Xiaoqian. After that, Ye Bin turned and left directly.\n\n\"If you continue to investigate, you will die! Aren't you afraid of death!\" Seeing that Ye Bin showed no signs of giving up, Ding Xiaoqian screamed with all her might, calling out to Ye Bin, who was about to leave.\n\n\"I am afraid.\" Ye Bin paused, turned, and gave Ding Xiaoqian a smile.\n\nThe moment she saw the smile on Ye Bin's face, Ding Xiaoqian was stunned. For some reason, at that moment, Ding Xiaoqian felt that Ye Bin's experiences seemed to be even more profound than her own. In that simple smile, there was a trace of world-weariness.\n\n\"You are right, this world is unfair, but isn't creating a fair world what we hope for? And doesn't the existence of law aim to make this unfair world fair? If all sins are only resolved by individuals, then wouldn't this world fall into chaos?\"\n\nAfter hearing Ye Bin's words, Ding Xiaoqian stood there, stunned. She wanted to retort, but she didn't know where to begin.\n\n\"Even if the person you speak of was for what they called justice, only killing those who carry sin, in the final analysis, he only wanted to save his daughter. For his own benefit, he trampled on other people's lives under the guise of a saint. Do you think, what difference is there between him and those who carry sin?\" Ye Bin's words were calm but extremely sharp.\n\n\"I never said he was right. I just hope that the person stopping him isn't you.\" Ding Xiaoqian wiped the tears from her face with her hand and said softly.\n\n\"I understand your good intentions, but I also hope you understand that someone has to stand up.\"\n\n\"But, everything is almost over. You don't need to chase after it anymore! As long as it's over! It won't happen again.\" Ding Xiaoqian spoke again, trying to persuade Ye Bin.\n\n\"I said before, I won't give up until it's over. Moreover, even if I give up, my friends won't. Before we started investigating this case, we had already given up everything. If we give up again, we will have nothing. What is the use of living for someone who has nothing?\" Ye Bin said, a self-mocking smile appearing on his face.\n\n\"Even if you don't give up and continue to investigate, you won't find anything!\" Seeing that Ye Bin showed no signs of giving up, Ding Xiaoqian changed her approach to persuade him.\n\n\"Up to now, haven't we found a lot? At least, we know who the killer is, and what the killer's objective is.\"\n\n\"It's different. You don't understand how terrifying he is.\"\n\n\"No matter how terrifying, can he be more terrifying than this world?\" Ye Bin smiled, causing Ding Xiaoqian to suddenly freeze. \"I have to go. Be careful yourself.\" Looking at the stunned Ding Xiaoqian, Ye Bin didn't say much more, turned, and left again.\n\n\"Aren't you taking me with you? By rights, I am an accomplice.\" Ding Xiaoqian asked in confusion. Based on her understanding of Ye Bin, he had always been just and impartial in law enforcement and should not have let her go.\n\n\"Until the case is clear, you are at most a suspect. If you are truly guilty, I will take you.\" Ye Bin said coldly, not answering, but instead walking directly through the overgrown grass and leaving.\n\n\"What are you thinking in your heart?\" Looking at Ye Bin's receding back, Ding Xiaoqian was somewhat lost. She really couldn't figure out what Ye Bin was thinking.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 158: The Passenger\n\nHaving recovered, Lin Xiao returned to the police station and immediately began investigating the abandoned factory.\n\n\"Brother Lin, this is all the data I could find regarding that 'abandoned factory',\" Fang Chen quickly compiled all materials related to the factory accident five years ago at Lin Xiao's command.\n\n\"Alright, I got it.\" Lin Xiao took the documents but didn't look at them, instead continuing to stare at the computer screen, seemingly investigating something.\n\n\"Oh, by the way, Brother Lin, who exactly is that woman named Lisa? I investigated her information, but I couldn't find much,\" Fang Chen had started investigating Lisa the moment he returned to the station, but apart from some basic information, he hadn't found much about her. It was precisely because of this that Fang Chen was suspicious of Lisa's identity.\n\n\"Don't worry about her for now. The most important thing is to thoroughly investigate that factory. Also, have you gotten any results from what I asked you to investigate a while ago?\" Lin Xiao shifted his gaze from the computer to Fang Chen, who was in front of his desk.\n\n\"No, apart from the clue about Li Yang from before, I haven't found any clues about Li Chao. However, Brother Lin, didn't that woman named Lisa capture Li Chao at the abandoned factory? Why would Li Chao appear at the abandoned factory? I can't quite understand this point,\" Fang Chen was still puzzled about Li Chao's appearance at the abandoned factory.\n\n\"I'm not entirely sure why Li Chao was at the abandoned factory either. However, the photo of Li Chao at the abandoned factory doesn't just show Li Chao, but also the 'Route 18' bus. So, I suspect that Li Chao's appearance at the abandoned factory is very likely related to the 'Route 18' bus, and I suspect Li Chao might have boarded that bus.\" Lin Xiao made a guess regarding Li Chao, believing that Li Chao's disappearance was very likely connected to the 'Route 18' bus.\n\n\"All the cases now revolve around this 'Route 18' bus. It seems that if we don't figure out the origin of this 'Route 18' bus, further investigation will likely be in vain,\" Fang Chen felt that the 'Route 18' bus was now the key to the case. Without understanding this key point, continued investigation would not yield much progress.\n\nLin Xiao nodded in agreement with Fang Chen's words. In fact, he also knew that the case began with the 'Route 18' bus, and to uncover the truth, he naturally had to understand the origin of the 'Route 18' bus.\n\n\"Just now, I cross-referenced all the 'Route 18' bus drivers to date, as well as the information of all the missing and deceased persons in the case so far. The birth dates of all the missing persons were all born in yin years, yin months, and yin hours. According to the previous investigation by Ye Bin and the others, the killer might be trying to 'borrow a corpse to return the soul,' and these missing persons are the vessels. As for all the victims, they also have commonalities,\" Lin Xiao said, turning the computer screen around.\n\nFang Chen looked at the list of victims Lin Xiao had compiled on the computer screen. At the end of the list, there was a notation.\n\n\"Curse.\"\n\n\"Regarding the 'curse,' didn't we already know about this?\" Fang Chen had heard Ye Bin talk about the \"curse\" a long time ago.\n\n\"The curse I'm talking about is not the one Ye Bin and the others investigated before. The curse Ye Bin and the others investigated was that everyone who saw the 'Route 18' bus would inexplicably die. However, through my investigation, I found that it's not people who saw the 'Route 18' bus who die inexplicably, but rather, all people who have ridden the 'Route 18' bus will die inexplicably.\"\n\n\"Ridden? Brother Lin means all the deceased were passengers on the 'Route 18' bus?\" Fang Chen said, a hint of surprise on his face. Although he didn't doubt what Lin Xiao said, he was very astonished.\n\n\"Yes.\" Lin Xiao nodded, then clicked the mouse, opening an image. \"I investigated all the surveillance footage of this 'Route 18' bus, and I found that all the deceased had ridden this 'Route 18' bus.\" Lin Xiao pointed to the photo on the computer screen, which was a surveillance image from inside the bus. In the surveillance footage, there was a boy about 15 years old, and that boy was the same young boy who died at the amusement park.\n\n\"But if that's the case, with so many passengers on the 'Route 18' bus, doesn't that mean everyone who rode that bus is cursed? If so, how many more people will die!\" Hearing Lin Xiao's words, Fang Chen shivered. Just thinking about it made him feel terrified.\n\n\"I haven't investigated this point clearly yet. I've only found that these people were all passengers on this 'Route 18' bus.\" In the investigation so far, Lin Xiao had only found this result after comparing all the victims, but why only these passengers were targeted, Lin Xiao had not yet figured out.\n\n\"If that's the case, then the 'curse' that Ye Bin and the others mentioned doesn't exist? But, I still have a question: was the fire in Hei Shui Village really just an accident? And also, those police officers investigating Hei Shui Village, they couldn't possibly have been passengers on the 'Route 18' bus, right?\" Fang Chen posed a series of questions.\n\n\"This is currently just a discovery of mine, and whether the inference from this discovery is true or not is still unknown. As you said, if we cannot clarify the origin of the 'Route 18' bus, it will indeed be difficult to make a breakthrough in the case.\" Lin Xiao had also considered the questions raised by Fang Chen, but with the clues currently available, he could not provide Fang Chen with answers to these questions.\n\n\"What is the origin of this 'Route 18' bus?\" Fang Chen pursed his lips, his mind feeling very chaotic at this moment. He had no clue about the 'Route 18' bus case.\n\n\"Tonight, I will go back to the villa to see if Ye Bin and the others have made any discoveries.\"\n\n\"Brother Lin, I'll accompany you back.\"\n\n\"No, there's still one more thing I need you to do. I need you to go to City Z and find someone for me.\"\n\n\"City Z?\"\n\n\"Yes, this person was a ticket seller on the 'Route 18' bus.\"\n\n\"Ticket seller?\"\n\n\"Yes, five years ago, the 'Route 18' bus had a ticket seller. Although the drivers of the 'Route 18' bus changed many times, there was only this one ticket seller. I've been investigating this ticket seller's whereabouts all along, and it was only today that I found her. She is in City Z. Currently, she is a kindergarten teacher.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "**Chapter 159: Kind-Hearted**\n\nAccording to Lin Xiao's information, Fang Chen went alone to City Z to find the sole ticket collector on the \"Route 18\" bus.\n\n\"Renbo Kindergarten, this should be it, no mistake.\" Following the address provided by Lin Xiao, Fang Chen found the kindergarten where the ticket collector resided.\n\nUpon arriving at the kindergarten, Fang Chen did not enter directly. Instead, he circled the perimeter of the kindergarten before approaching the main gate.\n\n\"Hello, excuse me, is Teacher Xue Ting here?\" Fang Chen inquired at the kindergarten's gatehouse, asking the guard on duty.\n\n\"Who are you?\" The guard, upon hearing Fang Chen's question, did not answer immediately. Instead, he sized Fang Chen up from head to toe, a wary expression on his face.\n\n\"Oh, it's like this, I'm the parent of Fang Yuxin. Teacher Xue Ting said the child has been a bit disruptive lately and wanted to talk to me, so I came.\" Fang Chen said with a smile, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a pack of cigarettes. He offered one to the guard. \"Children these days can be quite mischievous, and the teachers can't keep them in line, so they asked me to come check on the child.\" Fang Chen said, trying to ingratiate himself while lighting the guard's cigarette.\n\nThe guard, taking a puff of the cigarette, flashed Fang Chen a smile. His previous wariness had completely vanished. \"Ah, isn't that the truth? There are always a few children at school who like to act up. You're a parent of a student in Teacher Xue Ting's class, right? The teaching building is the third room on the left. That's Teacher Xue Ting's classroom. If Teacher Xue Ting isn't teaching, go upstairs, turn right on the third floor, and the first room is Teacher Xue Ting's office.\" The guard gave Fang Chen detailed directions, fearing he might not find Xue Ting.\n\n\"Alright, thank you for your trouble.\" Fang Chen said with a smile, then entered the kindergarten and followed the guard's directions to the teaching building. After entering, Fang Chen first located Xue Ting's class. Seeing that a male teacher was currently teaching, Fang Chen went directly to the third floor and found Xue Ting's office.\n\nThe door to Xue Ting's office was ajar. Peeking in, Fang Chen saw a woman in her mid-thirties sitting in the office and was fairly certain she was the Xue Ting the guard had mentioned.\n\n\"Hello! Is anyone there?\" Fang Chen gently knocked on the door and asked.\n\nXue Ting, who was working in her office, looked up when she heard the knock. \"Yes, please come in.\"\n\nFang Chen entered the office and, with a smile, asked, \"Hello, are you Teacher Xue Ting?\"\n\n\"Mmm, yes. And you are?\" Xue Ting, finding Fang Chen unfamiliar, guessed he was a parent of a student in her class.\n\n\"Hello, I'm Fang Chen.\" Fang Chen said with a smile, extending his right hand to Xue Ting.\n\n\"Mr. Fang, hello.\" Xue Ting instinctively reached out to shake Fang Chen's hand. At the same time, she was wondering if there was any student in her class with the surname Fang. \"Mr. Fang, is there something you need?\"\n\n\"I have something I'd like to ask Teacher Xue for help with.\" Fang Chen said with a smile.\n\n\"May I ask which student's parent you are, Mr. Fang? If there's something you need, just say it. I'll help if I can.\" Xue Ting asked tentatively, trying to figure out who Fang Chen was.\n\n\"Teacher Xue, I won't hide it from you any longer. I'm a police officer, and I've come to ask for your help in investigating a case.\" Fang Chen no longer concealed his identity, directly stating his origin. As he spoke, Fang Chen closed the door to Xue Ting's office.\n\nUpon hearing that Fang Chen was a police officer, Xue Ting's expression immediately darkened. She then said in a somewhat cold tone, \"I don't believe I've done anything illegal. What business do you have with me, Officer Fang? If there's nothing else, please leave. Otherwise, I'll have to ask the security guard downstairs to escort you out.\" Fang Chen had not expected Xue Ting to directly ask him to leave.\n\n\"Teacher Xue, please don't be agitated. Listen to me first.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say to the police,\" Xue Ting said coldly, unwilling to engage in further conversation. As she spoke, she reached for her phone on the desk.\n\n\"Teacher Xue, what I've come for is of great importance. I hope you can help me.\" Fang Chen said, stepping forward and snatching Xue Ting's phone.\n\nSeeing her phone snatched, Xue Ting's expression instantly turned grim. \"If you don't leave, I'm going to call for help,\" she said coldly, her gaze warily fixed on Fang Chen.\n\n\"Teacher Xue, please give me a chance to finish speaking, okay?\" Fang Chen said, putting on a pleading look.\n\nXue Ting frowned, looking at Fang Chen. Finally, her heart softened slightly. \"Speak. I'll give you five minutes. I have to go to class shortly.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Fang Chen smiled upon hearing this, then got straight to the point, directly asking Xue Ting, \"Teacher Xue, may I ask if you used to live in City X?\"\n\nHearing Fang Chen's question, Xue Ting's expression darkened again, as if she had thought of something. \"Mmm.\"\n\n\"Did you used to be a ticket collector?\" Fang Chen continued to probe.\n\nUpon hearing the words \"ticket collector,\" Xue Ting's face turned extremely grim. She then said coldly, \"Who are you! What exactly do you want to ask? I don't remember anything about City X anymore. If there's nothing else, please leave.\" Clearly, the events in City X seemed to have a significant impact on Xue Ting, causing her emotions to become agitated instantly.\n\n\"Teacher Xue, I think you've heard about what happened in City X. So far, many people have died. To prevent the situation from escalating further, I'd like to ask for your help.\" Fang Chen said calmly.\n\nAfter hearing Fang Chen's words, Xue Ting's expression softened somewhat, and her agitated demeanor gradually calmed down. \"I'm sorry, I can't help with what happened in City X. Besides, my memories from that time are already quite hazy,\" Xue Ting said faintly, politely declining Fang Chen.\n\n\"Teacher Xue, I can see that you are a kind-hearted person. So many people have been harmed already. If this continues, who knows how many more will be victimized.\" From their brief exchange, Fang Chen had discerned that Xue Ting was a very kind-hearted person, so he exploited this aspect to persuade her.\n\n\"I have my own family now. I just want to live a peaceful life. I hope you can stop bothering me.\" Xue Ting said, then sighed softly. \"I don't want to talk about what happened in City X anymore. I hope you can understand.\"\n\nHearing Xue Ting's words, Fang Chen nodded. He didn't say anything further but turned to leave. \"I'm sorry for the disturbance.\" Fang Chen did not force Xue Ting, but he also did not give up, believing that with Xue Ting's kind nature, she would not stand idly by.\n\nSeeing Fang Chen about to leave, Xue Ting's heart began to waver. In the end, she couldn't bring herself to be heartless and called out to Fang Chen. \"Wait a moment.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Fang Chen paused and turned to look at Xue Ting. \"Teacher Xue, is there something else?\"\n\n\"What do you want to ask? I only know a few things, not much.\" Xue Ting turned her head and said softly, still pondering whether what she was doing was right.\n\n\"I won't make things difficult for you, Teacher Xue. I just have a few questions. Once I've asked them, I'll leave and won't bother you again.\" Fang Chen did not want to involve her in the case.\n\n\"Alright, ask away then.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 160: Indifference\n\nA bus stopped by the roadside, and two thugs with tattoos all over their arms boarded. As soon as they got on, the two thugs looked around the bus with shifty eyes, as if searching for something.\n\n\"Hello, please pay the fare,\" the ticket seller said with a smile when she saw the two thugs get on without paying.\n\n\"Pay the fare? What fare? We paid when we got on! What, didn't you see? Trying to extort money?\" One of the thugs, wearing a yellow vest, tilted his head and said menacingly.\n\n\"Uh, sorry, I didn't see you pay,\" the ticket seller replied with a smile. However, due to the thug's fierce expression, the ticket seller was now afraid, and her voice was very quiet.\n\n\"Huh? Didn't see it? Are you blind! Are you looking for trouble! You damn woman, trying to extort money from me and my buddy, are you looking for a beating!\" The other thug, dressed in hip-hop attire, glared at the ticket seller and said angrily.\n\n\"I...\" The ticket seller wanted to say something, but the thugs' menacing expressions scared her into silence.\n\nMany passengers on the bus had actually seen that the two thugs had not paid, but no one wanted to get into trouble, so they chose to remain silent. After all, both thugs had extendable batons tucked into their waists, and at a time like this, no one wanted to court disaster.\n\n\"What? Have you remembered? Did my buddy pay?\" the hip-hop thug said, and he casually grabbed the extendable baton at his waist.\n\n\"Yes.\" The ticket seller lowered her head. At this moment, she could only endure. After all, no one on the bus was supporting her, and if she provoked the two thugs, she would surely be in great danger.\n\nAs the two thugs swaggered to the middle of the bus, the bus started and continued its journey. Along the way, all the passengers kept their distance from the two thugs, afraid of attracting their attention.\n\nThe bus traveled for two stops. When it stopped at the third stop, a little girl in a black dress, holding a doll, boarded the bus. When the ticket seller saw the little girl, she curiously looked outside the door, as it seemed no parents were following the girl.\n\n\"Little one, where are your parents?\" the ticket seller asked the girl kindly, thinking the girl had gotten separated from her parents.\n\n\"Daddy is at work, and Mommy is sick today and waiting for me at home. I'm going home by myself. Auntie, here is my money,\" the little girl said with a innocent and cute smile, then handed her change to the ticket seller.\n\n\"Oh, do you know the way home by yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes, I get off two stops from here and it's my home,\" the little girl pouted and said, pointing ahead with her finger.\n\n\"Okay, you can sit here with me. The bus is bumpy, be careful you don't fall.\" The ticket seller said, getting up from her seat, intending to help the little girl to her seat. However, just as the ticket seller left her seat, the thug in the yellow vest who was standing in the middle of the bus suddenly stepped forward and pushed the ticket seller aside, sitting in her seat.\n\n\"Not bad! There's a seat here. Brother! Come on, let's squeeze in here.\" The yellow-vested thug said, waving to his companion.\n\nThe hip-hop thug smiled slightly, stepped forward, and squeezed into the ticket seller's seat with the yellow-vested thug. \"Standing for so long, it's really tiring, this is great!\" the hip-hop thug chuckled, then cocked his neck and looked arrogant.\n\nSeeing this, the ticket seller's face instantly darkened. The anger she had felt earlier, combined with the current anger, made the fear in her heart disappear in an instant, leaving only rage. \"What are you two doing! This is my seat!\" the ticket seller glared at the two thugs and shouted directly.\n\n\"Oh! You damn woman, you're being bossy. I said this is my seat, what about it, not allowed!\" The yellow-vested thug jumped down from the seat and walked up to the ticket seller, glaring at her fiercely.\n\n\"You're going too far!\" the ticket seller gritted her teeth and said.\n\n\"We are going too far! So what? Do you want to fight? Or are you looking for a beating?\" The hip-hop thug also jumped down from the seat, and the atmosphere on the bus instantly became tense.\n\n\"Don't worry, Auntie, I won't sit. I can stand. Don't argue with them.\" The little girl gently tugged on the ticket seller's clothes, her voice trembling slightly.\n\n\"Don't be afraid, little one, Auntie is here! It's okay.\" The ticket seller quickly crouched down, gently stroking the little girl's head, and gave her a kind smile.\n\nAnd just as the ticket seller crouched down, the hip-hop thug deliberately stumbled towards her, pushing her to the ground.\n\n\"What do you want!\" Pushed to the ground, the ticket seller finally exploded. She got up from the ground, her eyes fixed on the two thugs, her face full of anger.\n\n\"Are you TM blind! Don't you have eyes, you stepped on my shoes and got them dirty. These shoes cost over a thousand yuan, hurry up and pay, or I'll kill you today!\" The hip-hop thug pointed at his shoe and said viciously.\n\n\"You're lying, you pushed Auntie!\" the little girl beside them pouted, pointing her little finger at the hip-hop thug as she spoke.\n\n\"Get the hell out of here!\" The yellow-vested thug reached out to slap the little girl. If the ticket seller hadn't moved forward to take the slap for the little girl, there would have definitely been a handprint on the little girl's face.\n\n\"You two beasts! You hit a child! Are you even human!\" The ticket seller's face burned with pain, but her heart ached even more. She never imagined that there were such wicked people in the world who wouldn't even spare a little girl.\n\n\"You damn woman, what did you say!\" The yellow-vested thug directly drew the extendable baton from his waist and struck the ticket seller.\n\nThe ticket seller could have dodged it, but fearing that the thugs would harm the little girl, she hugged the little girl, allowing the yellow-vested thug to hit her.\n\nSeeing the yellow-vested thug attack, the hip-hop thug was not to be outdone. He also drew his extendable baton and, like his companion, struck the ticket seller.\n\nThe beating lasted for nearly two minutes. Blood seeped from the ticket seller's forehead, and her whole body was covered in wounds. Seeing blood on the ticket seller's head, the two thugs realized the situation was getting serious. After giving the ticket seller a kick each, they ran off the bus.\n\nDuring the two minutes of beating, no one on the bus offered any help. The little girl cried, shouting \"Help!\", but throughout, no one dared to utter a sound.\n\n\"Auntie! Auntie!\" Looking at the ticket seller lying in a pool of blood, the little girl's face was drenched in tears. \"You bad people! Why didn't you help Auntie! Why didn't you help Auntie!\" the little girl cried, looking at the indifferent crowd around her, feeling very scared.\n\nAbout ten minutes later, an ambulance arrived and took the injured ticket seller away. During this time, the passengers on the bus just stood there, and no one stepped forward to offer any help to the ticket seller. Some were still discussing the ticket seller.\n\n\"This person is really foolish! Those two thugs obviously looked like trouble, and she still confronted them. Isn't she asking for trouble?\"\n\n\"Exactly! So foolish! Courting disaster!\"\n\nOn the bus, the little girl heard the discussions in the crowd. She clenched her little fists, then pointed at the crowd and roared, \"Bad people! You bad people! You are all bad people!\"\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "「那件事發生過後沒多久，X市發生了很多起事故，而在那些事故當中死去的人，有當時的公交司機，以及之前的那兩名小混混，還有一些我能記起來的乘客。」講完故事後，薛婷低下頭，小聲說道。\n\n聽完薛婷的敘述，方晨大致有了猜測。「妳知道那個小女孩已經去世了嗎？」\n\n「嗯。」薛婷微微點頭。「一開始我並不知道，只是覺得事情有些奇怪，但是，當我知道那個小女孩意外去世後，我心中便有了個猜想，那些人死，很有可能與小女孩有關。」薛婷低著頭，沒有抬頭面對方晨，此刻她覺得自己身負罪孽。\n\n「事情發生之後，妳有再見過那個小女孩嗎？」方晨沒有理會薛婷的話，繼續詢問。\n\n薛婷搖搖頭。「沒有。」\n\n「妳為什麼離開X市？是因為害怕嗎？」\n\n聽到方晨再次詢問，薛婷抬起頭，直視著方晨。「我沒有害怕，我離開，只是……」話到嘴邊，薛婷最終沒有說出口。\n\n「那件事情之後，我便辭了工作，換了一份新的工作，原本我以為一切都結束了，但是，一天夜裡，我在夢中見到了那個小女孩……」說到這裡，薛婷眉頭微皺，陷入回憶。\n\n方晨沒有打斷，只是靜靜地等待。\n\n過了許久，薛婷似乎想起了一切，再次開口敘述。「那天夜裡，我夢到了那個小女孩，她依舊是穿著一身黑色的連衣裙，當時，她一直朝著我笑，一邊笑，她還一邊開口感謝我，感謝我當初為她所做的一切，原本，那個夢還是很溫馨的，我對於在夢中見到那個小女孩也是感到十分開心的，可是……」說到這裡，薛婷突然雙手抱在胸前，身體不由自主地打了一個冷顫。\n\n看到薛婷此刻的樣子，方晨目光一凝，顯然，薛婷之後的夢境中，似乎出現了什麼可怕的變故。\n\n「她朝我感謝之後，便是轉身離去，可是，當她轉身離開的時候，我看到她的手裡，拎著一個血淋淋的東西，當我看到那血淋淋的東西時，我一輩子都不會忘記，那是一顆人頭，一顆血淋淋的人頭，當時，那人頭的兩隻眼睛睜開，朝著我露出了一個猙獰的笑容。」薛婷說完，大口喘息著，顯然，夢境中的那一幕，直到現在也無法讓她釋懷。\n\n「你看清楚，那顆人頭是誰了嗎？」方晨皺著眉頭，試探著問道。\n\n「是那兩個小混混其中的一個。」薛婷顫抖著回答，額頭上已冒出冷汗。「第二天醒來之後，我害怕極了，當我從新聞上看到之前的那兩個小混混意外身亡之後，我……我便帶著我的家人，離開了X市。」\n\n「在那之後，妳還夢到過那個小女孩嗎？」\n\n「在我離開X市的那一晚，我又夢到了那個小女孩，那時候，她在和我揮手告別，從那以後，我就再也沒有夢到過那個小女孩了。」\n\n「薛老師，多謝您的幫忙。」等薛婷講完，方晨起身準備離開。\n\n見方晨要走，薛婷突然開口喊住了他。「方警官，請問，X市的那些案件，真的與那個小女孩有關嗎？」這些年來，薛婷一直關注著X市的事，但當年之事，她始終沒有向任何人提起，就連當年離開X市，她也是欺騙家人說是在Z市找到了一份很好的工作。\n\n「案子還沒有調查清楚，但是，根據我們現在所掌握的線索，與她，有著直接的聯繫。」方晨沒有對薛婷隱瞞。\n\n「這麼說，真的是她回來報仇了嗎？」薛婷咬著嘴唇，有些害怕地開口。\n\n「如果只是單純的報仇的話，如今，已經死去了太多的人了。」方晨沉聲說道，目光有些冰冷地看向薛婷。\n\n「作惡，就是要付出代價的！」薛婷突然咬牙，有些憤怒地說道，一想到當年自己在公車上被毒打的兩分鐘，沒有一個人站出來，薛婷便對這個世界感到心寒。\n\n「妳也有家人了吧？妳應該知道，他們也是有家人的，雖然他們做出了錯誤的選擇，但是，他們的錯，還不至於死，如今，那些人死去，年邁的老人失去了唯一的兒子，剛剛結婚的妻子，失去了終身的伴侶，剛上小學的孩子，成為了單親家庭，難道，他們也有錯嗎？」方晨冷冷地說道，目光有些陰沉地注視著薛婷。「身為父母，妳應該知道，孩子對於父母的重要性，身為妻子，妳也應該清楚，丈夫對於妻子的重要性，最後，身為一名老師，妳也應該明白，家長，在孩子們心中的重要性。這其中，失去了任何一個人，家，就垮了！」\n\n方晨說完，便離開了薛婷的辦公室，薛婷則愣在原地，腦海中不斷迴盪著方晨的話，陷入沉思。\n\n「喂，林哥，我找到了薛婷，關於『18路』公車的事情以及那個小女孩的事情，我也了解到了。」離開幼兒園後，方晨第一時間撥通了林驍的電話，隨後將自己聽到的故事，一五一十地敘述給林驍。\n\n「好，事情我都知道了，先趕回X市吧，一路小心。」\n\n「嗯。」簡短的交流後，方晨掛斷電話，離開Z市，趕回X市。\n\n「媽媽？妳今天怎麼一直發呆？是不開心嗎？」薛婷回到家後，女兒摟著她的胳膊，歪著頭關切地問道。\n\n「是啊，妳今天回來就一直發呆，是在幼兒園遇到不講理的家長了嗎？」薛婷的丈夫也有些擔心地問道。\n\n聽到女兒和丈夫的詢問，薛婷頓時一愣，腦海裡再次浮現出方晨對自己說的那段話。\n\n「這其中，失去了任何一個人，家，就垮了！」\n\n「謝謝你們！」看著女兒和丈夫，此刻的薛婷終於明白了方晨話語的含義，隨即，她張開雙臂，抱住女兒和丈夫，嚎啕大哭了起來。\n\n「爸爸，媽媽這是怎麼了？」女兒一臉迷茫地看向薛婷的丈夫，疑惑地問道。\n\n薛婷的丈夫一臉無奈。「爸爸也不知道啊。」\n\n(本章完)",

    "content": "Chapter 162: Lu Qianhang Awakens\n\n“Dad, why is my name ‘Lu Qianhang’? Does it mean you want me to ‘go forward’?” the innocent little boy asked softly, his arm linked with his father’s.\n\nThe little boy’s father didn’t answer. He gently stroked the boy’s head and then looked into the distance.\n\n“Dad, did you make a mistake when you named me? Are you sure it’s not ‘Lu Qianxing’?” Seeing his father’s silence, the boy asked again.\n\n“There are many roads in this world. Dad hopes you won’t walk the same path as Dad,” the boy’s father said, stroking his son’s head with a smile.\n\n“The same road as Dad? Did Dad get lost?” The little boy tilted his head, guessing.\n\n“Yes, Dad got lost. If Dad had another chance, he would never get lost again,” the boy’s father said, shaking his head slightly, a hint of sadness on his face.\n\n“Dad.” In a daze, Lu Qianhang saw a figure. It was a very familiar figure. With just one glance, Lu Qianhang recognized it as his father.\n\nLu Qianhang reached out, trying desperately to grab that figure, but no matter how hard he tried, the figure didn’t get closer. Instead, it moved further and further away until it disappeared.\n\n“Dad!” With a roar, Lu Qianhang woke up from his daze. He was lying in bed, his hand reaching towards the ceiling, tears streaming down his cheeks.\n\nOutside the room, hearing Lu Qianhang’s roar, everyone was startled. Then, they rushed into Lu Qianhang’s room at the fastest speed possible.\n\n“Qianhang! You’re awake!” Ye Bin was the first to enter the room. Seeing Lu Qianhang awake, Ye Bin let out a sigh of relief, a look of relief on his face.\n\n“Are you okay, kid! You really had us worried!” Zhang Lan’s face also showed relief. Seeing Lu Qianhang awake, his heart finally settled.\n\nSeeing everyone looking at him with concern, Lu Qianhang sat up, wiped the tears from his eyes, and then smiled at them. “Sorry for making you worry, I’m fine.”\n\n“If you’re fine, why are you crying! What’s wrong? Are you too excited to see us!” Zhang Lan noticed the tears in Lu Qianhang’s eyes and immediately joked.\n\nAt Zhang Lan’s words, everyone’s worry deepened.\n\n“Qianhang, are you really okay? What happened? Why does your face look a little unwell?” Ning Hua examined Lu Qianhang, noticing that his complexion was a bit pale.\n\n“You must be starving, that’s why you’re so pale. Wait here, I’ll order you some takeout!” Zhao Zhen said, turning and leaving the room to order takeout for Lu Qianhang.\n\n“Qianhang, is there anything wrong with your body?” Although Lu Qianhang was awake, Ye Bin was worried if there were any issues with his body.\n\n“I’m fine, don’t worry everyone. I just slept for too long and my head hurts a little,” Lu Qianhang said, holding his head with his hand.\n\n“Let’s get up and move around to get your meridians flowing,” Old Xu said, stepping forward to help Lu Qianhang off the bed.\n\nAfter being unconscious for a long time, Lu Qianhang almost fell when he stood up. If not for Old Xu and Ye Bin supporting him, he would have fallen to the ground.\n\n“Are you okay?”\n\n“I’m fine. Maybe I haven’t exercised in a long time, and my legs are a bit numb. They feel much better now.” Lu Qianhang said, lifting his leg as he spoke.\n\n“It’s good that you’re okay. When Old Zhao gets the food, you should eat something to recover your strength. Your body is too weak right now.”\n\nAbout half an hour later, Zhao Zhen’s takeout arrived.\n\nTo ensure that Lu Qianhang, who had been unconscious for a long time, could have a good meal, Zhao Zhen spared no expense and ordered a very lavish spread.\n\n“Old Zhao, you’re usually so stingy, but I didn’t expect you to be quite generous at a crucial moment.” Old Xu had always thought of Zhao Zhen as a miser, so ordering so much delicious food at once was a bit of a surprise.\n\n“Go away! Who’s stingy? I call it saving money,” Zhao Zhen retorted, glaring at Old Xu.\n\n“It’s called saving money when you say it nicely, but it’s just being stingy when you say it plainly. Stop arguing,” Zhang Lan gave Zhao Zhen no room to argue and added.\n\n“Fatty Lan, shut up. What do you know? If I’m stingy, I’m an iron rooster, but you’re a sugar rooster,” Zhao Zhen retorted, not to be outdone by Zhang Lan.\n\n“What does ‘sugar rooster’ mean?” Chen Hui scratched his head, confused by Zhao Zhen’s words.\n\n“An iron rooster doesn’t give away a single feather, but a sugar rooster not only doesn’t give away a feather but also takes from others,” Ning Hua explained to Chen Hui.\n\nAfter Ning Hua’s explanation, Chen Hui instantly understood and then forced an awkward smile. “He really is stingy.”\n\n“You brat, who are you calling stingy!” Zhang Lan glared fiercely at Chen Hui and said coldly.\n\n“Hahaha!” Seeing Zhang Lan’s outburst, everyone burst into laughter. Then, they started eating and chatting happily. When they had eaten most of the food and everyone was slumped in their chairs, Old Xu suddenly spoke, asking about the reason for Lu Qianhang’s coma.\n\n“Speaking of which, Qianhang, what exactly happened in that abandoned residential complex?”\n\nAfter Old Xu spoke, everyone’s gaze focused on Lu Qianhang. They were all as curious as Old Xu.\n\nUpon hearing Old Xu’s words, Lu Qianhang frowned slightly, his mind trying to recall what happened before he lost consciousness. However, Lu Qianhang was feeling a headache now, and his memory of the events was somewhat vague.\n\n“I can’t remember the specifics clearly. I only remember that while investigating in that complex, I felt a sense of oppression, and soon after, I lost consciousness. Then, my consciousness seemed to be trapped in a dark space until I saw my father’s back. I reached out towards my father’s back, and that’s when I woke up.”\n\nAlthough Lu Qianhang had been unconscious for several days in everyone else’s eyes, it felt like only a short time had passed for him.\n\n“A sense of oppression? Was there something in that complex?” Zhao Zhen frowned, remembering the chill he felt behind him when they were trapped in that complex back then.\n\n“Yes, you suddenly got a fever and then passed out. You were unconscious for many days afterward. Could it be that you encountered something unclean?” Ning Hua felt that the matter was not that simple.\n\nLu Qianhang merely shook his head, “It shouldn’t be. I checked thoroughly when we were in that complex, and there was nothing there.” Lu Qianhang was very sure of this.\n\n“But if it was just a coincidence, it’s too much of a coincidence, isn’t it?” Zhang Lan shared Ning Hua’s opinion, also feeling that the matter was not that simple and that there might be something in that abandoned complex.\n\n“Speaking of which, how did you guys get out in the end?” Before he finally lost consciousness, Lu Qianhang vaguely remembered that they seemed to be lost and trapped in the abandoned complex.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 163 Curse?",
    "content": "Chapter 163: Curse?\n\nAfter Lu Qianxing woke up, Ye Bin first briefly inquired about Lu Qianxing's sudden fainting. Then, Ye Bin narrated the series of recent events in detail to Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"The perpetrator of the 'Route 18' bus case can be basically identified. It should be the father of the little girl who died unexpectedly five years ago. However, what remains unconfirmed is whether the little girl's father is human or a ghost. Besides this, there's the case that happened at the police station. The way the deceased in the police station and the four students from Yunxiang High School died is very bizarre, so it's highly probable that the perpetrators of these two cases are not the same as the perpetrator of the 'Route 18' bus case,\" Lu Qianxing summarized after hearing Ye Bin's account.\n\n\"Mm, both cases we are currently facing are quite strange, especially the cases at the police station and Yunxiang High School. The deceased at the crime scenes have bite marks on their bodies.\" The others had no questions about Lu Qianxing's summary.\n\n\"Are the bodies still at the police station?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Let's go to the police station to see the bodies first. Perhaps we can discover something.\" Lu Qianxing felt that they might find some clues from the deceased at the police station.\n\n\"Are we leaving right now? You just woke up. You should rest properly. We'll head out tomorrow morning.\" Lu Qianxing's complexion wasn't very good at the moment, and Ye Bin was worried that Lu Qianxing might have some issues, so he didn't rush Lu Qianxing to investigate at the police station.\n\n\"It's better to act sooner rather than later. Let's investigate as early as possible. Besides, I'm fine now. I've rested enough these past few days. If I rest any longer, my body will probably go to waste,\" Lu Qianxing said, a helpless smile appearing on his face.\n\nUpon hearing Lu Qianxing's words, Ye Bin thought for a moment, but ultimately agreed with Lu Qianxing, as he himself knew that time was running out for their group.\n\n\"Binzi and Fatty Lan will stay. I'll contact the police. We'll set off now.\" Old Xu said, taking out his phone and calling Zheng Tian.\n\n\"You're coming over now? Alright, I'll be waiting for you at the police station.\"\n\nAfter Old Xu hung up the phone, everyone, except for Ye Bin and Zhang Lan, prepared to leave for the police station to investigate. Just as they were about to head out, they coincidentally encountered Lin Xiao, who was returning to the villa.\n\n\"Detective Lin!\" Seeing Lin Xiao, everyone was taken aback, a hint of surprise flashing across their faces.\n\n\"Mm, where are you all going?\" Lin Xiao asked calmly, scanning everyone. When Lin Xiao saw Lu Qianxing, he was also somewhat surprised.\n\n\"Qianxing just woke up, so we want to rush to the police station to investigate,\" Old Xu explained. \"Speaking of which, Detective Lin, why did you come back so suddenly? Is something the matter?\" Usually, Lin Xiao would contact them by phone. His sudden return made Old Xu feel that Lin Xiao must have encountered something that couldn't be explained over the phone, which was why he rushed back.\n\n\"I've found some new clues regarding the 'Route 18' bus case, and I want to discuss them with you.\" Lin Xiao said calmly.\n\n\"What clues!\" Hearing Lin Xiao's words, everyone's gaze sharpened.\n\n\"It's about the 'curse' you mentioned earlier. However, it's not something that can be explained clearly in a short time. You should go to the police station to investigate first. I'll wait here for you to return.\"\n\nAlthough Old Xu and his group were very curious about what new clues Lin Xiao had found at this moment, they didn't inquire further. Instead, the group drove away from the villa and headed to the police station for the investigation.\n\nAfter Old Xu and his group left, the remaining Ye Bin and Zhang Lan started a conversation with Lin Xiao.\n\n\"Detective Lin's new clue is related to the 'curse.' What does that mean?\" Ye Bin was the first to ask Lin Xiao.\n\n\"Here's the information I found. You can take a look first,\" Lin Xiao said, pulling a USB drive from his pocket and handing it to Ye Bin.\n\nYe Bin took the USB drive, nodded without saying anything, and then plugged it into the computer.\n\nAfter opening the USB drive on the computer, it contained some videos and photos. Ye Bin first opened a photo, and when he saw a boy around 15 years old appear in the picture, Ye Bin's gaze instantly focused. Then, Ye Bin continued to scroll through the photos.\n\n\"Are these photos of all the deceased?\" After browsing through the other photos, Ye Bin discovered that all of them showed victims related to the 'Route 18' bus.\n\n\"These photos seem to be from the bus's surveillance footage. Could it be the 'Route 18' bus?\" Zhang Lan, standing beside him, noticed that all the photos appeared to be from the bus's surveillance footage.\n\n\"All the deceased were passengers on the 'Route 18' bus,\" Ye Bin murmured, making a guess. \"If that's the case, then the 'curse' we talked about earlier isn't that people who see the 'Route 18' bus contract the 'curse,' but rather that all passengers on the 'Route 18' bus contract the 'curse.'\" Looking at the photos on the computer screen, Ye Bin suddenly understood.\n\n\"How is that possible! If that's the case, then wouldn't all the victims have been passengers on the 'Route 18' bus? There are so many people in Heishui Village, did everyone ride the 'Route 18' bus? What about the police officers who went to Heishui Village to investigate before, and the police officers who investigated the accident five years ago? Were they also passengers on the 'Route 18' bus? Moreover, the most important thing is, if it's true that all passengers on the 'Route 18' bus will be cursed, then wouldn't even more people die!\" The thought that all passengers on the 'Route 18' bus would mysteriously die from a curse made Zhang Lan feel that the matter was a bit too absurd, after all, the number of passengers on a bus was countless.\n\n\"Could there be specific conditions? For example, passengers at a particular time, or because of a certain event, these passengers contract the 'curse'?\" Ye Bin murmured, then turned his gaze to Lin Xiao.\n\nLin Xiao, at this moment, was calmly watching Ye Bin and Zhang Lan. When he heard Ye Bin's question, Lin Xiao slowly spoke, \"Officer Ye has a very keen sense. I've already sent Fang Chen to Z City to investigate a ticket seller on the 'Route 18' bus. This ticket seller is the only survivor who saw the little girl. Therefore, I suspect that she should know something about the 'Route 18' bus case.\" Lin Xiao said, pointing to a video on the computer screen.\n\nSeeing this, Ye Bin directly clicked on the video.\n\nWhen the video opened, it showed surveillance footage from inside a bus. Many people were surrounding a woman lying on the ground. Among them, two men were punching and kicking the fallen woman. Behind the fallen woman was a little girl wearing a black dress. The moment Ye Bin saw the little girl, he immediately recognized her as the same little girl he had seen in the Bronze Hall in Heishui Village back then.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 164: Absolute",
    "content": "Chapter 164: Stubbornness\n\nHurrying along, Old Xu and his group arrived at the police station in the shortest possible time. Zheng Tian was already waiting at the entrance.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, you're here,\" Zheng Tian said as he quickly went up to greet Old Xu.\n\n\"You've been waiting outside for a long time, I'm really sorry to keep troubling you,\" Old Xu said with an apologetic expression. They had troubled Zheng Tian quite a bit recently, and Old Xu felt bad about it.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, what are you saying? You've been running back and forth for our station's case. If anyone is to be troubled, it should be me bothering you,\" Zheng Tian said, scratching his head with an awkward smile.\n\nSeeing this, Old Xu didn't say anything more. Instead, he stepped forward and gently patted Zheng Tian's shoulder. \"You've worked hard during this time. Once the case is closed, Uncle Xu will treat you to a big meal out of his own pocket.\"\n\n\"Okay, then I'll thank Uncle Xu in advance.\"\n\nAfter that, Old Xu briefly introduced Lu Qianxing to Zheng Tian, and then, led by Zheng Tian, they proceeded to the crime scene.\n\n\"Little Brother Lu, this is the crime scene. Uncle Xu should have already briefed you on the details of the case. We've investigated the crime scene countless times during this period, but we still haven't found any clues,\" Zheng Tian said, shaking his head helplessly.\n\n\"Mmm,\" Lu Qianxing nodded, not saying much. Instead, his gaze swept across the crime scene, as if searching for something.\n\nAfter a while, Lu Qianxing's expression suddenly sank. He then looked at Zheng Tian beside him and asked, \"Where is the victim?\"\n\n\"The victim is over here,\" Zheng Tian said, pulling out the victim's body from a nearby morgue drawer.\n\nAfter lifting the victim's body from the morgue drawer, Zheng Tian unzipped the body bag. The body was then fully revealed to Lu Qianxing.\n\nLu Qianxing carefully observed the body. When he saw the marks on the body that looked like they had been torn by something, his expression immediately turned grim.\n\nSeeing Lu Qianxing's demeanor, Old Xu and the others realized that Lu Qianxing must have discovered something.\n\n\"Qianxing? What's wrong? Did you find something?\" Old Xu asked quietly, sounding a little anxious.\n\n\"If my judgment is correct, the killer is likely not human,\" Lu Qianxing replied to Old Xu with a stern face and a cold tone.\n\nHearing Lu Qianxing's words, everyone present was stunned. Zheng Tian, in particular, was bewildered when he heard that the killer wasn't human.\n\n\"What do you mean, the killer isn't human?\" Zheng Tian had heard Old Xu and his group mention \"zombies\" before. Now, hearing Lu Qianxing's words, he felt that things were heading in a terrifying direction.\n\n\"Little Tian, we can't keep this from you any longer. You should already know about the recent 'Route 18' bus case. The case involves 'supernatural' events, and many things cannot be explained. Investigating this case will be dangerous, so you need to make a choice now. If possible, I don't want you to get involved in this case,\" Old Xu said earnestly to Zheng Tian.\n\nHearing Old Xu's words, Zheng Tian also frowned. Although he had suspected that the case was related to \"supernatural\" events before, he had only half-believed it without confirmation. Now, after hearing Old Xu, he could truly confirm that this case was different from previous ones and involved unknown aspects.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, although I'm a bit timid, I don't want to back down at a time like this,\" Zheng Tian replied to Old Xu.\n\n\"Kid, some things aren't as simple as you think. We are facing truly terrifying entities. A slight mistake could lead to your disappearance. You are still young, and you have a long life ahead of you. Since you are not yet involved, I think you should leave,\" Zhao Zhen advised Zheng Tian in the most straightforward way, urging him not to get involved.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, I have a question. If what you're saying is true, then Officer Ye isn't the killer, right?\" Zheng Tian ignored Zhao Zhen's words and suddenly asked Old Xu.\n\n\"Mmm,\" Old Xu simply nodded, not saying anything more. In fact, after Zheng Tian asked his question about Ye Bin, Old Xu understood that Zheng Tian would not back down.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, I have a general understanding of the case now, so I'm already considered involved. It wouldn't make any sense to withdraw now, would it?\" Zheng Tian said, showing Old Xu a very determined smile.\n\nLooking at the smile on Zheng Tian's face, Old Xu didn't speak. Instead, he turned his gaze to Lu Qianxing beside him. \"Qianxing, continue with your analysis.\"\n\n\"Old Xu, there are already enough people involved,\" Zhao Zhen said anxiously, but Old Xu stopped him with a raised hand halfway through his sentence.\n\n\"Didn't we make a choice before as well?\"\n\n\"But this is different!\" Zhao Zhen said, frowning.\n\n\"Uncle Zhao, I know you're doing this for me, but if I were to escape at this moment, I might regret it for the rest of my life. I don't want to live my life in regret,\" Zheng Tian said with a smile, reaffirming his resolve to Zhao Zhen.\n\n\"You kid, you don't understand! What we are facing! Even if you don't think for yourself, you should consider your family!\" Zhao Zhen didn't give up trying to persuade Zheng Tian and still didn't want him to get involved.\n\n\"Uncle Zhao, I grew up in an orphanage.\" Zheng Tian smiled awkwardly, a hint of helplessness crossing his face.\n\nHearing Zheng Tian's words, Zhao Zhen was stunned. He wanted to say something more but couldn't find the words.\n\n\"A person's life is full of choices. Some choices are made to escape, but for me, there's nothing left to escape from,\" Zheng Tian said, a calm smile on his face.\n\n\"You young people, sometimes I really can't understand what you're thinking! You have better choices, so why be so stubborn?\" Zhao Zhen said, shaking his head and sighing. He chose not to persuade Zheng Tian any further.\n\n\"Good choices may exist, but they are not what I want. And often, the seemingly worst choice is what I want the most. To go against one's true feelings and choose the best option often leaves only lifelong regret. To be human is to live without regret.\"\n\n\"Kid, your thoughts are good, but sometimes the price you pay is too great.\" Zhao Zhen looked at Zheng Tian and shook his head again. He still couldn't understand Zheng Tian's way of thinking.\n\n\"Old Zhao, if you were in Little Tian's place, what would you choose?\" Old Xu suddenly asked, looking at Zhao Zhen.\n\n\"I...\" Zhao Zhen was stunned by Old Xu's sudden question. After a long moment, he shook his head, a helpless smile appearing on his face.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 165 The lost soul",
    "content": "Chapter 165: The Soul Lost Long Ago\n\n\"You said earlier that a corpse disappeared from here, right?\" After carefully examining the deceased and the crime scene, Lu Qianxing turned to face Old Xu and his group.\n\n\"Yes, a corpse did disappear from here inexplicably. At first, we thought it was 'Ding Xiaoqian,' but later 'Ding Xiaoqian' appeared, so we haven't identified the identity of that missing corpse yet,\" Old Xu recalled.\n\nLu Qianxing nodded, then fell into thought. A moment later, he spoke again, asking Old Xu, \"Was there anything special about the missing corpse?\"\n\n\"No, the deceased was burned all over, with basically no intact skin. Especially the face, it was so badly burned that it was unrecognizable,\" Old Xu said, feeling a wave of nausea as he remembered the previous corpse.\n\n\"You should have photos. Let me see the photos from the accident scene.\"\n\n\"I have a few photos here; they should be quite detailed,\" Zheng Tian said, quickly pulling out his phone and handing it to Lu Qianxing. Due to Zheng Tian's involvement, Old Xu and his group had briefly explained the 'Route 18' bus incident to him.\n\nLu Qianxing took Zheng Tian's phone and began to scroll through the photos. Zheng Tian had downloaded all the accident scene photos he had taken with his camera onto his phone.\n\n\"When did the accident happen?\" After viewing all the photos, Lu Qianxing asked Zheng Tian beside him.\n\n\"Around 2:30 AM, a plastic lighter in a car exploded and caught fire, igniting the vehicle. The driver, in a panic, jumped out of the car. The car then hit the victim by the roadside, causing the accident,\" Zheng Tian recounted the detailed circumstances of the accident to Lu Qianxing.\n\nAfter listening to Zheng Tian's account, Lu Qianxing nodded thoughtfully, then turned his gaze to Old Xu. \"Uncle Xu, did you find anything strange at the accident scene?\"\n\n\"Anything strange? No.\" Old Xu and his team had conducted a thorough inspection of the accident scene and found nothing unusual. \"However, afterward, I had someone perform an autopsy on the corpse. The autopsy found that the deceased had DNA from two people. One was Ding Xiaoqian, and the other was untraceable. At the time, we suspected organ transplantation, so we wanted to re-examine the body. But just then, the body mysteriously disappeared, and then this current case occurred,\" Old Xu explained meticulously, providing all the details to Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"If it was organ transplantation, that possibility can likely be ruled out, especially since Binzi later met with Ding Xiaoqian,\" Chen Hui added.\n\n\"Although the deceased wasn't Ding Xiaoqian, the problem now is why Ding Xiaoqian's DNA was on the deceased. Based on this, we speculated that the deceased and Ding Xiaoqian must have had some kind of relationship. However, when we asked Binzi about these matters, he only replied that Ding Xiaoqian was not the murderer.\" After Ye Bin met with Ding Xiaoqian, everyone questioned him about her, but Ye Bin's answer was always the same.\n\n\"'Ding Xiaoqian is not the murderer.'\"\n\n\"I never expected Binzi to be so biased towards Ding Xiaoqian,\" Chen Hui commented, feeling a bit emotional. In all the time he had known Ye Bin, this was the first time he had seen Ye Bin so biased towards someone.\n\n\"Perhaps it's not bias. Binzi trusts Ding Xiaoqian so much; I think there must be a reason,\" Old Xu said, recalling Ye Bin's immense trust in Ding Xiaoqian. He felt that Ye Bin's feelings for Ding Xiaoqian were not simply favoritism.\n\n\"Regarding Ding Xiaoqian, with Binzi involved, we can only trust him.\" Chen Hui finally sighed deeply. Although he was highly suspicious of Ding Xiaoqian, he could only choose to believe Ye Bin.\n\n\"The presence of Ding Xiaoqian's DNA on the deceased can only be further deduced after identifying the deceased's true identity. However, with the body missing, it's likely impossible to find out their identity,\" Old Xu said, shaking his head, feeling a headache coming on. So many times they had been close to the truth, only for something to go wrong.\n\n\"I have a way to find the body,\" Lu Qianxing suddenly said, causing everyone to be stunned. In an instant, all their gazes converged on Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"You have a way to find the body!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Lu Qianxing nodded, then looked at the corpse in the body bag. \"Besides finding the missing body, we now have an even more important issue.\"\n\n\"A more important issue?\" Confusion flashed across everyone's faces. They couldn't understand what Lu Qianxing meant by \"a more important issue.\"\n\n\"Uncle Xu, I recall you saying earlier that this body had been deceased for at least a week, but in reality, the time of death was less than two days, correct?\" Lu Qianxing asked Old Xu, reminding him.\n\n\"That's right! We haven't figured out what's going on with that yet. It's not just the deceased this time, but also the four students from Yunxiang High School.\"\n\n\"If my judgment is correct, the reason for this situation is that the deceased's soul was extracted long ago,\" Lu Qianxing said, frowning slightly.\n\n\"Soul extracted? What does that mean?\" Old Xu and the others looked surprised, unable to understand Lu Qianxing's words.\n\n\"You can probably guess what a soul represents. If a person's soul is lost, they become a walking corpse. And this is why your autopsy indicated the deceased had been dead for nearly a week, because the person's soul was extracted long ago,\" Lu Qianxing explained slowly.\n\n\"Wait! I have a question. If the deceased was just a walking corpse, wouldn't they have no consciousness? But earlier, his colleague said he was no different from usual. Doesn't that not add up?\" Zheng Tian raised his doubt.\n\nLu Qianxing didn't answer Zheng Tian's question. Instead, he took a talisman from his pocket and placed it on the deceased's forehead. After placing the talisman, Lu Qianxing began to chant an incantation. A moment later, the deceased's body suddenly began to tremble slightly.\n\nWitnessing such a bizarre scene, everyone felt cold sweat breaking out on their foreheads.\n\n\"Qianxing, what are you doing! Isn't this going to bring the corpse back to life!\" Chen Hui stammered, moving to stand between Old Xu and Zhao Zhen.\n\n\"What... what's going on!\" The sudden trembling of the body left Zheng Tian with his mouth half open, his face filled with shock.\n\n\"There's something on the arm!\" Old Xu had been closely watching the body. When Lu Qianxing placed the talisman and chanted, Old Xu was the first to notice a special mark suddenly appearing on the deceased's arm, one that hadn't been there before.\n\n\"Soul mark!\" Looking at the special mark on the corpse's arm, Lu Qianxing's face showed a hint of surprise.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 166: Direction\n\n“Zombie Imprint!”\n\nSeeing the mark that suddenly appeared on the deceased’s arm, a terrifying thought struck everyone.\n\n“Zombie Imprint? Could it be that someone is controlling the corpse?” Based on the literal meaning, Ning Hua was the first to speak, making a guess.\n\n“A scene from a movie, appearing in reality,” Old Xu frowned, recalling a movie he had watched before, which also featured a method to control the bodies of the deceased.\n\n“It sounds a bit creepy!” Chen Hui gave a wry smile, feeling the hair on his body stand on end in an instant.\n\n“The deceased’s soul was already extracted, and for these past few days, the reason why the deceased appeared not like a zombie but still as usual is because of this ‘Zombie Imprint’ on their arm.” Lu Qianxing answered their speculations.\n\n“So, does this mean someone is secretly controlling the corpse?” Zhao Zhen asked calmly, his gaze fixed on the mark on the deceased’s arm, lost in thought.\n\n“The Zombie Imprint is indeed a technique to control corpses, but it’s different from the method of control you understand. The Zombie Imprint doesn’t mean someone is secretly controlling the corpse; rather, the technique itself controls the corpse.”\n\n“What does ‘the technique itself’ mean?” Everyone looked at Lu Qianxing with confusion, unable to understand his explanation.\n\n“Simply put, the function of the Zombie Imprint is merely to allow this corpse, which has already lost its soul, to move as it did before, not in a zombie-like state.” Lu Qianxing explained further.\n\n“If I understand correctly, you mean this technique just makes the corpse, which has already become a zombie, behave like the deceased did when they were alive, but in reality, the corpse is just an empty shell without consciousness.” Old Xu immediately understood Lu Qianxing’s meaning based on what he said.\n\n“Mm.”\n\n“I have a question. According to what you said, the deceased’s soul was extracted long ago. So, what was the killer’s motive? There are so many people in the police station, why extract only his soul?” Zheng Tian felt something was not right.\n\n“Indeed, I’ve also considered this question. If that’s the case, why would the killer only extract this one person’s soul?” Ning Hua agreed with Zheng Tian’s thought, as he had the same idea.\n\nLu Qianxing did not answer Zheng Tian and Ning Hua’s questions, instead asking them back, “Have you thoroughly investigated the deceased’s identity?”\n\n“We haven’t, really. At first, everyone just thought the deceased was a victim because of the missing corpse, and there wasn’t much connection to the deceased themselves.” Old Xu admitted frankly, acknowledging the oversight in their investigation.\n\n“Whether it’s the four students from Yunxiang High School or the deceased now, the killer must have had a reason to target them,” Lu Qianxing said calmly, with absolute confidence in his judgment.\n\n“Mm, I will go and investigate the deceased’s identity in detail later. But, Qianxing, is it true that you can find that missing corpse, as you said earlier?” Setting aside the matter of the police station deceased for now, Old Xu thought of the missing corpse.\n\n“There shouldn’t be any problem,” Lu Qianxing said, and then took out a compass from his pocket. He held the compass in his left hand, brought his right index finger to his mouth, bit it lightly, and let a drop of blood seep out. Lu Qianxing dripped the blood from his right index finger onto the compass in his left hand.\n\nUnder everyone’s astonished gaze, the compass needle began to spin rapidly. After spinning about three and a half circles, the needle reversed and spun two circles before finally stopping, pointing towards the northwest.\n\n“It stopped!” Zheng Tian exclaimed excitedly.\n\n“The corpse is in the northwest direction? Then, we can find the corpse by following the needle on the compass, right?” When everyone was trapped in the abandoned residential area before, they escaped by following the compass’s guidance. With the experience from last time, Zhao Zhen had great faith in the compass in Lu Qianxing’s hand.\n\n“Let’s not delay any longer, let’s go.” Lu Qianxing said no more, and urged everyone to depart according to the compass’s direction.\n\n“Wait a moment!” Just as everyone was about to follow Lu Qianxing, Old Xu, with a grim expression, suddenly called out to the departing group.\n\n“Old Xu, what’s wrong?” Zhao Zhen asked, confused, as Old Xu had stopped them.\n\n“The direction the compass is pointing, do you not notice anything?” Old Xu said in a deep voice, his gaze fixed on the direction indicated by the compass.\n\n“Northwest direction, what else is there to notice?” Zhao Zhen scratched his head, very confused by Old Xu’s words.\n\nEveryone looked in the direction the compass was pointing. At first, everyone was bewildered, but after a moment, Chen Hui, Ning Hua, and Lu Qianxing’s expressions turned serious instantly.\n\n“That direction is…” Chen Hui murmured, involuntarily shivering.\n\n“You kid, what is it! Don’t be coy! What’s wrong? Why did the three of you suddenly look so serious? Is there a ghost over there!” Zhao Zhen said impatiently. He still couldn’t see what was wrong with the direction the compass was pointing.\n\n“There really is a ghost over there,” Ning Hua said, his face grim, his brows furrowed, his lips pressed together.\n\n“What! Where’s the ghost!” Hearing Ning Hua’s words, Zhao Zhen also shivered involuntarily.\n\nZheng Tian was utterly confused by their exchange. He looked from Old Xu, to Chen Hui, then to Zhao Zhen and Ning Hua, and finally his gaze fell on Lu Qianxing, but throughout, Zheng Tian could not understand what was happening at all.\n\n“Old Zhao, haven’t you noticed yet?” Old Xu said coldly, turning his gaze to Zhao Zhen.\n\n“Noticed what! I say, Old Xu, since when did you like to be coy? What did you guys discover, hurry up and tell me! It’s really making me anxious!”\n\n“Blackwater Village.” Old Xu said calmly. The next instant, Zhao Zhen froze on the spot, then looked again at the location indicated by the compass.\n\n“That… that’s the direction of Blackwater Village. Could it be? The corpse is in Blackwater Village?” Hearing Blackwater Village, Zhao Zhen immediately thought of everything that had happened there before. The next instant, Zhao Zhen felt his body was not under his control and began to tremble uncontrollably. “N-no way,” Zhao Zhen said with a wry smile, looking at Old Xu beside him.\n\n“Are we… going to Blackwater Village again?” Chen Hui sighed, though he had overcome his fear in Blackwater Village back then, he still felt lingering dread in his heart.\n\n“Honestly, if I had a choice, I really wouldn’t want to go to that place again,” Ning Hua managed an awkward smile to hide his fear.\n\n“If we want to find the killer, we have no choice,” Old Xu shook his head, sighing helplessly.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 167: Re-exploring Blackwater Village\n\nTo search for the body that mysteriously disappeared from the police station, Old Xu and his team headed to Blackwater Village once again for an investigation.\n\nOn the way to Blackwater Village, after Old Xu informed Ye Bin of the police station's findings, Ye Bin, Zhang Lan, and Lin Xiao immediately set off, arriving at Blackwater Village around the same time as Old Xu and his group.\n\n\"Who exactly was that body? Why did it suddenly disappear and then appear in Blackwater Village?\" Zhang Lan's mind was filled with questions after Ye Bin recounted what Old Xu had told him.\n\n\"The identity of the body hasn't been determined yet. As for why it appeared in Blackwater Village, I believe it was the work of the culprit from the 'Route 18' bus case,\" Ye Bin opined, thinking the police station's case was directly related to the \"Route 18\" bus incident.\n\n\"Binzi, didn't you ask Ding Xiaoqian about the body? What did she say?\"\n\nIn response to Zhang Lan's inquiry, Ye Bin shook his head helplessly. \"I didn't ask her about the body. I only know that the culprit in the 'Route 18' bus case is likely that little girl's father. Since the missing body from the police station is related to Ding Xiaoqian, I'm guessing the body's disappearance was the work of the 'Route 18' bus killer.\"\n\n\"There's some logic to what you're saying,\" Zhang Lan nodded slightly and didn't press further.\n\nAlthough the group was rushing towards Blackwater Village at full speed, due to the time, the sky was gradually darkening.\n\n\"Binzi, you've arrived too.\" As Old Xu's group reached Blackwater Village, they noticed Lin Xiao's car parked by the roadside.\n\n\"Yes, Uncle Xu. Um, Uncle Xu, why aren't Chen Hui and the others here? And who is this?\" Ye Bin was a bit puzzled when he saw only Old Xu, Zhao Zhen, and a stranger get out of the car.\n\n\"Oh, Chen Hui and the others are driving a bit slowly and missed a couple of traffic lights. They should be here soon.\" Old Xu said this as he introduced Zheng Tian to Ye Bin and the other two. \"Come, let me introduce you. This is Officer Zheng Tian. We owe a lot of his help for this case.\"\n\n\"Captain Ye, long time no see.\" Zheng Tian displayed a grateful smile upon seeing Ye Bin.\n\n\"Zheng Tian! I knew you looked familiar. It really has been a long time, at least almost a year, right?\" At first, Ye Bin hadn't recognized Zheng Tian, only finding him somewhat familiar. But after Old Xu's introduction, Ye Bin immediately recognized him.\n\n\"Thank you, Captain Ye, for what happened back then.\"\n\n\"No need for formalities. Since you're here, I assume Uncle Xu has told you everything.\" Ye Bin guessed that Zheng Tian's presence meant Old Xu had already briefed him on the \"Route 18\" bus case.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zheng Tian nodded, then his gaze fell upon Lin Xiao next to Ye Bin. \"Captain Ye, this is... Lin Xiao, Detective Lin, right!\" Lin Xiao was quite famous among the younger police officers, so Zheng Tian recognized him as the renowned Lin Xiao upon first sight.\n\n\"Oh, yes, this is Detective Lin.\" Ye Bin was taken aback for a moment, then realized what was happening and quickly introduced Lin Xiao to Zheng Tian.\n\n\"Detective Lin, hello. My name is Zheng Tian,\" Zheng Tian said, extending his hand to Lin Xiao with visible excitement.\n\n\"Hello.\" Lin Xiao replied calmly and then shook Zheng Tian's hand.\n\n\"I've heard so much about you, Detective Lin. I never expected to have the honor of meeting you today.\" Zheng Tian was extremely excited at this moment. The thought of investigating a case with Lin Xiao made him feel like he had reached the pinnacle of his life.\n\nLin Xiao merely smiled at Zheng Tian's enthusiasm and didn't say much.\n\nAfter shaking hands with Lin Xiao, Zheng Tian was introduced to Zhang Lan by Ye Bin.\n\nJust as Zheng Tian and Zhang Lan finished introducing themselves, Chen Hui and his group finally arrived at Blackwater Village.\n\n\"Binzi! I thought we would have arrived before you, but I didn't expect you to be here already!\" Chen Hui got out of the car and was the first to greet Ye Bin.\n\n\"You were driving, weren't you? Still as slow as ever.\" Ye Bin and Chen Hui obtained their driver's licenses together, and Ye Bin had now become an experienced driver, but Chen Hui was still like a novice, driving erratically.\n\n\"Slow? Then don't ride with me next time!\" Hearing Ye Bin's words, Chen Hui's face immediately darkened, and he glared fiercely at Ye Bin.\n\n\"Haha!\" Seeing the interaction between Ye Bin and Chen Hui, everyone else burst into laughter.\n\nAfter the laughter died down, Lu Qianxing took out a stack of talismans from his pocket. While chanting an incantation, he handed the talismans to everyone.\n\nAfter distributing all the talismans, Lu Qianxing gravely cautioned everyone.\n\n\"Everyone, please hold onto your talismans carefully. What happens when we enter Blackwater Village later, anything could happen. If you encounter anything you shouldn't, remember to immediately take out your talisman and place it on your forehead. No matter what you hear, absolutely do not look back! Remember!\"\n\n\"Binzi, can I request to withdraw from the team?\" After hearing Lu Qianxing's warning, Chen Hui shivered and quietly asked Ye Bin beside him.\n\n\"I heard lonely ghosts like to find people who are alone,\" Zhang Lan said jokingly next to Ye Bin after hearing Chen Hui's words.\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Perhaps you should just drive back. We'll be fine here.\" Ye Bin knew Chen Hui was timid and was worried something might happen to him.\n\nHearing Ye Bin's words, Chen Hui gave an awkward laugh. \"I was just saying. How could I leave at a time like this!\"\n\n\"I say, you kid, you're not too scared to even drive, are you! Haha!\" Zhao Zhen, like Zhang Lan, teased him.\n\n\"...\"\n\nIn the end, no one withdrew, and they all entered Blackwater Village together.\n\nThey hadn't walked far into Blackwater Village before the sky completely darkened. The group had to take out their pre-prepared flashlights and carefully advance, holding their lights.\n\n\"It's really eerie here. I feel like something is following me,\" Zheng Tian, investigating Blackwater Village for the first time, took a deep breath and spoke with a trembling voice as he saw the burnt remnants of Blackwater Village.\n\n\"Don't look around. Keep moving forward!\" Lu Qianxing quickly reminded Zheng Tian, noticing him constantly scanning his surroundings.\n\n\"Xiao Tian, if you're scared, walk between me and Old Zhao.\" Seeing how frightened Zheng Tian looked, Old Xu beckoned him to walk between himself and Zhao Zhen.\n\n\"Okay, Uncle Xu.\" Zheng Tian nodded and moved to stand between Old Xu and Zhao Zhen.\n\n\"Binzi, Lan Ge, stay close. And Qian Xing, walk a bit slower, don't get too far from me. Oh, right, Detective Lin, keep up too, don't get lost!\" Chen Hui, walking in front of Lin Xiao and Lu Qianxing, and sandwiched between Ye Bin and Zhang Lan, twisted his head and spoke to everyone.\n\n\"I've seen timid people, but I've never seen anyone as timid as you!\" Ning Hua, walking between the two groups, shook his head helplessly upon seeing Chen Hui, who was tightly surrounded by four people.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 168: Figure in the Darkness\n\nAs night fell, the moment the sunlight vanished, a chilling, eerie wind suddenly arrived.\n\n\"Weird, this weather, why did it suddenly get windy? Is it trying to be dramatic or something.\" Walking between Old Xu and Zhao Zhen, Zheng Tian shivered from the sudden cold wind.\n\n\"Be careful, something's not quite right.\" Lu Qianxing scanned their surroundings, a bad feeling in his heart. \"Everyone try to stay close together, absolutely do not split up.\"\n\n\"Qianxing!\" Just as Lu Qianxing finished speaking, Ye Bin frowned and said in a deep voice.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Lu Qianxing turned and looked at Ye Bin with confusion.\n\n\"Uncle Xu and the others are gone!\" Ye Bin said, shining his flashlight towards a spot beside them. The previous second, Old Xu, Zhao Zhen, and Zheng Tian had been standing there, but now, the three of them had vanished as if they had evaporated into thin air, disappearing very abruptly.\n\nLu Qianxing was stunned for a moment upon hearing this. Then, his gaze shifted to the spot where Old Xu and the other two had been. Seeing nothing but the wreckage of abandoned houses in front of him, Lu Qianxing's gaze sharpened, and his expression instantly turned extremely grim.\n\n\"Qianxing! Won't they be okay?\" Zhang Lan murmured softly, looking at Lu Qianxing beside her.\n\n\"As long as they have the talismans on them, they'll be fine.\" Lu Qianxing's words were firm, filled with absolute confidence in the talismans he had given everyone earlier.\n\n\"Can just one talisman really be enough?\" Chen Hui looked at the talisman in his hand, harboring doubts.\n\n\"The talismans you have were left by my father. With his cultivation, they'll be fine.\" In reality, the talismans Lu Qianxing gave everyone were not drawn by himself, but were left behind by Lu Qianxing's father. Lu Qianxing had absolute trust in his father, as his father's cultivation was far superior to his own.\n\nAfter hearing Lu Qianxing's explanation, Chen Hui nodded, not saying anything further.\n\n\"Even with the protection of the talismans, where did they go? Why did they disappear all of a sudden?\" Zhang Lan spoke again. Although she trusted the talismans Lu Qianxing gave them, she couldn't shake off her worry when faced with the sudden disappearance of the three.\n\n\"Have you guys noticed if our surroundings have changed at all?\" While everyone was still focused on the missing Old Xu and the other two, Lin Xiao, who had been silent until then, suddenly spoke.\n\n\"Changed?\" Hearing Lin Xiao's words, everyone's gazes involuntarily swept across their surroundings. The next moment, after everyone had finished looking around, their gazes all sharpened, and a hint of shock flashed across their faces.\n\nHaving investigated Blackwater Village many times, everyone had a certain memory of the place. Based on the images in their memories, they could instantly determine that their current location was different from Blackwater Village. In particular, there should have been a graveyard not far from Blackwater Village, but now, no matter how hard they searched, they couldn't find the graveyard.\n\n\"It seems... it's not Old Xu and the others who disappeared, but rather we disappeared.\" Realizing the change in their surroundings, Ye Bin understood that it was highly possible that they themselves had disappeared from Blackwater Village, rather than Old Xu and the others.\n\n\"If this isn't Blackwater Village, then where is this?\" Zhang Lan looked around. Apart from the absence of the expected graveyard in Blackwater Village, everything else was basically the same as Blackwater Village.\n\nLu Qianxing took out the compass he carried in his pocket. The needle on the compass was spinning rapidly towards one spot, as if the instrument had suddenly malfunctioned.\n\n\"The compass is malfunctioning. It seems our guess is correct. We shouldn't be in Blackwater Village, or perhaps, not the Blackwater Village we came to before.\" Although the graveyard was missing and there were minor changes to the surrounding environment, based on the wreckage of abandoned houses around them and the path they had walked, Lu Qianxing felt they hadn't actually left Blackwater Village.\n\n\"Could we have fallen into an illusion again?\" Chen Hui spoke in a low voice, clutching Ye Bin's arm tightly.\n\n\"No, to prevent falling into an illusion, I specifically brought this.\" Lu Qianxing said, taking out a bell from his pocket. \"This is a 'Phantom-Breaking Bell.' If we were caught in an illusion, the bell would ring. Since the bell hasn't rung, it at least proves that we haven't fallen into an illusion.\" Lu Qianxing's preparations were thorough. After what happened in Blackwater Village last time, Lu Qianxing had always carried the 'Phantom-Breaking Bell.'\n\n\"My phone has no signal either. It seems we've lost all means of contacting Old Xu and the others.\" Although he had already anticipated the outcome, Ye Bin still took out his phone, wanting to try his luck. But the result was the same as he had expected; for some reason, his phone had entered a no-signal state.\n\n\"It seems something doesn't want us here.\" Zhang Lan said coldly, scanning her surroundings, trying to find something, but without any success.\n\nAt the same time, Old Xu and the other three also noticed the sudden disappearance of Ye Bin and the others at the same moment.\n\n\"Ninghua, Binzi and the others were right beside you. Didn't you notice when they disappeared?\" Zhao Zhen asked in disbelief, questioning Ninghua, who was closest to Ye Bin and the others.\n\nNinghua shook his head helplessly. \"I don't know! Because Qianxing told us not to look around, I kept looking straight ahead. I don't know why they suddenly vanished!\" He sounded a bit anxious towards the end.\n\nOld Xu frowned, his gaze sweeping around. He couldn't find anything unusual. \"Everyone, don't panic for now. Binzi and the others have Qianxing with them, they'll be fine. As for us, be careful and don't lose the talismans Qianxing gave you.\" Among the four, Old Xu remained the most composed.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, I just saw a figure dart past behind that house!\" Just as Old Xu finished speaking, Zheng Tian pointed at the wreckage of an abandoned house not far away, his voice trembling with fear.\n\nHearing Zheng Tian's words, Old Xu and the other two shivered. Then, they looked in the direction Zheng Tian pointed, but apart from the wreckage of the abandoned house, the three of them saw no mysterious figure that Zheng Tian had spoken of.\n\n\"Xiao Tian! You're not joking at a time like this, are you!\" Zhao Zhen, shivering, looked at Zheng Tian with suspicion.\n\n\"Uncle Zhao, if you gave me ten times the courage, I wouldn't dare to joke! I really saw a figure dart past just now!\" Zheng Tian forced a bitter smile, his entire being already plunged into a state of extreme fear.\n\n\"Did you get a clear look at what the figure looked like?\" Old Xu tried his best to calm himself, then asked Zheng Tian.\n\n\"I couldn't see clearly, but based on the figure's size, it seemed to be a child.\"\n\n\"A child!\" After Zheng Tian said this, a similar thought flashed through Old Xu's and the other two's minds simultaneously. Then, all three of them froze on the spot, a look of dread spreading across their faces.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 169: Blackwater Village?\n\n\"Xiao Tian! Are you sure you didn't misread? Was it really the figure of a child?\" Old Xu asked, his brow furrowed and his expression grave.\n\nSeeing Old Xu's reaction, Zheng Tian was a little stunned. He didn't understand why Old Xu suddenly became so flustered. After all, even when Ye Bin and the others had disappeared earlier, Old Xu had remained quite calm.\n\n\"Although that figure only flashed by, judging by its outline, it didn't look like an adult, more like a child. But in these desolate mountains, there shouldn't be children, so maybe I saw wrong. Perhaps it was just a wild dog or something.\" Zheng Tian himself began to doubt what he had seen.\n\n\"Old Xu, do you think it could be...\" Zhao Zhen's brows were furrowed, and like Old Xu, his expression was one of apparent panic.\n\n\"From now on, stop advancing. We'll wait here for Ye Bin and the others to appear.\" To avoid further danger by going deeper, Old Xu decided that the group would wait in their current location for rescue from Ye Bin and the others.\n\n\"Should we stick the talismans Qian Xing gave us on our foreheads?\" Zhao Zhen recalled Lu Qian Xing's earlier warning: if they encountered danger, they should stick the talisman on their foreheads immediately.\n\n\"Yes, everyone sit together, and after sticking the talismans on your foreheads, no matter what happens, remember not to look back.\"\n\nAfter the four of them, Old Xu included, stuck the talismans Lu Qian Xing had given them onto their foreheads, they sat in a circle on the ground, quietly waiting for rescue from Ye Bin's group.\n\nMeanwhile, Ye Bin's side, with Lu Qian Xing, was investigating the surroundings under his guidance, trying to find any anomalies. However, after their investigation, none of them found anything unusual. Apart from the graveyard next to Blackwater Village and the tomb without a tombstone disappearing, everything else in Blackwater Village was basically the same as before.\n\n\"The biggest discovery now is that the graveyard and the nameless tombstone next to Blackwater Village have disappeared. Other than that, there are those abandoned houses over there. I remember when we first arrived, there wasn't that tree around that house! But now, a tree has appeared for no reason.\" Ye Bin said, gesturing for Lu Qian Xing beside him to look at a willow tree standing next to the abandoned house not far away.\n\n\"Are there any other anomalies besides these?\" Compared to Ye Bin, Lu Qian Xing didn't remember the surroundings of Blackwater Village as clearly, only recalling the graveyard and the nameless tombstone.\n\n\"Other than that, the ruins are somewhat different from what I remember, but I can't quite pinpoint the specific differences.\" Ye Bin scanned the surroundings again and again. Besides the conspicuous willow tree, Ye Bin couldn't tell where else there were any differences.\n\n\"Qian Xing, are we still in Blackwater Village? Could we have gone to another place?\" Zhang Lan speculated, picturing scenes he'd seen in movies where people were unknowingly transported to a mysterious place by unknown forces.\n\n\"No, you all have the talismans my father left behind. No matter how powerful a ghost is, it couldn't move us to another place without us knowing.\" Lu Qian Xing had complete confidence in his father's talismans.\n\n\"But the place we are in now is indeed different from Blackwater Village!\" Chen Hui raised his doubts. Lu Qian Xing had said earlier that they weren't trapped in an illusion, but the disappearance of the graveyard and the nameless tombstone next to Blackwater Village made Chen Hui suspicious. Was Lu Qian Xing's judgment mistaken?\n\nHearing Chen Hui's question, Lu Qian Xing scratched his head. Although he believed his father's talismans were flawless, he didn't know how to explain the disappearance of the graveyard and the nameless tombstone next to Blackwater Village.\n\n\"Was the place we arrived at before really Blackwater Village?\" Just as everyone was pondering why the graveyard and the nameless tombstone had disappeared, Lin Xiao suddenly spoke, causing everyone to freeze. Then, their gazes turned to Lin Xiao.\n\n\"Detective Lin means we weren't in Blackwater Village to begin with?\" After hearing Lin Xiao's words, Chen Hui's confusion deepened once more. For a moment, he truly began to doubt if their group had indeed arrived at Blackwater Village.\n\n\"The route shouldn't be wrong. We arrived at Blackwater Village in three groups. If the route was wrong, surely not everyone would have made the same mistake.\" Zhang Lan did not agree with Lin Xiao's statement and explained his reasoning.\n\nYe Bin crossed one arm and rested his chin on his hand, thinking seriously about what Lin Xiao had said. After a long pause, Ye Bin seemed to have thought of something and turned his gaze to Lu Qian Xing.\n\n\"Qian Xing, have you always carried your Illusion-Breaking Bell with you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Lu Qian Xing nodded. \"I've always carried the Illusion-Breaking Bell with me, and it hasn't rung so far, so you can rest assured, we haven't been trapped in an illusion.\" Lu Qian Xing somewhat understood Ye Bin's meaning and quickly explained.\n\n\"Brother Lan just said that we arrived at Blackwater Village in three groups, so the route shouldn't be wrong. However, if the first group that arrived at Blackwater Village went the wrong way, then when Uncle Xu and Chen Hui arrived by car, they would have seen our car and wouldn't have suspected we took the wrong path.\" Ye Bin said slowly. After he finished speaking, everyone's gaze, except for Lin Xiao's, narrowed slightly.\n\n\"Qian Xing has the Illusion-Breaking Bell, so they wouldn't be trapped in an illusion or go the wrong way. However, we who arrived earlier didn't have the Illusion-Breaking Bell. If we were trapped in an illusion and went the wrong way, then when Uncle Xu and Chen Hui saw us, they would have mistakenly assumed they had already arrived at Blackwater Village. In this way, we would have all naturally gone the wrong way.\" Ye Bin continued his reasoning.\n\n\"There's only this one road to Blackwater Village, and the scenery along the way is basically the same. Even if we missed a section of the road, it wouldn't be easily noticed. And when we saw where you stopped, we naturally assumed we had arrived, so by following you, we naturally went the wrong way.\" After hearing Ye Bin's deduction, Chen Hui finally understood everything.\n\nZhang Lan's face darkened as he looked around, two questions forming in his mind. \"If we were trapped in an illusion, then how did we get trapped? And if this isn't Blackwater Village, then where is this place?\"\n\n\"Although this isn't Blackwater Village, we probably aren't too far from it.\"\n\n\"We've investigated the surroundings of Blackwater Village at least dozens of times, but have you ever seen a place like this exist?\" Zhang Lan asked the others, his brow furrowed. \"Since we weren't trapped in an illusion, then everything around us is real. But when did all of this appear!\"\n\nZhang Lan's questions were also the questions on everyone's minds, but at this moment, none of them could figure out what was happening.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 170: The Pitch-Black Forest\n\n\"Qian Xing, how is it? Found anything?\" Concerned for the safety of Old Xu and his group, Ye Bin and the others dropped everything they were doing and began searching for them. However, after searching the surroundings, they still couldn't find any clues.\n\n\"No,\" Lu Qian Xing shook his head helplessly. He had tried every method he could think of, but it was all in vain.\n\n\"Four grown men, just vanishing like that. It's like seeing a ghost,\" Zhang Lan said with a wry smile, but he was worried about the safety of Old Xu and his group.\n\n\"Qian Xing, Uncle Xu and the others have your father's talismans. They should be alright, right?\" Ye Bin asked Lu Qian Xing with a worried expression, fearing that something might happen to Old Xu and his group.\n\nIn response, Lu Qian Xing first nodded, then shook his head again with a sigh.\n\n\"What do you mean by nodding and shaking your head? Are they going to be alright or not?\" Seeing Lu Qian Xing nod and shake his head again, Zhang Lan became a little anxious.\n\n\"I can't say for sure. Although I have confidence in my father's talismans, if they really encounter something particularly terrifying, then...\" Lu Qian Xing avoided everyone's gaze and lowered his head. \"The power of talismans is ultimately limited. If we can't find them soon, I can't say what might happen.\" After speaking, Lu Qian Xing apologized to everyone with self-blame. \"I'm sorry. It's all my fault for being so useless and not noticing the abnormality sooner. Otherwise, it wouldn't have come to this.\"\n\nSeeing Lu Qian Xing's self-reproachful expression, Zhang Lan realized that his emotions had been a bit too extreme. He then stepped forward and gently patted Lu Qian Xing's shoulder. \"If anyone should apologize, it should be us. After all, if it weren't for us, everyone wouldn't have taken the wrong path, and thus, what's happening now wouldn't have occurred. However, we have no other options now. We can only rely on you.\"\n\n\"Yes, Qian Xing, it's not your fault. If it weren't for you, we don't know what kind of danger we would have fallen into,\" Ye Bin also chimed in, trying to comfort the self-blaming Lu Qian Xing.\n\n\"Qian Xing, there's no time for self-blame. You have to hurry and lead us out of this godforsaken place,\" Chen Hui said with a wry smile, his face filled with fear.\n\nHearing everyone's persuasion, Lu Qian Xing's self-blame subsided considerably. He then nodded and continued to brainstorm, looking for clues about Old Xu and his group.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Lin Xiao, who had been standing to the side, remained silent. Instead, his gaze swept around the surroundings, as if searching for something.\n\n\"Detective Lin, have you found anything?\" Ye Bin walked up to Lin Xiao and asked softly. Before this, it was Lin Xiao who first noticed the abnormality. Now, seeing Lin Xiao's gaze constantly scanning the surroundings, Ye Bin felt that Lin Xiao must have discovered something again.\n\n\"While you were talking, I vaguely saw a figure dart past,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, but everyone was stunned.\n\n\"A figure? Where?\"\n\n\"Over there.\" Lin Xiao pointed to the place where he saw the figure dart past. It was a dilapidated house with only half a wall remaining.\n\nFollowing the direction Lin Xiao pointed, Ye Bin and the other two, except for Chen Hui, went to investigate. However, after investigating, they still found nothing unusual.\n\n\"Qian Xing, did you find anything?\"\n\n\"No,\" Lu Qian Xing shrugged and replied helplessly.\n\n\"Judging by the size of that figure, it should be a child,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, as if he wasn't surprised by his discovery.\n\n\"A child? Could it be that little girl?\" Ye Bin murmured, a little girl's figure appearing in his mind.\n\n\"A resurrection of the dead!\" Chen Hui shivered all over, suddenly feeling a chill down his spine. However, Chen Hui didn't dare to look back. Instead, he quickly ran to Ye Bin's side, grabbing Ye Bin's arm tightly with both hands.\n\n\"If it really was that little girl, I shouldn't have noticed nothing,\" Lu Qian Xing scratched his head, extremely puzzled. The previous times, in places where the little girl had appeared, he could feel a terrifying malevolent energy. But this time, Lu Qian Xing hadn't sensed anything.\n\n\"Could it be that it wasn't that little girl?\" Zhang Lan murmured to himself, guessing.\n\n\"Detective Lin, in what direction did that figure disappear?\" Ye Bin pondered for a long time, then suddenly asked Lin Xiao.\n\n\"That way!\" Lin Xiao pointed to the direction where the figure disappeared. It was a forest at the end of the dilapidated house.\n\n\"Should we go and investigate?\" Looking at the forest Lin Xiao pointed to, Zhang Lan felt a chill. He couldn't help but wonder if something terrifying might suddenly appear in that pitch-black forest.\n\n\"What does Detective Lin think?\" Ye Bin didn't answer Zhang Lan's question but turned to look at Lin Xiao. He felt that there must be a reason why Lin Xiao hadn't suggested investigating yet.\n\n\"Don't you think that forest looks familiar?\"\n\n\"Familiar?\" Hearing Lin Xiao's words, everyone was stunned for a moment, then turned their gaze towards the pitch-black forest and examined it carefully.\n\n\"It just looks like an ordinary forest,\" Zhang Lan murmured, not noticing anything different.\n\n\"I can sense a dangerous aura in that forest,\" Lu Qian Xing said, taking out his compass again. At this moment, the needle of the compass was no longer spinning but was pointing in the direction of the forest.\n\n\"There must be something in this forest!\" Seeing the compass needle, Lu Qian Xing was convinced that there must be something terrifying in that pitch-black forest.\n\nYe Bin ignored what everyone said and kept his gaze fixed on the forest. After a long while, Ye Bin's eyelids twitched, as if he had discovered something. \"This forest, I remember it!\"\n\n\"Remember what?\" Apart from Lin Xiao, Zhang Lan and the other two looked at Ye Bin with confusion.\n\n\"Brother Lan, do you still remember the 'Bus Route 18' bus stop surrounded by a forest not far from Blackwater Village?\" Ye Bin reminded them.\n\n\"It just looks like a forest. This doesn't prove that it's the same forest as before,\" Zhang Lan felt that Ye Bin's guess was a bit far-fetched.\n\n\"Whether it is or not, let's go and check,\" Ye Bin had already decided to go into that forest to verify.\n\n\"No! This forest is too dangerous. If we go in rashly, no one can say what dangers we might encounter,\" Lu Qian Xing said, directly rejecting Ye Bin's idea.\n\n\"Yes, Bin Zi, it's too dangerous to go rashly at this time. Besides, we still haven't found Old Xu and the others. The most important thing now is to find them. Even if we have to go and investigate, it should be after we find them,\" Zhang Lan also disagreed with going into that dark and eerie terrifying forest at this moment.\n\n\"What if Uncle Xu and the others might be in that forest?\" Ye Bin said, looking at Old Xu and Lu Qian Xing.\n\n\"This...\" Zhang Lan frowned, not knowing how to answer for a moment.\n\n\"It's not impossible,\" After hearing Ye Bin's words, Lu Qian Xing's heart also wavered a little.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 171: Don't Look Back\n\nOnce everyone agreed, Ye Bin and his group proceeded towards the unknown forest ahead. Just as they were about to enter, Ye Bin, to prevent them from scattering again, came up with an idea.\n\n\"Let's hold hands!\"\n\n\"A bunch of grown men holding hands... it feels a bit strange!\" When Ye Bin suggested they all hold hands while moving forward in the forest, everyone felt resistant.\n\n\"Yeah! Binzi, the thought of that scene, just imagining it, gives me goosebumps!\" Chen Hui said, holding his forehead. The image of them holding hands and entering the forest made him feel a thousand goosebumps.\n\n\"While the idea is good, if there's a better way, like finding a rope or something to tie everyone's hands together, I think it would be better.\" Although Zhang Lan didn't dismiss Ye Bin's idea, he felt that tying their hands together with a rope would be more aesthetically pleasing than holding hands.\n\n\"I also agree with tying our hands together, but the problem now is that we don't have any rope,\" Lu Qianxing offered his opinion. He preferred Zhang Lan's idea over Ye Bin's.\n\n\"If we don't have rope, we can use branches as a substitute. Holding onto one end of a branch and moving forward should also work,\" Chen Hui suggested, picking up a slender branch from the ground. He then held one end of the branch and offered the other end to Ye Bin.\n\n\"Branches are too easy to break, that won't work,\" Ye Bin said, as the branch snapped in half with a slight tug.\n\n\"If it's rope, would my shoelaces work?\" Zhang Lan, wearing athletic shoes with laces, asked as he squatted down to untie his shoelaces.\n\n\"Lan Ge, I refuse!\" Chen Hui stared at Zhang Lan, speaking coldly.\n\n\"Why!\" Zhang Lan looked up, his expression puzzled as he looked at Chen Hui.\n\n\"I'm afraid I'll faint,\" Chen Hui said very seriously.\n\n\"...\" Zhang Lan's gaze sharpened, and his face instantly darkened. \"You brat, what do you mean by that!\"\n\n\"I think Ye Bin's method is more appropriate. If we only use a rope, we might not notice if it breaks. But if we hold hands, it's a different story,\" Lin Xiao, who hadn't participated in the discussion, suddenly spoke up, agreeing with Ye Bin's method.\n\n\"But, a bunch of grown men holding hands, this... it's too much!\" Chen Hui wore a helpless smile on his face.\n\n\"At a time like this, we don't have time to consider other things,\" Ye Bin said coldly, looking sternly at Chen Hui.\n\nSeeing Ye Bin's expression, Chen Hui awkwardly smiled and stopped making any further remarks. \"I'll listen to the organization and obey all of its arrangements.\"\n\n\"Binzi is right. At a time like this, there's no time to consider other things. To ensure safety, I also agree, let's hold hands!\" Zhang Lan pondered for a moment and finally felt that Ye Bin's method was the most sensible.\n\nLu Qianxing shrugged, adopting a nonchalant attitude.\n\nFinally, to prevent being separated again, Ye Bin and his four companions, with their fingers interlocked, held hands and proceeded into the unknown forest ahead.\n\n\"This scene is truly unbearable to look at!\" Chen Hui, standing between Ye Bin and Zhang Lan, sighed as he looked at everyone on either side with their fingers interlocked.\n\n\"Everyone be careful. I didn't sense anything from afar, but now that we're close, I can feel a very terrifying yin energy,\" Lu Qianxing said, his expression darkening as he gazed at the forest ahead.\n\n\"Are we really going in?\" Even though Chen Hui was in the center of the group, he felt an inexplicable sense of unease as he looked into the dark forest ahead.\n\n\"You brat, you're in the middle, and you're still so timid! Want to switch?\" Zhang Lan rolled his eyes at Chen Hui and said coldly.\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Chen Hui chuckled and quickly shut his mouth.\n\nThe five people, from left to right, were Lin Xiao, Ye Bin, Chen Hui, Zhang Lan, and Lu Qianxing.\n\nWith their fingers interlocked and holding hands, the five of them stepped forward in unison into the unknown forest.\n\nMeanwhile, Old Xu and the other three sat together, with talismans given by Lu Qianxing stuck to their foreheads, remaining still and awaiting rescue from Ye Bin and the others.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, is there anything strange behind me?\" Zheng Tian felt a chill on his back, always feeling like something was staring at him. Several times, he couldn't help but want to turn around, but remembering Lu Qianxing's warning and the terrifying scenes from movies in his mind, he resisted.\n\n\"No, don't worry, don't think too much,\" Old Xu comforted him, seeing that Zheng Tian's emotions were a bit unstable at the moment.\n\n\"Old Xu, are we just going to sit here and wait? What if Binzi and the others are in trouble and need our help?\" Zhao Zhen, worried about Ye Bin and his group, asked Old Xu.\n\n\"Binzi and the others have Qianxing with them, so there shouldn't be any problem. As for us, apart from the talismans Qianxing left, we have nothing. If we encounter anything, it will be troublesome, so we shouldn't take risks. It's best to wait here quietly,\" Although Old Xu was also worried about the safety of Ye Bin and his group, he knew that compared to them, his own group was in more danger.\n\n\"Uncle Xu! Something just seemed to dart past behind you!\" As Zhao Zhen and Old Xu were talking, Zheng Tian suddenly exclaimed in fear, cold sweat constantly trickling down his forehead.\n\nHearing Zheng Tian's words, everyone shivered and then felt like something terrible was staring at them from behind.\n\n\"Xiao Tian, close your eyes, don't look! Absolutely do not turn around!\" Although Old Xu was also very scared, he was relatively calmer than the others. He quickly spoke up, pacifying Zheng Tian, afraid that Zheng Tian might suddenly turn around at this moment.\n\n\"Uncle Xu, I... I saw it too, it looked like... that little girl!\" Ning Hua said, trembling, and then fearfully swallowed.\n\n\"Old Xu! What should we do now!\" Upon hearing about the little girl, Zhao Zhen's expression also turned panicked.\n\n\"Close your eyes!\" Old Xu commanded sternly.\n\nHearing this, everyone didn't dare to hesitate and instantly closed their eyes. However, the moment they closed their eyes, they felt like someone was standing behind them, getting closer and closer.\n\n\"Old Xu! There seems to be someone behind me!\"\n\n\"Uncle Xu! Are we going to be okay?\" Zheng Tian's voice trembled, giving the impression that he was about to cry.\n\nOld Xu tightly closed his eyes, trying to calm his fear, and slowly said, \"Everyone, don't be afraid, believe that Qianxing's talismans will protect you. Whatever happens, don't open your eyes, don't look back! You must believe that Qianxing and the others will come to save us!\"\n\n(End of this chapter)",

Yesterday was our daughter's birthday! She waited for you by the cake all night! Other fathers can drop everything and spend their daughter's birthday with her, but you? In all these years, have you ever celebrated your daughter's birthday? I even doubt if you remember her birthday!\"\n\n\"Xu Jiang! Do you even have us, mother and daughter, in your heart? What do we mean to you?\"\n\n\"Xu Jiang! I hate you! Why did I choose you! Why! If God gave me another chance, I'd rather not have known you!\"\n\n\"In this life, I've never asked anything of you. This time, even if I beg you, please take care of our daughter. She's already lost one love; I don't want her to lose another.\"\n\n\"Xu Jiang! I don't have a father like you! If it weren't for you, Mom wouldn't have left! I hate you! I hate you!\"\n\nAs Old Xu closed his eyes, past scenes flashed before him like a movie.\n\nOld Xu, who had been urging everyone to close their eyes, suddenly opened them. The past scenes vanished, and everything returned to reality. Old Xu's gaze swept over Zhao Zhen and the other two. All three were now with their eyes tightly shut, their faces contorted in pain.\n\n\"Mom! I'm sorry! It's my fault! It's my fault! I'm sorry! Please don't go! Don't go!\" Tears streamed down Ning Hua's face as she was clearly lost in a sorrowful memory.\n\n\"I'm not afraid! I'm not afraid! I've never been afraid!\" Zheng Tian muttered, shaking his head as if denying something.\n\n\"Son! Why haven't you come back yet! You said you'd come back to celebrate the New Year with Dad this year! Next year? Okay, Dad will wait for you. If you have time, call Dad more often.\" Zhao Zhen said with a face full of disappointment, tears slowly tracing paths down his cheeks.\n\nSeeing the state of Zhao Zhen and the other two, and recalling the scenes he had witnessed when he closed his eyes, Old Xu suddenly understood something. Just then, behind Zhao Zhen, who was sitting opposite him, Old Xu vaguely saw a blurry figure.\n\nOld Xu, who was initially afraid, was about to close his eyes and look away when a gentle and familiar voice sounded, causing him to widen his eyes in an instant.\n\n\"Xu Jiang, are you alright?\" As the voice spoke, the blurry figure behind Zhao Zhen gradually became clearer. When Old Xu saw the figure coming into focus, he froze on the spot. The next moment, tears involuntarily welled up in his eyes and began to flow.\n\n\"A Yue? Is that you?\" The fear in his heart vanished, and Old Xu softly asked the figure. At this moment, Old Xu's heart was solely focused on the figure behind Zhao Zhen, with everything else cast aside.\n\n\"It's me! It's been a long time. Are you alright?\" The figure Old Xu called \"A Yue\" smiled, her face displaying a smile that captivated Old Xu.\n\n\"Really! It's really you!\" Old Xu exclaimed excitedly, trying to get up and move towards the figure behind Zhao Zhen. But the moment he tried to stand, the talisman on his forehead trembled slightly. Then, Old Xu felt a terrifying force pressing down on him, rendering him unable to stand.\n\n\"What's going on! Why can't I stand!\" Old Xu exclaimed anxiously, trying to get up but finding himself unable to control his body, his legs stiff and immobile.\n\nThe talisman on Old Xu's forehead flashed with a dazzling white light. In the next instant, Old Xu, who was anxiously trying to stand, suddenly paused, then snapped out of his daze.\n\n\"No! You're not A Yue! Who are you!\" Alerted by the talisman, Old Xu suddenly remembered that they had been in danger earlier. He then fixed his gaze on the figure behind Zhao Zhen and asked coldly.\n\n\"I am A Yue! Don't you remember me?\" The figure behind Zhao Zhen looked at Old Xu with tender affection, her voice filled with a wronged tone.\n\n\"No! You're not A Yue!\" With the help of the talisman, Old Xu, having regained his senses, was clear-headed. He knew that the figure behind Zhao Zhen was not the woman in his heart.\n\n\"Are you going to ignore me again? Are you going to abandon us, mother and daughter, here again?\" The figure behind Zhao Zhen spoke, lowering her head in distress.\n\n\"Dad! When will you celebrate my birthday with me?\" A childish voice rang out from behind Old Xu. Immediately, Old Xu felt someone standing behind him.\n\nThe moment he heard the childish voice, Old Xu almost turned around. If it weren't for the talisman flashing its blinding light again to alert him, Old Xu couldn't imagine the terrible things that might have happened next.\n\n\"Xu Jiang! Why did you kill my mother! Why! You executioner!\" An enraged voice echoed, and another figure appeared beside the figure behind Zhao Zhen. The moment he saw the newly appeared figure, Old Xu clenched his fists, took a deep breath, and tried his best to suppress the urge to rush forward, muttering to himself as a warning.\n\n\"Fake! It's all fake! Everything is fake!\" Old Xu gritted his teeth and tightly closed his eyes, refusing to look at the two figures behind Zhao Zhen.\n\nBut the moment Old Xu closed his eyes, past scenes played out in his mind like a movie.\n\n\"Xu Jiang!\"\n\n\"Xu Jiang!\"\n\n\"Dad!\"\n\n\"Dad!\"\n\nTwo different voices called out to Old Xu alternately. For a moment, Old Xu felt an unbearable headache, unable to distinguish reality from illusion.\n\n\"Dad, celebrate my birthday with me!\"\n\n\"Xu Jiang! Are you going to abandon us, mother and daughter, again!\"\n\n\"Xu Jiang! You killed my mother! It's all your fault! It's all your fault!\"\n\nThree figures surrounded Old Xu, speaking incessantly, eroding his will and pushing his mind to the brink of collapse.\n\n\"Fake! Fake! It's all fake! None of it is real! It's all fake!\" Old Xu muttered, resisting the surrounding voices. However, the voices seemed to be etched into his mind, gradually robbing him of his ability to think.\n\nThe talisman continued to flash with a dazzling light, but this time, Old Xu did not regain consciousness. His body involuntarily stood up, and then, his eyes slowly opened.\n\nAt this moment, Old Xu's eyes were vacant, and he was in a daze.\n\nThe talisman on Old Xu's forehead slipped off, and then, Old Xu slowly turned his body.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 173: A Good Father\n\n\"Lao Xu!\"\n\nJust as Lao Xu was getting up and about to turn around, a hand firmly grabbed him. Lao Xu, who had been in a daze, snapped back to reality at that moment.\n\n\"Lao Zhao!\"\n\nLao Xu opened his eyes and saw Zhao Zhen, gritting his teeth and tightly clutching his sleeve.\n\n\"Qian Xing said not to look back! Lao Xu! Wake up! If you turn back, it's over!\" Zhao Zhen gritted his teeth, his expression filled with pain, sweat dripping from his forehead.\n\n\"Lao Zhao.\" Seeing Zhao Zhen's pained expression, Lao Xu was a little stunned. He didn't know what was happening or why Zhao Zhen had suddenly woken up and pulled him back when he was about to fall into the abyss.\n\n\"I don't know what you're seeing! But, Lao Xu! It's all fake! Don't be fooled by those illusions! Wake up quickly.\" Zhao Zhen roared, his voice becoming hoarse.\n\n\"Am I awake? Don't I?...\" Lao Xu muttered to himself, then suspiciously spread his hands. \"What! What's going on!\" The moment Lao Xu spread his hands, he first saw a paper talisman that had fallen to the ground at some point, and then he noticed that his hands, for some reason, had become very blurry.\n\n\"Lao Xu!\" Zhao Zhen's desperate cry rang out again. Lao Xu's body was still slowly turning, but at this moment, Lao Xu realized he couldn't control his body.\n\n\"What! What's happening!\" Discovering that he couldn't control his body, Lao Xu was completely stunned. Then, Lao Xu looked down to check his body, and the moment he lowered his head, Lao Xu felt a wave of dizziness, followed by Lao Xu seeing himself become a blurry phantom, separated from his body.\n\nThe moment he realized he was separated from his body, Lao Xu finally understood why the Zhao Zhen in front of him was desperately holding onto his sleeve and shouting at him to wake up.\n\n\"Why did it turn out like this? Could it be? Am I out of my body right now?\" Combining the current situation, Lao Xu thought of a scene often depicted in supernatural movies: soul projection.\n\n\"Xu Jiang! What are you still standing there for? Let's go.\" A familiar voice came from behind Lao Xu. Lao Xu instinctively wanted to turn his head, but at the critical moment, Lao Xu managed to control himself.\n\n\"Dad! We should go!\" A childish voice urged Lao Xu, but Lao Xu, now in a spiritual state, still didn't turn his head.\n\nAlthough Lao Xu in his soul state didn't turn his head, Lao Xu's body turned around, and started to walk away, but because Zhao Zhen was stubbornly holding onto Lao Xu's sleeve, Lao Xu's body remained in place.\n\n\"Lao Zhao! Lao Zhao!\" Lao Xu, in his soul state, spoke anxiously, calling out to Zhao Zhen while waving his hands in front of him. However, no matter how much he called out or waved, Zhao Zhen couldn't hear or see him.\n\n\"How can this be! Lao Zhao! I'm here! I'm here! Can you hear me!\" Lao Xu desperately called out Zhao Zhen's name, his expression becoming panicked.\n\n\"Lao Xu! Wake up! You can't go! You can't go!\" Zhao Zhen gritted his teeth, veins bulging on his forehead.\n\nLooking at Zhao Zhen's pained expression, Lao Xu felt his eyes moisten. When had it been that the old friend who always liked to argue with him and go against him was now risking his life to save him?\n\n\"Lao Zhao!\" Lao Xu gritted his teeth, wanting to stop Zhao Zhen, but as a soul, he could do nothing at the moment.\n\n\"Xu Jiang! You've already harmed us mother and daughter, are you going to harm your best friend too?\"\n\n\"Dad, let's go! If you don't go now, this uncle will be in danger.\" Behind Zhao Zhen, a little girl suddenly appeared. The little girl was wearing a black dress and holding a knife, which she held to Zhao Zhen's neck.\n\n\"You! It's you!\" When he saw the little girl, Lao Xu recognized her at a glance. It was the little girl he had seen in the bronze coffin in Blackwater Village.\n\n\"Heh heh! Uncle recognized me.\" The little girl tilted her head, a chilling smile on her face.\n\nAt this moment, even Lao Xu in his soul state trembled and shivered fiercely upon seeing the little girl's chilling smile.\n\n\"Uncle! Auntie is still waiting for you. Let's go. Otherwise, I'll have to take this uncle with me.\" The little girl said with a smile, gently moving the knife at Zhao Zhen's neck. The next moment, a terrible scene flashed before Lao Xu's eyes.\n\nBlood seeped out, and Zhao Zhen collapsed in a pool of blood.\n\n\"No!\" Lao Xu shouted, trying to stop the knife in the little girl's hand from cutting Zhao Zhen's neck.\n\n\"Then let's go! Uncle! Auntie is still waiting for us!\" The little girl said with a smile. The originally sweet smile now seemed so terrifying to Lao Xu.\n\n\"Lao Zhao!\" Lao Xu took a deep look at Zhao Zhen, gritted his teeth, and then turned away. The moment Lao Xu turned, he felt his soul return to his body. Feeling the force of Zhao Zhen pulling his sleeve, Lao Xu exerted a strong pull, tearing a gap in Zhao Zhen's sleeve. Zhao Zhen's body fell backward, sitting on the ground.\n\n\"Lao Xu! Don't! Don't! Come back! Come back!\" Zhao Zhen cried out, trying to get up and grab Lao Xu again, but an invisible force seemed to be pressing down on his body, making it impossible for him to move no matter how hard he tried.\n\n\"Lao Zhao, tell my daughter, if there's a next life, I will definitely be a good father.\"\n\nLao Xu's voice reached Zhao Zhen's ears. Zhao Zhen froze in place. \"Lao Xu! Don't! Don't!\" Zhao Zhen roared, reaching out with both hands to try and grab Lao Xu, but at this moment, Lao Xu had already started to walk forward slowly. In less than a moment, Lao Xu's figure disappeared into the darkness.\n\n\"Lao Xu! Lao Xu! Don't go, don't go...\" Zhao Zhen's voice gradually faded, until only the sound of painful sobs remained.\n\nAt the same time, Ye Bin and his group, who had just entered the forest, had not taken a few steps when Ye Bin suddenly shivered and then froze in place.\n\n\"Bin Zi, what's wrong?\" Seeing Ye Bin stop, the group walking hand in hand also stopped with Ye Bin.\n\n\"Bin Zi, your face doesn't look too good!\" Chen Hui asked curiously, noticing that Ye Bin's face was a little pale, as if something had happened.\n\n\"Just now, for a moment, I felt a chill all over. Could it be that Uncle Xu and the others are in trouble!\" Ye Bin frowned, his voice a little anxious.\n\n\"Bin Zi, don't worry. They have the talisman given by Qian Xing, they'll be fine!\" Zhang Lan said, trying to comfort Ye Bin.\n\n\"That's right, Bin Zi. Have faith in Uncle Xu. Last time, Uncle Xu led us out of the predicament!\" Chen Hui added.\n\n\"I just feel, suddenly, a little uneasy in my heart, as if something has happened.\"\n\n\"It's just a feeling, right? Don't worry! Uncle Xu and the others will be fine! On the other hand, we need to speed up and find them quickly to rendezvous with them.\"\n\nYe Bin did not answer Zhang Lan's words, only nodded, and then continued to walk forward into the depths of the forest.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 174: The Road Deep in the Woods\n\n\"Binzi, do you feel like the weather is getting a bit colder?\" Not long after entering the woods, Chen Hui felt the surrounding temperature dropping rapidly.\n\n\"Mhm, I feel it too, the temperature has clearly lowered,\" Zhang Lan answered before Ye Bin could even speak.\n\n\"Everyone be careful, don't get separated,\" Lu Qianxing said with a solemn expression, his gaze constantly scanning the surroundings. After feeling the sharp drop in temperature, Lu Qianxing had a bad premonition that something was about to emerge from the shadows.\n\n\"Qianxing, I always feel like there's something following us from behind.\" As they advanced through the woods, Ye Bin always had the feeling that something was persistently trailing their group.\n\n\"Me too, I always feel like a pair of eyes are staring at me from behind, making my entire back feel cold,\" Chen Hui said, shivering.\n\n\"Keep moving, don't look back, and also, try to avoid looking around aimlessly,\" Lu Qianxing said sternly, cautioning everyone.\n\nUpon hearing this, everyone nodded in understanding and proceeded forward, eyes fixed ahead.\n\nWhen they had first entered the woods, the trees were dense, hindering their progress. However, after about ten minutes, the woods suddenly opened up, leaving a road in the center wide enough for two cars to drive side-by-side.\n\n\"Binzi, it looks like this isn't the woods near Blackwater Village,\" Zhang Lan recalled that the woods near Blackwater Village did have a road in the center, but it wasn't as wide as the one they were seeing now.\n\nYe Bin nodded; he had also noticed that while the current woods shared some similarities with those near Blackwater Village, they weren't identical. \"Although they are somewhat similar, with a road in the center of the woods, this road is clearly different from the one near Blackwater Village. This road is full of potholes and isn't suitable for vehicles, unlike the road near Blackwater Village, which was quite flat and posed no issue for vehicles,\" Ye Bin judged, looking at the potholes on the ground.\n\n\"In that case, the 'Route 18' bus shouldn't appear here, right?\" Chen Hui thought that since the road wasn't suitable for vehicles, it meant the \"Route 18\" bus wouldn't appear in these woods.\n\n\"Indeed, the woods near Blackwater Village had tire tracks, but we haven't found any signs of vehicles having passed through here,\" Zhang Lan added.\n\n\"But, Binzi, I still have a question. Although it's different from the woods near Blackwater Village, the road in the middle must have been man-made, right? If it's not for vehicles, then what is this road for?\" Chen Hui asked, looking at Ye Bin with a frown.\n\n\"Leaving a road in the middle of the woods is indeed a bit baffling,\" Zhang Lan murmured, sharing Chen Hui's doubt.\n\n\"If we walk further, we might discover something. Perhaps this is the road leading to that village,\" Ye Bin speculated that the current road seemed more like a rudimentary country path.\n\n\"The sides of the road are overgrown with weeds, but the center of the road, despite being muddy and full of potholes, has no weeds at all. Don't you find that strange?\" Lin Xiao, who had been silent until now, suddenly spoke, causing everyone to pause.\n\n\"Indeed, according to our observations, this place should not have been traveled by anyone for a long time. Therefore, the center of the road should be overgrown with weeds just like the sides. But now, there are no weeds in the center of the road,\" Ye Bin also noticed the strangeness after Lin Xiao's reminder. Places that are frequently walked upon don't grow weeds, but once they are left untouched for a long time, weeds quickly appear.\n\n\"In that case, that makes sense,\" Chen Hui agreed, nodding based on Lin Xiao's words and Ye Bin's explanation.\n\nAs everyone pondered why the road, despite not being walked upon, still lacked weeds, Lu Qianxing broke their silence with a solemn tone.\n\n\"Have you ever heard of 'Ghost Soldiers Borrowing the Road'?\"\n\n\"Ghost Soldiers Borrowing the Road!\" Upon hearing Lu Qianxing's words, everyone's expression, except for Lin Xiao's, instantly turned grim.\n\n\"Ghost Soldiers Borrowing the Road: legend has it that whenever a region experiences a disaster and a large number of deaths occur, due to the sheer number of deceased, the underworld dispatches ghost officers to collect souls. These ghost officers are called 'ghost soldiers,' and the path they take with the souls of the deceased is referred to as 'Ghost Soldiers Borrowing the Road',\" Lin Xiao explained calmly, giving everyone a brief description of \"Ghost Soldiers Borrowing the Road.\"\n\n\"So, is it because of 'Ghost Soldiers Borrowing the Road' that nothing grows here?\" As soon as Lin Xiao finished speaking, Chen Hui had an idea.\n\n\"If it's 'Ghost Soldiers Borrowing the Road,' then are the souls of the deceased being led by the ghost soldiers the souls of the villagers from Blackwater Village?\" Ye Bin also made a connection, speculating that the reason for the ghost soldiers' appearance might be related to the disaster in Blackwater Village.\n\n\"Wait! If that's the case! Was the village we just passed really Blackwater Village?\" Zhang Lan suddenly looked stunned, a hint of confusion on his face.\n\n\"That's not right! If it was Blackwater Village, then where are the graves and tombstones?\" Chen Hui frowned, looking at Zhang Lan.\n\n\"Qianxing, can you explain what's going on?\" Ye Bin's gaze shifted to Lu Qianxing. Ye Bin felt that among them, only Lu Qianxing could explain the current situation.\n\n\"We're probably not far from Blackwater Village, so it's possible for ghost soldiers to pass through here,\" Lin Xiao also made a guess, then cast his gaze towards Lu Qianxing.\n\nLu Qianxing's face was solemn as he fell into thought. When he heard Ye Bin and Lin Xiao's words, Lu Qianxing first shook his head, then slowly spoke, \"I'm also confused at the moment. However, it is indeed possible for ghost soldiers to pass through here. But there's another issue: the fire in Blackwater Village happened five years ago. If ghost soldiers were borrowing the road five years ago, and it's still like this five years later, that doesn't quite add up.\" The fire in Blackwater Village occurred five years ago, and even if ghost soldiers borrowed the road, it should have been five years ago. However, based on Lu Qianxing's understanding of \"Ghost Soldiers Borrowing the Road,\" such a long time should mean it no longer affects this place.\n\n\"Judging by the situation here, it seems to have been like this for a long time. Could it be that ghost soldiers have been borrowing the road here all along? Or perhaps this road has some special significance?\" Ye Bin mused, his understanding of ghost soldiers being purely speculative, unable to make any definitive judgments.\n\n\"Could it be that a disaster just happened here, and it just happened to coincide with Ghost Soldiers Borrowing the Road?\" Chen Hui muttered, a bold idea forming in his mind.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 175: The Terrifying Little Girl\n\nDeep within the woods, Ye Bin and his four companions walked hand in hand. As the sky grew darker, everyone could clearly feel the temperature around them dropping rapidly once again.\n\n\"The weather seems to be getting colder again,\" Zhang Lan shivered involuntarily, feeling a chilling cold.\n\n\"Am I imagining things? Do you guys see people walking towards us from up ahead?\" Chen Hui stared straight ahead, swallowing hard, a deep fear rising in his heart.\n\n\"Everyone keep walking. It's all an illusion. No matter what you see, stay calm and don't pay any attention to it.\" As soon as Chen Hui finished speaking, Lu Qianxing, with a grim expression, cautioned everyone.\n\n\"Qianxing, they seem to be carrying a coffin!\" Not long after the group continued walking, more than a dozen figures in white mourning clothes appeared in the distance.\n\nAnd among the more than a dozen figures in white mourning clothes, eight burly men were carrying a coffin, slowly approaching the group.\n\n\"I feel like I've seen that coffin somewhere before,\" Ye Bin's gaze fixed on the coffin carried by the eight strong men, and he spoke softly.\n\n\"It's the bronze coffin from Blackwater Village!\" Hearing Ye Bin's reminder, Zhang Lan also realized that the coffin carried by the eight strong men looked very familiar. The next moment, upon seeing the coffin clearly, Zhang Lan recognized it at once as the \"bronze coffin\" that had previously buried the little girl in Blackwater Village.\n\nWhile the group was discussing, the more than a dozen figures in mourning clothes in the distance were already close.\n\n\"Walk normally, don't pay attention.\" Lu Qianxing cautioned everyone again. As his voice fell, Ye Bin and his four companions, holding hands, moved forward in unison.\n\nAs the more than a dozen figures in mourning clothes drew near, cold sweat dripped from everyone's foreheads. Especially Chen Hui, the sweat on his forehead was like tears, soaking his entire cheeks.\n\n\"Chen Hui, if you're scared, close your eyes. We'll lead you through!\" Ye Bin felt Chen Hui's fear because at that moment, he could feel Chen Hui's hand trembling slightly as he held it.\n\nHearing Ye Bin's words, Chen Hui didn't think much of it and immediately closed his eyes.\n\nThe two groups met, and neither avoided the other. Just as everyone thought they were about to collide with the dozens of figures in mourning clothes, a surprising scene unfolded. The dozens of figures in mourning clothes were like ghosts, passing through their bodies the moment they were about to collide.\n\nIn that instant, everyone understood Lu Qianxing's previous warning: \"It's all an illusion.\"\n\n\"Is this really just an illusion?\" Zhang Lan murmured to himself, deeply shocked by what he was seeing. It seemed so real, yet it was merely an illusion.\n\nAfter passing through the figures in mourning clothes, the group approached the bronze coffin carried by the eight strong men.\n\n\"Hehehe. Hehehe.\"\n\nThe moment they got close to the bronze coffin, a chilling laughter echoed in their ears. Then, the group vaguely saw that inside the bronze coffin, there seemed to be a person lying down.\n\nJust when everyone thought the little girl was lying in the bronze coffin, their bodies passed through the coffin. And the moment their bodies passed through the coffin, they vaguely saw that the person lying inside was not the little girl they had guessed.\n\nUpon seeing the person lying in the bronze coffin, except for Chen Hui, who had his eyes closed, everyone's footsteps stopped in unison. Then, their gazes froze, and their faces turned extremely grim.\n\n\"Calm down, it's all an illusion.\" Lu Qianxing was the first to recover. After regaining his composure, Lu Qianxing spoke softly, reminding everyone.\n\n\"I don't think that's an illusion,\" Ye Bin said with a grim expression. He had a strong premonition that the person lying in the bronze coffin was not an illusion, but the real \"Old Xu.\"\n\n\"Qianxing, is it really just an illusion? I also feel that the person lying in the bronze coffin might really be Old Xu.\" Although everything around felt somewhat illusory, Zhang Lan felt that the person in the bronze coffin was so real.\n\n\"Hehehe. Hehehe.\" While everyone was still pondering whether the person in the bronze coffin was Old Xu, the chilling laughter sounded again. Then, at the very end of the dozens of figures in mourning clothes, Ye Bin and his group saw a little girl, tilting her head and smiling at them with a \"naive\" expression.\n\n\"Take out the talismans I gave you and stick them on your foreheads! Quickly!\" Lu Qianxing suddenly shouted, then pulled out a talisman from his pocket and quickly stuck it on his forehead.\n\nAt the same time, Ye Bin and his group let go of their clasped hands, each drawing a talisman previously given by Lu Qianxing from their pockets and instantly sticking it on their foreheads.\n\n\"Qianxing! What happened!\" Chen Hui, with his eyes closed, finished the action of taking out a talisman from his pocket and sticking it on his forehead, without opening his eyes at all.\n\nYe Bin did not answer Chen Hui's question but reached out to hold Chen Hui's hand again. \"Everyone hold hands, don't separate!\"\n\nAfter Ye Bin spoke, the group's released hands instantly clasped together again.\n\n\"Hehehe, are you here to play with me?\" A childish voice rang out. The little girl in front of everyone suddenly spoke, tilting her head as she spoke, revealing a confused expression.\n\nYe Bin and the others remained silent in response to the little girl's question. Except for Chen Hui, who had his eyes closed, everyone else stared at the little girl in front of them with caution.\n\n\"Why aren't you playing with me! You're all bad people.\" The little girl suddenly pouted and spoke, then revealed a ferocious smile.\n\nSeeing the ferocious smile on the little girl's face, everyone involuntarily shivered.\n\n\"Anyone who doesn't play with me is a bad person! I want you to stay with me forever!\" The first half of the sentence was spoken in the voice of a young girl, but in the latter half, the little girl's voice became deep and oppressive.\n\n\"Oh no!\" As soon as the little girl finished speaking, Ye Bin and his group saw several figures in mourning clothes, holding suonas, gongs, and other musical instruments, playing funeral music behind the little girl.\n\nAs the funeral music began, countless paper money suddenly fell from the sky.\n\nSeeing this, Lu Qianxing fumbled to take something out of his pocket, but the next moment, before Lu Qianxing could retrieve what he needed, five dark, upright coffins appeared behind Ye Bin and his group.\n\nThe coffin lids opened, and a terrifying suction force separated the five of them. They were all simultaneously sucked into the dark coffins behind them. Then, the coffin lids closed. Amidst the little girl's chilling laughter, everything disappeared, leaving only five dark coffins in the middle of the road.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 176 Being imprisoned",
    "content": "Chapter 176: Trapped in a Cage\n\nDarkness enveloped everything. Ye Bin and the other four, sucked into a pitch-black coffin, found themselves in the center of a deserted intersection.\n\nHigh-rise buildings lined the four sides of the intersection, with large shopping malls connected one after another. Coupled with the dazzling array of shops on the street corners, it was clear that this was once a very prosperous area. However, at this moment, besides the countless buildings, this prime location held only the five individuals, Ye Bin and his companions.\n\n\"Are we trapped in an illusion?\" Ye Bin questioned as he looked at the unfamiliar surroundings.\n\n\"I remember we were sucked into the coffin before. How did we suddenly appear here?\" Chen Hui's gaze continuously scanned the surroundings. He only remembered being sucked into a dark coffin, after which his consciousness felt blurry. When he regained consciousness, he was already standing at the center of the intersection with Ye Bin and the others.\n\n\"If this is an illusion, are we lying in the coffin right now?\" Zhang Lan frowned, feeling very uneasy.\n\nAs everyone was in doubt, Lu Qianxing suddenly fumbled through his clothes with a grim expression. The talismans and magical artifacts he had carried were all inexplicably gone.\n\n\"The illusion-breaking bell is gone, and all my talismans have also disappeared,\" Lu Qianxing said in a deep voice, his face looking somewhat heavy.\n\n\"Does that mean we can't prove whether we're trapped in an illusion or not?\" Upon hearing Lu Qianxing's words, Chen Hui immediately felt that things were not looking good.\n\n\"In such a prosperous area, with no people around, it seems we must have fallen into an illusion,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, his gaze slowly moving around the surroundings, as if searching for something.\n\n\"I remember that little girl saying before that she wanted us to stay and accompany her forever. Does that mean she wants to trap us in this illusion forever?\" Zhang Lan murmured, then turned her gaze to Lu Qianxing.\n\nLu Qianxing's face was grim, and he felt somewhat anxious. Without any talismans or magical artifacts, Lu Qianxing was powerless to deal with the current situation.\n\n\"If that little girl only wanted to trap us in this illusion forever, does that mean we are not in mortal danger for the time being?\" Ye Bin analyzed the situation the group was currently facing.\n\n\"We should all be trapped in the coffin right now. I remember the lid was closed before we lost consciousness. If the lid was closed, there would be no oxygen, and we would soon suffocate.\" The thought of being trapped in the coffin made Zhang Lan feel that they were in a life-or-death situation.\n\n\"If the coffin lid is closed and there's no oxygen, then we're not trapped in an illusion, but we're already dead, with only our souls trapped here,\" Lu Qianxing directly denied Zhang Lan's concern.\n\n\"Qianxing, are we not already...\" Hearing Lu Qianxing's words, Chen Hui shivered and then looked at Lu Qianxing fearfully.\n\n\"Don't worry, our current state is not that of souls.\" Although all the talismans and magical artifacts had disappeared, Lu Qianxing could still judge based on his own abilities that they were not souls.\n\nReceiving Lu Qianxing's affirmation, Chen Hui breathed a sigh of relief. \"Phew, I thought we were dead for sure.\"\n\n\"Although we are indeed alive now, I can't guarantee that everyone won't encounter danger if it drags on for too long.\" Without talismans and magical artifacts, relying only on his own abilities, Lu Qianxing could not think of any way to escape the current predicament.\n\n\"We must find a way to break free from the illusion now, otherwise, not only us, but even Uncle Xu and the others are likely in grave danger.\" Ye Bin did not believe that Old Xu's group could escape unharmed after encountering that terrifying little girl. Moreover, when they were sucked into the coffin, Ye Bin clearly remembered that Old Xu was lying in the bronze coffin carried by the eight strong men.\n\n\"Speaking of which, Qianxing, was Old Xu really lying in that coffin? Why do I feel like the person lying in the coffin is indeed Old Xu?\" Zhang Lan recalled the scene of seeing the bronze coffin, and she also had a feeling that the person lying in the coffin was indeed Old Xu himself.\n\n\"I can't be sure, but I personally think it should just be an illusion,\" Lu Qianxing could not give a definitive answer either.\n\n\"Regardless of whether it's Uncle Xu or not, our primary goal now is to find a way to get out of here. Otherwise, even if we confirm it's Uncle Xu, we won't be able to do anything,\" Ye Bin understood that the biggest problem they faced now was how to escape the illusion.\n\n\"All the talismans and magical artifacts have disappeared. Relying solely on my abilities, I'm afraid...\" Lu Qianxing bit his lip at this point, a look of self-blame on his face. \"If only I were a little stronger, perhaps...\"\n\n\"There are no 'what ifs.' This is not the time for self-recrimination. Think of a way, see if you can find anything,\" Lin Xiao said, advising Lu Qianxing. Meanwhile, his own gaze never wavered, constantly observing the surroundings and searching for clues.\n\nUpon hearing Lin Xiao's words, the others stopped talking, nodded, and split up to investigate around the road.\n\n\"Is this really an illusion? Everything is too real!\" When Zhang Lan walked up to the entrance of a shopping mall, she looked at everything inside through the locked doors and couldn't help but sigh.\n\n\"I just tried pinching myself, and I clearly felt pain! If everything was an illusion, then pinching myself shouldn't hurt, right?\" Chen Hui rubbed his arm and looked at Lu Qianxing with a confused expression.\n\nLu Qianxing could only give an awkward smile to Chen Hui's question; he couldn't provide a reasonable explanation either.\n\n\"Binzi, according to the method we used in Blackwater Village before, can we escape this predicament?\" Since they had fallen into an illusion in Blackwater Village before, Zhang Lan wondered if they could break free using the same method.\n\n\"Impossible!\" Lu Qianxing directly denied Zhang Lan's idea before Ye Bin could speak.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"The illusion last time was just a simple hallucination. However, this time, this illusion has some sort of commonality with our consciousness. If we get hurt here, it might affect our consciousness in our bodies, and that could potentially turn us into vegetative state,\" Lu Qianxing explained.\n\n\"Is it that dangerous?\" Zhang Lan pursed her lips. Upon hearing the possibility of becoming a vegetative state, she abandoned the idea.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 177: A Sense of Déjà Vu\n\n\"It's a completely dead city! I haven't seen a single person, not even animals or plants,\" Ye Bin and his group conducted a thorough investigation of all buildings within a one-kilometer radius of the intersection but found nothing.\n\n\"I have a question. Why would that little girl trap us here? I think there might be a reason,\" Chen Hui had a persistent thought during the investigation that the little girl might have trapped them in the current city for a reason.\n\n\"Reason? Probably not,\" Zhang Lan shook his head slightly, not agreeing with Chen Hui's idea. \"The other party simply wants to trap us. This illusion we're seeing might just be random.\"\n\n\"What Brother Hui said is also possible,\" Zhang Lan had just finished speaking when Lu Qianxing suddenly chimed in. Following that, everyone, including Lin Xiao, looked at Lu Qianxing with confusion.\n\n\"Qianxing, what do you mean? Chen Hui might be right? So, there's indeed a reason why we were trapped here by the other party?\" Ye Bin looked directly at Lu Qianxing, frowning as he asked.\n\nLu Qianxing nodded. \"That's also a possibility. Generally, when one falls into an illusion, it's because the other party wants the person trapped in the illusion to see certain things, thereby causing them to lose themselves.\"\n\n\"Well, back in Blackwater Village, when I was being bothered by the evil spirits, I heard my mother's voice and vaguely saw my deceased mother. If Qianxing hadn't woken me up in time, I would have lost myself then, and the consequences would have been unthinkable,\" Chen Hui recalled the events in Blackwater Village, still feeling a lingering fear. If it weren't for Qianxing waking up the returning Chen Hui at the critical moment, Chen Hui himself wouldn't dare to imagine what might have happened.\n\nAfter listening to Chen Hui's account, everyone nodded, understanding Chen Hui's previous idea.\n\n\"If that's the case, there must be some reason why we appeared in this illusion. But what is the reason? If they just wanted to make us lose ourselves, this place shouldn't be able to do that,\" Zhang Lan scanned their surroundings again. He didn't feel that there was anything here that could make him lose himself.\n\n\"Losing oneself is only one reason. There might be other reasons why we are here,\" Ye Bin murmured. He always felt that their appearance here was not because the little girl wanted them to lose themselves, but there was another reason. However, Ye Bin couldn't figure out this reason at the moment.\n\n\"Qianxing, what about you? Do you have any ideas?\" Zhang Lan looked at Lu Qianxing. At this moment, Lu Qianxing had the most say, as no one present knew more about these \"supernatural\" matters than Lu Qianxing.\n\nLu Qianxing spread his hands and gave a helpless smile. \"I'm not very clear either.\"\n\n\"If we could find the reason why the other party trapped us here, perhaps we could find a way to get out. Unfortunately, right now, we don't even know the reason they trapped us here, so it's very difficult to get out,\" Zhang Lan sighed. If even Lu Qianxing was unclear, how could anyone else figure it out?\n\n\"Detective Lin, have you found anything? I've noticed you've been observing something very carefully since a while ago. Have you discovered anything?\" Chen Hui had been paying attention to Lin Xiao. He noticed that since the beginning of their investigation, Lin Xiao had been constantly looking around, as if searching for something.\n\nHearing Chen Hui's question, everyone also focused their gaze on Lin Xiao. In fact, it wasn't just Chen Hui; everyone had noticed that Lin Xiao had been looking around, seemingly searching for something.\n\n\"I'm looking for differences,\" Lin Xiao replied calmly to everyone's questioning gazes.\n\n\"Looking for differences? What differences?\" Chen Hui scratched his head, completely not understanding what Lin Xiao said.\n\n\"Looking for differences? Have you seen this city before?\" Zhang Lan guessed that Lin Xiao, being knowledgeable, must have been to many places. Perhaps in one of the places Lin Xiao had been to, there was a city similar to this one, which was why Lin Xiao had been observing, trying to find what was the same or different about this city compared to the ones he had seen.\n\n\"No,\" Lin Xiao replied calmly, directly negating Zhang Lan's thought.\n\n\"Then what are you looking for?\" Zhang Lan's heart sank into confusion when Lin Xiao negated his idea.\n\n\"When I was investigating earlier, I noticed that although there was no one around, some things inside the buildings seemed to be changing.\" Before Lin Xiao could answer, Ye Bin spoke first, revealing his findings from his earlier investigation. At first, he thought he had misremembered, but after hearing Lin Xiao's words, Ye Bin realized his finding might be correct.\n\n\"Changing? What do you mean?\" Hearing Ye Bin's words, Zhang Lan shivered and then frowned. \"Could it be? Are there other people in this city?\"\n\n\"In the shopping mall on the west side of the intersection, on the first floor, there was originally a statue. But during the time we were investigating the surroundings, the statue disappeared. Also, the red car parked by the roadside at the north intersection changed. It moved to the south intersection during our investigation. Besides these, there are some minor changes, for example, the traffic light in front of the north intersection. Initially, the alternating time of the red and green lights should have been 70 seconds, but now it's only 50 seconds.\" Lin Xiao briefly mentioned some of his findings, which stunned Ye Bin and his group on the spot.\n\n\"My heavens! Now I understand why they call you a famous detective.\" Lu Qianxing was the person among Ye Bin's group who knew the least about Lin Xiao. But after hearing Lin Xiao's words, Lu Qianxing was completely impressed. He hadn't expected the other party's observation to be so keen; even the different alternating times of the traffic lights were noticed by Lin Xiao.\n\n\"Detective Lin! Besides these, do you have any other findings?\" Zhang Lan looked at Lin Xiao with admiration and asked.\n\n\"Have you all noticed that the surrounding buildings have a sense of déjà vu?\"\n\n\"A sense of déjà vu?\" The crowd murmured. Except for Ye Bin, everyone else shook their heads.\n\nSeeing that Ye Bin didn't shake his head, Lin Xiao turned his gaze to Ye Bin. \"Officer Ye, it seems you've already discovered something.\"\n\nYe Bin nodded slightly. \"Indeed, I also feel that these buildings have a sense of déjà vu, but I've thought about it for a long time, and I still can't figure out where this sense of déjà vu comes from.\" He sighed helplessly at the end.\n\n\"Follow me,\" Lin Xiao did not answer Ye Bin's question but signaled everyone to follow him to the north intersection.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 178 The strange statue",
    "content": "Chapter 178: Strange Statues\n\nFollowing Lin Xiao, Ye Bin and his group arrived at a shopping mall not far from the intersection. Upon entering, they saw a children's play area.\n\n\"This? A play castle?\" Looking at the play area on the first floor of the mall, which resembled a \"play castle,\" everyone turned to Lin Xiao in confusion.\n\n\"I investigated this play castle with Brother Lan before and found nothing unusual.\" Previously, Chen Hui and Zhang Lan had thoroughly searched the mall they were currently in, including the \"play castle\" before them, but they found nothing.\n\nYe Bin gazed at the \"play castle,\" feeling that since Lin Xiao brought them here, there must be something wrong.\n\n\"If I remember correctly, almost every mall has such a play castle, and they all seem to be built identically,\" Zhang Lan said, looking at the play castle, suddenly recalling something.\n\n\"Come to think of it, I have a vague impression too. It seems like every mall has a play castle, just in different locations,\" Chen Hui realized instantly with Zhang Lan's reminder.\n\n\"Even if every mall has a play castle, what does that prove? Besides, it's not that unusual for malls to have play castles,\" Lu Qianxing scratched his head, thinking that even if all malls had play castles, it wasn't strange.\n\n\"Haven't you noticed anything special about this play castle?\" Ye Bin's gaze remained fixed on the play castle, his mind now clear about Lin Xiao's purpose in bringing them here.\n\n\"Anything special? No!\" Chen Hui scanned the play castle before them, finding nothing different besides the children's play equipment.\n\n\"The statue!\" After Ye Bin's words, Zhang Lan observed more carefully and finally noticed something unusual about the statue at the entrance of the play castle.\n\n\"A statue!\" Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing looked in the direction Zhang Lan pointed and indeed saw a statue at the entrance of the \"play castle.\" The statue looked very strange, half human and the other half like a character from a cartoon.\n\n\"This statue is quite conspicuous. I didn't notice it at first.\" Seeing the strange statue, Chen Hui was somewhat surprised. Logically, he should have noticed such a bizarre and eye-catching statue immediately, but he hadn't. It was only after Zhang Lan pointed it out that he saw the strange statue.\n\n\"If there's a statue here, then it means other places should have statues too,\" Zhang Lan said, turning his gaze to Lin Xiao.\n\nLin Xiao didn't speak but nodded slightly.\n\n\"Let's go check out other malls,\" Ye Bin said, and the group left the mall for another one.\n\nUpon arriving at another mall, the \"play castle\" was not on the first floor but on the second. After going upstairs, they saw a strange statue similar to the one in the previous mall.\n\n\"This statue is a bit different from the previous one, but not significantly so.\" After investigation, they found that although the statue before them was similar to the previous one, there were still some differences.\n\nThey investigated five malls in total. Except for one mall where no statue was found, in all other malls, at the entrance of the \"play castle,\" they discovered the strange statue. After careful investigation and comparison, they also found that although these statues were similar, each one had some unique differences.\n\n\"All the play castles are basically identical, with no differences, but the statues at the entrances of these play castles are all different. What is the meaning of these statues?\" Zhang Lan murmured, deep in thought. Zhang Lan felt that the strange statues at the entrances of the play castles seemed to be hiding some secret.\n\n\"I don't know if it's just my imagination, but I feel a trace of resentment from those strange statues,\" Lu Qianxing felt a trace of resentment whenever he got close to the strange statues. But when he tried to sense it again, the resentment emanating from the statues disappeared.\n\n\"Should we smash one of the statues to see what's inside? Maybe something is hidden inside,\" Chen Hui suddenly thought, wondering if something was hidden inside those strange statues.\n\n\"No, those statues shouldn't be tampered with lightly. Although it might be just my imagination, I think there might be something inside those statues. If we smash them, we might release whatever is inside, and that would be troublesome,\" Lu Qianxing said, directly rejecting Chen Hui's idea.\n\n\"Detective Lin, what do you think about these statues?\" Ye Bin did not participate in the discussion about the statues but was concerned about Lin Xiao's opinion on the strange statues.\n\n\"These statues are also changing. Although the changes are very small, there are indeed changes. Take this statue before us, for example. There was no such symbol on the statue's arm originally, but now, this strange symbol has suddenly appeared,\" Lin Xiao said, pointing to the strange symbol on the statue's arm.\n\n\"This symbol doesn't look complete,\" Ye Bin examined the symbol on the statue's arm and found that it seemed to be only half complete. \"Qianxing, take a look. Could this symbol be some kind of curse inscription!\" Ye Bin suddenly thought of something as he looked at the symbol on the statue's arm, and then he pulled Lu Qianxing over, asking him to identify it.\n\nLu Qianxing looked at the symbol on the statue's arm and identified it carefully. However, he eventually shook his head, \"I haven't seen it before, but I don't think it's a curse inscription. If it were a curse inscription, carving only half of it would be useless.\" The strange symbol on the statue's arm was only half complete, and if it were a curse inscription, having only half of it would be of no use. Therefore, Lu Qianxing believed that the strange symbol carved on the statue's arm was not a curse inscription but something else.\n\n\"Could it just be a tattoo?\" Chen Hui thought that the strange symbol on the statue's arm might just be a tattoo.\n\n\"The previous statues didn't have this strange symbol. If we go back now, will those statues also have the same symbols?\" Thinking of what Lin Xiao had said earlier about everything around them changing, Ye Bin guessed whether the statues in the previous malls might have changed after their departure.\n\n\"It's possible, but other changes might also occur,\" Lin Xiao's words were still very calm.\n\n\"Other changes? What changes?\" The group's attention immediately focused on Lin Xiao.\n\n\"The statues will disappear.\"\n\n(End of this chapter)",

They discovered that the strange statues located at the entrances of \"Taoti Bao\" (Playground) in three of the malls where statues had been were all gone, as if they had never existed.\n\n\"If I hadn't seen those statues before, I would really doubt if any statues ever existed here.\" Zhang Lan examined the entrance of \"Taoti Bao,\" finding no trace of any statues having been there.\n\n\"Did the little girl do it? But why? Do these statues have some kind of meaning?\" Chen Hui murmured, filled with questions.\n\n\"Only the statue in one mall remains. However, even that remaining statue is different from the ones that were there before. Firstly, its appearance has changed, and secondly, a new strange symbol has been found on its arm.\" When the group turned back to investigate the malls again, only the \"Taoti Bao\" entrance in one mall still had a statue. However, even this last statue had undergone subtle changes in its appearance, and a very peculiar symbol had also appeared on its arm.\n\n\"Detective Lin, I still have one question that I haven't understood. During the time we were investigating the various malls, I carefully observed the buildings outside, but I couldn't find anything special. I also didn't feel that sense of déjà vu you mentioned. I'm not sure what you meant by that sense of déjà vu, Detective Lin?\" While on the way to investigate the various malls, Ye Bin had very carefully observed the buildings around the intersection, but he had found nothing.\n\n\"Sequence.\" Lin Xiao said calmly, not directly answering Ye Bin's question but offering a hint.\n\n\"Sequence.\" Ye Bin murmured, then immediately ran out of the mall they were currently in. Following Lin Xiao's hint, Ye Bin observed the buildings around the intersection again. Finally, with Lin Xiao's guidance, Ye Bin understood what Lin Xiao meant by \"déjà vu.\"\n\n\"How is it, Binzi? Did you find anything?\" Zhang Lan followed Ye Bin out, also observing the surrounding buildings, but he couldn't find anything special. \"The buildings are arranged very haphazardly, at different heights, with no particular order.\" Zhang Lan thought that the sequence Lin Xiao mentioned might refer to the height of the buildings.\n\n\"Brother Lan, pay attention to the signs on each building. Following these signs, move outwards from the direction of the center of the intersection to see what you can find.\" Ye Bin pointed to the signs on the buildings around the intersection and gave Zhang Lan detailed instructions.\n\n\"Signs.\" Zhang Lan murmured, looking at the sign on the building closest to the center of the intersection.\n\nWith the intersection as the center, every building around it, from large shopping malls to small shops, had a rectangular plaque hanging on it, with a symbol carved on the plaque.\n\nZhang Lan observed all the plaques and the symbols on them. At first, he was completely clueless, but as he looked along from the center of the intersection, Zhang Lan gradually frowned.\n\n\"Brother Lan, do you understand?\"\n\n\"The signs on each building are a stroke. When these strokes are connected, they form a name.\" When Zhang Lan discovered that the signs on the buildings could be connected to form a name, he froze on the spot.\n\n\"Indeed, it really is a name!\" While Ye Bin and Zhang Lan were talking, everyone else had come out of the mall. Hearing Zhang Lan's discovery, Chen Hui also put together a name based on the strokes of the signs on the buildings.\n\n\"Dash, dash, vertical, dash, right-falling, horizontal, horizontal, hook, dash, dot. Dot, dot, rising, horizontal, vertical.\" Chen Hui gestured with his hand to write a person's name, but as he wrote the last part, Chen Hui suddenly froze. He then turned to Ye Bin beside him. \"Binzi, what was Uncle Xu's name?\"\n\n\"Xu Jiang.\" Ye Bin said coldly.\n\nWhen he heard the name \"Xu Jiang,\" Chen Hui froze on the spot. He then pointed to a building around the intersection and said with a trembling voice, \"Binzi, look at that building. You put together the next stroke. If I'm not mistaken, it should be the characters 'Xu Jiang'.\"\n\nHearing Chen Hui's words, Ye Bin was taken aback for a moment, then his gaze shifted. He looked at the building Chen Hui was pointing to and began to spell it out from front to back.\n\n\"Xu... Uncle Xu's name, what's going on!\" Just like Chen Hui's spelling, Ye Bin spelled out the name \"Xu Jiang.\"\n\n\"It really is Old Xu's name! What's going on!\" Zhang Lan also tried to spell it out and ultimately arrived at the same result as Chen Hui and Ye Bin, spelling out the two characters \"Xu Jiang.\"\n\n\"Dot, horizontal.\" Chen Hui tried spelling it out from another building after a break in the buildings, finally spelling out a new name.\n\n\"Liu Jiaxing!\" After Chen Hui spelled out the three characters \"Liu Jiaxing,\" he shivered.\n\n\"Sun Xitao.\" Zhang Lan beside him also began to spell, similarly spelling out a name he had seen before.\n\n\"And Old Wang's name. The names spelled out by these buildings are all people who died from the '18th Route' bus curse.\" Ye Bin also spelled out a familiar name. Based on the current findings, Ye Bin had made a simple judgment. Starting from the intersection, the names spelled out by the strokes on the buildings were likely people who had died from the \"18th Route\" bus curse.\n\n\"If I'm not mistaken, these buildings are markers the little girl used to mark the names of the people she killed?\" Lu Qianxing said with a somber expression, his heart filled with shock.\n\n\"Those who died from the curse were all passengers on the '18th Route' bus. Are the other names the names of other passengers on the bus?\" Ye Bin murmured, also making a judgment.\n\n\"We've been investigating for so long, and it turns out the killer is the little girl, and the little girl is already dead. So, the killer is a ghost?\" Chen Hui said, goosebumps rising all over him. After a shiver, he leaned closer to Ye Bin.\n\n\"The matter of the buildings is clear; they are the names of the deceased who died from the 'curse.' But what about the statues in the malls? What is their meaning?\" Ye Bin frowned, feeling a headache coming on.\n\nJust as Ye Bin was feeling overwhelmed, he suddenly thought of something, and his expression immediately darkened. He then looked at Zhang Lan beside him. \"Brother Lan, if our guess is correct, then doesn't that mean that Narrator... he...\" Thinking of this, Ye Bin lacked the courage to continue.\n\n\"Old Xu!\" Zhang Lan also realized something and felt his mind go blank.\n\n\"If our judgment is correct, then the person we saw in the bronze coffin earlier was probably Xu Jiang.\" Lin Xiao said calmly, reminding everyone.\n\n\"No... it can't be.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 180: Giving Up Is Harder Than Persevering\n\nNight swallowed the sky, turning the once-quiet crossroads into an even more desolate place.\n\n\"Binzi, what are you thinking about?\" Ye Bin and his companions found a bar on the street at the crossroads. Except for Lin Xiao and Lu Qianxing, Ye Bin and the other two were holding wine glasses, sitting at the bar and drinking.\n\n\"Lan Ge, we've been investigating this case for almost half a year, haven't we?\" Ye Bin's eyes were a little blurry, and he looked rather dispirited.\n\n\"Yeah, five months and change, to be exact,\" Zhang Lan said, picking up his wine glass from the bar and downing it in one gulp. \"Even though we know we're in an illusion, this illusion feels so real. Drinking a bit even makes me feel tipsy.\" Looking at the empty wine glass in his hand, a faint smile flickered across Zhang Lan's face.\n\n\"Binzi, are we still going to continue the investigation? We're trapped here and don't even know how to get out. Is there any point in continuing the investigation? Besides, from the very beginning, it seems only we cared about the truth and wanted to figure everything out.\" Chen Hui swirled the red wine in his glass, took a small sip, then turned to look at Ye Bin beside him.\n\nYe Bin didn't answer Chen Hui's words. Instead, he picked up a glass of wine in front of him and examined it carefully. After a long while, Ye Bin suddenly spoke slowly, \"Lan Ge, the wine here seems different from the outside! Compared to the outside, the wine here seems to have a special taste.\"\n\n\"What taste?\" Zhang Lan's gaze fell on Ye Bin, and a hint of confusion crossed his face.\n\n\"I can't quite describe the specific taste, but I just feel that after drinking the wine here, I feel a sense of inner comfort,\" Ye Bin said, taking a sip of the wine in his glass.\n\n\"Inner comfort?\" Hearing Ye Bin's words, Zhang Lan murmured, looking at the empty wine glass in his hand, lost in thought.\n\n\"Binzi, Lan Ge, if we make it back alive this time, let's leave X City together. I had a childhood dream of going to A City. They say A City is particularly prosperous, many times larger than X City.\" Chen Hui took another sip of wine, then put down his glass and sighed deeply, a look of hope on his face.\n\n\"That's a good idea. I've saved quite a bit of money over the years. Although it's not much, renting a place and opening a shop in A City shouldn't be too big a problem. If all else fails, we can go to the outskirts of A City; the cost of living there shouldn't be too high.\" Before Ye Bin could speak, Zhang Lan began to fantasize about their future life.\n\nYe Bin swirled his wine glass and drank the wine in it. After putting down the glass, Ye Bin's eyes stared blankly ahead, ignoring everything Zhang Lan and Chen Hui said.\n\n\"Chen Hui, Lan Ge, do you think Uncle Xu, he really...\" Ye Bin sighed and said slowly, but then fell silent.\n\n\"I don't know either. But so far, everyone whose name has appeared at the architectural institute, and whom we know, has already...\" Zhang Lan said, shaking his head slightly, a look of helplessness on his face.\n\n\"Uncle Xu always said that if he retired one day, he would open a restaurant. He said if he hadn't accidentally become a police officer, he would have become the most famous chef in X City.\" Ye Bin said, his eyes turning a little moist. He then picked up the wine bottle beside him and refilled his glass.\n\n\"Every time this happened, Uncle Zhao would come out to tease Uncle Xu. Uncle Zhao said Uncle Xu's cooking was terrible, and that it once gave him diarrhea for a week.\" Ye Bin said, sighed, picked up his wine glass, and drank it down again.\n\nAfter finishing the wine, two lines of tears slowly slid down Ye Bin's eyes, followed by his eyes turning red.\n\n\"Binzi,\" seeing Ye Bin's state, Zhang Lan gritted his teeth, wanting to say something but not knowing where to start.\n\n\"Uncle Xu always told us stories from his youth. He said when he was young, he was the campus heartthrob and many girls pursued him. And every time this happened, Uncle Zhao would come to tease him again. Uncle Zhao said Uncle Xu was the most annoying campus heartthrob in the class, and no girls liked him; it was just Uncle Xu being conceited.\" Ye Bin said, forcing a very strained smile onto his face. While smiling, Ye Bin picked up the wine bottle again and refilled his glass.\n\nJust as Ye Bin was about to continue drinking, Chen Hui suddenly reached out and stopped him. \"Binzi, you can't drink any more.\"\n\n\"Why not!\" Ye Bin looked at Chen Hui, his face full of drunkenness. Compared to his usual self, Ye Bin now felt very unfamiliar to Chen Hui.\n\n\"Binzi, I know you're upset, we all are. But at this moment, if even you fall, everything will be over.\" Chen Hui, who usually thought of giving up easily, became resolute at this moment upon seeing the dispirited Ye Bin.\n\n\"I'm not upset. There's nothing to be upset about. Everything, everything is over.\" Ye Bin said, tears continuing to slide down his cheeks.\n\n\"Binzi, we've persevered for so long. Are you going to give up at this point? And Lan Ge, aren't you usually the one advising Binzi? Why are you choosing to give up at this time!\" Seeing the dispirited Ye Bin and Zhang Lan, Chen Hui felt like he had lost something important.\n\n\"Kid, some things, when you know you can't do them, why bother doing them so hard? It's better to just give up decisively.\" Like Ye Bin, Zhang Lan also had a slight flush of drunkenness on his face.\n\n\"Haven't we already found out a lot? Isn't the truth about to be revealed?\" Chen Hui asked anxiously.\n\n\"The truth revealed? Chen Hui, didn't you just say yourself that no one cares about the so-called truth, and only we ourselves care about it? Since no one cares, why should we stubbornly persist?\" Ye Bin said, raising his glass again.\n\nHearing Ye Bin's answer, Chen Hui was stunned, a sense of confusion rising in his heart.\n\n\"Such good wine! Drink more, you might not have the chance again,\" Ye Bin said, hiccuped, and then drank the freshly filled wine in one gulp.\n\nAfter finishing another glass of wine, Ye Bin's face became extremely red, and he was completely in a drunken state.\n\nSeeing Ye Bin's state, Zhang Lan seemed to forget everything at that moment. He also finished a glass of wine with Ye Bin, then threw an arm around Ye Bin's shoulder and said with a drunken smile, \"Binzi, come on, let's have a good drink today!\"\n\nChen Hui looked at Ye Bin and Zhang Lan at this moment, feeling a profound sense of unfamiliarity. It was as if the two people before him were not the Ye Bin and Zhang Lan he knew.\n\n\"Binzi! Lan Ge!\"\n\n\"Come! Chen Hui! Drink! I'll toast you!\"\n\n\"Yeah! Come! Drink!\" Zhang Lan hiccuped, pointing at the wine glasses on the bar, signaling Chen Hui to drink.\n\nFacing the current state of the two, Chen Hui got up and left the bar. After leaving the bar, Chen Hui saw Lin Xiao and Lu Qianxing, who had been standing outside the bar all along.\n\n\"Brother Hui? Where's Brother Bin and Uncle Lan?\" Seeing only Chen Hui come out, Lu Qianxing asked with confusion.\n\nChen Hui lowered his head, sighed, and shook his head helplessly.\n\n\"Sometimes, giving up is harder than persevering. Give them some time,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, looking at Ye Bin and the other drinking inside through the bar's glass.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

At first, the two chatted and laughed, seemingly enjoying themselves. But slowly, their conversation dwindled. Eventually, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan were just mechanically drinking, neither of them speaking another word.\n\n\"In all the time I've known Binzi, I've never seen him like this. Uncle Xu's incident has hit him too hard,\" Chen Hui said, watching Ye Bin's dejected back through the window from outside the bar, feeling a sense of indescribable emotion.\n\n\"Even the strongest person has a soft spot in their heart. Once that softest spot is touched, no matter how strong they are, they will collapse for a moment,\" Lin Xiao murmured to himself, deeply understanding the predicament Ye Bin and Zhang Lan were currently in.\n\n\"Is there... is there no way?\" Chen Hui asked Lin Xiao with a worried expression, fearing that Ye Bin and Zhang Lan would be utterly demoralized by Old Xu's matter.\n\nLin Xiao didn't answer Chen Hui's question. In fact, Lin Xiao didn't know how to answer. Having experienced similar situations himself, Lin Xiao knew that at this time, the only one who could help was the one who had fallen.\n\n\"Uncle... Uncle...\" Just as Lin Xiao and the other two were focusing all their attention on Ye Bin and the other, suddenly, Lin Xiao and the other two heard a faint voice from behind them.\n\n\"Who!\" Lu Qianxing was the first to turn his head, followed closely by Lin Xiao. However, Chen Hui shivered at that moment and did not turn around immediately.\n\nAfter turning around, Lu Qianxing and Lin Xiao began scanning their surroundings, trying to locate the source of the sound.\n\nUsing the faint light from the surrounding streetlights, Lu Qianxing and Lin Xiao searched for a long time without finding anything unusual. The faint voice from before seemed to have vanished.\n\n\"Did we imagine it?\" Lin Xiao frowned slightly, looking at Lu Qianxing beside him.\n\n\"It shouldn't be. Just now, the moment that voice sounded, I felt like someone was watching us from behind.\" Although it was only for a moment, Lu Qianxing had truly felt a faint presence appear behind them the instant that faint voice sounded.\n\n\"Qianxing, could there still be ghosts in this illusion?\" Chen Hui leaned towards Lu Qianxing, his face filled with fear.\n\n\"Since it's an illusion, anything appearing is not out of the question,\" Lu Qianxing replied to Chen Hui's question while still scanning his surroundings, searching for the source of the sound.\n\nUpon hearing Lu Qianxing's answer, Chen Hui shivered instantly, and scenes from \"supernatural\" movies he had watched in the past began to flood his mind.\n\n\"Judging by the voice just now, it should be a little girl's voice. Could it be that little girl?\" Lin Xiao guessed, looking at Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"I think it's that little girl too, but the presence I felt behind us just now didn't have any resentment. If it's that little girl, she should have a lot of resentment,\" Lu Qianxing scratched his head, unable to explain what was happening.\n\n\"Regardless of whether it's that little girl or not, since the other party appeared once, I think they will appear a second time,\" Lin Xiao surmised. Since the other party appeared, they had a purpose, and if their purpose wasn't achieved after appearing once, then they would definitely appear a second time.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lu Qianxing nodded, agreeing with Lin Xiao's guess. He also felt that the other party wouldn't just appear to scare them, especially since they hadn't managed to scare them.\n\n\"Should we go in and notify Binzi and the others?\" Although Chen Hui was scared, he immediately thought of Ye Bin and the other inside the bar.\n\n\"Damn it!\" When Chen Hui mentioned Ye Bin and the other, Lu Qianxing's expression instantly turned grim. Then, all three of them turned around. Ye Bin and the other, who had been sitting at the bar drinking, had now disappeared.\n\n\"Is the other party's target Ye Bin and the other?\" Lin Xiao asked calmly, seeming unsurprised by the disappearance of Ye Bin and the other.\n\nAlthough Lin Xiao was calm, Chen Hui was completely flustered at this moment. \"Where are Binzi and Brother Lan? How did they disappear so suddenly! Could something have happened!\"\n\n\"Calm down. This is an illusion, they won't be in danger!\" Seeing Chen Hui become completely panicked, Lu Qianxing quickly tried to persuade him.\n\nWith Lu Qianxing's assurance, Chen Hui gradually calmed down, but the worry on his face did not diminish at all. \"Qianxing, what should we do now? Binzi and the other two are drunk. If they encounter something terrifying, then...\" Thinking of this, Chen Hui shivered all over.\n\nAlthough Lu Qianxing was reassuring Chen Hui that Ye Bin and the other would not be in danger, in reality, Lu Qianxing was as worried as Chen Hui, fearing that Ye Bin and the other might encounter danger, as this was his first time experiencing such a situation.\n\nCompared to Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing, Lin Xiao remained the calmest. Faced with the disappearance of Ye Bin and the other, Lin Xiao acted as if nothing had happened, his eyes constantly moving around, as if searching for something.\n\n\"Detective Lin, what are you looking for! Are you looking for Binzi and the others?\" Seeing Lin Xiao's gaze unceasing, Chen Hui anxiously asked him.\n\n\"I'm looking for changes in the surroundings. In the time between us turning to look for that voice and us turning back to see Ye Bin and the other disappear, one of the streetlights on that street went out,\" Lin Xiao said, pointing to the street south of the intersection. \"Nothing else has changed, so I suspect that to find Ye Bin and the others, we need to follow this street.\" In a very short time, Lin Xiao made the most accurate judgment.\n\n\"This street!\" Looking down the street Lin Xiao pointed to, Chen Hui could see nothing but the dim road illuminated by the faint light of the streetlights. This filled Chen Hui with intense fear, but thinking of Ye Bin and Zhang Lan, Chen Hui gritted his teeth and made a decision. \"Let's hurry! We have to find Binzi and the others!\"\n\nLu Qianxing, standing beside him, looked at the road Lin Xiao had pointed to. After a moment of hesitation, he ultimately chose to trust Lin Xiao's judgment and followed him to search the street south of the intersection.\n\nAt the same time, the drunken Ye Bin and the other suddenly realized that Chen Hui and the other three had disappeared. Upon realizing their disappearance, the two, who had been in a daze from drinking, instantly sobered up.\n\n\"Chen Hui and them? Did they leave first?\" After walking out of the bar, Ye Bin and the other couldn't find Chen Hui and the other three anywhere. Zhang Lan's heart was filled with confusion.\n\n\"No! Something must have happened!\" Ye Bin said with a grim face, coldly stating that he firmly believed Chen Hui and the others would not abandon them. Since the three had disappeared, it must be because something had happened.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 182: A Dream?\n\n\"We've been walking for so long, and still haven't reached the end. Does this illusion have no end?\" Following the dim lights, Chen Hui and the other two had been walking for nearly an hour, but they still hadn't reached the end of the street.\n\n\"It is indeed a bit strange. Generally speaking, illusions are created to trap people in a certain infinitely looping area, preventing them from leaving. However, as we walked along the street, the surrounding environment kept changing, so we shouldn't be trapped in an infinitely looping area.\" Lu Qianxing had been observing the surroundings as they walked. The buildings on both sides of the street had been constantly changing and not repeating.\n\n\"Qianxing, could it be that we're not trapped in a predicament, but just stuck somewhere?\" Chen Hui first spoke his suspicion, but then shook his head and dismissed his own idea. \"No, how could such a prosperous street be completely empty?\"\n\n\"This is an illusion, and there shouldn't be any problem. But the issue is, this illusion is indeed a bit strange. Why would the other party create such a huge illusion? Moreover, everything around us is so real. Creating such a large and realistic illusion is probably not a simple matter.\" Even Lu Qianxing was completely baffled by the current situation and had no idea what was going on.\n\nWhile Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing were talking, Lin Xiao had not intervened in their conversation. It was only when Lu Qianxing mentioned \"such a large and realistic illusion\" that Lin Xiao's brow furrowed slightly, and he thought of something.\n\n\"Qianxing, in Taoist arts, are there any sorceries that can cause people to fall into a dream?\" Lin Xiao suddenly spoke, asking Lu Qianxing beside him.\n\nUpon hearing Lin Xiao's question, Lu Qianxing was stunned. \"Sorcery to fall into a dream?\" Lu Qianxing murmured, clearly having never heard of the sorcery Lin Xiao mentioned.\n\n\"Yes! Like the 'Dream Architect' mentioned in a movie.\"\n\n\"Dream Architect? Never heard of it.\" Lu Qianxing shook his head. He had not heard of the \"Dream Architect\" Lin Xiao mentioned.\n\n\"Detective Lin! I've heard of it. Are you talking about that movie called 'Inception'?\" Although Lu Qianxing hadn't heard of or seen the movie Lin Xiao mentioned, Chen Hui immediately remembered it.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Lin Xiao nodded and began to explain to Lu Qianxing. \"The so-called 'Dream Architect' is someone who can shape dreams. I was wondering if there are any sorceries in Taoist arts similar to a 'Dream Architect' that can create dreams.\"\n\n\"Create dreams? You mean, we're not trapped in an illusion right now, but in a dream?\" After listening to Lin Xiao's explanation, Lu Qianxing understood Lin Xiao's current thought.\n\nLin Xiao nodded. \"According to what you said, creating such a real and huge illusion is not an easy task. However, if it were a dream, then it would be another matter entirely.\"\n\n\"Indeed, if it's a dream, then no matter how real or how big the dream is, it can appear!\" Chen Hui directly agreed with Lin Xiao's idea.\n\n\"Sorcery to make people fall into a dream.\" Lu Qianxing murmured. He thought for a long time, but couldn't recall any sorceries he knew of that could cause people to fall into a dream. \"I'm not sure if such sorcery exists, but I've certainly never heard of it. Moreover, I have another question: if this is a dream, how could the five of us appear in the same dream?\"\n\n\"Qianxing, it seems you haven't seen that movie. If you had seen it, you'd understand more or less,\" Chen Hui said, gently patting Lu Qianxing's shoulder.\n\n\"I just feel it's not very realistic,\" Lu Qianxing said, scratching his head with an awkward smile.\n\n\"Saying something isn't realistic coming from you feels a bit strange,\" Chen Hui said with a wry smile. He felt that the most unrealistic thing happening right now was meeting Lu Qianxing. After meeting Lu Qianxing, his world had never been realistic.\n\n\"The dream is just my guess. I can't prove yet whether we're trapped in an illusion or a dream,\" Lin Xiao said calmly. He hadn't found any basis for his guess yet.\n\n\"Even if it's a dream, it's not much different from an illusion. Whether we're trapped in an illusion or a dream, we can't leave,\" Chen Hui said with some emotion. Facing the current situation, he couldn't think of any way out.\n\n\"If it's an illusion, we have no way. But if it's a dream, perhaps there's a way,\" Lin Xiao's words made both Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing stunned.\n\n\"A way? What way?\"\n\n\"If it's a dream, as long as we wake up, the dream will be broken.\"\n\n\"Is it the same method as in the movie? Indeed, thinking about it that way, it's a good idea,\" Chen Hui said, nodding as he spoke.\n\n\"No, Qianxing said before that our consciousness might have some commonality with our bodies. If we use the method from the movie, it might cause problems with our consciousness, turning us into vegetative people.\" Lin Xiao had always remembered what Lu Qianxing had said earlier.\n\n\"Although I don't know what the method from the movie you're talking about is, I can roughly guess. If it's to break free from this situation by harming the body, it's too risky. If it affects our consciousness even slightly, we might never wake up.\" Lu Qianxing completely dismissed Chen Hui's idea.\n\n\"Then what other way is there?\" After his idea was completely dismissed, Chen Hui couldn't think of any other method.\n\n\"If it's truly just a dream, then everything in front of us is a false image constructed by someone, and we are trapped in the world of the person who constructed the dream. Since the other party constructed such a dream, it means that the person who constructed the dream is also in this dream. As long as we find that person, we can find a way to wake up.\" Lin Xiao explained his method to Chen Hui and the other person in detail.\n\n\"That's true, but Detective Lin, since this is a dream constructed by the other party, if they hide, we won't be able to find the person who constructed the dream, right?\" Chen Hui felt that finding the other party within their own dream was an impossible task.\n\n\"I have a method that might be able to find the person who constructed the dream, but I'm not sure if this method is effective,\" Lin Xiao said calmly. In fact, he had already thought of a way to lure out the person who constructed the dream.\n\n\"Whether it's effective or not, we'll only know by trying,\" Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing both showed a hint of excitement. They were very much looking forward to the method Lin Xiao mentioned.\n\n\"The method to make the other party appear is very simple: just destroy the dream they constructed.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 183 The Virtual World",
    "content": "Chapter 183: A Fictional World\n\n\"Destroy the dream?\" Upon hearing Lin Xiao's proposed method, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing both wore expressions of confusion. Neither of them fully understood Lin Xiao's suggestion.\n\n\"From the very beginning, everything around us has been constantly changing, and the changes haven't stopped during the time we've been walking, so I suspect the person who constructed this dream is secretly observing us. If that's the case, perhaps by doing something that disrupts the dream they constructed, we can force them to reveal themselves,\" Lin Xiao explained his thoughts in detail to Chen Hui and the other.\n\n\"Destroying the dream they constructed to force them to reveal themselves? But I have another question. Why is Detective Lin so sure that destroying the dream they constructed will force them to reveal themselves?\" Chen Hui felt that even if their group destroyed the dream, it wouldn't necessarily force the creator to appear. After all, it was just a dream. Even if they destroyed it, the creator could simply reconstruct it.\n\nLu Qianxing, after listening to Chen Hui's question, nodded in agreement. His thoughts were the same as Chen Hui's; he didn't believe the creator would appear just because the dream was damaged.\n\n\"Your thoughts aren't wrong, but you've overlooked a crucial point,\" Lin Xiao stated calmly, unfazed by Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing's doubts.\n\n\"What point?\" Both Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing looked bewildered. They couldn't think of any important point that Lin Xiao might be referring to.\n\n\"Firstly, the dream is very important to the person who constructed it. This can be discerned from the details in every aspect of the dream. If they simply wanted to trap us, there would be no need for such detailed construction,\" Lin Xiao explained.\n\n\"Details?\" Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing frowned, falling into thought at Lin Xiao's explanation.\n\nAfter a long pause, they both nodded in agreement with Lin Xiao's words. They recalled their previous investigation of some of the shopping malls around the crossroads. The interiors of each mall were almost identical to their real-life counterparts, and some even had more complete facilities than the real ones.\n\n\"Secondly, during our previous investigations, I destroyed a ball pit in one of the shopping malls, damaging most of the facilities inside. However, when we investigated that mall for the second time, the ball pit showed no signs of damage. Although the facilities in the ball pit were repaired, I discovered that the creator seemed to have made every effort to restore the ball pit to its pre-damaged state. However, the repaired ball pit had some obvious discrepancies compared to how it was before I damaged it. From this, I surmise that once something in the dream is destroyed, the creator cannot restore it to its original state.\"\n\nListening to Lin Xiao's words, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing looked at him with admiration. They had never expected that Lin Xiao had done so much beforehand to verify his current judgment.\n\n\"There's a third point, and it's the most critical one. Haven't you noticed that everything in this dream seems so orderly, like a real city? From this, I deduce that this dream was constructed from the very beginning, and it wasn't initially intended to trap us. It's more like the creator was building their own world, and we just happened to appear in the world they created.\"\n\nAfter elaborating on the three reasons, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing began to feel that this dream was something the creator had poured countless efforts into. If the dream were to be damaged, the creator would surely appear to stop them.\n\n\"The point Detective Lin is making is the importance of this dream to its creator, isn't it? Indeed, if your deductions are correct, destroying the dream will force them to appear and stop us. However, I have a new concern. If we damage the dream they constructed, will it enrage them? It might plunge us into even greater danger,\" Chen Hui felt that using Lin Xiao's method to force the creator to appear might be counterproductive and lead them into greater peril.\n\n\"If there were truly danger, Detective Lin would have encountered it when he destroyed the dream before. The reason Detective Lin is safe now, I believe, might be for other reasons,\" Lu Qianxing, from the side, analyzed the new concern raised by Chen Hui.\n\n\"The reason you're suggesting, I think, we'll understand once we meet the creator of this dream,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, possessing absolute confidence in his proposed method.\n\nSensing Lin Xiao's confidence and recalling their interactions during their time together, Chen Hui no longer hesitated and chose to trust Lin Xiao. After all, he didn't believe Lin Xiao would take risks without any preparation or certainty.\n\n\"Detective Lin, we'll listen to you. What should we do now to force them to appear? If we only cause damage of the extent you did before, it probably won't be enough to make them reveal themselves,\" Chen Hui, having chosen to believe Lin Xiao, began to ponder what level of destruction would be necessary to elicit a response.\n\n\"Although it's just a simple inference, I believe that if we destroy the ball pit in the shopping mall, it will cause the creator to appear.\"\n\n\"Just destroy the ball pit?\" Hearing Lin Xiao's deduction, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing both frowned. They once again found Lin Xiao's idea difficult to comprehend.\n\n\"Yes, the explanation will come when the creator appears, and we'll have our answer.\"\n\n\"Detective Lin doesn't think that the ball pit in the shopping mall is very important to that little girl, does he? You know, up to this point, that little girl has killed so many people,\" Chen Hui felt that if the creator of the dream was the little girl, how could a murderous \"demon\" care about a \"ball pit\" that only children liked?\n\n\"Brother Hui, if I were that little girl, the most important thing in this dream to me would be the ball pit,\" Lin Xiao did not answer Chen Hui's question directly. Instead, Lu Qianxing spoke up, providing the answer.\n\n\"Why? Could it be? Just because they are a little girl? You know, within that little girl's heart, there hides a murderous 'demon'!\" Chen Hui could not agree with Lu Qianxing's idea.\n\n\"I once heard about a case. A major drug lord, a murderous criminal, simply because a roller coaster in an amusement park was dismantled, he personally risked his life and killed dozens of workers who dismantled the roller coaster. In the end, when the drug lord was brought to justice, the police asked him why he killed. His answer was very simple.\"\n\n\"'The roller coaster was my childhood dream. I will not allow anyone to dismantle it.'\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 184: The Little Girl in the Painting\n\nFlowers bloom with two sides, people exist between Buddha and demon. Everything in the world originally has two sides, one good and one evil.\n\nThe moment a person reveals their good side, people will think they are a good person. The moment they reveal their evil side, they become a bad person.\n\nThe evaluation of good and evil depends entirely on how the world perceives them. However, in reality, sometimes the world does not know that the so-called \"good people\" hide the most terrifying evil in their hearts, while those \"bad people\" who are scorned by the world sometimes retain the most genuine goodness.\n\nThere is a story about a disaster that struck a village, leaving only three people: a \"good person,\" a \"bad person,\" and a little girl. In the face of life and death, the \"good person\" let go of the little girl's hand and fled alone, while the \"bad person\" took the little girl's hand, along with what he called his \"burden,\" and they left together.\n\n\"Detective Lin, we've already destroyed three play areas, and the other party still hasn't shown up. Could we be overthinking this?\" Chen Hui and his group had successively destroyed three play areas in shopping malls, but nothing had happened at all.\n\n\"I just inspected the play areas we destroyed earlier, and they haven't been repaired.\" After destroying the third \"play area,\" Lu Qianxing, under Lin Xiao's instructions, went to inspect the first \"play area\" that had been damaged by everyone. However, contrary to Lin Xiao's guess, the damaged \"play area\" had not been repaired.\n\nLin Xiao looked at the play area destroyed by the three of them. He didn't speak, but calmly gazed forward, his face expressionless.\n\n\"Detective Lin, what should we do now? Should we continue?\" Chen Hui felt that since they had continuously destroyed three play areas without any response, continuing to destroy them would just be a waste of time.\n\nLin Xiao did not reply, his gaze still fixed on the play area ahead, his mind deep in thought.\n\n\"Although the play areas we destroyed earlier haven't been repaired, I found this at the scene.\" Just as Lin Xiao was deep in thought, Lu Qianxing produced a thin picture book and handed it to Lin Xiao.\n\nLin Xiao came back to his senses from his thoughts. He then took the small picture book handed to him by Lu Qianxing. After opening it, Lin Xiao saw several drawings in the thin booklet.\n\n\"Are these drawings by a child?\" Chen Hui peeked, looking at the drawings in the picture book, and immediately determined that they were likely drawn by a child.\n\n\"Probably.\" Lu Qianxing nodded. He and Chen Hui shared the same thought. The drawings in the booklet were clearly the work of a child.\n\nLin Xiao ignored the conversation between Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing, slowly flipping through the booklet, carefully examining each drawing.\n\n\"They just look like casual drawings by a child.\" Chen Hui, like Lin Xiao, was looking at the drawings in the picture book, but Chen Hui didn't find anything special. He just thought they were casual drawings by a child.\n\n\"Where was this found in the play area?\" After inspecting the drawings, Lin Xiao turned and asked Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"At the entrance.\"\n\n\"The entrance?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Lu Qianxing nodded. \"As soon as I entered the mall and reached the play area on the third floor, I saw this picture book just lying on the ground.\" Lu Qianxing recalled.\n\n\"So, it appeared after we destroyed the play area and left?\" Before Lin Xiao could speak, Chen Hui frowned, a hint of confusion on his face.\n\n\"Did you find anything else, or were there any changes around the play area?\" Lin Xiao asked Lu Qianxing again.\n\nLu Qianxing slowly shook his head. \"No. After finding this picture book, I inspected the play area we had damaged, but I found nothing else. As for other areas of the mall, I didn't inspect them closely.\"\n\nAfter listening to Lu Qianxing's answer, Lin Xiao nodded thoughtfully and finally made a decision, \"Let's go back and inspect the previous mall. I want to confirm something.\"\n\n\"Confirm something?\" Hearing Lin Xiao's words, a look of confusion flashed across Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing's faces. However, before they could ask, Lin Xiao had already set off and left the mall they were currently in.\n\nUpon returning to the mall where the picture book was found, Lin Xiao first conducted a thorough investigation of the play area that he and his group had damaged. Then, after finishing the investigation of the play area, Lin Xiao turned and investigated the entire mall himself.\n\nAfter nearly an hour of investigating all four floors of the mall, Lin Xiao returned to the entrance of the play area that his group had damaged, his expression grave.\n\n\"Detective Lin? How is it? Did you find anything?\" While Lin Xiao was investigating, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing had begun to have questions. However, because Lin Xiao was investigating so seriously, they did not interrupt him. Only after Lin Xiao finished his investigation did they hurriedly step forward to ask him.\n\nLin Xiao, with a grim expression, handed the picture book in his hand to Chen Hui and the other. \"Open the third drawing,\" Lin Xiao said coldly. Then, Chen Hui took the picture book and opened the third drawing in it.\n\nThe third drawing in the picture book was very abstract. At first glance, it seemed like a child had randomly scribbled with a brush. However, upon closer observation, a child's figure could faintly be seen within the abstract picture.\n\n\"I don't have artistic talent. At first, I really didn't notice there was a child in the drawing.\" With Lin Xiao's prompting, Chen Hui saw that there was indeed a child in the third drawing.\n\n\"A child? How come I don't see it!\" Lu Qianxing tilted his head, observing the third drawing in the picture book from all directions, but he never saw a child in the third drawing.\n\n\"Here! Look!\" Following the outline of the child in the drawing, Chen Hui gestured to Lu Qianxing. However, Lu Qianxing frowned, looking confused, as if he still couldn't see the child in the drawing.\n\n\"No! Look in the direction I'm drawing!\" Chen Hui showed a helpless smile on his face. He had already gestured very clearly, but Lu Qianxing still couldn't understand.\n\nJust as Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing were looking at each other with helplessness, Lin Xiao suddenly spoke, \"Qianxing, are you colorblind?\"\n\n\"Colorblind? Uh, I don't know, probably not. But sometimes, I do have trouble distinguishing a few colors.\"\n\n\"Oh! No wonder. If you're colorblind, it's normal not to see it!\" Hearing Lin Xiao's question, Chen Hui suddenly realized.\n\n\"A bit awkward, huh!\" Lu Qianxing scratched his head and gave an awkward laugh.\n\n\"Wait a minute, if this isn't just random scribbling, then!\" Chen Hui held the picture book, suddenly thinking of something, and flipped the page. Then, on the fourth page, in a similarly abstract drawing, Chen Hui also saw a child. However, when he saw the child in the fourth drawing, Chen Hui shivered instantly.\n\nIn the fourth drawing, there was a little girl with her hair tied in a ponytail, holding a teddy bear in her left hand and a long, thin dagger tightly in her right hand.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 185: Fate\n\n\"We've searched everywhere around and still can't find Chen Hui and the others. Where could they have gone at a time like this?\" Ye Bin and Zhang Lan, who had discovered Chen Hui's group had vanished, searched the area around the intersection but found no trace of Chen Hui and his companions.\n\nYe Bin's face was grim, and he felt immense self-blame. If he hadn't fallen into despair, the current situation would clearly not have happened. \"It's all my fault! I shouldn't have been drinking my sorrows away at a time like this!\" Ye Bin clenched his fists and spoke through gritted teeth.\n\n\"Binzi, don't blame yourself. This is my fault. At my age, I only know how to evade. I should have stepped up at a time like this,\" Zhang Lan said, shaking his head and sighing helplessly. \"However, this is not the time for us to blame ourselves. We must find a way to locate Chen Hui and the others, otherwise...\" As he spoke, a scene of Old Xu lying in the bronze coffin flashed through Zhang Lan's mind.\n\nHearing Zhang Lan's persuasion, Ye Bin nodded in agreement. He understood that blaming himself at this moment was useless.\n\n\"Chen Hui has Qian Xing and Detective Lin with him, so they should be fine. Moreover, I don't think they would abandon us and leave. Something must have happened that caused us to be separated,\" Ye Bin said, calming down as he began to observe his surroundings. While observing, Ye Bin also paid attention to the surrounding buildings. He breathed a sigh of relief when he found no names of Chen Hui's group on them.\n\n\"Although I don't know where Chen Hui and the others are now, I believe they will try to find us once they realize we've been separated. Since that's the case, Lan Ge, let's not move around too much. Let's try to stay here and wait for Chen Hui and the others.\" Ye Bin felt that with Lu Qian Xing and Lin Xiao by Chen Hui's side, they were safer than their own group. Therefore, it would be more suitable for Chen Hui's group to find them rather than the other way around.\n\n\"Okay.\" Zhang Lan agreed with Ye Bin's suggestion. He also knew that at this moment, compared to Chen Hui's group, they themselves were in greater danger.\n\n\"Speaking of which, Binzi, when we were looking for Chen Hui and the others earlier, did you notice that there was a strange feeling in one of the malls? I always felt like someone was watching us.\" Just now, while Zhang Lan and Ye Bin were searching the area for Chen Hui and the others, they investigated a mall. Inside, Zhang Lan always felt like a pair of eyes were staring at his back, but when he turned around, he couldn't see anyone.\n\nHearing Zhang Lan's words, Ye Bin frowned slightly. In fact, he had the same feeling as Zhang Lan, but at the time he was anxious to find Chen Hui and the others and didn't pay much attention to it. \"For a moment, I did feel a pair of eyes watching me from behind, but I was thinking about finding Chen Hui and the others and didn't pay much attention.\"\n\n\"Should we go back to that mall to investigate? Chen Hui and the others might have disappeared from there,\" Zhang Lan suggested, but then he shook his head and dismissed the idea. \"Forget it. It's better to be careful at a time like this. After all, we don't have Qian Xing with us. If we encounter anything terrifying and get into danger, it will be troublesome.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Ye Bin first nodded, then looked up at the dark sky. \"Lan Ge, haven't you noticed that this night seems to be a bit long?\" In Ye Bin's memory, a long time had passed since he and Zhang Lan were drinking, and finding Chen Hui and the others had taken at least two hours. However, during this time, the sky hadn't changed at all; it remained pitch black, as if dawn would never come.\n\n\"I did notice it, but if this is an illusion, then problems with time aren't really an issue,\" Zhang Lan felt that since they were deep within an illusion, it was normal for it to remain dark all the time.\n\n\"Perhaps.\" Ye Bin didn't deny Zhang Lan's explanation, as, just as Zhang Lan said, they were trapped in an illusion, and anything was possible in an illusion.\n\nYe Bin and Zhang Lan stood in front of the bar, their gazes involuntarily scanning their surroundings, trying to find some clues.\n\n\"The surrounding environment doesn't seem to have changed.\" Although Ye Bin was drunk earlier, his consciousness was still clear, and he had a clear memory of the surrounding environment.\n\n\"The statues at the entrance of the ball pit in the mall are all gone. Do you think those mysterious statues might be related to the disappearance of Chen Hui and the others?\" When Ye Bin and Zhang Lan were searching for Chen Hui and the others earlier, they had also investigated the malls where Chen Hui and the others had investigated before. In those malls, all the statues at the entrance of the ball pits had disappeared, as if they had never existed.\n\n\"There was clearly a statue there before, and now that Chen Hui and the others have disappeared, that statue has also disappeared. I think this coincidence is more than just a coincidence,\" Ye Bin muttered, answering Zhang Lan's question as he analyzed.\n\n\"We still haven't figured out what those mysterious symbols on the statues were all about. So far, it's just one mystery after another. I feel like I'm becoming a mystery myself,\" Zhang Lan sighed helplessly. Facing the series of events that had recently occurred, he was left with nothing but mysteries in his heart.\n\nYe Bin also sighed helplessly. Facing the current situation, Ye Bin had begun to doubt whether he had the ability to solve this case.\n\n\"Binzi, you've never talked about yourself. I only know about your younger brother, Ye He. Speaking of which, why did you become a police officer?\" Zhang Lan and Ye Bin had known each other for not a long time, but not a short time either. However, during the time they had known each other, Zhang Lan had never heard Ye Bin mention anything about himself. Even about Ye He, Zhang Lan only found out incidentally that Ye Bin had a younger brother.\n\n\"Why did I become a police officer?\" Ye Bin murmured, and then his gaze became somewhat distant. After a long while, Ye Bin slowly spoke. \"I can't remember anymore. Perhaps... it was fate.\"\n\n\"The word 'fate,' coming from your mouth, always feels a bit strange,\" Zhang Lan said with a smile. Hearing Ye Bin mention the word \"fate,\" he felt a bit awkward.\n\n\"What? Lan Ge, you don't believe in fate?\" Ye Bin smiled slightly and turned to look at Zhang Lan beside him.\n\n\"I believe in it! But, I think fate, it depends on the timing. Sometimes, you can believe in it, but sometimes, you can't,\" Zhang Lan replied.\n\n\"Timing?\" Ye Bin's face showed a hint of confusion. He couldn't understand Zhang Lan's words.\n\n\"Simply put, sometimes you can believe in it, and sometimes it's better not to. Haha, does that sound strange?\" Zhang Lan said, showing a slightly awkward smile.\n\n\"Lan Ge's meaning is that fate is determined by ourselves?\" Ye Bin analyzed based on Zhang Lan's words.\n\n\"Yes, you could put it that way. Fate itself is hard to understand.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "title": "Chapter 186 Painting Book",
    "content": "Chapter 186: The Picture Book\n\n“This little girl is really creepy to look at!” When Chen Hui saw the little girl on the fourth page of the picture book, he shivered. Cold sweat even broke out on his forehead.\n\n“Little girl? Where’s the little girl?” Due to his color blindness, Lu Qianxing couldn’t clearly see the content of the fourth drawing.\n\n“She’s right here! The little girl is holding a knife in her hand!” Chen Hui said, sketching the outline of the little girl in the drawing with his hand. However, to the color-blind Lu Qianxing, it just looked like a mess of pigments.\n\n“The other drawings don’t have anything special,” Chen Hui continued flipping through the picture book, not finding any new clues in the other pictures.\n\nAlthough Chen Hui didn’t find any new clues, when Lin Xiao got the picture book back and continued flipping through it, he found another new clue in the last drawing.\n\nThe last drawing in the picture book depicted a house. In front of the house was a winding river. Beside the river, a little girl with a ponytail was drawn, smiling. She was holding a black wooden box, her gaze fixed straight ahead, as if smiling at someone.\n\n“Besides the wooden box in the little girl’s arms, there’s nothing special, right?” Chen Hui noticed that Lin Xiao seemed particularly interested in the last drawing. However, after his own repeated observation, apart from the wooden box in the little girl’s arms appearing somewhat special, Chen Hui found nothing else out of the ordinary.\n\nLin Xiao did not respond to Chen Hui’s words. Instead, he flipped through the picture book again, turning to the sixth drawing.\n\nThe sixth drawing in the picture book only depicted a river and a tree. Everything else was completely filled with red pigment.\n\n“This drawing feels a bit oppressive!” At first, Chen Hui didn’t feel an oppressive sensation from the sixth drawing. He just thought it was possibly a child messing around and using the wrong pigment. But now, as he looked at the sixth drawing again, for some reason, Chen Hui suddenly felt a sense of suffocation.\n\n“I understand this drawing. It’s just a river and a tree. But why is everything else, except for the river and the tree, filled with red pigment?” Lu Qianxing could finally clearly see the content of a drawing. However, when he saw the content, he felt confused.\n\n“Chen Hui, look closely. Do you see anything else beneath the red pigment?” Lin Xiao handed the picture book to Chen Hui.\n\nChen Hui took the picture book doubtfully and began to observe it very carefully. “It seems so. There’s a lighter-colored pigment under the red pigment that is being covered.” Under the red pigment, Chen Hui vaguely saw what seemed to be a lighter-colored pigment underneath.\n\n“Identify it carefully. What is the lighter-colored pigment depicting?” Lin Xiao said calmly.\n\n“It’s drawing…” Chen Hui narrowed his eyes and identified it carefully. “It looks like a person. No, it should be a head!” After careful identification, Chen Hui froze. Under the red pigment, Chen Hui saw a head drawn with a lighter-colored pigment.\n\n“A head!” Hearing Chen Hui’s words, Lu Qianxing was stunned. He then tilted his head and tried to identify it according to Lin Xiao’s hint, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t see anything other than the red pigment.\n\nFinally, Lu Qianxing rubbed his eyes and gave up. “Ah, I can’t see anything!”\n\n“Detective Lin, if we’re not mistaken, is that indeed a head under the red pigment?” Chen Hui looked at Lin Xiao, seeking an answer.\n\n“Turn to the seventh drawing,” Lin Xiao did not answer but told Chen Hui to turn to the next page.\n\nChen Hui quickly flipped through the picture book.\n\nThe seventh drawing in the picture book depicted a couple. The couple had smiles on their faces, and their gazes were fixed straight ahead, as if they were smiling at someone.\n\n“Detective Lin, are these two smiling at the little girl in front?” Chen Hui suddenly thought of something and then flipped through the picture book, turning to the last drawing.\n\nThe little girl in the last drawing seemed to be smiling at someone, and the couple in the seventh drawing also seemed to be smiling at someone. Therefore, Chen Hui made a judgment: the couple in the seventh drawing were smiling at the little girl in the last drawing.\n\nLin Xiao still didn’t give any answer to Chen Hui’s question. Instead, he indicated for Chen Hui to turn to the second to last drawing.\n\nIn the second to last drawing of the picture book, a family of three was depicted. However, it wasn’t the front of the family of three, but only their backs. In the drawing, the family of three seemed to be heading towards a certain place.\n\n“The drawings in this picture book are like telling a story!” A thought suddenly occurred to Chen Hui. Each drawing in the picture book seemed to be narrating a story.\n\n“Although I can only see some of the drawings clearly, and at first I thought these were indeed drawn by a child, after listening to you all, I feel like these drawings are not drawn by a child,” Lu Qianxing also made his own analysis. He felt that if a child had drawn them, how could there be so many hidden things?\n\n“I feel the same way,” Chen Hui nodded in agreement and then turned his gaze to Lin Xiao beside him. “What’s Detective Lin’s opinion?” Lin Xiao had not expressed his judgment all along, so Chen Hui was very curious about what Lin Xiao’s judgment was.\n\n“Have you noticed that some of these drawings do not seem to be from the same hand?” Lin Xiao said calmly, which made Chen Hui and the other person freeze.\n\n“Not from the same hand?” Hearing Lin Xiao’s words, Chen Hui flipped through the picture book and examined each drawing one by one. After finishing the examination, Chen Hui frowned. Based on what he saw, he couldn’t tell whether they were from the same person.\n\n“Detective Lin, I can’t tell,” Chen Hui helplessly spread his hands, unable to make a judgment, and then looked at Lin Xiao doubtfully.\n\n“The fourth drawing, the sixth drawing, and the second to last drawing. These three drawings, and the rest of the drawings, are not from the same hand. A simple judgment is based on the pigments in the picture book.”\n\n“Pigments?” Chen Hui heard this and immediately began to identify. Then, as he compared the drawings mentioned by Lin Xiao with the others, Chen Hui’s expression darkened, clearly having discovered something.\n\n“Brother Hui? What’s wrong? Did you find something?” Seeing Chen Hui’s suddenly darkened expression, Lu Qianxing immediately asked anxiously.\n\n“The three drawings mentioned by Detective Lin, the pigments on the left side of these three drawings are a bit light, while the pigments on the right side of the other drawings are a bit light. Based on this, we can make a judgment: the three drawings mentioned by Detective Lin were drawn with the left hand, while the rest were drawn with the right hand. The reason is that when a person draws with their left hand, the left hand will press down on the paper, causing the left side pigments to come into contact and rub with the left hand, diluting some of the pigments. The same applies to the right hand,” Chen Hui said, gesturing with his hands.\n\n“Indeed!” After listening to Chen Hui’s explanation, Lu Qianxing also took the picture book and examined the pigments on each drawing one by one, ultimately confirming Chen Hui’s judgment.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "**Chapter 187: The Bus at the Intersection**\n\n“Hey, why do you think there’s a distinction between good people and bad people in this world? We’re all people, one head, two arms, two legs. No one has anything more than anyone else.”\n\n“Just because we look similar doesn’t mean our thoughts are similar.”\n\n“Thoughts? Ah, you always overcomplicate things. For me, people are simple. Just follow your heart, move in the direction you want to go, why bother with all that messy stuff?”\n\n“If all you think about is yourself when you’re alive, wouldn’t the world be in chaos?”\n\n“Heh, as if it isn’t chaotic now. Good people, bad people, it’s just how people judge each other, really. There are countless bad people in this world. How many can be called good people? Hasn’t everyone done a few things against their conscience? Speaking of which, Binzi, have you ever done anything against your conscience?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You answered so readily. But the more readily you answer, the more I suspect that answer is against your conscience.”\n\n“Binzi! Binzi!” In a daze, Ye Bin heard a familiar voice. When he opened his eyes, he found Zhang Lan looking at him with concern.\n\n“Lan Ge.” Ye Bin felt a bit dizzy. When he came to his senses, he realized he was lying on a sofa in the bar. “Was I asleep?” Ye Bin scratched his head, his memory feeling a bit hazy.\n\n“Of course! You just fell asleep. I called you for ages and you didn’t respond. It was really worrying.” Seeing Ye Bin wake up, Zhang Lan let out a sigh of relief.\n\nHearing Zhang Lan’s words, Ye Bin frowned, then asked with confusion, “Weren’t we in an illusion? Can you fall asleep in an illusion? Or perhaps, we aren’t in an illusion?” As Ye Bin spoke, he began to doubt whether he had truly fallen into an illusion.\n\n“Now isn’t the time to dwell on why you could sleep. There’s something unusual outside. Get up quickly, let’s go take a look.” As Zhang Lan spoke, he pulled Ye Bin up.\n\n“Unusual?” Hearing Zhang Lan’s words, a hint of confusion flashed across Ye Bin’s face. He then followed Zhang Lan to the bar’s main door. Through the glass door of the bar, the two of them squatted on one side, looking out of the bar.\n\n“Look over there at the intersection, where the headlights are on.”\n\nFollowing Zhang Lan’s pointed direction, Ye Bin’s gaze instantly sharpened. “Is that a bus?” Although the headlights were dazzling, making it impossible for Ye Bin to clearly see the vehicle behind them, judging by the height of the headlights, the vehicle behind them should be a bus.\n\n“Yeah, it should be a bus. The vehicle appeared ten minutes ago and has been parked at the intersection, not moving.” Originally, after seeing Ye Bin asleep, Zhang Lan hadn’t intended to wake him, wanting him to rest. But just before, when he saw the headlights at the intersection, Zhang Lan had woken Ye Bin immediately.\n\n“Is it the ‘Route 18’ bus?”\n\n“Can’t tell yet. The headlights are too bright, can’t see the body of the bus.” Zhang Lan’s gaze was fixed on the dazzling light of the headlights as he looked towards the bus body, but besides a bright light, he couldn’t see the bus body at all.\n\n“Should we get closer to observe?”\n\n“No! It’s too dangerous! Without Qian Xing here, if something dangerous happens, it’ll be troublesome.” Hearing Ye Bin’s suggestion, Zhang Lan directly rejected it. More than investigating, he was worried about their safety.\n\n“But if we don’t get closer, we won’t discover anything.”\n\n“Wait! As long as that vehicle moves, we’ll be able to clearly see the body of the bus.” Zhang Lan’s intention was very clear: don’t act rashly, definitely don’t take risks.\n\nThus, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan squatted by the side of the bar’s glass door, their gazes never leaving the bus at the intersection.\n\nTen minutes, twenty minutes… Soon, nearly an hour passed, but the bus at the intersection showed no intention of moving.\n\n“Could they have discovered us?” After an hour, with no movement from the bus, Zhang Lan couldn’t help but wonder if they had been discovered.\n\n“We can only continue to wait.” At first, Ye Bin was anxious to get closer and investigate, but after an hour of observation, Ye Bin had calmed down.\n\n“Continuing to wait isn’t a solution either. How about, according to your earlier idea, we move a bit closer and see if we can discover anything?” After observing for a long time, Zhang Lan’s patience was gradually wearing thin.\n\nYe Bin simply shook his head slightly, rejecting Zhang Lan’s suggestion. “Lan Ge, I didn’t think so at first, but the longer I wait, the more I feel like that bus is waiting for us to appear.”\n\n“Waiting for us to appear?” Zhang Lan looked at Ye Bin with confusion, unable to understand his words.\n\n“Yeah. It’s just a feeling. If we go out now, something will definitely happen.” Ye Bin had absolute confidence in his intuition.\n\n“I also feel like that bus gives off a strange feeling, but I can’t quite pinpoint what’s strange about it. However, your intuition is probably right. That bus wouldn’t appear for no reason. Since it appeared, there must be some reason. Perhaps it’s a trap to lure us out.”\n\n“Lan Ge, although the headlights are dazzling and I can’t see the body of the bus behind them, judging by the silhouette of the vehicle, I think it’s definitely the ‘Route 18’ bus.”\n\n“If we’re trapped in an illusion, and it’s really that little girl’s doing, then the appearance of the ‘Route 18’ bus isn’t surprising. But what I’m confused about now is, what is that little girl’s goal? Just to keep us trapped in this illusion?” Zhang Lan kept pondering the little girl’s objective in trapping their group in the illusion.\n\n“Lan Ge, although it’s just a feeling, I always feel that this illusion is a bit strange. Like those strange statues before, I think someone might be trying to convey some information to us.”\n\n“Convey information? This is just an illusion, everything we see is a false appearance. Those statues before might just be the little girl trying to confuse us.”\n\n“If it’s to confuse us, then why?”\n\n“Why? Could it be? The other party is trying to use those strange statues to hide something?” Zhang Lan murmured, lost in thought.\n\n“Not just those statues, but also the symbols on the statues, they probably have some meaning too.” Ye Bin said, his brow furrowed, lost in thought.\n\nJust as Ye Bin was lost in thought, the headlights of the bus at the intersection suddenly went out. Then, from the right side door of the bus, an adult figure slowly emerged.\n\n“Someone!” Seeing the adult figure, the gazes of Ye Bin and Zhang Lan both sharpened. But due to the absence of headlights, and the fact that the light from the intersection’s streetlights was too dim, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan couldn’t discern the figure’s appearance at all, only able to judge from the overall silhouette that it was likely an adult.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 188: The Duo Under Surveillance\n\n\"The light is too dim, I can't make out his features, but judging by his build, it should be a man,\" Zhang Lan carefully observed the figure disembarking from the right side door of the bus and made his judgment.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Ye Bin nodded, not disagreeing with Zhang Lan's assessment. \"That person seems to be looking for something.\"\n\nThe mysterious man who got off the bus, after alighting, kept scanning his surroundings, as if searching for something.\n\n\"Could he be looking for us?\" Zhang Lan said gravely, a bad feeling stirring within him.\n\n\"Whether he is or not, be careful,\" Ye Bin said, signaling Zhang Lan to conceal himself further.\n\nTo avoid being discovered by the mysterious man who had just exited the bus, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan leaned against the walls on either side of the bar's glass door, only peeking out their heads to continue watching the intersection.\n\n\"Binzi, he's looking in our direction. Did he spot us?\" As Zhang Lan was observing the mysterious man, he suddenly felt the man's gaze fixed directly towards their location.\n\n\"Brother Lan, stop looking, hide!\" Ye Bin had the same feeling as Zhang Lan and immediately signaled Zhang Lan to move away from the bar door. Then, the two of them hid beneath the bar counter.\n\nTime ticked by. Ye Bin and Zhang Lan hid beneath the bar counter for about ten minutes, but nothing happened. This made Zhang Lan think they were being overly anxious.\n\n\"Binzi, it seems we were too tense. He didn't notice us, otherwise, he would have come over by now,\" Zhang Lan whispered, talking to Ye Bin.\n\n\"Brother Lan, don't come out yet. I'll go take a look.\" Even though there was no movement outside, Ye Bin remained on guard.\n\nCarefully emerging from under the counter, Ye Bin walked to the bar's main entrance, leaned against the wall, and cautiously peeked his head out to look in the direction of the intersection.\n\nThe moment he looked towards the intersection, Ye Bin's expression immediately turned grim. The bus that had been parked at the intersection was gone. Apart from the dim streetlights, Ye Bin saw nothing.\n\n\"Binzi, what's up? Any discoveries?\" Zhang Lan peeked out from under the counter and asked Ye Bin in a low voice.\n\nYe Bin pointed a finger outside the door and then shook his head, indicating that the bus outside had disappeared.\n\n\"You mean? That bus is gone?\" Zhang Lan understood Ye Bin's meaning and immediately crawled out from under the counter, hopped over it, and walked to Ye Bin's side. \"The bus is gone?\" Zhang Lan asked Ye Bin while peering out the door. After confirming the bus at the intersection had vanished, Zhang Lan's face fell, and a very bad premonition arose within him. \"How could it have disappeared so suddenly!\"\n\n\"Brother Lan, the bar has a back door. Let's leave through the back door and get out of here. I have a feeling this place is being watched by something terrible.\" After the bus disappeared, Ye Bin had a thought: the mysterious man before must have noticed them.\n\n\"Where does the back door lead?\"\n\n\"To a small alley. From the alley, we should be able to get into the nearest shopping mall.\" Ye Bin had already surveyed the terrain, preparing for a swift retreat.\n\n\"Mhm, I also think we shouldn't stay here long. Let's go, if it's not far, we'll be able to detect Qianxing and the others as soon as they return.\" After speaking, the two walked to the bar's back door, preparing to enter the nearest shopping mall via the alley.\n\nHowever, when Ye Bin and Zhang Lan reached the back door, they suddenly discovered that the back door, which had not been locked before, was now inexplicably locked.\n\n\"The door is locked.\" Ye Bin was taken aback when he found the back door locked, knowing that he had checked it not long ago and confirmed it wasn't locked.\n\n\"Binzi, you checked here before, wasn't the door unlocked?\" Zhang Lan asked Ye Bin while trying to open the back door, but found it was now securely locked.\n\n\"When we realized Qianxing and the others were missing, I checked the back door and confirmed it wasn't locked. Also, after we searched for Qianxing and the others and returned to the bar, I checked the back door again, and it still wasn't locked.\" Ye Bin had checked the bar's back door multiple times, and each time, it was unlocked.\n\n\"Could you have accidentally locked it?\" Zhang Lan guessed, but then shook his head, dismissing the thought. After all, given Ye Bin's meticulous nature, such a mistake was unlikely. \"Was the back door locked while we were hiding under the counter? Could it be related to that mysterious person?\" Zhang Lan said, recalling the mysterious man who had descended from the bus earlier.\n\n\"If we want to leave the bar, we can only go through the front door.\"\n\n\"What about going through the window on the side?\" Zhang Lan said, pointing to a window on the right side of the hotel, covered by curtains.\n\n\"No, going out through that window leads to the other side of the intersection, which is no different from going through the bar's main entrance.\" Ye Bin had checked very thoroughly and had a complete grasp of the bar's layout.\n\n\"What about the restroom? There's also a small window in the restroom. How about going through there?\"\n\n\"One side of the restroom window is nailed shut, and the other side, we can't get through at all.\"\n\n\"What about anywhere else? Is there no other safe exit besides the back door?\"\n\nYe Bin shook his head and sighed with some helplessness.\n\n\"I'll go take another look. If it seems safe, we should be fine going through the front door.\" Zhang Lan said, walking back to the bar's entrance and peeking out to observe the outside.\n\nAfter Zhang Lan's careful observation, he found no anomalies and quietly called out to Ye Bin. \"Binzi! There's nothing outside. Maybe that bus and the mysterious person have already left. Let's go through the front door!\"\n\nYe Bin didn't answer Zhang Lan. Instead, he walked to Zhang Lan's side, also peeking out. Although, as Zhang Lan said, there was nothing unusual outside, Ye Bin had a strong premonition that if they left through the front door, something would happen.\n\n\"Brother Lan, I think we should think of another way. I have a feeling it's dangerous to go through the front door.\"\n\nHearing Ye Bin's words, Zhang Lan didn't object. Instead, he nodded. \"To be honest, it's not just you. I have that feeling too. I also feel like something will happen if we go through the front door. And I've been wondering, that mysterious person earlier really seemed to have seen us.\" Zhang Lan frowned. Thinking back to what just happened, he felt they were already being targeted by something terrible.\n\n\"To be safe, let's think of other ways. See if we can find a way to unlock the back door. I think there might be a key inside the bar.\"\n\n(End of chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 189: Ye Bin's Conjecture\n\nAfter discovering the back door of the bar was locked, Ye Bin and the other man began searching the bar for the key. However, after nearly half an hour of searching, they had scoured every corner of the bar but still couldn't find the key to the back door.\n\n\"We've searched everywhere and still haven't found the key. It seems someone doesn't want us to leave through the back door,\" Zhang Lan said with a grim expression, his gaze fixed on the front entrance of the bar as he made a guess.\n\n\"What exactly is their objective? Are they just trying to trap us here?\" Ye Bin found the situation strange. If they were being targeted, why hadn't the other party appeared yet, choosing instead to cut off their escape route and trap them in the bar?\n\n\"Could it be that the person targeting us can't get into this bar?\" Zhang Lan speculated.\n\nYe Bin shook his head, disagreeing with Zhang Lan's guess. \"I don't think so. If the other party truly couldn't enter the bar, why would they lock the back door? Wouldn't it be better to let us leave?\"\n\nHearing Ye Bin's response, Zhang Lan nodded. \"That makes sense. If the other party couldn't enter the bar, they should have enticed us to leave the bar, not locked the back door and trapped us inside.\"\n\n\"Brother Lan, do you think the person targeting us specifically locked the back door, knowing we are cautious and wouldn't leave through the front door, and deliberately trapped us in the bar?\" Ye Bin mused, forming a hypothesis.\n\n\"Deliberately trapping us in the bar? Why?\" Zhang Lan frowned, unable to comprehend Ye Bin's reasoning.\n\n\"Although it's just a guess, I think perhaps the other party trapped us in the bar to protect us?\"\n\n\"Protect us? Why do you think that?\" Zhang Lan looked at Ye Bin, his mind filled with questions.\n\n\"Brother Lan, we discussed earlier that the bus stopped at the intersection, likely to lure us out. Since the other party wanted to lure us out, there's no reason for them to lock the back door when we intended to leave the bar,\" Ye Bin began to analyze the current situation piece by piece.\n\n\"Mmm,\" Zhang Lan nodded, not questioning Ye Bin's analysis, as he had shared similar thoughts previously.\n\n\"Since the other party was luring us out, could we make another guess: that someone else in the shadows, to prevent us from leaving the bar and falling into danger, locked the back door to stop us from leaving?\" Ye Bin continued his analysis.\n\n\"If that's the case, then why did they only lock the back door? If they really wanted to stop us from leaving, they should have locked both the front and back doors!\" Zhang Lan raised a question about Ye Bin's subsequent analysis.\n\n\"I have an idea about that too. There are two reasons why they only locked the back door and not the front door: First, they couldn't lock the front door because there are people waiting in ambush for us at the front door; Second, they only locked the back door because they are confident in us, knowing we wouldn't risk leaving through the front door.\"\n\nAfter listening to Ye Bin's analysis, Zhang Lan frowned. Although Ye Bin's words had some truth to them, Zhang Lan still felt that Ye Bin's conjectures were full of assumptions and not entirely accurate.\n\n\"Binzi, what you're saying does have some logic, and it makes sense from a logical standpoint, but I still feel, considering we are trapped in this illusion, how could there be someone helping us within this illusion?\"\n\n\"Brother Lan, don't you find the silhouette of the mysterious man who got off the bus earlier familiar?\" Ye Bin asked, reminding Zhang Lan.\n\n\"Familiar? The person who got off the bus was so dark, I couldn't even see their face clearly, just a blurry outline. How could I tell if it was familiar?\" Zhang Lan chuckled awkwardly, expressing his doubts about Ye Bin's statement.\n\n\"Brother Lan, do you think the person who got off the bus might be Uncle Xu?\" Ye Bin's next words made Zhang Lan freeze for a moment, then look at Ye Bin with a confused expression.\n\n\"Binzi! Where did you get that idea? It was dark, just an outline, and you're saying you recognized it as Old Xu?\" Zhang Lan questioned Ye Bin with a tone of disbelief, not thinking Ye Bin could have made any judgment in such a situation.\n\n\"There's no definitive evidence, but based on the silhouette, the height and build of that figure seemed to be similar to Uncle Xu.\"\n\n\"Binzi, are you still drunk? At such a distance, coupled with the dim environment, how could you make these judgments?\" After hearing Ye Bin's words, Zhang Lan couldn't help but think Ye Bin was talking nonsense.\n\n\"Brother Lan, I know I have no evidence for what I'm saying, but I really have a feeling that the figure who got off the bus is Uncle Xu!\" Ye Bin's words were firm, as if he had already convinced himself that the figure who got off the bus was Old Xu.\n\n\"If that figure truly is Uncle Xu, then my previous conjecture can be established: Uncle Xu locked the back door to protect us, preventing us from leaving the bar.\"\n\n\"Binzi, I know that Old Xu's situation has dealt you a heavy blow, but as things stand, the most important thing now is to find Qianhang and the others and find a way to leave this illusion!\" Zhang Lan believed that Ye Bin's conjecture was due to the severe blow he suffered regarding Old Xu's situation, leading him to make a wrong judgment and mistake the figure who got off the bus for Old Xu.\n\n\"Brother Lan, although I know I never believe in intuition, this time I'm confident my intuition is correct. The person who got off the bus is indeed Uncle Xu!\" Ye Bin spoke again, firming his conjecture.\n\n\"Binzi, you always say that everything requires evidence. What evidence do you have to prove that the figure who got off the bus is Old Xu? Relying on intuition?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Ye Bin's answer was concise and clear.\n\n\"...\" Seeing Ye Bin's resolute answer, Zhang Lan was speechless for a moment. \"Binzi, I...\" Zhang Lan said, shaking his head and sighing helplessly, not continuing.\n\n\"Brother Lan, I know my idea is a bit far-fetched, but is there anything more far-fetched than what we are currently experiencing?\"\n\n\"That's true, but if it were real, how could Old Xu appear in this illusion? Moreover, if Old Xu is really helping us, why hasn't he appeared? And, most importantly, as you saw earlier, Old Xu's name appeared on the building's signage. Based on our analysis, Old Xu he...\" At this point, Zhang Lan fell silent, not continuing. \"Binzi, to be honest, I also wish it was Old Xu helping us, but you should know, that's impossible.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 190: Angel and Demon\n\nLegend tells of an angel, once revered by all, who overnight fell and became a demon loathed by all.\n\nAfter transforming into a demon, the angel brought wave after wave of disaster upon the mortal realm, causing countless lives to perish.\n\nWhen the transformed angel once again brought forth a disaster, the people within it questioned the angel.\n\n\"Angel! Why do you bring disaster? Why did you willingly fall and become a demon?\"\n\nEveryone harbored a single question: what had the former angel endured that caused them to fall into a demon overnight?\n\nFacing the people's questions, the angel offered no reply, and after bringing forth the disaster, turned and departed.\n\nAs the people in the disaster watched the angel's receding back, their last shred of hope was extinguished. They began to curse, using the most venomous words to damn the angel.\n\nThe holy wings began to decay, the angel's appearance changed, and the once sacred image vanished. Under the people's curses, the angel completely transformed into a \"demon.\"\n\nUpon finding a picture book at the entrance of one of the \"playhouses,\" Lin Xiao deduced that other items might be present. Therefore, the group re-examined the three damaged \"playhouses.\" Finally, inside one of the \"playhouses,\" the trio discovered a \"diary.\"\n\n\"Apart from the few scribbled lines on the first page, the diary contains no other entries, only dates written on every subsequent page,\" Chen Hui said, flipping through the diary. Aside from the first page, the others simply bore a date.\n\n\"Angel, demon, what does it mean?\" Lu Qianxing frowned, utterly perplexed by the content on the first page of the diary.\n\n\"Is this diary about a Western fairy tale? Perhaps this diary is just a notebook a child uses for homework,\" Chen Hui suggested, believing the diary they found might merely be a \"homework notebook\" for a child.\n\n\"Could a child write like this?\" Lu Qianxing disagreed with Chen Hui's speculation. Although the writing in the diary was messy, it was clear at a glance that the writer was no child.\n\n\"That's true. While the writing is a bit ugly, each stroke, each line is quite strong. A child probably couldn't write it,\" Chen Hui conceded after listening to Lu Qianxing, realizing his own guess was somewhat unrealistic. \"However, the dates written in this diary are crooked. I'm certain a child wrote them,\" Chen Hui stated, flipping through the diary for Lu Qianxing and Lin Xiao to see the dates written on each page.\n\n\"Like the picture book, is it from two people?\" Lu Qianxing's brow furrowed upon noticing that the writing in the diary and the dates differed.\n\n\"This writing style clearly belongs to two people. Moreover, I believe the dates were written by a child, and the content on the first page was written by an adult,\" Chen Hui concluded easily after comparing the handwriting of the dates and the content.\n\n\"Indeed, it's very obvious,\" Lu Qianxing nodded in agreement with Chen Hui's conclusion.\n\n\"Detective Lin, what are your thoughts?\" Seeing that Lin Xiao had remained silent, Chen Hui curiously asked him about his opinion on the diary.\n\n\"Consistent with your speculations,\" Lin Xiao replied calmly, seemingly not very interested in the diary.\n\n\"Detective Lin, what do you think of the content on the first page of the diary?\" Chen Hui pressed again.\n\n\"The story of an angel falling into a demon,\" Lin Xiao answered Chen Hui's question calmly.\n\n\"Detective Lin, have you heard of the content on the first page?\"\n\n\"It's a Western fairy tale. That angel is known as the 'Fallen Angel.' The reason he became a demon was because he witnessed the darkness of the human world and used disaster to kill those burdened by sin.\"\n\n\"He merely killed those burdened by sin? In that case, this angel shouldn't be a demon!\" Chen Hui felt that if the angel only killed sinful individuals, then he wasn't a demon.\n\n\"He violated the duties of an angel. An angel's duty is to protect, not to kill.\"\n\n\"But those were people burdened by sin!\" Chen Hui couldn't comprehend Lin Xiao's reasoning. In his understanding, the angel's punishment of sinful individuals was entirely correct.\n\n\"What if everyone in the world is burdened by sin? Does that mean the angel should exterminate all humankind?\" Lin Xiao's next statement stunned Chen Hui, leaving him momentarily speechless and unable to retort.\n\n\"This...\"\n\n\"As a former police officer, you should know that even the police cannot arbitrarily punish a person's mistakes. Everything must be adjudicated by law.\"\n\n\"What if the law cannot adjudicate?\" Before Chen Hui could speak, Lu Qianxing interjected in a deep voice, questioning Lin Xiao.\n\n\"That's why the angel turned into a demon.\" Lin Xiao's answer was extremely calm in response to Lu Qianxing's question.\n\nUpon hearing Lin Xiao's reply, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing were both taken aback. They both understood something from Lin Xiao's words.\n\nWhile Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing were stunned, Lin Xiao took out the previous picture book and, looking at the illustrations, combined with the newly discovered diary, fell into deep thought.\n\n\"What's wrong, Detective Lin? Have you made any new discoveries?\" Seeing Lin Xiao carefully comparing the picture book and the diary, Chen Hui stepped forward to ask.\n\n\"I believe there's a connection between the drawings in the picture book and the entries in this diary. The picture book was drawn by two people, and the diary has two distinct handwriting styles,\" Lin Xiao stated gravely, his gaze still fixed on the comparison of the picture book and the diary.\n\n\"Could the two people who drew the picture book be the same two people who wrote in the diary?\" Lu Qianxing suddenly realized something and spoke up.\n\n\"It's not impossible, but we can't make a definitive conclusion yet. The handwriting in the diary and the drawings in the picture book have some differences. It can be simply concluded that the artists and the diary writers are not the same two people, but rather four individuals in total.\"\n\n\"Differences? What differences?\" Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing simultaneously compared the drawings in the picture book with the handwriting in the diary. They couldn't find any differences. In fact, they didn't even know how to discern if there was a connection between the drawings and the handwriting.\n\n\"The pressure of the pen. Look closely. The lightness and darkness of the ink in the picture book can reveal the intensity of the artist's pen pressure while drawing. Similarly, in the diary, the pressure of the pen used for the diary entries and the dates can be seen. This pressure is entirely different from the pressure used for the ink in the picture book. Therefore, I conclude that the drawings in the picture book and the content in the diary were not created by two people, but by four.\"\n\n\"Pen pressure! How can you distinguish that!\" Chen Hui's face was filled with astonishment. He found Lin Xiao's judgment difficult to comprehend.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 191 Fantasy\n\n\"How, how, how, how,\" On the dark night, on the street that was forgotten, a little girl in a white dress curled up on the corner of the street, and the water kept falling from her face. She was lonely, helpless, and desperately covered the young girl.\n\n\"What's the point of crying? Can your father and mother come back to cry? Will everything be better? Can you leave this desperate place?\" Somehow, another little girl appeared beside the little girl, wearing a black dress. In addition, the little girl in black dress, all the same as the curled little girl.\n\nWhen I heard the little girl in black dress, the curled girl raised her head slowly. When I saw the little girl in front of me, the curled girl was stunned. \"Who are you?\" Seeing the little girl in front of me, except for the clothes she was wearing, they were exactly the same as herself. The curled girl showed a scared expression on her face.\n\n\"I'm you,\" said the little girl in black dress with a smile and said, \"\n\n\"You are me.\" The curled little girl stopped crying. When she heard the little girl in black dress, her eyes became fascinated in an instant.\n\n\"Yes, I'll just follow me, I'll take you to see my dad and mom.\" The little girl in black dress said, stretching out her hand to the curled little girl\n\n\"You can really take me to see my dad and mom.\" The curled little girl wiped the purplish water from her face with her hands and looked at the little girl in black dress with her eyes full of expectations.\n\nThe little girl in black dress once again smiled, \"Of course\"\n\n\"Dad, mother, are they waiting for me?\" After hearing that they could see their parents again, the curled little girl opened her mouth excitedly.\n\n\"They are waiting for you, let's go.\"\n\n\"Okay\" The curled little girl smiled slightly, and the next moment, she held the little girl in black dress.\n\nThe moment the curled little girl's hands touched the black dress, the curled little girl's eyes solidified in an instant. The next moment, the white dress on the little girl's body dyed black at a speed visible to the naked eye.\n\n\"Hehehe, from today on, we are the same person.\" After seeing all the clothes on the curled little girl were dyed black, the little girl in black dress had a palpitations smile on her face.\n\nOn the dark night, the quiet street, the two names have the same appearance and uniform clothes, just like a little girl carved from a mold, holding hands and moving forward along the street\n\n\"Detective Lin, besides using pen strength, can't there be any other proven method?\" Whether Chen Xi carefully observed and studied, Chen Xi could not make a clear judgment.\n\n\"No,\" Lin Qing opened his voice in a deep voice, and his answer was very fruitful.\n\n\"Although the strength of the pen looks a little different, isn't it a bit abrupt if you just want to stop this?\" Although Ru Qianxing had already recognized Lin Jun's ability at this moment, Ru Qianxing still had doubts in his heart due to Lin Jun's judgment this time.\n\n\"Hehehe, hehehehehe\"Just as Chen Xi and the other two compared the book and diary, a creepy laugh suddenly came from outside the mall.\n\n\"What sound?\" The moment he heard the terrifying laughter, Chen Xi walked steadily and walked to the side of Ru Qianxing. Then he hugged Ru Qianxing's arm with both hands tightly and tightly.\n\n\"It's that little girl.\" Liu Qianxing's face sank to the point in an instant. When he heard the terrifying laughter, Liu Qianxing looked around everywhere, trying to find out the source of the sound\n\n\"The sound is transmitted from outside the mall.\" Compared with Chen Liu and Lu Qianxing, Lin Xun's face was still calm. The first time was to accurately determine that the sound was transmitted from outside the mall.\n\n\"Detective Lin, you stay here, I'll go and take a look.\" Liu Qianxing said, walked to Lin Jun's side, and handed Chen Hui, who was holding his arm, to Lin Jun. After that, he was going outside the business hall.\n\nBefore Lu Qianxing could walk a few steps, Lin Xun reached out and grabbed Lu Qianxing's clothes. \"Don't act rashly for now. If we get separated again, it will be irritating.\"\n\nWhen he heard Lin Xun, Lu Qianxington was stunned. The next moment he realized something, then stopped walking, stood there, and did not choose to continue walking outside the business.\n\n\"Detective Lin, Brother Xu, you are closer to me, don't separate from me,\" said Lu Qianxing, and moved back a few steps, and walked to Lin and the other side.\n\nChen Liu slid his eyes, closed his eyes, and wrote a fear of fear, \"Qianxing, why should we find a place to hide first?\" Chen Liu opened his voice tremblingly. At this time, he just wanted to find a safe place to hide.\n\n\"It's useless. According to our previous guesses, this is the dream of the other party. In the dream of the other party, he hides, but he's just deceiving himself.\" Lin Xu opened his mouth calmly, his expression still very calm, as if he was not afraid of the heart-wrenching laughter at all.\n\n\"Then we are not dead.\" When Chen Liu heard Lin Xu's words, he couldn't help but call him a cold man.\n\n\"Don't worry, if my guess is not wrong, this is just a dream situation, and there is still a way to do it.\"\n\n\"What is the way to do it?\" Not only Chen Liu, but also Qianxing, all looked at Lin Jun confusedly, because facing the current situation, Qianxing could not think of any way to do it.\n\n\"The dream is just a virtual world. Then, in this virtual world, even our fantasy should be real.\" Lin said, stretching out his right hand, and the next moment, a talisman appeared in Lin Jun's palm, and that talisman was the talisman that was previously distributed to everyone by thousands of lines.\n\n\"This\" Seeing the talisman on Lin Xu's hand, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui were both stunned.\n\n\"You remember the talisman paper.\" Lu Qianxing looked at Lin Xun with a pressure-reducing gaze. He never expected that Lin Xun could clearly remember the talisman paper he had distributed to everyone before.\n\n\"It's consistent with what I think. Since it's a dream, then even our fantasy can come true.\" Lin Qing did not care about Lu Qianxing's surprise, but looked at the talisman in his hand and murmured lightly.\n\n\"Fantasy comes true\"When hearing Lin's words, Chen Xi hurriedly closed his eyes and began to fantasize, but no matter how he fantasizes in his heart, his fantasy never realized \"strange why my fantasy has no effect\"\n\n\"What are you fantasizing about?\"\n\n\"I'm fantasizing about a road that can leave here.\" After a long time there was no effect, Chen Hui had to give up the fantasy in his heart.\n\n\"Even if it is a fantasy, there are restrictions. After all, this is the dream of the other party.\" In fact, before the fantasy tale, Lin Jun also had other fantasies, but there was no realization, so Lin Jun guessed that if the fantasy in the dream state was to be realized, there were certain restrictions.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

Ye Bin and Zhang Lan, hiding beside the bar's entrance, poked their heads out to look.\n\n\"It's that little girl!\" Looking outside, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan saw a little girl huddled by the street not far from the bar, crying.\n\n\"No, Brother Lan, the little girl we saw before had a black dress,\" Ye Bin noted that although the little girl huddled by the street was the same as the one they had seen before, the dress she was wearing was not black, but a pure white one.\n\n\"The appearance is the same, only the clothes have changed. It should still be the same little girl.\" Zhang Lan carefully observed the little girl on the street and found that except for the change in her clothing, everything else was exactly the same as the little girl he had seen before. \"Besides, the clothes only seem to have changed color, with no other alterations.\"\n\n\"Even so, I have a feeling something is not right. The previous little girl gave me a sense of dread, but this little girl here only evokes pity,\" Ye Bin said with a frown, feeling that the little girl in front of him was just an ordinary child and wouldn't make him feel afraid.\n\nHearing Ye Bin's words, Zhang Lan nodded thoughtfully, \"Indeed, now that you mention it, I also feel that compared to the fear the previous little girl gave me, I feel no fear from this little girl.\" Recalling the previous little girl and comparing her to the one in front of them, Zhang Lan had the same feeling as Ye Bin.\n\n\"Uncle... Uncle, save me! Save me!\" While Ye Bin and Zhang Lan were still discussing whether the little girl in front of them was the same one they had seen before, the little girl huddled outside the bar suddenly looked up, her eyes teary, her tender face smudged with some dirt, making her look very pitiful.\n\nAs soon as the little girl finished speaking, a blurry figure appeared behind her.\n\n\"Where are you going? Are you going to leave me?\" a pair of tender hands rested on the little girl's shoulders, and then the blurry figure gradually became clearer.\n\n\"It's her!\" Upon seeing the figure behind the little girl, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan were instantly stunned, and cold sweat broke out on their foreheads.\n\nThe figure behind the little girl was almost identical to her, with the only difference being the dress she wore. The little girl wore a white dress, while the figure behind her wore a black dress.\n\n\"Uncle! Save me!\" The little girl in the white dress reached out and pleaded with Ye Bin and Zhang Lan with a voice full of despair.\n\n\"Are you going to leave me?\" Behind the little girl, the one in the black dress wrapped an arm around the girl's neck, her head leaning in, and said with a smile.\n\n\"Binzi!\" Zhang Lan said with a grim expression. For a moment, seeing the despair in the little girl's eyes, Zhang Lan wished he could rush out immediately and save her.\n\n\"Brother Lan, calm down! Don't forget! We are in an illusion, and this might just be a trap set by the other party to lure us out!\" Ye Bin grabbed Zhang Lan's arm, but could clearly feel Zhang Lan trembling all over.\n\n\"Hehehe, hehehe.\" The little girl in the black dress behind the other girl suddenly looked up and gave Ye Bin and Zhang Lan a bone-chilling smile.\n\n\"Let's go.\" The girl in the black dress took the hand of the little girl, and then, much to the little girl's reluctance, the girl in the black dress forcibly dragged her away.\n\n\"Uncle! Save me! Save me!\" The little girl's desperate cries sounded again. Seeing the helplessness on the little girl's face, Zhang Lan gritted his teeth, wishing he could immediately go out and snatch the little girl back from the other's grasp.\n\n\"Binzi, are we really going to do nothing? The child's eyes aren't lying!\" Judging by the little girl's eyes, Zhang Lan felt that it wasn't all an illusion.\n\nYe Bin didn't answer Zhang Lan's question. In fact, he was also struggling internally, debating whether or not to risk rescuing the little girl. Although they were indeed in an illusion, Ye Bin could also feel from the little girl's desperate eyes that everything in front of them might not be entirely fake, and the little girl might very well be real.\n\n\"Binzi, if we don't decide soon, it will be too late!\" Zhang Lan said anxiously, watching the little girl's figure gradually disappear, afraid that if they were any later, they wouldn't be able to catch up.\n\nYe Bin frowned, his heart also conflicted. But upon hearing the little girl's desperate plea once more, the softest part of Ye Bin's heart was touched. \"Brother Lan, I'm going! Wait for me! If anything dangerous happens, don't come out!\" Ye Bin said, without any further thought, he took a step forward, pushed open the bar door, and rushed directly towards the little girl being taken away.\n\n\"Binzi!\" Before Zhang Lan could react, Ye Bin had already rushed out of the bar. Seeing Ye Bin rush out, Zhang Lan didn't hesitate and followed Ye Bin, also rushing out of the establishment.\n\n\"Child! Grab Uncle's hand!\" When Ye Bin reached the little girl, he grabbed her hand. Immediately, Ye Bin could clearly feel that the little girl's hand was warm. The moment he felt the warmth of her hand, Ye Bin became certain that the little girl was real.\n\n\"Hehehe, hehehe, are you guys going to accompany me too?\" The little girl in the black dress turned around and said with a smile that made Ye Bin's blood run cold.\n\nYe Bin's body trembled, and his heart was filled with fear, but even so, Ye Bin gritted his teeth and did not let go of the little girl's hand.\n\n\"Binzi! Don't be afraid! At worst, it's just death! Let's go together, brother! I want to see what's so scary!\" Zhang Lan stood beside Ye Bin and placed a hand on Ye Bin's shoulder. Although Zhang Lan appeared calm, Ye Bin knew that Zhang Lan was merely suppressing his fear and comforting himself.\n\n\"Child! Don't be afraid, come with Uncle!\" While speaking, Ye Bin stepped forward and picked up the little girl. The moment Ye Bin picked up the little girl, the hand of the girl in the black dress suddenly let go, and then her figure began to slowly fade away.\n\n\"Uncle...\" Held by Ye Bin, the little girl's despairing gaze turned blank at this moment.\n\n\"Don't be afraid! Your uncles are here!\" Ye Bin said with a smile. For some reason, the moment he picked up the little girl, the fear in his heart vanished.\n\n\"Uncle, aren't you afraid? You'll die.\"\n\n\"I am afraid! But I'm more afraid that my heart will die.\" Ye Bin affectionately stroked the little girl's head and said with a smile.\n\nHearing Ye Bin's words, the little girl was first stunned, and then two lines of tears streamed down her cheeks.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 193 The big hand that poked out in the hope\n\n\"Where are dad and mom, why didn't I see them?\" In the darkness, two figures stood. Apart from the different clothes on the two figures, everything was like a mold carved out, exactly the same\n\n\"Do you want to see them?\" The little girl wearing a black dress opened her mouth with an expressionless face, and looked coldly at the little girl wearing a white dress beside her.\n\n\"Of course, didn't you say that you want to take me to find my father and mother, where are they?\" The little girl in a white dress opened her mouth anxiously, even though she grabbed the little girl in a black dress.\n\nThe little girl in a black dress did not openly answer the little girl in a white dress, but raised her hand slowly and pointed to the distance.\n\nLooking around the point where the little girl in the black dress pointed, the little girl in the white dress found that in the dark, there were two familiar backs. Seeing this scene, the little girl in the white dress showed an excited smile on her face. Then, the little girl in the white dress didn't think much, and relaxed the little girl in the black dress and ran to the two familiar backs far away.\n\n\"Dad, Mom\" The little girl in white dress opened her mouth excitedly and ran to the two familiar backs far away with expectations. Then, the little girl opened her hand and hugged one of the backs. \"Dad, Mom, don't let me go, I'm afraid.\" While hugging one of the backs, the little girl's face was filled with tears and water.\n\nFacing the little girl's hug, the two backs did not react at all, and they did not return to their heads from beginning to end.\n\nHe cried for a long time while holding one of the backs. When the little girl in white dress saw the other party, she never paid attention to her. She raised her head slowly and saw the two backs. When the little girl saw the two backs, the little girl's face suddenly sank. Then she wiped her face with a heavy fear. After she opened the backs she was holding, the little girl sat on the ground and moved back in fear.\n\n\"Dad, Mom\" The little girl in white dress opened her mouth with a tall and handsome face, looking at the two backs in front of her, her eyes solidified in an instant\n\n\"Are you afraid?\" Just when the little girl in a white dress was scared by the scene in front of her, the little girl in a black dress appeared beside the little girl in a white dress for some time.\n\n\"Who are they?\" The little girl in a white dress opened her mouth crying and looked at the little girl in a black dress beside her.\n\n\"Don't you recognize them, they are father and mother?\" The little girl in black dress smiled and opened her mouth, her smile a little scary.\n\n\"No, they are not them, they are not father and mother.\" The little girl cried and opened her mouth, crying, and moved backwards.\n\nThe two back faces were covered with blood, and they couldn't see their appearance clearly, especially one of them, half of which was covered with blood and blood, and looked very terrifying.\n\n\"Do you don't know your dad or mom?\" The little girl in black dress opened her mouth coldly, and her voice suddenly became cold.\"No, they are not father and mother.\" The little girl in a white dress slammed her head and cried, and she couldn't agree with the little girl in a black dress.\n\n\"Xiaoyi, don't you remember your mother?\" Just as the little girl refused vigorously, the half-faced figure suddenly opened her mouth, and the sound was extremely soft.\n\nThe moment he heard the soft sound, the little girl in white dress stood there alone, because she heard the sound at the first time that it was not someone else's, but her mother's.\n\n\"Mom,\" murmured in the white dress, but when he saw the bloody and bloody face, the white dress girl bit her lips in fear and was unwilling to believe that the figure in front of her was her mother\n\n\"Xiaoyi, come here to mom, I miss you.\" The bloody figure opened her hands and wanted to hug the little girl in the white dress, but the little girl in the white dress moved back and did not dare to approach the terrifying figure in front of her.\n\n\"Mom is calling you why don't you go? Don't you want to see her?\" The little girl in the white dress retreated. The little girl in the black dress next to her grabbed the white girl's hand, making the little girl in the white dress unable to move backwards again.\n\n\"Xiaoyi, why are you doing this, don't you want your mother? Didn't you say that you should always be with your mother?\" The soft voice echoed again, forming an extreme contrast with her terrifying appearance.\n\n\"Me\" the little girl in a white dress bit her lips tightly, and she wanted to say something, but she never said anything.\n\n\"Xiaoyi, don't be afraid, come here,\" the terrifying figure said, approaching the little girl as he approached the little girl\n\n\"I don't want me, I don't want my mother.\" Seeing the terrifying figure approaching her, the little girl in a white dress opened her mouth in fear. In the next moment, the terrifying figure stopped moving forward and stood there in a daze.\n\nAfter a long time, that terrifying figure was the silence of opening the mouth, \"Xiaoyi, are you afraid of your mother? Do you want to leave your mother?\" With three questions, the soft voice gradually became colder.\n\n\"You are not a mother, you are not a mother.\" The little girl in white dress bit her lips and opened her mouth\n\n\"You know, why mother turned into this because you were all because of you.\" Suddenly, the soft voice became terrifying, and on that bloody face, there were two bloody lights flashing.\n\n\"It's not me, it's not me.\" The little girl snatched her head in fear\n\n\"You don't want your mother, why can you not want your mother? Mom has done so much for you. Why do you want to leave me? Why are you afraid of me?\" The terrifying figure continued to approach the little girl in the white dress. Just when the terrifying figure was only a short distance from the white dress, a big hand stuck out and firmly pressed the terrifying figure.\n\n\"I don't want you to hurt her.\" The cold voice was filled with a terrible force. The big hand firmly pressed the terrifying sound, making the terrifying figure unable to move.\n\n\"dad\"The moment I heard the cold sound, the little girl saw that behind the terrifying figure, another figure whose appearance was covered by blood was squinting over the terrifying figure.\n\n\"Dad\" Beside the little girl in white dress, the little girl in black dress saw this scene again, and she was surprised on her face. Obviously, she never expected that such a situation would appear.\n\n\"I don't allow anyone to hurt my daughter.\" Another figure behind the terrifying figure opened his mouth with a roaring sound. The rough big hand pressed the terrifying figure's shoulders tightly, protecting the little girl in white dress.\n\n\"dad\"\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 194 Hide-and-Seek\n\n\"All exits are locked. It seems we're completely trapped here.\" Chen Hui and the other two checked all the exits in the mall, only to find that every exit was tightly locked, making it impossible to leave.\n\n\"I remember there's a fire axe in the fire escape on the third floor, east side. We can use that axe to smash the glass door at the north exit,\" Lin Xiao said, holding both his sketchbook and diary. He continued to compare the two while giving instructions to Chen Hui and the other.\n\n\"Fire axe!\" Hearing Lin Xiao's reminder, Chen Hui and the other were surprised. Although they were investigating together, Chen Hui and the other hadn't found the fire axe.\n\n\"Hehehe, hehehe.\" Just as Chen Hui and the other were marveling at Lin Xiao's terrifying observational skills, the same eerie laughter echoed again.\n\nThe moment he heard the strange laughter, Chen Hui immediately hugged Lu Qianxing tightly.\n\n\"The sound is coming from upstairs,\" Lin Xiao stopped his work and looked up towards the upper floors of the mall.\n\n\"Should we go up and check?\" Lu Qianxing first looked up at the mall's upper floors, then turned his gaze to Lin Xiao.\n\nBefore Lin Xiao could speak, Chen Hui, who was clinging to Lu Qianxing, spoke first, \"No need, I think it's safer to stay here.\"\n\n\"Let's go check. Perhaps the other party has been waiting for us for a long time,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, then started walking up the mall stairs.\n\nSeeing this, Lu Qianxing didn't say anything more. He dragged Chen Hui and followed Lin Xiao.\n\nAfter the three of them went up to the second floor of the mall, they began to investigate. However, after a thorough inspection of the second floor, Chen Hui and the other found nothing.\n\n\"Are we still going up? I have a bad feeling,\" Chen Hui's gaze was fixed on the stairs leading to the third floor. For some reason, he felt extremely uneasy at this moment.\n\nLin Xiao and Lu Qianxing did not answer Chen Hui's words. Both of them were looking at the stairs leading to the third floor.\n\n\"What's wrong? Did you find anything?\" Seeing that Lu Qianxing's gaze was constantly fixed on the stairs to the third floor, Lin Xiao guessed that Lu Qianxing might have sensed something.\n\nLu Qianxing's face was grim, and his gaze remained fixed on the stairs to the third floor. After a long pause, Lu Qianxing spoke in a deep voice, \"There is something terrifying on the third floor. My advice is not to go up further.\"\n\n\"We have talismans. Are the talismans also useless?\" Lin Xiao asked, taking out the talismans he had previously imagined.\n\nLu Qianxing shook his head slightly. \"After all, this is a dream, and the talismans are just imagined things. I don't know if they are useful.\" Although Lin Xiao had successfully imagined the talismans, Lu Qianxing couldn't be sure if they had any effect.\n\n\"I think we shouldn't go up. If the talismans are useless, it will be troublesome.\" At this moment, Chen Hui was extremely frightened and strongly resisted going up to the third floor of the mall.\n\n\"You two wait for me here. I'll go investigate. Besides, the fire axe is on the third floor. If we want to leave here, we have to get the fire axe,\" even though Lu Qianxing had warned Lin Xiao of the danger, Lin Xiao still decided to go up to the third floor to investigate.\n\n\"It's too dangerous to go alone. Moreover, if we get separated again, anything could happen,\" Lu Qianxing advised Lin Xiao, not wanting him to take the risk.\n\n\"Even if we don't go up, won't the other party come down?\" Lin Xiao said coldly. He believed that they had no choice in their current situation, and everything was under the other party's control.\n\n\"That's true, but...\" Chen Hui wanted to retort, but words failed him. He also knew that the current situation was just as Lin Xiao said; they didn't have the initiative. Even if he hid, he might not be able to escape.\n\nAs soon as Chen Hui finished speaking, Lin Xiao strode towards the third floor of the mall. Seeing Lin Xiao's resolute decision, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui could only sigh helplessly and finally chose to follow.\n\nUpon reaching the third floor of the mall, it was no different from when they had checked it before. Everything around them remained unchanged.\n\n\"From downstairs, I could faintly sense something terrifying on the upper floor, but after coming up, that feeling disappeared,\" Lu Qianxing frowned. He had sensed something terrifying on the upper floor downstairs, but after coming up, all the feelings disappeared. Lu Qianxing couldn't even sense any abnormality on the third floor.\n\n\"Could it be that the other party knows we're coming up and has gone to the top floor?\" The mall had a total of four floors. According to Chen Hui's guess, if the terrifying thing Lu Qianxing mentioned wasn't on the third floor, it must be on the fourth floor.\n\n\"Let's get the fire axe first, and then head to the fourth floor,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, then walked towards the fire escape on the east side of the third floor.\n\nFollowing Lin Xiao to the fire escape on the east side of the third floor, the three of them did not find the fire axe Lin Xiao had mentioned. Instead, they found a fire extinguisher, and it had been used.\n\n\"There's no fire axe, Detective Lin. Are you mistaken? Isn't it on the third floor?\" Chen Hui's eyes darted around, searching for the fire axe Lin Xiao had mentioned. But all he found was a used fire extinguisher.\n\n\"I won't be mistaken. The fire axe was right here before,\" Lin Xiao said with absolute confidence in his memory.\n\n\"Could the axe have grown legs and run away? Or perhaps that little girl took the axe?\" Chen Hui said with a helpless, joking tone.\n\n\"Careful!\" As soon as Chen Hui finished speaking, Lu Qianxing suddenly grabbed Lin Xiao and pulled him back. In the next instant, just one centimeter away from Lin Xiao's nose, a sharp fire axe fell straight down from above, smashing onto the ground in front of Lin Xiao.\n\nThe moment the fire axe hit the ground, Lin Xiao quickly looked up. In the stairwell leading to the fourth floor, Lin Xiao saw a small figure flash by.\n\nLin Xiao picked up the fire axe from the ground without thinking and headed directly to the fourth floor. Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui had not yet recovered from the shock, but seeing Lin Xiao heading to the fourth floor, they quickly followed.\n\n\"That was close! How did that axe suddenly fall from above?\" Chen Hui gasped, still shaken by the dangerous scene.\n\n\"The little girl is on the fourth floor,\" Lu Qianxing said in a deep voice. The moment the fire axe fell, he had also seen a small figure flash by in the stairwell of the fourth floor.\n\nAfter rushing to the fourth floor, the three of them saw no one. They only heard an eerie voice echoing from a distance.\n\n\"Hehehe, let's play together. You have to play hide-and-seek with me. If you lose, you'll disappear forever.\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 195: Game Rules\n\nAs Chen Hui and the other two rushed to the fourth floor of the mall, a little girl in a black dress stood not far from them, giving them a very eerie smile.\n\n\"Are you ready? The game is about to begin. If you lose, you'll disappear forever,\" the little girl said in a childish voice. As soon as she finished speaking, Chen Hui and the other two's vision instantly went black. When they woke up again, they were no longer in the mall but had arrived at a school.\n\nChen Hui got up from the ground, holding his head and looking in pain. \"Damn it! My head really hurts!\"\n\n\"Brother Hui, you're finally awake.\" Lu Qianxing looked at Chen Hui with a worried expression. Seeing Chen Hui awake and safe, Lu Qianxing breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Where is this? Did we leave the mall?\" Chen Hui held his head and looked around, realizing he was no longer in the mall but in an unknown place.\n\n\"It should be the school's teaching building,\" Lu Qianxing replied, answering Chen Hui's question.\n\nHearing Lu Qianxing's answer, Chen Hui was stunned. \"Teaching building? What do you mean? Did we leave the mall? How did we end up in a school?\" Chen Hui was completely confused, unable to understand what was happening.\n\n\"I'm not sure either, because I only woke up not long ago. When I woke up, we were already here.\" Lu Qianxing gave Chen Hui an awkward smile.\n\n\"Where's Detective Lin? Why don't I see Detective Lin?\" Chen Hui looked around and, not seeing Lin Xiao, immediately became worried about Lin Xiao's safety.\n\n\"Brother Hui, don't worry. Detective Lin went to investigate this teaching building and should be back soon,\" Lu Qianxing quickly replied, answering Chen Hui's question.\n\n\"Investigate the teaching building? Didn't you say earlier that it would be dangerous if we split up? Why did you let Detective Lin go investigate alone!\" Lu Qianxing had previously said that the three of them should not split up and must act together, but now, Lu Qianxing had let Lin Xiao investigate alone, which confused Chen Hui.\n\n\"Detective Lin said it's fine because we've entered that little girl's game.\" Lu Qianxing relayed Lin Xiao's answer to Chen Hui verbatim.\n\n\"The little girl's game?\" Chen Hui frowned, recalling memories. \"That's right, I seem to remember that little girl saying something about playing hide-and-seek, and then my vision went black.\"\n\n\"Yes, Detective Lin said we've entered the little girl's game. He also said that if we lose, we might be trapped here forever and never be able to leave.\"\n\n\"Qianxing, this is just a dream. Can they really trap us here forever?\"\n\n\"As long as the other party traps our consciousness here, even if we wake up in reality, we'll just be in a vegetative state.\" Before Lu Qianxing could answer, Lin Xiao, who had finished investigating the teaching building, returned.\n\n\"Detective Lin!\" Seeing Lin Xiao safe and sound, Chen Hui felt a sense of relief and completely let go of his worries.\n\n\"You're awake? How are you? Are you alright?\" Lin Xiao spoke calmly. Although his words were cold, Chen Hui felt a warmth from them.\n\nChen Hui quickly shook his head and smiled at Lin Xiao. \"I'm fine, I just woke up and feel a bit dizzy. I'll be fine after resting for a while.\"\n\n\"Mhm.\" Lin Xiao nodded, then began to tell Chen Hui and the other person about his investigation. \"The teaching building we're in has six floors. The first to fourth floors are all classrooms, the fifth floor is an activity room with a library, a drawing room, and other activity rooms, and the sixth floor is the teachers' offices.\" Lin Xiao had investigated every floor of the teaching building in detail.\n\n\"Can't we get out of the teaching building?\" Hearing that Lin Xiao had only investigated the interior of the teaching building and not the exterior, Chen Hui guessed that the teaching building, like the mall before, was sealed off.\n\n\"The teaching building has six exits: one on the east side and one on the west side, followed by the main entrance and the back door. Finally, there are two small doors on either side of the main entrance. However, all six exits are sealed with chains and cannot be opened,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, answering Chen Hui's question.\n\n\"What about the windows in the classrooms on the first floor? Can we leave from there?\" Lu Qianxing thought that perhaps they could leave from the windows of the first-floor classrooms.\n\n\"The windows of all classrooms on floors one to four, including the restrooms and washrooms on each floor, are all nailed shut with wooden boards. Even if the boards are removed, the windows are still sealed with chains.\" Lin Xiao's investigation was very thorough. After removing a wooden board, he discovered that there were chains outside the board.\n\n\"Which floor are we on?\" Chen Hui looked towards the window not far away. Although the window was not covered by wooden boards, Chen Hui could still see nothing through it.\n\n\"Sixth-floor corridor.\"\n\n\"It's pitch black outside, and I can't see anything. Is there any way to open the window? Maybe we can find out where we're trapped.\" Chen Hui checked the window and found it locked and unable to open.\n\n\"Opening the window is useless. There's nothing but an abyss that you can't see the bottom of.\" Clearly, Lin Xiao had already opened the window to check.\n\n\"An abyss!\" Chen Hui was very surprised by Lin Xiao's answer.\n\n\"Detective Lin, any other findings?\" Lu Qianxing pressed, feeling that things weren't that simple and that the little girl wouldn't just move the three of them from the mall and trap them in another place.\n\n\"There's a screen hanging in the lobby on the first floor, and the game rules are written on it.\"\n\n\"Game rules!\" Hearing Lin Xiao's words, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing were both stunned.\n\n\"Hide-and-seek. Every half hour, a 'ghost' will appear in the teaching building. If you get caught by the ghost, you lose. If you lose, you become the 'ghost' and will be trapped here forever.\"\n\n\"'Ghost,' 'ghost'...\" When Lin Xiao mentioned the ghost, Chen Hui shivered instantly, and various terrifying images flashed through his mind.\n\n\"When does the hide-and-seek start?\" Lin Xiao didn't mention the start time of the hide-and-seek, so Lu Qianxing asked the question.\n\n\"The game started when we woke up,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, his face showing no expression. At this moment, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing's faces instantly fell.\n\n\"N-no way it's that soon!\" Chen Hui gave a wry smile, a trace of fear crossing his face.\n\n\"Ring ring ring!\"\n\nSuddenly, the school bell rang, and in the next instant, a chilling laughter echoed throughout the entire teaching building.\n\n\"Hehehe, hehehe...\"\n\n\"Let's find a place to hide first. If we get caught, we lose.\" At this moment, Lin Xiao's expression was still very calm. Facing the current situation, Lin Xiao seemed not to be afraid at all.\n\nIn contrast, among Chen Hui and the other two, Lu Qianxing's expression was solemn, while Chen Hui tightly held Lu Qianxing's arm. Before even seeing the \"ghost,\" Chen Hui was already scared out of his wits.\n\n(End of chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 196: The Game Begins\n\n\"Thump! Thump! Thump!\"\n\nHeavy footsteps suddenly echoed through the teaching building, and then, a figure dressed in white mourning clothes, carrying a mourning stick, appeared in the lobby.\n\nHopping up the stairs of the teaching building, the figure in mourning clothes moved, patrolling the entire building.\n\n\"Qianxing, if we hide here, won't we be discovered?\" Chen Hui and his group were hiding under the lectern in one of the classrooms.\n\n\"We probably won't be. Judging by the footsteps, the other party should be upstairs. Moreover, according to the game rules, as long as we hide for 15 minutes without being discovered, the 'ghost' will disappear. The next time the 'ghost' appears will be 15 minutes later.\" Lu Qianxing made this judgment while calculating the time it would take for the \"ghost\" outside to patrol the first floor.\n\nFifteen minutes might not seem like a long time, but for Chen Hui and his companions, it felt like fifteen years.\n\n\"The 'ghost' is gone! Where should we hide this time? Should we still hide under the lectern?\" After emerging from under the lectern, Lu Qianxing asked Lin Xiao.\n\nLin Xiao did not answer Lu Qianxing's question but fell into deep thought. After a long while, Lin Xiao slowly said, \"Follow me.\"\n\nFollowing Lin Xiao, Lu Qianxing and the other two hid in the computer room on the fifth floor of the teaching building.\n\n\"Detective Lin, is there a reason for hiding here?\" Upon arriving at the computer room, Lu Qianxing found that there were not many computers, and it looked quite spacious, not ideal for hiding.\n\n\"Yeah! The dance studio before had a large wardrobe. Hiding there should be safer!\" As they passed the dance studio, Chen Hui noticed a very large wardrobe that could comfortably fit the three of them.\n\n\"The 'ghost' has already patrolled here. Therefore, the probability of it patrolling here again is very small. Conversely, the dance studio was not patrolled by the 'ghost', so the probability of it being patrolled is much higher,\" Lin Xiao calmly explained his reason for choosing the computer room.\n\n\"It patrolled here? How did you know, Detective Lin!\" Hearing Lin Xiao's answer, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui were both stunned. They couldn't understand how Lin Xiao knew the 'ghost' had patrolled the computer room. After all, the three of them had been hiding under the lectern on the third floor, so logically, Lin Xiao shouldn't have known which rooms the 'ghost' had patrolled.\n\n\"The door to the computer room shows signs of being pushed open,\" Lin Xiao continued to answer their questions calmly.\n\n\"Signs of being pushed open?\" Hearing Lin Xiao's reply, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui checked the door of the computer room but found nothing.\n\n\"How did you figure that out? It doesn't look particularly special,\" Chen Hui was puzzled as to how Lin Xiao had made his judgment.\n\n\"When I investigated the teaching building earlier, I opened all the doors to every room by a span's distance. However, the door to the computer room was opened less than a span's distance, so I can confirm that this place has been patrolled by the 'ghost'.\"\n\nAfter hearing Lin Xiao's explanation, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui both looked at him with admiration. They hadn't expected Lin Xiao to have already prepared for this.\n\n\"Ring!\"\n\nThe bell rang, signaling that 15 minutes had passed. Chen Hui quickly ducked behind a computer desk.\n\n\"Thump, thump... thump.\"\n\n\"The footsteps have changed. It's not the same 'ghost' as before.\" Hearing the change in the footsteps outside, Chen Hui made his judgment.\n\nJust as Chen Hui made his judgment, the previous heavy footsteps echoed again.\n\n\"Thump! Thump! Thump!\"\n\n\"What's going on!\" Hearing the heavy footsteps again, Chen Hui was stunned and felt confused.\n\n\"Two different sounds. Could it be that another 'ghost' has appeared along with the previous one?\" Lu Qianxing frowned and guessed.\n\n\"Does that mean the number of 'ghosts' will increase every half hour! If so, aren't we definitely going to be caught!\" Hearing Lu Qianxing's guess, Chen Hui shivered.\n\n\"The game starts exactly at midnight. If I'm not mistaken, the game will end at 6 AM tomorrow morning,\" Lin Xiao suddenly spoke up, explaining to the two of them.\n\n\"Midnight? 6 AM? How do you know, Detective Lin?\"\n\n\"The game's name is written in the rules, 'Midnight Hide-and-Seek', so I guessed that the game should start at midnight. As for ending at 6 AM the next morning, it's because there's a sentence at the end of the game rules.\"\n\n\"'Everything will end when the sun rises.'\"\n\n\"'When the sun rises'? But the sun might rise around 5 AM!\" Chen Hui raised a question.\n\n\"In the classroom we were in before, the textbooks were from the first semester of the third grade. Judging by the wear and tear on the books, they've been around for about 4 months. Since they are from the first semester of the third grade, and school starts in September, counting back four months from the first semester puts us in December. December is winter, so the sun would naturally rise around 6 AM.\"\n\nAfter hearing Lin Xiao's judgment, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui were left speechless. They didn't know what to say, and only admiration for Lin Xiao remained in their hearts.\n\n\"Detective Lin! I'm impressed!\" Lu Qianxing gave Lin Xiao a thumbs-up, and Chen Hui followed suit.\n\n\"What I've said is just a conjecture, not an accurate answer. Nothing is certain yet,\" Lin Xiao replied calmly to their praise, his face expressionless.\n\nSoon, another 15 minutes passed, and the three successfully hid again. After surviving, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui immediately turned their attention to Lin Xiao, ready to follow his commands.\n\nLin Xiao said nothing but walked out of the computer room. Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui followed closely.\n\nAfter leaving the computer room, Lin Xiao led them up to the sixth floor of the teaching building. When they reached an office on the sixth floor, Lin Xiao instructed them to enter.\n\n\"Detective Lin? Was this room just patrolled?\" As Lin Xiao told them to enter, he observed the distance the door was opened, which was less than the span Lin Xiao had mentioned.\n\n\"This place has not been patrolled,\" Lin Xiao stated calmly.\n\n\"Huh?\" Hearing Lin Xiao's answer, Chen Hui was stunned. \"That's not right, Detective Lin. I saw earlier that the door was opened less than a span. According to what you said, this place should have been patrolled.\"\n\n\"Didn't you notice that all the doors on the entire sixth floor were opened less than a span?\"\n\n\"That means the entire sixth floor has been searched,\" Lu Qianxing said, following Lin Xiao's line of thought.\n\n\"No, the three 'ghosts' did not appear on the sixth floor just now. Judging by the time it took for the 'ghost' to search a room previously, they wouldn't have had enough time to search all the rooms on the sixth floor,\" Chen Hui made this judgment because he had closed his eyes and listened to the 'ghost's' movements, so he was clear about the time it took to search one room. Furthermore, he hadn't heard the three 'ghosts' come upstairs, so he concluded that it was impossible for all the rooms on the sixth floor to have been searched.\n\n\"Then? Could it be that they know our thoughts!\" After hearing Chen Hui's explanation, Lu Qianxing's heart was filled with a terrible thought.\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 197: The Gamble!\n\nTime ticked by, and following Lin Xiao, Chen Hui and the other managed to evade the \"ghosts'\" searches time and time again. However, when the seventh \"ghost\" appeared, Lin Xiao and the two hiding with him heard a large number of \"ghosts\" outside the teaching building.\n\n\"The number of 'ghosts' is increasing. If this continues, we'll be found sooner or later.\" Hearing the footsteps outside, Chen Hui's worry grew more severe.\n\n\"Detective Lin, if what you said is true, and the game ends at 6 o'clock, the last round will have 78 'ghosts'. Can we still hide with such numbers?\" Lu Qianxing looked at Lin Xiao with a wry smile. Facing the current situation, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui could only place all their bets on Lin Xiao.\n\nLin Xiao did not answer Lu Qianxing's question, instead falling into thought.\n\n\"Let alone the last round, I don't think we can even make it to the last round,\" Chen Hui sighed, speaking with a look of helplessness.\n\nAnother 15 minutes passed safely. Chen Hui and the two evaded another round, but facing the next one, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing were gradually losing confidence. They felt that no matter how capable Lin Xiao was, he couldn't keep evading forever, especially since the number of \"ghosts\" increased as time went on.\n\n\"Detective Lin, where should we hide this time?\" Chen Hui habitually asked Lin Xiao, having completely lost the ability to think for himself.\n\n\"The teaching building lobby,\" Lin Xiao replied calmly.\n\n\"The teaching building lobby?!\" Hearing Lin Xiao's answer, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui were both stunned. They both thought they had misheard. After all, the teaching building lobby was very spacious with no place to hide.\n\n\"Detective Lin, are we going to hide on the first floor? There shouldn't be any hiding spots in the teaching building lobby!\" Chen Hui asked, confused.\n\n\"Yeah! How can we hide in such a spacious lobby?\" Lu Qianxing also said with a wry smile, completely puzzled about what Lin Xiao meant by hiding in the teaching building lobby.\n\nLin Xiao did not answer their questions and walked directly towards the first-floor lobby of the teaching building.\n\n\"Detective Lin!\" Seeing Lin Xiao walking towards the first-floor lobby, Chen Hui and the two, despite their doubts, could only choose to trust Lin Xiao at this moment.\n\n\"Ring ring!\"\n\nThe eighth bell rang. This time, Chen Hui and his companions did not hide. The three of them simply stood in the center of the first-floor lobby of the teaching building.\n\n\"We're done for, we're done for! With so many 'ghosts', we're dead this time.\" Listening to the dense footsteps, Chen Hui hid behind Lu Qianxing and Lin Xiao, muttering to himself, his heart completely conquered by fear.\n\n\"Detective Lin, may I ask if there's a reason why we're standing here?\" About five minutes had passed, but Chen Hui and the two, who were boldly standing in the center of the lobby, had not been caught by the \"ghosts.\" So, Lu Qianxing wondered if Lin Xiao had a reason for having them stand in the lobby.\n\nLin Xiao did not answer Lu Qianxing's question immediately. Instead, he scanned the surroundings of the lobby. After a long while, Lin Xiao slowly spoke.\n\n\"During the previous seven evades, I've been testing how the other party knows our thoughts. After seven tests, I have a rough idea. The other party cannot know our thoughts immediately. They can only know our thoughts after we've completed a game, and then control the 'ghosts'' actions in the next round.\"\n\n\"What do you mean!\" After listening to Lin Xiao's explanation, Lu Qianxing and Chen Hui looked bewildered. Neither of them understood Lin Xiao's explanation.\n\n\"Simply put, in one sentence, the other party can know our thoughts, but not in real-time. Our thought to hide in the lobby this time will be known by the other party after this game ends, and they will prepare accordingly before the next game.\" Lin Xiao explained as concisely as possible to Chen Hui and the two.\n\nWith the second explanation, Chen Hui and the two began to understand Lin Xiao's meaning. \"Detective Lin means that the other party will determine our next hiding spot based on our hiding strategy from the previous round?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Lin Xiao nodded.\n\n\"If that's the case, then how did we evade the previous seven times!\" Thinking about how the three of them had safely evaded seven times, Chen Hui felt it was somewhat unbelievable. After all, the other party should know their thoughts. Even if they couldn't know immediately, they should be able to guess a little about their next hiding place.\n\n\"Detective Lin, aren't you intentionally misleading the other party's thoughts for us to evade these past seven times?\" Thinking of the tests Lin Xiao mentioned earlier, Lu Qianxing wondered if Lin Xiao had been feeding the other party incorrect information all along, thus preventing them from finding them.\n\n\"The teaching building is not large. With the increasing number of 'ghosts,' even with my misdirection, we would eventually be unable to escape within 15 minutes. This time is our last chance. Next time, we will have nowhere to hide,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, but it caused huge ripples in the hearts of Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing.\n\n\"Detective Lin, so you were luring the other party for the past seven rounds!\" Chen Hui originally thought they were always on the defensive, but he never imagined that they had actually been on the offensive all along, and the other party was the one truly on the defensive.\n\nLu Qianxing stared intently at Lin Xiao beside him, unable to evaluate Lin Xiao for a moment. After a long pause, Lu Qianxing slowly spoke.\n\n\"Detective Lin, I suddenly feel so lucky! If you were a 'ghost,' I'm afraid we would have been utterly finished long ago.\"\n\n\"Detective Lin, after evading this time, what about next time? Is there really nowhere left to hide?\" After listening to Lin Xiao's explanation, Chen Hui was no longer worried about being caught by the \"ghosts\" this time, but was concerned about the next round. After all, as Lin Xiao said, next time, they would have nowhere to hide and would be doomed.\n\nLin Xiao did not answer Chen Hui's question, his gaze fixed forward, continuing to ponder.\n\nAnother 15 minutes passed, and Chen Hui and the two successfully evaded again. However, for the next 15 minutes, even Lin Xiao was unsure if they could successfully evade.\n\n\"Detective Lin, what do we do next? Is there really nowhere left to hide?\"\n\n\"No,\" Lin Xiao replied very concisely.\n\nHearing Lin Xiao's blunt answer, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing were instantly filled with despair, which welled up from the depths of their hearts.\n\n\"We have one last chance, one gamble. If it succeeds, we can evade the next round, but if it fails, everything will be over.\"\n\n\"What chance!\" As soon as Lin Xiao finished speaking, Chen Hui and the two climbed out of the abyss of despair. Regardless, since Lin Xiao said there was still a chance, they could see the existence of hope.\n\n\"Gamble!\"\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 198: The Last Chance\n\n\"Ten, nine, eight, three, two, one. Start!\" Facing the countless \"ghosts\" searching within the teaching building, Chen Hui and the other two rushed out of a classroom on the third floor. Then, with the fastest speed possible, they dashed into the classroom next door. Just as the two entered the adjacent classroom, \"ghosts\" entered the classroom they had just vacated.\n\n\"Huff! Huff! Huff!\" Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing panted heavily, their expressions grave, their faces showing the relief of narrowly escaping death.\n\n\"Detective Lin, what now? What do we do? Continue hiding here?\" Chen Hui asked Lin Xiao anxiously. He really didn't want to experience the feeling of \"narrowly escaping death\" again.\n\nLin Xiao did not answer Chen Hui's question but instead murmured, as if calculating something. After a moment, Lin Xiao slowly spoke, \"In one minute, exactly like before, run to the art studio on the fifth floor as fast as you can.\"\n\n\"Fifth? The fifth floor! Detective Lin, we're on the third floor! And the stairs are still some distance away. No matter how fast we run, with so many 'ghosts' outside, how can we avoid them!\" Lu Qianxing gave a wry smile, looking at Lin Xiao helplessly.\n\n\"If my calculations are correct, there are no 'ghosts' between our current location and the stairwell. By the time we rush to the stairs and then from the third to the fourth floor, the 'ghosts' on the fourth floor should be entering one of the classrooms to investigate. And when we get to the fifth floor, a 'ghost' will also be just leaving the art studio. In this brief window, if we succeed, we will have avoided this time.\" Lin Xiao's voice remained calm, showing no fear despite their current predicament.\n\n\"Is this the gamble you mentioned earlier, Detective Lin?\" After listening to Lin Xiao's explanation, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing finally understood what Lin Xiao's earlier mention of \"gambling\" was about.\n\n\"There's no time to waste. The 'ghosts' in the next room will be out soon. If we don't leave now, we won't even have a chance to gamble,\" Lin Xiao said calmly, as if whatever was about to happen had nothing to do with him.\n\nHearing this, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing gritted their teeth and made a decision. \"Detective Lin! We'll follow your orders!\"\n\n\"Ten, nine, eight, three, two, one. Start!\"\n\nThe countdown ended, and the three of them left the classroom they were in and headed straight for the stairwell on the third floor. Then, using the stairs on the third floor, they rushed to the fourth floor. Just as they reached the fourth floor, Chen Hui and the other saw a \"ghost\" entering a classroom to investigate, just as Lin Xiao had said.\n\nAfter reaching the fourth floor, the three did not stop and rushed to the fifth floor with all their might. When they reached the fifth floor, Chen Hui and the other saw the back of a \"ghost.\" As Lin Xiao had said, the \"ghost\" had just walked out of the art studio.\n\nThe moment the \"ghost\" that had come out of the art studio turned to enter another activity room to investigate, Chen Hui and the other two entered the art studio almost at the same time, successfully evading the \"ghost's\" investigation.\n\n\"Huff! Huff! Huff!\" After entering the art studio, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing were panting even harder than before.\n\n\"My god! I almost, just barely, saw the 'ghost's' face! I was scared to death!\" Chen Hui shivered all over, recalling the scene just now, his heart unable to calm down.\n\n\"Detective Lin, this time, we've made it through, right!\" Although Lu Qianxing wasn't afraid of \"ghosts,\" this time, a shadow had formed in his heart. He didn't dare to look at the \"ghost\" and was very scared of it.\n\n\"Mm. The gamble was won, but next time, we might not even have a chance to gamble.\" Lin Xiao's words were still calm, as if no matter what happened, his words would not change.\n\n\"Not even a chance to gamble? Then this game, isn't there no possibility for us to win at all?\" Chen Hui snorted, feeling a bit angry. A game that couldn't be won, Chen Hui felt was simply a manipulation by the other party.\n\n\"There are only three more chances. It seems we really won't even last until the last one!\" Lu Qianxing let out a long sigh and slumped to the ground, a look of despair crossing his face. Facing an unchangeable outcome, all efforts were futile.\n\n\"If you want to kill or torture, at least give us a quick end! Although I admit I'm afraid of dying! But to toy with us like this! It's too cruel!\" Chen Hui gritted his teeth, filled with anger but also helplessness.\n\n\"I remember when I was little, I always heard my mother say that a person's life is predetermined from birth. It seems that's true now. Faced with the twists of fate, all we can do is futilely resist,\" Lu Qianxing said, a self-mocking smile crossing his face, then speaking somewhat sadly.\n\n\"Detective Lin, I've never seen you smile. What does it look like when you smile?\" Amidst Lu Qianxing's sadness, Chen Hui's next sentence perfectly broke the somber atmosphere.\n\n\"...\" Lu Qianxing looked at Chen Hui, his helplessness turning into resignation.\n\n\"Smile? If someone said that from the day they were born, they couldn't smile, would you believe it?\" Lin Xiao said faintly, his gaze turning to Chen Hui and the other.\n\n\"Born unable to smile? Are there people like that?\" Chen Hui murmured, as if asking Lin Xiao, or perhaps asking himself. \"There probably are. After all, the world is vast and full of wonders.\"\n\n\"I've heard of people who can't cry, but I don't recall ever hearing of someone who can't smile,\" Lu Qianxing said thoughtfully after hearing Lin Xiao's question.\n\n\"There's nothing impossible in this world. Just like fate, passively accepting it is one outcome, but fighting against fate and trying to change it is another. Even if the final outcome appears unchanged, in reality, in the process of changing fate, we ourselves have changed. Therefore, the final outcome is naturally not the initial outcome.\"\n\n\"People who are born unable to smile and people who are born unable to cry, on the surface, they are already slaves to fate. But in reality, if someone who cannot smile encounters something that makes them laugh enough, even if their face doesn't show a smile, their heart has already laughed. Similarly, someone who cannot cry when they encounter something sad enough to make them weep, even if their face doesn't shed tears, their heart has already cried.\"\n\n\"...\" Upon hearing Lin Xiao's words, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing both fell into thought, Lin Xiao's words echoing in their minds.\n\n\"Don't let so-called fate bind the last chance in your heart. If fate is predetermined from birth, then before fate becomes the outcome, give it your all. Even if you lose, the worst that can happen is returning to the previous outcome; but if you succeed and break the shackles of fate, everything will change.\"\n\n(End of this chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 199: The One Who Doesn't Believe in Fate\n\n\"Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Ready.\"\n\n\"Start.\"\n\nAt Lin Xiao's command, Chen Hui and the other two rushed out of the classroom they were currently in at top speed. They then ducked into the adjacent classroom. After less than a minute in the adjacent classroom, the three of them rushed out again, entering another classroom.\n\nThis repeated, and within about five minutes, Chen Hui and the other two had gone through several classrooms, arriving at the last classroom near the end of the stairs. After spending about two minutes in the last classroom, they rushed out of the classroom once more, heading directly for the stairwell. They ascended the stairs to the top floor of the teaching building. Then, after evading two patrolling \"ghosts,\" they entered the principal's office.\n\n\"Detective Lin, how much more time do we have?\"\n\n\"Six and a half minutes.\"\n\n\"Only half the time has passed?\" Although only half the time had passed, during this period, the three of them had faced perilous situations, narrowly escaping death each time. A slight misstep would have meant disappearing forever.\n\n\"Detective Lin, what are our chances of winning this gamble now?\"\n\n\"Less than half.\" Lin Xiao's voice remained calm, but upon hearing Lin Xiao's answer, Chen Hui and the other's faces instantly turned grim.\n\n\"Still less than half? Could it be? We have no chance of winning?\" Lu Qianxing gritted his teeth and spoke. They had tried their best, but no matter how hard they tried, the outcome seemed to be heading towards the worst possible scenario.\n\n\"It seems we still can't escape the shackles of fate! From beginning to end, this is a game that's destined to be lost!\" By this point, Chen Hui was drenched in sweat, partly from exhaustion and partly from fear.\n\n\"Three, two, one, go!\" Before Chen Hui and the other could snap back to attention, Lin Xiao commanded again. Chen Hui and the other followed Lin Xiao closely, skirting around two \"ghosts\" before arriving at another classroom not far from the principal's office. After entering the classroom, Lin Xiao glanced at the two of them and then spoke coldly.\n\n\"Although I've calculated countless times, even with our speed, in the next evasion, we will be seen by the 'ghost' in the adjacent classroom.\"\n\n\"Is this the end?\" Lu Qianxing's brow furrowed slightly, and he let out a sigh of helplessness.\n\n\"Detective Lin, didn't you say we still had less than half a chance of winning? But from what you're saying now, it seems there's no chance at all.\" Having come this far, Chen Hui felt a sense of unwillingness and wanted to try again.\n\n\"The moment we just dodged those two 'ghosts,' that less than half chance disappeared,\" Lin Xiao said calmly.\n\nChen Hui and Lu Qianxing heard Lin Xiao's answer, and a flicker of confusion crossed their faces. \"What do you mean? Why?\"\n\n\"Didn't you notice that the 'ghosts' seem to have gotten faster? According to my initial calculations, we indeed had less than half a chance to perfectly evade the 'ghosts' at the 15-minute mark. But just now, I realized that the 'ghosts' have sped up. Although it's only a little, it's just enough that we'll be caught by the 'ghosts' before the game time is up, which would mean the game is over.\"\n\n\"Why is this happening!\" Despair flickered across Lu Qianxing's face. He couldn't understand why hope would be shattered at the last moment.\n\n\"From the beginning, did they never intend for us to win? So, this game, from the start, was a one-sided deception by the other side; we never had a chance to win,\" Chen Hui gritted his teeth, feeling immense indignation. He felt as if the three of them had been mere playthings for the other side to toy with from the very beginning.\n\n\"Time is running out, let's go.\" Calculating the time, Lin Xiao urged Chen Hui and the other to move again.\n\n\"Go? Go where? In the end, do we still have to be fooled one last time? Are you really willing to be a toy in someone else's eyes!\" Chen Hui gritted his teeth. The unwillingness surged in his heart, but along with it came a sense of powerlessness. Even if he struggled desperately, he couldn't break free from the predetermined ending, and everything was in vain.\n\n\"Detective Lin, do we really have no chance at all?\" Under Lin Xiao's guidance, although the three of them had faced constant danger, they had miraculously made it through safely. Therefore, at this final juncture, Lu Qianxing still held a glimmer of hope, wishing Lin Xiao could create a miracle again. \"Detective Lin, will there really be no miracle?\"\n\n\"There are no miracles in this world. We've reached this point solely through my calculations. The 'ghosts'' movement patterns are fixed, which is why we've been able to come this far.\" Lin Xiao said coldly. Regarding their miraculous survival of various perilous situations, Lin Xiao attributed it to calculation, stating it had nothing to do with miracles.\n\n\"There are no miracles in this world?\"\n\n\"If my calculations had been even slightly off, we would have already lost. What you call miracles are merely your own perceptions. In my perception, we've reached this point simply because we made the most correct choices.\" Lin Xiao stated calmly, answering Lu Qianxing's question. After speaking, he urged the two again, \"There are twenty seconds left. Do you want to sit here and wait for death, or do you want to 'gamble' again? It's up to you.\" With that, Lin Xiao began the countdown.\n\n\"Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, five, four, three, two, one.\" At the exact moment the countdown ended, Lin Xiao ignored Chen Hui and the other, pushed open the door, and left directly.\n\nAnd at the moment Lin Xiao's countdown ended, Chen Hui and Lu Qianxing did not hesitate. They didn't know why, but after deciding to give up, at the last second of the countdown, they both took action and followed Lin Xiao's footsteps.\n\n\"Still unwilling to admit defeat!\" As they caught up with Lin Xiao, Chen Hui shook his head and murmured.\n\nBeside him, Lu Qianxing's gaze, which had been filled with despair at the last moment, suddenly became resolute.\n\nEverything happened as Lin Xiao had said. With less than two seconds left before the end, they were discovered. Then, a \"ghost\" that happened to see them pounced, leaping towards the three of them.\n\nChen Hui closed his eyes tightly, choosing to find peace in the final moment. Lu Qianxing stared intently at the pouncing \"ghost,\" choosing to face it. Only Lin Xiao's gaze was indifferent, his expression still calm, as if nothing that happened had anything to do with him.\n\n\"If a person is willing to believe in fate, then from the very beginning, they have already lost.\"\n\nLin Xiao's words echoed in Chen Hui and the other's ears. The next moment, Lin Xiao suddenly took a step forward and then lunged fiercely, tightly embracing the \"ghost\" that was lunging at them.\n\n\"Three, two, one. Your paths are still long. Don't let fate shackle your steps.\"\n\n\"Detective Lin!\" Lu Qianxing had not yet recovered from seeing this. But the next second, Lin Xiao disappeared along with the \"ghost.\" Since Chen Hui had kept his eyes closed, he didn't see that scene. But the moment Chen Hui opened his eyes again, his vision suddenly went black, and then, as before, he lost consciousness again.\n\n(End of Chapter)",

    "content": "Chapter 200: The Other Half\n\n\"Detective Lin Lin!\" Deep in the darkness, Chen Hui saw Lin Xiao's receding back. However, no matter how much Chen Hui called out, that back never turned, slowly disappearing into the darkness.\n\n\"You're awake.\" A familiar voice sounded. The moment Chen Hui opened his eyes, he saw two familiar figures beside him.\n\n\"Bin? Binzi! Lan! Brother Lan! It's you!\" Those two familiar figures were none other than Ye Bin and Zhang Lan, with whom he had been separated earlier.\n\nYe Bin nodded, a hint of worry crossing his face. \"Chen Hui, are you okay? Why did we only see you and Qian Xing? Where did Detective Lin go?\"\n\n\"Detective Lin!\" Hearing Ye Bin's words, Chen Hui was taken aback for a moment, then turned to look beside him. Beside him, there was only Lu Qian Xing's figure, but Lin Xiao was nowhere to be seen. \"Where did Detective Lin Lin go? He? Why isn't he here!\" A hint of confusion crossed Chen Hui's face, as if he himself didn't know why Lin Xiao was gone.\n\nUpon hearing Chen Hui's answer, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan's expressions immediately sank. \"Chen Hui, you don't know where Detective Lin is? Wasn't Detective Lin with you guys?\" Zhang Lan asked Chen Hui with a stern and cold tone.\n\n\"Detective Lin! Detective Lin he!\" Chen Hui muttered, his mind starting to recall. Just as Chen Hui began to recall, his expression suddenly turned grim, and then his eyes filled with intense fear! \"Detective Lin! Detective Lin, it seems he's trapped there! He! He didn't come back!\"\n\n\"Trapped where?\" Seeing Chen Hui's terrified expression, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan both realized that something must have happened.\n\n\"The teaching building! The teaching building!\"\n\n\"The teaching building?\" Ye Bin and Zhang Lan exchanged glances. Neither of them had ever seen any teaching building.\n\n\"It was that little girl! We were trapped in a teaching building, and then that little girl asked us to play hide-and-seek with her. If we lost, we would be trapped there forever! Just as we were about to lose, I closed my eyes, and then I heard Qian Xing calling Detective Lin's name. When I opened my eyes, everything went black, and then I don't remember anything.\" Chen Hui recalled his last memory before losing consciousness, which was hearing Lu Qian Xing shouting Lin Xiao's name.\n\n\"How can you be sure Detective Lin is trapped there?\" According to Chen Hui, he closed his eyes at the last moment and didn't see what happened in the end. So Ye Bin was curious why Chen Hui was so certain that Detective Lin was trapped in the teaching building he mentioned.\n\n\"Although I didn't see it, Qian Xing kept calling Detective Lin's name. Moreover, according to Detective Lin's calculations, we wouldn't have won that game. But now, since Qian Xing and I are not trapped there, it means Detective Lin must have done something, which is why he let us...\" Chen Hui gritted his teeth at the end, a surge of anger rising in his heart.\n\nAlthough Ye Bin and Zhang Lan couldn't clearly understand what had happened from Chen Hui's words, they generally understood that Lin Xiao seemed to have done something to rescue Chen Hui and Lu Qian Xing, but in turn, he was trapped somewhere.\n\n\"Chen Hui, calm down first and narrate to us carefully what happened.\" Ye Bin advised Chen Hui, knowing that if Chen Hui didn't calm down, he wouldn't be able to explain what had happened clearly.\n\n\"That little girl! That little girl appeared! Then she said she wanted us to play hide-and-seek with her, and then she trapped us in a teaching building. Afterwards...\" Chen Hui recounted the events of the three of them being trapped in the teaching building to Ye Bin and the other. By the end, Chen Hui gritted his teeth, blaming himself for his powerlessness.\n\nAfter listening to Chen Hui's account, Ye Bin and Zhang Lan generally understood what the three of them had experienced. \"If that's the case, it should be Detective Lin sacrificing himself to allow you two to escape.\" Ye Bin said with some emotion, not having expected that Lin Xiao, who seemed devoid of emotion, would choose to sacrifice himself at the last moment to save others.\n\n\"Binzi! What should we do now! We have to find a way to save Detective Lin!\" Chen Hui said anxiously, his heart now only focused on how to rescue Lin Xiao.\n\n\"Since Detective Lin is just trapped there, we still have a chance. However, we have a more important matter to attend to right now.\"\n\n\"What's more important than saving someone! Binzi! Detective Lin sacrificed himself for Qian Xing and me. I absolutely cannot leave Detective Lin alone!\"\n\n\"Don't rush, we must save Detective Lin. Not only that, but we also need to find a way to save Uncle Xu. But the most important thing now is that we must leave here, otherwise, everything will be in vain.\" Ye Bin advised Chen Hui.\n\n\"Detective Lin said before that we were trapped in a dream, and everything now is an illusion. However, even so, waking up is still impossible!\" At this moment, Chen Hui felt that even the previous Lin Xiao had no solution. Even if he believed Ye Bin, he didn't think Lin Xiao could wake them all up from the dream.\n\n\"We already know about the dream, and we already have a way to wake up from it.\" Ye Bin said with a very firm gaze, but Chen Hui believed that Ye Bin was just comforting him.\n\n\"Binzi, this dream is not as simple as you think, otherwise, Detective Lin wouldn't have had no solution at all.\" Chen Hui still felt that waking up from the dream was not an easy task at all.\n\n\"Chen Hui, we have already found a way to leave the dream, and we also understand the structure of this dream.\" Ye Bin said, pointing behind Chen Hui. \"If you don't believe me, you can ask Xiao Yi.\"\n\n\"Xiao Yi?\" Chen Hui was startled for a moment, then turned in the direction Ye Bin pointed. The next moment, the instant he saw the figure behind him, Chen Hui's expression froze, and then his whole body began to tremble uncontrollably.\n\n\"She! It's her! Binzi! It. It's her! It's her who trapped us in that place! It's her!\" Chen Hui stammered, backing away as he spoke.\n\nBut when Chen Hui bumped into Ye Bin, Ye Bin supported him and began to explain.\n\n\"Chen Hui, this is Xiao Yi. You don't need to be afraid. She's here to help us. Finding you and Qian Xing is also thanks to Xiao Yi.\"\n\n\"Binzi! What nonsense are you talking about! It's her! It's her who trapped us in that damned place! How could she help us!\" Chen Hui pointed at the figure in front of him and spoke fiercely.\n\n\"Chen Hui, don't be afraid. Xiao Yi really won't harm us. The little girl you're talking about is not Xiao Yi, but Xiao Yi's other half.\" Zhang Lan also spoke, explaining to Chen Hui.\n\n\"Oth. Other half? What do you mean?\"\n\n(End of this chapter)",
