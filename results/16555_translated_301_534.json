    "content": "This person in green was Yan Yin, the Second Prince of the current Ice Moon Empire. He was ruthless and exceptionally talented in the struggle for power and profit. However, he had a weakness: he was lustful, with a particular fetish for virgins. This place, which appeared to be a teahouse, was his frequent haunt. Manager Fu was an old acquaintance who always satisfied him, so he often came here to \"take a stroll.\"\n\nManager Fu smiled mysteriously and said, \"Your Highness, there's one more thing I must remind you of. The two girls today are not just like the previous ones; they're more than just sisters and virgins.\"\n\nThe man in green frowned slightly and said, \"Old Fu, get to the point, don't keep me in suspense. What's special about them?\"\n\nManager Fu chuckled and leaned closer to the man in green, whispering, \"Today's two girls are not only sisters and virgins, but they are also a lesbian couple.\"\n\nThe Second Prince's eyes lit up. \"Excellent, a perfect specimen! Old Fu, you really are something, to be able to procure such a rare find. I love lesbians the most. Watching them in agony beneath me, I feel an indescribable thrill. Good, good, good! Come! Reward Manager Fu with one hundred purple gold coins. Old Fu, if you ever find such rare specimens in the future, be sure to save them for me. I won't treat you unfairly.\n\nQuick, let those two girls come up and let me have a look. Let them accompany me for tea first.\" Though he was lustful, he was not greedy for alcohol and rarely drank. It was currently a tense period in the struggle for the throne, and he had managed to carve out some time to come here today, having already made arrangements with Manager Fu beforehand.\n\nManager Fu quickly agreed and withdrew. Moments later, the sound of light footsteps was heard, the door opened, and two people walked in. The weather in Ice Moon City had already grown quite cold, but the temperature inside the teahouse was comfortable. The two women wore identical white short skirts, the hem of which was six inches above the knee, revealing their smooth, slender, and fair legs. They wore white tank tops, exposing their taut, flat stomachs and slender waists. Their long, black hair, like a waterfall, cascaded down their backs to their hips. Both their identical, lovely faces bore a hint of shyness.\n\nThe Second Prince's eyes brightened. \"Good, perfect specimens, truly perfect. You two can go down.\" He waved his hand at two attendants. These guards who accompanied him were his confidantes.\n\nNaturally understanding their master's intentions, they agreed and withdrew. The Second Prince beckoned to the two shy beauties. \"Come here, let this prince have a look.\"\n\nThe two beauties exchanged a glance. Their bodies trembled slightly, as if in fear of something. They cautiously approached the Second Prince and placed the tea set they were carrying down.\n\nLooking at the shy demeanor of the two beauties, the Second Prince felt a surge of lust. He pulled the girl on the left in front of him, and she let out a surprised cry. However, she dared not resist in the slightest, and was forcibly pulled by the Second Prince to sit on his lap. The Second Prince, being an experienced man, did not rush to act. He placed his right arm around the girl's slender, smooth waist and inhaled deeply, smelling her captivating virgin fragrance. He praised, \"So fragrant. My dear! If you serve me well, perhaps I'll take you to my manor.\"\n\nThe two girls exchanged a glance. The other girl, with trembling hands, poured tea for the Second Prince. Neither of them spoke, but their trembling bodies revealed their fear. The girl sitting on the Second Prince's lap seemed uncomfortable, her pretty face turning pale, her body twisting restlessly. Her movements further stimulated the Second Prince's senses. He unbuttoned his own tunic, revealing the black chest hair on his chest, and thought to himself, Old Fu was right. They really are a lesbian couple. The sensation of cruel indulgence made the Second Prince extremely excited, his breathing becoming heavy. At this moment, the girl on his lap's gaze fell upon his hairy chest, and she noticed a necklace hanging around the Second Prince's neck. The necklace was silver, with a hexagonal pendant hanging on his chest, shimmering with red, green, and yellow light. This was no ordinary necklace. The gem on it was called the Three-Eyed Stone, capable of storing three magical elements. After being magically enhanced by a powerful mage, it possessed extremely strong defensive capabilities. To harm the Second Prince's body, whether through magic or battle qi, one had to bypass this divine-grade necklace.\n\nThe Second Prince had indeed put in considerable effort to obtain this protective treasure. Having cultivated battle qi since childhood, he was already a master. Coupled with this necklace, he believed that even a Saint-level expert would not find it easy to harm him. He never took off this necklace. Given his status, his life was naturally the most important thing.\n\nHe raised his hand to take the tea offered by the other girl and took a sip. The fragrance of Tieguanyin tea soothed him throughout his body. The hot tea stimulated him, and a feeling of comfort spread through him. The hand around the waist of the girl on his lap tightened slightly, and his other hand reached under her skirt. Just then, hurried footsteps sounded from outside the door. The Second Prince frowned and stopped what he was doing.\n\nIndeed, a light knock sounded. \"Your Highness, I have important matters to report.\"\n\nThe Second Prince released the girl in his hands. The girl seemed to sigh in relief and quickly stood up, joining the other girl behind the Second Prince. The Second Prince, Yan Yin, did not see the cold glint that simultaneously appeared in both girls' eyes. He said impatiently, \"What is it, speak.\" His mood was naturally not good, having been interrupted in his pleasure.\n\nThe voice from outside said, \"Your Highness, the Fifth Prince has returned from Ice Snow City and has just entered the city.\"\n\nThe Second Prince's eyelids twitched. \"Oh? The fifth one is back. Good! This kid seems to have gained quite a lot from Ice Snow City this time. However, doesn't he understand that it's all in vain?\"\n\n\"Your Highness, should we take any action? If the Fifth Prince returns to his manor, there will be no opportunity.\"\n\nThe Second Prince Yan Yin's eyes flashed with ferocity, but he still shook his head. \"Forget it, just ignore him. The escorts around him are all masters, especially those two guest elders at the Saint level, who are not easy to deal with. This is a critical moment, and I don't want to give anyone a handle. I cannot act rashly in Ice Moon City, otherwise, it would be bad if Father Emperor found out. Father Emperor detests fraternal strife the most.\"\n\n\"Yes, Second Prince. I will immediately send people to continue monitoring the situation there. I will report to you as soon as anything is found.\"\n\n\"Ah—\" A scream of agony rang out without any warning. The Second Prince's guards outside reacted swiftly, crashing through the door with a bang. However, what they saw were two graceful figures leaping out of the window. These guards were well-trained. Some immediately surrounded the Second Prince, while other masters chased after the figures through the window.\n\nAn aged voice boomed, \"All of you, go back.\" Two torrents of silver holy battle qi descended.\n\nThey collided with the attacks of the masters who rushed out the window, immediately creating a storm of energy.\n\nSaint-level experts were also esteemed guest elders among the princes. Because they were in Ice Snow City, the Second Prince was accompanied by guards of the Warrior level. Warriors, after all, could not compare to Saints. In the fierce explosion, the masters who rushed out were repelled, and those two swift white figures had already vanished.\n\nThe Second Prince leaned back in his chair, his eyes filled with terror. His face had turned purplish-blue. Black blood continuously flowed from his seven orifices. In that brief moment, he had already died.\n\nThe captain of the guards exclaimed, \"Poison, such potent poison!\" He looked down at the Second Prince's neck. The Three-Eyed Stone necklace that had been on his neck was gone. On the back of his neck, there was a tiny pinprick, and the black blood was flowing from it. The captain of the guards' expression changed.\n\nHe reached out and sucked at the back of the Second Prince's neck. Instantly, a fine, dark blue needle was sucked out.\n\nThe needle was an inch long and as fine as a hair. If not for the faint blue light it emitted, it would have been difficult to see clearly.\n\nA guard beside him asked doubtfully, \"How could this happen? With His Highness's abilities, how could he be ambushed? Did His Highness willingly take off the necklace?\"\n\nThe captain of the guards shook his head. \"No, the necklace was removed afterward. This necklace is connected to its owner's life force. It can be removed in two ways: one, by the holder themselves, and the other, when the owner dies, the necklace can also be removed. If I'm not mistaken, the necklace was removed after the Second Prince's life had ended.\"\n\nThe guard who spoke earlier frowned. \"Why do you say that? Are you sure? The Second Prince died suddenly, how will we explain this to the First Prince! Moreover, with the necklace protecting him, how could His Highness be attacked? It doesn't make sense.\"\n\nThe captain of the guards spread his palm, revealing the fine silver needle to his subordinates and said sternly, \"Do you recognize this? This thing is extremely potent. It's what broke through His Highness's necklace defense and killed him. This needle is called the Kiss of Death. Don't underestimate this needle; it is practically priceless. There are only five sets of Kiss of Death projectile weapons on the entire continent. This needle is cast from millennium-old submerged silver and can penetrate all kinds of magic defense barriers and protective battle qi. It is said that even holy battle qi cannot resist its piercing power. The method for making the Kiss of Death has been lost. Each of the five sets of Kiss of Death can shoot ten times. They were famous on the continent hundreds of years ago. As far as I know, only one set remains in the world, and it only has three shots left. The others have either disappeared or have already been fired. To think that these assassins managed to get their hands on the Kiss of Death. Hurry, go and arrest that Manager Fu.\"\n\nMoments later, Manager Fu was brought up. Upon seeing the Second Prince lying dead, he was so terrified that he collapsed to the ground, trembling uncontrollably. He muttered to himself, \"No, it wasn't me, it wasn't me! Please, esteemed sirs, you must investigate carefully. How would I dare harm the Second Prince?\"\n\nThe captain of the guards said coldly, \"I don't care if you did it or not. His Highness died suddenly here, and you cannot escape responsibility. Tell me, where did you get those two women?\"\n\nManager Fu stammered, \"About five days ago, they came to me themselves, saying they wanted to sell themselves to bury their father. I felt pity for them, so I bought them. The price wasn't too high.\"\n\n\"Idiot.\" The captain of the guards struck Manager Fu, sending him flying. \"You know His Highness's status, how could you bring women of unknown origin to serve His Highness?\"\n\nManager Fu trembled and said, \"I, I checked their background! They were indeed from common families, orphaned in childhood, and their father recently passed away. I checked very carefully, but who knew...\"\n\nThe captain of the guards' eyes flashed with cold light, and he ordered his subordinates, \"Go, take His Highness and this fellow, we'll return to the manor first and report everything to the First Prince, asking him to handle it.\" All the guards' faces looked grim. The Second Prince had died so suddenly, and they couldn't escape responsibility. They all stared at the Second Prince's corpse with ashen faces.\n\n\"What? Second Prince died in a teahouse? Wah!\" King Yan Tiannan of the Ice Moon Empire, already gravely ill, was so enraged that he spat out a mouthful of blood.\n\n\"Your Majesty, Your Majesty, please don't be too sad.\" The Empress, shedding tears, anxiously patted Yan Tiannan's chest. The imperial physician quickly took out a pill and fed it to Yan Tiannan.\n\nYan Tiannan gasped for breath. \"Bastards! Who did this? They dared to assassinate a prince in my Ice Moon Empire! By my command, seal off the entire Ice Moon City, and find the murderer! Yin'er, Yin'er! How could you leave like this?\" He couldn't help but cough up another mouthful of blood, his face turning even more grim.\n\nThe Empress sobbed uncontrollably, \"Yin'er is dead, Yin'er is actually dead! Your Majesty, you must seek justice for Yin'er!\"\n\n\"Report, First Prince seeks an audience with Your Majesty.\"\n\nYan Tiannan's voice trembled slightly. \"Let him in.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\nA tall figure walked in from outside. Looking about thirty years old, the First Prince Yan Ji bore some resemblance to the Second Prince Yan Yin, only he was taller and more imposing. He did not appear sad because of his brother's death, but he was filled with anger. Upon entering the sleeping quarters, he immediately knelt on one knee and respectfully said, \"Your humble son greets Father Emperor.\"\n\nYan Tiannan, half-reclining on the bed, said, \"Ji'er, rise. What exactly happened to your brother?\"\n\nYan Ji walked a few steps to the bedside and stood with his hands by his side. \"Reporting to Father Emperor, today my brother went out for tea, but unexpectedly, he was assassinated by a waitress in the teahouse. I have already examined my brother's body and the murder weapon. He died from the Kiss of Death. Father Emperor, you must seek justice for my brother! He died unjustly.\"",

    "content": "Yan Tiannan’s eyes flashed with a cold light. He was somewhat clearer now, but his chest felt abnormally heavy, as if a large stone was lodged there. The Empress, choking back sobs, said, \"Your Majesty, the person who killed Yin’er must have a deep hatred for him, or it would greatly benefit them for Yin’er to die. We must start our investigation from this angle.\" With her second son dead, as a shrewd woman, she suppressed her grief and was secretly vying for her eldest son.\n\nYan Ji naturally understood his mother’s meaning and added fuel to the fire, saying, \"Your Majesty, from what I know, Fifth Brother only returned this morning.\"\n\nA flash of anger appeared in Yan Tiannan’s eyes. \"Are you implying Yun’er did it? No, that’s impossible. Yun’er is kind-hearted; how could he harm his own sibling?\"\n\nSeeing Yan Tiannan’s anger, Yan Ji quickly said, \"No, Your Majesty, that’s not what I meant. I wanted to say that you should send more guards to protect Fifth Brother, in case he is also harmed by the assassins.\"\n\nHearing Yan Ji’s words, Yan Tiannan’s expression immediately softened considerably. He nodded and said, \"Indeed, that should be done. Ji’er, you may go. Convey my oral decree, summoning Yun’er to see me.\"\n\nYan Ji knew that although Yan Tiannan didn’t say it aloud, he had already become suspicious of his fifth brother. He was overjoyed at this moment. Although he had always cooperated with Yan Yin, both of them knew that once the Fifth Prince Yan Yun was defeated by them, they would inevitably have to fight each other again. Now that Yan Yin was suddenly dead, he had one less competitor. The people who supported the second prince could be easily won over by him with a few tactics. And although it wasn't certain if Yan Yun was responsible for Yan Yin's sudden death, he wouldn't pass up such a good opportunity to strike at Yan Yun. Yan Ji’s mind was by no means as rough as his outward appearance; his sinister depths surpassed Yan Yin’s by several degrees.\n\nJust then, voices were heard from outside. \"Fifth Prince Yan Yun requests an audience with His Majesty.\"\n\nYan Tiannan’s eyes flashed. \"Let Yun’er in.\" The Empress by his side showed a hint of displeasure. From the way he was addressed, it was evident that Yan Tiannan still favored his fifth son the most.\n\nYan Yun strode into the sleeping chambers. He was extremely apprehensive at this moment. He had just returned to his own residence and hadn't even settled down when he heard the news that Yan Yin had been assassinated and died. He was instantly shocked. He naturally understood what this meant. In Ice Moon City, he was the one who opposed Yan Yin. Numerous secret conflicts had occurred in their struggle for the throne. Now that Yan Yin had suddenly died, if he hadn't thoroughly questioned his subordinates, he would have suspected himself. After all, he had thought about getting rid of the two brothers competing with him for the throne countless times, but he had always endured and not acted. After a brief moment of exhilaration, panic set in. Without hesitation, he rushed to the palace.\n\n\"Your Majesty, are you feeling any better?\" Yan Yun quickly walked to Yan Tiannan’s bedside, looking at his father with concern.\n\nSeeing Yan Yun, Yan Tiannan’s gaze softened considerably. \"Yun’er, you’re back. Have you found any clues about Luo Rou and her family’s escape?\"\n\nYan Yun sighed lightly. \"Luo Rou truly lives up to her reputation as a wise woman; she didn’t leave a single clue. Although I’ve done my best to mobilize all sorts of personnel, there’s still no news. Your Majesty, I rushed to see you as soon as I returned. I just heard outside that Second Brother had an accident. What exactly happened? Second Brother he...\" As he spoke, his eyes involuntarily reddened.\n\nThe Empress snorted coldly, \"You don’t need to put on an act here.\"\n\nYan Yun was taken aback. \"Mother, why would you say that? I only just returned. Are you suspecting me? How could that be? My Second Brother and I are siblings!\"\n\nA strong hatred flickered in the Empress’s eyes. \"Is that so? Do you really consider him your brother?\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Yan Tiannan interrupted the Empress with displeasure. \"Ji’er, escort your mother to rest. She is too grieved. Let Yun’er stay here with me for a while.\"\n\nA glint of jealousy appeared in Yan Ji’s eyes. He knew that no matter what he did, his position in front of Yan Tiannan would never be as good as his younger brother’s. He was intelligent and didn't say anything more, merely sighing and escorting the Empress away.\n\nYan Tiannan waved his hand, signaling everyone around to withdraw. Only then did he have Yan Yun sit by the edge of his bed. \"Yun’er, tell me the truth. Did you send people to do this?\" Compared to his previous gentleness, Yan Tiannan’s voice now carried a hint of coldness.\n\nA look of fear appeared on Yan Yun’s face. He immediately knelt down with a thud. \"Your Majesty, are you also suspecting me? If you truly suspect I did it, this son is willing to die to prove his innocence.\"\n\nYan Tiannan looked deeply at his son. Although Yan Yun showed no flaws on the surface, he did not fully believe his favorite fifth son. He had come this way himself. In his struggle for the throne, how could he not understand the secret bloodshed? In fact, he wasn't entirely convinced that Yan Yun was responsible either. After all, with Yan Yun's intelligence, why would he do such a foolish thing? However, in Ice Moon City, while many had reasons to kill Yan Yin, few had the power to do so, especially since the assassin used the Kiss of Death.\n\nYan Tiannan was no stranger to the Kiss of Death. It was precisely with this unparalleled deadly weapon that he had secretly killed two ministers who opposed his succession to the throne, achieving his current status. Two years ago, he had just passed the Kiss of Death to his favorite fifth son. At that time, the Kiss of Death still had three shots remaining. This secret was known only to the father and son. Therefore, when the First Prince Yan Ji said that Yan Yin had died by the Kiss of Death, he began to suspect Yan Yun.\n\n\"I believe you; I have always believed you. If it weren't for the Empress’s side pressuring me too much, I would have already named you Crown Prince. You haven't disappointed me these past few days, and the voices supporting you are growing louder. But with this incident suddenly happening, how can you expect me to act? Yan Yin is dead, and this could not possibly have been done by the Empress herself. They say a tiger doesn't eat its cubs; she doesn't have that much audacity. Yan Yin is dead; let alone others, even I cannot help but suspect you.\n\nTeach me, how can I exonerate you now? I warn you, the Empress will not let this matter rest. Behind her are the powerful Grand Tutor and the Marshal of the Tiger Guards. With Yan Yin’s sudden death, the Empress’s target will definitely be you.\"\n\nYan Yun’s eyes flashed repeatedly. \"Your Majesty, then what should I do? Should I confront the Empress and her faction directly? They have no evidence that I killed Second Brother! I am wronged.\"\n\nYan Tiannan said calmly, \"Do you know how Yin’er died? He died by the Kiss of Death. Perhaps others are unaware of the Kiss of Death.\n\nBut the Empress played a significant role in my ascension to the throne. She knew almost all my secrets. It was precisely because she helped me that I indulged her misbehavior in the harem after I ascended the throne. Where is the Kiss of Death I gave you? Don't tell me you lost it.\"\n\nYan Yun said bitterly, \"But in fact, it has been lost. Your Majesty, this must be someone framing me. Could it be... could it be Eldest Brother?\"\n\nYan Tiannan snorted coldly. \"You are too careless. I know Ji’er very well. Although he is deep in thought, he is also very intelligent. Moreover, he is of the same mother as Yan Yin, so there is some brotherly affection between them. Even if one of them ascends the throne in the future, they wouldn't make things too difficult for the other. You don't need to say anything more. After you return, protect yourself carefully. Try to keep a low profile during this period. Even if the Empress and her faction attack you, you must endure for now and wait for an opportunity. I have already ordered someone to go to the Ice God Tower to invite the Ice Goddess Priestess. Once she arrives in Ice Moon City, I will forcefully announce you as the heir to the throne. With the support of the Ice Goddess Priestess, even if the Empress and her faction dare to do anything, they won't dare to act against you. Zhi’er, I hope you can understand your father’s earnest intentions. Your mother, Concubine Ru, is my most beloved woman, and you are my most beloved son. I believe that with your intelligence, the empire will surely develop even better.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty, I...\" Yan Yun looked at his aging father. This time, he was truly moved. Although Yan Tiannan appeared frail and near the end of his life, he was so clear-headed when determining the successor. It seemed he really needed to visit Miss Bing Yun.\n\nYan Tiannan closed his eyes weakly and said, \"Alright, I am tired. You may go. One son has died, and I do not wish for this scene to happen again. No matter how you view your eldest brother and your other brothers, I hope that after you ascend the throne, you will not stain your hands with blood again. I am not a good emperor. With the support of powerful forces like the Ice God Tower, I can only maintain the existing achievements. But you are different. I have long seen that if you were to manage this country, the Ice Moon Empire would become the nightmare of the other four nations. What I have done for you is to recuperate. Now, although the territory of the Ice Moon Empire has not changed, it has actually reached its most prosperous period. As long as you can grasp it well, you will certainly be able to contend with the Hua Rong Empire. Remember, the most important thing for you is talent.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty, I understand. I will never fail to live up to your earnest intentions.\" Yan Yun took a few steps back, knelt on the ground, and respectfully kowtowed three times to Yan Tiannan before turning and leaving the palace. Although Yan Tiannan had always doted on him, this was the first time he had shown his full support. He truly was a ruler of a nation; his father’s foresight was indeed far-reaching! Yes, with the support of the Ice Goddess Priestess, coupled with his own existing prestige, how could his eldest brother compete with him?\n\nNow, all he had to do was do nothing and wait for the arrival of the Ice Goddess Priestess. Yan Yun, who had come with trepidation, was filled with ambition upon leaving the palace. He was even beginning to consider how to make the Ice Moon Empire stronger in the future. However, little did he know that a hidden hand was constantly reaching out to him. Was it really that easy to sit on the throne of the Ice Moon Empire?\n\nThe situation in Ice Moon City suddenly became tense due to the death of the Second Prince Yan Yin. Just as King Yan Tiannan had predicted, the supporters of the First Prince immediately launched a fierce attack on the Fifth Prince through this incident. Public opinion and various voices all pointed directly at the Fifth Prince. However, Yan Yun remained calm. He made no move, staying within his residence every day and completely ignoring the gossip outside. Yan Tiannan was already critically ill, and although the Empress cried and pleaded with him countless times, he brushed her off, citing the need for rest. The Fifth Prince’s supporters had all received secret notifications from him, consisting of only two words: Endure. The Fifth Prince was waiting for the opportunity Yan Tiannan had mentioned. The First Prince Yan Ji’s superficial brilliance could not affect his good mood.\n\nAt the same time, in contrast to the First Prince Yan Ji’s overbearing demeanor and the Fifth Prince Yan Yun’s hidden presence, there was another person in the royal family of the Ice Moon Empire who was most active: the Seventh Prince Yan Feng.\n\nEvery morning, a large number of red roses would appear at the entrance of the Blood-Devouring Soul-Destroying Snow Soul Marshal’s residence. Yan Feng, alone on his horse, would arrive outside the Snow Soul Marshal’s residence and stand there, seemingly waiting for something. This continued for five days. Yan Feng’s peculiar behavior, coupled with his status as a prince, immediately attracted the attention of many commoners. Every day, his visits to the Marshal’s residence attracted a large crowd of onlookers.\n\nOn the sixth day, in the morning, as Yan Feng arrived at the Snow Soul residence again, the gate opened, and Xue Yu, the only daughter of Marshal Snow Soul, came out in resplendent attire. To the astonishment of the onlookers, this Marshal’s daughter actually linked arms with Yan Feng. Yan Feng then publicly announced that he was formally pursuing Miss Xue Yu. This news immediately caused a huge stir among the common people. The Seventh Prince, who had always been considered homosexual, was now pursuing the daughter of the Blood-Devouring Soul-Destroying Marshal, one of the three marshals known for their iron-blooded nature. Furthermore, Marshal Snow Soul did not come out to express his opposition, and judging by Xue Yu’s intimate demeanor with Yan Feng, they seemed to have been dating for quite some time. Suddenly, among the common folk, those who had previously believed Yan Feng to be homosexual began to have doubts.\n\nFrom then on, Yan Feng continued to bring flowers to welcome Xue Yu every morning, as if the political turmoil in Ice Moon City had nothing to do with him. Although his affairs were also heard by the First Prince and the Fifth Prince, the two influential princes were fully focused on their struggle for the throne. Who would bother with a younger brother who had no power? Therefore, the political storms did not affect Yan Feng in the slightest. Every morning, he would joyfully arrive at Marshal Snow Soul’s residence with Xue Yu, and they would tour various places in Ice Moon City. Every slightly famous spot in the city had been visited by them.",

    "content": "A month passed amidst political turmoil. The health of King Yan Tiannan of the Ice Moon Empire worsened, but he held on, waiting for someone. He wasn't ready to die yet.\n\nMarshal Xue Po's Mansion.\n\n\"No, this won't do! Nian Bing, we can discuss other things, but I absolutely will not agree to this.\"\n\nYan Feng's breathing was somewhat erratic as he looked at Nian Bing, who wore a smile, and Marshal Xue Po. Xue Yu, sitting beside them, lowered her head, her pretty face and slender, fair neck flushed with shy embarrassment.\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Why won't it do? It's going to happen sooner or later anyway.\"\n\nYan Feng glanced awkwardly at Xue Yu. \"But, but this will damage Yu'er's reputation! Even if it's fake, I don't want Yu'er to be gossiped about behind her back.\"\n\nXue Po smiled. Although Yan Feng and Xue Yu's actions had been for show these past few days, he could see that his daughter had been living a life of unparalleled happiness. Yan Feng had been a bit awkward with Xue Yu at first, but Nian Bing's words had opened his heart. He was, after all, a normal man, and under Nian Bing's guidance, he was gradually progressing toward normality. If Xue Po weren't worried, that would be impossible. However, Nian Bing had assured him that if Yan Feng couldn't bring Xue Yu happiness, he wouldn't force them together. He had also secretly asked his daughter. Xue Yu told her father about Yan Feng's childhood experiences. Faced with Nian Bing's noble status and his daughter's happiness, Xue Po reluctantly compromised. As time went on, Yan Feng's changes over the past month were very apparent. He was no longer as cold and indifferent as before, and he had gained much confidence. Yes, it was strong confidence. Yan Feng was gradually revealing another side of himself. Xue Po was surprised to find that in terms of talent, bearing, and overall performance, Yan Feng's comprehensive qualities were no less than those of the Fifth Prince, Yan Yun. At times, he even appeared more profound than Yan Yun. He later realized that despite his outwardly decadent appearance over the years, Yan Feng had been working hard in secret, constantly enriching himself. Although he knew it would be difficult to achieve anything significant, he hadn't truly given up. This time, Nian Bing had found him and offered him a chance for adventure. Yan Feng knew this might be his only chance in life. Ever since his mother's death, he had grown weary of the world; life was no longer important. With this opportunity, how could he not seize it? Therefore, he had been working hard, following Nian Bing's plan step by step.\n\nXue Yu had been the happiest during these days. She didn't know what plans her father and Nian Bing had, only that her father had suddenly changed his ways and seemed to be supporting Yan Feng in re-establishing a new image in Ice Moon City. Yan Feng no longer hid his feelings as he had before; he had opened his heart, and his heart had opened to her. Her hidden hopes had suddenly become reality, filling Xue Yu with a sense of happiness. Nian Bing was no longer just a cook in the Xue Po mansion; he held the status of an honored guest. For the past month, Nian Bing still left during the day and returned at night, but no one knew what he was doing.\n\nXue Po said, \"That's enough, Seventh Prince. You don't need to think so much anymore. If I, as a father, don't object, why should you? Only by doing this can you truly change the impression people have of you in Ice Moon City and truly prove that you are a man. You just need to remember how much Yu'er has sacrificed for you. As long as Yu'er can be happy, I don't have many other requests.\"\n\nYan Feng sighed deeply and looked back at Xue Yu. Xue Yu was also looking up at him. Their eyes met, and emotions flowed through the air. Everyone has feelings. Since meeting Xue Yu, Yan Feng had learned what warmth was. It wasn't that he didn't have feelings for Xue Yu; he had just been suppressing himself. He hadn't dared to hope for anything. Although he was a prince, his reputation was so bad, how could he hope for the Marshal's daughter? But Nian Bing's appearance had given him this chance, and neither he nor Xue Yu had to hide their feelings anymore.\n\nTurning around, Yan Feng suddenly strode forward and knelt before Xue Po with a thud. Xue Po was startled and quickly reached out to help him up. \"Seventh Prince, what are you doing?\"\n\nNian Bing held Xue Po back and smiled, \"Marshal Xue, please let him kneel.\"\n\nYan Feng looked at Nian Bing with gratitude, his expression becoming exceptionally solemn. He slowly raised his right hand, holding up his index, middle, and ring fingers towards the sky. \"Marshal Xue, I, Yan Feng, swear before you. As long as I live, no matter what my status changes to in the future, I, Yan Feng, will have only Yu'er as my woman for this life and this world. I will never regret it. If I break my promise, I am willing to die from a thousand poisons piercing my heart.\" Every word he spoke was decisive, without a trace of hesitation. This was Yan Feng's only oath in his life, and the most important one.\n\nXue Po was somewhat stunned. Xue Yu, standing beside him, had also stood up and knelt silently beside Yan Feng. A hint of crystal clarity appeared in her gentle gaze.\n\nLooking at Yan Feng, whose eyes were filled with determination, Xue Po knew that although Yan Feng was currently just an ordinary prince, his oath was incredibly solemn. If he could truly become the King of the Ice Moon Empire, then his promise would signify that he would only have one wife, and there would be no scene of three thousand beautiful concubines. In the history of the Azure Sun Continent, no emperor had ever achieved this.\n\nXue Po looked at Yan Feng. \"Good, Nian Bing has not mistaken the person. You indeed have potential worth cultivating. Yan Feng, from this moment on, I will not treat you as a prince. I heard from Yu'er that you never experienced family affection since childhood. A son-in-law is also like half a son. From now on, you are my son. Your oath has also helped you secure the engagement with Yu'er. I bless you both.\"\n\nYan Feng was overjoyed and quickly bowed to the ground, respectfully kowtowing three times to Xue Po. \"Dad...\"\n\nIn the early morning, although the weather was cold, there were still quite a few commoners stopping at the entrance of Marshal Xue Po's mansion. Most of them wanted to see if the Seventh Prince, known for his peculiar preferences, was truly pursuing the Marshal's daughter. Just then, the sound of horse hooves echoed. A swift horse approached the Marshal's mansion like lightning. The commoners all turned to look. It was the Seventh Prince, Yan Feng. However, Yan Feng was different today, and the change was drastic. Without his usual fine clothes, he rode a horse with his upper body bare, wearing only trousers. On his back, he carried a thick, long thorny branch. In the blink of an eye, he arrived at the entrance of the Marshal's mansion. The surprised onlookers saw that Yan Feng's back was already covered in bloody marks from being scraped by the thorns. His skin was also emitting wisps of steam due to the cold weather.\n\nThe commoners immediately began to murmur. What was going on? Why was the Seventh Prince dressed like this today? Could this be the legendary \"carrying thorns to ask for forgiveness\"? What had he done? Was he really gay? Had he come to beg for forgiveness because he couldn't be with Miss Xue Yu? All sorts of speculations arose, and the surroundings became somewhat chaotic for a moment. However, the commoners still made way for Yan Feng, allowing him to ride his horse to the entrance of the Marshal's mansion.\n\nAs they got closer, the commoners could see clearly that Yan Feng, who had always been considered gay, had an extremely well-built physique. His granite-like muscles exuded explosive power. Coupled with his stern aura and steady posture, at this moment, no one would ever consider him gay again.\n\nYan Feng leaped off his horse, tied it to a large tree nearby, and completely ignored the surrounding onlookers. He strode to the entrance of the Marshal's mansion and said to the two guards at the gate, \"Please inform Marshal Xue that Yan Feng has come to beg for forgiveness.\" As he spoke, he knelt on one knee. It was known that he was a prince, albeit a powerless one. He could only kneel on both knees before King Yan Tiannan. At this moment, kneeling on one knee was the highest form of courtesy he could offer.\n\nThe two guards appeared somewhat nervous and quickly sent one of them into the mansion to report. Yan Feng remained kneeling there. The biting cold wind constantly caused wisps of heat to rise from his body. The marks scraped by the thorns on his back were so obvious, but his face showed a look of unwavering determination, as if nothing could stop him at this moment.\n\nAfter a short while, the gate of the Marshal's mansion opened. Marshal Xue Po, with a frosty expression, walked out. Nian Bing, wearing a white robe and with long white hair, followed behind him.\n\nXue Po's eyes flashed with cold light. Standing on the steps, he looked down at the kneeling Yan Feng. \"Why have you come again, Your Highness the Seventh Prince? Our humble dwelling cannot accommodate your presence. Please return.\"\n\nYan Feng slowly raised his head and, with his right hand, drew the thorny branch from behind his back, drawing a spray of blood. He held the thorny branch in both hands, slowly extending it forward. \"Marshal Xue, although I have made a mistake, I, Yan Feng, am a man of integrity. If I make a mistake, I will admit it. Today, I ask for your forgiveness in front of the elders and neighbors of Ice Moon City. I should not have been involved with Miss Xue Yu behind your back and caused her to become pregnant. Marshal Xue, no matter how you punish me, I will accept it. Even if you demand my life, Yan Feng will not hesitate. However, Miss Xue Yu is already my woman, and she is carrying my flesh and blood in her womb. Please do not make things difficult for her. All mistakes are mine alone, Yan Feng. Please punish me.\" Yan Feng's words immediately caused an uproar among the surrounding commoners, and the scene became exceptionally chaotic. Although there were many speculations, none of the commoners expected that the Seventh Prince, who was always called gay, had not only been involved with the Marshal's daughter but had even conceived a child with her? What kind of gay person was this? He already had a child! Looking at Yan Feng's fearless attitude and his willingness to admit his mistakes, the commoners' impression of him changed greatly, and they even felt some sympathy.\n\n\"You...\" Xue Po's face contorted with anger. \"Good, good, good! I, Xue Po, must have committed some grave sin in my past life... I...\" He reached out to take the thorny branch, but his hand stopped in mid-air, unable to grasp it.\n\nYan Feng knelt there, but his upper body was held straight, showing no fear. His gaze was fixed on Xue Po. \"Please, Marshal, make your move. As long as you forgive me and allow Miss Yu'er to marry me, I am willing to pay any price.\"\n\nXue Po trembled slightly with anger. \"You are a prince, a member of the royal family. I am a subject. How can you expect me to punish you? What a karma, what a true karma!\"\n\nNian Bing, who had been behind Xue Po, walked over and sighed. \"Yuan Kun, the mistake has already been made. With the Seventh Prince's status, he is worthy of our young lady. Do you want to see our young lady suffer her entire life? Please forgive the Seventh Prince. Although the Seventh Prince made a mistake, he bravely admitted it, making him a true man. Please forgive him. I believe that Miss Yu'er will be happy with His Highness the Seventh Prince. Don't you all agree?\" He deliberately raised his voice on the last sentence.\n\nNian Bing's call immediately provoked a clamor from the crowd. \"Yes! Marshal, please forgive them...\"\n\nXue Po closed his eyes in \"agony.\" After a long time, he finally let out a long sigh. \"Fine, fine. What else can I do? Come in with me.\" Saying this, he turned and walked into the Marshal's mansion.\n\nSeeing this, the surrounding crowd erupted in cheers. Nian Bing stepped forward, picked up the thorny branch from Yan Feng's hand, and tossed it aside. He then helped Yan Feng up. The two exchanged a smile. The intended effect had been achieved. Yan Feng bowed to the surrounding commoners. \"Thank you, friends, for your help. Yan Feng is grateful.\" For a prince to bow to commoners brought them a strong sense of closeness. The cheers grew even louder. Nian Bing then led Yan Feng into the Marshal's mansion.\n\nAs soon as the main gate closed, Xue Yu rushed forward, tears streaming down her face. She wrapped her cloak around Yan Feng's body. \"Ah Feng, does it hurt?\"\n\nYan Feng gently pulled Xue Yu into his embrace. \"It's nothing. These injuries are nothing to me. Don't forget, I'm also close to the level of a martial artist. Nian Bing has planned everything so meticulously for me. What is this small sacrifice? If I can't become king, how can I be worthy of you? I wasn't just trying to prove myself to others just now; I was trying to prove myself to you, to let you know that I have become a true man. I will never go back on my oath.\"\n\nXue Yu hugged Yan Feng tightly. \"Ah Feng, I believe you. Even if you don't become king, in this life and this world, I will only be yours.\"\n\nNian Bing coughed from the side. \"Excuse me, you two. Shouldn't we go inside and treat Yan Feng? His back injuries aren't serious, but it seems to be bleeding continuously.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Xue Yu finally came to her senses and quickly pulled Yan Feng towards the room.\n\nThe Inn.\n\nBing Yun looked at the sleeping Maomao, a rare warmth flickering in her eyes. Maomao slept unattractively, clutching her blanket and drooling slightly, as if dreaming of something delicious. But her cute and naive appearance reminded Bing Yun of her own childhood. If only I could have a sister like this!",

    "content": "A month passed, and Bing Yun was surprised to find herself content with her current life. She spent her days at the inn accompanying Maomao, occasionally strolling through the streets to buy delicious food to share with her. It was a relaxed feeling she hadn't experienced in a long time. From a young age, she had studied magic with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. Although the Priestess treated her very well, her demands were also very strict. Under the Priestess's meticulous guidance, she achieved her current accomplishments. The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had once told her, \"Among the younger generation, you are already an outstanding talent, and it's difficult for anyone to surpass you.\"\n\nIndeed, Bing Yun's cultivation was far superior to that of ordinary mages. She had undoubtedly used countless precious magic gems. Coupled with the guidance of the continent's only Divine Descender, her magical progress was terrifying. She was not yet twenty years old this year but had already reached the level of a Magister, possessing the formidable power of an innate domain. Therefore, Bing Yun had always been arrogant. Her arrogance, stemming from her strength, made it difficult for her to look down on ordinary people. She always felt a sense of superiority, like a goddess overlooking the world.\n\nHowever, the arrogance in her heart only lasted until the New Talent Mage Competition. She never imagined she would lose. Upon arriving at the Huá Róng Empire, her sole objective was the championship. Although the disciples of the Rong family were also outstanding, she firmly believed that with her talent and her far-above-average efforts, no one could be her opponent. Even when she ultimately lost to Nian Bing, she didn't believe she had truly lost. She felt she had lost due to Nian Bing's despicable methods, which was why she hated him – hated his despicable and vile nature, hated that he had used a magic array to restrict her innate domain and mental power. Thus, she had always wanted to find an opportunity for revenge against Nian Bing. Yet, she never could have imagined that the vile man she once disdained would, upon their next meeting, have transformed into a master she could not possibly reach.\n\nBing Yun had a deep understanding of magic, and naturally, she could see that Nian Bing's strength had reached the level of a Magus. Furthermore, he also possessed an innate domain. Judging by his application of it, it seemed he hadn't just recently acquired it, as his usage was very proficient. Bing Yun felt discouraged; her heart was heavy. She truly couldn't understand how this young man, who appeared to be around her age, could possess such immense power. What astonished her even more was that Nian Bing was also a chef, an exceptionally skilled one. Her culinary skills indicated that he had also dedicated a great deal of time to this craft; otherwise, he wouldn't have achieved such results. Bing Yun felt a bit lost, unable to comprehend how Nian Bing had accomplished all this. Nian Bing had become a mystery in her heart.\n\nWhen she left the Ice God Tower, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had instructed her to track down the whereabouts of the Ice Snow Goddess Stone whenever an opportunity arose. This gem was the treasure of the entire Ice God Tower, and only by retrieving it could she break through to the Magister realm. But what could she do now? She was no match for Nian Bing. Even using the influence of the Ice God Tower in Ice Moon City would be futile. Nian Bing's unfathomable strength made her hesitate. She absolutely did not wish for the Ice God Tower's personnel to suffer losses at Nian Bing's hands. Besides her master, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, she couldn't think of anyone in the Ice God Tower who could defeat Nian Bing, who possessed the strength of a Magus, an innate domain, and the ability to control seven elemental magics, in a one-on-one confrontation. Therefore, she had been waiting, waiting for Nian Bing to accompany her back to the Ice God Tower. Even she couldn't explain why she trusted Nian Bing's words so much.\n\nAlthough Bing Yun was unwilling to admit it, she had indeed begun to enjoy her current life. Simply eating the delicacies prepared by Nian Bing was a wonderful experience; she had never tasted such delicious food since childhood. Thus, she wasn't in any hurry. A month had passed, and she had spent it peacefully. Seeing Nian Bing every day had seemingly become a habit.\n\nAs Bing Yun was lost in thought, she suddenly trembled. She clasped her hands together in front of her chest and quietly recited a few incantations. A blue light gradually condensed before her. With a flash of light, a transparent and crystalline crystal ball appeared before her.\n\nA clear image gradually materialized within the crystal ball.\n\n\"Bing Yun, where are you now?\" a kind voice inquired. It was Bing Leng from the Ice God Tower, who had raised her since she was little.\n\nBing Leng was a servant of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess and the most loyal person to her. She had followed the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess for sixty years. Although her talent was not exceptional, under the Priestess's guidance, she had reached the level of a Magus, becoming one of the four Magi of the Ice God Tower and the person the Priestess trusted the most. When Bing Yun was at the Ice God Tower, apart from studying magic with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, she was always with Bing Leng. Bing Leng was responsible for her daily life, caring for her like a mother. If there was anyone Bing Yun liked most in the Ice God Tower, it wasn't the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, but Bing Leng, because only Bing Leng could bring her some warmth in the cold world of the Ice God Tower. Regarding her master, she felt only respect and admiration. In her eyes, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess was an insurmountable mountain.\n\n\"Aunt Bing Leng, did you need me for something? Has Master finished her seclusion?\" Bing Yun smiled as she looked at Bing Leng in the crystal ball. Only in front of Bing Leng did her smile appear so natural.\n\n\"Little Bing Yun! You're getting more and more beautiful. Lady Ice Snow Goddess Priestess hasn't finished her seclusion yet. The envoy sent by the King of the Ice Moon Empire has been waiting for her for quite some time, and seems quite anxious. That King of the Ice Moon Empire probably won't last much longer. However, you know your Master's temper. Once the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess enters seclusion, no one is allowed to disturb her.\"\n\nBing Yun nodded and said, \"Auntie, what do you need me for? Is there something at the tower that requires my return?\"\n\nBing Leng shook her head and replied, \"Not really. You suddenly left without a word a few days ago, and I was very worried! Judging by the energy fluctuations, you should be in Ice Moon City now. What? Did you find anything there?\"\n\nBing Yun hesitated before answering, \"Auntie, it's like this, I've found the person who possesses the Ice Snow Goddess Stone. He promised to return to the Ice God Tower with me after he finishes his own affairs, so I'm waiting for him now.\"\n\nA cold glint flashed in Bing Leng's eyes. \"Since you've found him, why didn't you capture him? When did the people of our Ice God Tower learn to wait for others? Yun'er, this isn't like you!\"\n\nBing Yun sighed lightly and said, \"I wanted to capture him, but I'm simply not his match, so how could I capture him?\"\n\nBing Leng looked at Bing Yun in surprise. \"You're not his match? That's impossible. With your Ice Snow Goddess Domain, even against a Magister, you might not be his opponent? Did some renowned mage on the continent snatch the Ice Snow Goddess Stone from you?\"\n\nBing Yun shook her head and said, \"No, the person I'm talking about is the one who defeated me in the New Talent Mage Competition. His magic is very strange, and he also has an innate domain. His innate domain seems to have a restraining effect on my Ice Goddess Domain, so I can only wait now. If we use our people in Ice Moon City, I'm afraid it will cause unnecessary losses.\"\n\nBing Leng looked at Bing Yun with some concern. \"Yun'er, why do I feel like something is wrong with you? How about this, I'll make a trip to Ice Moon City. With our combined strength, we should be able to capture him.\"\n\n\"No need.\" Even Bing Yun was surprised by how quickly she answered. A hint of awkwardness flashed across her face. \"Auntie, Master is in seclusion now, and you need to manage the affairs at the Ice God Tower. I believe that even though Master is in seclusion, she is aware of external matters. Since the Ice Moon Empire is going to change its heir, she will surely come out of seclusion beforehand. You should stay at the Ice God Tower; I can handle things here.\"\n\nBing Leng asked doubtfully, \"Yun'er, who exactly is this person who possesses the Ice Snow Goddess Stone?\"\n\nBing Yun glanced at Bing Leng's concerned gaze in the crystal ball, sighed softly, and said, \"Actually, he has some connection with our Ice God Tower. He is senior disciple Bing Jie's son. Back then, he fell off a cliff but didn't die, and he has been cultivating with the Ice Snow Goddess Stone.\"\n\nBing Leng's body trembled. \"What did you say? He's Jie'er's son? My goodness! Jie'er's son is still alive? This, this...\" Her heart seemed to become unsettled, and her eyes revealed a complex light. She remained silent for a long time.\n\nBing Yun continued, \"It is for this reason that I have been hesitant about bringing him back. Is it really good to bring him back? Master still hasn't gotten over what happened back then. If I bring him back, and he is... then senior disciple Bing Jie would probably also...\" She fell silent at this point.\n\nBing Leng sighed deeply. \"What a karmic debt! Everything that happened that year deeply wounded your Master's heart. You started learning magic with your Master from a young age, do you know why she was so strict with you? A large part of it was because of senior disciple Bing Jie. Previously, your Master had a very good temper and treated Bing Jie as her own daughter. But who would have thought that Bing Jie would end up with someone from the Rong family? I was the only one who saw your Master's pain at that time. She actually cried. In the sixty years I've followed her, that was the only time I saw her shed tears.\"\n\nBing Yun slowly nodded. \"I understand. Even now, senior disciple Bing Jie holds a very, very important position in Master's heart. However, Master seems to have a knot in her heart. Until this knot in her heart is untangled, she probably won't let senior sister out. I truly hope Master can figure things out sooner. Forcing things yields no results.\"\n\nBing Leng said, \"Alright, I won't talk to you anymore. Be careful on your own. If you encounter any danger, send me a message using the crystal ball, and I'll rush over as quickly as possible.\" With a flash of light, the light in the crystal ball dimmed. Bing Yun waved her hand and put it away. Her mind was a bit chaotic. Although she had only met Bing Jie a few times, it was when she was very young. In her memory, Bing Jie was a very gentle woman, giving her a maternal feeling. However, in her memory, Bing Jie never seemed happy; there was always a hint of sorrow in her expression until she was...\n\n\"Sister, Sister, why are you doing this?\" a sorrowful voice echoed from behind Bing Yun.\n\nBing Yun's heart startled. She turned around to see that Maomao had woken up at some unknown time and was looking at her with a face full of grief and indignation.\n\nBing Yun looked at Maomao in surprise. \"Did you hear what I just said?\"\n\nMaomao nodded vigorously. \"Sister Bing Yun, Brother Nian Bing is so good, why do you want to capture him? He cooks for us every day and even saved my life. Brother is a good person! Sister, please don't capture him, okay?\"\n\nA wry smile appeared on Bing Yun's face. Facing Maomao's plea, she really didn't know how to answer.\n\nThe sadness on Maomao's small face deepened. \"Sister, I always thought you were Brother Nian Bing's girlfriend, and you were just ignoring him because you had a fight. I didn't realize... I didn't realize you were his enemy. Sister, I know you're a powerful mage, but if you want to capture Brother Nian Bing, capture me first. I'm willing to be captured in place of Brother Nian Bing.\"\n\nBing Yun looked at Maomao. She couldn't imagine that this girl, who was a few years younger than her, could have such deep feelings for Nian Bing. She sighed softly. \"Maomao, do you think doing this is worth it?\"\n\n\"It's worth it!\" Maomao answered without hesitation. \"Brother Nian Bing is so good to me, just like an older brother. Sister, you don't know, Maomao has no siblings. I've been alone with Dad and Mom since I was little, I don't know how lonely it was. That time, when Maomao met Brother Nian Bing, I was out of money and had no food. It was Brother Nian Bing who helped me, and later, he saved my life. Maomao has always treated him as her own brother. Although I like you a lot too, Sister, if you're going to target Brother Nian Bing, Maomao won't let you succeed.\" As she spoke, a faint silver light shimmered in Maomao's eyes.\n\nBing Yun felt a sudden dizziness, and her mental power seemed to shrink. She was startled and quickly gathered her mental power, which dispelled the feeling of weakness. She looked at Maomao in surprise. \"Is this mental magic?\"\n\nMaomao's gaze towards Bing Yun became more guarded. \"Yes! Maomao is very powerful. I have many powerful little pets. If you're going to do anything to Brother Nian Bing, kill Maomao first, otherwise, I will definitely stop you.\"",

    "title": "Chapter 148: The Conflict between Qianhuan Bingyun (Part 2)",
    "content": "Bing Yun felt a trace of helplessness rise in her heart. She vaguely sensed that her peaceful life of these past few days was about to end. Nian Bing, oh Nian Bing, do you have such great charm? Even a cute young girl like Cat Cat is willing to pay such a price for you? What kind of person are you? Are you someone who will stop at nothing to achieve your goals? Or...\n\nSeeing that Bing Yun did not react, Cat Cat thought she looked down on her and quickly chanted a spell, summoning her most powerful summoned beast. With a flash of light, a pink little pig appeared before Cat Cat. It was the little pig Guan Guan. Guan Guan was now a size larger than before. The most obvious change was its ears. Its already large ears now drooped to its plump belly. Cat Cat pointed at Guan Guan, and its large ears moved, flapping and lifting itself into the air, warily watching Bing Yun.\n\nLooking at Guan Guan's chubby appearance, Bing Yun chuckled, \"What a cute little pig! Cat Cat, is this your pet?\"\n\nCat Cat nodded and said, \"Yes, this is my little pig Guan Guan. Sister, don't underestimate it. Guan Guan is very powerful after its second evolution.\"\n\nBing Yun smiled slightly and said, \"So you are a Caucasian, and a rare Summoning Mage. Cat Cat is indeed very strong. However, Sister has no ill intentions. Please put your pet away.\"\n\nCat Cat was stunned and asked, \"Then will Sister still deal with Brother Nian Bing?\"\n\nBing Yun frowned and said, \"How about this? Sister promises you. As long as you are here, Sister will not deal with your Brother Nian Bing. Is that acceptable?\"\n\nCat Cat giggled and said, \"Okay! Okay! I knew Sister was the best.\" As she spoke, she beckoned to Guan Guan, picked it up into her arms, and squeezed its chubby body with great enjoyment. The poor Guan Guan's fat bottom wriggled from side to side, seeming displeased but not daring to resist its owner.\n\nThe sound of knocking suddenly echoed, \"Excuse me, is Miss Bing Yun in?\"\n\nBing Yun's expression changed. She returned to her usual cold demeanor, \"Who is it? What do you need?\"\n\n\"I am Yan Yun, the Fifth Prince of the Ice Moon Empire. I wish to seek an audience with Miss Bing Yun. May I know if Miss is available?\" Yan Yun's words were very polite. He would not dare offend the people of the Ice God Tower.\n\nAlthough Bing Yun was somewhat annoyed, the Ice God Tower had always had a good relationship with the Ice Moon Empire's royal family. She calmly said, \"Please come in.\" As she spoke, she put on the veil she had placed aside.\n\nYan Yun pushed the door open and entered. As soon as he entered, he clearly felt a cold aura permeating the air. His eyes immediately landed on Bing Yun, who was sitting on the bed. Although the information he had received indicated that Bing Yun was a stunning beauty, he was still stunned when he actually saw her. He had been with many women, but none had ever given him such a powerful shock. Her incredibly noble demeanor and exceptionally cold aura made her seem not like a woman, but like an ice and snow goddess descended from heaven.\n\nBing Yun's cold snort startled Yan Yun. He realized he had lost his composure and quickly apologized, \"I am truly sorry. Miss's radiance is like the pure white bright moon. Yan Yun has no intention of being disrespectful. Please forgive me, Miss Bing Yun.\"\n\nBing Yun did not offer the Fifth Prince a seat and calmly said, \"Your Highness, please state your business directly.\"\n\nYan Yun smiled slightly and said, \"Miss Bing Yun has come to Ice Moon City. How could I not pay my respects? Miss's current residence is a bit too simple. If Miss does not mind, I have a villa in the east of the city that is quite peaceful. Apart from servants, no one else resides there. Would Miss...?\" He had finally managed to disguise himself and leave his residence today. In the past month, there had been countless rumors attacking him, and they had not yet subsided. The First Prince's supporters were spreading unfavorable news about him every day. However, with Yan Tiannan's promise, Yan Yun was not in a hurry. He had free time to leave his residence today specifically to see Miss Bing Yun, who might inherit the position of Ice and Snow Goddess's High Priestess.\n\nBing Yun replied coldly, \"No need to trouble yourself. I am very comfortable here. If Your Highness has nothing else, you may leave. I know that the city is in turmoil because of your affairs. Until my Master arrives, I will not participate in such matters.\" Being as intelligent as she was, how could she not know Yan Yun's purpose in seeking her out? Before Yan Yun could speak, she had already declared her neutral stance.\n\nYan Yun smiled slightly and said, \"I have no other intentions. Miss and I both have the character 'Yun' in our names. Speaking of which, we are fated. I specifically came to see Miss today. May I know if I am fortunate enough to invite Miss Bing Yun to dine?\"\n\n\"Both have 'Yun' in their names? I think Sister Bing Yun is a cloud of purity untouched by dust, while you are a dark cloud,\" Cat Cat said from the side, feeling a bit unhappy with Yan Yun's appearance and couldn't help but mock him.\n\nYan Yun finally noticed the other girl in the room. Although Cat Cat was sixteen years old, she still looked like a girl around fourteen, especially since she was holding the little pig Guan Guan, which made her look even cuter. Yan Yun flashed a smile that he thought was very gentle, \"Who is this little sister?\"\n\nCat Cat jumped off the bed, puffed out her chest, and said, \"Little what little? How am I little? You're so rude. And I'm not your sister. Can't you see my Sister Bing Yun is very annoyed with you? Hurry up and leave, don't be like a fly.\"\n\nYan Yun turned to Bing Yun somewhat awkwardly, \"Miss Bing Yun, what do you say?\"\n\nBing Yun didn't give Yan Yun any face at all and said calmly, \"Cat Cat's meaning is my meaning. Your Highness, please leave.\"\n\nA cold light flashed in Yan Yun's eyes. He thought to himself, \"So arrogant. When I unify the entire continent, one day I will make you beg for mercy under my crotch.\" Although he thought this, he said outwardly without showing it, \"Since that is the case, Yan Yun will take his leave. I hope to have the opportunity to meet Miss Bing Yun again in the future.\" After saying this, he slowly walked out of the room.\n\nCat Cat snorted. \"Sister, that guy seems to have ill intentions. When you were chasing him away just now, I clearly felt a strange fluctuation in his spirit. He must be thinking of some bad idea.\" Although Cat Cat's spiritual power was not very strong now, she was Caucasian after all and was inherently very sensitive to spiritual power. Even Nian Bing, with his powerful spiritual power, could not perceive as strongly as she could without using his Heavenly Eye Acupoint.\n\nBing Yun smiled slightly and said, \"He's just a bored person. Cat Cat! It seems your Brother Nian Bing will come back to cook for us at noon. What do you want to eat? Sister will take you.\"\n\nCat Cat smiled and said, \"Okay! Okay! Cat Cat is also hungry. I don't know what Brother Nian Bing has been doing these past few days. He's always missing, which is very strange.\"\n\nWhile Cat Cat was displeased, a sudden piece of news shocked the entire Ice Moon City.\n\nThe Bloodthirsty Soul Extinguishing Snow Phantom, one of the three marshals of the Ice Moon Empire, suddenly announced that he would marry his daughter, Xue Yu, to the Seventh Prince Yan Feng. This news immediately made the already chaotic situation in Ice Moon City even more muddled. However, this news was very real. The scene that Yan Feng created at the entrance of the Marshal's mansion had already spread throughout the city. Although some people had their suspicions, they already had a child, so what could Marshal Snow Phantom do even if he was unwilling? After all, she was his only daughter!\n\nSnow Phantom held a very high position in the military. Although he was on par with the other two marshals, his prestige was significantly higher than theirs. He controlled the Ice Moon Empire's most elite knight corps, and his iron-blooded style in past battles was extremely fierce. No one dared to underestimate his influence. The military was an independent system, and Snow Phantom's deterrence was extremely strong, with a considerable number of military personnel loyal to him. The First Prince immediately went to Marshal Snow Phantom's mansion to offer congratulations and express his support. Various officials also brought gifts to Snow Phantom's residence. Soon, the Fifth Prince Yan Yun, who had been in hiding, also sent a congratulatory gift.\n\nThe marriage of princes had always been decided by the King. Snow Phantom announced in front of all the guests that he would visit the King with the Seventh Prince Yan Feng tomorrow and propose this marriage, seeking the King Yan Tiannan's consent.\n\nWho didn't know what kind of person Snow Phantom was? Once he stated his position, those who had previously looked down on Yan Feng and disdained him all shut their mouths. Offending a prince like Yan Feng was nothing, but offending the ruthless Bloodthirsty Soul Extinguishing would be unbearable. For a time, Yan Feng's previously poor reputation changed considerably, and some people were even speaking well of Yan Feng everywhere. A marshal, who usually stood by silently without expressing opinions in court, would definitely hold a higher position than a prime minister in wartime, especially a powerful figure like Snow Phantom who was skilled in combat. Whoever sat on the throne in the future would have to appease this important minister of the empire. Even the First Prince and Fifth Prince, who were fiercely competing, did not wish to offend Snow Phantom at this time. Although they all had a bad relationship with Yan Feng, they now made extra efforts to win over their seventh brother.\n\nYan Feng continued to live his life as usual and did not appear in the Marshal's mansion. He accepted the envoys sent by his two elder brothers to congratulate him, but he did not respond to their subtle hints. In the eyes of the envoys, he remained the ordinary Seventh Prince with no grand ambitions.\n\n...\n\n\"Boom—\" Nian Bing flew backward, the protective Heavenly Eye Domain's light greatly weakened, and his gaze became much dimmer. He raised his hand and said, \"Alright, let's stop here for today.\"\n\nThe Great Elder smiled at Nian Bing and said, \"En, the Cult Master's magic power has progressed greatly these days, and his control over spiritual power has also made significant progress. I see that in no time, the seven of us old fellows won't be able to contain you.\" For the past month, in addition to acting in secret, Nian Bing had not been idle. He spent every day diligently cultivating. He was now the new Cult Master of the Blood Lion Cult, and the seven elders held nothing back from him. By interacting with the seven elders, Nian Bing realized how naive some of his ideas were. Under their guidance, he had become more mature than before. The plan for this change of regime was much more meticulous than initially conceived. Intelligence networks were deployed, and not only Ice Moon City but the entire Ice Moon Empire's Blood Lion Cult forces were mobilized.\n\nAt the same time, Nian Bing's abilities had been growing through the tempering of the seven elders. A major secret of the Blood Lion Cult was that every previous Cult Master had to reach the Divine Master or Divine Descendant realm. This was why there was such a perverse method of becoming a regular member tested by the seven elders. With the special nature of his magic and the help of the little Dragon King Oscar and the peculiar Shadow Puppet within him, Nian Bing had successfully passed the arduous test. However, the seven elders told him that as a Cult Master, he must possess the ability to lead the masses, and Nian Bing's current strength was clearly insufficient. Therefore, these days, Nian Bing had to spend a period of time equivalent to burning one Dragon Sky Incense under the combined attack of the seven elders. These attacks were different from the previous test. The seven elders required him not to use the Shadow Puppet's abilities. And Nian Bing, in order to improve his strength, no longer let Oscar help. Each tempering was a confrontation entirely relying on his innate domain and seven-element magic.\n\nThe burning time of one Dragon Sky Incense was only half an hour. Half an hour is neither too long nor too short, but this daily half an hour became Nian Bing's nightmare. How could he possibly contend with the combined attack abilities of the seven elders? Fortunately, the seven elders only pushed him to the point of losing all his abilities before stopping, and would not harm him. Otherwise, even ten Nian Bings would have perished. For a month, except for the test, Nian Bing had never been able to last until the Dragon Sky Incense was completely burnt. However, he was not discouraged and continued to strive.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"Without pressure, one is light and floats; pressure is also motivation.\" To cope with the daily tests of the seven elders, Nian Bing spent most of his time cultivating. With the effect of innate energy, his strength advanced by leaps and bounds. Although this period of time was not long, his realm had completely stabilized. Not only could he use tenth-order magic with the union of ice and fire, but he could also use other elements. The union of ice and fire could even attempt to use the top-tier forbidden spells of a Magic Seeker. However, he was afraid of harming the seven elders and had never tried. He could only confront the seven elders relying on his understanding of magic fusion. Under immense pressure, Nian Bing's various imaginative ideas in magic application emerged endlessly, making the seven elders increasingly satisfied with this young new Cult Master.",

    "content": "A slight smile, Nian Bing said, \"Elders, your combined attack formation is truly strange. I've tried various methods to find a breakthrough, but I can't find any opening. If you had used this formation during the test that day, I wouldn't have had a chance.\"\n\nThe Grand Elder smiled and said, \"Your Holiness doesn't need to be so modest. This combined attack method has been passed down from our ancestors and is the treasure of our Blood Lion Sect. According to regulations, this method cannot be used to test the new sect leader. Moreover, the various abilities used by the sect disciples when we first encountered you were extremely peculiar. At that time, we might not have been able to use this Blood Frenzy Formation.\"\n\nLooking at the seven calm elders, Nian Bing smiled and said, \"The current situation is proceeding according to our plan. Yan Feng's reputation has already begun to gradually increase.\"\n\nThe Grand Elder said, \"According to the information we've obtained, the First Prince has gained a significant advantage on the surface. It's just strange that the Fifth Prince has disappeared at this crucial moment. This doesn't seem reasonable. According to our spies planted in the Fifth Prince's mansion, the Fifth Prince has been very leisurely these days and shows no signs of urgency. There are only two possibilities for this situation: first, the Fifth Prince has decided to give up his pursuit of the throne; second, even if he still has any trump cards yet to be revealed, he is waiting for the best moment.\"\n\n\"Giving up the throne seems impossible, so only the second possibility remains. Grand Elder, we have thoroughly investigated the Fifth Prince's information. What other powerful reliance could he have?\" Nian Bing was also a little confused. Based on the information received in the past few days, the First Prince has not only accepted those who originally supported the Second Prince, but his own strength has also greatly increased due to the death of the Second Prince. Public opinion is very unfavorable to the Fifth Prince. He really doesn't understand why the Fifth Prince, who is so determined to claim the throne, is so inactive at such a critical moment.\n\nThe Second Elder, who rarely spoke, said, \"This is not hard to guess. If the Fifth Prince still has any reliance, then this reliance must be enough to push him onto the throne. We just need to think carefully about what he relies on to ascend the throne smoothly. In this regard, in the entire Ice Moon Empire, besides the King, there seems to be only one person who can do it.\"\n\n\"The Snow Goddess Priestess.\" Nian Bing and the Grand Elder simultaneously thought of the person the Second Elder was referring to. Their expressions couldn't help but darken. Yes! The Ice Moon Empire still has the powerful Snow Goddess Priestess. As long as she expresses her support for the Fifth Prince, even the King cannot object. The Snow Goddess Priestess has always been the guardian deity of the Ice Moon Empire. She has stepped forward many times in critical moments of the Ice Moon Empire, turning the tide at the brink of collapse. Her position in the Ice Moon Empire is unshakeable.\n\nThe Grand Elder shook his head and said, \"From my understanding of the Snow Goddess Priestess, she will not interfere in the political affairs of the Ice Moon Empire, nor has she ever contacted any of the princes. According to the news we received, the King of the Ice Moon Empire sent an envoy to the Ice God Tower to request an audience with the Snow Goddess Priestess, but the Snow Goddess Priestess has not shown any signs of leaving the Ice God Tower. Although our Blood Lion Sect is the largest underground force, we have tried many times to infiltrate the Ice God Tower, but we have never succeeded. Therefore, we do not know what is happening inside the Ice God Tower at the moment.\"\n\nA flash of light appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. \"Grand Elder, send more people to keep a close watch on the Ice God Tower. As soon as the Snow Goddess Priestess shows any signs of leaving the Ice God Tower, report it to me immediately. The movements of the Snow Goddess Priestess are the key to our current operation.\"\n\nThat day, after Xue Po and Yan Feng returned from the palace, they brought a very important message to Nian Bing. As one of the three marshals of the empire, Xue Po had immense influence in the military. Even the commander of the Royal Guard, who only obeyed the king, had a very good personal relationship with him. This time, he brought Yan Feng into the palace to ask Yan Tiannan to arrange a marriage for Yan Feng. Yan Tiannan was surprised but did not stop anything. He didn't think Yan Feng could stir up much trouble. He only subtly advised Xue Po a few words, hoping he wouldn't act rashly or make any hasty decisions. Before leaving the palace, the commander of the Royal Guard said one word to Xue Po, a very simple word: five.\n\n\"Five. This means the King is really going to pass his position to the Fifth Prince Yan Yun. Our judgment was not wrong. There is only one possibility for the Fifth Prince to inherit the throne now.\" Understanding the situation was very important to Nian Bing. He smiled slightly and nodded at Xue Po. \"Marshal, it seems we need to take action. Time is the most crucial factor for us.\"\n\nXue Po nodded and said, \"Yes. So many friends came to congratulate my daughter on her engagement last time. I must reciprocate. Yan Feng! You can come with me.\"\n\nYan Feng understood and nodded. \"Everything depends on my father-in-law's decision.\" The three looked at each other and smiled. The real action began today.\n\nNian Bing changed into a snow-white magic robe he had prepared earlier. The robe had no insignia. He pulled the hood over his head, put on a veil on his face like Bing Yun, and covered his face. He left the Marshal's mansion through a side door.\n\nWalking on the bustling streets of Ice Moon, Nian Bing's heart was calm. Gazing north, Snow Goddess Priestess, it seems we will meet soon. Can you really stop what I must do? Nian Bing walked unhurriedly. Although his appearance was a bit strange, he didn't attract too much attention from passersby. A white magic robe was much more ordinary than his golden magic robe.\n\n\"Brother Nian Bing.\" Mao Mao's voice suddenly sounded. Nian Bing turned his head and saw Mao Mao and Bing Yun, who was wearing a blue magic robe, walking out from another street. Seeing Mao Mao's satisfied expression, it was clear she had just finished eating. Bing Yun couldn't help but show a hint of surprise in her large eyes when she saw Nian Bing's attire. Nian Bing smiled and said, \"Mao Mao, can you recognize me even if I change my clothes?\"\n\nMao Mao giggled, \"Your clothes have changed, but your aura hasn't! Brother Nian Bing is so naughty. You haven't come to play with Mao Mao lately. Mao Mao is going to be angry.\"\n\nNian Bing rubbed Mao Mao's head dotingly. \"Brother has a lot to do recently. Isn't it the same if Sister Bing Yun is with you?\"\n\nMao Mao glanced at Bing Yun, who had walked over. \"Brother, what are you going to do dressed like this? You're not going to do anything bad, are you?\" Nian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Perhaps. But what brother is going to do is bad for some people, but good for others. Alright, remember to go back with Sister Bing Yun.\"\n\nBing Yun looked at Nian Bing coldly. \"You've been here long enough. How much longer do I have to wait?\" Nian Bing looked deeply at Bing Yun. \"Perhaps not too long. Isn't your master coming to Ice Moon City soon? With her strength, even if I'm unwilling, you can still capture me.\"\n\nBing Yun shook her head and said, \"I've promised Mao Mao. As long as she is here, I won't capture you. I will wait, but I hope it won't be for too long.\" With that, she pulled Mao Mao and headed towards the inn.\n\nNian Bing looked somewhat dazedly in the direction Bing Yun and the others left. His eyes flashed. What did she mean? Promised Mao Mao? He had a strange feeling, but Bing Yun's words did not disrupt his plan. What needed to be done had to be done. Thinking of this, he quickened his pace and walked towards his destination.\n\nFirst Prince's Mansion.\n\n\"Congratulations, Your Highness. Even Nusar, the commander of the Ice Moon City Guard, has submitted to you. Except for the royal palace, this entire Ice Moon City is now under your control.\" A thin man stood beside the First Prince and flattered him. This person was the First Prince's most trusted strategist, named Huai Xiao. Yan Ji liked to call him \"Bad Joke.\" Although Huai Xiao was not outstanding, he often came up with peculiar ideas for the First Prince and was deeply trusted by him. Today, the commander of the Ice Moon Guard, whom the First Prince had been trying to win over, was finally moved by the two prime virgin girls he sent. He secretly promised his allegiance. That was fifty thousand soldiers! Although it was not enough to completely grasp the situation in Ice Moon City, with his support, the First Prince's prestige instantly rose to a new level.\n\nListening to Huai Xiao's words, Yan Ji couldn't help but show a hint of pride. Due to the Fifth Prince Yan Yun's forbearance, his power had grown to the maximum extent, and inheriting the throne was within reach.\n\n\"Reporting to Your Highness, a mage in a white magic robe is outside requesting an audience. He is wearing a mask and cannot be seen.\"\n\nYan Ji frowned slightly. \"A strange person has come? Could it be sent by Yan Yun? We must be cautious at this time. I won't see him.\" \"Wait a moment.\" Just as the guard was about to leave, Huai Xiao stopped him. \"Did this person say he had a message to deliver?\"\n\nThe guard said, \"He said he represents Marshal Xue Po. The message can only be told to Your Highness alone.\"\n\nYan Ji was startled. \"Damn it, why didn't you say earlier that he represents Marshal Xue? Quickly invite him in!\" Xue Po had always been one of the people he most wanted to win over. Even if the person outside was an imposter, he couldn't take the risk. On important matters, Yan Ji always had his own ideas. While instructing his subordinates, he winked at Huai Xiao, who immediately understood and retreated.\n\nA moment later, led by the guard, Nian Bing, dressed in a white magic robe, arrived in the reception hall of the First Prince's mansion. The guard withdrew, leaving only Nian Bing in the hall.\n\nNian Bing casually looked around and couldn't help but be surprised. The First Prince's mansion was not as luxurious as he had imagined. Instead, it was very simple, with no extravagant decorations.\n\nWith a thought, Nian Bing turned around and saw a tall man walking in from outside. This man was wearing a bright yellow warrior uniform and looked somewhat heroic. His appearance bore some resemblance to Yan Feng and Yan Yun. Without a doubt, Nian Bing knew the person who had arrived was the First Prince of the Ice Moon Empire, Yan Ji. He looked deeply at Yan Ji, remaining silent. He realized that this First Prince was very steady. Although he didn't have the affinity of the Fifth Prince Yan Yun, he exuded a noble aura, especially his eyes, which looked exceptionally deep. Yan Ji, seeing that Nian Bing had not paid his respects, couldn't help but examine the person in front of him with surprise. Nian Bing, with his tall and straight posture, was about the same height as him. His broad shoulders and slender figure stood there, as if covered by a layer of airflow, making it impossible for Yan Ji to sense anything. It turned out that after being inspired by Mao Mao, Nian Bing had used his innate energy to protect himself and cover most of his aura to better conceal himself. Although Yan Ji was not weak, he could not see through this layer of innate energy.\n\n\"Your Excellency represents Marshal Xue?\" The First Prince stopped about ten feet away from Nian Bing. Nian Bing smiled indifferently and said, \"Indeed.\" \"Since that is the case, I presume Your Excellency is aware of the current situation in Ice Moon City. The situation is so tense, I must be careful. May I ask how Your Excellency can prove your identity?\"\n\nWith a flash of silver light in his hand, a diamond-shaped identification token appeared in Nian Bing's palm. \"I think this Soul Devouring Token should be able to prove my identity.\" Saying this, he threw the Soul Devouring Token over.\n\nThe First Prince took it and looked at the conspicuous skull mark on the Soul Devouring Token, then at the inlaid gem on the back of the token. \"Indeed, this is Marshal Xue's Soul Devouring Token. Since that is the case, Your Excellency can now state your purpose. I heard from my subordinate that you came to deliver a message.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"I am a distinguished guest in Marshal Xue's mansion. I will speak when the time is right. However, Your Highness does not seem to have the sincerity to listen to me.\" Yan Ji said, \"Why does Sir say that?\" After confirming Nian Bing's identity, his tone became much more polite.\n\nNian Bing looked at Yan Ji calmly and said, \"If Your Highness were sincere, there wouldn't be four Martial Saint level experts hidden in this study.\"\n\nYan Ji was greatly shocked. Indeed, in the secret rooms around this study were his most valued four distinguished guests. These four Martial Saint level experts were invited with considerable effort. They were also one of his most important bargaining chips in the competition for the throne with Yan Yun. Yan Yun had the protection of two Martial Saints, but he had four. His strength surpassed that of all other princes.\n\nSeeing the surprise on Yan Ji's face, Nian Bing smiled slightly. \"I just want to prove to Your Highness that the distinguished guests in Marshal Xue's mansion are not incompetent. The Sky Eye acupoint is used to detect the surrounding situation. Let alone Martial Saints, even Divine Masters would be sensed by me.\"",

    "content": "Yan Ji hesitated before saying, \"Sir, you must know about my second brother's misfortune. I had to be cautious before confirming your identity. Since you represent Marshal Xue, that caution is naturally unnecessary.\" He waved his hand, and the four hidden Martial Saints quietly withdrew.\n\nNian Bing couldn't help but reveal a trace of admiration in his eyes. This First Prince, in order to contend for the throne with the Fifth Prince Yan Yun, indeed had his own outstanding qualities. At least, he displayed a magnanimous side. \"I may have overstepped, but the First Prince should know the saying 'the law is not transmitted to six ears.' The message can only be conveyed to you alone. Currently, judging by the situation, the First Prince has the upper hand in the struggle for the throne, isn't that right?\"\n\nYan Ji smiled slightly and said, \"It's not entirely accurate to say that, but if I could gain Marshal Xue's support, I, Yan Ji, would have a few more chances.\"\n\nNian Bing walked to a nearby chair and sat down, saying calmly, \"Your Highness needn't be modest. Judging by the surface situation alone, even without Marshal Xue's support, Your Highness is quite confident. However, have you considered a problem? The Fifth Prince has been contending for the throne with you and the Second Prince, but recently he has been very low-key, as if he has given up.\"\n\nYan Ji's brows furrowed. \"He sent people to kill my second brother. I wish he would step forward. My second brother and I share the same mother. I must avenge him.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"Things are not that simple. As far as I know, His Majesty has always favored the Fifth Prince. If His Majesty were to order that this matter not be pursued further, or to clear the Fifth Prince's name, even if the First Prince had the intention to act, it would be difficult to pose a threat to the Fifth Prince. Although His Majesty is gravely ill, I believe his inaction is not because he is unwell.\"\n\nYan Ji was startled. He had been progressing smoothly these past few days and had indeed become somewhat careless. Hearing Nian Bing's words, he felt a sense of foreboding. He quickly walked over and sat beside Nian Bing, saying, \"I still ask for Sir's guidance.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"The First Prince is a wise man, so I don't need to say much. The message I brought today has only six words.\"\n\nYan Ji pressed, \"What six words?\"\n\nNian Bing said word by word, \"Ice – Snow – Goddess – Sacrifice –\"\n\nWith a \"boom,\" Yan Ji's mind felt as if it had exploded. He immediately understood the source of his foreboding. Yes! How could he have forgotten such an important person? He slapped the table suddenly and stood up again, angrily saying, \"Damn it.\"\n\nNian Bing also stood up. \"The message has been delivered. I should be going. First Prince, farewell.\" With that, he turned and walked towards the outside.\n\n\"Sir, please stay.\" Yan Ji quickly called out to Nian Bing and rushed behind him. \"Sir came to deliver a message to Yan Ji, how can you leave without eating? Yan Ji was truly remiss earlier.\"\n\nNian Bing turned around, looked at Yan Ji, and smiled slightly. \"First Prince, I know you may still have some doubts, perhaps even question my sincerity. I am not in a hurry, but time waits for no one. Once that person arrives in Ice Moon City, it will likely be too late to take any action. Please consider it carefully. Marshal Xue is also a wise man. He would never wish to stand on the wrong side.\"\n\nYan Ji understood the implication of Nian Bing's words. \"Sir, what are Marshal Xue's demands? As long as I can fulfill them, I will agree.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Actually, this matter is nothing much; for the First Prince, it's just a matter of raising a hand. Originally, the Marshal did not intend to express his stance so early, but a troublesome matter has recently arisen that forced him to act ahead of schedule. Perhaps you already know that the Seventh Prince, your brother, is soon to be married to Miss Xue Yu, Marshal Xue's only daughter. The Marshal is very helpless about this matter. However, the Seventh Prince is already his son-in-law, so he hopes his son-in-law can conduct himself honorably. At the same time, he must also consider the future of his daughter and son-in-law.\"\n\nYan Ji's heart relaxed, and he nodded. \"I can understand the Marshal's feelings. This matter is easy to handle. I will immediately mobilize people to clear up those rumors for my seventh brother. I had already planned to do so, but there were too many matters, and I haven't had the time. Since Sir has reminded me, Yan Ji will certainly handle this properly. If, in the future, Yan Ji is fortunate enough to become... my seventh brother is my own brother, and granting him a fiefdom is only natural.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"The First Prince is indeed a straightforward person. I believe you will become a great ruler. I will await your arrival at the Marshal's mansion.\" With that, he walked outside again. This time, Yan Ji did not stop Nian Bing again. He escorted him to the entrance of the mansion and watched him head towards the Marshal's mansion.\n\nReturning to his study, Huai Xiao was already waiting for him. Yan Ji said, \"You heard our conversation just now. What do you think?\" Although the four Martial Saints had withdrawn, Huai Xiao had remained hidden nearby. Nian Bing had not exposed him, and Yan Ji had not asked Huai Xiao to leave.\n\nHuai Xiao said, \"There is no doubt that this person is from Marshal Xue Po. I just inquired from a few guest scholars, and they all said they could not discern this person's depth of strength. I did not expect there to be such a distinguished guest in Marshal Xue Po's mansion. We are also well aware of the matter concerning the Seventh Prince. On the surface, there is no flaw. It's just that I am very curious, what ability does Marshal Xue Po have to contend with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess? However, Your Highness, to be frank, even if we know this is a trap, we must walk into it. Alas, it's all my fault for forgetting such an important person as the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess.\"\n\nYan Ji did not respond and continued to ask, \"I want to hear your opinion on the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess.\"\n\nHuai Xiao thought for a moment and said, \"The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess is a supreme being in our country. Especially in times of peace, she is the true guardian deity. Although she does not obey royal commands, if our country faces danger, she will never stand idly by. Given the status of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, she would never be bribed by anyone. The succession of emperors is a major event. I believe that if His Majesty requests the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess to recognize the Fifth Prince, she should refuse. At that point, the Fifth Prince would have the support of the entire Ice God Tower. Even if we have more people, we cannot contend with a Divine Descendant who can easily destroy a hundred thousand troops! The Ice God Tower has so many magic experts. The decision of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess can indeed affect the entire situation.\"\n\nYan Ji nodded and said, \"It seems we must prepare for the worst. Father, oh Father, you are so partial. I am clearly your eldest son, yet you insist on this. Since you are benevolent, do not blame me for being unrighteous. Contact Commander Nussar for me. I want to meet him. At the same time, prepare generous gifts. Tomorrow morning, I will personally visit Marshal Xue Po's mansion.\" He had thought it through carefully. Given Yan Tiannan's usual attitude towards him, it was impossible for him to get the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess to support him. And the reason for Yan Yun's forbearance during this period was naturally present. Although Nian Bing had not spoken much with him, he had enlightened him. He knew he had to do something, otherwise, once the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess arrived in Ice Moon City, as Nian Bing said, there would be no more opportunities.\n\nMarshal Xue Po's mansion. Nian Bing sat alone on the roof of his small dwelling, gazing at the sky. It had been a full month since he arrived in Ice Moon City. It was rare to have such leisure time. Usually, at this time, he would have begun cultivating. For some reason, he felt a bit restless today. He used wind magic to send himself to the roof and lay there, letting the cold wind blow against his body, enjoying the quiet night.\n\nThe sky was clear today, with not a single cloud in the night sky. The bright crescent moon was drawn into a perfect crescent, appearing so pure against the backdrop of the many bright stars.\n\nNian Bing first thought of Feng Nu. Her pink hair, like flames, gave him a burning sensation. Every time he thought of her, his heart was filled with the urge to find her. Feng Nu, are you well now? Have you recognized your foster mother? If your foster mother knew you were her eldest daughter, she would surely be very happy. Perhaps you have already gone to the Phoenix tribe. We don't know when we will meet again. Just as I can give up revenge, you also cannot give up the Phoenix tribe. When I finish my affairs, I will definitely come to Oran City to find you.\n\nAfter Feng Nu, Nian Bing thought of Long Ling. The deepest impression Long Ling left on him was her gentle, water-like eyes. Those clear eyes always exuded a gentle radiance that calmed his heart. Although he had done so many things since coming to Ice Moon City, and he didn't know if he could successfully complete everything in the end, Nian Bing did not regret it. Because all he was doing was for Ling'er. For Ling'er, what was the point of paying any more? Ling'er! I hope to see your gentle smile, your heartfelt smile, forever and ever!\n\nThe wind carried the cold. The night wind was even more piercing than during the day. Although Nian Bing did not deliberately resist, his Heavenly Eye domain still emitted a faint layer of energy protection outside his skin, preventing the cold from invading. His Ice-Fire Dual Origin magic had already reached great mastery, and he no longer had to worry about potential conflicts between ice and fire. This bit of cold posed no threat to him.\n\nThe icy feeling made Nian Bing exceptionally clear-headed. He slowly closed his eyes, concentrated his spiritual power on his Heavenly Eye acupoint, and looked outwards through it. The dark sky turned deep blue under the observation of his Heavenly Eye acupoint, and the stars became exceptionally clear. Suddenly, Nian Bing's heart stirred. Through the Heavenly Eye acupoint, he actually saw strong energy fluctuations occurring within the starlight and moonlight. With each energy fluctuation, the starlight would tremble slightly. Watching this strange phenomenon, Nian Bing felt as if everything around him was gently oscillating, and even the magic power within his body trembled. With each tremor, the innate energy in the air would surge into his body. Although this did not strengthen his magic power, the strange and wonderful feeling made Nian Bing's body incredibly comfortable. He did nothing deliberately, merely maintaining that subtle feeling. The innate energy that surged into his body, unlike before, did not require filtering by his body's energy. It was inherently pure, quietly integrating into every inch of his meridians, and then combining with his magic power. The magic elements in the air rushed towards Nian Bing's body like a lover embracing him, and Nian Bing's body absorbed these magic elements like a magnet, filling his body. The magic elements that entered his body along with the innate energy were completely purified, and could be easily converted for Nian Bing's use without further cultivation. Just then, the gray energy in Nian Bing's chest dispersed, spreading throughout his body. Oscar's excited voice rang out, \"Holy crap, boss, this works too.\"\n\nThrough their soul connection, Nian Bing asked somewhat surprisedly, \"Kaka, what's wrong? Did you discover something? The innate energy in the air today seems richer and purer than before.\"\n\nOscar excitedly said, \"Boss! This is no ordinary innate energy, but innate energy mixed with the essence of heaven and earth! How did you do it? It's too magical. This kind of innate energy is extremely beneficial to any cultivator. I want to absorb more, maybe I can evolve early. It feels so comfortable, so incredibly comfortable! Sharing a body with you is truly great.\"\n\nNian Bing recalled what Fatty, the Earth Dragon King, had said. All along, he knew that the opening of his Heavenly Eye acupoint had completely changed his cultivation, but only now did he truly understand why the Heavenly Eye acupoint was the most important of the seven major acupoints. Its opening brought him increasing benefits, as if his body was being transformed because of its opening. Fatty said that the Heavenly Eye acupoint was the \"Spirit Acupoint\" among the seven major acupoints. It did not enhance strength but improved learning and adaptation abilities. Only through continuous cultivation could the function of the Heavenly Eye acupoint be fully utilized. The Heavenly Eye acupoint itself was like a vast treasure trove; only by continuously excavating could more wondrous treasures be discovered.\n\nFeeling the increase in his body's energy and the changes in his body, Nian Bing's heart became even more peaceful. He continued to look at the starry sky through his Heavenly Eye acupoint. Gradually, the Heavenly Eye acupoint became blurred, and Nian Bing entered a wondrous realm, as if his body had merged with the starlight in the sky, as if his spirit had become a part of the starlight. In a daze, he saw a blurry figure in the starry sky. That figure seemed to be composed of starlight, and in the chest area of that figure was the crescent moon.\n\nThe light of the crescent moon gradually accelerated its changes, moving up and down continuously. Suddenly, during its movement, the crescent moon surprisingly transformed into a vertical beam of white light. Immediately after, it began to condense continuously, converging to a single point. The location of the condensation was precisely below the chest.",

    "content": "Suddenly, Nian Bing's entire body trembled. The blurry images before his eyes instantly cleared. What he saw through his Celestial Eye acupoint was actually a manifestation of himself condensed entirely from starlight. Just as he was astonished, the Innate Qi he had absorbed into his body during this period began to separate from his body, even the portion he had just absorbed. Nian Bing was horrified and wanted to deactivate this peculiar state, but he discovered that his spiritual power was firmly sealed within the Celestial Eye acupoint, temporarily losing control of his body. He couldn't even call upon Oscar for help through the Spirit Elixir.\n\nThe Innate Qi surged out madly, giving Nian Bing a feeling of being drained. His bodily aura weakened continuously, and the peculiar sensation from the Innate realm vanished. Stranger still, Oscar, who was absorbing the essence of heaven and earth, seemed oblivious to Nian Bing's current situation. Nian Bing's magical power within his body was also unaffected by the expulsion of Innate Qi, circulating naturally as usual.\n\nAlong with the Innate Qi, Nian Bing's own aura also left his body. A suffocating feeling kept coming, and Nian Bing felt his body alternately cold and hot, as if he had returned to the sensation he experienced when he was first buried underground. However, this time the feeling was even more intense. Extreme cold and heat caused illusions to flood his mind, but oddly, his brain remained exceptionally clear. Through the Celestial Eye acupoint, he could still see the starlight-condensed version of himself. The body formed of starlight, except for the waxing crescent moon on his chest that was condensing into a point of white light, was golden everywhere else. A faint golden hue emitted a soft glow, appearing even clearer under the observation of the Celestial Eye acupoint.\n\nThe Innate Qi drawn out of his body turned into wisps of white light, flowing into the starlight-condensed body. As the white Innate Qi came into contact with the starlight-condensed body, streaks of starlight ignited, refining the white Innate Qi. The refined Innate Qi transformed into even smaller streams of golden energy that directly merged into the starlight-condensed body.\n\nAs the aura within his body grew increasingly sparse, Nian Bing's spiritual power was under immense stimulation, and dazzling lights flashed before his eyes. He desperately tried to control his spiritual power to surge out of the Celestial Eye acupoint, but the Celestial Eye acupoint was like a solid cage, immovably confining his spiritual power, as if a sturdy shackle had been placed outside the Celestial Eye acupoint. The intense pain caused his spiritual power to fluctuate continuously. However, the light seen by the Celestial Eye acupoint became clearer as his spiritual power churned in pain.\n\nNian Bing did not understand what was happening. He had lost the ability to think, and all his spiritual power was engaged in a struggle against the intense pain. He tried to condense his spiritual power into a single point, constantly impacting the Celestial Eye acupoint, attempting to regain control of his body. He had gone through so much hardship to achieve what he had today and absolutely did not want to lose everything due to a qi deviation.\n\nHowever, the sturdiness of the Celestial Eye acupoint far exceeded Nian Bing's estimation. The milky white space around him made him feel as if he had returned to the time when his soul and body were separated. But even during that time, it wasn't this painful! The hellish environment was driving Nian Bing mad. If not for the resilient character he had cultivated since childhood, he would likely have been unable to endure such intense pain long ago.\n\nFinally, the last wisp of aura in his body left Nian Bing. At that moment, the pain in Nian Bing's body surged to its peak. His spiritual power felt as if it would explode. Amidst the intense pain, it surged towards every corner of the Celestial Eye acupoint simultaneously. However, his spiritual power encountered a resilient, elastic barrier. The spiritual power was suddenly repelled back at an even faster speed, condensing into a point in the center of the Celestial Eye acupoint. Nian Bing felt a deafening roar within his spiritual world, and then his consciousness fell into a brief blankness.\n\nAlthough he lost consciousness, Nian Bing's subconscious felt exceptionally comfortable. It wasn't true comfort, but rather because, having temporarily lost consciousness, he could no longer feel the pain. Escaping the overwhelmingly intense pain was inherently a comfortable thing. After the preceding suffering, Nian Bing no longer even wished to regain consciousness; at least this way, he wouldn't be in pain.\n\nHowever, the loss of consciousness only lasted for a few seconds. He regained clarity of the outside world through the Celestial Eye acupoint. He was surprised to find that everything he saw through his Celestial Eye appeared even clearer than before. With just a thought, his spiritual power seemed to surge out of the Celestial Eye acupoint. Focusing inwardly, something even more astonishing happened. The spiritual power that was originally within the Celestial Eye acupoint had transformed into a small figure, only an inch tall, floating vertically within the white sea of the Celestial Eye acupoint with its arms spread wide. That energy-form figure, wasn't it himself?\n\nWith a thought, the golden figure condensed from spiritual power raised its right arm. Strangely, Nian Bing's physical body also raised its right arm. There was no gap at all; the movements of spirit and body were perfectly synchronized. A flash of inspiration struck Nian Bing. He vaguely understood that his spiritual power had entered another realm.\n\nThe ability of the Celestial Eye acupoint had clearly improved. For everyone, regardless of how they controlled their bodies, there was a brief interval between the body's reaction and the spirit's intent. Although this interval was negligible for ordinary people, it was extremely important for a mage or a warrior, especially when controlling magic and battle qi. Even a slight difference could produce different results. Nian Bing vaguely felt that what he understood was only the surface phenomenon; this figure condensed from spiritual power was definitely not that simple.\n\nThe pain had disappeared, and Nian Bing became much calmer. There was still no aura within his body, but he found that he felt no discomfort, as if his body no longer belonged to him. Focusing outward, he once again saw everything outside through the Celestial Eye acupoint. The figure composed of starlight, exactly like himself, still floated quietly in the sky. However, the gaps between the starlight were now gone, and the white light condensed from the waxing moon had become a point of white light. Looking at the point of white light below his chest, Nian Bing suddenly had a strange feeling. He thought of something, but couldn't recall it clearly. He just felt that the position of the white light point was peculiar and seemed to have an important connection to his cultivation.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was contemplating everything that was happening before him, the golden figure suddenly grew larger. When he focused his attention, he realized that the figure wasn't growing bigger, but rather seemed to be getting closer to him. Suddenly, the golden figure moved instantaneously. Before Nian Bing could react, he felt a \"boom\"—\n\nHis body felt as if it were flying. A vast amount of Innate Qi, unlike anything he had ever felt before, surged into his body like a thousand rivers flowing into the sea.\n\nOscar's gray energy, originally dispersed throughout Nian Bing's body, was instantly forced to retract to his heart by the suddenly surging, wild Innate Qi. Nian Bing's body completely transformed into a golden world. A cool sensation came from the Celestial Eye acupoint between his eyebrows. Nian Bing watched as a point of white light surged into his body, rapidly sinking. In the blink of an eye, it broke through the barrier of the Celestial Eye acupoint and sank into his body.\n\nNian Bing wanted to ask Oscar if he had been harmed, but he found that after his spiritual power transformed into its new form, although he could control his body again, he was still unable to contact Oscar.\n\nLight flashed, and the white point of light quickly sank to the same position as the starlight-condensed body that Nian Bing had previously seen, just below his chest. The moment the white light paused, the Innate Qi that was surging wildly into Nian Bing's body seemed to find a vent and poured madly towards that milky white point. Nian Bing clearly felt as if a mountain was pressing down on his chest, making it difficult to breathe. The Innate Qi was truly immense. He didn't know where this Innate Qi came from, but he found that it did not conflict with his body in any way. That milky white point seemed to be an infinite void; no matter how much Innate Qi poured in, it would absorb it madly. Suddenly, Nian Bing thought of something. He finally understood the source of his peculiar feeling. Ecstasy instantly filled his spiritual world, and he couldn't help but sigh in his heart, \"My luck is truly good; even this is working out.\"\n\nThe immense pressure no longer made him feel uncomfortable. Nian Bing focused all his spiritual power, urging his magical power to circulate even faster, resisting the enormous pressure. His chest bones seemed to creak under the strain. Nian Bing's heart was cheering. The vast Heavenly Qi could no longer cause him any psychological burden. He was now afraid of not having enough Innate Qi, secretly thinking, \"Let the storm come even harder!\"\n\nAs if hearing Nian Bing's call, the Innate Qi surged in even faster, and the resulting pressure became even greater. Although Nian Bing's magical power could provide some relief, his body was still trembling incessantly on the rooftop. If anyone could see him at this moment, they would clearly see—\n\nA golden sun, imbued with inner light, was flickering on Nian Bing's chest, emitting a faint glow.\n\nNian Bing was waiting. Waiting for that moment to arrive. Due to the immense pressure, blood started seeping from every pore of his body. In reality, he didn't know that he was currently in a very dangerous stage. For an ordinary person to break through the realm he was about to enter would require at least fifty years of cultivation, not only to strengthen their own body but also to strengthen their spiritual power. However, through a fortunate coincidence, he had received the assistance of opportune timing. Under the effect of the Celestial Eye acupoint, he had gained the ability to absorb the essence of heaven and earth—the purest Innate Qi! But if he had an ordinary human body, the sudden influx of such immense Innate Qi would inevitably tear his body apart. Let alone improving his strength, even preserving his life would become impossible.\n\nPerhaps, as Nian Bing imagined, his luck was indeed exceptional. In the past, to protect the Seven Dragon Kings, he had nearly lost his life, leading to the fusion of his Dragon Soul with Oscar's, completely remodeling his frail human body and giving him the physique of a dragon. This allowed him to withstand the immense impact of the Innate Qi under such circumstances without collapsing. At the same time, the evolution of the Celestial Eye acupoint had granted him enough spiritual power to withstand the impact of the Innate Qi, enabling him to try his best to support his body with his magical power while remaining conscious.\n\nWhat the Celestial Eye acupoint could see at this moment was only a golden ocean, and what it could feel was only the immeasurably vast Innate Qi. Nian Bing's entire skeletal structure was trembling, his meridians were twisting, and the blood in his body had even stopped flowing. The incomparably massive Innate Qi continued to surge madly towards the point emitting white light, dyeing the white point golden.\n\nFinally, just as Nian Bing's resilient spiritual power was about to succumb to the immense pressure, the Innate Qi that had been surging wildly began to weaken. However, the feeling of pressure in his chest intensified instead of decreasing. Nian Bing's body contorted in pain. The remaining Innate Qi circled his body once, then transformed into a sharp cone, delivering one last violent impact towards his chest.\n\n*Crack.* A sound like shattering glass echoed. Nian Bing's body suddenly froze. Immediately after, the golden sun on his chest, after a sequence of transitions from gold to white, and then from white back to gold, Nian Bing's body actually floated up from the rooftop. With a \"boom,\" golden light scattered in all directions. The light of the stars and moon in the sky seemed to have dimmed considerably at this moment. However, the golden light emanating from Nian Bing's body only traveled about ten feet before being blocked by a layer of colorful halo. His horizontal body gradually stood up and slowly landed on the rooftop. His previously closed eyes slowly opened, and two substantial beams of golden light shot out from his cerulean eyes. The Celestial Eye acupoint in the center of his brow had actually become an eye, a silver eye. The purple pupils within the silver eyes flickered with a hint of an eerie radiance. At this moment, the clothes on his chest had completely vanished. About an inch and a half below his chest, a golden sun, the size of a fist, was gradually shrinking, stopping only when it became as small as a fingernail. However, in the places it had passed through during its contraction, spiral-like patterns remained, faintly shimmering as if they were rays of light emanating from the sun. The muscles of Nian Bing's chest were covered by a layer of golden light. With a flash of light, a beam of golden light shot out. The golden light continuously solidified in the air. After shooting out for a distance of thirty feet, it had already become as thin as a needle. This needle-like energy penetrated all obstacles at parallel height, disappearing in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe golden light in Nian Bing's eyes gradually weakened, and the radiance of the colored sun on his chest also dimmed significantly. The Celestial Eye acupoint on his brow slowly closed, leaving only a bean-sized silver point of light. He smiled, a smile of pure, heartfelt excitement. He had succeeded. He had actually succeeded. Among the seven most mysterious acupoints of the human body, he had opened the second one in such a short period – the Li Zhong acupoint.",

    "content": "The Fatty had told him that the Li Zhong acupoint was located below the thoracic vertebrae, at the center. Nian Bing was completely certain that, under a strange circumstance, he had actually reached the strength of possessing two acupoints. He didn't know how much progress he had made, nor did he worry about what having opened two acupoints meant. Nian Bing's smile grew even wider, because at that moment, he thought of the Ice Goddess Priestess, who was known as the continent's only Divine Descender, and she also only had two acupoints opened. Even compared to the Divine Continent, ordinary Divine Beings probably couldn't have two acupoints at this level. In a sense, could he also be considered a god?\n\n...\n\nIn the Cold Ridge, the Dragon Kings who were cultivating together simultaneously opened their eyes. In their gazes, there was a flickering of uncertain light. Among them, the most obvious was the Light Dragon King Dimanteti.\n\n\"Did you all feel it too?\" Dimanteti asked tentatively.\n\nKajeksios nodded and said, \"Yes, I felt it. It's our child! My feeling is very clear.\"\n\nDimanteti worriedly said, \"I don't know if I should be happy or worried.\"\n\nThe Space Dragon King Kao'diis chuckled and said, \"Of course, you should be happy. To be able to produce energy fluctuations that alert us, your child must have made great progress. Perhaps he is about to undergo his second evolution.\"\n\nKajeksios's eyes flashed, and he snorted, \"Kao'diis, watch your words. If I hear you call our child a freak one more time, I will challenge you in the name of the Dark Dragon King.\"\n\nThe smile on Kao'diis's face froze, and he quickly waved his hands, saying, \"Boss. I, I was just joking. However, considering the time, even if Oscar had some fortunate encounter, it wouldn't be so easy for him to undergo his second evolution. But just now, I clearly felt a great change in his energy. What could be the reason for this?\"\n\nDimanteti said with a wry smile, \"Kaka's situation is extremely special. Let alone us, even the Dragon God might not know what's happening. Increased energy is always a good thing, right? He's with Nian Bing, and Galadentis is by his side. There shouldn't be any problems.\" She didn't know that Galadentis was not with Nian Bing and the others at this time; he was striving continuously for his lifelong happiness.\n\nKajeksios nodded and said, \"There shouldn't be any problems. Alright, let's continue cultivating. I think Galadentis will send back the situation from their side soon.\"\n\nThe six Dragon Kings closed their eyes again and continued their cultivation. In recent days, the one who had made the most progress was undoubtedly the Dark Dragon King, who had obtained the Dragon God's Heart Technique. Relying on his powerful strength that had always surpassed the other Dragon Kings, he had cultivated the Dragon God's Heart Technique to the second level. Earlier, he had felt Oscar's energy fluctuations most profoundly. At the same time, he was surprised to find that the energy fluctuations produced by his son were very similar to his own in some ways. It seemed to be a calling-like energy. He vaguely felt something but couldn't be sure. Even if he were sure, he hadn't figured out how to voice his doubts. After all, it was his son! If he really...\n\n...\n\n\"Kaka, Kaka, are you alright?\" As soon as Nian Bing's energy stabilized, he immediately called out to Oscar.\n\nOscar's voice, unlike before, didn't always carry emotional color. He calmly said, \"Don't worry, I'm fine.\"\n\nNian Bing was a little worried. \"We lost contact just now, and that primordial energy was so immense. Did it really not have any effect on you?\"\n\nOscar's voice carried a hint of a smile, reassuring Nian Bing. \"Did it have an effect? Of course, it did. But if I could have such an effect often, I would be very happy. Nian Bing, I really don't know what kind of human you are. How come you get all the good things? However, this isn't entirely a good thing. If I weren't here, you probably would have been finished.\"\n\nNian Bing, not fully understanding what had happened to him, quickly asked after hearing Oscar's words, \"What exactly happened just now? My mental power underwent a great change, and my body also seemed to have broken through another acupoint. I don't know if my feeling is correct.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, it's correct. The knowledge I obtained from my father's memories tells me that you just broke through the Li Zhong acupoint, one of the seven major acupoints of humanity. This acupoint is very useful. But do you know how dangerous it was just now? The sudden surge of primordial energy was something your body fundamentally couldn't withstand. Even though my modification of your body made its toughness not inferior to that of ordinary dragons, it still couldn't withstand the primordial energy that came from within!\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred. \"You protected me?\"\n\nOscar chuckled and said, \"Of course, it was me. We use the same body. If you were finished, wouldn't I also be finished? I don't fully understand how you did it, but it seems that the primordial energy within your body reached a certain level, and under that peculiar situation just now, it utilized the Tian Yan acupoint to draw in the purest primordial energy from heaven and earth, using the essence of the sun and moon as a guide to input it into your body, which is what caused the change just now. It is extremely difficult for every acupoint in the human body to break through. The opening of your Tian Yan acupoint probably involves luck, and this Li Zhong acupoint requires extremely immense energy to possibly break through. You suddenly absorbed enough primordial energy to open the Li Zhong acupoint. If I hadn't protected you, it would be a miracle if you didn't die. Now that you've succeeded, even I have gained quite a bit of benefit. That primordial energy just now was so pure! The taste of the sun and moon essence was simply marvelous. After that energy broke through your Li Zhong acupoint, there was still a lot of residue left. Fortunately, they were no longer so violent, so I absorbed them into my own energy. I didn't expect that it would help me complete the second level of the Dragon God's Heart Technique. Now, I can begin cultivating the third level, haha, I wonder if my old man is as fast as me.\" He didn't know that it was precisely because he broke through too quickly that it had already attracted the attention of the Seven Dragon Kings. Fortunately, Nian Bing timely used his Tian Yan domain to prevent the light from leaking after the Li Zhong acupoint was opened, thus preventing the Dark Dragon King Kajeksios from truly realizing that he was secretly learning the Dragon God's Heart Technique.\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Great! Then I really have to thank you. Oscar, in the memories you obtained, is there any experience regarding the application of this Li Zhong acupoint? My Li Zhong acupoint has been opened now, and in theory, my strength should have greatly improved. Perhaps I can now contend with that Ice Goddess Priestess.\"\n\nOscar said with a hint of disdain, \"Don't dream. Do you think opening an acupoint can make you a Divine Descender? It's not that easy. There's no such thing as getting something for nothing in the world. You still need to keep working hard.\"\n\nNian Bing was confused. \"Why? Doesn't the Ice Goddess Priestess also only have two acupoints opened?\"\n\nOscar said, \"It's not as simple as you think. The memories I obtained show that acupoints also have different realms. Each acupoint must undergo evolution to truly unleash its greatest potential. The formation of an acupoint is the first evolution, also called opening. Then, after a period of cultivation, it will enter the second stage. Only at this second stage can you be considered to truly use this acupoint, and at this time, your acupoint will be considered to be in the middle stage. To fully unlock the acupoint's abilities, you must wait until the third stage, the ultimate. Opening an acupoint is undoubtedly the most difficult, but it's not easy to evolve an acupoint to the ultimate. The more powerful an acupoint's potential, the more difficult the process of evolution will be. Among them, the evolution of the Tian Yan acupoint is the most difficult, followed by the Huang Ji acupoint. You've already been lucky enough, and under these strange circumstances today, you've actually evolved your Tian Yan acupoint to the middle stage and opened the Li Zhong acupoint. For human cultivators like you, this is almost unimaginable. Such a thing has never happened even in the Divine Continent. One acupoint evolving while simultaneously opening another acupoint, what more can you be greedy for?\"\n\nNian Bing said with a wry smile, \"I'm not greedy! I just thought that having opened two acupoints, I should be able to contend with the Ice Goddess Priestess. As you know, how desperately I long to get real news about my parents.\"\n\nOscar said, \"Actually, what I obtained is only part of my father's memories. At that time, I was too playful and didn't remember much. So, I don't know how to use the Li Zhong acupoint. When you meet Uncle Galadentis, you can ask him. However, after my judgment, I can guess that the acupoint opening time of that so-called Ice Goddess Priestess is likely much longer than yours, and I am almost certain that her opened acupoints do not include the Tian Yan acupoint. Although the Tian Yan acupoint is the best among the seven major acupoints, it is also the only one among the seven major acupoints that can directly increase offensive power. The Ice Goddess Priestess has two offensive acupoints opened, and it's very likely that both have evolved to the middle stage. Coupled with her much stronger magic power than yours, even if you have the Primordial Domain and various strange control methods, you probably can't contend with her. You should be more rational. Your current conditions are already very good. As long as you continue to work hard, with the Tian Yan acupoint as your foundation, you will one day surpass that old woman.\"\n\nTaking a deep breath, the cool air made Nian Bing feel much more comfortable. He nodded slightly and said, \"Kaka, you're right. I was indeed too impatient. I was so happy when the Li Zhong acupoint was opened just now. I even thought about going to find the Ice Goddess Priestess for revenge immediately. Sigh, I'm still not mature enough! Don't worry, this kind of situation won't happen again. Let's work hard together and create more miracles.\"\n\nOscar chuckled and said, \"Are you blaming me for discouraging you? Actually, opening the Li Zhong acupoint should be very beneficial to you. It's a shame you can't fully understand its use yet, otherwise, it would be even better. Although you definitely can't beat that woman, at least you'll have some self-preservation ability. Nian Bing, I remember you have a talent for making magic scrolls. Why not make some space-element magic scrolls? You can run away when you're fighting.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes lit up. He immediately thought of a loophole in his plans from the past few days. \"Ah! That's great, Kaka, thank you. This time, it's finally perfect. I can also deal with the Ice Goddess Priestess with peace of mind. Actually, even if my strength could already contend with her, now is not the time to settle the score with her. She still has considerable use value for us.\" Thinking of this, Nian Bing gently touched the position of the Li Zhong acupoint. The faint golden patterns gave him a warm feeling. His thoughts were already racing, constantly analyzing potential loopholes in his overall plan.\n\nIn the early morning, the crisp chirping of birds, accompanied by the slowly rising sun, announced the arrival of a new day. Early in the morning, the Marshal's Mansion welcomed a distinguished guest. The Grand Prince Yan Ji, leading dozens of his subordinates, came to visit Xue Po, one of the empire's three great marshals, known as the \"Blood-Devouring Soul-Extinguisher.\"\n\nUpon receiving the news, Xue Po immediately came out to greet him personally. With him was his quasi-son-in-law, Yan Feng, the former most useless and most looked-down-upon Seventh Prince of the Ice Moon Empire.\n\n\"Marshal Xue, I apologize for disturbing you so early. Seventh Brother, you're here too!\" Yan Ji stepped forward and affectionately patted Yan Feng's shoulder. At this moment, he looked like a caring elder brother.\n\nYan Feng sneered inwardly, but outwardly, he showed no dissatisfaction. He smiled and said, \"Big Brother, you're up early too! I just arrived myself.\"\n\nXue Po said, \"Your Highness, please come inside.\" Saying this, he made a gesture of invitation. Everyone followed Xue Po into the living room. Yan Ji pointed to the two large boxes that his subordinates were carrying and smiled, \"Just some trinkets, not worthy of your attention. Please accept them, Marshal Xue.\"\n\nXue Po's brows furrowed slightly. \"Your Highness, this may not be appropriate.\"\n\nYan Ji glanced at Yan Feng beside him and smiled. \"What's inappropriate about it? The gift I sent last time was just a congratulatory gift. But Seventh Brother is my own brother, so as an elder brother, I naturally have to prepare some betrothal gifts for Seventh Brother. These are prepared by me for Seventh Brother, so please don't be polite, Marshal.\"\n\nXue Po looked at the surprised Yan Feng and smiled. \"Very well, thank you, Your Highness.\"",

    "content": "Yan Feng, after a look from Xue Po, immediately reacted and hastily said, \"Thank you, Big Brother.\"\n\nThe servant served fragrant tea and withdrew. Xue Po waved his hand, and the servants who had been preparing to attend in the living room also left. He glanced at the First Prince and smiled, \"Your Highness has graced my humble abode so early in the morning; you must have something important to discuss.\"\n\nYan Ji cursed inwardly, *You old fox, weren't you the one who sent someone to find me yesterday? And now you're playing dumb.* With a slight smile, he calmly replied, \"Your guest minister gave me a lot of guidance yesterday. Today, I've come specifically to seek your counsel, Marshal.\"\n\nXue Po nodded and said, \"First Prince, I, Xue Po, have spent my life on the battlefield and am a rough man. I'll speak plainly. Judging from the current situation, it is very unfavorable for you!\"\n\nYan Ji sighed, \"It was all my carelessness. I originally thought I had gained the upper hand, but I never expected Father Emperor to have this move of undermining the foundation. It seems the old ginger is still the spiciest.\" His words were quite disrespectful, but his expression was very calm.\n\nXue Po knew Yan Ji was testing him. He smiled indifferently and said, \"Your Highness, I understand what you are thinking now and am also clear about the current situation. As long as the matter is not settled, everything is still possible. But the final outcome will depend on whether you have enough courage. Your Highness should know the principle that the winner becomes king and the loser becomes a thief. To achieve great things, one must take risks. The greater the risk, the greater the reward. If Your Highness only seeks peace, then consider Xue Po as having said nothing.\"\n\nYan Ji said solemnly, \"Marshal Xue, you jest. You are an important minister of the Empire and have assisted Father Emperor for many years. I shall call you Uncle. Uncle Xue, since I have come here today, I have already made up my mind: I would rather be shattered than intact. Even if I wanted to yield, Fifth Brother would certainly not let me off after he ascends the throne. His despicable methods against Second Brother make this all too clear. I have come today to ask Uncle to guide me to a way out.\"\n\n\"Good, you truly are the one I, Xue Po, have taken a liking to.\" Xue Po stood up and paced back and forth in the living room. Although Yan Ji was anxious, he didn't dare to rush him at this moment.\n\nAfter a while, Xue Po's footsteps finally stopped. He stood in front of Yan Ji and looked him in the eye, \"Since that is the case, I wonder if Your Highness has such resolve.\" As he spoke, he struck his palm like a blade and lightly waved it in the air. a faint silver battle qi floated out, instantly splitting a sturdy wooden table in half.\n\nYan Ji's eyes lit up, and he also stood up, \"Uncle Xue, you need not worry. Since I have come here to seek an audience with you today, I am prepared to sacrifice everything. From what the guest minister said yesterday, I have already understood his intentions. To achieve anything now, one cannot have a shred of womanly kindness. Since he is not benevolent, do not blame me for being unrighteous.\" After saying this, he glanced at Yan Feng, who seemed not to have heard anything and was still lowering his head, drinking tea.\n\nXue Po smiled, \"Good. Since the First Prince has such resolve, then the matters I, Xue Po, have planned for the Prince can proceed. Your Highness, let us first analyze the current situation.\"\n\nYan Ji nodded. He had no doubts about Xue Po because of the conditions that Nian Bing had proposed on Xue Po's behalf yesterday. If there were no sincerity, Xue Po would not have easily proposed such conditions, and those conditions were exactly within the scope of his ability to agree to. Yan Ji was well aware of Xue Po's influence in the Ice Moon Empire. He not only wanted to use Xue Po but also recognized Xue Po as a military genius whom he would need to heavily rely on even after inheriting the throne. Therefore, although Nian Bing's words had greatly surprised him, Xue Po's sudden decision to support his actions also greatly alleviated his worries. With the support of two of the three Marshals, he had some confidence even in staging a coup, let alone the fact that it had not reached that point yet.\n\n\"Alright, I will first speak of my current situation. In front of Uncle Xue, I have nothing to hide. Currently, the city defense of the outer city of Ice Moon City is in my hands. Fifty thousand troops can be mobilized at any time. Moreover, the forces that stand on my side occupy nearly two-thirds, including many influential figures. Even if my actions are somewhat unconventional, as long as I can ultimately sit on that position, I am confident I can suppress all dissenting voices. At present, there are two major problems. One is from the Royal Guard. You are also very familiar with the commander of the Royal Guard. He is loyal only to my father, and no matter what method is used, it is impossible to win him over to my side. Therefore, we no longer need to expend any further effort in this regard. The second, and most important, is the potential threat from the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. Without her, I would have some confidence in dealing with just the Royal Guard. Yan Ji has been planning for that day for over ten years. I believe the cards in my hand are already sufficient.\"\n\nXue Po smiled coldly and said, \"Good, Your Highness truly considers me as one of your own. Since that is the case, I have no need to hide anything from Your Highness. Xue Po had already made up his mind long ago, but I was hesitating on how to choose in the end. Alas, to be frank, if it weren't for what happened to my daughter, I wouldn't have decided so quickly. After all, it's still uncertain who will win. However, for the day you mentioned, Xue Po has also made some preparations. Although the number of guest ministers in my manor is not large, they are all capable individuals.\"\n\nYan Ji nodded in deep agreement. Nian Bing's unfathomable nature had left a deep impression on him.\n\nXue Po paused for a moment, and after a long while, as if he had made up his mind, a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes, \"I believe I can solve both problems that Your Highness mentioned.\"\n\nYan Ji exclaimed in surprise, \"This... is it possible? Uncle Xue, I don't quite understand what you mean.\"\n\nXue Po smiled slightly and asked, \"How many people do you think are needed to contend with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess?\"\n\nYan Ji thought for a moment and replied, \"It is hard to say how powerful a Divine Descender is. To deal with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, a large number of experts are needed. And they must be at least Martial Saint level or above. Ordinary people facing the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess can only be cannon fodder. With a single spell, she can easily tear apart large numbers of soldiers. I have invited four guest ministers of Martial Saint level, but even combined, they are probably no match for the Ice Bowl Goddess Priestess, are they? The strength of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess can no longer be measured by the title of magician.\"\n\nXue Po's eyes gleamed brightly, and he said in a deep voice, \"What if we add three more Martial Saints and four Magisters?\"\n\nYan Ji's entire body trembled, and he looked at Xue Po in shock. He never imagined that Xue Po possessed such formidable strength.\n\nXue Po smiled calmly, \"Only through trials of iron and blood can true experts be cultivated. I believe Your Highness understands this principle. If I can be dominant on the battlefield, I must naturally possess my own powerful forces. Otherwise, how could I be worthy of being this Marshal?\"\n\nYan Ji took a deep breath and said, \"If Uncle Xue truly has so many experts assisting me, then you are absolutely the foremost Marshal of my Empire. With eleven Martial Saints and other experts attacking in conjunction, I think that no matter how strong the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess is, you will be unable to resist her. Uncle Xue, you have truly given me confidence!\"\n\nXue Po smiled, \"I have helped you solve the biggest problem. As for the imperial palace, I have five hundred personal guards. These are all carefully cultivated death warriors, skilled in combined combat techniques. With them assisting Your Highness's men, charging into the imperial palace should not be too much of a problem. As for those Ice God Towers and the high-level magicians in the imperial palace, Your Highness need not worry. Those people are indeed very threatening, but when the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess arrives at Ice Moon City, as subordinates of the Ice God Tower, they will surely go to greet her. That brief period of time is precisely our best opportunity to act. Moreover, an attack on the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess will inevitably alert the imperial palace. No one is better at relaying messages than the people of the Ice God Tower. Therefore, when dealing with her, we must also dispatch a large number of soldiers to surround her. It would be even better if this could cause the Royal Guard to be mobilized.\"\n\nYan Ji's eyes narrowed, and a cold glint flickered continuously. \"Good, I understand. When the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess leaves the Ice God Tower is the time for us to act. Uncle Xue, let us discuss the specific details. With your men cooperating, my chances of success will greatly increase.\"\n\nAn hour later, Yan Ji left the Marshal's Mansion. As he left, a confident smile appeared on his face. When it came to fighting wars, who in the Ice Moon Empire could be more skilled than an expert like Xue Po? Meticulous planning was the key to success. Moreover, the hidden forces that Yan Ji had cultivated were not that simple either. Although the Royal Guard was loyal, not every member was equally so. Furthermore, his own mother was in the imperial palace.\n\n\"He is indeed that woman's son, deciding so easily to strike at his own brothers and father,\" Yan Feng said calmly.\n\nXue Po smiled and said, \"Yan Ji is indeed a formidable individual. He has been making arrangements to ascend the throne for more than just a day or two. According to the information we have obtained, Marshal Nais, who supports him, has secretly dispatched his main forces. Nais's garrison is very close to Ice Moon City. Although Yan Ji did not state it explicitly, the troops to deal with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess will definitely be drawn from Nais. Although the Fifth Prince also has the support of Marshal Ram, Ram's garrison is far from the imperial city, and even if he mobilizes his troops, it will not be easy. Moreover, there are my forces blocking the interior of Marshal Ram's army. If he wants to return to Ice Moon City, he must pass through the territories of my troops. Therefore, whether it is the First Prince or the Fifth Prince, they have always wanted to win me over. For a long time, the Empire was not afraid of military power being held by us Marshals, precisely because during peacetime, we Marshals must reside in Ice Moon City, and there are many garrisons in every city of the Empire. However, this practice inevitably leads to the Marshals' power becoming too great. Once any Marshal intends to rebel, it will have a significant impact on the Empire.\"\n\nYan Feng was taken aback and said, \"Father, why are you telling me this...?\"\n\nXue Po smiled slightly and said, \"Just as money is only truly yours when it's in your hand, military power is only truly controlled by the monarch when it's completely in their hands. Therefore, after you ascend the throne, the first thing you must do is to divide the power of the Marshals.\"\n\nYan Feng's heart warmed. He knew that Xue Po was doing this entirely for his sake. He nodded firmly and said, \"If I can truly ascend to that position, I will certainly follow your instructions and replace important military positions with my own people.\"\n\nXue Po sighed inwardly. *Although you are my son-in-law, I must do this for the sake of the Blood Lion Cult. How many of your own people do you have? To be precise, it should be replacing them with our Blood Lion Cult's people. At that time, your influence in the military will be completely hollowed out!*\n\n\"What about Nian Bing? Hasn't he woken up yet?\" Yan Feng asked.\n\nXue Po frowned slightly and said, \"I don't know either. Perhaps he is still resting.\" He had also felt the strange energy fluctuations from the dwelling where Nian Bing was staying last night, but he had also received a soul transmission from Nian Bing informing him not to disturb him, which was why he hadn't interfered. Originally, Nian Bing was supposed to participate in today's meeting with Yan Ji, but he did not come.\n\nChanging into a brand-new white magic robe, Nian Bing walked out of his room. Breathing in the slightly cold, fresh air and feeling the continuously surging energy within his body, he couldn't help but reveal a triumphant smile. The activation of the six *Lichong* acupoints had shown him the hope for his future. Although what Oscar had said about the six *Qiao* acupoint levels made him understand that he could not yet contend with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, he had also come to understand the importance of the *Tianyian* acupoint even more. Without the six *Tianyian* acupoints, the *Lichong* acupoint could not have been activated so quickly. What the fatty said was indeed very true; the *Tianyian* acupoint was a spiritual acupoint. With it, it would be easier for him to cultivate to a higher realm.\n\nHe could clearly feel a warm stream of energy in his chest. Nian Bing found that his magic power was much more stable than before. Since the destruction of the Heavenly Flower Token, this was the first time he had felt this way. The absorption rate of Innate Qi had also significantly increased compared to before. After activating the *Lichong* acupoint, Nian Bing vaguely felt that the cultivation of the body's seven major acupoints was closely related to Innate Qi. Only by making full use of Innate Qi could it evolve faster. And by mastering the method of absorbing the essence of heaven and earth, his Innate Qi absorption rate had significantly improved. However, Nian Bing still hadn't figured out the connection between Innate Qi and his magic power. Was it really as simple as just an auxiliary role?\n\nAnother month passed. The ripples caused by the Second Prince's death gradually subsided, and the entire Ice Moon City also calmed down. However, those who understood the inside story knew that this was merely the calm before the storm.",

    "content": "At the secret chamber of the Ice Moon Hall of the Blood Lion Cult.\n\nThe Grand Elder sighed, \"It seems talent is the foundation of a master. Bai, we have all tried during this time, but no matter what methods we've used, we cannot feel the innate energy, let alone the seven acupoints you described. We are all old, and time no longer allows us to make major breakthroughs.\"\n\nAfter opening the Li Zhong acupoint, Nian Bing did not rush to explore its uses. Instead, he continuously cultivated diligently to increase his magic power. Nourished by the innate energy, his magic power advanced rapidly. The Tian Yan acupoint, which he reached in the middle stage, also brought him many surprises. Subtle controls that were previously impossible could now be easily accomplished, especially the delicate control of Shadow Puppets and the changes in the Tian Yan domain, all reaching a new height. The innate domain truly strengthens with increasing cultivation. He sincerely hoped that the seven elders could become stronger. All seven elders were seasoned Martial Saints or Archmages. If they could break through their bottlenecks and reach new realms, the strength of the Blood Lion Cult would undoubtedly ascend to a higher level, and even the age issue that constrained them would be somewhat alleviated. However, possessing innate energy was not as easy as imagined. Although Nian Bing had unreservedly shared his cultivation process with the seven elders, after a month, the seven elders remained at their original realms, not even a trace of innate energy produced.\n\n\"Grand Elder, you don't need to be disheartened. I believe that as long as you persevere, all the elders will surely break through.\" Nian Bing said, while pondering the loopholes in his cultivation, but he discovered that being able to open the Tian Yan and Li Zhong acupoints was largely due to the special environment and good luck, and these were things that could not be taught.\n\nA knock on the door suddenly sounded, startling Nian Bing from his thoughts. \"Enter.\"\n\nThe door opened, and Yin Dang, the Hall Master of the Ice Moon Hall, walked in from outside respectfully, saying, \"Cult Master, the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice has left the Ice God Tower and is heading towards Ice Moon City. Only envoys sent by the Ice Moon Empire are accompanying her.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes lit up, \"Good, what was expected has indeed come. Hall Master Yin, transmit my orders. Five hundred Blood Guards of the Blood Lion Hall, prepare for immediate deployment. Seven Elders, it is time for you to set out as well.\" As he spoke, he took out seven magic scrolls from his embrace and handed them to the seven elders respectively. \"These seven scrolls are your final life-saving items. If the situation allows, you do not need to force yourselves. Activate the scrolls immediately. The scrolls' destination is Ice Moon City, and after you return, you will wait for me here. Esteemed Elders, prioritize your safety. You are more important than this mission.\"\n\nThe seven elders each received the magic scrolls handed over by Nian Bing. The Grand Elder smiled slightly, \"Cult Master, rest assured, it is not easy to dismantle these old bones of ours. Moreover, there are so many cannon fodders. Utilizing the situation is what our Blood Lion Cult is best at.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"Your task is to stall. Absolutely do not engage in direct combat. Once the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice performs a divine descent technique, you must immediately tear open the scrolls and escape. It's laughable that the First Prince Yan Ji actually believes that eleven Martial Saints can kill a Divine Descent Master. But he has no idea of the true power of the divine descent technique.\" From Magician and Martial Saint to Divine Descent Master and Divine Master, although there is only one realm difference, the power is vastly different. Back then, the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice, having only recently become a Divine Descent Master, was able to single-handedly contend with three Archmages, including the Flame Lion King Rong Yan, and returned victorious. Twenty years later, she will undoubtedly be even more powerful. Based on the accumulation of strength, she would naturally be a match for eleven Martial Saints and Master Seekers. However, once she unleashes the divine descent technique without regard for her magic power and personal injury, even more experts will be unable to resist. Nian Bing once heard several Dragon Kings mention that even with their formidable bodies, Dragon Kings would be injured by the immense pressure of an 11th-tier forbidden spell when casting it. Therefore, unless absolutely necessary, no one would easily cast spells above the 11th tier, as the burden was too great. Hence, his mission for the seven elders was only to stall, not to inflict damage.\n\nConcurrently with Nian Bing's actions, the First Prince's mansion also reacted. A full five thousand elite troops had already been arranged by the First Prince in various secret courtyards within Ice Moon City. The operation could commence with just his command.\n\nNian Bing returned to the inn alone. A great upheaval was about to occur in Ice Moon City, and he had to ensure Mao Mao's safety.\n\n\"Brother Nian Bing, you're back, that's great! Sister Bing Yun also went out today, and Mao Mao is so lonely by herself.\" Mao Mao giggled and ran to Nian Bing, holding his hand and shaking it vigorously.\n\nNian Bing naturally knew where Bing Yun had gone. Since the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice was coming to Ice Moon City, the Ice God Tower's affiliated personnel naturally had to go out to welcome her. It was good that she wasn't here, otherwise, he would have to find a way to get rid of her. He smiled slightly, \"Mao Mao, come with Brother Nian Bing. Brother will find a new place for you to live.\"\n\nMao Mao was startled, \"What about Sister Bing Yun? She'll be worried if she can't find us when she returns.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, \"It's okay, Brother will contact her. Let's go quickly, we need to leave here immediately.\" He still had many things to do and couldn't delay for a moment.\n\nMao Mao's expression turned slightly pale, \"Brother, is it because Sister Bing Yun wants to catch you?\"\n\nThis time, it was Nian Bing's turn to be stunned, \"Mao Mao, you already know?\"\n\nMao Mao nodded, \"I heard Sister Bing Yun talking to someone with a crystal ball, saying she wants to catch you back to some tower. Brother, I think Sister Bing Yun is a good person, but why does she want to catch you?\"\n\nNian Bing sighed softly, \"These things cannot be explained clearly in a few words. Brother will tell you later. Alright, let's go. Great changes are about to happen in Ice Moon City. Brother will take you to a safe place first. When everything calms down, I will send you home, okay?\"\n\nMao Mao nodded obediently and quickly ran back to her room to pack her simple luggage. Nian Bing did not notice a hint of cunning flicker in Mao Mao's beautiful, moving eyes.\n\nNian Bing sent Mao Mao to the secret chamber of the Ice Moon Hall and, after instructing the Blood Lion Cult subordinates to take good care of her, he immediately left the Ice Moon Hall and headed straight for the Marshal's Mansion. At this time, the five hundred Blood Guards of the Blood Lion Hall of the Blood Lion Cult had already assembled.\n\nIn the secret chamber, Mao Mao opened the door and secretly peeked outside. At this time, the members of the Blood Lion Cult were all busy with the upcoming dramatic changes, and no one noticed her. She closed the door again, giggled, and softly chanted, \"By my name Xiyun, I summon you, come forth, my pet Qiangqiang.\"\n\nA gentle light flickered in Mao Mao's eyes, and a clear white hexagram appeared before her. With a flash of light, a dark object appeared on the ground before her. If anyone could see it at this moment, they would be astonished. For what appeared before Mao Mao was a giant cockroach, a cockroach the size of a plate. Its body, nearly a foot in diameter, shimmered with a faint light, its two antennae swaying slightly. Its body lay motionless on the ground.\n\nMao Mao kicked the giant cockroach, chiding, \"Stop sleeping! You little pets are all lazy.\"\n\nThe giant cockroach then moved, nuzzling affectionately against Mao Mao's foot. Mao Mao's eyes flashed. The giant cockroach's body spun rapidly on the ground, and a black light, devoid of any dark aura, enveloped Mao Mao's body. Mao Mao stepped forward, standing on the cockroach's back. Although this summoned beast, her cockroach, did not possess much attack power, it was the best concealment beast. Even in its first stage, this cockroach had once tricked the Phoenix Woman with its illusionary abilities. Now, in its second stage, it had more protective functions. Enveloped by the black light, Mao Mao chanted again, \"By my name Xiyun, I summon you, come forth, my pet Tiantian.\"\n\nWith a flash of light, Tiantian, a large rat whose size had increased significantly, wagged its tail, wiggled its plump backside, and looked at Mao Mao with its small, dark red eyes. Through the unique spiritual power of the white race, Mao Mao immediately issued commands to Tiantian.\n\n\"Rats are born to dig holes, and Dark Imps are masters of digging and tracking. Tiantian, you lead the way and follow Brother Nian Bing. Qiangqiang, you follow Tiantian, don't get lost.\"\n\nThe Tiantian rat nodded its head. Its two front paws moved rapidly on the ground like steel claws. Its huge body quickly burrowed down, and the black light on Qiangqiang's back clearly intensified. Mao Mao crouched down, and under the effect of the black light, she merged with the cockroach. The cockroach moved quickly and, with a whoosh, chased after Tiantian, who had burrowed into the ground. The secret chamber of the Ice Moon Hall, which was supposed to be strictly guarded, now had a hole in it. In fact, Mao Mao herself did not expect that she would think of the same thing as Nian Bing.\n\nAt the Ice Moon Empire's Imperial Palace, the already very weak Emperor Yan Tiannan received the news of the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's imminent arrival, and his spirit visibly improved. With the help of the palace maids, he sat up halfway and ordered Rudolph, the head of the Royal Guard, whom he trusted the most, \"Rudolph, the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice is about to arrive in Ice Snow City. My body is unwell, so you will represent me. Immediately lead three thousand elites of the Royal Guard to the city gate to welcome her. I believe the experts from the Ice God Tower have already gone.\"\n\nRudolph was upright and deeply trusted by Yan Tiannan. He was somewhat surprised and said, \"Your Majesty, the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice is already the most powerful existence on the continent, and with the people from the Ice God Tower welcoming her, I don't think I need to go. Protecting your safety is my most important duty. I don't think the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice would care about these worldly courtesies.\"\n\nAfter Yan Tiannan dismissed the surrounding palace maids, he took a deep breath, mustered his weary spirit, and said, \"Of course, I know the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice does not need formal greetings. The most important reason I want you to go and welcome her is not about the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice. With the impending arrival of the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice, there is no reason for the forces the eldest prince has gathered in the city to know, and with his intelligence, even if he didn't anticipate my decision beforehand, upon hearing of the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's appearance, he would undoubtedly react. At this time, Yun'er is the most in danger. I am sending you to welcome the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice, but the true intention is for you to also bring Yan Yun into the palace. With the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice present, I can then announce the successor. Within this imperial palace, although I am the absolute master, you are the only one I can trust. Although the Imperial Guard only has ten thousand people, there are many experts among them. You must take three thousand men to escort Yan Yun back to ensure his safety. Don't worry, I will definitely hold on until you return. Cough... cough...\" Having said so much in one breath, he was already having trouble breathing, coughing a few times, and his face became even paler.\n\nRudolph was startled. He was unable to hide his words, \"Your Majesty, do you mean the First Prince might make a move on the Fifth Prince?\"\n\nYan Tiannan gave a bitter smile, \"Although you had not yet come to the palace when I ascended the throne, you must have heard how I inherited the throne. In order to control the power of a nation, there was nothing one would not do, even against one's own brothers. Alright, hurry and go, lest something changes. I think the eldest prince is about to make a move.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty, the Seventh Prince requests an audience. He has also specifically brought a doctor to diagnose you.\" The voice of the head eunuch came from outside the door.\n\nA faint smile appeared on Yan Tiannan's face. Amidst the anxiety, only this seventh son could somewhat relieve his worries. Since Yan Feng and Xue Po's daughter, Xue Yu, became engaged, Yan Feng had been visiting Yan Tiannan in the imperial palace almost every day. Although he spoke very little, Yan Tiannan could see his son's genuine concern. What reassured Yan Tiannan the most was that this son, whom he had once valued the least, had never made any requests of him, not a single one. Every time he visited, he would quietly accompany him for a while, then quietly depart. Occasionally, when they conversed, his voice remained as cold as usual. Yan Tiannan suddenly realized that after a lifetime as ruler, the one who stayed by his side in the end was this son.\n\nYan Tiannan winked at Rudolph and said, \"Let him in.\"\n\nRudolph respectfully bowed to Yan Tiannan before retreating. He had already acted according to Yan Tiannan's orders.\n\nThe door opened again, and Yan Feng walked in with a young man dressed in grey cloth. Yan Tiannan smiled faintly, \"Feng'er, why are you here again? Why don't you spend more time with your future wife? It's a pity Father Emperor's health is failing, otherwise, I would definitely preside over your wedding.\"",

    "title": "Chapter 152: The Coming of the Snow Goddess Sacrifice (Part 1)",
    "content": "Yan Feng lowered his head and walked to Yan Tiannan's side, sitting down. He said calmly, as he always did, \"Father Emperor, your health is important. Today I've brought a Light Elementalist. Perhaps his healing can have some effect on your body.\" As he spoke, his gaze shifted to the grey-clothed youth who had come into the room with him.\n\nThe one in grey was precisely Nian Bing. Upon hearing Yan Feng introduce him, he quickly and respectfully bowed to Yan Tiannan. It was his first time seeing the king of the Ice Moon Empire. At this moment, the king looked more like an old man nearing the end of his life, completely lacking the majesty a monarch should possess.\n\n\"Nian Bing pays his respects to Your Majesty.\"\n\nYan Tiannan weakly waved his hand and said, \"Get up. No need to trouble yourself further. I know my own body best. Feng'er, stay with me longer today. Father Emperor's time is running out. I hope to have my son by my side in my final moments.\"\n\nA complex light flickered in Yan Feng's eyes. After a long pause, he silently nodded. At this moment, the expression left on his mother's face after she became a corpse surfaced in his mind. He would never, ever forget that expression.\n\nYan Tiannan's eyes grew hazy, and he sighed, \"Actually, I know I've wronged your mother. Your arrival in this world was entirely an accident. I am not a good father, nor a good emperor. My life has passed by in a flash, and it is drawing to a close, an end...\"\n\nNian Bing approached the bedside and helped Yan Tiannan sit up. After Yan Feng and Nian Bing entered the room, eight experts from the imperial palace followed them in. They were all at the level of Martial Artists. Aside from those Yan Tiannan trusted the most, anyone meeting him would have imperial guards present. Seeing Nian Bing reach out to Yan Tiannan's body, the eight guards simultaneously stepped forward.\n\nNian Bing didn't even glance at these guards, saying softly, \"Your Majesty, please allow this humble subject to try. Perhaps it can help you.\"\n\nYan Tiannan nodded. \"It's rare for Feng'er to show such filial piety. Go ahead and try. I haven't held out much hope for myself anyway.\"\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath, supporting Yan Tiannan's body with one hand and placing the other on his back. Through the sensitive Heavenly Eye acupoint, he quickly assessed Yan Tiannan's physical condition. Although he had his own motives for coming here, he couldn't help but let out a soft gasp.\n\nYan Tiannan smiled calmly. \"You've seen it then? My life is currently being sustained entirely by various precious medicines. In my youth, to contend for this imperial throne, I sacrificed too much. I suffered severe injuries, and my internal organs have long been damaged. Although I've undergone years of recuperation, there has been no improvement. Moreover, as an emperor, the temptations before me were too numerous. Alcohol, women, coupled with severe injuries, my body has long since rotted away. It's beyond saving. I myself cultivate martial arts and am very clear about my own body. While Light Magic has strong healing effects, it can only heal wounds, not illnesses. Even the most powerful mage cannot reshape my body. I heard from the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess that for my body to truly recover, it would require the assistance of a 12th-tier Light Magic Divine Descent spell to reshape all my bones and internal organs. However, there are no such experts on the entire Yang Guang Continent, so you don't need to waste your effort.\"\n\nNian Bing clearly felt Yan Tiannan's body rapidly deteriorating. He was indeed barely clinging to life; it was his determined will that kept him from dying. Once that last breath was gone, his life would end completely. Taking a deep breath, Nian Bing slowly closed his eyes. Mobilizing his soul, thick primordial qi flowed slowly through his right palm into Yan Tiannan's body. He released the primordial qi very slowly, fearing Yan Tiannan's body was too weak to accept it.\n\nYan Tiannan's entire body trembled. Nourished by the primordial qi, a faint red hue appeared on his face. His previously weakening complexion actually appeared much more spirited at this moment. His eyes showed surprise. \"Ah! This seems to be primordial qi. The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess also used primordial qi to treat me before. Feng'er, I didn't expect you to have such a friend.\" He naturally knew what primordial qi represented. Although he felt Nian Bing's primordial qi was not as strong as the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's, its purity surpassed hers. Such a person was definitely worthy of respect, which was why he didn't refer to Nian Bing as Yan Feng's subordinate but as a friend.\n\nNian Bing said, \"Your Majesty, please speak less. I will try to use primordial qi to help treat your internal injuries.\"\n\nYan Tiannan shook his head. \"It's useless. Your primordial qi can only sustain my life, but it cannot heal my damaged internal organs. However, with the support of your primordial qi, I should be able to await the arrival of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess.\"\n\nIndeed, primordial qi was utterly incapable of healing Yan Tiannan's severe injuries. Since Yan Tiannan's body was beyond saving, Nian Bing felt a sense of relief. He could see that as Yan Feng and Yan Tiannan had interacted more in recent days, Yan Feng's hatred for his father had lessened considerably. He had mentioned several times that his father was an old man on the verge of death. Although he hated him, without Yan Tiannan, he would not exist. Therefore, he wanted to fulfill his filial duty during this final period. Now that Yan Tiannan was truly beyond saving, the potential internal conflict Nian Bing might have experienced would not arise. He didn't merely see Yan Feng as a tool to be used; Yan Feng was his friend. From what Yan Feng had done for Xue Sheng, Nian Bing had accepted him as a friend, perhaps even a brother. Nian Bing could not bring himself to kill his friend's father to achieve his own goals. Before coming here, he had already decided that if Yan Tiannan could be saved, he would heal him, even if it meant abandoning this \"change of regime\" operation. At that time, although Yan Feng's succession would be hopeless, at least the matter of Long Ling's marriage would be easier to resolve.\n\nEven Yan Feng was unaware of Nian Bing's complex thoughts. Seeing Yan Tiannan's complexion improve, his own expression softened slightly. \"Father Emperor, please rest for a while. I'll stay here with you.\"\n\nYan Tiannan shook his head. \"No, I have something to tell you. If I don't say it now, I might not have another chance. Feng'er, do you want to hear the story of your mother and me, and my thoughts on you?\" Without waiting for Yan Feng's reply, he continued, \"Back then, after getting drunk, I took your mother. I never expected to have you. As the saying goes, even a tiger doesn't eat its cubs. Even though your mother didn't have a good background, you are, after all, my son. However, at that time, even if I wanted to treat you and your mother better, I couldn't. There are some things you can't possibly know. Actually, I've only been emperor for ten years. During the initial period after inheriting the throne, I couldn't be called a ruler of a nation at all.\"\n\nYan Feng said calmly, \"Father Emperor, you don't need to say more. I understand what you want to say very well. The only reason you are in your current position is because of the Empress's help. Without her family's vast influence, you wouldn't be where you are today. Therefore, you listened to the Empress, even feared her to some extent. This only changed after you cultivated enough power to secure your position. However, at that time, you had truly forgotten my existence. If I'm guessing correctly, you must have known about everything the Empress and my fifth brother's mother did to my mother and me. The Empress and my fifth brother's mother conspired to kill my mother, and at the same time, they found such a master for me. They didn't kill me but wanted to see me become the biggest joke in the Ice Moon Empire's royal family. Am I correct?\"\n\nYan Tiannan looked at Yan Feng with some surprise and said with a wry smile, \"So you knew everything. It seems I underestimated you.\"\n\nYan Feng let out a soft sigh. \"If I can't even figure out how my own mother died, I'm not worthy of being called a son. Father Emperor, please rest. I don't want to talk about these things because I don't want to hate you. No matter how you treated me, your blood flows through me. I am willing to accompany you in your final moments, without speaking of hatred or love, simply because I am your son.\"\n\nYan Tiannan's eyes became a little moist. Looking at Yan Feng's handsome face, he sighed again. \"A dying man speaks good words, child. I have wronged you and your mother. Unfortunately, I have nothing left to compensate you with. After your fifth brother arrives, I will instruct him to treat you well in the future. With Marshal Xue Yuan's support, I believe your life will be much better than before. That's all I can do.\"\n\nNian Bing maintained his primordial qi, looking at Yan Tiannan. He couldn't help but think of his own father. He forcibly suppressed his emotions, preventing them from bursting forth. It seemed today would truly decide everything. Yan Tiannan! If you truly wish to compensate, then make the final decision according to my plan. His plan contained an element of gambling. Only if Yan Tiannan followed his plan to the letter could this \"change of regime\" operation be perfect; otherwise, everything was uncertain.\n\nJust as Yan Feng was attending to his father in the imperial palace, outside Ice Moon City, the experts of the Ice God Tower were preparing to welcome the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, whom they regarded as supreme.\n\nBing Yun stood before more than thirty Ice Elementalist mages. Although her strength was not the strongest among these mages, she was the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's most beloved disciple and also the most talented disciple in the Ice God Tower. Just yesterday, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had contacted her through a crystal ball. During their brief conversation, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess didn't say much, only informing Bing Yun that she would soon be arriving in Ice Moon City and instructing her to gather everyone from the Ice God Tower in Ice Moon City to await her.\n\nUpon receiving the news from the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, Bing Yun was genuinely happy. She vaguely sensed that her master had made new breakthroughs in magic. As for the extent of this breakthrough, it was impossible to guess. At the same time, she felt a sense of melancholy. She knew very well that once her master left, Nian Bing would also return to the Ice God Tower with her. Even if Nian Bing's strength was greater, he couldn't possibly contend with her master! But, was this a good thing or a bad thing? Bing Yun couldn't be sure what kind of treatment Nian Bing would receive.\n\nRudolf, acting on Yan Tiannan's orders, selected the most elite guards from the Royal Guard, leaving the palace with the utmost speed. He led twenty men directly towards the north gate, while the three thousand guards he brought with him went directly to the fifth prince's manor. Welcoming the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess didn't require many people. Once they rendezvoused with her, they would pass by the fifth prince's manor on the way back to the imperial palace. At that point, with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess present, there would be no further changes.\n\nWhen he arrived, he didn't find many changes at the fifth prince's manor. Everything was as usual. The first prince seemed to know nothing, and the atmosphere in Ice Moon City hadn't changed at all. Seeing this, Rudolf secretly breathed a sigh of relief. After all, it was better to resolve everything peacefully. Soon, he arrived outside the north city gate and joined Qian Huan Bing Yun and other Ice God Tower experts, waiting for the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's arrival.\n\nIndeed, the first prince had not sent anyone to harm the fifth prince. This was because he knew it was unnecessary. To deal with the fifth prince, he didn't need to take any action himself. He had issued the attack order, and the one in charge of the attack was Xue Po. To demonstrate his trust in Xue Po, Yan Ji handed over all five thousand elite troops formed from his forces to Xue Po's control. He himself quietly left the first prince's manor and went to the Marshal's manor of Xue Po. Everything was proceeding according to plan, following the plan of the first prince Yan Ji, and also the plan of the Blood Lion Sect.\n\nRudolf and Bing Yun were waiting for the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's arrival, but they didn't know that it wasn't so easy for the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess to reach Ice Moon City.\n\nOn this Yang Guang Continent, if one were to name the most arrogant person, there would be no hesitation; the answer would undoubtedly be the owner of the Ice God Tower, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. Her arrogance stemmed from her strength. One had to wonder, how could the continent's sole Divine Descent Master not have the capital for arrogance?\n\nAs soon as she came out of seclusion, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess received an envoy from Ice Moon City. After reading the letter written by Yan Tiannan, the King of the Ice Moon Empire, she didn't say much and immediately left the Ice God Tower with the envoy, heading towards Ice Moon City. Yan Tiannan's letter was very clear: the Ice Moon Empire was undergoing a change of imperial succession, and he requested the respected Ice Snow Goddess Priestess to come and witness this moment.",

    "content": "The Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess had met with Yan Tiannan many times and knew him well. She understood that Yan Tiannan was asking for her help. In truth, even without the support of the Ice Moon Empire, the Ice God Tower's position on the continent was unshakeable. No one dared to provoke her easily, not even a powerful empire. However, with the Ice Moon Empire's backing, the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess could cultivate better and more quickly advance towards the world she envisioned, so she would still assist the Ice Moon Empire on major matters. This current event was undoubtedly the most important in many years to come.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess was no ordinary ice mage. She didn't walk; ordinary ice mages couldn't maintain a blizzard for long, but she used it as a tool for flight. Large snowflakes, carried by a gentle breeze, lifted her and the envoy, carrying them towards Ice Moon City, the capital of the Ice Moon Empire, at the fastest possible speed. At her current pace, she would reach Ice Moon City in at most a day and a half.\n\nThe envoy sent by Yan Tiannan to invite the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess was undoubtedly an outstanding individual from his side. At this moment, the envoy was secretly observing the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess. It was his first time seeing this legendary figure. Upon seeing the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's peerless beauty, he realized that a woman could indeed be so stunning. However, the chilling aura emanating from the Ice and Snow Goddess also filled his heart with fear. No matter how he thought about it, he couldn't understand why a woman of over fifty years could be as captivating as a young beauty of sixteen. Unfortunately, this captivating beauty was also incredibly chilling.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, as usual, wore a white magic robe with intricately embroidered ice flowers that shimmered with a faint blue light. Her blue hair fluttered behind her, and her ice-cold eyes showed no trace of emotion. Around her body, due to the excessive condensation of ice elements, one could even hear the joyful calls of these magic elements. The blizzard outside her body had become an instinctive cycle; every snowflake appeared crystal clear.\n\nSupported by the blizzard, the surrounding air was frigid. Although the envoy's battle qi had some cultivation, his body had become somewhat stiff from the prolonged freezing. In the cold, he felt a growing urge to fall asleep. Just then, he suddenly saw a faint red light emanating from a mountain peak not far ahead.\n\nThe envoy saw it, and the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess naturally saw it too. She let out a cold snort, and the surrounding temperature seemed to instantly double in coldness. The air outside the blizzard condensed, and strangely, within this seemingly sealed space, the blizzard's buoyancy did not decrease at all. Surging ice elements poured out, and the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's eyes flashed with a cold light.\n\nA fire dragon, yes, it was a majestic fire dragon. Red light blazed, mixing with scorching flames that twisted the air like water. The colossal fire dragon lunged forward, its claws and teeth bared, heading straight for the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess in the air.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's body, floating on the blizzard, did not waver. A faint white light diffused from her like frost mist. She slowly opened her mouth, not to chant a spell, but to exhale a puff of faint white mist. With a soft sound, the mist merged with the cold current released around her body. In an instant, it condensed into a sixth-tier dual-colored ice-sealing sphere, flying towards the giant fire dragon.\n\nJust then, the fire dragon suddenly changed. When it was still thirty feet away from the dual-colored ice-sealing sphere, its body abruptly shifted from fiery red to bright blue. The blue flames exuded a somewhat eerie aura, and simultaneously, the surrounding temperature instantly increased.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess let out a soft exclamation. She wasn't surprised by the fire dragon transforming into true fire; rather, she was surprised because a black dragon had split from the giant blue fire dragon. The darkness and malevolence combined with the heat of the flames formed a dark blue hellfire. Under the ferocious forms of the two dragons, they suddenly charged upwards, now only ten feet away from the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess. The combination of these two spells had reached tenth-tier. The dual-colored ice-sealing sphere practically vanished instantly under the effect of the two magic dragons. The speed of the two dragons not only didn't decrease but increased, carrying two distinctly different magic elements to devour the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's eyes flashed with cold light. Within those cold eyes, a few wisps of excitement appeared. It had been a long time since she had encountered a mage who dared to attack her. Of course, she would not be afraid of the opponent's attack; in fact, she wouldn't even retreat, because she was the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, the only Divine Descendant on the continent, and also because of her pride.\n\nRaising her right hand, which was as clear and white as jade, the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's body, floating in the air, seemed to suddenly encounter immense gravity. Without any warning, she dropped abruptly, causing the envoy, who was also being supported by the blizzard, to exclaim in surprise. This momentary descent perfectly evaded the pounce of the two dragons.\n\nA cold yet pleasant voice chanted the spell word by word. The Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's right hand lit up, and a blue six-pointed star appeared in her palm. A point of golden light emerged from the center of the blue six-pointed star. The Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess sneered, her descending body suddenly halted in mid-air. She flipped her right hand, assuming a posture of supporting the sky with one palm. The blue six-pointed star rotated around the point of golden light, transforming into a pillar of light, about a foot in diameter, directly confronting the two dragons in the air.\n\nAt this moment, the envoy beside the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess felt it most profoundly. He was astonished to discover that around the faint ice aura surrounding the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's body, a circle of golden ripples had appeared. The Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's not-so-tall figure instantly exuded an incomparably vast dominance, no, to be precise, it should be kingly aura.\n\nThe ascending golden and blue lights were truly minuscule compared to the two magic dragons. However, it was this golden pillar of light that altered the downward momentum of the two dragons. They began to circle around the golden pillar of light. The Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess let out a soft cry, and the golden light instantly expanded. In that moment, the area within a ten-foot radius in the air was filled with a sense of void, yes, it was void; all magic elements were instantly drawn out by an inexplicable force. With a flash of light, the two dragons disappeared silently.\n\nOn the hill below, the second elder and fifth elder of the Blood Lion Seven Elders simultaneously let out a muffled groan and staggered back several steps. The powerful magic elements around their bodies instantly dimmed considerably. Under the influence of the qi connection, their magical power had already suffered a significant shock.\n\nThe Great Elder was inwardly startled. Although he didn't believe that his two brothers' combined magic could cause any harm to the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, he also didn't expect her to resolve it so quickly. Tenth-tier magic was so vulnerable before her. What worried the Great Elder most was that what the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess used did not seem to be as simple as ice magic.\n\nDespite his thoughts, the Great Elder waved his hand. Instantly, five thousand elite archers, ambushed around the hill, appeared. These archers were organized into groups of ten; six were responsible for setting up, three for drawing the bows, and one for loading the arrows. They were using one of the most lethal ranged attack equipment on the Yangguang Continent, called the Dragon Extinguisher Crossbow. This Dragon Extinguisher Great Crossbow was about half a zhang tall, one and a half zhang long, and two zhang wide. It required three people working together, using footrests and pulley assistance to draw it. It was the strongest war crossbow in the Yangguang Continent's military equipment. Due to its high cost and the need for a large number of soldiers to operate, it was not widely used. However, the power of this giant crossbow was immense, making it the strongest means against heavy cavalry and infantry. It was mostly used during sieges. One crossbow could simultaneously set three bolts, and once released, it was enough to kill any target within five hundred meters. As it was a heavy crossbow, its aiming was very precise, and its impact on important targets was quite formidable. The bolts were two feet long, with arrowheads made of refined steel. The bolt shafts were as thick as a child's arm, resembling short spears.\n\nThis time, to deal with the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, Crown Prince Yan Ji had truly gone all out. He had requisitioned the only heavy crossbow regiment in the entire Ice Moon Empire from the marshal who supported him. Against such a powerful existence as the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, only this type of heavy crossbow had the potential to inflict damage.\n\nWith the Great Elder's command, a total of five hundred heavy crossbows had their bowstrings drawn back with a creaking sound. Fifteen hundred heavy bolts were aimed at the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess in the air.\n\n\"Release!\" the Great Elder commanded. The bolts, like short spears, instantly transformed into a sky full of arrows, carrying a piercing whistle, and in the blink of an eye, covered all possible evasion space for the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess. Even if just one arrow hit her body, she, with her mage's physique, would not be able to withstand it.\n\nAt this moment, the envoy beside the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess had turned ashen. He naturally knew the power of the heavy crossbow; it could only be described as formidable.\n\nTwo beams of sharp light burst from the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's eyes. She extended her right hand to her chest, not controlling the blizzard to evade. The golden light once again emanated from her palm. The light flickered, completely locking down the surrounding space. The next moment, the sensation of space collapsing and being emptied appeared again. It wasn't just about drawing out magic elements; it also altered the gravity within the golden light's coverage. Standing there, floating, the fifteen hundred heavy crossbow bolts could only slide past her body without causing any damage. After the bolts passed, the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess immediately controlled the blizzard to transport her and the envoy to the ground. Clearly, while this golden light was powerful, it also consumed a great deal of mana, and she didn't want to become a target for the five thousand crossbowmen below while in the air.\n\nThe Great Elder's eyes shone brightly, and he said in a deep voice, \"The opportunity has come, follow me.\" He was naturally not calling the soldiers. Eleven figures simultaneously floated up, eight in front and three behind, forming a semicircle towards the direction where the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess was descending. The short distance could not delay them, these Martial Saint-level experts. Besides the Blood Lion Seven Elders, four more Martial Saints sent by Crown Prince Yan Ji also arrived. Yan Ji knew very well that to secure the imperial throne for a long time, he had to silently resolve this greatest threat.\n\nHowever, was the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess really that easy to deal with?\n\nLanding on the ground, she casually waved the golden light in her right palm towards the ground, creating a pit three zhang deep. The Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess waved her left sleeve, and a gust of icy wind sent the envoy into the pit. Her cold voice also resounded, \"Wait here if you want to live.\" After saying that, she advanced instead of retreating, her graceful figure dancing with the wind, heading towards the Blood Lion Seven Elders and the four Martial Saints.\n\nWhile this unprecedented battle was taking place, the operation within Ice Moon City had finally commenced. The five thousand elite troops secretly trained by Crown Prince Yan Ji simultaneously emerged from various corners of the city and launched an attack on the Imperial Palace with lightning speed and thunderous force. Their sole destination was to seize the Imperial Palace of the Ice Moon Empire. And where was Crown Prince Yan Ji at this moment?\n\nHe was underground, following behind a large rat.",

    "content": "Yan Ji was in a simple place. He was in the Imperial Palace, to be precise, he was currently underground in the Imperial Palace. With him were over five hundred people, including dozens of experts protecting him, as well as the five hundred Blood Guards provided by Marshal Xue Po.\n\nAt the forefront of the group was a black body as large as a small mountain. Although its body appeared exceptionally heavy, its rate of progress was astonishingly fast. Regardless of whether it was soil or rock, it was pushed aside by its massive claws as it continuously advanced. Upon this colossal figure's back sat a human-shaped figure cloaked in black. In his hand, he held a sword, an inconspicuous yet thoroughly sinister Blade of Darkness.\n\nYan Ji led his subordinates, following behind. At this moment, he felt much more at ease. He knew that as long as he could control everything within the Imperial Palace, the success of this operation would be simple. What he needed most now was a handwritten decree from his father, Yan Tian Nan. He believed he would succeed. The five thousand elite troops already attacking outside were merely cannon fodder, intended to attract the formidable forces of the Imperial Guard within the palace. He had not deployed the fifty thousand men of the Ice Moon Guard, for he knew that these fifty thousand were the key to stabilizing the situation and it was not yet time to use them.\n\nThe battle outside the Imperial Palace was undoubtedly fierce. The five thousand elite troops that Yan Ji had painstakingly cultivated had all taken special drugs before the operation. These drugs could fully stimulate the human body's potential and also fill the heart with a bloodthirsty desire. Although their strength could not compare to the Imperial Guard, their fearless charge posed a significant problem for the Imperial Guard. If it weren't for the support of many Imperial Mages behind the Imperial Guard, they might not have been able to withstand the charge of these five thousand elite troops. After all, the most elite three thousand men of the Imperial Guard had been led out of the Imperial Palace by their commander, Rudolf. Although Yan Tian Nan's planning was meticulous, he was, after all, gravely ill, and omissions were inevitable. Furthermore, he had never expected his own son to be audacious enough to directly send men to attack the Imperial Palace.\n\nInside the Imperial Palace, Nian Bing was still channeling innate energy to Yan Tian Nan. Although he was not involved in everything happening outside, he had complete control over all that was occurring. The ones helping Yan Ji carve a path underground were the Shadow Puppets and the fifth-tier evolved Shadow Rats, which he controlled with his spiritual power. This was a surprise force and the key to this operation. To defend against foreign invasion, the Imperial Guard would inevitably have to move out in large numbers, creating emptiness within the Imperial Palace. It was precisely at this time that Yan Ji could appear. The \"Cambrian Action\" had three critical points; the first was how to break into the Imperial Palace, and the second was located in the Fifth Prince's mansion.\n\nIn the Fifth Prince's mansion, upon receiving the news that the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice was imminent, Yan Yun was filled with excitement. He knew that the day he had always looked forward to was about to arrive. He had originally prepared to lead his subordinate experts directly to the Imperial Palace to wait, but that morning, three thousand people had arrived outside his mansion. Yan Yun was startled at first. But when he realized they were the Imperial Guard sent by Yan Tian Nan, the intelligent Yan Yun immediately understood his father's intentions. He did not rush and waited in his study, eagerly anticipating the arrival of the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice.\n\nNews of the sudden attack on the Imperial Palace quickly reached Yan Yun. Yan Yun was startled at first, but he quickly calmed down and sat there, saying, \"Elder Brother, Elder Brother, are you too naive? To dare to attack the Imperial Palace directly, your courage is too great. Even if most of the forces in Ice Moon City support you, no one will be willing to betray the empire for you. Do you think you can attack the Imperial Palace with just your solitary force? Naive, truly too naive.\" His confidence in the Imperial Palace was not without reason. Not only did the Imperial Palace have the Imperial Guard, but it was also divided into the Outer Palace and the Inner Palace. Between the Outer Palace and the Inner Palace, there were countless mechanisms, and even top experts would find it difficult to pass through these mechanisms safely to penetrate the Inner Palace. Let alone Yan Ji's five thousand men, even fifty thousand men would not pose a threat to the Imperial Palace in a short period. Although Yan Yun knew that the commander of the Ice Moon Guard had defected to the Elder Brother's side, he also knew that these fifty thousand men would not act rashly, otherwise, it would be outright rebellion. It was likely that no one dared to openly rebel now. This morning, after receiving the news that the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice was imminent, Yan Yun had already sent his subordinates to spread the word. At this point, it was no longer about enduring, but about stepping out. He believed that any intelligent person would understand what the arrival of the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice meant. Who would dare to oppose the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice, who could destroy a hundred thousand troops with her own power? Not to mention the existence of the Ice God Tower.\n\nTherefore, Yan Yun was very calm. He was merely waiting silently for the final moment to arrive.\n\nA gentle knock sounded at the door. Without asking, Yan Yun knew who it was. He smiled slightly and said, \"Cai Yan, come in. Didn't I tell you that you don't need to knock whenever you come to see me?\"\n\nThe door opened, and a tall woman stepped into the room. She carried a tray with a cup of tea. This woman was exceptionally well-proportioned. Her tall stature, paired with her long, light blue hair, made her look exceptionally captivating. Her equally blue eyes exuded a gentle glow. She was not particularly beautiful, but the elegance that emanated from her was intoxicating, like a pure lily quietly spreading its fragrance.\n\nCai Yan gracefully stepped forward and slowly approached Yan Yun. She placed the tray down and handed the tea to Yan Yun. She smiled softly and said, \"Propriety must be observed. How can I not knock? Although Your Highness favors me, Cai Yan cannot overstep.\"\n\nYan Yun smiled and said, \"Yan'er, do you know? What I love most is your politeness. Come.\" He placed the teacup aside, reached out, and pulled Cai Yan over, making her sit on his lap. Whenever he held this captivating and beautiful body, he felt a sense of fulfillment. Cai Yan had been with him for three years. Countless beauties had come and gone by his side, but only Cai Yan had always remained by his side, still in the mansion. Cai Yan's tolerance, gentleness, and shy demeanor always made him feel deep affection. Cai Yan had never asked for anything from him, only silently supported everything he did.\n\nCai Yan allowed Yan Yun's hands to roam over her body, a blush rising on her pretty face. She pushed the teacup towards Yan Yun and said softly, \"Your Highness, you have been distracted lately. I brewed you a cup of ginseng tea, made with century-old ginseng as the base. It's to replenish your vitality. Drink it while it's hot.\"\n\nYan Yun's heart warmed. He took the teacup and said, \"You know me best. Only when I'm with you do I feel comfortable. Yan'er, today is the most important day of my life. As long as everything is successful, I will definitely not treat you poorly. Although you come from a humble background, I will at least make you a noble consort and have you serve me every day.\"\n\nCai Yan obediently lowered her head and said, \"As long as Your Highness is well, Cai Yan is happy. Cai Yan has no other requests, only wishing to see Your Highness every day, which is enough. As for status or titles, Cai Yan has never thought about them.\"\n\nYan Yun opened the cup lid and took a sip of the tea. A rich aroma wafted to his nostrils. With the tea, a warm current spread throughout his body, instantly invigorating him. \"As expected of century-old ginseng, it tastes truly comforting. Yan'er, don't worry, I will always keep you by my side.\"\n\nCai Yan smiled slightly and said, \"Your Highness, is the ginseng tea delicious?\" There was a hint of strangeness in her smile.\n\nYan Yun paused slightly. Suddenly, a feeling of powerlessness spread throughout his body. He looked at Cai Yan in shock, \"You...\" During this time, to guard against the Elder Prince's potential insidious schemes, he had been extremely cautious, but he had never expected that the woman he trusted most would poison him.\n\nA gleam flashed in Cai Yan's eyes. Before Yan Yun could shout, she dislocated his jaw, leaving the shrewd Fifth Prince only able to utter guttural sounds.\n\n\"Your Highness, you were still careless. I've been by your side for three years, wouldn't I have taken action against you? Are you going to ask if I was sent by the Elder Prince? No, he wouldn't be able to mobilize me.\"\n\nA trace of sadness appeared in Yan Yun's eyes. With a look of intense affection, he gazed deeply at Cai Yan.\n\nCai Yan still maintained her charming smile. \"If you want to ask if I ever loved you, I can also answer: no, I never loved you, nor could I ever love anyone. In your eyes, I was just a frail little woman. In reality, with your strength, you might not even be my match in a head-on confrontation. I cultivate the Heartless Technique and am incapable of feeling love for anyone. I lurked by your side simply to master everything about you. Speaking of which, you are my first man, and also my only man so far. I'll tell you, I'm actually from the Blood Lion Sect. Perhaps this name is unfamiliar to you, but our Blood Lion Sect has existed for thousands of years. The era of the Ice Moon Empire is about to change. It's a pity that despite your years of careful planning, you still won't be able to ascend the throne.\" With a casual wave of her hand, she pressed onto Yan Yun's head. With a \"poof,\" Yan Yun's entire body trembled violently. His head completely caved in, and blood spurted from all seven orifices. As astute as he was, he ultimately met such an end.\n\nCai Yan acted as if she had done nothing. She picked up a nearby towel and wiped her hands, then slowly walked out of the room. Yan Yun had ordered that no one could disturb him easily without his permission, giving her ample time to leave.\n\nA violent roar, accompanied by surging magical elements, leveled a small hill. The Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's eyes were filled with fury. The eight Martial Saints and three Archmages surrounding her were causing her considerable trouble. Especially the spells of the three Archmages, which prevented her from focusing her energy on launching more destructive attacks against the Martial Saints. Even for a mage as powerful as her, without sufficient time to chant incantations, she couldn't unleash her strongest attacks.\n\nThe Grand Elder and the others were also astonished. Since the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice landed, they had already launched three waves of attacks. The combined holy aura from the eight Martial Saints was undoubtedly terrifying, but the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's right hand continuously emitted strange golden light, repelling them one by one without chanting any spells.\n\nBoth sides were panting, gathering their energy to prepare for their next attack. The Grand Elder stared intently at the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice, fearing that she might unleash the world-destroying Divine General Technique.\n\n\"Who exactly are you people? How dare you block me here.\" The Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's voice was filled with coldness.\n\nThe Grand Elder smiled calmly and said, \"The honored Sacrifice naturally wouldn't recognize us insignificant figures. You are the continent's strongest mage, but it's a pity that even the most powerful mage, without the time to chant spells, cannot unleash their strongest power.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice sneered, \"Do you really think so? Gathering so many experts, it seems you wish to take my life. Since that is the case, then let me show you the power of the gods.\"\n\nThe Blood Lion Seven Elders knew she was about to act. Having lived and cultivated together for many years, their hearts were in sync. Without any signal, they simultaneously launched their attacks. The surging battle aura and brilliant magic instantly wove into a large net that enveloped the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice stood there quietly, as if she saw nothing. Her right hand slowly extended forward. A ball of intense golden light erupted from below her chest, instantly spreading to every part of her body. The dense golden light had no magical aura, but the pure energy it exuded was exceptionally peculiar. At the same time, a ball of light also erupted from her lower abdomen, but this light was silver. Combined with the strange golden light from her right hand, the two golds and one silver intertwined in the air. The surrounding air suddenly became very cold, and the moisture in the air condensed into fine ice powder. The Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice said coldly, \"Who told you that mages cannot cast powerful spells without incantations? Forbidden: Metamorphosis of the Ice Snow Goddess Dragon.\" White light appeared without any warning. The white light instantly surged, and the first to suffer was the fire-elemental magic cast by the Fifth Elder. As the white light turned blue, it was completely nullified – and this was a ninth-tier offensive spell!\n\nThe three beams of light, two gold and one silver, condensed into a point of light in the air, a white point of light. The point of light instantly exploded. Amidst the blue light's embrace, dragon roars echoed everywhere. The Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's body floated into the air again, and a colossal blue dragon appeared before her. Opening its massive mouth, a breath of ice drifted out, enveloping the attacks of the Grand Elder and the others.",

    "content": "The Dragon of the Ice Goddess, when unleashed by the Ice Goddess Priestess and Nian Bing, produced completely different effects. The Ice Goddess Priestess's dragon was a true Level 11 Forbidden Spell. Wherever its breath passed, everything turned to ice; even battle energy seemed frozen, blocking all attacks. The giant blue dragon floated up, unleashing a torrent of ice attacks upon her enemies.\n\nThe faces of the seven elders and the four Martial Saints sent by the First Prince turned ashen. To cast a Level 11 Forbidden Spell without incantation—what kind of ability was this? They all realized they had underestimated the Ice Goddess Priestess.\n\nTwo gold and one silver, three hexagrams appeared on the Ice Goddess Priestess's chest, abdomen, and right hand. Particularly the gold-and-blue hexagram on her right hand looked exceedingly strange. All the magical elements were released after being mixed by these three points of light. In truth, they did not know that the Ice Goddess Priestess was also not faring well. Although her magical power was immensely strong, under the pressure of so many skilled martial artists, she had no time to chant incantations. The magic she was using at that moment was released after converting her own magical elements through her innate energy. While this method did not require incantations, it severely depleted her vital energy, consuming a large portion of her hard-cultivated innate energy.\n\nThe Ice Goddess Priestess had already opened the \"Li Zhong\" acupoint below her chest and the \"Xi Jing\" acupoint in her abdomen. Through years of cultivation, both these acupoints had reached the intermediate stage. The light emanating from her right hand was from the \"Qiao Liu\" acupoint, which she had fortunately opened during her recent secluded cultivation, and it was the \"Huang Ji\" acupoint, renowned for its offensive power. Unfortunately, her \"Huang Ji\" acupoint had only just opened, and though she knew how to use it, she could not fully unleash its might. Otherwise, if her \"Huang Ji\" acupoint had also reached the intermediate stage, even converting magic through innate energy alone would have allowed her to perform Divine Descent techniques. Facing powerful enemies, she had no choice but to use this method that consumed vital energy to attack.\n\nThe sudden appearance of the Level 11 Forbidden Spell forced the attacking Grand Elder and his group to switch from offense to defense. The eleven of them jointly cast over a dozen restrictions to defend against the massive ice dragon's attack. Although the power of a Forbidden Spell was immense, its consumption was equally so. The casting time depended on the caster's ability. The combined energy of the eight Martial Saints and three Magus Masters was far more immense than that of the Ice Goddess Priestess. A war of attrition would be absolutely advantageous to the Grand Elder's side; it was just that they were temporarily unable to attack due to the pressure. They were all waiting for an opportunity; as soon as the Ice Goddess Priestess's attacking energy weakened even slightly, they would immediately launch a full-power counterattack. However, their hearts remained heavy because they all heard a rhythmic sound.\n\nThough the Ice Goddess Priestess's voice was extremely cold, it was undoubtedly also very pleasant to hear. Floating behind the ice dragon, she softly chanted as if murmuring, \"God said, water is the source of all things in the world. Ice is the original form of water; pure yet filled with cold, ice shall extinguish all life. God said, foolishness is not a mistake, but the mistake lies in the foolish not knowing their foolishness; all who blaspheme against God shall be punished for foolishness and must undergo the purification of reincarnation to end the source of all sin. God said, ice is the sharpest weapon against all sins in heaven and earth; ice is the end for all who blaspheme. Only by transforming into ice can sins vanish.\"\n\nThe coldness in the Ice Goddess Priestess's voice disappeared. At this moment, she was like a gentle maiden, pouring out her heart. However, in her outpouring, the heavens changed.\n\nThe originally clear sky gradually darkened, and the brilliant sunlight vanished into the dark clouds.\n\nThe wind gradually grew stronger; it was a bone-chilling wind. The air became increasingly moist, but not from water; it was from the large masses of ice powder condensed from the moisture in the air.\n\nWrapped in a layer of blue halo, the area within ten zhang around the Ice Goddess Priestess's body completely transformed into a giant blue ball of light. And she, floating in the center of the light ball, was as captivating as a dancing spirit in the ice and snow. Unfortunately, she was a death spirit in the ice and snow.\n\nThe weather changed. With the environmental shift, the already abnormally powerful Dragon of the Ice Goddess attacked even more ferociously. At this point, the Grand Elder realized things were not good and shouted at the four dispatched by the First Prince, Yan Ji, \"Give it your all! If we don't destroy this Level 11 Forbidden Spell before she completes the Divine Descent, we will all be finished.\"\n\nLights of various colors began to shine from all eleven of them, each ball of light burning with all their energy. Three Magus Masters resolutely retreated and began chanting their strongest spells. The Second, Fifth, and Sixth Elders, although still Magus Masters, had cultivated in this field for countless years. Although they had not made the final breakthrough, they were undoubtedly the strongest among Magus Masters, and they too could cast Level 11 Forbidden Spells.\n\nThe battle energy surrounding the eight Martial Saints simultaneously turned silver. Sacred Battle Energy was their strongest power, and like a Forbidden Spell, it was also the method that consumed their battle energy the most. Eight beams of silver battle energy struck the breath of the Dragon of the Ice Goddess simultaneously. Under this full-power attack, the originally powerful Dragon of the Ice Goddess's light dimmed considerably. Simultaneously, the Ice Goddess Priestess, who was channeling a vast amount of magical power for the Divine Descent technique, stopped supplying power to the Dragon of the Ice Goddess. The lights from the three acupoints weakened simultaneously, and the three points of light, gold, silver, and blue, retreated and condensed into a transparent barrier around the Ice Goddess Priestess. Through the tri-colored light of gold, silver, and blue, her body became even more ethereal and filled with a mysterious aura.\n\nThe chanting was drowned out by the clash between the Dragon of the Ice Goddess and the eight Martial Saints. Only the Ice Goddess Priestess's voice remained clear, \"God said, salvation is God's responsibility. The pure Ice Goddess shall sweep away evil from the human world. All blasphemers! Awaken! God said, the mixture of ice and blood is the source of purity, just as water is the source of life, capable of cleansing all. The divine will of the Ice Goddess shall shine upon the land, bringing the purest aura to the world. Forbidden of Forbidden, Divine Descent - Snowfall.\"\n\nWith a deafening roar, the Dragon of the Ice Goddess was finally completely shattered. Under the attack of Sacred Battle Energy, without the immense magical power support from the Ice Goddess Priestess, it was unable to resist the full-power assault of the eight Martial Saints. Eight beams of silver battle energy struck the gold, silver, and blue lights protecting the Ice Goddess Priestess simultaneously. Magical elements and battle energy scattered, and below where the Ice Goddess Priestess floated, the reverberating aftermath formed a crater over thirty zhang in diameter and five zhang deep.\n\nHowever, by this point, no one could stop the Divine Descent technique. The thick dark clouds in the sky suddenly split open, and a beam of blue light shot down, enveloping the Ice Goddess Priestess's body. Inside the barrier, the Ice Goddess Priestess let out a muffled groan and spat out a mouthful of blood. In her hand, a crystal ball now appeared—a blue crystal ball.\n\nRings of blue halo spread outward from her body. Large swathes of snowflakes fell from the dark clouds in the sky. The wind had become violent, mixing with the snow, constantly condensing in the air. A miracle occurred: the snowflakes in mid-air formed a snow waterfall a hundred zhang wide, rushing down from the heavens. This was no longer just cold; it was not even real snowflakes. The light, entirely condensed from ice elements, was filled with the aura of death, clearing everything, which meant destroying everything. The true meaning of Divine Descent was precisely—destruction.\n\nThe Ice Goddess Priestess floated quietly in mid-air. The snow-composed waterfall parted naturally as it passed by her body. Wrapped in a blue halo, her expression remained cold, but her deep blue eyes were filled with fanaticism. Triggering a cataclysm of heaven and earth, the advent of the Divine Descent technique made her believe that all enemies who dared to blaspheme against her would be annihilated. Not only the eleven experts before her but even the five elite heavy crossbowmen of the Ice Moon Empire would not be spared. In her heart, there had never been a word like mercy. Anyone who dared to offend her had only one outcome: elimination, erased by her immense ice and snow power.\n\nExcept for the Ice Goddess Priestess, everyone present was witnessing the descent of the Divine Descent technique for the first time. The hundred-zhang-wide ice and snow waterfall descended from the sky, like the Milky Way falling from the Ninth Heaven. Before the snow waterfall even arrived, the immense pressure had already caused the solid heavy crossbows to collapse. These soldiers, though elites, what could they do against such world-shattering, destructive power? The extreme cold had already frozen their bodies before the snow waterfall arrived. Five thousand lives vanished into the ice and snow just like that. A torrent of resentment surged, but even resentment would dissipate in this extreme cold. Divine Descent, something that should not have appeared in the human world, its destructive nature was insurmountable.\n\nThe four Martial Saints sent by the First Prince's countenance changed drastically. Although their Sacred Battle Energy would not be intimidated by this immense pressure, they found their hearts turning as cold as the outside world, their mobility reduced to a minimum. They wanted to run, but could only move like ordinary people. However, the snow waterfall had already descended, fully descended.\n\nAlthough the Grand Elder was also seeing the Divine Descent technique for the first time, he had heard of the Ice Goddess Priestess's might when she performed Divine Descent in the past. Legend had it that the Ice Goddess Priestess's chanting lasted for a full half an hour. However, this time, the Forbidden Spells of the Second, Fifth, and Sixth Elders had only just been completed. Judging by the speed, this Divine Descent technique did not take much longer than chanting a Level 11 Forbidden Spell. The Grand Elder clearly felt that the Ice Goddess Priestess was no longer the same Divine Descent Master as before; years of cultivation had made her even more powerful.\n\nNian Bing did not fully understand the application of acupoints. When the Seven Dragon Kings learned that he had just opened his Sky Eye acupoint, and that the other acupoints would take a long time to open, they had not explained anything to him. However, the Ice Goddess Priestess was different. She knew how to use all the acupoints. The opening of the Huang Ji acupoint had brought her to an entirely new realm. To be precise, she was no longer simply a Mage. The three acupoints, on the Divine Continent, represented not gods, but Divinity. Yes, the Ice Goddess Priestess now possessed the qualifications to be called a god on the Divine Continent. If it weren't for the enemies she was facing today being too powerful, she would never have been able to sustain any injury.\n\nThree Level 11 Forbidden Spells—darkness, fire, and ice—were activated simultaneously. Ice and fire, in the face of true ice, vanished with almost no resistance. The Fifth and Sixth Elders spat out mouthfuls of blood simultaneously. Only with the protection of the Third and Fourth Elders did they not faint immediately, but their eyes revealed a look of fear.\n\nOnly the Second Elder's Dark Forbidden Spell provided some resistance. The Ice Goddess Priestess did not possess Nian Bing's ability to counter darkness with Shadow Puppets. When attributes did not counter each other, it relied on pure energy combat. Clearly, the energy of the Divine Descent technique was not something an ordinary Forbidden Spell could resist, not even the most overbearing Dark Forbidden Spell. The four Ultimate Dark Knights only delayed the snow waterfall for a few seconds before being reabsorbed by the deified ice elements. However, it was precisely these few seconds that gave the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion an opportunity.\n\nThe Grand Elder gave the retreat signal without hesitation. Although their delaying mission was not perfectly completed, they had at least slowed the Ice Goddess Priestess's advance. At this point, he understood very clearly that on this Azure Sun Continent, no human could contend with the Ice Goddess Priestess before them. The Divine Descent technique truly lived up to the power of a god!\n\nSeven silver lights shone in the despairing eyes of the four Martial Saints under the First Prince. Although the Divine Descent Snowfall could block most magical elements, it could not block magical scrolls that were themselves condensed from magical elements. Seven silver lights carried away seven figures. At the same time, those four unfortunate Martial Saints had disappeared. Their bodies turned to dust in the snow condensed from ice elements, merging with the ice. Under the divine aura of ice, not even the dregs of their souls were left.\n\nWhere the snow waterfall passed, it left a forbidden zone ten kilometers long and one kilometer wide. All animals, plants, and even the people before them vanished within this forbidden zone. Looking around, all that could be seen was a straight white path. The aura of ice caused the Ice Moon Empire to enter winter prematurely, not just at the location where the Divine Descent technique was cast, but in every corner of the Ice Moon Empire. Winter arrived exceptionally early this year, and it also arrived exceptionally fiercely. All of this was caused by the Divine Descent technique.",

    "content": "The blue halo gradually faded, and the Ice Goddess Priestess's flawless face turned as white as the snow on the ground. She floated down, swaying slightly, and managed to support herself with a magic staff that had appeared in her hand, preventing her from falling. By using the innate energy to cast the forbidden spell \"Dragon of the Ice Goddess\" to buy time, and then immediately casting the Descent Spell without pause, even her immense magical power was difficult to sustain. She couldn't help but feel fortunate; although her vital energy was injured, the wounds were not severe. It was mainly her magic power that was greatly depleted. She knew clearly that if she hadn't activated the Imperial Pole acupoint during this secluded cultivation, even though she would still have won this battle, the price would have been much higher. The Imperial Pole acupoint, as expected, possessed the strongest offensive power among the seven acupoints.\n\nClosing her eyes, in the icy and snowy environment, the Ice Goddess Priestess quietly recovered her magic power. The surroundings were filled with the aura of ice elements, and the pure ice elements left by the residual snow quickly restored three-tenths of her magical power, while her internal injuries also lessened significantly.\n\nJust then, not far behind the Ice Goddess Priestess, a patch of snow moved, and a person emerged from it. It was the messenger from before. At this moment, his face was frozen a purplish-blue, and his entire body was trembling uncontrollably. If not for the battle qi he had cultivated since childhood protecting his internal organs, he would likely have turned into an ice sculpture by now.\n\nThe Descent Spell – even with the Ice Goddess Priestess's vast mental power, she could only control the direction of the attack. It was only after the Descent Spell that the messenger managed to cling to his life. He had seen everyone who had attacked the Ice Goddess Priestess earlier and was well aware of their strength. However, before the Descent Spell, a full five thousand people had simply vanished. Looking at the Ice Goddess Priestess's graceful back standing a hundred paces away, his body trembled even more violently. She was a god, not a human. At this moment, this was the only thought in the messenger's mind.\n\n\"Master.\" Dozens of figures rushed towards the Ice Goddess Priestess with the wind and snow. Flying at the forefront was Bing Yun, controlling a blizzard.\n\nThe Ice Goddess Priestess slowly opened her eyes. Although she was still very weak and her vital energy was far from being restored to its optimal state, with the three-tenths of her restored magic power, she was enough to contend with a Magister and win easily.\n\nSeeing Bing Yun's panicked expression, a rare smile appeared on the Ice Goddess Priestess's face. Bing Yun soon arrived in front of her and landed. She walked a few steps towards her master, then knelt down with a thud, sobbing, \"Master, Bing Yun is late. Are you, are you alright?\"\n\nThe Ice Goddess Priestess helped Bing Yun up from the ground and said calmly, \"Do you think anyone on this continent can harm me?\" Although she was indeed injured, her pride made her unwilling to admit such a fact.\n\nBing Yun visibly relaxed and looked back at the members of the Ice God Tower who had followed her. At this moment, these mages of the Ice God Tower were all kneeling on the ground, not daring to raise their heads, fearing that the Ice Goddess Priestess would vent her anger upon them. \"Master, we were waiting at the north gate of Ice Moon City to welcome your arrival. But just now, I suddenly saw the celestial phenomenon change here and felt your aura, so I knew something was amiss. Who was it that made you use the Descent Spell?\"\n\nThe Ice Goddess Priestess's expression turned cold, and she said in a low voice, \"Who else could it be but the subordinates of those princes from the Ice Moon Empire. However, I didn't expect these princes to have such great influence, actually inviting three Magisters, one Martial-Magic Saint, and seven Martial Saints. If it weren't for so many experts coming, how could I have used the Descent Spell? Bing Yun, what is the situation in Ice Moon City?\"\n\nBing Yun was stunned for a moment and shook her head. \"I don't know. Didn't you teach your disciple not to interfere in the affairs of the Ice Moon Empire?\"\n\n\"I know, it must be the First Prince's people.\" The messenger, under the effect of battle qi, had recovered somewhat. He quickly came behind the Ice Goddess Priestess and said respectfully.\n\nA cold light flashed in the Ice Goddess Priestess's eyes. \"Very well! Well done, First Prince, even plotting against me. Let's go, to Ice Moon City. I want to see what other surprises this First Prince can bring me.\"\n\nRudolf did not come with Bing Yun. Due to the influence of the snow cascade, the temperature outside the north gate of Ice Moon City dropped sharply. Apart from these ice-element mages, even Martial Saints as powerful as Rudolf felt uncomfortable. However, Rudolf didn't expect that at the same time as the celestial phenomenon change outside the city, the Fifth Prince, whom Yan Tiannan had asked him to protect, had already lost his life. Everything was proceeding according to the Blood Lion Cult's plan.\n\nUnderground of the Ice Moon Empire Palace.\n\nThe First Prince, who had been advancing in darkness, could only see the light ahead with the help of the magic gemstones he carried. The dampness and darkness underground made him uncomfortable, but even if it were twice as uncomfortable, he could endure it. His mood was very tense, mixed with a bit of excitement. Would he succeed today? Once successful, he would achieve his dream. He assumed his subordinates had already launched a fierce attack on the palace, and the inner palace was currently the most empty. That guest official of Marshal Xuepo was truly a marvel. He had actually thought of a way to advance underground to avoid the traps on the surface. Moreover, he had found such a strange magical beast. After he ascended the throne, he would have to make good use of this person.\n\nAs he was lost in thought, the Dark Demon Rats, which had been advancing rapidly ahead, suddenly stopped. Immediately after, the huge bodies of the Dark Demon Rats began to burrow upwards. The fresh air, accompanied by sunlight, shot down from above, making the stifled First Prince feel much more comfortable. Ah! Finally, we're here! The tension in his heart lessened considerably at this moment, while his excitement greatly increased.\n\n\"Charge out with me! As long as we succeed today, all participating members will be rewarded with one hundred gold coins!\" he said, leading dozens of experts to charge out of the hole first. Behind them were five hundred Blood Guards led by Yin Dang, the hall master of the Ice Moon Hall of the Blood Lion Cult.\n\nYin Dang did not rush. He signaled to the Blood Guards behind him, and all the Blood Guards stopped in unison, not making a sound. The massive body of the Dark Demon Rat transformed into energy and disappeared into the gemstone of the Demonic Devouring Blade held by the Shadow Puppet. The Shadow Puppet flickered and moved towards the depths of the palace. It was like a faint wisp of black smoke; no one could catch up to its speed.\n\nYin Dang heard shouts and the clashing of weapons from above. A cold light flashed in his eyes, and he said in a low voice, \"Relay the order! All Blood Guards charge into the palace, minimizing losses. Quickly!\" After saying this, he rushed out first, charging onto the ground protected by his Saint Battle Qi at the Martial Saint level.\n\nThe Blood Guards of the Blood Lion Hall were identically dressed, each wearing a tight, dark red outfit, with a vivid red lion embroidered on the left chest. The edges of the embroidery were outlined with gold thread. Their weapons were also the same: rapier, like venomous snakes, completely black rapier. The blackness of the rapier not only prevented reflection of light but also, each rapier carried a lethal poison that sealed the throat with blood. That poison was both for the enemy and for themselves.\n\nThe five hundred Blood Guards moved extremely fast, forming a sharp cone in the blink of an eye. At this moment, the experts under the First Prince had already dealt with the first wave of enemies after reaching the surface. Yan Ji, too preoccupied to reprimand the Blood Guards for their slow arrival, immediately led his men to charge into the palace, leaving no life in their wake. He knew very well that time was crucial for him. Once the ten thousand Royal Guards solved the cannon fodder outside and came to their rescue, he would have no chance with these few hundred men.\n\nThe charge towards the inner palace did not encounter much resistance. Although the guards left behind by the Royal Guard were equally formidable, they were far inferior in both numbers and strength compared to the five hundred Blood Guards meticulously trained by the Blood Lion Hall. The general strength of the Blood Guards was not very high, but they were extremely insidious and venomous. Relying on their poisoned swords and incredibly fast speed, they advanced without any pause. In the blink of an eye, they had charged into the inner palace. Yan Ji was overjoyed to see the bravery of the Blood Guards. He hadn't expected everything to go so smoothly. He was unaware that Rudolf had already taken away most of the elite of the Royal Guard. The place where the Dark Demon Rats appeared was the central area of the inner palace. Without wasting more time, they had already reached near Yan Tiannan's sleeping quarters. To Yan Ji's distress, the Blood Guards had indeed followed his orders before he came here, leaving no one alive. Even the attractive maids were not spared. For a time, the entire palace was filled with an aura of slaughter.\n\nThe Shadow Puppet, under the mental control of Nian Bing, was originally preparing to return to Nian Bing's side. His body, which flashed into the palace, suddenly stopped. He looked at the Demonic Devouring Blade in his hand with suspicion. The Demonic Devouring Blade trembled violently, and with a flash of light, the enormous body of the Dark Demon Rat broke free from the control of the Demonic Devouring Blade and appeared on the ground.\n\nThe Shadow Puppet stared blankly at the Dark Demon Rat. Just as he was about to forcibly retrieve the Dark Demon Rat into the Demonic Devouring Blade, the ground in front of him suddenly moved, and a black, squirming body burrowed out from underground. It was a black rat with the exact same appearance as the Dark Demon Rat, only tens of times smaller. With a flash of light, a large cockroach burrowed out from behind the black rat. The large cockroach emitted a layer of black aura, and a little girl emerged from the black light.\n\n\"Tiantian, Brother Nian Bing is not here. Why did you come out?\" This suddenly appearing girl was Maomao. She looked around, didn't find Nian Bing, and couldn't help but chide Tiantian with dissatisfaction.\n\nThe Dark Demon Rat Tiantian let out a sharp squeak and lunged towards the huge Dark Demon Rat. The giant Dark Demon Rat, which had broken free from the Demonic Devouring Blade, also let out a series of squeaks, rubbing its head against Tiantian's body while lying on the ground.\n\nMaomao was stunned for a moment. \"Wow, isn't this the fifth-tier Dark Demon Rat that Brother Nian Bing subdued? Did I guess correctly, is it your mother?\"\n\nTiantian nestled beside the large Dark Demon Rat and nodded repeatedly, her eyes showing extreme intimacy. Dark Demon Rats are extremely sensitive to scents, especially when there is a blood connection. These two Dark Demon Rats, one large and one small, were reunited as mother and child in this situation.\n\nBecause the Shadow Puppet's speed was extremely fast, he was the first to arrive here. At this moment, the massive body of the Dark Demon Rat immediately attracted the attention of the palace guards, and a large number of guards swarmed towards them. Just then, the First Prince Yan Ji and the Blood Guards arrived.\n\nFor the first time in her life, Maomao witnessed a terrifying scene. Blood almost stained every corner of the ground, and lives vanished before her eyes.\n\nMaomao's expression was first dazed, then she let out a scream and fainted.\n\nThe Shadow Puppet was startled. His seemingly solid body moved, and he actually let out a deep voice: \"Fainted, it seems only I can send her back.\" His voice was very deep, filled with the aura of death. A gleam flashed in his eyes as he looked at Tiantian and Qiangqiang, the cockroach. \"Since you two can bring her here, you can also take her back. Lead the way.\"\n\nTiantian and Qiangqiang's bodies trembled, but neither dared to disobey the Shadow Puppet's orders. The cockroach once again carried Maomao on its back. Tiantian, with a hint of reluctance, glanced at her mother, whom she had just recognized, before burrowing back underground. The Shadow Puppet floated onto the back of the large Dark Demon Rat, which then burrowed into the ground, following behind Tiantian and Qiangqiang.\n\nNian Bing, in the palace, suddenly felt a jolt. He was surprised to find that he had lost contact with the Shadow Puppet again. However, he also sensed that the First Prince and his group had already reached the inner palace. He couldn't help but feel a bit confused. What was going on with his Shadow Puppet? If he knew that his energy-formed Shadow Puppet could speak, who knew what kind of surprise he would have.\n\nYan Tiannan lay peacefully on his bed, but his expression was very grim. Although his illness had been temporarily stabilized with the support of Nian Bing's innate energy, the news of the outer palace being attacked had caused him great anger and anxiety. Of course, he understood that this was the work of his eldest son. Yan Ji's audacity greatly disappointed him. Yan Feng, as if completely unaware of everything happening outside, quietly comforted his father. Yan Tiannan also believed that even though three thousand elite Royal Guards had left, with the remaining seven thousand, even if the fifty thousand strong army of the Ice Moon Guard attacked, they wouldn't be able to break through the palace's defenses. And the Ice Goddess Priestess was about to arrive. Once she came, all current crises would be easily resolved.",

    "content": "As Yan Tiannan's emotions churned, with a *bang*, the imperial bedchamber door was kicked open. Dozens of blood-red figures, accompanied by a pale silver light, immediately attacked the eight guards inside. These eight guards were all Martial Artists, but under the poisoned swords of the Blood Guards and the Martial Saint-level attack of Yin Dang, they were quickly injured. Faced with poisoned swords, even a slight wound would result in only one outcome: death.\n\nAfter the Blood Guards dealt with the eight guards, they didn't stop. They swiftly killed all the maids within the imperial palace. Only then did they line up neatly in two rows outside. The inner palace was breached in less than the time it takes to eat a meal. At this time, the many experts of the Royal Guard outside had not yet received the news. How could those who occasionally arrived be a match for the Blood Guards outside?\n\nYan Ji, dressed in military attire, walked in from outside. He had deliberately donned a golden-yellow battle suit today, his scarlet cape defiantly billowing behind him in the wind. The moment he entered the bedchamber, he suddenly felt filled with the sense of ruling the world. This feeling was so wonderful. Finally, it was obtained. Everything he had longed for for many years was now before his eyes. Yan Ji's heart was almost bursting with excitement. He strode with firm yet slightly trembling steps towards the massive dragon couch within the bedchamber.\n\nYan Feng suddenly stood up. Weapons were not allowed in the imperial palace. He released his battle qi externally, stood before the bed, and stared at Yan Ji. Yan Ji smiled faintly and said, \"Hello, Seventh Brother. I have something to say to Father Emperor. You should step aside first.\"\n\nBefore Yan Feng could reply, Yin Dang by his side suddenly darted forward, delivering a palm chop to Yan Feng's neck. Yan Feng's body went limp, and he immediately collapsed to the ground. Yan Ji was stunned for a moment and looked at Yin Dang with some doubt. Yin Dang whispered, \"Your Highness, now is not the time to delay. Let's resolve everything quickly.\"\n\nYan Ji, his heart filled with excitement, didn't think much of it. He let Yin Dang move Yan Feng's body aside, stepped forward two paces, and walked before the couch. Although Nian Bing had changed his clothes today, Yan Ji still recognized his demeanor. Nian Bing gently nodded to Yan Tiannan behind him, signaling that he could begin.\n\nYan Tiannan's face had turned somewhat pale green with anger. He raised a trembling finger and pointed at Yan Ji, \"Good, good! Are you bringing so many people into the imperial palace to rebel?\"\n\nYan Ji smiled faintly and said, \"No, I am of the royal family. What is there to rebel about? Father Emperor, I am only here today to take back what rightfully belongs to me. This is not excessive, is it? Perhaps you are wondering how I got in. You underestimate your son too much. Since you are not benevolent, how can you blame me for being unrighteous? If I remember correctly, you used the same methods to ascend the throne back then. Your son has inherited your glorious tradition.\" He waved his hand, and Yin Dang immediately led the Blood Guards to retreat. Only the experts Yan Ji had brought remained in the bedchamber.\n\n\"You...\" Yan Tiannan felt his vision go black and immediately spat out a mouthful of blood. Nian Bing behind him quickly increased the input of his innate qi, stabilizing his injuries.\n\nYan Tiannan sighed deeply, \"Retribution, truly retribution! I never expected to end up in such a state. Where is Fifth Brother? Has he been harmed by you?\"\n\nYan Ji let out a cold laugh and said, \"Father Emperor, I just don't understand. We are both your sons, why are you so partial? Clearly, I am the eldest son, yet you insist on passing the throne to Fifth Brother. As I came here, your fifth son has probably gone to find Second Brother. In any case, I must avenge my second brother. Father Emperor! Now only I can inherit your throne. Perhaps you will think I am despicable, but my despicable nature flows with your blood. You no longer have a choice. Issue the imperial decree.\" As he spoke of Yan Tiannan's favoritism towards Yan Yun, a trace of venom appeared in his eyes.\n\nYan Tiannan's whole body trembled, and tears streamed down his face, \"Yun'er is dead, Yun'er is also dead! Retribution, truly retribution! When I vied for the throne, didn't I kill my own brothers? I never expected that in my old age, retribution would befall me. Fine, Yan Ji, you are ruthless! Do you know why I don't like you? Because your vision is too short-sighted; you can only see immediate benefits. Yun'er is much smarter than you, at least his vision is much more far-reaching. He is excellent in all aspects. If he were to inherit my position, the Ice Moon Empire would surely become even stronger, but you cannot.\"\n\nYan Ji was furious, \"Even at this point, you haven't forgotten that scoundrel. He even killed Second Brother, and you call that far-sighted?\"\n\nYan Tiannan looked coldly at Yan Ji, \"It wasn't Yun'er who killed Yin'er. I understand Yun'er's character; he wouldn't do such a foolish thing. If Yin'er hadn't died, and Yun'er hadn't been pressured from all sides, you might not have had this opportunity today.\"\n\nYan Ji was getting impatient. Although eleven experts had been sent to assassinate the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, he still felt a bit uneasy in his heart. Once the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess arrived, he would have no chance.\n\n\"Saying these things now is meaningless. My great Father Emperor, it is time for you to abdicate this position. Even if I am as short-sighted as you say, with Second and Fifth Brothers dead, no one is more suitable for your position than I am. Regardless, I am your son, inheriting the purest bloodline of the Yan royal family. There's no need to say more, you should write the imperial decree.\" With that, he winked at his subordinates, and someone immediately presented a blank imperial decree to Yan Tiannan. As long as he had the imperial decree and the Ice Moon Empire's Imperial Seal, he could be considered to have secured the emperor's throne. Given the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's character of never participating in imperial politics, even if she arrived, she couldn't change the facts. Yan Ji had sent suicide squads; even if the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess guessed he was the culprit, she would never find any evidence.\n\nYan Tiannan's face regained a rosy hue, and his spirit suddenly seemed to improve. Nian Bing behind him clearly felt his metabolism accelerating. Nian Bing understood that this was a sign of a final surge of energy before death, and Yan Tiannan's body could no longer hold on. Yan Tiannan could not die yet. He quickly increased the input of his innate qi and, using his mimicry magic, simultaneously infused healing water and light element into his body, sustaining his broken body.\n\n\"What if I don't write this imperial decree? Only I know the location of the Imperial Seal. I had already anticipated today, so I have hidden the Imperial Seal. As long as you cannot get the Imperial Seal, you can never ascend the throne.\" Yan Tiannan's voice became even colder. As he spoke, he glanced back at Nian Bing, a trace of gratitude in his eyes.\n\nYan Ji drew the sword at his waist with a swish, his face contorted into a ferocious expression, \"Father Emperor, then don't blame me for disregarding our father-son relationship.\"\n\nYan Tiannan revealed a bitter smile, \"Father-son relationship? You are not worthy of saying those four words. I am about to die, and whether I die sooner or later makes no difference. Kill me if you have the ability! If the royal family is so degenerate, I would rather watch the Ice Moon Empire fall into chaos than pass the throne to you, a beast who kills brothers and fathers.\"\n\nYan Ji was stunned for a moment. He then realized that Yan Tiannan was not afraid of death. What was there to fear for a dying person? Gradually, a sinister smile appeared on his face, \"Father Emperor, you are too naive. I have been planning for so many years. Do you think I have no other way if you don't hand over those things? I have already prepared a fake imperial decree and a fake Imperial Seal. Even if you don't hand over the items from the east, they won't be able to leave the palace. I will ascend the throne first, and then I can search for them slowly. Since you wish to die, I will send you to find Fifth Brother.\" In reality, he should not have killed Yan Tiannan at this moment, or at least not personally, otherwise, how could the body of Yan Tiannan, left with injuries, not reveal clues? However, Yan Ji was now driven somewhat mad by the lust for power and, disregarding everything, thrust his sword forward, stabbing towards Yan Tiannan.\n\nYan Tiannan was filled with unwillingness, but with his severely ill body, how could he dodge? He glared resentfully at his own son, waiting for the moment of death to arrive.\n\nJust at this critical juncture, a figure suddenly rushed over from the side, \"No, you cannot kill Father Emperor.\"\n\nWith a *plop*, blood splattered. Yan Ji's long sword pierced directly into the chest of Yan Feng, who had been knocked out earlier but had suddenly lunged forward. Blood stained Yan Feng's collar. A smile appeared on Yan Feng's face, a smile that seemed to be of liberation.\n\nYan Ji was shocked and exclaimed, \"Seventh Brother, what are you doing?\" Although he had no affection for Yan Feng, Xue Po had great value for him, which was why he treated Yan Feng with courtesy. However, he never expected that Yan Feng, who should have been on his side, would suddenly rush forward to block the sword.\n\nYan Tiannan, lying on the bed, had his face smeared with the blood gushing from behind Yan Feng. He clearly saw the tip of the sword piercing through Yan Feng's back. For a moment, his resentment turned into panic, \"No, Feng'er, why are you so foolish!\"\n\nJust then, Nian Bing moved. He gracefully moved away from Yan Tiannan's back and struck Yan Feng's back with his palm. With a *puff*, a surge of pure light element was instantly infused into Yan Feng's body, knocking Yan Ji's long sword flying. At the same time, under the effect of the light element, the gushing blood was immediately stopped.\n\nYan Feng's body went limp and began to fall to the ground. Yan Tiannan, on the bed, cried out, \"Mister, you must save my son.\"\n\nNian Bing infused both water and light, two magical elements full of healing properties, into Yan Feng's body simultaneously, instantly mending his injuries. However, due to the sudden loss of blood, Yan Feng's face turned extremely pale, and his body lay weakly in Nian Bing's embrace.\n\nYan Ji naturally did not stop Nian Bing's actions; he did not want Yan Feng to die either. At this moment, Yan Tiannan, no longer supported by Nian Bing behind him, lay back down on the bed. A glimmer of warmth appeared in his despairing eyes. He had never imagined that any of his sons would be willing to sacrifice their lives for him, but this son, whom he had always forgotten, had done so. His heart ached, aching because of Yan Ji, and also aching because of Yan Feng. He deeply regretted not being able to see through everything. He had now forgotten everything, his gaze fixed solely on Yan Feng, praying for this son who was truly his son.\n\nYan Tiannan had abandoned all restraint, but Yan Ji had not forgotten his goal. He wielded his long sword again, the blade emitting a bright light. This time, he had used his battle qi, determined to kill Yan Tiannan. With a flick of his wrist, a beam of battle qi light directly slashed towards Yan Tiannan on the bed, who had no power to resist.\n\nYan Tiannan did not see Yan Ji's attack; his eyes were fixed only on Yan Feng, the son willing to sacrifice his life for him.\n\nHowever, Yan Tiannan did not see it, but Nian Bing did. Without any warning, a seven-colored light drifted out, its faint glow like a viscous liquid. Even a Martial Saint's attack would be significantly weakened within Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye domain, let alone the First Prince Yan Ji. His battle qi, compared to his insidious nature, was far too inferior. Without any suspense, the battle qi vanished.\n\nYan Ji was startled. Before he could react, Nian Bing, having finished tending to Yan Feng's injuries, stood up. At this moment, his eyes were filled with terrifying killing intent. Nian Bing's greatest pain was losing his parents since childhood, so even if Yan Feng's actions of prioritizing family affection affected his world-changing plan, he would not regret it. At the same time, Yan Ji, who was actually about to kill his father with his own hands, also filled his heart with anger. How he wished he could be with his father! And this scumbag before him dared to attack his father.\n\nAs Yan Ji was about to attack, he suddenly felt his entire body jolt. His body seemed to freeze, surrounded by something unknown. Six light figures simultaneously separated from Nian Bing's body, like his clones. In an instant, amplified to the fastest speed within the Heavenly Eye domain that encompassed the entire bedchamber, each light figure carried a blade of a different color.\n\nThe blade light drew dazzling lines in the air. Each line clearly carried a blood-red glow. The experts who had followed Yan Ji turned into corpses within this faint cold light. Their deaths were all the same: each had an extra opening on their neck. Some openings spewed blood, some were frozen, and some were completely charred. These were the results of pure six-elemental magic. The magical blade light from the six divine blades became the judge that pronounced their doom.",

    "content": "Yan Ji wanted to speak, but a tremendous pressure hit him. He saw Nian Bing's eyes, pure azure blue with no impurities. Nian Bing's eyes were so deep that Yan Ji was stunned, his soul completely suppressed by the mental energy emanating from the Heavenly Eye acupoint. The last thing Yan Ji saw in his life was the young man he wanted to win over, a streak of white light about an inch long suddenly illuminating the space between his eyebrows. Then, that white light opened, revealing a silver eye – yes, a silver eye.\n\nNian Bing struck out with his hand. He didn't use magic, because he felt that would be too easy for Yan Ji. Although he didn't know any martial arts, his lifelong practice of cooking had made his movements many times faster than ordinary people. While he couldn't manipulate his body for difficult poses like Oscar, facing a target that couldn't move at all, his dragon physique and dragon strength became Crown Prince Yan Ji's death warrant.\n\nBoom! With a loud bang, Yan Ji clearly heard his own ribs break. His battle qi ultimately had an element, and under the restraint of the Heavenly Eye domain, it couldn't provide any protective effect. Even if he could use battle qi, his cultivation level might not have been enough to withstand a punch from Nian Bing's dragon body.\n\nThe intense pain plunged Yan Ji into darkness. Gradually, his body went numb. He felt extremely cold, and what appeared before his eyes seemed to be hell, a hell filled with blood…\n\nWatching Yan Ji's collapsed chest and the spray of blood mist, Nian Bing felt a sense of excitement. But he didn't stop or dwell on this feeling. He quickly returned to the bedside and helped Yan Tiannan up, increasing the input of his innate qi and pulling Yan Tiannan, who was on the brink of death, back.\n\nYan Tiannan gasped for air. After Nian Bing's support was lost, he felt as though his soul was about to leave his body. Fortunately, Nian Bing rushed back in time and pulled his soul back.\n\nNian Bing sighed and said, \"Your Majesty, you are shaken. I killed your son.\"\n\nYan Tiannan showed a hint of a smile. \"I was not a good father. It's good that you killed him. Perhaps in the underworld, I can teach him how to be a person again. I can also learn how to be a person myself. May I know your name?\"\n\nNian Bing was taken aback because he felt the same brilliance from Yan Tiannan as he did from his own father. \"My name is Nian Bing.\"\n\nYan Tiannan smiled and nodded. \"Thank you, thank you. I'm not thanking you for saving me, but for saving my only son. Only he is worthy of being my son.\" Yan Tiannan looked at Yan Feng, who was struggling to get up, with a benevolent gaze.\n\nYan Feng, although still feeling extremely weak after Nian Bing's treatment, was much better than before. \"Your Majesty, you should rest first,\" he managed to say.\n\nYan Tiannan shook his head slightly. \"No, let me speak. If I don't say it now, I might truly lose my chance.\" His complexion became more ruddy. Although Nian Bing increased the input of his innate qi and used the magical elements of ice and light to heal him, Nian Bing deeply understood that this seemingly awakened elder could no longer continue his life.\n\nYan Feng's eyes turned red. Looking at Yan Tiannan, who was nearing the end of his life, he choked out, \"Your Majesty, do you know how long I've waited for you to call me son? Since childhood, only mother truly loved and cared for me, but she passed away like that. Your Majesty, do you know how much I yearned for your fatherly love?\"\n\nYan Tiannan looked at Yan Feng kindly. \"I know, and I understand, child. The mistakes this father has made in this life can only be made up for in the next. Remember my words, live well, be a good emperor, not like me, leaving so many troubles. I believe that with your kind heart, you will do better than me. Child! Do you know how satisfied I am in my heart right now? I don't even hate your elder brother anymore because today I have finally seen the family affection I have longed for. From the day I was born, I have been making mistakes, but the most correct thing I did was to rape your mother after drinking that time and bring you into this world. Your father couldn't compensate you before, but now that they are all dead, all your father can do is pass on what they wanted to you. Are you willing?\"\n\nAlthough Yan Feng and Nian Bing had already planned this entire operation, at this moment, his throat was so choked up that he couldn't utter the word \"willing.\" Seeing Yan Tiannan's fading gaze, tears uncontrollably streamed from Yan Feng's eyes.\n\nWith a bang, the door outside was kicked open, and a large number of guards rushed in. Leading them were Rudolf, the captain of the Royal Guard, as well as the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess and Bing Yun.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Rudolf cried out mournfully and rushed to the bedside with utmost speed. When they discovered that the Fifth Prince Yan Yun had died tragically in the mansion, they sensed something was wrong. After rushing back as quickly as possible, with the help of the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess and many experts from the Ice God Tower, they quickly cleared out Yan Ji's subordinates who were continuously attacking outside the imperial palace. Rudolf felt a strong premonition and charged into the imperial palace. When he saw the corpses in the inner palace, his heart was filled with shock. He knew that the thing he feared most had happened. He had not encountered any obstacles because the Blood Lion Sect's Blood Guards, after eliminating all the remaining Royal Guard members in the inner palace, had slowly retreated through the passage opened by Shu Heishu. As they rushed into the bedchamber, Rudolf's heart was filled with grief.\n\n\"I'm not dead yet, why are you crying?\" Yan Tiannan smiled faintly as he looked at Rudolf, who had rushed to the bedside. He had seen through everything now; death was not frightening to him.\n\nBing Yun looked at Nian Bing, who was supporting Yan Tiannan, with suspicion. Nian Bing nodded gently at her. Seeing the surprise in Bing Yun's eyes, he wanted to smile, but Yan Tiannan's words kept echoing in his ears, making it impossible for him to smile.\n\nYan Tiannan's gaze turned to the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess. \"You have come.\"\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess flashed and appeared before Yan Tiannan's bed. \"It seems I haven't come too late.\"\n\nNian Bing finally saw the enemy in his heart. The Ice and Snow Goddess's exquisite beauty could not diminish his hatred in the slightest. He quickly lowered his head, afraid that the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess would see his eyes filled with hatred.\n\nYan Tiannan smiled faintly. \"Thanks to this gentleman brought by Feng'er who eliminated the rebels, I can see you one last time. Priestess, I am about to depart. I hope you can uphold justice for the Ice Moon Empire, alright?\"\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess was stunned by the sincere smile on Yan Tiannan's face. She had known Yan Tiannan for a long time, and this was the first time she had seen such a pure smile on his face. Subconsciously, she nodded.\n\nYan Tiannan took a deep breath, mustered his strength, and spoke intermittently. \"Yan… Ji, in order to contend for… the throne… murdered… his own… brother… a grave sin. Lu… dolf, cleanse… his… remnants, that will be… up to you… I am… no longer able… But… I have… found… my… only… son… When Yan… Ji was… about to kill me… Feng'er… used his own body to block… his… sword… He has proven… everything… to me… with his actions… From… now on… I hereby… declare… Feng'er… shall inherit… the throne… of the Ice Moon… Empire… and become the new… emperor. … I trouble… Priestess… and Rudolf… you must… assist him… well…. Do you know?… Although I… am about to die… today… is the happiest… day… for me… to die like this… I am… very… satisfied…\" He breathed his last, his voice weak, pointing to his pillow, and died in Nian Bing's arms. His life force gone, he closed his eyes peacefully, a faint smile on his face, two tears sliding down his cheeks. His complex life had finally ended.\n\nSilence. The bedchamber was filled with silence. At this moment, everyone was stunned.\n\n\"Fa–ther–Em–per–or—\" Yan Feng cried out mournfully. The sword that he had blocked for Yan Tiannan, after suddenly waking from a coma, was something he and Nian Bing had planned long ago. Otherwise, how could he have woken up at the opportune moment and not been hit in a vital spot? But when Yan Tiannan truly died before his eyes, Yan Feng's heart was filled with grief. His vision darkened, and he fainted. Nian Bing stood up and carefully laid Yan Tiannan flat on the bed. No matter what mistakes he had made in his life, at least his final decision was very correct.\n\nEverything had been completed according to Nian Bing's plan, but he felt no excitement. Seeing all the darkness in the imperial palace, he suddenly longed to leave this city and find Feng Nu, find Long Ling, and search for his parents.\n\nEverything had ended, and with the end came a new beginning. With the support of the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess and based on Yan Tiannan's final oral decree issued by Rudolf, Yan Feng became the new emperor of the Ice Moon Empire. His ascension naturally drew dissatisfaction from many, especially the Empress and the direct descendants of the First Prince's faction. Upon learning that the First Prince Yan Ji had died, the Empress, driven mad, prepared to stage a coup. However, the Ice Moon Guard, who had originally pledged allegiance to them, suddenly sided with Yan Feng. Marshal Xue Po of the Blood Devouring Rose also recalled his stationed army. After a month of bloody suppression in Ice Moon City, this turmoil was finally quelled. In this turmoil, as many as one-third of the officials disappeared from the political stage of the Ice Moon Empire. And in the imperial palace of the Ice Moon Empire, Yan Tiannan's former consorts also disappeared under Yan Feng's iron-fisted methods. All of this was carried out in extreme secrecy. When Yan Feng held the Empress's head to mourn his mother, he changed. He was no longer the Yan Feng of the past but had become the true emperor of the Ice Moon Empire, the new emperor.\n\nA month later, after everything had stabilized, Yan Feng issued several decrees: First, establish the Ice Moon Imperial Military Department, to command Xue Po, and oversee the national army. The marshal who supported Crown Prince Yan Ji was executed for rebelling with the Empress. The other marshal also retreated from the political stage after the death of the Fifth Prince he supported. All military power was temporarily placed under Xue Po's sole command. He enfeoffed Xue Po's daughter, Xue Yu, as the Imperial Empress. At the same time, Yan Feng announced his betrothal to Long Ling, the daughter of the President of the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild, and Nian Bing, and enfeoffed Nian Bing as the Chief Court Mage. This point did not receive opposition from the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess because of her status. Naturally, she was not interested in a minor official position. Although she had sensed Nian Bing's special magic that day, due to the tense situation, she didn't have time to question Nian Bing, and Bing Yun did not expose Nian Bing to her face.\n\nFollowing Xue Po's advice, Yan Feng continuously issued numerous new appointments. With the support of the Minister of Finance, he reorganized the previously chaotic political landscape, replacing everyone with Xue Po's people. He was, of course, unaware that more than eighty percent of these new appointees had the \"Blood Lion\" in their background. Yan Feng succeeded. As the leader of the Blood Lion Sect, Nian Bing also succeeded. Right under the nose of the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, he secretly controlled the entire Ice Moon Empire. It could be said that now, a command issued by Nian Bing, who was named \"Zi,\" was more effective than Yan Feng's.\n\nThe internal strife of the Ice Moon Empire ended, and at the same time, the matter concerning Long Ling also had the best possible outcome. During this month of upheaval, Nian Bing did not leave Ice Moon City. He did not see Bing Yun again, nor did he enter the imperial palace again. Even on the day Yan Feng enfeoffed him as the Chief Court Mage, he did not go. Today, he was in the secret chamber of the Ice Moon Hall, accompanying Cat Cat in her cultivation.\n\nNian Bing learned of the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's true strength through communication with the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion. When he guessed that the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess had already opened three acupoints and six senses, it forced him to prepare to implement his plan, which he had initially wanted to abandon after being stimulated by Yan Tiannan. He was now just waiting for an opportunity.\n\nBing Yun also did not go to find Ling Bing. The Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess remained in Ice Moon City to assist Yan Feng. Bing Yun always thought about telling her everything when her master decided to return to the Ice God Tower. Subconsciously, she wanted to delay everything, but little did she know that this delay prevented Nian Bing from being threatened by the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess and leaving, thus changing the destiny of Bing Yun's entire life.",

    "content": "\"Brother, I miss Father and Mother a little. They're really something, not even coming to find Cat-Cat.\" Cat-Cat lowered her head, looking at Nian Bing, who had just emerged from his cultivation.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Silly girl, how would Uncle Xi know where you are? Even if he wanted to find you, he couldn't.\"\n\nCat-Cat shook her head. \"No. Between us White People, as long as there's a close blood relation, we can sense each other's location. With Father's mental power, even if we were a thousand miles apart, he could find me. Is Father angry with Cat-Cat and doesn't want Cat-Cat anymore?\" That day, after Cat-Cat woke up, she found herself inexplicably back in her room, the hole in the ground even filled in. She truly didn't understand what had happened. The thought of the bloody scene she saw filled her with extreme fear, so she hadn't told Nian Bing about that day. She only asked Nian Bing to frequently have the Shadow Puppets, which had regained control, release the Great Dark Demonic Rats, so they could be reunited. Unfortunately, the Great Dark Demonic Rats had already been sealed by the Shadow Puppets, and Tientien and Cat-Cat had a master-servant contract, destined to keep this mother and son from truly being together.\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"How could that be? Uncle Xi loves you too much to abandon you. How about this, Cat-Cat, tomorrow Brother will send someone to take you home, okay?\"\n\nIf it were before, Cat-Cat would have come up with all sorts of excuses, but this time, she lightly nodded. It was the longest time she had ever been away from home, and she had played enough. Her strong longing for her parents made her wish she could go back right now.\n\n\"Brother, aren't you sending Cat-Cat home? Cat-Cat really wants to eat the things you make while going home.\"\n\nNian Bing ruffled Cat-Cat's soft, long hair and smiled. \"It's not that Brother doesn't want to send you home, it's just that Brother has too many things to do and cannot send you. Be good, Cat-Cat. If there's a chance in the future, Brother will definitely come to see you, okay?\"\n\nCat-Cat nodded. \"Alright then. Oh, Brother, if Cat-Cat leaves, will Sister Bing Yun come to arrest you? She promised Cat-Cat that as long as Cat-Cat is here, she won't arrest you. Maybe I should stay.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head. \"Don't worry, your Sister Bing Yun doesn't have the ability to arrest Brother yet. Brother might even capture her.\"\n\nCat-Cat asked confusedly, \"Brother Nian Bing, what exactly is going on between you and Sister Bing Yun? Can you not hurt Sister Bing Yun? Sister is a good person. Although she seems cold on the outside, Cat-Cat can feel that she is a good person.\" Cat-Cat's tone was very firm, and a hint of pleading appeared in her big eyes.\n\nNian Bing sighed softly. \"You won't understand our affairs. Brother will try not to hurt her.\" Although Cat-Cat was already sixteen, having grown up among White People, she was as pure as a blank piece of paper. Nian Bing didn't want any impurities to stain this blank paper, so even though Cat-Cat had asked him several times about him and Bing Yun, he hadn't revealed anything.\n\nThe next morning, Nian Bing ordered Yin Dang to lead a hundred Blood Lion Sect¹ experts to personally escort Cat-Cat home. He absolutely did not wish for Cat-Cat to suffer any harm. With Cat-Cat gone and the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion Sect also returning to the Blood Lion Sect Headquarters, Nian Bing was alone in the Ice Moon Hall, contemplating that it was time to begin his next move. For him, nothing was more important than saving his parents. With the Great Dark Demonic Rats, he had already decided not to confront the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess directly. Of course, this was all on the premise that his parents were truly not dead.\n\nIn the Ice Moon Empire² Royal Palace. In a secluded courtyard.\n\n\"Master, there's something Yun'er hasn't had a chance to tell you.\" Bing Yun stood beside the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, her head bowed.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess looked up at Bing Yun and said, \"Just say what you need to say.\"\n\nBing Yun hesitated and then said, \"This time, when I represented the Ice Moon Empire at the Hua Rong Empire³ competition, I discovered the Ice Snow Goddess Stone⁴.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's expression changed slightly. \"Did you retrieve it?\"\n\nBing Yun's pretty face flushed, and she shook her head. \"Master, this disciple is no match for that person. He won the final match.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess frowned. \"Being able to participate in that competition means he's not old. You actually lost? Does he possess an innate domain that can counteract your Ice Snow Goddess Domain?\"\n\nBing Yun shook her head. \"At that time, he didn't have an innate domain, but I still lost.\" Then, she simply recounted the situation during the competition, concealing the fact that she had been hit by Nian Bing's \"Nourishing Dragon Claw Hand\"⁵. \"...When I encountered him again, his strength had suddenly increased significantly, and I could see less and less of him. His innate domain had also awakened. I had a conversation with him, and he should be the son of Senior Sister Bing Ling from back then.\"\n\n*Bang!* The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess slammed the table fiercely. A sturdy solid wood table silently dissolved into a pile of ice powder. \"That bastard is actually still alive. And he has reached such a realm by relying on the Ice Snow Goddess Stone and the Fire God Stone⁶.\" Complex light flickered in her eyes, and even Bing Yun couldn't discern her master's current emotions.\n\n\"Do you know where he is?\" the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess asked coldly.\n\nBing Yun's heart skipped a beat, and she whispered, \"That day, the young man you saw in the palace, the one who saved the Ice Moon Empire's Emperor, was him.\"\n\n\"No wonder, no wonder I felt his magical aura was so strange that day. Hmm, Bing Yun, why didn't you say anything at the time?\"\n\nBing Yun was startled and quickly said, \"Master, the situation that day was special, I...\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess raised her hand to stop her from speaking further. \"Enough. You must remember, you are a disciple of the Ice God Tower⁷. You shouldn't have forgotten what I told you back then. Yun'er, my expectations for you are very high. I hope you don't disappoint me like your Senior Sister Bing Ling.\" Although her voice was calm, Bing Yun's body was already trembling under the pressure of her aura.\n\n\"Master, I belong to the Ice God Tower for life.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said indifferently, \"Now, go find this person. I want to see how outstanding he is that even you have become restless.\" The situation in the Ice Moon Empire had stabilized. The reason she hadn't left yet was to search for the seven experts who had attacked her and escaped. However, despite sending out all the experts of the Ice God Tower to search, there was no clue. When suppressing the remnants of the First Prince's forces, those seven experts did not appear, making her doubt.\n\nBing Yun dared not say more and quickly agreed before retreating. When she left the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's room, she suddenly felt a chill all over her body, and cold sweat had already covered her entire body.\n\nBing Yun didn't know where Nian Bing was, but she thought of someone who would definitely know: the new Emperor of the Ice Moon Empire, Yan Feng. From the fact that Nian Bing was with him that day and that he had appointed Nian Bing as the Chief Court Mage, it could be deduced. Therefore, she decided to go find Yan Feng first.\n\nFor over a month, Yan Feng had finally adapted to the life of an emperor. His hidden talents were fully displayed. Although there had been a great slaughter, the Ice Moon Empire had entered a stable phase. As he was looking through the memorials, an eunuch suddenly entered from outside and respectfully said, \"Your Majesty, Miss Bing Yun of the Ice God Tower requests an audience.\"\n\nYan Feng looked up, thinking, What does she want? Ever since he learned that Nian Bing's enemy was the Ice God Tower, he had always harbored some reservations about the Ice God Tower. Hearing that Bing Yun was coming, he couldn't help but feel a bit puzzled. However, etiquette must be observed; the stability of his imperial position was largely due to the support of the Ice God Tower. He nodded and said, \"Please invite Miss Bing Yun in.\"\n\nA moment later, Bing Yun, wearing a white veil, entered. Although Yan Feng had seen Bing Yun many times, each encounter with her clear, cold, and noble aura gave him a new feeling. \"Miss Bing Yun, what is it?\" Yan Feng made a gesture to be seated.\n\nBing Yun stopped about ten feet away from Yan Feng, bowed slightly, and said, \"Your Majesty, I wish to see Nian Bing. Can you tell me where he is?\"\n\nYan Feng's heart tightened, but outwardly he smiled and said, \"Oh? Miss Bing Yun wants to see Nian Bing? I haven't seen him since we parted in the palace that day, so I don't know where he is. May I ask if you are looking for him, or is it the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess who is looking for him?\"\n\nBing Yun frowned slightly. \"Your Majesty, you seem to know something.\"\n\nYan Feng said noncommittally, \"Perhaps. However, I truly don't know where Nian Bing is.\" What a joke! Since he knew Nian Bing had enmity with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, how could he possibly reveal Nian Bing's whereabouts?\n\nBing Yun gave Yan Feng a deep look. She couldn't detect any flaws from him. She was surprised to find that Yan Feng, who was once a weak prince, was now so unfathomable. She nodded and said, \"Alright then, Bing Yun will take her leave.\" With that, she turned to leave.\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Yan Feng called out to Bing Yun. \"Miss Bing Yun, no matter why you are looking for Nian Bing, I hope you do not create any conflict with him. To me, Nian Bing is the most important brother. The fact that I am in this position now is thanks to him.\"\n\nBing Yun was shocked. She didn't expect Yan Feng to be willing to go against the Ice God Tower for Nian Bing. \"Alright, I understand.\"\n\nJust then, the eunuch entered again and respectfully said to Yan Feng, \"Your Majesty, Chief Court Mage Nian Bing requests an audience.\" Hearing this, Bing Yun, who was about to leave, immediately stopped.\n\nYan Feng thought, Nian Bing, Nian Bing, you've come at the worst possible time. He said helplessly, \"Please let him in.\"\n\nAs soon as Nian Bing entered, he saw Bing Yun, and Bing Yun was also looking at him. Their gazes met in mid-air, sparking a fiery collision. Nian Bing walked past Bing Yun and stood before Yan Feng, smiling, \"Nian Bing greets Your Majesty.\"\n\nYan Feng smiled. \"Stop this formality. Do brothers need to be like this?\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Yan Feng, who was much more confident than before, and felt a wave of relief. He was now the leader of the Blood Lion Sect, the biggest beneficiary of this change of power. However, Yan Feng had also benefited greatly; at least, he could finally hold his head high. Nian Bing smiled and said, \"I'm here today to bid you farewell.\"\n\nAlthough Yan Feng knew that Nian Bing was unlikely to stay in one place for long, he couldn't help but feel disappointed upon hearing Nian Bing's intention to leave. \"You have to leave so soon?\"\n\nNian Bing glanced at Bing Yun, who had moved to stand beside him, and said, \"Yes! I still have many things to do.\"\n\nYan Feng also looked at Bing Yun. \"Nian Bing, if you are willing to stay here, as long as I am here, anything is possible.\"\n\nNian Bing naturally understood what he was implying and shook his head. \"No need. I have my own matters to resolve myself. Your Majesty, take care. With Marshal Xue Po¹⁰ helping you, I believe you will be a qualified Emperor.\"\n\nYan Feng stood up from his seat, walked over to Nian Bing, and extended his hand to clasp his. \"No matter what, we are brothers. Without you, I wouldn't be where I am today. If you need help, just send a letter, and even if it means mobilizing the entire nation, I won't hesitate.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Yes! We are brothers. When I need your help, I will definitely ask. Treat Xue Yu¹¹ well. Compared to her, I am far inferior. She is the one who has always truly supported you.\" Although this event was very beneficial to Yan Feng, Nian Bing had, to some extent, used Yan Feng, so he felt a bit guilty.\n\nNian Bing left the palace, and Bing Yun followed him out. Yan Feng saw Nian Bing's confidence and did not stop them.\n\nAfter leaving the palace, Bing Yun suddenly quickened her pace and blocked Nian Bing's path. Nian Bing looked at her with a smile. \"What, Miss Bing Yun, do you need something from me?\"\n\nBing Yun looked at Nian Bing coldly. \"What you wanted to do, was it to help Yan Feng ascend the throne?\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled. \"I'm just an ordinary mage, how could I have such great ability to help him?\"\n\nBing Yun sneered, \"Before you came to Ice Moon City, Yan Feng was just a down-on-his-luck prince. But since you arrived, his destiny began to change. Judging from his attitude towards you, your involvement in him sitting on the throne is definitely significant. We carefully surveyed the scene. The First Prince, Yan Ji¹², is dead, but his subordinates probably weren't only those dozens of people. With those people, it's impossible to have broken into the palace and killed so many experts from the Royal Guard. And that enormous underground tunnel doesn't seem like something done by human hands.\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"Miss Bing Yun, overly intelligent girls are not likable.\"\n\nBing Yun said coldly, \"I have no interest in managing the affairs of the Ice Moon Empire, nor can I. However, your business should be finished. I think you should fulfill your promise.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, looking Bing Yun up and down. Bing Yun was still dressed as usual, but her sacred and noble aura seemed less cold than before. Recalling her extremely beautiful face behind the veil, a cold glint flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. \"Promise? Are you talking about my promise to go to the Ice God Tower? That's right, I did promise, but I never said when specifically I would go.\"\n\n---\n¹ Blood Lion Sect: A martial arts or religious organization.\n² Ice Moon Empire: A kingdom or nation.\n³ Hua Rong Empire: Another kingdom or nation.\n⁴ Ice Snow Goddess Stone: A magical artifact.\n⁵ Nourishing Dragon Claw Hand: A martial arts technique.\n⁶ Fire God Stone: Another magical artifact.\n⁷ Ice God Tower: An organization or building associated with ice magic.\n⁸ Marshal Xue Po: A military title or rank.\n⁹ Xue Yu: A person's name.\n¹⁰ Marshal Xue Po: Repeated, confirming it's a title.\n¹¹ Xue Yu: Repeated, confirming it's a person's name.\n¹² Yan Ji: A person's name.",

    "content": "Bing Yun said angrily, \"Do you want to go back on your word? It's too late even if you do. My master wants to see you.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"I know your master is in this Ice Moon City. I'm indeed not her match, and perhaps only a few people on the entire Yang Guang Continent can contend with her. However, don't forget, I possess the ability to use spatial magic. If I can't defeat her, can't I run? With my current cultivation, I can easily perform several medium-distance spatial transfers before your master finds me. As long as I don't use the Morning Dew Blade, no matter how strong your master's mental power is, she won't be able to sense my location.\"\n\n\"You...\" Looking at Nian Bing, who was almost annoyingly smiling before her, Bing Yun couldn't help but tremble with anger.\n\nSeeing Bing Yun's agitated state, Nian Bing felt a sense of glee. He smiled slightly and said, \"Miss Bing Yun, please don't be angry. I was just joking with you. How about this? I'll go out of the city to get something first, and when I return, I'll go see your master. What do you say?\"\n\nBing Yun was taken aback. \"Are you really going to see my master?\" A hint of loneliness crept into her icy voice.\n\nNian Bing calmly replied, \"What needs to be seen will be seen. Don't you want me to go?\"\n\n\"No, I... I didn't mean that. However, if you leave the city, will you really come back?\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled. \"So, in Miss Bing Yun's eyes, I'm just a petty person? In that case, how about Miss Bing Yun accompanying me to get that something? With you watching, you won't have to worry about me running away. I presume you and your master have some secret way of contacting each other, and within a certain range, she can be summoned to capture me at any time.\"\n\nBing Yun hesitated for a moment before saying, \"Alright, I'll go with you. When do we leave?\"\n\nNian Bing looked up at the clear sky. \"Let's go now.\" Without waiting for Bing Yun's reply, he recited a spell and, with the aid of the Wind Soaring Technique, took to the air. Bing Yun hurriedly activated her Blizzard to catch up with Nian Bing. The two, one after the other, soon exited Ice Snow City.\n\nFollowing behind Nian Bing, Bing Yun watched him calmly enveloped by the gentle breeze and couldn't help but ask, \"Aren't you worried at all? Master won't let you off.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled back. \"Since she won't let me off no matter what, what's the use of worrying?\"\n\nLooking at Nian Bing's deep gaze, Bing Yun felt a pang of unease. However, she did have a way to contact her master easily, so she didn't dwell on it. Nian Bing was like an abyss, an unfathomable abyss. He always held so many secrets; what kind of person was he?\n\nNian Bing maintained a steady speed as he flew forward. The Bing Yue Empire was mountainous, and soon they entered a mountain range. Nian Bing controlled his magic power and slowly descended. As winter was approaching, the biting mountain wind brought a chilling cold. However, as both of them cultivated ice magic, this bit of cold posed no threat to them.\n\nWhen Bing Yun followed Nian Bing down to the mountainside of a tall peak, her confusion grew. Did getting something require coming to this desolate mountain? As she pondered, Nian Bing waved his right hand, and seven-colored light flashed, with a brilliant green light shining brightly. Using the power of the wind, he pushed aside a large stone on the mountainside, revealing a dark cave entrance. Without calling Bing Yun, he walked into the cave.\n\nBing Yun followed Nian Bing into the cave in surprise. As they walked, she secretly prepared her innate domain, ready to react at any moment. Ever since she had been hit by Nian Bing's \"Grab-the-Nanny-Dragon-Claw-Hand,\" she had never trusted his character. Even she herself didn't understand what Nian Bing was to her. Judging by Nian Bing's kindness towards Mao Mao, he seemed very kind, but from his cold demeanor and despicable methods during the competition in the Hua Rong Empire, he seemed like a vulgar scoundrel. Yet, he possessed an incomparably handsome face and was skilled in cooking. Bing Yun always felt that she had never truly understood Nian Bing.\n\nAs they walked further in, Bing Yun suddenly felt a tremor throughout her body. A familiar sensation spread through her entire being, and a look of horror appeared in her eyes. The next moment, an intense feeling of weakness spread from her brain throughout her body. With a muffled groan, she managed to steady herself by leaning against the nearby wall.\n\nSeven-colored light appeared in time, enveloping Bing Yun's body. The viscous energy stabilized her delicate form. Nian Bing turned around, looking at her with a smile, but his eyes were filled with a chilling coldness.\n\n\"You, you're despicable! It's that Eternal Sleep again.\" Bing Yun understood what Nian Bing had done.\n\nNian Bing looked at Bing Yun, who was continuously channeling her magic power, preparing to explode, and said leisurely, \"That's right, it's the Eternal Sleep. I've already set up a trap in this cave. You don't need to try anything; it's useless. Without mental power, in my enhanced Heavenly Eye domain, your ice magic can't exert any power. Not long ago, I learned a mysterious spell from dark magic. Today, I'll use you for an experiment. It's the Nightmare Curse.\" As he spoke, Nian Bing lightly struck out with his palm. The light of the other six elements within the entire Heavenly Eye domain vanished, leaving only the dark aura.\n\nBing Yun felt her entire body tighten as if an invisible giant hand had grabbed her. An sinister aura continuously seeped into her pores, and her condensed ice magic power was rapidly dissipating like melting snow. No, it wasn't dissipating, but rather gradually losing its connection to her. Initially, Nian Bing's magic-sealing curse would not have worked on her, but without mental power, Bing Yun had lost her ability to resist. The dark aura continuously eroded her body. At this moment, in her eyes, Nian Bing looked like a devil, a devil from hell.\n\nNian Bing continuously uttered low incantations, placing seven layers of seals within Bing Yun's body. Without her mental power to control them, he forcibly suppressed all her magic power. Even in a direct confrontation, he was confident he could easily defeat Bing Yun. However, he couldn't take the risk. The Priestess of the Ice Snow Goddess was in Ice Moon City. Once she was drawn out, he would have no chance.\n\nNian Bing slowly walked up to Bing Yun and looked at her beautiful eyes filled with hatred. He smiled and said, \"Aren't you curious why I'm not affected by the Eternal Sleep? Actually, it's very simple. My domain has reached a new realm, and my mental power has solidified. Although the Eternal Sleep is peculiar, it can no longer affect me.\" He discovered this situation by chance. The Heavenly Eye acupoint had evolved to the mid-stage, and solidified mental power was no longer something that could be affected by magic arrays.\n\nWith a slight smile, a faint cold glint appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. He reached out and grabbed Bing Yun's shoulder, pulling her body deeper into the cave. At the same time, a black shadow separated from his body and, in the blink of an eye, moved outside the cave entrance, pushing the giant rock back into place to conceal the cave.\n\nDeep within the cave, Bing Yun saw a strange magic array on the ground. Nian Bing waved his left hand, and six beams of light appeared out of thin air, piercing the ground and illuminating the dark cave. The six divine blades, excluding the Demon Devourer, flickered with a faint glow, casting a bizarre and colorful scene in the deepest part of the dark cave.\n\nNian Bing placed the powerless Bing Yun on the ground and leaned against the wall behind her, looking at her. \"Now, we can have a good talk.\"\n\nThe white veil on Bing Yun's face had fallen off. Due to extreme anger, her originally icy face turned flushed red. \"There's nothing to talk about. My master won't let you off.\"\n\nNian Bing calmly said, \"Really? Try it. Your connection with your master also relies on magic. Not to mention that you can't use a trace of magic power now, even if you could, you wouldn't be able to contact her. I just excavated this cave not long ago. Outside the cave, I've set up six interference magic arrays. Without my permission, no magic aura can be transmitted out of the cave. Your master can no longer save you. If you still don't want to die, then cooperate with me properly.\" As he spoke, he deactivated the Eternal Sleep on the ground. With her magic power sealed, Bing Yun could no longer pose any threat to him. He didn't want Bing Yun to fall unconscious due to the loss of mental power.\n\n\"You're dreaming,\" Bing Yun shouted angrily. \"Kill me, go ahead and kill me. Do people from the Ice God Tower fear death?\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Bing Yun, who was struggling to stand up, and said coldly, \"You don't fear death? Alright, I'd like to see if you truly don't fear it or just pretend.\" He took a step forward and his right hand lightning-fastly grabbed Bing Yun's throat. With his dragon body's strength, he could easily kill Bing Yun if he wished.\n\nAs Nian Bing's large hand tightened, Bing Yun's face turned paler and paler. She didn't even struggle, and her gradually dimming eyes were filled with disdain. The two remained in a stalemate. Nian Bing could even feel Bing Yun's life force gradually draining. Bing Yun's skin was very delicate, as if she didn't even have pores. Beneath her smooth skin, the blood flow slowed down with the tightening of Nian Bing's hand, yet she still showed no sign of compromise. Looking at her stubborn gaze, Nian Bing's heart inexplicably softened. He released his hand, allowing Bing Yun to collapse onto the ground, gasping for breath.\n\nNian Bing squatted down and said, \"As long as you're willing to answer a few questions, I won't harm you. Mao Mao said you're a good person, and I believe her. The things I want to ask you won't threaten your Ice God Tower. As a child, I just want to know the real situation of my parents. If they are truly not dead as you said, then I want to know their exact location within the Ice God Tower. As long as you tell me, I'll let you leave immediately.\"\n\nA resentful gleam appeared in Bing Yun's eyes. \"Don't dream. You'll never get anything about the Ice God Tower from me. Kill me, go ahead and kill me, you despicable scoundrel, who only uses underhanded tactics.\"\n\n\"Despicable?\" Nian Bing laughed, his voice filled with grief and indignation. \"This is all because your master forced me! If not for her, why would my parents have left me? Since I was young, I never had a childhood. When my father was still alive, we lived in constant fear every day. Later, both my father and mother were harmed by your master, that old demon. My current situation is entirely forced upon me by that old demon. For my parents, I'm willing to do anything, no matter how despicable. My patience is limited. I'll ask you one last time, will you speak or not?\"\n\nBing Yun disdainfully said, \"Are you threatening me? I'm not even afraid of death, so what grounds do you have to threaten me?\"\n\nA black aura suddenly appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. He stared at Bing Yun. \"Look into my eyes.\" Bing Yun instinctively looked up at him. She saw the black luster flashing in Nian Bing's eyes, and a layer of black mist flickered in her eyes. With each flicker, she clearly felt her consciousness becoming more hazy.\n\n\"Look into my eyes, I am the person you trust most. Look into my eyes, and you will believe everything I say.\" Nian Bing's voice was exceptionally low, and his magnetic voice seemed like a call from a nightmare, gradually mesmerizing Bing Yun.\n\nAt this moment, a cold aura rose from Bing Yun's mind. Her consciousness, which was about to be mesmerized, instantly became clear due to the stimulation, and her hazy eyes returned to clarity. \"What are you doing?\"\n\nNian Bing grunted, his body swayed, and he almost fell to the ground. At this moment, his heart was filled with surprise. He was using the hypnosis spell from dark magic. When the Second Elder of the Blood Lion Hall taught him this spell, he had told him that as long as his mental power was higher than his opponent's, he could hypnotize the opponent and obtain anything he wanted. However, this spell failed on Bing Yun. Under the guidance of her mental power, his spirit suffered a significant tremor. Fortunately, he had the Heavenly Eye acupoint to solidify his mental power, which prevented him from suffering real harm. Even so, it forced Nian Bing to re-evaluate Bing Yun.\n\n\"Your bizarre methods are completely ineffective. I told you, even if you kill me, you won't get anything from me.\" Bing Yun looked at Nian Bing coldly and said disdainfully.\n\nNian Bing said hatefully, \"Do you really think I have no way with you? Miss Bing Yun, I just want to know the whereabouts of my parents.\"\n\nBing Yun looked at Nian Bing coldly. \"Senior Sister Bing Ling violated the rules of the Ice God Tower by getting together with an outsider and giving birth to you. She committed a grave sin. No matter what their outcome, they brought it upon themselves.\"\n\nNian Bing's expression changed. \"How dare you comment on my parents' affairs? Have you ever truly loved someone? If you've never loved someone, how can you know what it's like to be in love? Why do you presume to judge my parents? You're not worthy.\"\n\n\"Not worthy? Hmph, I will say it. What are you going to do about it? If you have the ability, kill me. Your parents brought it upon themselves.\" Bing Yun seemed a bit frantic in her anger.",

    "content": "Nian Bing's face contorted. \"Miss Bingyun, you seem to have forgotten one thing. You are female, and I am male. I don't necessarily need to threaten you with death to deal with you. I heard that the women who come from your Ice God Tower are all very haughty. Fine! I want to see just how haughty you are.\" Amidst Bingyun's startled cry, he pounced forward, pressing his body onto Bingyun. He cupped her delicate face and, with hatred, kissed her deeply.\n\nBingyun's entire body trembled violently. The fear that hadn't appeared even when facing death now filled her clear, cold eyes. She struggled desperately, but with her weakened body, which hadn't recovered its mental strength, how could she resist Nian Bing's dragon-like physique?\n\nBingyun's lips were tightly shut. Nian Bing's heart, burning with hatred, became frenzied. He used his tongue to forcibly pry open Bingyun's cold lips, his body radiating a fiery aura as he probed into her small mouth.\n\nBingyun's heart became exceptionally flustered. She had never been so close to, so intimate with, a man. In her panic, she bit down hard on Nian Bing's tongue, but Nian Bing's modified body was exceptionally resilient. All her efforts were in vain. Nian Bing found Bingyun's cool, trembling little tongue and sucked it madly. Simultaneously, his large hand had already slipped inside Bingyun's robes, grasping her cool, soft, yet elastic, high breasts.\n\nThis was the second time, but the feeling was completely different. The fiery sensation, coupled with wildness, made Nian Bing lose his sanity. The more Bingyun struggled beneath him, the more her struggles intensely stimulated Nian Bing, making him more excited. Bingyun's clothes were shed one by one, turning into wisps under Nian Bing's magically imbued hands. Her fair skin flushed a faint crimson under his heated palm. Bingyun's perfect, goddess-like body was infinitely tempting to Nian Bing. Hatred, rage, and a complex mix of emotions had made him lose all reason.\n\nAt this moment, Bingyun's body became even more powerless. Nian Bing's fervor seemed to melt her icy demeanor. The strange sensation gradually made her lose herself, and her resistance grew weaker, only able to feebly beat Nian Bing's back.\n\nNian Bing released Bingyun's slightly swollen lips and kissed her exquisitely tender face. The warmth of her skin sent shivers through Bingyun's body. Nian Bing's lips moved to her neck, leaving behind rose-red marks.\n\nLowering his head, Nian Bing held a budding nipple between his lips. In the midst of their physical contact, his right hand subconsciously slipped between Bingyun's legs into her sacred maidenhood. The moist sensation seemed to tell him that everything was ready. Nian Bing's fiery heart felt as if it had found an outlet, and his assault on Bingyun became even more intense. He had no experience, and his movements were exceptionally crude, leaving marks on Bingyun's fair skin. Bingyun had completely lost her ability to resist. She clearly felt Nian Bing's burning body adjusting its position, but she was utterly powerless to resist.\n\nJust as the sword was about to meet its sheath, a lazy voice echoed in Nian Bing's mind, \"Boss, you're not that much of a beast, are you?\"\n\nNian Bing's body froze. Oscar's voice sounded again, \"Boss, I just hope you don't do something you'll regret. If you want to continue, I won't stop you. It's up to you.\"\n\nNian Bing's bloodshot eyes gradually regained clarity. His right hand flashed with a blue light, and he suddenly pressed a piece of ice and snow condensed by himself onto his face. Under the cold stimulation, he finally sobered up, stumbled away from Bingyun's body, and fell to the side, panting heavily. The only sounds in the entire cave were Nian Bing's heavy breaths and Bingyun's gasping sobs.\n\nSilence lasted for a long time. Nian Bing continuously circulated the ice magic power within his body through every meridian, gradually expelling the intense heat and calming his mind. He didn't blame Oscar for ruining his pleasure. Instead, he secretly thanked him in his heart. What was happening to him? If he had truly raped Bingyun, how would he be different from a beast? How could he face Feng Nü and Long Ling, who loved him deeply?\n\nHe raised his head and looked at Bingyun. Bingyun remained in her previous posture, her fair skin flushed with a rosy glow. Her gasps had become fainter. Nian Bing clearly saw faint bruises on her alluring body, especially the dense kiss marks on her long, swan-like neck. Were these all his doing?\n\nBingyun's body was too tempting. Looking at her, Nian Bing's suppressed lust stirred again. Startled, he quickly retrieved a piece of clothing from his spatial ring and threw it beside Bingyun. \"Put this on first,\" he said, only to realize his voice was hoarse.\n\nBingyun pulled the clothes over herself and also looked up. Her exceptionally beautiful face no longer held any trace of coldness. With teary eyes, she looked at Nian Bing. The deep hatred in her gaze made Nian Bing's heart tremble. With his powerful mental strength, he dared to meet Bingyun's gaze. He lowered his head and said, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nBingyun remained silent. She would have felt better if she had cursed Nian Bing now, but she didn't. The malice in her eyes gradually disappeared, and her originally charming large eyes were filled with lifelessness. Her hands tightly gripped the golden magic robe Nian Bing had thrown to her, her knuckles appearing stark white from the excessive force.\n\nNian Bing stood up, tidied his clothes, and left the cave as if fleeing. He dared not stay there any longer, fearing he would see Bingyun's lifeless eyes and be filled with intense regret. Originally, he hated everyone in the Ice God Tower. However, since interacting with Bingyun, he realized that beneath her icy exterior, Bingyun possessed a kind heart. This was easily discernible from her attitude towards Mao Mao. Although she had always been very wary of him, she hadn't used any means to deal with him. In Ice Moon City, she hadn't even sent people from the Ice God Tower to capture him, merely waiting. But what had he done? He had hurt a girl like this. She was so pure, but what about him?\n\nWith a sense of vexation, Nian Bing soared into the air. Under the influence of the wind element, he plunged into the mountains.\n\nWhen Nian Bing returned to the cave, Bingyun was still in the same position, her movements unchanged. The lifelessness in her eyes had turned into dullness, as if she hadn't noticed Nian Bing's return.\n\nNian Bing spread the bear hide he carried on his back onto the ground and said softly, \"Bingyun, rest on the bear hide. I've cleaned it thoroughly and used magic to remove any gamey smell. The weather is getting a bit cold now.\"\n\nBingyun didn't move, remaining seated as she was, not even looking at Nian Bing. They remained in a stalemate, neither moving.\n\nWith a sigh, Nian Bing bent down. He put one arm around Bingyun and reached under her legs with the other to lift her from the ground. When his hand touched Bingyun's body, he could clearly feel her entire body tremble, but she didn't move or resist, allowing Nian Bing to place her body on the soft, thick bear hide. Nian Bing adjusted the magic robe on her, covering her exposed fair shoulders. At this point, Bingyun's own clothes were completely unwearable and were piled aside, making Nian Bing feel extremely awkward. Seeing Bingyun still unresponsive, he could only say to himself, \"I'll go get you something to eat.\"\n\nWith that, Nian Bing waved his right hand, and a ball of magical flame ignited beside Bingyun, not only brightening the cave but also bringing a bit of warmth. When he held Bingyun, he felt that her body was very cold, and her blood circulation seemed poor. Nian Bing put away his six divine blades into his spatial ring, glanced at Bingyun one last time, and then walked outside. Earlier, he had killed a black bear in the mountains that was preparing to hibernate. Bear paws were considered one of the eight treasures of the realm and were a rare delicacy. His previous impulsive actions towards Bingyun made Nian Bing very regretful, and he subconsciously felt he needed to compensate her for something.\n\nAlthough the thick bear hide wasn't exactly soft, it was at least more comfortable than the ground. With her magic power sealed by Nian Bing, Bingyun could also feel the genuine cold. The dullness in her eyes flickered, and she slowly put on the magic robe covering her, even pulling the hood over her head. Nian Bing's oversized magic robe instantly covered every inch of her skin. By this time, the Ice Moon Empire had entered early winter. Although they were deep in the cave, the biting mountain wind outside had already lowered the temperature of the mountain range below freezing. While Nian Bing was out hunting the black bear, Bingyun's body had become stiff with cold. Now, with the help of the bear hide and the magical flame, she gradually warmed up. The greatest advantage of magical flames was that they produced no smoke.\n\nIn a short while, a rich aroma filled every corner of the cave. It was a sweet aroma, full of alluring flavor. Bingyun curled up on the bear hide, her expression still dull, but the pale color of her face, due to the cold, had gained a hint of color, as if she hadn't smelled the aroma.\n\nNian Bing's footsteps sounded. He always carried his cooking utensils with him. Whenever he arrived at a large city, he would replenish his supplies of various seasonings, making cooking quite easy. He approached Bingyun, holding a large plate, and squatted down. He opened the lid of the plate, and immediately, an unparalleled rich aroma wafted out. There were no extra decorations on the plate, only two enormous bear paws. The bear paws were golden in color, with juices flowing on the surface. The rich aroma with a slightly sweet scent continuously stimulated Nian Bing's and Bingyun's senses of smell.\n\nSeeing that Bingyun still had no reaction, a faint smile appeared on Nian Bing's face. \"The Ice Moon Empire is located in the far north, and the animals here are known for their dense, thick fur, tender, fatty meat. This ice bear is an excellent ingredient, difficult to find. It was about to enter hibernation, storing a large amount of energy, most of which was concentrated in its four paws. I used a honey-preserving method, placing honeycomb on the bear paws and steaming them over a low heat. Just as the bear paws were nearing doneness, I injected ice elements into them and steamed them again, for a total of three times. This fully stimulated the nutrients hidden within the bear paws and their wild flavor. Mixed with the sweetness of honey, no other seasonings are needed. As long as it's eaten while hot, it nourishes the skin and complexion, and is most suitable in this cold environment. Miss Bingyun, wouldn't you like to taste this heavenly delicacy?\"\n\nBingyun slowly raised her head and glared at Nian Bing with resentment, still silent. Seeing her resentful gaze, Nian Bing felt a little better. At least, this was better than the lifelessness from before.\n\nNian Bing flicked his wrist, took out the cloth bag containing his ghost carving knives, and drew out the largest one. The ghost carving knife danced in his fingers, and he immediately sliced off a piece of succulent, thick bear paw meat, offering it to Bingyun. \"Come, have some. The things I make are definitely delicious. Don't you want to taste them?\"\n\nBingyun continued to glare at Nian Bing hatefully, but she didn't move at all. Nian Bing's brow furrowed slightly. \"Looking at you, you probably wish you could skin me alive, tear out my tendons, and chop my body into ten thousand pieces to vent your anger. But if you starve to death, how will you get revenge on me? If you want to kill me, you need to conserve your strength so you'll have a chance.\"\n\n\"Go to hell.\" Bingyun's voice was like that from hell. The extremely cold feeling made even Nian Bing's heart turn cold.\n\nNian Bing showed a wry smile. \"At least I don't have ill intentions towards you now. I was wrong before, but you have to understand that you insulted my parents first, which is why I became so impulsive. You're not eating? Do you want me to feed you with my mouth? Don't worry, I won't let you die. If you insist on not eating, I can only feed you myself. You should understand that you have no power to resist me now.\"\n\nA blush appeared on Bingyun's face. Her eyes, filled with hatred, now held a trace of panic. She subconsciously opened her still slightly swollen little mouth. Nian Bing smiled slightly, blew on the steaming bear paw, and then put it into Bingyun's mouth, watching her eat the nourishing delicacy.\n\nThe tender, smooth bear paw meat was filled with a sweet aroma. When Bingyun ate the first bite of bear paw, the hatred in her eyes momentarily disappeared. Such delicious food is tempting to anyone. Warmth rose from within her, and she immediately felt much more comfortable. At this moment, Nian Bing had already brought another piece of bear paw to her mouth. Bingyun wanted to take the ghost carving knife and eat it herself, but her mental strength had not recovered at all, coupled with the intense stimulation from before, her entire body felt weak and limp. Let alone moving her hands, she didn't even have the strength to sit up. She could only let Nian Bing feed the bear paw into her mouth.\n\nSeeing Bingyun eat the food he made, Nian Bing breathed a sigh of relief, and his guilt was alleviated. He carefully helped Bingyun to sit up, letting her lean on his shoulder. Bingyun wanted to struggle, but she lacked the strength. Piece after piece of bear paw was sent to her mouth, and the sweet, rich delicacy made her forget to resist.",

    "title": "Chapter 157 The Real Situation of Parents (Part 1)",
    "content": "Watching Bingyun’s vibrant red lips part and close, and feeling the smooth skin beneath her magic robe, Nianbing’s heart couldn’t help but stir. He had even forgotten his plan to interrogate Bingyun. In this warm atmosphere, he continued to feed the bear’s paw into Bingyun’s mouth. Watching her eat the delicious food he made, he gradually felt a sense of satisfaction. He shifted the shoulder she was leaning on, raising his arm to embrace her delicate body, making her sit more comfortably. In a short while, an entire bear’s paw had gone into Bingyun’s belly. Nianbing felt it was enough, and only then did he stop feeding her.\n\nBingyun glanced somewhat regretfully at the other bear’s paw, but she quickly realized her relationship with Nianbing. Under the energy from the bear’s paw, her stamina had recovered somewhat. She struggled hard. Nianbing wiped Bingyun’s mouth with his sleeve and helped her lie back down on the bearskin. He then started a fire beside her and devoured the other bear’s paw with gusto. While eating, he stole glances at Bingyun. Bingyun’s gaze had returned to a dazed state; she didn't even look at him, just lay there on the bearskin. Nianbing realized he seemed reluctant to let go of the feeling of holding her earlier.\n\nAfter finishing the bear’s paw, Nianbing tidied everything up. This one ice bear was enough for the two of them to eat for a month. Sealed with ice magic, there was no fear of it spoiling. When he had tidied everything and returned to the inner cave, Bingyun had already closed her eyes, but there was no snoring.\n\nNianbing sat down not far from her. Bingyun had wrapped herself up very tightly, and he could only see her alluring curves from outside her magic robe. Recalling how he had violated Bingyun, his heart couldn’t help but stir. He said, \"Bingyun, I know you’re not asleep. How about this, we talk? Please believe me, I really didn’t mean to hurt you. I just want to know the whereabouts of my parents.\"\n\nBingyun suddenly opened her eyes. Nianbing saw those eyes filled with resentment again. \"You didn't mean to hurt me? Even if you killed me, I wouldn't hate you as much as I do now.\"\n\nNianbing was somewhat stunned and said, \"This, this, I really couldn't control myself at the time. However, I fought with myself for a long time before I could stop myself at the last moment. Fortunately, I didn't ruin your chastity. I know you hate me, but there's no need to be so hard on yourself! Perhaps your master is looking for you now, but as I said, she can't possibly find me here.\"\n\nBingyun stared at Nianbing as well. \"Since I was little, no man has touched me except my father. You've insulted me like this twice now, and you still say you haven't ruined my chastity.\"\n\nNianbing said with a wry smile, \"It's already done. What do you want? Should I let you touch me back?\"\n\n\"You...\" Bingyun trembled with anger. \"You're despicable, shameless, and vulgar. If you don't kill me now, one day I will make your life worse than death.\"\n\nSeeing Bingyun's furious expression, a smile flickered across Nianbing's face. \"Alright, I'll wait for that day. It seems you won't tell me the whereabouts of my parents no matter what I say. Fine, I won't force you. Rest assured, I will never violate you again. We'll just stay here until one of us gives in. I have plenty of time. Apart from not being able to leave here, I will definitely take good care of your daily life. We'll live here for a while. Whenever you feel annoyed, just tell me what I want to know, and I'll let you go immediately. As for how you want to get revenge, I'll be waiting.\"\n\n\"Who wants to live here with you?\" Bingyun, with strength she didn't know she had, suddenly sat up from the bearskin. She glared hatefully at Nianbing beside her and swung her hand to slap his face. *Slap.* A clear handprint appeared on Nianbing’s handsome face. After hitting him, Bingyun herself was stunned and subconsciously said, \"Why didn't you dodge?\" Nianbing sighed softly and said, \"It was wrong of me to offend you earlier, and it's only right that I take a slap from you. If you're still angry, hit me a couple more times.\"\n\nBingyun raised her hand again, but her hand didn't fall. \"Hmph, you wish. I won't hit you; I'll make you suffer from your own conscience.\"\n\nNianbing chuckled. \"Is that what you think? You also said I'm a despicable, shameless, and vulgar scoundrel. Would a scoundrel feel ashamed of what he's done? You think too highly of me. However, to be honest, Miss Bingyun, you have a really good figure.\"\n\n\"You...\" Bingyun’s raised hand finally swung down again, but this time Nianbing caught her wrist. \"You didn't hit me just now, but I won't let you off now.\" Nianbing placed Bingyun back on the bearskin and wrapped her delicate body with it. Bingyun tried to struggle, but Nianbing said, \"You'd better stay as you are and don't move. I'm a normal man. You're only wearing my magic robe, and you're completely bare underneath. If I get 'beastly' again (hoho, beast fans will curse! Typed by hand), I can't guarantee I'll stop myself at the last moment.\"\n\nUpon hearing Nianbing's words, Bingyun immediately stopped struggling. While glaring fiercely at him, she tightened the bearskin around herself, only her head sticking out. \"Nianbing, you be careful. Maybe I'll throw a blade into your cooking pot when you're cooking and make you have a ruptured intestine.\" Nianbing chuckled. \"I know very well what you have on you. You can't use magic now, so where will you find a blade? Besides, even if I really ate a blade, I probably wouldn't die.\"\n\nBingyun simply closed her eyes. She knew she couldn't win an argument with Nianbing, and would only make herself angry. Closing her eyes, she constantly gathered her lost mental power, searching for a way to connect with her magic. Only by regaining her strength could she possibly escape from here. Seeing that Bingyun was no longer paying attention to him, Nianbing turned and walked away. What he had said to Bingyun wasn't a lie; if he looked at her alluring body a few more times, Nianbing might really lose control.\n\nAs soon as Nianbing walked out of the inner cave, Bingyun’s eyes sprang open. She quickly took out a small, white jade tube about three inches long from her hair and brought it to her lips, blowing it softly. No sound came out, but the small tube exuded a lustrous sheen. The hatred in Bingyun's eyes intensified. She seemed to already see Nianbing dying before her.\n\nNianbing and Bingyun continued to stall. Apart from limiting Bingyun’s magic and freedom, Nianbing took exceptionally good care of her. Every day, he cooked various delicious foods for her, changing the dishes. The inner cave was already covered with animal furs, and with the constant burning of magic flames, Bingyun never felt cold. Nianbing knew she liked cleanliness, so he even used wind magic to carve a pit half a zhang deep in the cave and then used ice and fire magic to create hot water for her to bathe. From that day on, Bingyun rarely spoke to Nianbing. She ate the food when it was prepared and bathed when the hot water was ready. Nianbing did not live with her in the inner cave; he cultivated at the entrance of the cave. Every day, he would ask Bingyun about his parents once. Bingyun ignored him. Both were waiting, just for different things. Ten days passed quickly. Whenever Nianbing cooked, Bingyun would proactively stay by his side. When Nianbing wasn't paying attention, she would throw things like rocks into the pot. Unfortunately, Nianbing detected it every time. Nianbing didn't blame her; he just remade the dish and still let her eat to her satisfaction. Eating exquisite food every day, compared to when she first arrived, Bingyun's fair skin became more radiant, and her originally weak body appeared plumper, making her look even more captivating.\n\n\"Bingyun, I'm back.\" Nianbing's voice came from outside. Bingyun, who was meditating cross-legged, opened her eyes and watched Nianbing's tall figure appear at the cave entrance. She had tried the dark magic's suppression curse countless times. Every time she broke through a level of restraint, Nianbing would immediately detect it and reapply the restraint within her body.\n\nNianbing placed the things in his hands aside and smiled, \"Look, I found this in a valley not far from here. It's a small basin, and the temperature is much higher than here. There are even plants growing. Do you recognize these fruits? Can they be eaten?\" He pointed to the items he had brought back. Bingyun glanced at them and saw that they were purple fruits, about the size of longans, emitting a faint fragrance. They were crystal clear, like gemstones. She shook her head and said, \"This is the first time I've seen these fruits. Let's just eat them. At worst, we'll die together.\" Her voice was no longer as cold. Although she still harbored animosity towards Nianbing, she had gradually adapted to this life. Nianbing had misjudged one thing: Bingyun did not fear loneliness. When she was cultivating in the Ice God Palace, it was much lonelier than here. She only ate a little dry food every day. How could it compare to the pleasure of tasting the top-notch cuisine Nianbing made? Moreover, although she hated Nianbing, having Nianbing talk to her every day meant she didn't feel lonely at all. Apart from losing her freedom and the inability to control her magic, life here was actually more comfortable than in the Ice God Palace. Furthermore, Nianbing hadn't touched her even once since that day. Although hatred still lingered in her heart, it wasn't as intense.\n\nNianbing smiled and said, \"Forget it, then let's not eat them. I'm not willing to die. Bingyun, even if you don't tell me about things in the Ice God Palace, can you tell me if my parents are really not dead?\"\n\nLooking at Nianbing's hopeful eyes, Bingyun's heart softened. She didn't speak, but lightly nodded. Nianbing was overjoyed. \"Really? That's great! They're not dead, they're actually not dead!\" He jumped up excitedly, forgetting that the cave was only two meters high when it was carved. *Bang!* His head immediately hit the ceiling. Although his body was very strong, he still hit his head until he was dizzy, exclaimed, and fell to the ground, holding his head and crying out in pain.\n\nA silver bell-like laugh rang out. Looking at Nianbing's disheveled state, Bingyun burst into genuine laughter. Nianbing looked up at her. The smiling Bingyun was incredibly beautiful, breathtakingly so. His eyes were completely dazed. \"Bingyun, you're so beautiful when you smile. Why do you always wear a poker face?\"\n\nBingyun froze for a moment, her smile retracted. She snorted and said, \"Of course, I'm happy when you're in trouble. Why should I smile for you?\" Nianbing smiled slightly and sat up. \"Okay, then don't smile. But, regardless, thank you for telling me about my parents. Tomorrow, we'll add some dishes; I'll cook a few more dishes for you as thanks.\" Saying this, he turned and walked outside.\n\nWatching Nianbing's receding figure, Bingyun's gaze gradually turned cold. She turned to the purple fruits on the ground. Were they really poison? Her master had once said that poisonous things often had vibrant colors. These fruits looked so beautiful; they were very likely highly poisonous. But, should she kill him? Bingyun's heart was in intense turmoil. The kindness Nianbing had shown her over the past ten days kept flashing through her mind, but the memory of him almost raping her also made her unable to quell her fear. Should she just let it go? Did she no longer hate him? No, that was absolutely impossible. But why, when she didn't see him every day, would she feel a sense of longing? No, it was impossible. How could she have fallen for this despicable fellow? Her mind was in chaos. Suddenly, she snatched the fruits Nianbing had brought back. Holding them in her hand, she muttered to herself, \"Master, Yun'er's body is already impure. Yun'er's heart is also in turmoil and is no longer pure. Master! Yun'er is sorry for your teachings. If this is truly poison, then let me die with that scoundrel. I cannot forgive him, but if this continues, perhaps, perhaps I will truly no longer hate him. Let heaven decide everything. I hope this will be an end.\" Thinking this, she resolutely stood up and walked outside.\n\nIn Nianbing's hands, various rays of light kept transforming. The prepared food ingredients were gradually turning into exquisite delicacies under the effect of his magic. Upon receiving the news that his parents were not dead, Nianbing was indescribably excited. His cooking today was even more vigorous than usual. When Bingyun walked out, he had already prepared two simple yet complex dishes.\n\n\"Bingyun, you've come at the right time. Help me watch the soup pot and stir it with this spoon. I'm going out to get some frozen meat. We'll have something to eat soon.\" Saying this, he turned and walked towards the outside of the cave.\n\nHolding the spoon that still retained Nianbing's body temperature, Bingyun's gaze was somewhat dazed. Nianbing's handsome face was full of sunny vitality with his excitement. Looking at the steaming soup pot, her heart suddenly ached fiercely. However, she still unhesitatingly threw the purple fruits into the soup. At the same time, she also popped some of the fruits into her own mouth.",

    "content": "He crushed the fruit with a ladle, blending it into the soup. Come what may, no matter his place in her heart, she would die with him. Her resolve to die made Bing Yun feel a sense of release. She slowly stirred the ladle, a trace of tragic beauty in her eyes.\n\nA moment later, Nian Bing returned. His excitement prevented him from noticing anything amiss with Bing Yun. He took the spoon, and a magical light flashed again as he continued his cooking.\n\nBing Yun leaned against the wall, her captivating gaze fixed on Nian Bing's fluid movements. Her heart was completely at ease at this moment. She realized how handsome Nian Bing looked when he was focused. Her gaze grew distant; she no longer wanted to dwell on hatred or anything else. At this moment, all she saw was Nian Bing's tall, straight figure.\n\nTime passed quickly and unnoticed. Nian Bing completed his final action and said with a smile, \"Alright, all done. Four dishes and one soup, not bad, right? Come, Bing Yun, we can start eating.\"\n\nWhen Nian Bing turned to look at Bing Yun, who had been standing there the whole time, he was surprised to see that the proud plum blossom amidst the ice and snow was smiling at him. Her stunningly beautiful face was like a spring breeze thawing the ice, with no trace of coldness. Even in her captivating eyes, there was no sign of hatred. \"Nian Bing, can we eat inside today? It's a bit cold out here.\"\n\nNian Bing was taken aback. Ever since he had fed Bing Yun bear paw that day, they had always eaten outside, and Bing Yun would return to the inner cave after eating. This was the first time she had voluntarily asked to eat in the inner cave. It was also the first time she had called him by his name since arriving here. Bing Yun's gentleness made Nian Bing somewhat unaccustomed to it. He tentatively asked, \"Bing Yun, are you alright?\"\n\nBing Yun smiled faintly. \"Didn't you say I was beautiful when I smiled? Let's go, we'll eat in the cave.\" As she spoke, she proactively picked up two plates of food and walked towards the cave.\n\nAlthough Nian Bing was somewhat bewildered, this was a positive change for Bing Yun. He rejoiced inwardly, thinking that perhaps he could elicit some information from her today. He quickly followed with the remaining food.\n\n\"Is it good?\" Nian Bing asked Bing Yun as they sat on the beast hides and ate. He noticed that Bing Yun seemed very happy today, with a faint smile constantly on her exquisitely beautiful face. Having a beautiful woman dining with him, and this beautiful woman seeming to smile because of him, felt wonderful.\n\nBing Yun nodded. \"Nian Bing, do you know? The first time I ate your roast meat, I realized that food could be so delicious. I normally have a small appetite, but after eating your food, my appetite increased significantly. Your food is much more delicious than anything I've eaten before. Eating this is a pleasure in itself.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"It is my honor to receive Miss Bing Yun's praise. This is the first time you've praised my cooking, though I've always thought so myself.\"\n\nBing Yun smiled. \"You're getting arrogant after just one compliment. Can't you be more humble? Eat some of this; I think this is the most delicious.\" As she spoke, she surprisingly picked up a dish from in front of her and placed it in Nian Bing's bowl.\n\nNian Bing was stunned. He put down his chopsticks and reached out to touch Bing Yun's forehead. Bing Yun trembled and quickly dodged backward. \"What are you doing?\"\n\nNian Bing asked doubtfully, \"Bing Yun, you're acting very strange today! I wanted to see if you had a fever.\"\n\nBing Yun's pretty face flushed. \"You're the one with the fever! Do you want me to treat you like I did before?\"\n\n\"No, no, of course not.\" Nian Bing waved his hands repeatedly. \"You're acting like a real woman now, Bing Yun, you're truly beautiful. I know you've always been suspicious of me, but I'm not as useless as you think. Would you like to hear my story?\"\n\nBing Yun nodded, served two bowls of hot soup, handed one to Nian Bing, and held the other herself. \"You tell me.\"\n\nFeeling Bing Yun's tenderness and thinking of his yet-unfound parents, Nian Bing felt a warmth in his heart. He then began to recount his experiences from childhood to Bing Yun. He was completely immersed in his memories. As he spoke and drank the hot soup, he didn't notice Bing Yun's strange gaze. Seeing him drink the soup, Bing Yun drank hers as well.\n\n\"What? You helped Yan Feng ascend to the throne just for a woman?\" Bing Yun looked at Nian Bing in surprise.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"Is there anything wrong with that? Ling'er sacrificed so much for me, always waiting for me silently. How could I let her suffer any more harm? It's fine now. When you tell me where my parents are, I'll go find Ling'er first, and then I'll figure out how to infiltrate your Ice God Tower to rescue my parents. I don't have any great ambitions in my life; I just hope to live a peaceful life with my parents and the woman I love. Another wish is to win the championship of the Cooking God Competition; this is my master's dying wish and must be fulfilled. Now that I think about it, wouldn't it be a warm scene if my father, mother, and my beloved women could eat my cooking every day!\"\n\nLooking at the longing in his eyes, Bing Yun's nose inexplicably felt a sting. She suddenly realized she regretted putting the fruit into the soup. She deeply felt that Nian Bing was such a person of deep emotions, and everything he did was for family affection! How could she still hate such a person? But, it was too late to say anything now. Lowering her head, Bing Yun said dejectedly, \"I'm sorry. I misjudged you. Nian Bing, do you want to know about your parents? I'll tell you.\"\n\nNian Bing awoke from his reverie, his body trembling with excitement. \"You, are you telling the truth? Are you really willing to tell me?\"\n\nBing Yun nodded gently. \"Yes, I am willing to tell you.\" For a dying person, secrets no longer held any meaning. She had already eaten the purple fruit, and a cramping pain had begun in her lower abdomen. She knew very well that with her constitution, ordinary toxins would have no effect. The purple fruit must be a potent poison. Since she was going to die anyway, all she could do was fulfill Nian Bing's last wish. Taking a deep breath, she suppressed the pain within her, showing no signs of discomfort, and said in a low voice, \"Actually, my master was originally a kind elder. Although she was a bit arrogant due to her strength, she was inherently very kind. Bing Ling, senior sister, who is your mother, was master's most beloved disciple. Master was pure and chaste her entire life. She always regarded Bing Ling as her own daughter, pouring almost all her effort into her. However, master never expected that Bing Ling would betray her for a man and elope with him. That man was your father, Rong Tian of the Rong family.\"\n\nNian Bing said indignantly, \"What do you mean betrayal? The rule of your Ice God Tower that prohibits disciples from marrying outsiders is against heavenly principles. Is love wrong?\"\n\nBing Yun sighed. \"You don't understand. Master once said that to become a true powerhouse, one must make sacrifices. Before each disciple joins the Ice God Tower, master would ask for their consent. Only when they sincerely agree to the rules of the Ice God Tower can they officially become disciples; there is no coercion. Since they chose to join the Ice God Tower, how can they betray it? Violating the rules of the Ice God Tower must be punished. Master was not wrong, and perhaps Bing Ling was not wrong either.\" At this moment, she suddenly understood why Bing Ling had rebelled against the Ice God Tower. The cramping in her abdomen intensified, but Bing Yun's heart became clearer. She deeply felt the taste of love.\n\nNian Bing pressed, \"Get to the point. I don't want to hear you make excuses for your master. I just want to know how my parents are doing now.\"\n\nBing Yun nodded. \"After Bing Ling, senior sister, was brought back to the Ice God Tower by master, master intended to punish her severely. However, years of affection are not so easily discarded. Not only did master not punish senior sister severely, but she also imparted all her understanding of magic, hoping senior sister would realize her mistake. But senior sister was too deeply infatuated. She even abandoned her cultivation, and every day she would silently chant two names: yours and your father's. I heard these things from Aunt Bing Leng because I was very young then. Later, when master was about to pass on her legacy to senior sister, your father brought you to the Ice God Tower to cause trouble. The moment senior sister saw your father, she seemed to forget everything and voluntarily gave up inheriting master's legacy, wanting to escape with your father. It was only then that master completely lost hope in senior sister. In her fury, she struck with great force. You were lucky; you escaped using a spatial magic scroll. Later, Senior Brother Bing Lu, who was responsible for chasing you, returned and said you had fallen into the river and died. From that day on, master's emotions became very strange for a long time. She would fly into a rage over the slightest thing. Only when I grew up did I understand that master was grieving. Bing Ling senior sister's betrayal was a huge blow to her. However, senior sister and your father were indeed not dead. Although master hated them immensely, she couldn't bring herself to be harsh with the sister she treated as a daughter. Thus, she used her powerful ice magic to seal them in the Ice God Tower's Icy Hell. It was an ice prison, sealed with powerful magic by master, where they would receive food daily from a designated person. This lasted for nearly ten years. I secretly went to see them once. Bing Ling senior sister and your father seemed unfazed by their imprisonment; they were simply cultivating quietly, enduring the cold currents of the Icy Hell.\"\n\nTears flowed down Nian Bing's face unconsciously. \"Yes! They can finally be together. Even if they are imprisoned together, they are still together! Bing Yun, thank you for telling me this. Where is this Icy Hell? Huh? Bing Yun, what's wrong? Why are you sweating so much?\"\n\nNian Bing finally noticed Bing Yun's discomfort. At the same time, he suddenly felt a faint pain in his lower abdomen. He was of dragon blood and wouldn't get sick. The sudden pain made his face change drastically. He pointed at Bing Yun and said, \"You, you poisoned me?\"\n\nBing Yun said sadly, \"This is why I apologized to you earlier. Even if I say I regret it now, you probably won't believe me, will you? It's all too late. Don't worry, master will never kill your parents. The time limit I told you earlier was a lie. I put the fruit you picked earlier into the soup. That should be poison. Let's die together.\"\n\nNian Bing endured the pain in his abdomen and said hatefully, \"Even if I violated you that day, haven't I taken care of you meticulously these past few days? Have you still not let go of your hatred? No, I won't die. I still have to save Dad and Mom. I absolutely will not die.\" Seven-colored light flared, and the Heavenly Eye domain enveloped him and Bing Yun completely. The light element, most effective at dispelling evil and all negative energies, lit up. Milky white light enveloped their bodies. Nian Bing, with his powerful spiritual energy, directly projected the light element towards his lower abdomen.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was activating the light element to expel the toxins from his body, Bing Yun, who had prepared for death, was astonished to find that the pain in her lower abdomen was gradually subsiding. Streams of heat surged forth, invading her meridians. Under the soothing warmth, her entire body felt indescribably comfortable. A hint of flush appeared on her fair skin, and her gaze became somewhat hazy. The deepest desires buried within her heart were stirred by the surging heat. Bing Yun suddenly felt incredibly hot, as if her body were burning. Strange sensations continually arose within her.\n\nNian Bing channeled the light element into his lower abdomen. Under the effect of the vast light element, the painful sensation quickly disappeared. Just as he was about to breathe a sigh of relief, he experienced the same sensation as Bing Yun. A burning heat invaded his entire body. The comfortable feeling made him exhale, thinking to himself that he truly had good karma. Just then, he turned his gaze to Bing Yun and was shocked to see that Bing Yun's face was flushed red, her cherry lips slightly parted, and she was exhaling hot breaths. Her eyes were misty and hazy as she looked at him. Her body writhed on the ground. One hand clutched her full chest, while the other lifted her magic robe and inserted itself deep between her thighs, rubbing gently. The moment his eyes fell upon her slender, shapely legs, Nian Bing felt as if his brain had exploded. The previous heat instantly turned into intense heat, spreading throughout his body in an instant. Even with his strong spiritual energy, at this moment, his eyes could not leave that captivating figure. The intense stimulation made him forget everything, not even feeling his magic power. Even Oscar's anxious calls through their soul were naturally filtered out.",

    "content": "Yu Ruyan looked at Nian Bing's eyes, filled with infinite sorrow, and cried out, \"No, it's no use. Chenchen's heart is destroyed, and no one on the Radiant Continent can save her.\"\n\nNian Bing said anxiously, \"Are there other places? Wherever there is, I will take her there. I will continuously protect her with my innate energy. I will never let her die, even if I have to transfer my heart to her.\" He had never felt such pain in his heart. All his attention was on Bing Yun. As he himself said, if only one of them could survive, he would choose without hesitation.\n\nYu Ruyan shed tears and said, \"It's useless. Your innate energy can't last for too long. Chenchen's life force is already extinguished. Even if we go to the Continent of Gods, it will be difficult to find someone who can use a level twelve Light Magic to reshape her heart!\"\n\nNian Bing understood what level twelve magic meant. It was the Divine Descent Incantation, true Divine Descent Incantation. Only the Divine Descent Incantation of the Light element could save Bing Yun's life. Hearing this, Nian Bing actually smiled, but his smile was so complex. It was the fusion of despair within hope. He glanced at Feng Nu, who was still restrained, and sighed deeply. \"Feng Nu, I'm sorry. I know no matter what I say, it will be difficult to gain your forgiveness. From Bing Yun, I already know the whereabouts of my parents. Although they are imprisoned in the Ice God Tower, they can always be together. I think they must be very satisfied.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Nian Bing placed his hand on the wound on his chest. Milky white light emerged. Under the effect of the Light Healing Technique and the Dragon Body's powerful self-healing ability, the bleeding stopped, and the wound healed quickly.\n\nHe lowered his head and looked deeply at Bing Yun, who had fallen into a semi-conscious state. \"Everything I've done, let me make amends myself. Mother, don't be sad. I know you no longer want to acknowledge me as your son, but I have always regarded you as my birth mother. Level twelve Light Magic? Perhaps, I have a way.\"\n\nYu Ruyan looked at Nian Bing blankly. \"You? Impossible. Even if you can use Light Magic, you can't possess the power of a Divine Descender. Your magic is based on the origin of ice and fire.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"I definitely have a way. Mother, please hold Bing Yun. Everything is up to me.\" With that, he carefully handed Bing Yun in his arms to Yu Ruyan and slowly stood up.\n\nHe concentrated and looked inward. He used his soul to communicate with Oscar. \"Kaka, wake up.\"\n\n\"Boss, I woke up when you were doing that. What's wrong with you? I feel your aura is very abnormal. Looking at you, you're not going to use that method again, are you? This is absolutely not allowed. My life force can only save you once. If you use it again, even if your soul can be preserved, your life force will be completely depleted.\"\n\n\"Kaka, you should know that you can't stop me. The control of this body is still in my hands. All you need to do now is to follow my instructions. After I save Bing Yun, I will probably disappear from this world. What you need to do is to take over this body. After re-controlling this body with your soul, this body will be yours. Although it's not as good as your dragon body, it can at least give you a place to live. I think my departure might be a good thing for you. Remember my words, don't wait until my body ages to do it.\" Saying this, Nian Bing cut off contact with Oscar before he could protest.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Nian Bing cast an apologetic glance at Feng Nu with emotion, then turned and walked in front of Bing Yun. With a flash of light in his hand, the Heaven-and-Earth Piercing Dawn Holy Radiance Saber appeared before him. He inserted the saber into the ground, clasped his hands in front of him, and with a flash of light, the Seven-Colored Sky Eye Domain enveloped him, Bing Yun, and Yu Ruyan. \"Mother, no matter what happens, don't touch my body. I will definitely save Bing Yun. No matter how difficult it is.\"\n\nYu Ruyan suddenly felt a sense of unease. Looking at Nian Bing's calm gaze, her heart trembled slightly. Although she didn't know what Nian Bing was going to do, she vaguely felt that what he was about to do was not simple at all. \"Nian Bing, you...\"\n\nNian Bing raised his hand to stop Yu Ruyan from speaking. He smiled slightly and said, \"I ruined Bing Yun's purity. Wuxiang, she will not be suitable to return to the Ice God Tower in the future. When she wakes up, you can take her back to the Orland Empire.\"\n\nThe seven-colored light of the Sky Eye Domain reached an unprecedented brightness. Gradually, the other six colors of light dimmed, leaving only the soft white light. Nian Bing placed his right hand on the Holy Radiance Stone on the hilt of the Holy Radiance Saber, and the light in his eyes flickered continuously. Looking at the critically ill Bing Yun, he began his incantation without hesitation.\n\n\"With my life as the price, I curse all living beings. With your soul as the price, I curse all elements. With my blood as the guide, with my soul as the melody, I am willing to contribute my life essence to exchange for the infinite power between heaven and earth. Destruction is my hope. I am willing to cast a curse upon myself to exchange for the hope of destruction. Oh, most mysterious curse in the world! I am willing to dedicate myself to you. With the power of the curse as the source, release it, my life. The sigh of the Forbidden Life Curse.\"\n\nCircles of white halos continuously emanated from Nian Bing's body. It was not a sacred aura, nor did it represent light. It was Nian Bing's life force. He had once again used this true forbidden magic, all for the sake of saving Bing Yun's life.\n\nCursing his own life seemed to bring endless power. At this moment, his body seemed to have turned into magical elements. Amidst the flashing white light, Nian Bing's muscles slightly expanded. Burning his life force in its full state instantly raised his magic power to another peak. He continuously stimulated the ice-and-fire dual-origin magic power within his body. Under the effect of the vast mental power of the Sky Eye Acupoint, he rapidly converted various magical elements into light elements. The intense white light was no longer soft. The dazzling light brought golden lightning. The Light Magic burned to its limit, bringing an unusually vast life aura to the entire mountain range.\n\n\"Nian Bing, what are you doing? Stop quickly.\" Although Yu Ruyan didn't understand magic, she understood the reason for her unease from Nian Bing's incantation.\n\nNian Bing said sternly, \"Mother, don't stop me. My life has already begun to burn. If Bing Yun is not saved, my sacrifice will be in vain. Use your Dou Qi to protect Bing Yun's body and receive my Light Power.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Nian Bing guided his hands, further strengthening his magic output. The entire cave was filled with vast light elements, which were singing joyfully. The light elements in the air were drawn to Nian Bing by an immense attraction. At this point, Nian Bing held nothing back, fully integrating his innate energy into this massive light element. In an instant, the Sky Eye Domain disappeared, replaced by a giant white light shield, a white light shield that shone with a faint golden light.\n\nPreviously, when Nian Bing was still a Magus, he had used the Life Curse once. Even facing the ultimate forbidden spell cast by the powerful Lich, Xie Yue, after his Life Curse, he had almost failed. Now, Nian Bing had become a true Archmage. Not only had his Sky Eye Acupoint evolved to the middle stage, but his Li Zhong Acupoint had also opened. At this moment, coupled with the frantic burning of his life force, although Light Magic was not his strongest suit, with the help of the Holy Radiance Stone, he had forcibly elevated himself to the level of a Divine Descender.\n\nThis second Life Curse was originally reserved by Nian Bing for revenge. If his parents were truly dead and there was no other way, he would definitely choose to burn his life to gain powerful magic to avenge his parents. However, now he chose to use it. He didn't want Bing Yun to die. He didn't know how to face Yu Ruyan and Feng Nu, so his choice was made without hesitation.\n\nThe vast light elements, under the effect of the materialized mental power, did not leak out but were contained within a ten-foot radius around Nian Bing's body. Under the effect of the light elements, the residual injuries in his body completely disappeared, and the wounds on Bing Yun's chest healed quickly.\n\nThe light elements, the sacred light elements, had solidified into substance at this moment, and under Nian Bing's control, they were preparing for what was to come.\n\nTaking a deep breath, when Nian Bing felt his life force was about to burn to its limit, he finally began to chant the ancient incantation he had memorized in the Mage Guild of the Ice Moon Empire. \"Light, you bring warmth to the earth and nurture all life. You are the Light of Life. Light, you bring vitality to the world and quell some evil. You are the Holy Light. Light, you bring me sincere faith and open the door of hope. You are the Light of Hope, you are the Light of Faith. As a believer of Light, I beg you, open the gates of heaven and bestow upon me the dawn that pierces heaven and earth, transform into a true angel, and spread the light of God throughout the land. Great God of Light! I am willing to exchange my endless faith for the pursuit of you. God! I am willing to abandon all worldly things to gain your help. God! Please send your messenger to help your most loyal follower.\"\n\nThe white light stopped fluctuating with Nian Bing's soaring incantation. The sacred white light gradually changed. Suddenly, all the milky white light instantly turned golden. Nian Bing let out a high cry, and the golden light shot upwards like lightning. Nothing could stop the vast divine light. The rocks above turned into powder and disappeared. The golden light pierced through the entire mountain peak, blasting out a cylindrical space with a diameter of ten feet, shooting straight into the sky.\n\nThe golden light disappeared at a point beyond the range of sight. At this moment, the mountain peak above Nian Bing violently exploded. The huge roar shook the entire mountain range. A towering mountain peak disappeared in the golden light filled with divine aura, truly disappeared, completely disappeared. With the cave as the horizontal line, the area where Nian Bing was located became a wide platform.\n\nHe released his hand holding the Holy Radiance Stone. The Heaven-and-Earth Piercing Dawn—Holy Radiance Saber floated up. The position of the Holy Radiance Stone was parallel to Nian Bing's forehead. Nian Bing spread his arms, raised his head, and followed the expanding golden light with his gaze. At this moment, his life force had finally burned to its limit. No matter where on his body, it was completely enveloped by the golden light within the limit. The vast divine light fluctuated with his mental power. At this moment, Nian Bing had entered a wonderful world. He clearly felt that his mental power, along with the vast divine light, seemed to have communicated with the light elements in every corner of the continent. All the light elements were resonating with the shining of the divine light. The power of God, the true power of God, is to communicate with all elements of the same nature. Nian Bing finally understood the mystery of the Divine Descent Incantation. Although he knew it was no longer important to him, at this moment, he had truly become a Divine Descender, a Divine Descender of the Light element.\n\nThe sky began to change. The sun's light seemed to have been affected by the divine light and turned golden. The clouds floating in the sky gradually disappeared. The Ice Goddess's Sacred Rite that was originally in the Ice Moon Empire, which brought coldness under the influence of the ice waterfall, caused the temperature to slowly rise. The active light elements brought a vast life aura to the entire Ice Moon Empire. Withered plants regained their vitality. All living beings were nourished in this aura of light. Everyone stopped what they were doing, looked up, and worshipped the golden sun in the sky. They didn't know what had happened, but they could imagine that the descent of God, only the descent of a true God, would bring all this! For a time, the entire Ice Moon Empire was filled with faith and piety towards the light. With the power of this faith and piety, the resonating light elements rapidly converged towards Nian Bing's location. They were breathing, murmuring, and cheering.\n\nOnly one person understood what had happened, and that was the Ice Goddess's Sacred Rite, who was still in the Imperial Palace of the Ice Moon Empire.\n\nOpening her eyes, which seemed to be able to see through everything in the world, her deep eyes were filled with surprise. With a flash of light, she appeared outside the next moment. Looking up at the golden sky, the surprise in her eyes instantly increased.\n\n\"Ah! Could it be that someone from the Continent of Gods has come to the Radiant Continent? This is the Divine Descent Incantation of the Light element. Who on the Radiant Continent is using this Divine Descent Incantation that can bring dawn to the earth? Such powerful Light Power!\" As a Divine Descender herself, she could clearly feel the active light elements in the air. Following the guidance of the light elements, she seemed to see the source of the light.",

    "content": "She naturally didn't understand why, but at this moment, she realized that the Light Divine Descent Technique was more powerful than her own Ice Divine Descent Technique, because it was a Divine Descent Technique whose greatest effect could be unleashed with the support of countless devout believers! Unfortunately, she also knew that this Divine Descent Technique was not enough to threaten her, because only a Divine Descent Technique used for healing could emit such a light of hope, bathing everyone in hope, allowing everyone to see the dawn of life. With these curiosities, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess ascended, relying on her perception of light elements and led by those light elements full of devotion and faith, she headed towards the source of the light. However, the light elements were too vast, and because each light element had a different trajectory, the aura she felt was also different. Although she could sense the general direction, it would still take some time to truly find the source of the light.\n\nAt the same time, another person also felt this extraordinary light.\n\nOn the continent of Yangguang, a dark aura in a certain place forcefully dispersed all light elements within the cave and completely isolated it from the outside. Although Xie Yue was bearing the immense pressure of the sacred light from outside alone, this sacred light was not directed at him. With his strength as a Dark Divine Descent Master, these light elements posed no threat to him. He not only protected himself and his subordinates but also completely hid his aura, unafraid of being detected by his imagined enemy. Little did he know that this sacred light was not directed at him at all.\n\nThe most surprised by the change in the sky would have to be the Seven Dragon Kings. Pulled by their vital energies, whether it was Galamantis of Ice Snow City or the other six Dragon Kings in the Cold Ridge, they all simultaneously left their locations and soared into the sky.\n\nThe Light Dragon King exclaimed, \"Not good, this is the power Nian Bing is using! Kaka just informed me, Nian Bing is likely in big trouble. Let's hurry!\" She could also use the same Light Divine Descent Technique, but even with her power as the Light Dragon King, she couldn't spread the light to such an extent. This was an unrestrained release.\n\nThe Dark Dragon King Kajiosiss, enduring physical discomfort, said, \"Nian Bing seems to be saving someone. Why didn't he bring the person back for us to rescue? Dimanteti, what did Kaka say?\"\n\nDimanteti said solemnly, \"Kaka's mental power isn't strong yet. It only sent me a fragment, but even without it, I can understand what's happening. Nian Bing's progress is very fast, but for him to use this kind of power, it must be...\"\n\nThe other five Dragon Kings exclaimed in unison, \"He used the Curse of Life again.\"\n\nThe Wind Dragon King Caroliris frowned, \"How can Nian Bing be so reckless? He used the Curse of Life again, I'm afraid even we can't save him now. Hurry, let's go stop him, maybe there's still time.\"\n\nThe Space Dragon King Kaodilis's eyes flickered with a strange light, \"Stop him? No chance! Even if I use long-distance space transfer magic, I can't lock onto his location. By the time we get there, his magic will definitely be completed. What's Galamantis doing? How could he let him use this magic?\"\n\nKaodilis reminded Kajiosiss, \"That's right, Galamantis should be by his side. I'll contact him now.\"\n\nIn fact, without Kajiosiss's contact, the Fire Dragon King in Ice Snow City had already set off. Upon sensing the change in light elements and Kaka's call to the dragons, he immediately realized that Nian Bing was in trouble. Although he also suspected that Nian Bing might be saving someone, he also thought of Nian Bing's fated enemy – the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. In his urgent state, he didn't even have time to say goodbye to his disciple Xue Jing before rushing towards Ice Moon City at the fastest speed.\n\nAmong the Seven Dragon Kings, Galamantis was the most familiar with Nian Bing. Not only did he sense it through his own perception of light elements, but he also found the precise location through his familiarity with Nian Bing's aura, flying at his limit towards Nian Bing's location.\n\n...\n\nNian Bing suddenly realized that he could no longer feel the loss of life force. The continuously replenished light elements made his consumption far less than he had imagined. The light had burned to a fixed point, and he knew it was time to proceed to the next step.\n\n\"Great God of Light, your envoy has descended upon the mortal world. The arrival of hope and dawn will bring me my greatest wish. The arrival of hope and dawn has granted me your power. Angel of Light, appear!\"\n\nThe light illuminated the earth, and all the golden light instantly contracted. Nian Bing's body floated up from the ground. Under the effect of the strong divine light, six golden wings formed entirely of energy appeared, gracefully emerging from his back. At this moment, his Heavenly Eye acupuncture point was fully open, and his body was covered in a layer of gray dragon scales. The scales on his chest were golden, and the silver Heavenly Eye on his forehead was opened to its maximum. Using the Heavenly Eye acupuncture point, which had entered the intermediate stage, he continuously condensed the vast light elements towards himself.\n\nNian Bing smiled. He had originally been unsure if he could use this magic, but now the facts told him that he had actually succeeded. At this moment, his heart was filled with joy, not only for reaching the level of a Divine Descent Master before his death but also for being able to save Bing Yun. With this Divine Descent Technique, let alone Bing Yun's heart being damaged, even if her internal organs were completely destroyed, Nian Bing was confident he could regenerate them.\n\n\"Angel of Light, you have bestowed upon me the power of light. Please allow me to use your most primal healing light, carrying the purest light in the world, to save the life before me. Divine Descent, Angel's Tear.\"\n\nNian Bing's body flew horizontally, floating above Bing Yun's body. His white hair at this moment returned to its original golden color. He slowly closed his eyes. At this moment, his heart was only on Bing Yun. He recalled everything that had happened between him and Bing Yun, recalling the moment when desire reached its peak. A faint smile appeared on Nian Bing's face.\n\nA drop of incredibly crystalline golden tear fell gracefully from the corner of his eye. At this moment, time seemed to stand still. That golden drop was so clear in Yu Ruyan's eyes. Her dissatisfaction with Nian Bing completely disappeared. A man willing to sacrifice his life for his daughter, what did it matter if their daughter gave him her chastity? Nothing was important. Even the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess of the Ice God Tower could no longer change Yu Ruyan's acceptance of Nian Bing.\n\nThe golden tear silently sliced through the air, creating ripples like water wherever it passed, as if the air itself was weeping for this purest Angel's Tear in the world.\n\nThe golden tear fell peacefully. When it touched the wound on Bing Yun's chest, all traces of the wound disappeared, not even a scar was left. Bing Yun's skin emitted a lustrous glow. That golden tear had completely merged into her body, merging into her heart.\n\nThe golden light rapidly spread to every part of Bing Yun's body. Under the effect of the vast light elements, her body broke free from Yu Ruyan's grasp and floated up gracefully like Nian Bing. Nian Bing smiled slightly, looking at Bing Yun before him, \"Perhaps I was wrong, perhaps I was right, but no matter what, I have no regrets. Wake up, my love.\"\n\nA silver light suddenly shot from his Heavenly Eye acupuncture point, entering directly through Bing Yun's forehead. Bing Yun's entire body trembled violently. The previously retracted ice-blue wings spread open again, and golden light spread across her wings, completely dyeing the Ice Phoenix Royal Feathers golden. Angel's Tear had completely shaped a golden heart for Bing Yun.\n\nWith a slight tremor, a stable and strong heartbeat sounded again.\n\nThe Light Divine Descent Technique, which defied natural creation, pulled Bing Yun back from the brink of death, granting her a new life.\n\nA speck of silver light lit up from Bing Yun's forehead, and a faint slit slowly began to open.\n\nWhen Nian Bing realized how vast the light elements condensed from his life-burning were, before the energy disappeared, he not only used Angel's Tear to regenerate Bing Yun's heart but also used the remaining energy, guided by his Heavenly Eye acupuncture point and based on the light elements that had fused with the essence of heaven and earth, to help Bing Yun open her first acupoint in her life, the Heavenly Eye acupuncture point.\n\nWhen Bing Yun slowly opened her eyes, she saw Nian Bing before her. Nian Bing, enveloped in golden light, looked so tall at this moment. Illuminated by the six golden wings behind him, Nian Bing, radiating golden light, was a perfect embodiment in her eyes.\n\n\"Bing, have I died? I'm content even if I can see you in my imagination after death. Don't go, okay?\" Bing Yun murmured softly.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Mom, I hope you won't object to me calling you that again. I just want you to know that the son you adopted is not a bad person.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the six golden wings on his back moved gracefully, and with a flash of golden light, he appeared before the restrained Phoenix Girl.\n\nGolden light enveloped the Phoenix Girl's body, slowly lifting her into the air. He raised his hand, and the tear tracks on the Phoenix Girl's face disappeared in the light emanating from Nian Bing. \"Don't cry, okay? Phoenix Girl, I don't know how to explain to you, and I think no explanation can compensate for the harm I've caused you. What I can tell you is that you are the first woman I fell in love with, you were, you are, and you always will be. My feelings for you will never change, even until the end of time. I don't want to explain anything. Please remember me. When you're bored, I hope my image will appear in your heart.\"\n\nThe Phoenix Girl's tears stopped flowing, but another golden tear flowed from the corner of Nian Bing's eye. The golden light seemed to be held in his hand, carrying a crystalline radiance, and it gracefully merged into the Phoenix Girl's collar, into her skin, into her heart. The same Angel's Tear, no longer for healing, but for nourishment.\n\nThe Phoenix Girl felt as if her whole body was in a furnace, and a strong heat current came from her heart, spreading throughout her body in an instant. At this moment, she deeply felt Nian Bing's boundless love for her. The Phoenix Clan Royal Feathers on her back spread wide, and golden light emerged from her skin, rapidly spreading towards her wings. That dense golden light enveloped her, transforming her into the same form as Bing Yun. Her originally pink hair turned blue. Nian Bing knew that Bing Yun's hair resembled her mother, while the Phoenix Girl's hair resembled her father, Lan Yu. Her previously pink hair was probably due to practicing the special techniques of the Phoenix Clan.\n\nAlthough the Phoenix Girl couldn't speak due to her mother's restraint, she could clearly feel Nian Bing transforming her body. Seeing Nian Bing's clear eyes turned golden, a strong sense of unease welled up in her heart, and tears continuously slid down her face. From her eyes, Nian Bing saw that she had already forgiven him.\n\nNian Bing's heart felt warm. He could feel his body gradually weakening and knew he couldn't wait any longer. His eyes shone brightly, and another silver light shot from his Heavenly Eye, directly into the Phoenix Girl's forehead.\n\nThe Phoenix Girl trembled all over. Under the effect of the vast mental power and innate energy that Nian Bing injected, she immediately fainted.\n\nTaking a deep breath and feeling his unprecedentedly vast mental power, Nian Bing gazed at the sky.",

    "content": "\"Ling'er, I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can no longer take care of you. This is the last thing I can do for you.\" Golden light blazed to its limit once more. Nian Bing gathered his final energy, let out a high-pitched cry to the heavens, closed his eyes, and the third tear of an angel appeared. This time, the tear of an angel shot straight into the sky. A powerful silver light shot out from Nian Bing's celestial eye, carrying the tear of an angel, and vanished into the horizon in the blink of an eye.\n\nHaving released his final energy, the golden light in Nian Bing's eyes dimmed. The golden sky gradually returned to normal. The silver eye on his forehead closed tiredly. The six golden wings on his back turned into illusions and disappeared. The light-element divine descent spell, Angel's Tear, finally ended as Nian Bing exhausted all his energy.\n\nThe golden light gradually receded. The first to shed its light was Nian Bing's recently restored golden hair. He stumbled a bit, and the golden light wings gradually detached. This time, he was no longer white, but a lifeless gray. His long gray hair, devoid of any luster, floated neatly behind him. This time, he did not age rapidly; the draining of his vitality caused his spirit to gradually wane. Looking at Bing Yun and Feng Nü, who were unconscious, a gentle smile appeared on his face. Yu Ru Yan said, \"Mother, please take good care of them. This is all I can leave for them now. Kaka, take over my body.\"\n\nWith his last shred of mental energy, Nian Bing forcibly reined in his soul. Before the life curse ended, he sent his soul into the Tianyan acupoint to seal it himself. His body, filled with a deathly stillness, slowly collapsed to the ground, devoid of any sign of life.\n\nYu Ru Yan cried out in surprise and quickly supported Nian Bing. When her hand touched him, Nian Bing's body was already ice-cold. If his body hadn't been modified by the Dragon Soul, he would have withered and aged by now. Inside Nian Bing's body, Oscar's energy meter, filled with a suppressed aura, finally released after Nian Bing's oppression and blockage. Oscar's heart ached terribly. No one understood better than he what had happened to Nian Bing. He knew that Nian Bing had done this because he could not forgive himself. Otherwise, if he had simply healed Bing Yun and canceled the divine descent, he would have at least retained half of his life force. But now, Nian Bing had fallen into a deep slumber. A complete slumber. This time, it was more direct than the last; he himself had sought death!\n\nA chilling aura enveloped the cave entrance. With a surprised \"Oh?\", an ice-like figure appeared at the entrance. \"Ru Yan, how is it you? Did you cast that light-element divine descent spell just now?\"\n\nYu Ru Yan looked up dazedly. She saw the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, her face filled with surprise. \"Senior.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess floated forward, arriving beside Yu Ru Yan. She immediately saw Bing Yun, Feng Nü, and Nian Bing on the ground. Nian Bing's deathly still appearance startled her. \"No wonder I haven't been able to find Bing Yun's aura these past few days. So she was captured by him. What happened to Bing Yun? Why is the light aura on her so strong?\"\n\nYu Ru Yan said bitterly, \"I don't know what's going on. Chen Chen's purity was violated by Nian Bing. When I rushed over, I intended to teach Nian Bing a lesson, but Chen Chen blocked a sword for me. My battle qi pierced her heart. Nian Bing, in order to save Chen Chen, cast that magic. Was that a divine descent spell?\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's expression changed drastically. \"What did you say? Yun'er's virginity was broken. You bastard, I'll tear him to shreds!\" As she spoke, she raised her hand and sent a surge of cold air towards Nian Bing's body.\n\n\"No.\" Silver battle qi blocked the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's attack. Yu Ru Yan stood in front of Nian Bing.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said with slight anger, \"Ru Yan, what are you doing? Bing Yun is your daughter.\"\n\nYu Ru Yan sighed and said, \"Senior, Nian Bing is already gone. Why must you desecrate his corpse? Bing Yun said as she was dying that everything that happened between her and Nian Bing was her own will. Moreover, Nian Bing sacrificed his life to save her. His sins are atoned. He is my godson, and I want to give him a proper burial.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess crouched down and felt Bing Yun's pulse. Through mental probing, she quickly discovered the situation. \"Angel's Tear? It's actually the Angel's Tear, renowned as the most compassionate in the divine descent spells. Impossible, with this brat's ability, he couldn't possibly cast this magic. He was at most a Magus, and not even a light-element mage. How could he cast a light-element divine descent spell? Ru Yan, what happened just now? How did he manage to cast this light magic that illuminates the continent?\"\n\nYu Ru Yan sighed and briefly recounted everything that had happened. After hearing her account, a peculiar gleam appeared in the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's eyes. \"So that's how it is. He burned his entire life to cast the divine descent spell.\" She glanced at the Holy Radiance Blade on the ground. \"Coupled with this top-tier light-element treasure, he was able to cast Angel's Tear. Ru Yan, you're lying to me, aren't you? How could Bing Yun willingly have that divine affair with this scoundrel? Bing Yun, since childhood, under my tutelage, had already abandoned romantic love and focused on magic.\"\n\nYu Ru Yan shook her head and said, \"Who can truly understand the feelings between men and women? Senior, Bing Yun has lost her virginity, and her Royal Plumage has awakened. I think she is no longer suitable to stay in the Ice God Tower. I want to take her back to the Oran Empire.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess adamantly refused, \"No, Bing Yun is my disciple. Even if she lost her virginity, you can't take her back. Have you forgotten? The first time you brought her to the Ice God Tower, I said that once you enter my sect, you can never regret it. If it weren't for me, could you have protected your daughter from the pursuit of the Phoenix clan? Moreover, when you sent Bing Yun to the Ice God Tower, she was born with the Nine Cold Body. If it weren't for my meticulous guidance in transforming the Nine Cold Body into a physique suitable for practicing ice-element magic, you probably would have died by now. What? Now that you see her Nine Cold Body has been dispelled by the effect of Angel's Tear, you want to take her back?\"\n\nYu Ru Yan's expression changed slightly. \"Senior, what you said is indeed true. For so many years, I have always been grateful for your teachings to Chen Chen. However, Nian Bing is dead now, and Chen Chen has suffered such a great blow. I must keep her by my side to comfort her properly. Our family has finally reunited. Please grant my request, Senior.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's expression turned cold. \"There's no need to say more. Bing Yun must return with me to the Ice God Tower. From the day she entered the Ice God Tower, she ceased to be your daughter. I allow her to visit home once a year; that is already the greatest leniency. Since you wish to go back on your word now, I will ensure you never see her again.\"\n\nSilver sacred battle qi burned around Yu Ru Yan's body. She stepped forward, gazing at the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. \"No one can snatch away my daughter, not even you, Senior.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said coldly, \"What? Do you intend to fight me? Although you are the most accomplished among the Phoenix clan, you are still far from being able to contend with me.\"\n\nThe silver light on Yu Ru Yan's body intensified. Her dark green hair fluttered backward under the effect of the battle qi. She stated firmly, \"Senior, for my daughter, I can give everything, including my own life.\" As she spoke, she lightly clapped a palm towards the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. The condensed sacred battle qi formed a stream in the air, silently heading towards the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's chest. She did not expect this full-power palm strike to defeat the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess; she merely wanted to force her out of the cave.\n\nFacing the full-power palm strike of a Martial Saint, who was close to the God-Teacher level, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess did not retreat. There was also insufficient time for her to chant an incantation. She flipped her right hand and unleashed a palm strike as well. Golden light, surrounded by a blue hexagram, floated out serenely. Under the lock of mental energy, it met Yu Ru Yan's attack head-on.\n\nYu Ru Yan never expected the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess to be able to contend with her in such a way. As their battle qi clashed, with a soft \"chi\" sound, both their bodies trembled simultaneously. However, the Ice Snow Goddess remained stationary, while Yu Ru Yan, who had activated her Royal Plumage, retreated a step. Her expression changed instantly, and she exclaimed, \"Huangji Acupoint! You've actually opened the Huangji Acupoint!\" Besides this reason, she truly couldn't think of any other way the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess could contend with her sacred battle qi.\n\n\"That's right. You do have some discernment. Now, do you think you can still contend with me?\" The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess looked at Yu Ru Yan calmly.\n\nYu Ru Yan took a sharp breath. Originally, she thought she could still contend with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess with her Phoenix Illusionary Body and Nine Transformations. Although she definitely couldn't win, she at least had some chance of taking her two daughters away. As long as Feng Nü woke up, escaping with the combined power of mother and daughter should not be a problem. However, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had actually opened the third acupoint, the most powerful Huangji Acupoint. She knew very well that she could not possibly defeat her opponent.\n\nSeeing Yu Ru Yan's silence, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said indifferently, \"Good, I'll give you a chance. I believe you wouldn't want Bing Yun to be harmed. Let's go outside. As long as you can defeat me, I'll let you take Bing Yun away.\" Her words were filled with strong confidence. After all, for so many years, she had been an invincible existence.\n\nYu Ru Yan took a deep breath, her mind already made up. \"Do I have a choice, esteemed Ice Snow Goddess Priestess?\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said coldly, \"The reason I was willing to take in Bing Yun back then was partly because I pitied you, and partly because Bing Yun indeed had great potential. Since she is already my disciple, I will not let you take her away. Come.\" As she spoke, she floated out of the cave, framed by blue light.\n\nYu Ru Yan glanced at Bing Yun and Feng Nü on the ground, took a deep breath, and followed her out. Her only hope now was for Feng Nü to wake up soon; only then would there be a chance to escape.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess floated in mid-air. Masses of ice elements condensed into beautiful ice flowers, floating around her body. Seeing Yu Ru Yan spread her wings and follow, she said coldly, \"Show me your strongest abilities, otherwise, you won't be convinced even if you lose.\"\n\nYu Ru Yan let out a low roar, activating the Phoenix Illusionary Body. Her physical body seemed to merge with flames and became illusory. Scorching airflow surged out, and monstrous flames converged into a column, forming a vortex of fire. The Phoenix Nine Transformations transitioned from the second transformation, Royal Plumage, into the third transformation. In an instant, her silver battle qi transformed into the Phoenix clan's unique Nine Li Heavenly Fire. Under the burning of the golden flames, her aura surged, pushing the oppressive coldness around her body outward.\n\nYu Ru Yan cried out to the heavens. The flames dyed her clear eyes golden. Golden flames instantly covered an area of three zhang around her, soaring into the sky. The clouds in the sky were completely dyed blood-red under the illumination of the red light. The edges of the red wings on her back shimmered with a faint golden light. Strangely, the seemingly intense flames did not carry any heat; this was a special effect produced by the extreme burning of Nine Li battle qi.\n\n\"Phoenix Shadow Three Divisions.\" A flash of red light appeared in the three-zhang diameter sea of red. Three figures emerged, three perfectly identical illusory Yu Ru Yans, with the same fiery red wings and golden eyes.\n\nSensing Yu Ru Yan's power, a faint divine light appeared in the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's eyes. With a low chant, the aura of ice gradually strengthened, suppressing the approaching Nine Li aura from Yu Ru Yan. Yu Ru Yan underestimated her, but she also underestimated Yu Ru Yan, the top expert of the Oran Empire.\n\nThe three Yu Ru Yans, with their wings spread, spoke in unison, \"The true color of a phoenix is neither red nor gold. According to legends, our ancestor, the phoenix, had the head of a chicken, the neck of a snake, the jaw of a swallow, the back of a turtle, the tail of a fish, and its feathers were of five colors. The fifth transformation of the Phoenix Nine Transformations: Phoenix Vibrating Wings, Five Colors Moving.\"\n\nThe first to change were the wings behind the three Yu Ru Yans. The original golden-red light rippled with five-colored patterns. Although still based on golden-red, the wings, rendered with five-colored light, looked much more magnificent. The three bodies simultaneously extended their right hands, and five-colored flames condensed in their hands, forming a feather-like object about three feet long. The three bodies and six wings flapped simultaneously, and the passionate phoenix cry resounded through the heavens and earth.\n\nThe three Yu Ru Yans in their fifth transformation put immense pressure on the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. Her expression also became solemn. The three acupoints on her right hand, chest, and lower abdomen simultaneously released golden and silver light. Two golden and one silver light, supported by innate energy, formed a close-fitting light shield, enveloping the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's body. At this moment, Yu Ru Yan was no longer just a Martial Saint, but three Martial Saints representing the peak of the Martial Saint realm, and three completely synchronized Martial Saints. Her Phoenix Shadow Clone was far more than just an illusion.",

    "content": "To save her daughter, Yu Ruyan held nothing back. The three figures simultaneously raised the Phoenix Feathers in their hands, meeting at a point in the air. Five-colored light swirled around that point, condensing. Under the fierce fluctuations of the Jiu Li Dou Qi, her body transformed again. \"Xiao Shao ninety percent, Phoenix Emperor arrives.\" The three figures simultaneously turned into five-colored lightning, instantly merging into the mass of five-colored light emanating from the three Phoenix Feathers. The three Phoenix Feathers rotated, and the five-colored light flared, with a phoenix's cry piercing the heavens within the expanding radiance. \"Phoenix - Phoenix - Sixth - Transformation - Body - Like - Phoenix!\" The Sixth Transformation. Yes, Yu Ruyan had completed the sixth transformation of the Phoenix Nine Transformations. It was precisely because she could reach the sixth transformation that she was the Martial Saint closest to a God Master.\n\nA giant ten-zhang-long five-colored phoenix floated in mid-air, five-colored ripples constantly expanding outwards. Under the immense pressure, the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's body, floating in the ice, was forced a hundred zhang away.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's expression finally changed. Yu Ruyan, transformed into a colorful phoenix, had already reached the peak of her strength. She knew very well that unless she used the Divine Descent technique again, she could not possibly defeat Yu Ruyan. She had overestimated Yu Ruyan, but she found that she had still miscalculated. If it were in the past, she would have unhesitatingly used the Divine Descent technique to defeat Yu Ruyan. The dignity of the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice would not allow anyone to offend her. But at this moment, could she still do that? Not long ago, forcefully using forbidden spells without incantations, followed by the Divine Descent technique, had severely injured her, and she had not yet recovered. Facing such a powerful opponent, if she used the Divine Descent technique again, it was likely to cause irreparable damage. At this moment, the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice hesitated.\n\nThe giant colorful phoenix in the sky circled once, its ten-zhang-wide wings spread, facing the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice. Yu Ruyan's voice rang out, \"Senior, you have taught Bingyun for many years, and I truly do not wish to fight you. However, I cannot lose my daughter. Please let Bingyun go.\"\n\nPride overcame reason. The Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's protective golden-silver light suddenly intensified. \"The dignity of a god cannot be violated. Yu Ruyan, I told you, enter my sect and never regret it. I want to see if your Phoenix Tribe's Sixth Transformation can contend with my Divine Descent technique.\"\n\nJust as the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice was about to chant the incantation, a clear dragon's roar came from afar. A tiny red cloud continuously expanded, arriving before them in just a few blinks of an eye. It was a fiery red giant dragon. Its colossal body was no smaller than Yu Ruyan's transformed colorful phoenix. Its dragon wings spread, and the wind was torn apart. Due to its extreme speed, a faint afterimage trailed behind its massive body.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice stopped the incantation she was about to begin, frowning as she looked at the approaching fiery red giant dragon. The aura of fire was what she detested the most, and she clearly felt that the energy attached to this fire dragon was no less than her Divine Descent technique.\n\nIt was the Fire Dragon King Galanadis. He sensed something was wrong with Nian Bing and immediately rushed over at full speed. To achieve the maximum flying speed, he had reverted to his true form. On the way, he heard the call of the Six Dragon Kings. Without time to explain why he wasn't by Nian Bing's side, he rushed over. When Nian Bing used the light element Divine Descent technique, he knew it was bad, but he no longer had time to hesitate, only hoping that his arrival was still in time. However, as he set off from Ice Snow City, he still arrived a step later than the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice, who was right there.\n\nFrom afar, Galanadis saw Yu Ruyan, who was transforming into a phoenix. Although Yu Ruyan had transformed into a colorful phoenix, Galanadis, having seen her before, recognized her at a glance. Seeing Yu Ruyan, he breathed a sigh of relief. He knew Yu Ruyan's strength very well. Nian Bing's aura had disappeared near here, and he thought that with Yu Ruyan present, Nian Bing should not be in too much danger.\n\nStopping before the colorful phoenix transformed by Yu Ruyan, Galanadis opened his dragon mouth and said, \"En, little phoenix, we meet again. I said last time that your Phoenix Nine Transformations had reached beyond the Fifth Transformation. It seems my judgment was correct. Oh, and who is this! Isn't this that Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice? En, only your ice element magic can reach this level among humans.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice said in a deep voice, \"Dragon race, your dragon race has always been dormant on the continent. If I remember correctly, in the records, dragons cannot interfere in human affairs.\" The appearance of the Fire Dragon King immediately threw her into disarray. One Yu Ruyan was already difficult to deal with, and with a fire-element giant dragon no weaker than herself, she knew she had no chance of winning.\n\nGalanadis chuckled and said, \"Of course, I won't interfere. However, this little phoenix is the godmother of my friend. I can't just watch you deal with her. If you attack her, and I take a hit, then I can retaliate, right?\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice said coldly, \"Fine, remember your words today. If one day I reach the Divine Continent, I will report your words to the gods.\"\n\nGalanadis snorted dismissively and said, \"Do you think I'm afraid? We dragons are the noblest race. You, a mere human, dare to threaten me? You have offended the dignity of the dragon race, and I have the right to challenge you. I think those so-called gods on the Divine Continent won't speak up for you either.\" Since the most powerful main gods fell into slumber after the War of the Gods' Legacy, the Dragon God's status on the Divine Continent had greatly increased. Although the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's strength could already be compared to ordinary gods, as an arrogant Fire Dragon King, Galanadis did not take her seriously.\n\n\"You...\" The Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's eyes flashed with cold light. Just as she was about to use the Divine Descent technique regardless of the consequences, Galanadis's words made her dismiss the idea.\n\n\"Don't think you're the strongest human and that means something. If the little phoenix and I were to perform a Dragon-Phoenix Harmony, even if you used the Divine Descent technique, you would only have a dead end. If you're smart, get lost immediately. At another time, I, the Fire Dragon King Galanadis, will await your retaliation at any time.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice took a deep breath, forcefully suppressing the anger in her heart. She gave Galanadis a fierce look and suddenly accelerated, turning into a blue light that disappeared in the blink of an eye.\n\nGalanadis snorted and said, \"As a human, to cultivate to this level on the Yangguang Continent is quite remarkable. I really didn't expect her to have opened three acupoints, and one of them is the Royal Acupoint. If her Royal Acupoint evolves to the intermediate stage, I might not be able to handle her either.\" After all, he was a Dragon King, and with just one glance at the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's protective divine light, he could judge her strength.\n\nWith a flash of red light, Galanadis transformed into a human and looked at Yu Ruyan's transformed colorful phoenix. \"Little phoenix, why are you here too? And why are you fighting with that guy again?\"\n\nThe colorful light receded, and Yu Ruyan returned to her human form. Her complexion looked somewhat pale. Although she could use the sixth transformation of the Phoenix Nine Transformations, it had indeed reached her limit. If she had truly fought the Ice Snow Goddess, the outcome was imaginable. Before reaching the seventh transformation, her strength was not enough to contend with a Divine Descent Master.\n\nYu Ruyan sighed lightly and said, \"She wanted to capture my daughter, so I started fighting her. Ah! Senior, please come quickly and see if Nian Bing can still be saved. He is probably...\"\n\nGalanadis's heart was startled. \"Quick, take me there.\"\n\nLed by Yu Ruyan, they returned to the cave in an instant. Upon seeing Nian Bing's condition, Galanadis's heart sank. He cursed, \"This reckless kid, he actually used the Life Curse again. This damned magic is like drinking poison to quench thirst, and he even used light magic. Damn it, this time he's truly dead.\" Although he was cursing, his hands had already pulled Nian Bing up, inputting his pure fire element into Nian Bing's body to check his condition.\n\nWith a soft cry, Phoenix Girl opened her eyes, waking from her unconsciousness. Unlike Bingyun, who suffered severe injuries, Nian Bing's Tears of the Angel and mental power quickly merged completely with her body, allowing her to enter the Innate Realm.\n\n\"Ah! Where is Nian Bing? Mother, how is Nian Bing? He...\" As soon as Phoenix Girl woke up, she looked for Nian Bing. She saw Nian Bing in Galanadis's arms at a glance. Seeing his lifeless appearance, Phoenix Girl's heart trembled. She flashed before Nian Bing and grabbed his hand. Nian Bing's hand was very cold, and Phoenix Girl clearly felt that there was not a trace of life force left in his body.\n\n\"How could this happen? Why did this happen?\" Phoenix Girl stared blankly at Nian Bing's \"corpse.\"\n\nGalanadis said in a deep voice, \"You should ask yourselves. Why would Nian Bing use his ultimate power? Did you not think that if he didn't pay the price of cursing his own life, how could he use light magic, which he is not skilled at, to reach the level of Divine Descent technique?\"\n\nJust then, Nian Bing's body trembled, and his skin shone with a layer of gray luster. He slowly opened his eyes. Except for his hair, which was still gray, he seemed to have regained his spirit. He exerted his waist and actually stood up. \"Uncle, let me tell you what happened.\"\n\n\"Nian Bing.\" Phoenix Girl cried out joyfully, about to throw herself into \"Nian Bing's\" arms, but she was stopped by \"Nian Bing\" extending a hand. \"Don't, sister-in-law, don't do that. If Nian Bing can live in the future, I'm afraid he won't spare me even if I hugged you, even though this is his body.\"\n\nPhoenix Girl was slightly stunned. Looking at the \"Nian Bing\" before her, she felt a strange feeling. Although it was still Nian Bing, the aura of this Nian Bing was completely different from the original. She couldn't say what was different, but she could clearly feel it.\n\nYu Ruyan looked at \"Nian Bing\" in surprise and said, \"Didn't you die? How...\"\n\nGalanadis said, \"He is not Nian Bing. His name is Oscar. He is the child of my friend, Kaka. For some reason, he shares this body with Nian Bing's soul. Now, Nian Bing is probably truly dead, and Kaka is controlling this body. This is Nian Bing's godmother. You can call her Auntie.\" Involuntarily, he elevated Yu Ruyan to the same generation as himself.\n\nYu Ruyan and Phoenix Girl found it difficult to accept this fact, as the situation Galanadis described was too bizarre.\n\nOscar nodded and said, \"Aunt Yu, hello. I am Oscar. Uncle, let me explain to you. It might be clearer. The situation is like this...\" As he spoke, his eyes met Galanadis', and through the dragon race's unique ability, he slowly transmitted his memories to Galanadis.\n\nAfter a while, Galanadis finally understood what had happened. Kaka's memories showed him everything from Nian Bing capturing Bingyun to using the Divine Descent technique at the cost of his life.\n\nRaising his head, his gaze left Oscar's and fell upon Yu Ruyan, filled with anger. \"You scoundrel, why did you attack Nian Bing without giving him a chance to explain? Do you know what happened? Why didn't you think about why Nian Bing captured Bingyun to this place? He just wanted to find out the whereabouts of his parents! Since childhood, he lost his parents because they were persecuted by the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice. The reason for his achievements today is precisely the motivation generated by hatred. He captured your daughter and brought her to this cave only to find out the true whereabouts of his parents from her, to find out if his parents were dead or alive. Yes, he did have a relationship with your daughter, but do you know the circumstances? It was because your daughter originally wanted to harm him and put an unknown fruit into his food. After they ate it, they realized it was an aphrodisiac. But it was too late, and that's how everything happened. You killed Nian Bing, and I will kill you!\"\n\nSeeing Galanadis raise his hand, Phoenix Girl quickly stepped in front of her mother. Oscar also pulled Galanadis, sighing, \"Uncle, don't do it. Actually, Nian Bing himself wanted to die.\"",

    "content": "Garamendis, enraged, paused slightly and said, \"Kaka, what do you mean? How could Nian Bing seek death himself?\"\n\nOscar sighed and said, \"The fact is as it is. Although it wasn't his true intention, Nian Bing did have that kind of relationship with Bing Yun and held her captive here for ten days. Suddenly learning that Bing Yun was his godmother's daughter, and then seeing Sister Feng, put him in an extremely awkward situation. He didn't know how to face it. Originally, he wouldn't have thought of dying, and was willing to accept any punishment from Aunt Yu Ruyan. But Bing Yun actually took a sword for him, making him feel he could never repay her love. He deeply loves Sister Feng and that girl named Long Ling'er, but after what happened with Bing Yun, and their time together, he knew he couldn't abandon Bing Yun. And Bing Yun fell into a near-death state saving him. To save Bing Yun, he had to use that powerful forbidden spell by cursing his own life. At that moment, if his choice had been even slightly slower, Bing Yun would likely have died. After he used the curse on his life to reshape Bing Yun's heart and open her Heavenly Eye acupoint, the overwhelming guilt he felt towards Sister Feng and the girl Long Ling caused him to unleash all his remaining energy. He used the Angel's Tear and his own life force to reshape their bodies, and helped them retain the seeds for opening their Heavenly Eye acupoints. Although Nian Bing lost his life force, in the moment his consciousness faded, his heart was filled with satisfaction. At least he felt he had atoned. He said that this was all he could do for Sister Feng and them before he died. Therefore, one could say he sought death, and Aunt Yu Ruyan did not force him. Alas, how could he have wanted to die? He still had his parents to rescue and wished to live well. However, Bing Yun's critical condition prompted him to make that decision.\"\n\nNo one understood Nian Bing's feelings at that time better than Oscar. Nian Bing didn't want to die, but in that situation, could he not save Bing Yun? No, absolutely not. Actually, Oscar's judgment was slightly mistaken. After Nian Bing saved Bing Yun, he could no longer control the flow of his life force. The Life Curse, this forbidden magic itself, is extremely evil. If Nian Bing had only used ordinary magic, perhaps there would still have been a chance to forcibly suppress the loss of life force. But he used Light magic, which he was not skilled in, and also invoked a Divine Descent technique. His life force became uncontrollable and could not be recalled. Under these circumstances, he could only output all the energy he possessed to do what he wished. Otherwise, the massive energy that had accumulated would have disappeared along with his life force.\n\nYu Ruyan looked at Nian Bing, whose aura had completely changed, and was about to say something when Feng Nü suddenly knelt before the Fire Dragon King Garamendis. \"Senior Dragon King, I beg you, save Nian Bing. You are the great Dragon King; you must have a way.\" If she had harbored any doubts about her feelings for Nian Bing after learning about what happened between him and Bing Yun, those doubts completely vanished the moment Nian Bing infused the Angel's Tear into her. She could clearly feel Nian Bing's boundless love condensed within the Angel's Tear!\n\nGaramendis's emotions gradually calmed. He sighed and shook his head. \"I cannot lie to you, girl. Get up. I truly have no way. His life force has completely vanished. If his Heavenly Eye acupoint had not evolved to the intermediate stage, even his soul might have disappeared with it. Although his soul consciousness still remains in his Heavenly Eye acupoint, having completely lost his life force, it is almost impossible to save him. You don't need to beg; I will do my best. For now, we can only take him back and try our best with the combined power of us Seven Dragon Kings. Nian Bing, because he carried hatred since childhood, his personality was sometimes eccentric, even a bit cold, but in his heart, he was so kind. Do you remember when he asked me to take you out of the Cold Ridge? Although I don't know how he persuaded you, the real reason was that we, the Seven Dragon Kings, were about to face a calamity. He was afraid you would be harmed, so he asked me to send you away. And he himself, for the first time, used that Life Curse spell, saving us with all his might. The reason Oscar shares a body with him is also because of that incident. If Nian Bing hadn't been lucky, he might have died then. He has greatly benefited our dragon race. As long as we can do it, we will never be stingy with our abilities; we will definitely save him.\" With a wave of his hand, he helped Feng Nü up.\n\nFeng Nü was filled with sorrow. Looking at Nian Bing, who was no longer Nian Bing, she understood the depth of this man's feelings for her even more profoundly. Due to a series of coincidences, it had come to this. She felt a sense of bewilderment, but if she could choose to transfer her life force to Nian Bing now, she would not hesitate for a moment.\n\n\"En.\" Bing Yun, lying on the ground, stirred. The golden wings on her back retracted and then spread again, pushing her body to sit up. Her reaction was almost identical to Feng Nü's. Seeing Oscar standing there, she immediately stood up. \"Nian Bing, are you alright?\" She took a step forward, wanting to examine \"Nian Bing\" herself, but held back by her mother's presence, she stopped in front of \"Nian Bing\" and looked at him carefully, her beautiful eyes filled with complex emotions. \"Why did you have to save me? Are you... are you alright?\"\n\nOscar gave a wry smile. \"Should I call you Sister-in-law Bing Yun? I'm fine, but Brother Nian Bing's situation is dire.\" Seeing the bewildered Bing Yun, he quickly recounted what had happened. Bing Yun had sensed something was wrong when Nian Bing used that Light Divine Descent technique. Having practiced magic since childhood, she knew very well that magic could not be cast beyond one's level. Hearing Oscar's words now, her gaze became vacant. The stillness of death from when Nian Bing had first violated her gradually reappeared, but she did not cry. Turning to Yu Ruyan, she asked, \"Mom, did my master just come? I can feel her presence.\"\n\nYu Ruyan nodded sadly. \"Your master wanted to take you away, but given your current condition, how could I let her? We almost fought later. Fortunately, Senior Fire Dragon King arrived in time and scared your master away. However, judging by her demeanor, she doesn't seem like she'll give up easily.\"\n\nBing Yun sighed. \"My master raised me since I was little and has shown me great kindness. Unfortunately, I can no longer repay her now.\" Turning to Garamendis, she asked, \"Senior, can you take me with you?\"\n\nGaramendis was startled. \"Girl, what are you trying to do?\" Although Bing Yun bore a slight resemblance to Feng Nü, their beauty was entirely different. Feng Nü was as vibrant and captivating as a blooming rose, while Bing Yun was more like a proud winter plum blossom blooming in ice and snow. Compared to them, Long Ling was somewhat inferior in appearance, but her gentleness, like that of a lily, was something that Bing Yun and Feng Nü lacked. The three women each had their own strengths. Garamendis thought to himself, \"What a pity. Nian Bing, if you weren't dead, what incredible fortune this would be!\"\n\nA faint smile appeared on Bing Yun's face, as if the frost on her had melted. \"I am already his person. In the previous sword strike from Mother, Bing Yun died. Now there is only Lan Chen. Lan Chen's life was given by Nian Bing. Her life belongs only to Nian Bing. Whether Nian Bing is alive or dead, throughout her life, Lan Chen will only stay by Nian Bing's side, even if it's just to guard his soul.\" She was not someone who easily expressed her emotions, but once her emotions were stirred, they were like a volcanic eruption, uncontrollable. She no longer cared about Nian Bing's life or death; no matter what happened to Nian Bing, she would stay with him.\n\nYu Ruyan's eyes reddened, and she choked out, \"Chen Chen, it's all my fault. If I hadn't been so impulsive then, it wouldn't have turned out this way. You...\"\n\nLan Chen shook her head. \"No, Mom, how can you blame yourself? If it were any other mother, and their child was bullied, she would have done the same as you. Mom, please forgive your unfilial daughter for not being able to serve you and Dad.\" As she spoke, she knelt before Yu Ruyan and bowed respectfully.\n\nYu Ruyan helped Lan Chen up, tears flowing uncontrollably. \"Chen Chen, Mom understands your feelings. Go, don't worry. Feng Nü, you go with your sister too, so you can look out for each other.\" As she spoke, she pulled Feng Nü, who was beside her, and placed the hands of these two sisters together.\n\nFeng Nü's body trembled. \"Mom, what about you and Dad...\" Although she also wanted to beg her mother like Bing Yun, her sense of responsibility was stronger. She had finally reunited with her parents.\n\nYu Ruyan shook her head. \"You should go pursue your happiness. Although I'm reluctant, Nian Bing can only be loved by you. Go. Over the years, your father and I have lived well without you by our side. Mom only hopes that, regardless of whether Nian Bing can be saved, you will visit often, okay?\"\n\n\"Mom—\" The three mother and daughters hugged each other and wept uncontrollably. Even Lan Chen could no longer suppress the emotions within her.\n\nGaramendis glanced at Oscar and said, \"It seems we can't leave them behind. Since that's the case, we might as well go to Ice Snow City and pick up that girl Ling'er too. That girl's love for Nian Bing is no less than theirs. Perhaps, with them by his side, it will be easier to awaken Nian Bing's consciousness. Their Heavenly Eye acupoints have just opened and haven't entered the initial stage yet. Following me will also allow them to cultivate better.\"\n\nLong Ling had been in a particularly good mood for the past two days because she had received news from Ice Moon City that the Seventh Prince Yan Feng had ascended the throne, while the Fifth Prince Yan Yun had inexplicably died. Her engagement to Yan Yun was naturally resolved. Although she didn't know how Nian Bing had done it, she couldn't help but feel happy at the thought of Nian Bing returning to be with her.\n\nThe sky suddenly turned golden, startling Long Ling. Looking at the sky exuding an aura of peace, she suddenly felt a strong sense of unease. Just as she was wondering what was happening, two rays of light, one gold and one silver, appeared before her in an instant. Long Ling clearly felt a sense of closeness emanating from the light. With a flash of light, the golden light permeated her, transforming into invisible energy that entered her heart and merged with her body. In that instant, her heart was filled with boundless love, and Nian Bing's image appeared clearly in her mind. The next moment, the silver light pierced through her forehead. Before Long Ling could react, she felt a roar in her brain and lost consciousness.\n\nWatching Garamendis, who had transformed into a giant fire dragon, depart with Oscar, Lan Chen, and Feng Nü, Yu Ruyan couldn't help but shed tears again. The family had finally reunited, only to be separated again. As a mother, she found it difficult to suppress her grief. But she knew she could only choose this. Whether for Bing Yun's safety or for the wishes of her daughters, she would not stop Lan Chen and Feng Nü from leaving. Now, she could only pray silently, praying that Nian Bing would be resurrected. Only then could her family truly be reunited.\n\nWhen Garamendis and the others returned to Ice Snow City, Long Ling was still in a coma. Although she had also received the Angel's Tear, her own strength was significantly different from Feng Nü and Bing Yun, so the modification process took much longer. Long Zhi did not know why his daughter had become like this, but he could sense that Long Ling's body was being continuously modified by a pure energy. This could never be a bad thing. Therefore, he simply settled Long Ling in her room and did not use magic to interfere with the energy's progress.\n\nGaramendis brought Oscar, Lan Chen, and Feng Nü back to Qingfeng Studio. As soon as he entered, he saw Xue Jing reprimanding a waiter. The moment Xue Jing saw him return, her eyes lit up with a hint of joy, but she quickly put on a stern face. She strode forward, grabbed Garamendis by the ear, and said crossly, \"You dead fire dragon, you still know how to come back?\"\n\n\"Ouch, it hurts! I say, Jing Jing, can you be gentler? I'm your master, you know! Is this how you show respect for your master? Garamendis cried out repeatedly, but there was no hint of displeasure on his face. Instead, a smile appeared, as if he were accustomed to the situation.",

    "content": "Xue Jing snorted and tightened her grip on his ear, \"You talk about respecting teachers and valuing morality, yet you left suddenly without saying a word. Hmph, in what way were you acting like a teacher?\" As she spoke, her pretty face flushed. Over the past few months, she had been cultivating martial arts under Galemandis, and her strength had greatly increased. Even without using the sword Galemandis had given her, she had reached the level of a martial artist. Even Xue Ji had benefited from his daughter's training; with Galemandis's tens of thousands of years of experience, a few casual pointers were enough to make him learn immensely. However, while Galemandis taught Xue Jing very diligently, he always insisted on teaching her martial arts techniques hand-in-hand, which naturally meant his hands and feet were never idle, always taking some advantage of Xue Jing. For this, he had been disciplined by Xue Jing more than once, but he was happy to have it that way. He even preferred Xue Jing's straightforward personality. As Xue Jing became more familiar with Galemandis, she discovered that this guy named Long Huo was surprisingly knowledgeable. Furthermore, his hidden strength was far beyond anything she had ever imagined. What pleased Xue Jing the most was that Galemandis could tolerate her temper. No matter how she bullied him, he accepted it willingly, never putting on airs as a master. Although she didn't say it aloud, her heart had unknowingly drifted closer to Galemandis.\n\nSeeing the mighty Fire Dragon King, who could even force back a priestess of the Ice Snow Goddess, being pulled by the ear by a human girl without any resistance, Oscar and the other two were stunned for a moment. Oscar was fine; he was connected to Nian Bing's soul and naturally knew some things about Xue Jing and Galemandis. However, Feng Nu and Lan Chen were not aware of this. If the matter of Nian Bing hadn't been weighing on them like a mountain, they would have burst out laughing long ago. After all, Galemandis's current appearance was truly comical.\n\nGalemandis said with a bitter smile, \"Jingjing, can you let me explain? Actually, I haven't been gone for very long! If something hadn't happened to Nian Bing, why would I have left so suddenly?\"\n\nXue Jing glanced at Oscar behind Galemandis. Then she looked at the Feng Nu sisters, whose radiance was even greater than her own. Her anger flared up even more, \"Something happened to him? What could have happened to him? Hmph, what's going on with these two women? I know you don't have the guts, Nian Bing. Good for you! Leaving for only a few months and already having new confidantes. Are you worthy of our sister Ling'er?\"\n\nXue Jing's loud voice drew surprised glances from the customers in the Qingfeng Studio. Galemandis quickly said, \"Things are not as simple as you think. Let go first, and we'll talk in the back.\"\n\nXue Jing snorted and finally released her grip on Galemandis's ear. \"Follow me,\" she said, turning to walk inside. She led everyone to a quiet room.\n\nOscar closed the door, and Xue Jing said, \"Alright, you can talk now. What happened? Nian Bing. You must give me an explanation. Sister Ling'er is too kind-hearted; I can't let you bully her.\"\n\n\"Enough.\" Galemandis's expression turned serious. Instantly, a strong pressure filled the room, causing Xue Jing, who was about to erupt, to quiet down. It was the first time she had seen Galemandis lose his temper. Although she was surprised, she was also a little scared. She muttered, \"Why are you so fierce? Why are you yelling so loudly? It's not like I can't hear you.\"\n\nUpon hearing Xue Jing's words, Galemandis's carefully maintained serious expression almost fell apart. He forced himself to suppress a smile and coughed, \"Jingjing, from now on, I can no longer hide some things from you. Firstly, Nian Bing has indeed had an accident; you could say he is already dead. What you see before you is not Nian Bing himself.\" He then briefly explained the situation between Nian Bing, Feng Nu, and Lan Chen. \"...Therefore, even if Nian Bing can be saved, he probably won't have time to help your Qingfeng Studio participate in the Kitchen God Grand Competition. You need to inform your father.\"\n\nXue Jing stared blankly at Galemandis, \"Nian Bing is dead? You're not lying to me, are you? He, he...\" Although she had been somewhat angry with Nian Bing, she couldn't help but feel a surge of sadness upon hearing of his death.\n\nGalemandis sighed and said, \"Even if you doubt my character, you shouldn't doubt the brotherhood between me and Nian Bing. Do you think I would joke about his life and death? There's also something else I need to tell you, Jingjing. Our master-disciple relationship might be coming to an end. I probably won't be coming back in the future.\"\n\nXue Jing's body trembled, \"What do you mean by that? Will you not come back even after saving Nian Bing? You, you don't want me... this disciple anymore?\" She had grown accustomed to Galemandis's presence and felt a strong sense of loss. She bit her lip, her eyes flashing with a complex light. She suddenly realized that she was becoming unable to leave this man.\n\nGalemandis said with a bitter smile, \"No, it's not that I don't want you; it's probably that you don't want me. Jingjing, there's something I've been hiding from you, and even the name Long Huo is fake. I truly like you. In the past thousand years, you are the only woman who has touched my heart. However, if you knew my true identity, I'm afraid you would find it hard to accept me.\" He revealed a somber look as he spoke.\n\nXue Jing was stunned for a moment and asked curiously, \"What is your identity? Do you think I'm someone who cares about your identity? Even if you were a beggar, as long as I felt, felt good about you, I would still be your disciple! Wait, what did you mean by 'past thousand years'? I don't understand.\"\n\nGalemandis took a deep breath and finally made up his mind, \"Jingjing, the reason I say you won't accept my identity is because I am not human. I am a dragon, a fire dragon.\"\n\nXue Jing's expression was first stunned, and then she burst into loud laughter. Her bell-like laughter made Galemandis feel uneasy. \"Are you kidding me? You're a dragon? Then I'm a phoenix. What trick are you trying to pull now, trying to gain my sympathy so I'll keep you? Hmph, I won't keep you, then. You can leave.\"\n\nGalemandis said somewhat bitterly, \"Jingjing, I'm telling the truth. I'm not lying to you. I can't lie to you at a time like this. Nian Bing is in danger, and we need to leave here immediately.\" As he spoke, he raised his arm. With a flash of red light, his arm instantly became thicker, tearing open his clothes. Covered in a dense layer of red scales, it transformed into a dragon's claw.\n\nXue Jing's smile froze. Looking at Galemandis's serious expression, and then at Feng Nu and the others standing by without any surprise, she exclaimed, \"You, you're really a dragon? But how can you...\"\n\nGalemandis nodded, \"Yes, I am a dragon. Fire Dragon King Galemandis is my true name. Nian Bing also knows this clearly. As the noble Fire Dragon King, I possess strength equivalent to your human Grandmaster. At the same time, under the secret techniques of the dragon race, I can transform into human form. My physical structure is no different from humans. Perhaps it is because of this that I have fallen for you. I know this is sudden and difficult for you to accept, but it is all the truth. Alright, I've said what I needed to say. We have had a master-disciple connection. Jingjing, if I have caused you any trouble over the years, Galemandis apologizes here. We are leaving.\" His heart ached, just as it had when he lost the Light Dragon King Dimantedi. Making this decision was so difficult. If it hadn't been for Nian Bing's sudden accident, he might not have been able to make up his mind. After all, the biggest problem between him and Xue Jing was their different races. Could a dragon and a human truly be together? Galemandis himself was not sure. Better a short pain than a long one. He realized his love for Xue Jing was deepening. If he dragged it out any longer, he didn't know if he would have the courage to tell Xue Jing the truth in the future. Although his heart ached now, he also felt a sense of relief.\n\nWatching Galemandis walk towards the exit, and seeing Oscar and Feng Nu stand up to follow him, Xue Jing suddenly said, \"Wait a moment.\"\n\nGalemandis turned back, his expression now somewhat somber. \"Jingjing, you really need to change your temper. Otherwise, it will be easy for you to suffer losses without me by your side. You must continue practicing the cultivation methods I taught you; they will be of great benefit to you. Whoa, what are you doing?\" As he was speaking with heartache, Xue Jing suddenly flashed in front of him and grabbed his cheek.\n\nA smile appeared in Xue Jing's eyes, \"Are you really a dragon? Transforming into human form and looking exactly like us humans! This is too much fun. Why didn't you say you were the Fire Dragon King earlier? If I had known you were a legendary dragon, perhaps I would have decided to marry you sooner. Hmm, marrying a dragon king, that's a pretty good choice.\" As she spoke, she looked at the dumbfounded Galemandis with a smile in her eyes. Not to mention Galemandis was stunned; even Feng Nu, Lan Chen, and Oscar on the side were startled by the sudden change. None of them expected Xue Jing's reaction to be like this.\n\nAs the pain on his face gradually intensified, Galemandis finally woke up. He didn't care that Xue Jing was pinching his face and, suppressing his immense joy, hesitantly asked, \"Are you serious?\"\n\nXue Jing smiled slightly, \"What? Are you afraid I'll regret it? I've decided. From now on, you're no longer my master. Since you're a Dragon King, you should protect me forever, but...\"\n\nGalemandis's heart, oscillating between pain and excitement, became exceptionally sensitive. Upon hearing Xue Jing's tone change, he immediately became nervous, \"But what?\"\n\nXue Jing said, \"But if you're a dragon, you should be able to fly, right? If you can't fly, I won't acknowledge you as a dragon.\"\n\n\"Fly? Yes, of course, I can. Not to mention transforming back into my dragon form, even in human form, I can still fly! This is easy, too easy. Jingjing, you really don't mind me?\"\n\nXue Jing smiled slightly, \"What? Are you having second thoughts? You don't want me anymore? I'm telling you, smelly dragon, even if you want to give up on me, you can't. Wherever you go, I go.\"\n\n\"Heavens!\" Galemandis made an exaggerated gesture and sighed to the sky, \"Heavens, aren't you toying with me? If I had known Jingjing actually liked me as a dragon, I would have won you over long ago.\"\n\nXue Jing skillfully pinched his ear, \"Alright, let's not waste time. Don't we need to hurry and save Nian Bing? I'll go say hello to my dad and tell him I'm going out with Ling'er for a few days. We'll leave together. Oh, right, don't tell my dad you're a dragon. While I can accept it, it doesn't mean my dad can.\"\n\nGalemandis was overjoyed, \"Yes, my great wife. My great Fire Dragon King Galemandis will be given to you from now on.\"\n\nXue Jing pinched his arm, glared at him, and then ran out of the room. However, she did not object to Galemandis's way of addressing her. In fact, it wasn't Galemandis's Dragon King identity that moved her, but his confession. Even though he was a dragon, Xue Jing, after all that had happened, knew that to get true love, she also had to give it.\n\nAn hour later, Galemandis transformed into a giant dragon again and flew away from Ice Snow City with the group. Two more people left with them: Xue Jing and Long Ling. Long Ling was still unconscious. Galemandis didn't care if Long Zhi agreed or not; he didn't even inform him and left directly with Long Ling. Although there were five people on his back, Galemandis's speed did not decrease at all. Xue Jing sat at the very front, and he deliberately showed off, intentionally increasing his speed to the limit, with a fiery red light shield enveloping everyone, preventing the strong winds from reaching them.\n\nFlying in the sky for the first time, and sitting on the back of her beloved dragon, Xue Jing cheered with excitement. Her presence livened up the atmosphere, and Feng Nu and Bing Yun, who had been silent, also relaxed slightly. With Galemandis's energy-consuming rapid flight, they reached the Cold Ridge, the border between the Ice Moon Empire and the Langmu Empire, in just one day.\n\nFrom afar, Xue Jing saw six clusters of colorful light circling in the sky. As they got closer, she clearly saw that the six colorful lights were actually six giant dragons, just like Galemandis. On their way back, Galemandis had already used the dragon race's communication methods to notify Kajiossi and the others. Judging that they were about to return, the Dragon Kings came out to welcome them.\n\nWith his fiery red dragon wings spread wide, Galemandis instantly slowed his forward momentum and stopped a hundred paces away from the six Dragon Kings. He lowered his dragon head and said, \"I have returned.\"",

    "content": "Caiosiesis let out a roar of dragon with a hint of anger, \"Galamandis, have you forgotten your duty? Nian Bing has been a great benefactor to us dragons. Your duty by his side is to protect him. How could such a thing happen?\"\n\nFacing Caiosiesis's questioning, Galamandis said bitterly, \"This is indeed my fault. I am willing to accept any punishment.\"\n\nDimanteti, standing nearby, smoothed things over, \"We'll talk about punishment later. Saving Nian Bing is the priority. Oh, you've brought quite a few friends. We should introduce ourselves. I am Dimanteti, the Light Dragon King, and Oscar's mother.\" As she spoke, she flicked her dragon tail, nudging the solemn Caiosiesis.\n\nPerhaps only the Light Dragon King could completely disarm the formidable Dark Dragon King. He shook his head helplessly and said, \"I am Caiosiesis, the Dark Dragon King.\"\n\nAs soon as Caiosiesis finished speaking, a solicitous voice rang out, \"Esteemed beautiful ladies, I am the handsome, dashing, elegant, and imposing Space Dragon King Caodiris. I am still unmarried and can transform into a human form exactly like a human. Ah—\" In a yellow-brown light, he was sent flying by a giant dragon wing.\n\nPatting his belly, the largest among the dragon kings, the胖子 (Fatty) seemed as if he had done nothing. \"Phoenix Girl is back! We're old acquaintances. I am Paparukus, the Earth Dragon King.\"\n\nXue Jing chuckled, \"Your voice sounds very familiar! Aren't you that big fatty who came to our Qingfeng Zhai with Galamandis to trick us out of food and drinks back then?\"\n\nFortunately, the Fatty was in his dragon form when he died, so his embarrassment couldn't be seen. He coughed awkwardly, \"Miss Xue Jing remembers very clearly! However, I, Fatty, only ate and drank a lot. Unlike some people, who even stole a young lady's heart.\"\n\nGalamandis retorted impatiently, \"What? I know you're jealous. I, this Dragon King, moved Jingjing with my true heart. Your jealousy is useless. Looking at how fat you are, you'll probably have to wait until your next life to find a wife.\"\n\nGreen dragon scales gleamed. A polite voice sounded, \"Hello everyone, I am Karodiris, the Wind Dragon King.\" Following him closely was a cold voice, \"I am Sazasis, the Ice Dragon King.\" Galamandis chuckled and said, \"The last one is me, Galamandis, the Fire Dragon King.\"\n\nPhoenix Girl knew that Nian Bing's life depended on these seven dragon kings. She quickly bowed respectfully and said, \"Phoenix Girl greets all seniors.\"\n\nLan Chen also nodded to the seven Dragon Kings and said, \"Lan Chen greets all seniors.\"\n\n\"Mom.\" Oscar pointed at Galamandis's back and suddenly jumped up. He shared this human body with Nian Bing and had no ability to fly, but he wasn't worried at all now.\n\nGolden light flashed. Just as Oscar predicted, Dimanteti caught him steadily on her back and said with a smile, \"You! Why are you still so restless?\"\n\nOscar said excitedly, \"Mom, I miss you so much. Are you and Dad okay?\"\n\nA strange light flickered in Caiosiesis's huge dragon eyes. He said in a deep voice, \"Alright, let's go back first. We need to find a way to save Nian Bing.\"\n\nThe Dragon Kings quickly returned to the homes of the Light Dragon King and the Dark Dragon King with their new guests. The Seven Dragon Kings transformed into their human forms. Without any delay, after arranging for Xue Jing, Phoenix Girl, and the unconscious Dragon Spirit, they took Oscar into the inner cave. At the same time, they set up seven powerful restrictions outside to prevent external intrusion.\n\nEntering the inner cave, Caiosiesis stopped and suddenly said coldly, \"Kaka, do you know your crime?\"\n\nOscar was stunned and said, \"Dad, what did I do?\"\n\nDimanteti reprimanded, \"What are you doing! The child has just returned, and you're already scolding him.\"\n\nCaiosiesis's attitude did not change due to his wife's persuasion. His voice suddenly became extremely cold, \"Speak, where did you learn the Dragon God Heart Technique?\" As soon as these words were spoken, not only Dimanteti, the Light Dragon King, but also the other five Dragon Kings' expressions changed drastically. After all, the Dragon God Heart Technique was the supreme dragon art that only the Dragon God could cultivate. According to dragon clan rules, if anyone stole and learned the Dragon God Heart Technique, the consequence would be destruction, specifically the direct destruction of the dragon clan's primal dragon soul.\n\nThe other Dragon Kings might not be able to sense it, but Caiosiesis, as the next Dragon God, had already been cultivating the Dragon God Heart Technique for some time. With his powerful innate strength, he had cultivated the Dragon God Heart Technique to the third level. Although his strength had not changed significantly, he had laid a solid foundation for becoming stronger. When Oscar had leaped onto Dimanteti's back earlier, Caiosiesis had surprisingly sensed the aura of the Dragon God Heart Technique on Oscar. Moreover, his Dragon God Heart Technique was not inferior to his own, having also reached the third level. Caiosiesis, being from the Dark Dragon clan, was not held back by his identity and was chosen to be the next Dragon God. Even if his own son made a mistake, he had to be just.\n\nDimanteti stepped forward and grabbed Oscar. \"Kaka, quickly tell your father you didn't steal the Dragon God Heart Technique, right? You know, that's a capital offense!\"\n\nOscar glanced at his father. Although Caiosiesis's eyes were full of anger, a hint of deep sadness was revealed in the depths of his eyes. He slowly nodded and said, \"Yes, I did learn the Dragon God Heart Technique. However, I learned it accidentally. I only realized it was a secret not to be passed down among dragons when I started cultivating. By then, it was impossible to give up.\" Then, he explained how he had spied on the secrets in the hearts of the Seven Dragon Kings while they were transferring energy, and how he had learned the Dragon God Heart Technique. Indeed, Oscar's Dragon God Heart Technique had also reached the third level. This was not because he had stronger strength than Caiosiesis. The advancement from the first to the second level was due to the opportunity brought by the enhancement of Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye acupoint and the opening of the Violent Middle acupoint. The advancement from the second to the third level was precisely because of the Divine Descent technique Nian Bing used today. Although Oscar's energy was strange, he was, after all, the son of the Light Dragon King and the Dark Dragon King. Both the light and dark energies were his favorites. Under the effect of the massive light element condensed by the Tear of the Angel, his realm had actually improved like that. It was only later that he realized this, as he was immersed in sadness at the time. Now that his father had discovered it, he knew there was no need to hide anything.\n\nThe color drained from Dimanteti's face. No matter how much she loved her son, she dared not influence Caiosiesis's decision at this moment. Her eyes showed a plea as she looked at her husband, but Caiosiesis closed his eyes, not looking at her or Oscar.\n\nWith a thud, Oscar knelt before Caiosiesis. \"As the son of the Light Dragon King and the Dark Dragon King, I am willing to bear all my actions. Father, please punish me.\"\n\nCaiosiesis sighed deeply, \"Good, you are worthy of being my son. Although this was an unintentional mistake, you have violated the clan rules of the dragons. Child, go well.\" As he spoke, he slowly raised his right hand.\n\nDimanteti suddenly rushed in front of Oscar, saying excitedly, \"Are you really going to kill your own son? Then kill me too.\" She couldn't stop her husband, but she was even more unwilling to see her son die! After all her efforts to have Oscar, Oscar lost his physical body at birth, which made Dimanteti dote on her son immensely.\n\nCaiosiesis opened his eyes. His eyes were actually moist. \"Dimanteti, get up. The Dragon God trusts me so much, how can I be partial?\"\n\n\"Hey, hey. Hey, Caiosiesis, don't get it wrong.\" Galamandis, standing nearby, flashed with red light and blocked Caiosiesis.\n\nCaiosiesis was stunned. \"What are you doing? Galamandis, I know you mean well, but I must be just at this moment. The clan rules absolutely cannot be violated.\"\n\nGalamandis chuckled, \"Let me finish first. I'm not trying to stop you. Yes, stealing the Dragon God Heart Technique is a capital offense. I also thought about stealing some back then, but I didn't have the courage. I didn't expect Kaka to accidentally learn it. Not bad, not bad, this young man has a bright future.\"\n\nCaiosiesis said with slight anger, \"Galamandis, stop talking nonsense in front of me.\" Having to personally execute his son was already difficult enough for him.\n\nGalamandis said with a smile, \"Of course, I'm not talking nonsense. Caiosiesis, let me ask you, is stealing the Dragon God Heart Technique a major clan matter?\"\n\nCaiosiesis nodded, \"Of course, it's a grave offense.\"\n\nGalamandis said, \"I know you are impartial, but since this is a major clan matter, you don't seem to have the right to decide. Although my father has already confirmed you as the next Dragon God, you are not yet one, so you cannot exercise the powers of the Dragon God. Kaka's fate should be decided by my father. Moreover, Kaka is currently one with Nian Bing. Our most important task now is to save Nian Bing, who has been a great benefactor to our dragon clan. If you lose even the last glimmer of hope for Nian Bing's revival because you punish your own son, can you bear that responsibility?\"\n\nCaiosiesis hesitated. Galamandis did not directly plead for Kaka, but everything he said hit the key points. \"This, ...\"\n\nGalamandis said seriously, \"Don't hesitate. Whether it's to save Nian Bing or to deal with Kaka, it requires the Dragon God himself to decide. Alright, we can only call upon him again.\"\n\nDimanteti cast a grateful look at Galamandis. Although Kaka's fate was uncertain, at least he wouldn't die immediately. Even Caiosiesis secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He not only did not blame Galamandis for mocking him but also felt grateful in his heart. He nodded and said, \"Alright, let the Dragon God decide everything.\"\n\nOscar retreated to the side. The Seven Dragon Kings changed their positions, forming a circle with Dimanteti, the Light Dragon King, in the center. At the same time, they raised their right hands.\n\nCaiosiesis bit his right middle finger and flicked a drop of blood, simultaneously letting out a clear dragon roar, \"I, Caiosiesis, the Dark Dragon King, with my blood as a guide, dragon power residing in darkness, awaken!\"\n\nGalamandis bit his right middle finger and flicked a drop of blood, \"I, Galamandis, the Fire Dragon King, with my blood as a guide, dragon power residing in flames, awaken!\"\n\nSazasis bit his right middle finger and flicked a drop of blood, \"I, Sazasis, the Ice Dragon King, with my blood as a guide, dragon power residing in ice, awaken!\"\n\nThe Fatty bit his right middle finger and flicked a drop of blood, \"I, Paparukus, the Earth Dragon King, with my blood as a guide, dragon power residing in the earth, awaken!\"\n\nKarodiris bit his right middle finger and flicked a drop of blood, \"I, Karodiris, the Wind Dragon King, with my blood as a guide, dragon power residing in the wind, awaken!\"\n\nCaodiris bit his right middle finger and flicked a drop of blood, \"I, Caodiris, the Space Dragon King, with my blood as a guide, dragon power residing in space, awaken!\"\n\nFinally, Dimanteti bit her right middle finger and flicked a drop of blood, simultaneously letting out a clear dragon roar, \"I, Dimanteti, the Light Dragon King, with my blood as a guide, dragon power residing in light, awaken!\"\n\nAs the incantation was uttered, the clothes made of energy on the Seven Dragon Kings disappeared simultaneously, replaced by dragon scales radiating seven-colored light. The seven-colored light bloomed simultaneously. The seven drops of blood fused at the apex in the air. At this moment, the Seven Dragon Kings were not enhancing their absolute strength but their entire dragon power.\n\nThe seven drops of blood condensed together under the infusion of dragon power. The Seven Dragon Kings shone with the flames of their respective elements. They simultaneously chanted in the dragon language in a low voice. The fused blood in the air gradually changed. Dimanteti let out a long cry, and milky white light instantly covered the blood. The fused blood seemed to begin to grow under the light. The red-covered area expanded, outlining a small red hexagram. The positions of the Seven Dragon Kings changed rapidly. The six surrounding Dragon Kings moved aside, making way for a position. Dimanteti floated out, and the Seven Dragon Kings simultaneously circled the bloody light in the center.",

    "content": "Their chanting gradually grew louder, filled with a solemn aura. The surging dragon power completely sealed the entire cave, and a strange aura drifted up. The holiness of light, the gloom of darkness, the fickleness of space, the steadiness of earth, the whisper of wind, the roar of fire, the sigh of ice – the auras of seven magical elements appeared within the hexagram formed by dragon blood.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings knelt simultaneously, calling out in unison: \"Using my dragon power as a medium, noble Dragon God! Please hear our plea and descend.\" The blood-red hexagram instantly blazed with light. Amidst the surging energy, the hexagram slowly descended. The moment the light touched the ground, a gentle white light rose. This white halo looked like icy mist. Under the effect of the halo, the bodies of the Seven Dragon Kings actually floated up and drifted outwards. The halo’s range quickly expanded to cover every corner within a five-zhang radius. The light gradually faded, and a low, immense pressure began to appear. The pressure didn't reach its limit all at once but deepened gradually. The light shining on the bodies of the Seven Dragon Kings, led by the Dark Dragon King Kagjiosis, became even stronger, resisting this ever-increasing pressure. With the combined might of the Seven Dragon Kings, using their dragon bloodlines as a guide, they had once again awakened the supreme ruler of the dragon race on the Divine Continent – the Dragon God.\n\nA low sigh came from the milky white light. The Dragon God's figure slowly emerged in the reddish-gold light. \"My children, why do you call me again so soon? Is there any news about Morthus's Sealing Bottle?\"\n\nKagjiosis respectfully replied, \"Esteemed Dragon God, we have summoned you only out of desperation. There is still no news of Morthus's Sealing Bottle; we have been waiting for it. However, the human who saved us last time has gotten into trouble again. To help his friend reconstruct his heart, he used that life-cursing magic again, causing his life force to completely drain. Fortunately, his Heavenly Eye acupoint has advanced to the intermediate stage, so he did not die completely and a wisp of his soul remains, preserved within the Heavenly Eye acupoint. We cannot help him revive, so we can only request your assistance.\"\n\nThe Dragon God pondered, \"This is troublesome. That curse is itself an extremely evil magic. After Nien Bing used it last time, it fused with your child's dragon soul by chance, allowing him to escape disaster. However, although dragon life force is powerful, it is still similar to humans. The situation last time was extremely special and cannot be replicated. Moreover, after cursing his life twice in a row, he almost has no chance. This is truly troublesome. Kagjiosis, didn't I instruct you to protect him? How did it end up like this?\"\n\nBefore Kagjiosis could speak, Gallamanthis interjected, \"Esteemed Dragon God, this is my fault. I was supposed to be protecting Nien Bing, but this happened. I cannot escape blame. If I could share my life force to save him, I would not hesitate.\"\n\nThe Dragon God's voice turned serious, \"It's not as simple as you think, Gallamanthis. We'll discuss your punishment later. Where is Nien Bing's body? I need to sense his current condition with my divine sense to see if there's any way.\"\n\nGallamanthis quickly agreed. Before he could speak, Oscar flashed forward and knelt before the Dragon Kings, respectfully saying, \"Oscar pays his respects to the Esteemed Dragon God.\"\n\nThe Dragon God's golden-red figure expanded slightly, and a kind voice sounded, \"You are Kagjiosis and Diamante's child, aren't you? Your energy aura is indeed very special. Eh...\"\n\nKagjiosis knew the Dragon God had sensed it. Although only the Dragon God's divine sense had appeared now, with the Dragon God's immense power, it was impossible not to sense Oscar's aura. Kagjiosis said gravely, \"Esteemed Dragon God, I have another matter to report to you. My child with Diamante, by innate ability, possesses telepathic capabilities. When we jointly helped him evolve, he secretly learned the Dragon God's Heart Technique from me. This is a grave taboo of our race. I request your judgment, Esteemed Dragon God. Kagjiosis has no complaints.\"\n\nThe Dragon God fell into a brief silence. After a long time, he sighed and said, \"Perhaps this is fate. Kagjiosis, I can feel the pain in your heart. You and Diamante went through countless hardships to finally be together, and then you finally had such a child...\"\n\nDark light flickered in Kagjiosis's eyes. He respectfully said, \"No, Esteemed Dragon God. Race rules cannot be broken. As the successor to the next Dragon God, I will absolutely not show favoritism. I request you to handle this justly.\"\n\nThe Dragon God smiled slightly, \"Rules are dead, but we are alive. Indeed, secretly learning the Dragon God's Heart Technique is a grave taboo of our race. However, strictly speaking, your child is not yet a member of our race, and he did it intentionally. Even if punishment is necessary, it should be after he has reshaped his dragon body. If he can pass our race's trials then and become the strongest among the new generation of dragons, he will, after you, become the successor to the Dragon God after the next one. Oscar's energy is very strange. Our dragon race has existed in the world for countless years, and this is the first time we've encountered such a situation. Perhaps, the dragon race will become even stronger under his future leadership. Haven't you noticed that his Dragon God's Heart Technique has reached the third level? With his foundation and strength, this can only be described as a miracle. There are no absolute evils in the world. You don't need to say any more; I will handle this matter.\"\n\nKagjiosis was overjoyed, his voice trembling slightly. He respectfully bowed to the Dragon God's divine sense, \"Thank you, Esteemed Dragon God.\" Oscar quickly followed his father in bowing. He knew that his life was temporarily saved.\n\nAt this moment, the Dragon God's golden-red divine sense magnified, completely enveloping Oscar's body. Oscar's entire body trembled. Under the irresistible, vast energy, his consciousness returned to Nien Bing's heart area. The Dragon God's incredibly powerful divine sense swept through every corner of Nien Bing's body in an instant, finally gathering together and entering the Heavenly Eye acupoint in Nien Bing's mind.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings watched Oscar's body anxiously, especially Diamante, who had just recovered from her grief. She was filled with gratitude towards the Dragon God. With just a casual remark, the Dragon God had absolved her son of his great crime. She prayed silently, now only hoping that Nien Bing could be successfully revived, for she knew very well that if Nien Bing truly died, Oscar, who possessed Nien Bing's body, would never be able to reshape his dragon body.\n\nAs if an eternity had passed, the golden-red light slowly receded from Nien Bing's body. Nien Bing's body slowly slumped to the ground, devoid of all aura, his entire body covered in a layer of ashen gray.\n\nThe Dragon God's somewhat somber voice rang out, \"What a potent curse! Even I cannot help his body regain its life force. It seems there is only one last method left now.\"\n\nKagjiosis asked, \"Esteemed Dragon God, do I need to do anything?\"\n\nThe Dragon God replied, \"Your child Oscar has been taken into my divine sense. With his own abilities, it will be difficult for him to understand the nature of his energy. I will keep him in my divine sense to cultivate for a period of time and guide him in some of our race's abilities. It might be beneficial for him. As for Nien Bing, even I cannot save him. Now, I can only seek help from that senior. This can also be considered our dragon race repaying Nien Bing's kindness. If we can save him, then we will owe him nothing. Kagjiosis, there is a ultimate puppet technique in the Dark Puppet Art called Zombie Art, which can revive the souls of the dead and make them incredibly powerful. Now, you will use this magic on Nien Bing and awaken him.\"\n\nKagjiosis was taken aback and asked in surprise, \"Esteemed Dragon God, are you truly going to use Zombie Art? You must know that once this magic is used, Nien Bing will completely become a member of the undead, and there will likely be no chance of revival. Moreover, after being cast with Zombie Art, although his physical abilities will greatly improve, he will lose all magic, and the Zombie Art can only be sustained for one year. After one year, he will turn to dust and vanish. Perhaps even a true god cannot save him.\" Zombie Art is also a forbidden curse. It can only be successfully cast within an hour of a person's death, and once successful, Nien Bing's body will become a true zombie, with no human abilities, only able to act on zombie instincts, and the final outcome will inevitably be complete annihilation, with even his soul imprint erased. If Zombie Art were used on Nien Bing, it would not be saving him, but rather completely destroying him from this world.\n\nThe Dragon God naturally saw the doubt in Kagjiosis's heart and smiled slightly, \"It's not what you think. Nien Bing's body is already dead now, but his body was modified by the dragon soul, making him greatly different from ordinary humans. Even in the worst-case scenario where his life force cannot be restored, the annihilation after one year from the Zombie Art will not occur to him. Even if he lives in a zombie form, it is still better than truly dying. With Nien Bing's Heavenly Eye acupoint at the intermediate stage, combined with his dragon body, he can become an undead zombie and live forever. Moreover, saving him here on the Yangguang Continent is impossible. Even if I personally go to the Yangguang Continent, I cannot restore his life force. There is only one method left to try, and that is to bring him to the Dragon Continent and ask a senior to treat him. To travel from the Yangguang Continent to the Divine Continent via magical teleportation, Nien Bing must first be alive, otherwise, my divine sense cannot connect with him, and how can I bring him here? Although Zombie Art is evil, it is not uncrackable. Once he arrives on the Dragon Continent, I will find a way. If that senior is willing to save him, there is at least a fifty percent chance of him returning to his original state, and he might even gain some small benefits.\"\n\nKagjiosis finally breathed a sigh of relief, as he knew that Oscar's soul and dragon soul were already combined with Nien Bing's body, and he shared Diamante's concerns. \"Alright, please wait a moment, Esteemed Dragon God. I will now cast Zombie Art to restore Nien Bing's consciousness.\" As soon as he finished speaking, the other six Dragon Kings retreated. Six-colored light condensed in the air to form a barrier, enclosing Kagjiosis and the Dragon God's divine sense. Although Zombie Art was not a divine descent-level magic, it was still a tenth-tier dark magic with a wide radiation range. If it leaked out, the creatures in this cold mountain range would suffer.\n\n\"Eternal darkness that exists in the world! I call upon your boundless energy with the dragon soul, bringing endless darkness to the deceased creature before me. May death fill the world, and vengeful souls fill the earth.\" His voice gradually grew louder, transforming from human language into the dragon race's unique dragon language incantations. Streams of black airflow gradually turned dark red and floated out from Kagjiosis's right hand, which was covered in dark dragon scales. They transformed into dark threads that drilled into Nien Bing's seven orifices. This was not nourishment, but erosion. Darkness, bit by bit, eroded Nien Bing's lifeless body, causing his body to tremble. With each tremor, a mist of blood emanated from his pores. Zombies needed others' blood to maintain their abilities but did not require blood themselves.\n\n\"Rise.\" Kagjiosis shouted lowly. Nien Bing's body straightened up. Under the constant erosion of dark energy, his body began to change. His originally smooth and lustrous skin turned gray, filled with the aura of death. Three-inch-long, dark red fingernails grew on his fingers. A head of gray hair drifted backward, gradually turning dark red. His bones crackled. Under the immense dark energy, a layer of gray scales covered the surface of his skin. At this moment, the Heavenly Eye on Nien Bing's forehead opened without warning. Seven-colored light instantly erupted, forcefully colliding with Kagjiosis's dark energy. Kagjiosis grunted and spat out a mouthful of blood. He was surprised to find that Nien Bing's Heavenly Eye still had the ability to protect its master at this time.\n\nThe dark red evil aura was tinged with a faint golden light. The seven-colored light emanating from the Heavenly Eye acupoint was forcibly suppressed by the dark energy infused with the Dragon God's Heart Technique. Nien Bing's body, under the powerful Zombie Art, finally completed its final transformation. His closed eyes slowly opened. His clear blue eyes had turned a murky dark red, filled with the stillness of death.\n\n\"The end of darkness, return the soul to evil, awaken, King of Zombies.\" The dark red airflow from Kagjiosis struck Nien Bing's chest like a sledgehammer. A circle of golden halo radiated from Nien Bing's chest. The scales that had covered his body melted into his body, once again turning into grayish-white skin, leaving only a faint golden light below his chest.\n\nSeeing this, the Dragon God's divine sense let out a soft \"Oh,\" and muttered to himself, \"He has actually opened the Li Zhong acupoint. It seems Nien Bing's innate talent is indeed astonishing.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing's turbid, dark red eyes lit up, his body shuddered violently, and then gradually calmed down. His dark red eyes gained a bit more spirit. For him, waking up after entering death had only taken a mere instant. Looking at the Dark Dragon King Kashiotoss before him, he couldn't help but ask in surprise, \"I'm actually not dead?\"\n\nCasting zombie magic was not a burden for Kashiotoss; after all, he was the strongest among the Seven Dragon Kings, the Dark Dragon King. However, there were two ways to cast zombie magic. The common method was for the caster to completely control the zombie and use it for their own purposes. This was the more conventional method of zombie magic. The other method was to directly restore the zombie's soul, including its memories. Although this method consumed the same amount of dark energy, it required more than five times the mental energy. Kashiotoss naturally chose the second method, which was why he called Nian Bing the King of Zombies. At this moment, after casting this magic, his face appeared a little pale, clearly the result of excessive mental energy depletion. He sighed lightly and said to Nian Bing, \"Although you are not dead yet, you are close.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned and then noticed his own changes. He could clearly feel his body filled with power, a power stronger than before. However, Oscar's soul seemed to have vanished, and he himself no longer possessed any life aura. All his bodily functions had completely stopped; his heart no longer beat, and his meridians and internal organs had fallen into complete stagnation. The strong aura of death filled him with hostility. If it weren't for his immense mental power, he might have already been unable to resist the urge to kill. The only thing Nian Bing felt good about was that the human-shaped entity condensed from mental power in his Heavenly Eye acupoint was still there. However, it had now turned seven-colored, emitting a faint seven-colored radiance, making his mental power seem to have become even stronger than before.\n\n\"Wh-what's wrong with me?\" Nian Bing said, somewhat lost.\n\nGalamantis said with annoyance, \"Still asking what's wrong? You're too reckless, using the Life Curse again. Don't you know the consequences of doing that to yourself?\"\n\nNian Bing sighed. \"Big brother, I didn't want to do this either, but given the situation at the time, I had no choice. If I hadn't used the Divine Descent technique of the Light element, Bingyun would have been finished. Ah! Right, where is Bingyun? And Feng Nu and my godmother? How are they?\"\n\nGalamantis replied, \"They are all fine. Nian Bing, quickly pay our Dragon Clan's patriarch, the Dragon God, a visit.\" As he spoke, he winked at Nian Bing.\n\nOnly then did Nian Bing notice the golden-red light filled with majestic aura beside him. He quickly bowed respectfully and said, \"Nian Bing pays his respects to the Dragon God. It must have been you who saved me.\"\n\nA gentle energy lifted Nian Bing's body. \"You don't need to thank me. Galamantis is right; you are simply too unruly. You haven't successfully revived yet. You've only regained consciousness within Kashiotoss's zombie magic. However, you are no longer human. If you cannot regain your vitality, then you will forever remain a zombie.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. Because he was now in a zombie state, his smile appeared a bit sinister. \"Being able to regain consciousness is already fortunate for me. Zombie or not, at least this way I still have a chance to see my parents. It's much better than truly dying.\"\n\nKashiotoss frowned. \"You certainly have a positive outlook, but how could we let you become like this? The Dragon God has already decided to take you to the Divine Continent for treatment. There, you might have a chance to truly return to your original state.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes flashed with red light, and he said excitedly, \"I-I can still return to my original state? I...\"\n\nThe Dragon God sighed deeply. \"There is nothing impossible in the world, but to regain your vitality and become human again is not that simple. You will face countless difficult trials. All I can offer you is an opportunity. Whether you can seize the opportunity depends on you.\"\n\nThe Dragon God's voice became much gentler. \"Good child, your noble sentiment of sacrificing yourself to fulfill others is rarely seen among humans. You have shown great kindness to our Dragon Clan, and I will do my utmost to save you. My divine sense spans across the continent, and I cannot maintain it for too long. Your friends seem to be outside. Go say goodbye to them. I will wait for you here. This journey will take an immeasurable amount of time.\"\n\nNian Bing was slightly taken aback and turned to look at Galamantis. Galamantis nodded at him and said, \"Feng Nu, Bingyun, and Long Ling are all outside. Go see them. Alas—\"\n\nLong Ling had woken up when the Seven Dragon Kings had just entered the cave. When she found herself in a strange place, she was startled. Her body, modified by the Tears of the Angel, felt exceptionally comfortable. Her skin became even more radiant, and her long purple hair hung down like fine threads of crystal. Her beautiful eyes became exceptionally clear. She could clearly feel countless magic elements dancing around her. \"Ah! Where am I?\" Long Ling slowly sat up. The world around her became so clear that she could even see dust floating in the gentle breeze. A strange sensation spread throughout her body.\n\n\"We are in the Cold Ridge, Ling'er.\" Xue Jing helped Long Ling stand up. Seeing her, Long Ling felt a sense of peace. She and Xue Jing had been good friends since childhood. Next, she saw Feng Nu with blue hair and Lan Chen with long, dark green hair. Before she could ask, Feng Nu had already explained everything that had happened to her.\n\nCompared to Feng Nu and Bingyun, Long Ling was clearly much more fragile. When she learned that her current transformation was due to Nian Bing sacrificing his life to summon the Tears of the Angel, she was already trembling all over as she cried. If not for Xue Jing's support, she would have already fallen to the ground. Long Ling's limbs were cold, and her large eyes were filled with sadness. She could never have imagined that just as the future she had longed for was about to be realized, such a change would occur. Nian Bing, Nian Bing, are you really dead? Do you not want Ling'er anymore?\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Lan Chen said dejectedly. \"It's all because of me that Nian Bing ended up like this.\"\n\nLong Ling shook her head, sobbing, \"Although I haven't been with Nian Bing for very long, I can feel the burning heart hidden beneath his cold exterior. He must truly love you. Towards his enemies, he can be crueler than anyone. But towards his friends and loved ones, he is kinder than anyone. Even if he had to choose again, he would do this. How can you be blamed? Sister, thank you for bringing me here. Father's wish has been fulfilled. I want to guard by Nian Bing's side like you. Whether he's alive or dead, can I?\"\n\nFeng Nu gently embraced Long Ling and stroked her long purple hair. \"Ling'er, don't cry. Since he is our only one, let's wait for him together. I believe he wouldn't bear to die, even for us. Right?\"\n\n\"Right. For my beloved wives, how could I bear to die?\" Nian Bing's voice rang out, and a gray figure filled with the aura of death slowly emerged from the cave.\n\nAs soon as Lan Chen sensed the aura of death, she instinctively gathered her magic power. However, when she saw Nian Bing with a smile on his face, her expression froze. Nian Bing was wearing a golden magic robe temporarily draped over him. Although his complexion had changed again, the color of his skin had also changed, and even his aura was no longer as sunny as before. But in his red eyes, the three women saw expressions they were all too familiar with.\n\n\"Nian Bing.\" Lan Chen's outer coldness almost instantly disintegrated, and she rushed towards Nian Bing at the fastest speed she could manage. However, she rushed into empty space. With a flash of gray light, Nian Bing instantly moved three feet sideways, evading Lan Chen's embrace. Lan Chen stumbled, and if her Ice Phoenix Wings had not awakened, she would have fallen.\n\nFeng Nu and Long Ling also saw Nian Bing. Long Ling's crying stopped, and Feng Nu's gaze became dazed. In their eyes, although Nian Bing's appearance had changed, their hearts all trembled.\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Don't touch me. I have a strong corpse poison on me. It would be troublesome if it infected you.\" How he wished he could embrace his beloved three women! But he couldn't now. Before leaving the cave, Kashiotoss had warned him that because he had become a zombie, and the most powerful King of Zombies, his body's surface was filled with toxins. When he reached the cave entrance, he didn't come out immediately. Facing the three women, he still hesitated. However, when he saw Long Ling's sad crying face and heard Feng Nu's and Lan Chen's voices, he could no longer suppress his emotions. He deliberately tried to appear relaxed. He wanted his women to be happy, not to cry sadly.\n\n\"Corpse poison? Nian Bing, what's wrong with you?\" Feng Nu asked urgently. The gazes of the three women, six pairs of eyes, were all focused on him like burning flames.\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"It's nothing much. Because I lost my vitality, Kashiotoss helped me revive using zombie magic. I am no longer human, but a zombie.\" As he spoke, he raised his hands and revealed his dark red fingernails to the three women.\n\nLan Chen bit her lower lip and said, \"Nian Bing, whether you are human or a zombie, I will stay by your side. Do you want me?\"\n\nFeng Nu smiled slightly, pulling Long Ling to stand before Nian Bing. \"Whether he wants us or not, we won't leave him, will we?\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes revealed intense emotion, and the hostility in his dark red eyes vanished. \"Feng Nu, Ling'er, you don't blame me?\"\n\nFeng Nu said gently, \"You became like this to save Chen Chen, so how could we blame you? Your Tears of the Angel have told us everything. Your feelings have never betrayed us.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at his hands, feeling the strong aura of death on his body, and said with a bitter smile, \"But with my current state, can I still bring you happiness?\"\n\nLong Ling's eyes showed a gentle light. \"Happiness is a feeling. Everyone perceives happiness differently. For me, as long as you are by my side, that is happiness.\"\n\nThe three women exchanged glances, and there were no more barriers in their hearts. Six almost identical gazes fell upon Nian Bing. Nian Bing roared up to the sky, and the death aura surged throughout his body.\n\nThe ground cracked around him under the influence of the death aura. \"Good, good, for your happiness, no matter how difficult it may be, I will definitely return to my original self, Nian Bing. Wait for me, I will return.\" With that, he didn't linger any longer. He pushed off the ground and returned to the cave like lightning.\n\nAs the three women were about to chase after him, Galamantis, who had come out with Nian Bing, stopped them. \"Let him go. To truly resurrect, he must go to another place. For your future, you can only wait now. This time may be very long, but Nian Bing has made a promise to you. Believe him.\"\n\nWaiting was painful, but the three women nodded without hesitation. They didn't even ask how long this wait would be. At this moment, all they had in their hearts was Nian Bing's promise.\n\nGalamantis smiled slightly. \"Nian Bing is like a cockroach. As long as his will is still there, miracles can happen at any time. Since you are going to wait for him, you should stay here first. Your Heavenly Eye acupoints have just been opened, and you will need a long period of cultivation to enhance your own power. Perhaps, cultivation is the best way to make time pass quicker.\"\n\nLan Chen nodded and said, \"We'll stay here and wait for him. Sister, I think we should do something for Nian Bing.\"\n\nFeng Nu, although she had just reunited with Lan Chen, immediately understood the meaning behind her words. \"Chen Chen, can you face it? She is, after all, your master.\"\n\nLan Chen's eyes showed a hazy gaze. \"When I left that cave, I already said that Bingyun is dead. The one alive now is Lan Chen, and Lan Chen's life has half of Nian Bing in it.\"\n\nLong Ling asked, \"Big sisters, what are you talking about? I don't understand.\"\n\nFeng Nu lowered her voice and whispered something in Long Ling's ear. After listening to her, Long Ling's eyes showed an unprecedented determination. \"Then I will go too. This is something we should do together.\"\n\nFeng Nu took Lan Chen's and Long Ling's hands separately and said, \"Perhaps, we can help him fulfill this greatest wish before he returns. For his wish, we must also work hard.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing returned to the cave with a stirred heart. The Dragon God's golden-red divine consciousness had become more condensed than before, and the Spatial Dragon King, Kaodi Gusi, stood beneath the Dragon God's divine consciousness and nodded at Nian Bing. The Dragon God's voice rang out, \"Nian Bing, you must be prepared. One of the most important reasons I had Kajoexis turn you into a zombie was the extreme pain of long-term spatial travel. Although you now possess a body formed by the fusion of a dragon and a zombie, you will still suffer immense impact. That pain will not only affect your body but also your spirit and soul.\"\n\nNian Bing showed no worry and said calmly, \"No matter what kind of pain it is, I can bear it. I am already a dead person; any pain might be a comfort to me.\"\n\nThe Dragon God said, \"Very well, prepare yourself. Kaodi Xaisi, lend Nian Bing a hand and open the spatial gate. I will use my divine consciousness as a guide to take him to another world.\"\n\nKaodi Xaisi's eyes were no longer playful, but extremely serious. He drew a silver hexagram in the air, which appeared beneath his feet. \"In the name of the Spatial Dragon King, elemental spirits of space, heed my call! Time freezes within space, space travels through time, open, Gate of Infinite Spatial Positioning!\" The silver scales on his body instantly expanded by a circle, and divine light shot from his eyes. The other Dragon Kings retreated far away, and the other magical elements in the cave were driven away by the intense spatial fluctuations. Centered on Kaodi Gusi, an area of five zhang* became a silver ocean. Low dragon roars echoed within the silver ocean, and the spatial elements, following the rhythmic sounds, converged in one direction.\n\nKaodi Gusi's eyes turned completely silver, and a circle of silver flames rose around his body. Clearly, he had pushed his dragon power to the limit. A silver horn grew from his head, and with a slight bow, he injected a stream of white airflow into the silver ocean. The moment this airflow appeared, the silver ocean began to churn violently, its light flashing continuously. All the silver light converged into a rectangular space, two meters high and one meter wide. Within the silver space, halos spun, and Kaodi Gusi exhaled with relief.\n\nThe Dragon God's deep and magnetic voice sounded, \"Kaodi Gusi, your progress has been considerable during this time. Continue to strive to live up to your title as the Spatial Dragon King. Nian Bing, follow me.\" The golden-red light suddenly condensed into a single point and floated into the silver gate. It was not difficult for the Dragon God's divine consciousness to return to the Divine Continent, but for Nian Bing to travel through space with his physical body, his guidance was essential. The golden-red light flashed in the silver gate and disappeared, causing only a slight ripple in the silver vortex within the gate, which quickly returned to normal.\n\nNian Bing cast a deep look at the surrounding Dragon Kings and bowed respectfully to them, saying, \"Please take care of them for me.\" With these words, he stepped through the gate of time and space with firm strides. Crossing two continents and passing through the seal surrounding the Divine Continent, this spatial magic had reached the level of a Divine Descent Spell. The moment Nian Bing disappeared, Kaodi Gusi immediately closed the gate and sat down on the ground, breathing heavily.\n\nDimantetti asked Kajoexis with concern, \"Will he return alive? Kaka...\"\n\nKajoexis raised his hand to stop her. \"Don't worry. With the Dragon God here, even if Nian Bing cannot regain his life, he will return as an undead zombie. Kaka, under the Dragon God's tutelage, will only become stronger. The Dragon God forgives Kaka for such a grave offense. The kindness the Dragon God has shown our couple is immeasurable.\"\n\nDimantetti snorted. \"It's a good thing you're not the Dragon God, or Kaka's life would be lost. I actually hope Gallamantis inherits the position of Dragon God.\"\n\nSeeing his wife angry, Kajoexis shook his head helplessly, embraced Dimantetti's slender waist, wanting to say something but unable to speak. Kaodi Gusi got up from the ground and grumbled, \"I can't see, I can't hear, but! Beautiful Dimantetti, if I were you, I wouldn't be able to stand it.\" Before Kajoexis could get angry, he had already vanished with a flash. He had finally found an opportunity to provoke Kajoexis, so how could he let it go?\n\nThe Ice Dragon King, Earth Dragon King, and Wind Dragon King walked out simultaneously, leaving the space to the couple.\n\n\"Don't be angry. You know, I had to do it that way. Otherwise, how can I ascend to the position of Dragon God in the future?\" Kajoexis's voice softened considerably, lacking the majesty he displayed in front of the other Dragon Kings.\n\nDimantetti gave him a deep look and sighed. \"I know your temper. I'm not really blaming you for anything; I understand your responsibilities. But Kaje, in my long life, you and Kaka are the most important to me. Although we are kings of the dragon race, we are also Kaka's parents. Don't be too strict with the child. If Kaka dies one day, I think I will follow him to another world to take care of him.\" Her voice was calm but filled with unquestionable determination.\n\nKajoexis's body trembled. He looked at his wife and sighed, \"If that day ever comes, whether I succeed the Dragon God's position or not, I will go with you. Similarly, the most important people in my life are only you and Kaka. Dimant, you must understand that uncarved jade cannot become a useful tool. Being strict with Kaka will benefit him when he grows up.\"\n\nDimantetti looked up and met her husband's gaze. Kajoexis's eyes were full of tenderness. At this moment, he was merely her husband, not the Dark Dragon King, nor the heir to the Dragon God.\n\nThe moment Nian Bing stepped into the spatial gate, he immediately felt the world around him change. Although he had used spatial teleportation before, this was his first time experiencing such a scene. The surrounding space became completely distorted, and silver light surged like waves. His body drifted like a small boat in this boundless spatial element, his spiritual power vibrating violently during the spatial transmission, causing needle-like pain that continuously stimulated his nerves. The greatest benefit of becoming a zombie was not feeling physical pain, but Nian Bing clearly saw fine ripples appear on his deathly pale skin. The death energy within his body surged madly, and his body felt as if it might explode at any moment.\n\n\"Calm your mind and use your spiritual power to protect your body, otherwise, you will be torn apart by the fluctuations in this spatial transmission,\" the Dragon God's deep voice echoed in Nian Bing's spiritual world. Nian Bing's heart trembled, and he quickly followed the Dragon God's instructions, condensing his spiritual power within his Heavenly Eye acupoint and releasing a layer of mental energy to envelop his body. He was surprised to find that his spiritual power had transformed into a seven-colored light, similar to the Heavenly Eye domain. However, it was not the energy of the Heavenly Eye domain, as it lacked the aura of the seven magical elements. Yet, his spiritual power seemed to have become more refined.\n\nThe ripples on his body disappeared with the protection of his spiritual power, and the sinister death energy within him also ceased to fluctuate. However, although his body had calmed down, his spiritual power, due to the distraction, had been violently impacted. The fragmented and vast energy of the spatial elements continuously tore at his spiritual power and his soul.\n\nA red light then wrapped around Nian Bing's body. Nian Bing did not resist, as his body had been completely restrained within the silver spatial ocean, and he was unable to resist even if he wanted to. Under the guidance of the red light, his body, constantly shifting position due to the spatial energy, finally stabilized. It was clear that it was the Dragon God guiding him to the correct direction. However, it was only the Dragon God's divine consciousness, not his true form. Nian Bing thought that the Dragon God's divine consciousness was merely guiding his direction, but the increasingly intense pain in his mind caused his Heavenly Eye acupoint to spasm, and even the small figure formed by his spiritual power trembled within the Heavenly Eye acupoint, as if it might collapse at any moment.\n\nNian Bing endured the intense pain with his tenacious willpower, but the pain continued to increase. A voice in his mind seemed to whisper, \"Just pass out, and all this pain will be gone.\" However, Nian Bing vaguely understood that he absolutely could not faint, otherwise, he would lose his spiritual connection with the Dragon God and might be plunged into eternal damnation.\n\nThe soul-piercing pain grew stronger. The seven-colored energy figure in Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye acupoint continuously changed colors, its trembling gradually weakening. His spiritual power, under the assault of the space-tearing energy, gradually dissipated, approaching collapse. The Dragon God's divine consciousness merely kept reminding Nian Bing to persevere, without offering any assistance.\n\nThe intense pain felt as if Nian Bing had fallen into hell. His spiritual power fluctuated between extreme cold and heat. When cold, it was as if he were surrounded by ice; when hot, it was as if he were in lava. The alternating cold and heat, combined with the violent pain, would have driven an ordinary person to collapse from such intense mental stimulation. It must be remembered that Nian Bing had lost his magical power and could not use magic to protect his body. Therefore, his direct contact with the spatial energy was entirely through his spiritual power, and under these circumstances, the pressure on his spiritual power had reached its maximum.\n\nThe Dragon God was also very surprised at this moment. Although he knew that Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye acupoint had reached the intermediate stage, he did not expect Nian Bing's spiritual power to be so powerful. It must be understood that this was not an ordinary spatial teleportation array. To pass through the exceptionally powerful seal of the Divine Continent, the spatial teleportation had to be carried out in a special manner. This method of transmission was something Kaodi Gusi himself could not achieve. The Rank Twelve Divine Descent Spell array he used was merely a catalyst; the true energy was controlled by the Dragon God's divine consciousness, and only then could Nian Bing be teleported to the Divine Continent.\n\nBecause of this, the teleportation magic array was no longer a simple Divine Descent Spell, but a powerful Rank Fourteen spatial magic. Only a top-tier master like the Dragon God could accomplish it. Using Rank Fourteen magic also severely depleted the Dragon God's divine consciousness, which was why Kaodi Gusi's assistance was necessary. In this spatial magic array, everything was controlled by the Dragon God.\n\nThe Dragon God naturally understood the immense pressure ordinary humans would endure in this magic. He had deliberately informed Nian Bing of the pain during spatial transmission beforehand and then had him protect his body with his spiritual power during the transmission, all to help Nian Bing train his spiritual power. For the strong, the more refined their spiritual power, the greater their strength. In the later stages of cultivation, the improvement of spiritual power even became more important than the improvement of physical strength. Training spiritual power within such a Rank Fourteen Grand Forbidden Spell was undoubtedly the best choice. The longer he persevered, the more comprehensively his spiritual power would be baptized by the spatial energy, which would greatly benefit his future spiritual cultivation. Nian Bing had lost his vitality and possessed no physical abilities other than the death abilities of a zombie. To make it easier for him to find himself upon the revival of his life, the Dragon God had made this decision. His divine consciousness was locked onto Nian Bing, ready to rescue him when he could no longer bear it. However, he was astonished to find that Nian Bing's spiritual power was still holding on, showing no signs of true collapse, even though a Dragon King would have been unable to withstand such immense spatial tearing at this point. This made the Dragon God look at Nian Bing with new respect, thinking that human potential was indeed infinite.\n\nThe intense pain had made it difficult for Nian Bing to think, but at this moment, his body also began to change. Although the zombie physique was tough, the mental stimulation was from the inside out. As his spiritual power weakened, it could no longer completely resist the invasion of the spatial tearing. The ripples on his skin reappeared, and a trace of invading spatial energy mixed with the death energy within his body fluctuated. As the intensity of the spatial tearing increased, Nian Bing's body also trembled with its tearing. The spatial tearing spread to every corner of Nian Bing's body, until finally, it entered Nian Bing's finger.\n\nThe Space Ring, originally a magical item based on spatial magic elements, was the foundation. When the spatial energy that had invaded Nian Bing's body entered his Space Ring, Nian Bing's spiritual power, which was already close to collapse, trembled violently. He clearly felt that his Space Ring was on the verge of collapse.",

    "content": "In his shock, his spiritual power actually cleared up a bit. The solidified spiritual body in his Heavenly Eye Acupoint also shone brighter. He absolutely could not let the spatial ring collapse, because it stored his seven most important magic blades! Without magic power, Nian Bing's spiritual power could still enter the spatial ring. Relying on his spiritual power, he constructed a solid barrier within the spatial ring to block the invasion of spatial energy. Just then, a peculiar feeling arose in Nian Bing's heart, because he felt a familiar energy within the spatial ring, an energy that filled him with joy.\n\nNian Bing's spiritual power was already at its limit. To also divide his strength to save the spatial ring pushed him to the brink of collapse. The Dragon God's divine sense was constantly monitoring his condition. Seeing that his spiritual power was about to collapse, he immediately prepared to shield Nian Bing's body with his own divine sense. Just at this moment, a dazzling silver light appeared in Nian Bing's left hand. The strangely shaped hexagonal blade emitted a radiant glow. Nian Bing's eyes shone with silver light, and a figure exactly like him merged with him. A layer of silver radiance completely protected him, not resisting the spatial energy fluctuations around him. Instead, it carried his body and merged with the surrounding spatial energy fluctuations, as if it had also transformed into a mass of spatial energy, no longer subject to the invasion of the surrounding spatial energy.\n\nThe Dragon God in the shadows was completely stunned. After a long while, he began to observe the blade in Nian Bing's hand. The silver blade and the peculiar silver gemstone emitted rings of light, seemingly transcending the surrounding space. What was this? He didn't know, but Nian Bing's heart was filled with excitement. In his hand, he held the Xuan Ji Blade, the sixth of the Hundred Transformations of Divine Skill—\n\nNian Bing greatly sighed in relief. When his consciousness entered the spatial ring, he immediately felt the strong fluctuations of the Xuan Ji Blade. Under that fluctuation, he immediately thought of the surrounding spatial energy. Before collapsing, he raised his spiritual power to its limit, barely creating a small space for himself, and forcefully retrieved the Xuan Ji Blade from within the spatial ring with his spiritual power, holding it in his hand. In that instant, he clearly felt the appearance of the spatial shadow puppet formed by his innate Qi.\n\nAlthough he no longer had magic, these shadow puppets were all controlled by his spiritual power. He easily merged with the spatial shadow puppets.\n\nOne spatial shadow puppet was naturally not enough for Nian Bing to escape his predicament. However, after merging with the spatial shadow puppet, Nian Bing gained the ability to command the spatial divine blade, the Xuan Ji Blade. The Xuan Ji Blade, as a top-tier spatial divine blade, as soon as it appeared within the range of this space, Nian Bing clearly felt the spatial magic elements that had been invading his body madly surging towards the silver gemstone on the Xuan Ji Blade. His entire body felt light, and his spiritual power, which was about to collapse, immediately recovered to normal. Comfort spread throughout his body, and at the same time, the release of his spiritual power brought him a feeling of near collapse.\n\nPanting heavily, his solidified spiritual power quickly recovered in its weakest state. The Xuan Ji Blade released a circle of silver light on its own as the surrounding spatial magic elements were injected, enveloping Nian Bing and preventing him from bearing the surrounding pressure any longer.\n\n\"En, what a spatial divine blade. It is rare to find a divine blade that can be used as a spatial traveler. This blade looks somewhat familiar to me. Where did you get it?\" The Dragon God's voice echoed in Nian Bing's consciousness once more.\n\nNian Bing found that his spiritual power was recovering very quickly. In just this moment, the spiritual body in his Heavenly Eye Acupoint, which was on the verge of collapse, had stabilized. All the newly appeared cracks had completely disappeared, and the feeling of weakness was gradually diminishing.\n\nNian Bing said, \"This Xuan Ji Blade was given to me by my elder brother, Galamantis. Because I cultivate all elemental magic, I can only achieve it in a mimetic form. At that time, my magic power was insufficient, and my spiritual power could not control the laws between the various elements, so I could only rely on these top-tier magic divine blades to achieve it.\"\n\n\"No wonder it looked so familiar to me. So he gave it to you. It really is the Xuan Ji Blade! The origin of this Xuan Ji Blade is very mysterious. It is an item that originally belonged to the Divine Continent. Legend has it that it was forged by a God-King from a generation even earlier than mine. It is said that after this blade was successfully forged, a catastrophe occurred, even involving that God-King. Later, by chance, it fell into the hands of my Dragon Clan. I never expected it to eventually belong to you. Nian Bing, how long do you think this spatial journey of ours has taken?\"\n\nNian Bing pondered for a moment and said, \"About ten hours or more?\"\n\nThe Dragon God said, \"You are wrong. In reality, only three breaths of time have passed.\"\n\nNian Bing exclaimed, \"What? That's impossible! How could I feel like so much time has passed? Oh, I understand. It must be because of this transmission space. Time is still distorted in this space, so it cannot be judged by normal standards.\"\n\nThe Dragon God praised him, \"Yes, you are very smart. You understood the problem so quickly. It is precisely because of the distortion of time that time in this space passes much slower than in the outside world. Staying here for a hundred days would only be a few hours in the outside world. We will still be staying in this space for a long time. If measured by external time, it will take about sixty more days. I hope you can cultivate diligently during these sixty days and try not to rely on the help of the Xuan Ji Blade.\"\n\n\"Cultivate? You mean for me to cultivate spiritual power?\" Nian Bing asked with some doubt.\n\nThe Dragon God smiled faintly, \"It is very convenient to talk to you. Yes, I want you to cultivate spiritual power. With your current level of spiritual power, let alone in the Yangguang Continent, even if you go to the Divine Continent, with your mid-stage Heavenly Eye Acupoint, few people can be stronger than you. There is one thing you must understand: if you want to become stronger than others, you need to have the strongest point. Just like the Imperial Acupoint that you humans can possess, your strongest point now is undoubtedly spiritual power. If you can cultivate your spiritual power to a new level, then it will be of great benefit to your future cultivation and your strength.\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment and said, \"I understand what you mean. You mean that in this space, because my spiritual power is easily consumed significantly to resist the invasion of external energy, it can serve as excellent training, constantly strengthening under pressure.\"\n\n\"Exactly, pressure is the best motivator. Furthermore, in this level fourteen advanced spatial transmission magic, not only will your spiritual power improve, but it will also become more refined. There is something I need to tell you now: even if you go to the Divine Continent, I am not confident that I can truly resurrect you, because you will face a test that even I cannot predict. Only by passing the test can you possibly get help from that senior. And in your current situation, **although you have become very strong after merging with the Dragon Soul and being strengthened by zombie techniques, the abilities you can use are very few. Especially since you did not cultivate martial arts before, this makes it even more difficult. Therefore, you must have the ability to protect yourself. Now, the only thing you can improve through cultivation is spiritual power. I have seen the first human to open the Heavenly Eye Acupoint in the Divine Continent over the years, but no one has been able to cultivate the Heavenly Eye Acupoint to its ultimate state. I hope to see this miracle happen with you.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"The evolution of the Heavenly Eye Acupoint seems to be related to spiritual power and innate Qi. I am only increasing my spiritual power now, and it is probably difficult to make it evolve again. Moreover, I vaguely feel that for an acupoint to evolve, it requires an immense amount of energy. My Heavenly Eye Acupoint evolving to the mid-stage is already very fortunate. To improve further, the energy required is absolutely terrifying. Whether it is spiritual power or innate Qi, it is probably a astronomical number.\"\n\nThe Dragon God said, \"Your judgment is very correct. The improvement of any acupoint requires an extraordinarily vast amount of energy, and the seven acupoints in the human body are all related to innate Qi. Without innate Qi, evolution is impossible. What I mean is, if you can first raise your spiritual power to a level where it is sufficient for the Heavenly Eye Acupoint to evolve to the final stage, then once you recover your life force and the ability to absorb innate Qi, your strength will undoubtedly leap significantly. No one has seen what the ultimate Heavenly Eye Acupoint looks like, but after my years of research, I vaguely feel that the Heavenly Eye Acupoint is actually the most important of the seven acupoints. The Gods and those who call themselves Gods in the Divine Continent are very superstitious about power. Therefore, their cultivation efforts are all directed towards the Imperial Acupoint. Now, almost every person who can call themselves a God possesses an Imperial Acupoint. And those who have cultivated the Imperial Acupoint to its ultimate state have reached a power level close to that of a God-King. I sincerely hope that you can focus on the Heavenly Eye Acupoint and open up a new cultivation path. Once successful, although I cannot predict what will happen, it will definitely bring you immense benefits.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"I am willing to try. Anyway, I have nothing else to cultivate now. Thank you for your guidance, Lord Dragon God. However, since we are going to the Divine Continent, can you tell me about things there? It will be easier for me to adapt when I get there.\"\n\nThe Dragon God remained silent for a while before saying, \"No, I cannot tell you about these things now, because once you reach the Divine Continent, you will not have the freedom to move around. You must know that bringing you back to the Divine Continent is already breaking a taboo. I cannot let the Gods in the Divine Continent know about your arrival. Therefore, your activity range in the Divine Continent will be fixed. Once you recover your life force, or if it is truly impossible to recover, I will immediately send you back to the Yangguang Continent. I hope you can understand my difficulties.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment and said, \"So that's how it is. I've really troubled you.\"\n\nThe Dragon God sighed and said, \"Actually, the Divine Continent is not as beautiful as some people imagine. Compared to the Divine Continent, the Yangguang Continent is simply paradise. The Divine Continent is more fittingly called hell. Without such harsh environments, those powerful Gods would not have been cultivated. The greatest characteristic of the Divine Continent is its harsh environment. You will hardly see any plants or creatures from the Yangguang Continent there, because every one or two days, a magic storm will occur. No one knows how these storms are formed, but even ordinary Gods cannot survive in these storms. Therefore, everyone practices desperately to survive. Only by continuously strengthening their own power can they have the right to live. The Divine Continent is full of crises everywhere. Any powerful magical beast is much stronger than the ordinary members of our Dragon Clan. The abilities of some top-tier magical beasts are beyond even my judgment, but I can guess that they possess at least God-King level strength.\"\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath and thought to himself that the Ice Snow Goddess's priest seemed to be cultivating diligently precisely to go to the Divine Continent. But hearing the Dragon God say this, the Divine Continent was not paradise at all, but rather hell. What good would it do to go there?\n\nThe Dragon God paused and continued, \"The Divine Continent also has its advantages. On that small continent, there are various rich mineral deposits. These minerals are the most precious and rare ores. The gemstone on the Xuan Ji Blade in your hand is a top-grade one. Do you know what is most precious on the Divine Continent?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head. He would not guess blindly about things he did not know.\n\n\"It's food.\" The Dragon God's voice contained a bit of helplessness. \"Originally, before the War of the Gods, the Divine Continent did not lack food. It was just a place for some powerful individuals to train and gradually formed a group of powerful people who called themselves Gods. But after the end of the Divine Remains War, although the Forgotten Kingdom was sent to another world, the Divine Continent lost its source of food. Without the support of the Forgotten Continent, the Gods there could only hunt powerful magical beasts to fill their stomachs. Coupled with the harsh conditions, the current Gods are generally much stronger than before, but their numbers have decreased by more than half. Newborns have no possibility of survival in such an environment.\"\n\nNian Bing asked with some doubt, \"With the abilities of those Gods on the Divine Continent, they should be able to reach the Yangguang Continent with ease, right? The Yangguang Continent has plenty of the food they need!\"\n\nThe Dragon God sighed and said, \"It's not that simple. Back then, to cast that level seventeen ultimate forbidden spell, the God-Kings requested several True Gods to come out of seclusion. Otherwise, no matter how willing the God-Kings were to sacrifice, they could not unleash such powerful strength. For God-Kings of my level, casting a level fourteen forbidden spell is already the limit. And after level twelve, the energy intensity increases exponentially with each level. Even if all of us God-Kings join forces, we can at most release level fifteen energy.\"",

    "content": "“True God? What is a True God?” Nian Bing asked curiously.\n\nThe Dragon God hesitated and said, “I was supposed to tell you about this, but you have shown great kindness to our dragon race, and I also believe in your character that you won’t speak carelessly. Remember, no matter where you are, do not casually reveal what I am about to tell you today. The so-called True Gods are humans who originally lived on the Divine Continent. Of course, I cannot be absolutely certain they were humans. The current gods on the Divine Continent are actually descendants of past powerhouses from the Forgotten Kingdom who combined with humans through their immense divine power. And long before humans entered the Divine Continent, there were already some races living there. We won’t mention the magical beasts, but among these races, the strongest were the True Gods. From what I know, there are four True Gods on the Divine Continent. They are all powerful beings possessing divine power that creates heavens and earth. I even suspect that the harsh climate on the Divine Continent was caused by these four. The strength of these four True Gods can only be described as terrifying. I once personally witnessed a True God casually unleash a forbidden spell of level fifteen. During the War of Divine Relics, the Divine Continent's gods were originally defeated, but they used the excuse that the Divine Continent was about to be devoured by the Forgotten Kingdom, and all the main gods jointly invited the four True Gods to assist. In the end, by exploiting certain peculiar habits of the four True Gods, three of them finally agreed to act. That level seventeen forbidden spell drew most of its power from them, while the main gods were merely the catalyst at the beginning. Since then, the four True Gods have not appeared again. However, their powerful strength left a deep impression on every god and human. Even the seals on the seven vials of the Moertas Seal originate from them. After the War of Divine Relics, the four True Gods issued a simultaneous warning, forbidding anyone on the Divine Continent from going to the Radiant Continent. Their warning was absolute divine will on the Divine Continent, and no one dared to disobey. Therefore, even if they starved to death due to lack of food, no one would dare to go to the Radiant Continent. Only the seven Dragon Kings who were left behind then guard the Moertas Seal vials. Thus, the Radiant Continent has remained peaceful until now.”\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, “So that’s how it is. It seems these four True Gods were quite farsighted.”\n\nThe Dragon God said, “No one knows the thoughts of the four True Gods, and their relationships with each other are not close, but they have never engaged in internal conflict, at least on the surface. They are all people who are extremely indifferent and do not care about worldly matters. This time, I am taking you to find one of the four True Gods. Only the power of a True God can possibly restore your life. Hearing this, the Dragon God’s voice carried a hint of fear. It was evident he was reluctant to meet this True God.\n\nNian Bing gave a slight gasp, “Didn’t you just say that all four True Gods have disappeared?”\n\nThe Dragon God said, “Many years ago, when I first succeeded to the position of Dragon God, I had dealings with one of the True Gods. He had a very strange temper. Because I inadvertently helped him with a small favor, he gave me a way to find him. He said that if I needed anything, I could find him, and he would definitely help me, depending on the difficulty of the matter. Moreover, the person he helped must pay a certain price. Therefore, I have a way to find a True God. However, I have never used this method for over ten thousand years. You have shown great kindness to our dragon race. If it weren’t for you, the dragon race would likely have no successors. That is why I have decided to use this method to help you. As for whether it will succeed, I have no confidence at all. I cannot even imagine how difficult the True God’s test will be. Therefore, you can only try to improve your abilities as much as possible so that you will have a chance to fight when facing the test. Do you understand what I mean?”\n\nNian Bing nodded solemnly and said, “Thank you, Lord Dragon God. I will work hard.” Hearing the Dragon God’s words, Nian Bing gained a new understanding of the Divine Continent. True Gods, what are these so-called True Gods like? On the Radiant Continent, the Ice Snow Goddess’s priest became the foremost human by being able to perform a divine descent spell of level twelve. That level seventeen forbidden spell managed to make a vast continent disappear completely. What kind of energy is that! Having the opportunity to meet a True God would also be a good thing.\n\nNian Bing felt no fear. He was already a dead person, so what was there to be afraid of? He was quite interested in the True Gods the Dragon God spoke of. While pondering the Dragon God’s words, he quickly recovered his spiritual power.\n\nWith the help of the six-pointed star, the Xuanji Blade, from the Divine Machine Transformation, Nian Bing could confidently recover his spiritual power. Coupled with the Dragon God’s guidance, he was not afraid of getting lost in this spatial tunnel. As soon as his spiritual power recovered to its full state, without any hesitation, he immediately put away the Xuanji Blade and began another process of cultivating his spiritual power.\n\nThe energy of space was still as violent as ever, but Nian Bing faintly felt that his spiritual power had increased significantly. The seven-colored light on his spiritual body within the Tianyan acupoint became even more dazzling. With each flicker, it would neutralize an attack from the spatial energy. Repeating this cycle, Nian Bing’s second attempt lasted a full third longer than the first.\n\nThrough the arduous tempering of intense pain, Nian Bing’s already good willpower became even more resolute. His firm resolve allowed him to control his spiritual power with increasing precision, often achieving the strongest effect with the minimum amount of spiritual power. With the continuous advancement and refinement of his spiritual power, the time it took for him to recover from the verge of collapse to full recovery became shorter and shorter, while the time he could withstand the chaotic energy in the spatial tunnel became longer and longer. Under these changes, Nian Bing’s spiritual power grew imperceptibly. The originally small spiritual body had gradually grown to about two inches, filling Nian Bing’s brow acupoint. As his strength increased, Nian Bing discovered something marvelous through his Tianyan acupoint. He found that when he looked at the outside world through the Tianyan acupoint, he could clearly distinguish every change in the energy elements in this distorted space. He progressed from only being able to discern general changes to being able to see all the details. His spiritual power had reached another realm. What surprised Nian Bing even more was that he discovered that the reason the spiritual body at his brow was seven-colored was not due to a mutation in his spiritual power. It was because, after he lost his life force, his magic power had followed his soul into his spiritual domain and merged with the spiritual body within the Tianyan acupoint. Although these magic powers could not be used, they were constantly strengthening as he cultivated his spiritual body. This discovery immediately greatly increased Nian Bing’s hope. Although he didn’t know if he could regain control of these magic powers and return them to his lower abdomen after his life force was restored, he faintly felt that these magic powers had not abandoned him. Once his life force was restored, even if his magic power could not return to its original place, he should be able to use these magic powers to cast spells in his current state.\n\nTime often flies by when cultivating. When Nian Bing recovered from his spiritual power collapse for the last time, the level fourteen spatial teleportation magic was no longer a threat to his body. His spiritual power protected his body like the Tianyan domain. No matter how the surrounding spatial energy impacted him, Nian Bing could react in advance. Using the impact of his spiritual power, he directly broke apart the weakest part of the spatial turbulence, greatly weakening it when it impacted his body. Although doing so would also weaken Nian Bing’s spiritual power, the rate of weakening had greatly decreased. Under these circumstances, he could last much longer.\n\n“I didn’t expect your progress to be so fast. It seems that although you are only twenty years old, you have cultivated very diligently during these twenty years. Coupled with some opportunities and innate talent, you have achieved what you have today,” the Dragon God’s voice finally resounded again. Nian Bing could feel the exhaustion in his divine sense. Having become familiar with this spatial teleportation magic, he could now clearly know the direction of the magic teleportation. Even without the Dragon God’s guidance, he knew which direction he should head towards.\n\n“Senior Dragon God, how much longer will it be until we reach the Divine Continent?”\n\nThe Dragon God said, “We are almost there. Prepare yourself. Take out the Xuanji Blade. When the magic array’s energy passes through the Divine Continent’s protective barrier, there will be drastic changes. The spatial energy fluctuations at that time will likely be unbearable for you. Prepare yourself, the energy impact is about to arrive.”\n\nNian Bing agreed, but he did not immediately take out the Xuanji Blade. Through the cultivation over these past few days, he could clearly feel the progress of his spiritual power. He had already independently comprehended methods of attacking with spiritual power. Even the true mental magic of the Bai Ren race would probably not be much stronger than his. This ample confidence made him even more eager for greater trials. Furthermore, due to the improvement of his spiritual power, the energy of this spatial teleportation magic array was no longer enough to pose a threat. In fact, due to the refinement of his spirit, he no longer felt pain. This gave him a bold idea: to use the upcoming spatial energy explosion for better training with his spiritual power.\n\nHis eyes shone brightly. Nian Bing carefully gathered his spiritual power around his body. The spiritual body in the Tianyan acupoint trembled violently. With each tremor, a large amount of spiritual power was released, but this spiritual power was not dispersed. Under Nian Bing’s skilled control, it waited for the moment of explosion.\n\nJust as Nian Bing finished preparing, an anomaly occurred. The entire space seemed to collapse instantly. The originally infinite silver space suddenly shrank, becoming a circular passage. The immense pressure caused the original spatial energy to swirl madly. Every time it touched Nian Bing’s body, it felt as if his spiritual power was being struck by the most immense energy of a volcanic eruption. His body was like a small boat constantly drifting in this incomparably vast energy.\n\nA pain more intense than when he first entered the spatial teleportation magic array assaulted Nian Bing’s mind and soul. However, he did not give up. His entire body radiated seven-colored flames, and with each burst, he fully exerted his spiritual power. He directly confronted the impacting spatial energy with his spiritual power. His body, nourished by his Dragon Soul and the Thickening Technique, trembled violently under the impact of the spatial energy. Countless fine wounds spread across every inch of his skin. Nian Bing felt as if he could be destroyed by this space at any moment.\n\nSpiritual power played a decisive role at this moment. Every burst from Nian Bing would dim the light of the little person in the Tianyan acupoint slightly. However, he dared not stop his resistance. Under the immense external pressure, even if he wanted to take out the Xuanji Blade now, he could not. Once his spiritual power dispersed, his main body would be the first to be destroyed.\n\nThe sound of shattering echoed clearly in Nian Bing’s mind. His brain fell completely blank. In this instant, he no longer felt intense pain, and the distortion of his body stopped. The spiritual power within the Tianyan acupoint finally collapsed under the stimulation of the vast external spatial pressure. The solidified spiritual power scattered like a tide. The immense energy of the tearing spatial distortion was actually forced open a range with a diameter of three zhang. Nian Bing’s body, starting from red, then passing through blue, green, yellow, silver, white, and black, flashed with seven colors. With each flash, Nian Bing could clearly feel the existence of magic elements. After his spiritual power was completely shattered, it instantly merged with his magic power. A strange feeling spread throughout his body. At this moment, the surrounding space suddenly calmed down, and all the ferocity disappeared.",

    "content": "The impact began madly. It was no longer an impact of spatial energy, but seven halos of light continuously erupting from Nian Bing's body. The seven magical elements, carrying fused spiritual power, surged back into his body through the Heavenly Eye acupoint, coursing through his meridians to every corner of his body, and then completely retracted into the Heavenly Eye acupoint. The halos condensed circle by circle towards the very center of the Heavenly Eye acupoint. Nian Bing regained consciousness. He didn't know what had happened, but he was very clear that although his spiritual power had collapsed, it hadn't disappeared. It had returned to the Heavenly Eye acupoint along with his magic power.\n\nWith a flash of light, Nian Bing felt his whole body lighten and found himself in another world. The surroundings were pitch black, with rumbling thunder deafening his ears and fierce winds blowing like knives, stimulating his body. Unfortunately, this sudden wind was not as oppressive as the spatial teleportation magic. Nian Bing could easily resist it with just his body. The air carried a hint of coldness. Nian Bing had no energy to observe his surroundings at the moment. He sat down on the ground, assumed a meditation posture, and completely focused his spirit on the Heavenly Eye acupoint between his eyebrows, feeling the seven-colored halos filling it.\n\nThe vast Heavenly Eye acupoint had now completely turned seven-colored. The seven halos were gathered at different positions, simultaneously surging towards a single point in the center of the Heavenly Eye acupoint. Nian Bing heard seven clear chirps. The seven-colored light flashed, and his seven divine sabers automatically emerged from his spatial ring, embedding themselves in the ground around his body. The seven-colored halos formed a colorful shield, encircling Nian Bing and continuously stimulating his body. The seven gems emitted dazzling light, and the seven magical elements continuously cleansed Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye acupoint. With each impact, the seven energies in the Heavenly Eye acupoint grew more immense.\n\nA golden-red figure lit up, and a middle-aged man, appearing to be in his fifties, appeared beside Nian Bing. A fiery red long cape cascaded down his back, and his ancient, resolute face looked somewhat weary. However, his eyes shot out brilliant rays of light, and an invisible layer of energy surrounded his body, preventing the gale from entering within three feet of him. At this moment, his entire focus was on Nian Bing. From outside to inside, he felt Nian Bing's changes. After a moment, the middle-aged man looked greatly astonished and muttered to himself, \"Breaking and then establishing. Well done, breaking and establishing! I didn't expect him to be able to produce such a peculiar situation. It seems the ultimate Heavenly Eye acupoint will bring me great surprises. Nian Bing, oh Nian Bing, you have finally entered the ranks of the strong. Well done, Ice and Fire Twin Source Mage.\"\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Nian Bing slowly woke from his meditative state. His body felt no different, still lifeless. However, his spiritual world had undergone a earth-shattering change. The Heavenly Eye acupoint was now like a starry sky, filled with brilliant stars, with seven main stars being the largest. Their colors represented different schools of magic. Around them, scattered smaller points of light from the same schools dispersed like vortexes, slowly revolving around the seven main stars. The red and blue star clusters intertwined and revolved around each other, these two main stars being the largest, while the other five star clusters revolved around the central intertwined star clusters. The seven star clusters formed a harmonious space, filling the entire Heavenly Eye domain. Nian Bing's soul power was condensed at the very center of the red and blue star clusters, a golden point of light. There was only one point, but it contained all of Nian Bing's spiritual and soul power. Through his soul's perception, Nian Bing could easily sense any subtle change within the Heavenly Eye acupoint, not only the seven main stars but even the scattered points of light around them, all of which he could fully control.\n\nEach point of light contained immense magical energy, which was completely compressed magical elements mixed with a large amount of spiritual power. It seemed as if each starry point was a point of Nian Bing's spiritual power. Wherever his will extended, everything was within his grasp. Slowly opening his eyes, the surrounding world appeared incredibly vivid before him. It wasn't just seeing the features of things clearly; Nian Bing could even discern the energy contained within a stone and the proportion of various combined energies within the stone, accurately judging and imprinting it into his mind in a fleeting glance.\n\nThe coldness remained, and the deathly stillness of his body persisted. But as Nian Bing floated up from the ground, he knew he had become different. He himself did not understand what had happened, but he knew that his Heavenly Eye acupoint had not evolved to its ultimate state but had undergone a strange mutation. This mutation had formed under various subtle circumstances, and he was not clear about its specific abilities.\n\nHe reined in his somewhat excited emotions and looked around. The surroundings were dim. Looking up at the sky, large swathes of dark clouds blocked the sunlight. Occasionally, flashes of light would appear, inevitably followed by rumbling thunder. The magical element content in the air was no different from that of the Yangguang Continent, but these magical elements were much more violent than those on the Yangguang Continent. To use the magical elements here to cast magic, one would need to expend at least three times more magic power than on the Yangguang Continent. Moreover, the magical elements here changed very quickly, requiring more effort to condense the required magical elements.\n\nThe surroundings were a valley, filled with only various gray-brown giant rocks. Most of the giant rocks were rough and uneven, severely weathered. Looking out, the surrounding environment resembled his own body, completely dead and still. The wind seemed to have calmed down a bit since he first arrived, but the wind here was peculiar. Each gust of wind seemed to be condensed, and once it blew against him, it produced an impact. For an ordinary person, these winds would likely be fatal. The Divine Continent, truly deserved to be called the Hell Continent!\n\n\"You are awake.\" A deep voice sounded, as if right next to his ear. The sudden voice startled Nian Bing. The spiritual power in his Heavenly Eye acupoint changed rapidly, and everything around him became clear. Through the fluctuations of the sound, Nian Bing's brow flashed, and a silver eye floated open. The silver eye did not emit silver light completely as before. In the center of the silver eye, there was a crystal-like eyeball. The clear and transparent eye subtly had a layer of seven-colored halo. A radiant divine light flashed, and Nian Bing's body drifted to the side, his spiritual power already locked onto the source of the sound.\n\n\"Such strong spiritual power. Breaking and then establishing. It seems you have discovered more changes from your Heavenly Eye acupoint.\" With a voice of relief, golden-red light flashed, and a tall figure appeared before Nian Bing. It was the middle-aged man who looked to be around fifty. He wore a gray robe, and a noble and imposing aura condensed and did not dissipate, giving people a feeling of reverence.\n\nUnder Nian Bing's spiritual power observation, the Dragon God before him was like a ball of pure fire, pure celestial fire. As soon as his spiritual power approached the energy shield around his body, it was immediately blocked by a vast amount of energy. All he could feel was immense power, that unfathomable feeling deeply shocking Nian Bing's heart. It was almost boundless energy!\n\n\"Nian Bing thanks Senior Dragon God for your guidance.\" He bowed respectfully, offering a deep bow to the Dragon God, a faint smile appearing on his face. His Heavenly Eye acupoint closed on its own.\n\nThe Dragon God nodded at him and said, \"Good. This time, your enlightenment and progress from the spatial teleportation magic array are far greater than I imagined. If your vitality can truly be restored, then your future will be immeasurable. Now, the spiritual power in your Heavenly Eye acupoint is like a bomb, but it lacks the fuse to ignite it.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"You mean innate energy. Indeed, the opening and growth of the seven acupoints seem to be greatly related to innate energy.\"\n\nThe Dragon God said, \"That's right. Innate energy is the foundation of the seven acupoints. However, there is an exception among the seven acupoints, and that is the Heavenly Eye acupoint. The Heavenly Eye acupoint is the only one that is not completely formed by innate energy; it requires more spiritual power. Innate energy is merely a catalyst. The other six acupoints are the exact opposite: spiritual power is the catalyst, and innate energy is the foundation. The first time you used the Life Ancestor Curse and approached death, the Seven Dragon Kings called out to my divine consciousness. At that time, I told them that if you could come to the Divine Continent one day, I would help you open one acupoint as a reward from the Dragon race. However, I cannot fulfill this promise now because your current body is fundamentally incapable of opening an acupoint. Introducing you to that great True God senior, the consequences are unpredictable!\"\n\nNian Bing earnestly said, \"Senior, the Dragon race has already helped me greatly. Without you, I would have likely died completely and would not have this opportunity now. Regardless of the outcome of this journey, I will only be grateful to the Dragon race. Fortune and misfortune are not greatly different. No matter what, I must try. For my family and loved ones, I must recover my life even with a sliver of a chance.\"\n\nThe Dragon God nodded and said, \"Good, then let us set off now. The Divine Continent is very small, not even as large as a country on the Yangguang Continent. The Divine Continent is divided into two parts: one is where ordinary gods and we, the Main Gods, reside. According to strength, those who have not opened any acupoints are called gods, those who have opened one acupoint can be called demigods, those who have opened two acupoints are gods, and those who have opened three or more acupoints are us Main Gods. Although the Dragon race has no acupoints, since the appearance of gods on the Divine Continent, the Dragon Gods of the Dragon race have always been among the Main Gods. Above the Main Gods are the four True Gods whose power no one knows the extent of. The senior I am taking you to meet is among the four True Gods, the one who calls himself the God of Life, Ka'ao.\"\n\nAs soon as the Dragon God finished speaking, golden-red light flared, encircling Nian Bing. With a flash of light, they had already soared into the sky like meteors. As soon as they left the ground, Nian Bing immediately felt the external energy constantly changing. Various violent energies were unevenly distributed in space. Strange scenes appeared before his eyes: in some places, fierce cold winds blew; in some places, hail fell; and in some places, flames continuously erupted from beneath the ground, with lava flowing everywhere. At first glance, it seemed that not a single spot of the ground below was calm.\n\nThe Dragon God, while flying rapidly in one direction, said to Nian Bing, \"The place where you were just now is called the Pure Land by the Divine Continent, meaning a place without rampant energy. All gods and people below the Main Gods on the Divine Continent live in the Pure Land. The Pure Land is scarce on the Divine Continent, and places suitable for survival are even fewer. Perhaps you cannot imagine that gods often fight over a drop of pure water without impurities. On this continent, there are constant crises that humans on the Yangguang Continent cannot imagine. A moment of carelessness can lead to death. On the Divine Continent, it is generally divided into two major parts. Four-fifths of the area is like this, and the remaining one-fifth constitutes the four forbidden lands of the Divine Continent. Even Main Gods dare not enter these forbidden lands, because in each forbidden land lives a True God, and no one dares to offend the dignity of a True God.\"\n\nNian Bing said with a wry smile, \"It truly is a world like hell! I'm afraid even if my vitality hadn't been lost, it would be very difficult to survive on this continent.\"\n\nThe Dragon God said, \"Indeed. Although the War of the Gods caused the Lost Kingdoms to disappear completely, the Divine Continent also suffered a devastating blow. The gods here can only struggle for survival.\"\n\nThe Dragon God's flight speed was extremely fast, and the scenery below blurred by like an illusion. In a blink of an eye, Nian Bing saw a faint white light appear in the distance, obscuring the path ahead like clouds and fog.\n\nThis was the first time Nian Bing had seen such a wall-like cloud and fog. Just as he was about to ask the Dragon God, the Dragon God's speed slowed down, and he landed gracefully, stopping on a rock.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was about to ask, his spirit in the Heavenly Eye acupoint suddenly moved. He subconsciously leaped forward, and a green figure flashed past the position he had just occupied. In that instant, relying on the Heavenly Eye acupoint, Nian Bing had clearly seen it: it was a creature about three feet long, shaped like a lizard, covered all over with green scales. Its body was slender, but its speed was extremely fast. Its head occupied almost half of its body size. With just a flash, it moved to the side, a pair of large black eyes shooting out greedy light, fixing their gaze on Nian Bing and the Dragon God.\n\nThe Dragon God seemed to not sense the creature's presence. His body radiated golden-red light, his eyes looking straight ahead at the opaque white mist. He continuously let out deep dragon roars.",

    "content": "The emerald lizard’s pounce missed. With barely any pause, it powerfully propelled its thick limbs, shooting towards Nian Bing like an arrow. Clearly, it dared not attack the Dragon God, who was emitting a golden-red light. Nian Bing did not dodge this time. He raised his right hand, releasing his mental energy to form an invisible net that enveloped the space within a three-zhang radius. He easily grasped the trajectory of the charging lizard. Although he could no longer use magic, his physical body had reached a new level of might. Under the influence of his mental energy, as the lizard lunged towards him, he slightly shifted his body, striking with his palm like a blade directly at the connection between the lizard’s head and body. His formidable physique granted Nian Bing extreme speed and attack power. With a dull thud, his palm struck the lizard.\n\nThe lizard’s forward momentum instantly changed to a downward fall. It rolled on the ground and then leaped up again. Nian Bing felt that his palm strike, which could easily cleave a large rock, had not caused it any damage.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was startled, the lizard charged forward again. Unfortunately, although its speed was fast, Nian Bing, relying on the precise analysis of his Heavenly Eye, completely determined its attack route. He only needed to unleash a palm strike with his body’s strength to send it flying the moment it neared him. However, the lizard’s body was also extremely tough. After being struck by Nian Bing several times, it had not sustained any damage. It merely continued to attack Nian Bing in its fury. Nian Bing also considered taking out his divine blade to kill the lizard, but through his mental energy observation, he clearly saw that the lizard’s own energy was not very strong. Was it not ridiculous to use a magic blade against such a creature? A competitive spirit arose, and Nian Bing’s mental energy immediately surged. He prepared to use his newly learned attack method to deal with this lizard. With his Heavenly Eye energy fully unleashed, the lizard appeared as a mass of green energy in his eyes, and within this green energy, there seemed to be a small cluster of red.\n\nNian Bing’s mental energy acted the instant he made his judgment. A faint seven-colored light enveloped Nian Bing’s body, and his Heavenly Eye suddenly brightened. In the next moment, the lizard flying in mid-air instantly froze. It was forcibly locked by Nian Bing’s mental energy, unable to even struggle. Following this, the Heavenly Eye on Nian Bing’s brow lit up again, and with a \"puff,\" the lizard dissolved into a rain of blood.\n\nNian Bing waved his right hand, and a small, bright red light within the bloody rain was drawn into his hand. It was a small, crystalline, yet soft and yielding object. It looked transparent like a gemstone, but it lacked the hardness of a gemstone. A sudden urge to devour blood welled up in him. Without much hesitation, he directly threw this small crystal into his mouth. The crystal transformed into a warm current that entered Nian Bing’s body. His body, originally filled with deathly energy, immediately felt an extremely comfortable sensation after the crystal entered his abdomen. Nian Bing’s eyes instantly turned red, filled with that malevolent aura. His entire body, which was filled with stillness and death, also lit up with a layer of dark red light. Soon, the light faded, and he clearly felt that his strength seemed to have increased again. With a movement of his body, he returned to the Dragon God’s side, his speed also having increased slightly.\n\nThe sensation of devouring blood disappeared. Nian Bing’s mind began to race. The lizard just now was clearly a creature from the Divine Continent. Why did he feel his strength increase after eating the crystal from its body? Could these crystals be tonics? Just as he was pondering, the golden-red light from the Dragon God’s body receded. He took a deep breath and smiled, “Senior has already permitted us to enter. Nian Bing, why did you eat the demon core of the green lizard? That thing will gradually harden when exposed to wind and become an ordinary gemstone. Can it be eaten?”\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment and said, “Senior Dragon God, after I killed that lizard with my mental energy just now, I just felt somewhat nauseous in my heart. It seemed like only eating that thing would make me feel comfortable.”\n\nThe Dragon God looked deeply at Nian Bing, sighed, and said, “These are all residual problems from the zombie art. You are now a zombie, and you will have the urge to drink blood at regular intervals. Perhaps this is also the reason. Alright, let’s go in first.” As he spoke, he flicked his right hand, and a golden light appeared in his palm. This golden light seemed alive, constantly flickering as it pulsed, emitting faint sounds. The Dragon God’s eyes flashed, and he injected his energy into this golden-red light. The golden light transformed into an arrow shape and suddenly drilled into the white mist in front of them. Instantly, a layer of golden luster appeared on the white mist. The golden light slowly spread outward, forming the shape of a door. The white mist within the golden light immediately became much thinner. The Dragon God nodded to Nian Bing and led him towards the golden door. As they passed through the golden portal, Nian Bing suddenly felt an itch all over his body, and many fine points of light energy directly drilled into his body. This was energy full of life, and it quietly dissipated upon contact with the deathly energy on his body. Recalling the title of God of Life, Nian Bing’s heart grew warm.\n\nFrom the outside, the white mist looked like a thin layer, but upon entering, Nian Bing realized that this seemingly thin white mist was actually over ten zhang thick. The further they walked, the more concentrated the life energy became.\n\nAs they passed through the white mist under the protection of the golden light, the scenery before them suddenly changed. The sky was cloudless, a deep blue like the ocean, clear as a mirror. There were no clouds for thousands of miles. Looking up at the sky, one felt their spirits lift. The explosive magic elements in the air had disappeared. The magic elements here were much richer than in the outside world, but also much gentler. As far as the eye could see, there was greenery everywhere. Various exotic flowers and plants, accompanied by the chirping of birds and insects, wove a moving tapestry. Not far away, a layer of water vapor permeated the air. A clear lake lay peacefully in the center of the vegetation. The lake was crystal clear, like a giant blue crystal inlaid on the ground. In the very center of the lake grew a giant banyan tree. The banyan tree was thick, so thick that ten people could not encircle it. The leaves of the banyan tree were extremely lush, like a giant umbrella, covering an area of several hundred zhang. Its emerald shadow was reflected in the lake, looking so soft.\n\nIn a corner of the banyan tree, half of a wooden house protruded from the branches and leaves. The wooden house was not large; judging by its exterior, the area inside would not exceed twenty square meters. The wooden house and the banyan tree were integrated, as if they were one. Some water birds skimmed across the lake, and the gentle breeze stirred ripples on the lake’s surface, bringing a touch of vitality to this tranquil space.\n\nNian Bing was stunned, and the Dragon God was equally stunned. He had not expected that the dwelling place of this True God would be so beautiful. Nian Bing sighed softly, \"This is the realm of a True God! So beautiful.\" He couldn’t help but envy this God of Life, Kael. He imagined how wonderful it would be if he could live in such a place with the three women he loved.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was about to step forward, he was pulled back by the Dragon God. The Dragon God gave him a look, and then glanced at the various plants growing on the ground. Nian Bing immediately understood his meaning and stopped, casting his gaze towards the wooden house in the lake. The Dragon God bowed slightly and respectfully said, “Dragon Clan Kajiokis, bringing young human friend Nian Bing, requests an audience with Senior.” His voice was not loud, but Nian Bing saw through his Heavenly Eye that the voice, under the Dragon God’s control, traveled directly towards the wooden house in the lake.\n\nA faint, indifferent voice echoed from all directions, “Kajiokis, we haven’t seen each other in a long time. What you’ve brought is not a human, is it?” This calm and gentle voice, no matter how Nian Bing tried to trace it, he still couldn’t sense where it came from. The voice was very neutral, and Nian Bing couldn’t even discern the gender of this God of Life. However, every word in the voice was so clear, and every word deeply shocked his heart.\n\nThe Dragon God Kajiokis quickly said, “Senior, this is exactly what Kajiokis is requesting of you, and I ask for your help.”\n\n“I understand what you mean. You may return, but leave him here.” The indifferent voice sounded again. This time, the aura in the voice seemed to have changed. Nian Bing felt his spirit violently shaken. The deathly energy within his body was completely suppressed by an invisible pressure, rendering him unable to move at all. Only his mental energy remained active.\n\nThe Dragon God was overjoyed and quickly said, “Thank you, Senior, for fulfilling my request. Then I shall take my leave.”\n\n“Wait, there is one thing I must tell you in advance. I loathe the aura of death the most. Bringing a dead person here has already offended me. If you wish to leave, you will have to pay a price. The life force of the Dragon Clan has always been the most abundant among all races. You shall leave half of your life force.” The indifferent voice remained calm, but Nian Bing’s heart was stirred by a storm. He had witnessed the Dragon God’s strength firsthand. That incredibly powerful level fourteen teleportation magic was so wondrous, yet this God of Life, whom he hadn't even met, casually demanded half of the Dragon God's life force with a single sentence.\n\nThe Dragon God’s expression slightly changed. He gazed towards the giant banyan tree in the lake, his eyes constantly flickering. Nian Bing could feel through his Heavenly Eye that the energy within the Dragon God was fluctuating rapidly, as if it could explode at any moment. The Dragon God’s voice rang out, “Alright, as long as Senior can revive our Dragon Clan friend, what’s wrong with leaving half of my life force as tribute?”\n\n“Senior Dragon God, no!” Nian Bing disregarded the corpse poison on his body and grabbed the Dragon God. The Dragon God smiled slightly, “Nian Bing, you once willingly released all your life force for our Dragon Clan. I only need to use half my life force to repay this kindness, and frankly, I’m making a profit. Although the life force of our Dragon Clan is not infinite, the remaining life force can at least allow me to live for tens of thousands more years. Do not stop me. Since Senior has already agreed to help you, this is already very fortunate.”\n\nA determined glint flashed in Nian Bing’s eyes. He turned around, facing the center of the lake, and said loudly, “True God Senior, Senior Dragon God came here entirely for me. I would rather not recover my life force myself than have him suffer any harm. Please retract your order. I will not seek treatment from you.” If he were to be reborn in exchange for half of the Dragon God’s life force, he would never feel at peace for the rest of his life.\n\nThe indifferent voice rang out once more, “You have no right to speak to me. The Dragon God is atoning for his transgression, not paying the price for you. I once promised to help him once, and I can fulfill that promise. However, for his offense against me, he must also pay a price.”\n\nNian Bing quickly said, “Then this transaction, since you once promised to help Senior Dragon God once, let this time be considered your help by letting him go. I do not need your healing.”\n\n“Have you thought it through? If the conditions are exchanged, you, a mere undead, have entered here and polluted my space. Your only outcome will be annihilation.”\n\nNian Bing let out a cold snort, “Fine. Release Senior Dragon God, I have thought it through.”\n\nThe Dragon God anxiously said, “Nian Bing, you cannot! Why did I bring you here? Have you forgotten? If you don’t think for yourself, don’t you think of those who care about you?”\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, “If I choose to let you lose half of your life force out of selfishness, even if I am revived, I’m afraid my lovers will look down on me. Rather than that, I would prefer to remain perfect in their hearts forever. Senior Dragon God, hurry and leave.”\n\nThe Dragon God sighed. Nian Bing’s thoughts were clear to him, but since they had already come here, how could he let Nian Bing die like this? He took a deep breath. Just as he was about to release his life force, a green light suddenly illuminated from the banyan tree in the lake. The green was crystal clear, like a rainbow, connecting from the central treehouse all the way to the lakeshore. A faint figure appeared. In the next moment, this figure had arrived at the lakeshore, lightly floating in mid-air. The plants seemed excited by her arrival, and flowers bloomed one after another. In an instant, the surroundings turned into an ocean of flowers, and the rich life energy nourished every plant.\n\nThe surging life energy suppressed Nian Bing’s deathly aura. He discovered with horror that he was now so disgusted by the life energy, which he had always liked, that it constantly invaded his body. Under the pressure of this life energy, his deathly aura gradually retreated. Within the life energy, his body felt as if it were burning.\n\nThe intense physical pain did not affect Nian Bing’s vision, and it was precisely because of the visual impact that his perception of physical pain was greatly reduced. The person who floated down from the green rainbow was far from the ancient figure he had imagined. She was a woman, not particularly beautiful. She appeared to be in her early twenties, with long, light green hair that fell to the ground behind her, touching the plants. Against the backdrop of the flowers, her light green dress looked so ethereal. She was not beautiful, just an ordinary woman, only her skin was a bit fair. Compared to the peerless beauties like Feng Nu and Lan Chen, she was nothing; even Dragon Ling was more beautiful than her.",

    "content": "However, the woman exuded an aura that Nian Bing had never encountered before. It didn't seem to belong to a human. In her similarly deep ink-green eyes, a magnetic field like an ocean of life emanated outward. Her not-so-beautiful face appeared so gentle amidst the immense life aura. Looking at her, Nian Bing knew that the pain he was currently enduring was not intentional on her part, but was caused by the life magnetic field that spontaneously existed around her body.\n\nIf one does not explode in silence, one will surely perish in silence. Nian Bing no longer had time to ponder over this woman, who might be the Goddess of Life. For survival, he reacted immediately. The Sky Eye acupoint on his brow lit up, and a faint layer of seven-colored light erupted from within, spraying outward. Facing the life aura, he instantly created a spiritual barrier around his body.\n\nThe Sky Eye acupoint, due to the vast spiritual power and the fact that it had once stored Nian Bing's soul, had not been affected by the death aura of zombie術 (zombie arts). Spiritual power was completely different from the death aura. Moreover, after the Sky Eye acupoint mutated, its spiritual energy was a hybrid of innate energy, spiritual power, and seven types of magical elements. This gave Nian Bing a very peculiar spiritual energy. These energies did not reject the life aura; in fact, they were close to it. Therefore, as soon as his spiritual power was released, Nian Bing immediately adapted to the energy within the life magnetic field, and the pain vanished instantly. He couldn't help but exhale in relief.\n\nThe maiden let out a soft exclamation of surprise, her gaze involuntarily drawn to Nian Bing. As Nian Bing's death-filled eyes met her incredibly clear, verdant ones, he felt his entire body tremble violently. The death qi surged madly, and his body felt as if it might collapse at any moment. Terrified, he quickly closed his eyes and used his Sky Eye to observe the maiden before him.\n\nAfter its new evolution, the Sky Eye acupoint had reached an extremely precise level in observing energy. However, at this moment, as Nian Bing looked at the maiden, he was astonished to find that what appeared within his Sky Eye acupoint was a crystal, a green humanoid crystal, with no energy for him to judge anything. It was entirely composed of immense vitality. Circles of green halos floated gracefully, nourishing all living things around it. It was precisely this life magnetic field that had nearly cost him his life earlier.\n\n\"Strange, a zombie with an opened Sky Eye acupoint. How very strange.\" The maiden raised her hand and gently waved in Nian Bing's direction. Nian Bing had no possibility of struggling as he was grasped by a pale green human hand. Although he tried his best to project his spiritual power outward, attempting to break free, this immense life aura was simply too powerful, giving him no chance to struggle. At this moment, Nian Bing recalled the Mu Rong siblings from the Lang Mu Empire during the martial arts competition in the Hua Rong Empire. Weren't their life magic similar to this maiden? It was just not on the same level.\n\n\"Senior, please show mercy,\" the Dragon God said nothing, but stood there, respectfully bowing to the maiden before him. His action had confirmed that this maiden was indeed the Goddess of Life, who had a masculine name.\n\nKao¹ said indifferently, \"This little zombie already said he doesn't need your help. I'll spare you this time; you can leave.\"\n\nThe Dragon God said anxiously, \"Senior, I am willing to release half of my life force. Please save this human.\"\n\nKao's gaze, calm as still water, fell upon the Dragon God. The Dragon God only felt a slight tremor throughout his body, a strange sensation causing his heart to tremble slightly. Kao said calmly, \"You may go. This human's physical structure is rather interesting, and I might not kill him. I consider myself to have repaid the debt of gratitude to the Dragon race.\"\n\nThe Dragon God was overjoyed. Although the Goddess of Life, Kao, had not stated it directly, he vaguely understood her meaning. He quickly agreed and turned to walk towards the golden portal. Watching the Dragon God leave, Nian Bing, who was restrained by the barrier, immediately felt a sense of relief. The Dragon race had already helped him enough. If the Dragon God were to be implicated because of him, Nian Bing would never be able to find peace.\n\n\"Do you know why I haven't killed you yet?\" Kao's gaze fell upon Nian Bing again.\n\nBecause Nian Bing was in a zombie body, his gaze could not meet hers. He could only close his eyes and use his Sky Eye to look at the Goddess of Life before him and said, \"Perhaps it's because of my spiritual power.\"\n\n\"Indeed, it is because of your peculiar spiritual power that I have spared your life. Judging by the death aura on your body, you haven't been a zombie for long, and the wickedness within the death qi is still mild. From your personality, you haven't been influenced by zombie arts. Among humans, someone with spiritual power reaching your level is considered quite rare. However, the reason I am not killing you is not because your consciousness is clear. Death aura is the aura I detest the most. Your presence in my realm of life, with the death qi on your body, has polluted the aura here. I am not killing you because the strange spiritual power within your Sky Eye acupoint is something I have never encountered before. Therefore, I am temporarily sparing your life.\"\n\nLooking at Kao, Nian Bing felt a flicker of hope. What Kao had just said was the longest statement she had made since appearing. It was evident that she was very curious about his spiritual power. If he could use this situation to his advantage, with her knowing curiosity and immense, powerful vitality, perhaps he could truly return to being human.\n\nThinking this, Nian Bing immediately became more polite. \"Senior Kao, sometimes even I feel that my spiritual power is very strange. Unfortunately, because I released my life force to perform a spell back then, my life force was completely depleted. Without the support of innate energy, my spiritual power can no longer be unleashed to its fullest extent. Although my spiritual power has improved during the journey here, I don't fully understand where its progress lies.\"\n\nKao looked at Nian Bing, frowning slightly. \"Remember, from now on, continuously protect your body with your spiritual power. If I detect even a trace of death aura leaking out, I will immediately erase you from this world.\"\n\nBefore Nian Bing could react, the giant green life hand of the maiden flung him away, directly crashing into the white mist surrounding him. Nian Bing felt his entire body tighten, rendering him unable to move. Although his spiritual power could protect his body from being harmed by the external life aura, maintaining such a state was extremely draining on his spiritual power. Fortunately, Nian Bing's spiritual power had broken through again, allowing him to maintain the spiritual energy to protect every part of his body.\n\nKao seemed to have forgotten Nian Bing and looked at the blooming hundred flowers around her, her gaze softening considerably. With a slight wave of her right hand, she plucked a fresh flower from the nearby branches and leaves. She kissed the flower with her red lips, then picked off the petals one by one, slowly sending them into her mouth, chewing them lightly and eating a flower. The calyx fell to the ground and burrowed into the soil, growing into a new flower in a short time. Kao's movements were gentle. Each flower she ate was different, and throughout the process of eating the flowers, a faint smile always graced her face, as if this were the most enjoyable thing in the world for her.\n\n\"Do gods also need to eat?\" Nian Bing, restrained by the white mist, felt a pang of loneliness and couldn't help but ask.\n\nKao glanced at him without looking, waved her hand, and a green light flashed. Nian Bing felt a sharp pain on his face, and then this pain instantly transferred into his mind, becoming a complete internal agony. His body trembled, and he almost lost control of his spiritual power to protect himself. Fortunately, this energy came and went quickly, disappearing in an instant.\n\nKao's cold voice echoed in Nian Bing's ears, \"If you disturb my meal again, I will make you wish you were dead.\"\n\nNian Bing said with a wry smile, \"Senior, could you let me say something? I just feel that eating flowers like this is a terrible waste of nature's bounty! So many rare flowers and exotic plants are not meant to be eaten like this.\"\n\nKao paused for a moment, her tone of coldness clearly diminishing. \"You know how these flowers should be eaten?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Flowers can be used as medicine, and flowers can also be used in cooking. Different flowers need to be consumed in different ways to fully bring out their properties. For example, these small red flowers to your left, they are called Red Clever Plum Blossoms. They have the effects of reducing internal heat, reducing inflammation, detoxifying, beautifying the skin, and delaying aging. They need to be steeped in warm water with some rock sugar added. For women, they can eliminate some age spots on the skin, which is much better than eating them directly. Also, the petals of these pale purple flowers to your right are lustrous and uniform, with a delicate and gradual purple hue. They should be rare Purple Luo Fragrant treasures. Their effects can moisturize the skin, remove wrinkles and spots, and most importantly, they can alleviate common coughs, throat and nasal discomfort, and other symptoms. Of course, these are things that wouldn't happen to you.\"\n\nKao listened to Nian Bing's words and couldn't help but become interested, asking, \"Then how should this Purple Luo Fragrance be eaten?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Most flowers are not eaten directly. Eating them directly yields less effect, and although the fragrance is present, it is often accompanied by some bitterness, which is not pleasant. The true way to consume this Purple Luo Fragrance is to crush the petals to extract the purple juice, or to dry them and steep them in hot water. During the steeping process, the color will change, quickly turning from transparent to purple, and then gradually to brown. If some orange juice is added, it will turn the liquid pink. It's a wondrous enjoyment, whether to drink or to behold.\" Nian Bing had specially studied the incorporation of medicinal herbs into cuisine under the guidance of Cha Ji². He had once been given a book by Cha Ji that exclusively discussed the consumption methods of various rare flowers and exotic plants. Unfortunately, rare flowers and exotic plants were difficult to find, and he possessed theoretical knowledge but had never practiced it. As soon as he saw the Goddess of Life causing the surrounding fresh flowers to grow, Nian Bing recognized the origins of these flowers based on his memory, which was why he couldn't help but speak of their effects when Kao was eating the flowers. Culinary arts were Nian Bing's passion. Despite being in a perilous situation, when something that interested him suddenly appeared, he couldn't help but talk about it.\n\nListening to Nian Bing's words, Kao's eyes radiated life aura, revealing a faint smile. \"Interesting. I didn't expect a little zombie like you to know so much about flowers. It seems not killing you was the right choice. However, you mentioned orange juice and rock sugar earlier, which I don't have here. I know you and the Dragon God passed through the barrier to enter the Divine Continent, so you must be from the Yangguang Continent.\"\n\nSeeing that Kao's tone had softened considerably, Nian Bing's heart also relaxed, and he nodded. \"Yes, I am indeed from the Yangguang Continent. To be honest, I truly envy that you have so many rare flowers and exotic plants here. In the Yangguang Continent, any one of them is not easily found. What a pity, what a pity!\"\n\nKao said indifferently, \"The seeds of these flowers and plants were collected by me from several continents. Most of them are from the Yangguang Continent, but they are relatively scarce there. Here, they are fully developed. Since you have the ability to identify flowers, I would like to hear what other insights you have about these flowers.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Then I must first ask, Senior, with your abilities, eating flowers is likely not for sustenance, is it?\"\n\nKao glanced at Nian Bing and said, \"Tasting the different flavors of the petals of various flowers brings me different life sensations. For me, it is simply an enjoyment. Only in my realm of life, filled with life aura, can these flowers, which bloom in different seasons, fully open.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Since you are only enjoying the wondrous flavors of the flowers, then you shouldn't eat them directly. After processing, the flavors produced by these flowers will only become more delightful. Years ago, my master taught me a method for brewing Hundred Flower Dew. Hundred Flower Dew can be considered both wine and a beverage, and it must be brewed using the petals of a hundred different fresh flowers. As you know, where can one find a hundred types of fresh flowers in ordinary places? Even if one could gather them, some of the fresh flowers might have already withered. The taste of Hundred Flower Dew brewed from different flowers varies. Concentrating the fragrance of a hundred flowers and preserving the nuances of each flower's flavor is the mark of top-tier Hundred Flower Dew.\n\nThe more peculiar the flowers, the more magical the Hundred Flower Dew brewed from them will be. Unfortunately, with the death aura on my body, I could easily contaminate the flowers here. Otherwise, I could really help you brew some Hundred Flower Dew, which would be the ultimate delicacy, the pinnacle of incorporating flowers into cuisine! \" Whether human or god, everyone has desires. In the shortest possible time, Nian Bing had grasped the desire of this Goddess of Life. Women all like flowers, and from her dazed appearance while eating flowers, it was clear that she had a special fondness for them. At this moment, Nian Bing thought of Cha Ji, and he increasingly felt how useful the knowledge Cha Ji had imparted to him was.\n\n\"Hundred Flower Dew, Hundred Flower Dew, does that mean putting a hundred flowers together?\"\n\n---\n¹ Kao (卡奧) is likely a transliteration of a name, possibly referring to the Goddess of Life.\n² Cha Ji (查極) is a name, likely Nian Bing's master.",

    "content": "Kaao's face already showed a hint of curiosity. His eyes, full of life, shone with the light of hope.\n\nNian Bing said, \"Of course, it's not that simple. The brewing of Hundred Flower Dew requires special craftsmanship. Because the natures of flowers are all different, they must be brewed gradually, classified separately, rather than being put together all at once. Otherwise, once the flowers mix and poison each other, the Hundred Flower Dew, if successfully made, will instead become a poison.\"\n\n\"You can brew this Hundred Flower Dew?\" Kaao's voice held a hint of joy.\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"On the continent of Yang Guang, I am a chef. Hundred Flower Dew is the finest wine and also the finest seasoning. Unfortunately, even my master only knew the brewing method but never succeeded in refining it, precisely because he could not gather the numerous rare and precious flowers.\"\n\nKaao's voice suddenly became calm, \"Are you trying to exchange the method of refining Hundred Flower Dew for me to help you restore your vitality?\"\n\nNian Bing frankly replied, \"Of course. Perhaps this refining method is the only thing of value I can offer you. The exchange of interests is always the most reasonable. Begging or using emotions is not as good as a direct exchange of interests. I believe that if you are willing to heal me, you will surely regret it. After all, with your strength, even if I am reborn, you can destroy me at any time, can't you?\"\n\n\"You are very honest,\" Kaao smiled, a hint of admiration in his eyes. \"I like honest people. Fine, then I will exchange with you. However, if the Hundred Flower Dew you speak of cannot satisfy me, then you probably won't even be able to be a zombie. I have never easily trusted humans. To gain my trust, you must first name at least ten flowers around us and describe their uses.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"That's no problem. What I can do now is to trust your promise. As one of the Four True Gods of the Continent of Gods, I believe you will not go back on your word. Can you let me down? I guarantee I will use my mental power to block the death aura and will not contaminate your beautiful realm of life.\" His voice no longer held its initial reverence. Nian Bing knew that this so-called God of Life had likely lived for countless years, and his eccentric personality could not be pleased with mere respect. Since that was the case, wouldn't it be more comfortable to just be himself? As long as he still had value, he could naturally survive.\n\nKaao casually waved his hand, pulling Nian Bing down from the white mist. Under the surge of life essence, he floated above the flowers but did not fall, clearly indicating a desire for him not to trample the life-filled plants.\n\nNian Bing's gaze swept over, not looking at Kaao, but fully focused on the flowers before him. Suddenly, his eyes lit up, and he pointed to a pale yellow flower composed of countless petals of the same size, with a very short stem. \"Ah! This should be the Bright Lotus Snow Lily. Heavens! You actually have this kind of flower here too! The Bright Lotus Snow Lily only grows on high mountain peaks amidst snow and ice; it is a flower with extremely tenacious vitality, known as the twin beauties of the snow along with the snow lotus. It has a miraculous effect in dispelling fire, and ordinary people who consume it for a long time can prolong their lives and slow down aging.\"\n\nKaao pondered for a moment and said, \"Indeed, the seeds of this flower were obtained by me from a high mountain, surrounded by ice and snow. It seems you do have some skills.\"\n\nNian Bing acted as if he hadn't heard Kaao's compliment, and his gaze fell upon a cluster of pale blue small flowers nearby. \"Too amazing, you even have this. This also grows on high mountains and snowy peaks, but its growing altitude is even higher than the Bright Lotus Snow Lily. It is called the Jade Beauty. Blue sky, white clouds, snow-capped mountains, green grass—only at the peak of the mysterious, sacred extreme can this strange flower be nurtured. It is known as the Snow Peak Sacred Grass and has the effects of nourishing Yin, strengthening Yang, regulating Qi and blood, and moisturizing the skin and hair. A common method of consumption is to steep it in boiling water. The soup will have a clear, pale green hue, emitting a subtle floral fragrance, and its taste is mild and mellow.\"\n\nA hint of surprise appeared in Kaao's eyes. \"Enough, I believe you. These two flowers are indeed among the most difficult to obtain. Since you can even recognize them, I believe your claim about Hundred Flower Dew is not a lie.\"\n\nNian Bing asked, \"Then are you willing to help me restore my vitality now?\"\n\nKaao calmly replied, \"Yes, but recovering your vitality in your current condition is actually quite difficult. Simply put, your body has become a zombie. Although you are still conscious and controlling your body, you have long been a dead person. I am the God of Life, but not the God of Death. Anyone who still has a breath of life, I can easily save. However, you are already dead. My life force will only be harmful to you. To make you truly alive again is somewhat difficult and requires some auxiliary items, which are not things I can possess here.\"\n\nNian Bing asked, \"Then what items are needed to make my body accept life force again?\"\n\nKaao said, \"A peculiar medicinal substance is needed. Through this substance, the death aura within your body can be completely expelled, turning your body into a state of newly deceased. Then, using life force to stimulate the innate Qi, your bodily functions can be revived, and you can truly become a living person. Originally, you had no hope of resurrection, but because you opened the Li Zhong acupoint, when you lost your life force, the innate Qi within your body remained completely in the Li Zhong acupoint, giving you a sliver of hope.\"\n\nLooking at Kaao's calm expression, Nian Bing asked, \"Then where can this medicinal substance be found?\"\n\nKaao said indifferently, \"If you wish to gain new life, you must work hard yourself. Go out from here, follow the direction I point, and cross three mountains. You will see a black waterfall. Behind the waterfall, there is a fruit tree. Pick three white fruits from it and bring them back to me.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart tightened. Although he and the Dragon God had not been on the Continent of Gods for long, the strange sights of the Continent of Gods had left a deep impression on him. In his current state, the only abilities he could use besides his physical strength were his mental power. Crossing three mountains sounded easy, but actually doing it might not be so easy.\n\n\"What, are you scared?\" Kaao glanced sideways at Nian Bing. \"Didn't you sound quite confident when talking about these flowers just now? Since you dared to come here, you must have had some psychological preparation. To tell you the truth, those three fruits are very important to me as well, but I promised those three people that I would not leave here easily. This time, consider it me using you. Your body only needs one fruit; the other two will be your payment.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Scared? I'm already dead, what is there to be afraid of? Moreover, although this is the Continent of Gods, it may not necessarily be where I perish. Please show me the way.\" The three people who could threaten the God of Life, without a doubt, must be the other three True Gods.\n\nKaao looked at Nian Bing. A hint of faint admiration appeared on his calm face. \"In all these years, besides those three people, you are the only one who dares to be so disrespectful to me. Because of your knowledge of flowers, I will spare your life. But if you die on the way, you can only blame yourself. Follow the direction of this path, you may go now.\" With a wave of his hand, a faint golden light appeared in his palm. As the light flickered, a golden passage opened the white mist again, giving Nian Bing a new path. Nian Bing felt as if his body was carried on clouds and fog, transported to the edge of the passage out of nowhere, precisely so as not to touch anything in the realm of life. It seemed this God of Life was truly fastidious!\n\nWithout further hesitation, Nian Bing pushed off the ground, and with a few flashes, he exited the barrier of the realm of life. All along, he had primarily relied on magic. Although he had gained a powerful physique, he had not trained in any physical techniques and knew very little about how to utilize his body. The zombie technique and the dragon soul modification had given him a physique far superior to ordinary people. Even in his unfamiliarity with his body, his speed was very fast. His entire body was filled with death aura, making him unable to truly feel the extent of his strength. However, Nian Bing knew very well that his journey ahead would likely depend on the combination of his body and mental power to overcome it.\n\nOn this Continent of Gods, without any supplies, Nian Bing was completely unfamiliar with everything here. However, for the sake of survival, the fighting spirit in his heart had risen to its peak. When Kaao told him to cross mountains to fetch medicine, he had already understood that he would not only face the various magical beasts on the Continent of Gods but also the gods of the Continent of Gods. As an outsider, people here likely would not accept him, let alone the fact that he was now a undead creature.\n\nWithout the aura of life, although the surrounding environment was much harsher than the realm of life, Nian Bing actually felt much more comfortable. The unstable magical elements in the air were fluctuating, but relying solely on the released death aura, he could easily resist them, which was much more comfortable than the oppression of life essence.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Nian Bing looked back. The golden passage had already closed. Kaao's voice, which seemed to never change, rang out, \"Follow the direction indicated by the passage. Remember my description. Return immediately after obtaining the three fruits, without delay. No matter what dangers you encounter, you can only rely on yourself. I will remind you, the closer you get to your destination, the stronger the creatures you will face. Whether they are gods or demons, you will have to solve them with your own strength.\"\n\nKaao's voice disappeared. Nian Bing did not rush to act. He looked up at the overcast sky, took a deep breath, stood in place, and extended his mental power to the surrounding twenty zhang. He sensed all changes in aura, and at the same time, by resisting the erosion of life essence, he could also allow his mental power to slowly recover in the silent space.\n\nHe stood in place for a full half-hour. Only when his mental power recovered to its peak state did Nian Bing look down at his gray skin, and a bitter smile appeared on his face. He had never imagined that one day he would be alive as an undead zombie and that he would have to rely on this method to seek his path to rebirth.\n\nTaking another deep breath, casting aside all distracting thoughts, and determining the direction of his advance with his mental power, Nian Bing leaped up without hesitation. His body transformed into a gray arrow in the air, flying rapidly towards the fixed direction.\n\nThe road was not smooth. To be precise, there was no road on this Continent of Gods. However, these were not enough to stop Nian Bing's progress. Each leverage allowed him to rebound more than ten zhang, moving forward like a leaping celestial body, continuously advancing. All that was needed was to find leverage points on the rugged terrain. In the distance, he already saw the first mountain.\n\nIt was a black mountain peak. The entire mountain was filled with a stifling aura. No plants grew on the mountain. The barren mountain body had many holes, which looked like they were caused by weathering, or perhaps man-made.\n\nJust as Nian Bing slowed down and increased his vigilance, a sharp shriek suddenly sounded. More than a dozen green figures burrowed out from the holes on the mountain and rushed towards him like lightning. Nian Bing's eyes lit up. Through the Heavenly Eye acupoint, he could clearly see these small green things; they were indeed green lizards! Facing such magical beasts, he no longer felt any fear. The light in his eyes shone brightly. Sensing their charging direction through the Heavenly Eye acupoint, his body suddenly stopped advancing, and he flashed rapidly in place, dodging the green lizards' first attack.\n\nAt the same time, Nian Bing was not just passively taking a beating. He also launched his own attacks. With the experience from last time, his movements were much faster this time. The Heavenly Eye acupoint flickered with a faint colorful light. His vast mental power formed an invisible domain around his body. The divine light in his eyes flickered. In just a brief moment of evasion, four green lizards turned into a sky full of bloody rain under his powerful mental power. While the physical defense of green lizards was strong, their mental power was negligible. Attacking them from the inside out was the best method to deal with them.\n\nA hint of bloodthirsty light appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. Stimulated by the blood, a sense of nausea rose in his heart. He knew this was the nature of a zombie. He did not reject such a nature. His body flashed, and using the skills he had honed while practicing his culinary arts in the past, he continuously and skillfully knocked away the remaining green lizards, then completely resolved them with his powerful mental power.\n\nIn just a few brief moments of evasion, Nian Bing already had eleven red cores in his hands. Without hesitation, he immediately ingested these essences of blood. The taste of blood stimulated his senses. As a zombie, this was undoubtedly the greatest enjoyment. After devouring the cores of more than ten green lizards, his gray body gradually exuded a faint blood aura. The feeling of power made him roar up to the sky. With a casual claw strike, he left a clear mark on the incredibly solid black mountain rock.",

    "content": "As the Dragon God had said, everything on this Divine Continent was different from the Radiant Continent. Not only were the divine beings here far more powerful than ordinary humans, but even the rocks, tempered by the harsh environment, were tens of times harder than ordinary rocks. On the Radiant Continent, a single blow like this would have flattened even a small hill.\n\nNian Bing now rather longed for the Green Lizard to reappear. After all, the pleasure of devouring such monster cores was the only comfortable thing he had felt since arriving on the Divine Continent. Moreover, this could also enhance his strength. With each increase in strength, his future journey would become smoother. The core of the Green Lizard stored the source of the lizard's energy, not life force, and absorbing it with a zombie's body meant he barely had to consider any negative side effects.\n\nHowever, reality did not unfold as he had imagined. Not a single Green Lizard appeared until Nian Bing reached the mountaintop. Standing on the high black mountain peak, Nian Bing could already see the second mountain, a mountain twice as high as the one he was on. The difference was that this mountain was entirely red, a dark red exuding a dark aura.\n\nAfter simply climbing one mountain, Nian Bing felt no sense of relief. He remained vigilant with his spiritual power while constantly observing his surroundings. Being in a foreign land and needing to fulfill his promises to his beloved women, he had to be cautious at all times. He knew his life no longer belonged entirely to himself. He still wanted to return and reunite with his beloved women, and he still wanted to rescue his parents. All of this, however, depended on his safe rebirth.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was preparing to continue his journey, his externally distributed spiritual power suddenly trembled violently. At the same time, he heard a dull thunderclap. Shortly after the thunder, a dazzling lightning bolt flashed across the sky, followed by dense thunderclaps. It seemed the entire Divine Continent was trembling in this dense thunder.\n\nWhat surprised Nian Bing even more was the rapid fluctuation of the already unstable magical elements in the air. These were not regular fluctuations but violent ones. Each fluctuation seemed to distort space. Nian Bing's spiritual power, which had been spread twenty feet outside his body, was compressed within his body in just a few blinks of an eye.\n\nIn an instant, Nian Bing suddenly remembered something and understood why he had been able to ascend to the top of the first mountain so easily without encountering much obstruction.\n\nNot long ago, when he and the Dragon God had first arrived on the Divine Continent, the Dragon God had told him that magical storms could occur at any time on this Divine Continent. Under the baptism of magical storms, even divine beings would find it difficult to withstand them. Given the current situation, he probably had very good luck and encountered a magical storm as soon as he arrived.\n\nAs soon as he understood what was about to happen, Nian Bing reacted without hesitation. He ducked down and quickly burrowed between two tall rock formations. He didn't want to stand on the mountaintop and become a lightning rod. The power of lightning strikes was immensely destructive to a zombie. He practically sprinted and threw himself into those two rocks. The moment he left, Nian Bing felt a tingling sensation behind him, and the surroundings seemed to flash. A powerful impact suddenly appeared, temporarily deafening him. The spot where he had just stood was already scorched black. Of course, the mountain itself was black, so the traces of the lightning strike were not obvious, but a crater with a diameter of nearly ten feet made Nian Bing feel fortunate.\n\nThe fluctuations of magical elements in the air intensified. To conserve his strength, Nian Bing carefully retracted his spiritual power to the surface of his skin, curling his entire body into a ball to minimize the area of his body exposed to the outside air. He did not know if he could withstand the impending magical storm, but he could only try. At the very least, waiting to die would never be an option for him.\n\nWhile covering his head with his hands to resist the raging magical elements in the air, Nian Bing cautiously observed his surroundings. He felt fortunate that he had chosen to hide between two hard black rocks. Both rocks were massive, like small hills, and stood over thirty feet tall. Looking up from below, he could only see the dark clouds constantly changing due to the lightning. Here, the fluctuation of magical elements in the air was clearly not as strong as outside; most of the magical energy fluctuations were blocked by the rocks.\n\nHe secretly breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that all he had to do was wait. He only hoped that the magical storm would not last too long. Having just consumed the cores of over ten Green Lizards, he was not worried about his death energy being depleted. Those cores were great tonics for him. Now, he just needed to wait. His spiritual power was not greatly consumed, giving him enough time to recover.\n\nJust then, Nian Bing's spiritual power moved. He saw that under the rocks not far in front of him, there was a small hole about three feet in diameter. A head emerged from the hole, and its gaze met his.\n\n\"Ah! Who are you?\" The voice was somewhat stiff and sounded strange, but it was human language that Nian Bing could understand. It was a short, male human. It was difficult to tell his age from his appearance, as more than two-thirds of his not-so-small face was covered by curly, brown facial hair. His eyes were also brown. He was somewhat surprised to see Nian Bing, but not intensely so. Nian Bing saw strong hostility in his eyes.\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Hello, are you a divine being here?\"\n\nThe short man snorted and said, \"Damn it, what divine being? I'm a dwarf, not a divine being. Why are you, a divine being, coming to our dwarf territory? Do you want to challenge the dignity of us dwarves? Your smell is truly disgusting. Humph, you're just a low-level human. If it weren't for the impending magical storm, I would have sent you to hell just for destroying our food earlier. Hurry up and leave. If you pollute our sacred mountain any further, I'll make you pay.\"\n\nLooking at the dwarf's furious demeanor, Nian Bing frowned and said, \"Dwarf, I've heard of your race. It seems to be a race from the forgotten continent. Judging by your appearance, you are indeed short. I have no ill intentions. There's a magical storm outside now. Even if I wanted to go out, I couldn't. I don't have the confidence to withstand the magical storm with my body.\"\n\nThe dwarf snorted angrily and said, \"No matter what your reason, you cannot stay here. Wait. Hold on, you actually mentioned the forgotten continent just now. My heavens! Are you not one of the divine beings?\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment and asked, \"Why do you say that? Don't I look like one?\"\n\n\"Of course, you don't quite look like one. You are an undead, but you don't seem to be one of those divine beings' undead, because the four words 'forgotten continent' are a forbidden phrase among divine beings. They would never mention it lightly. Where exactly did you come from?\" The dwarf's gaze towards Nian Bing was no longer filled with hostility, but rather with a hint of curiosity.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"I came from a faraway place. As you said, I am not a divine being. Of course, don't ask me where I came from, and don't ask who brought me here. I can only tell you that I am a human, a pure human. Although I am in the body of an undead, I am still human.\"\n\nThe dwarf looked at Nian Bing and said, \"How can you prove you are not a divine being?\"\n\nWith a loud boom, the entire mountain peak trembled violently. The fluctuation of magical elements in the air became even more intense. Nian Bing felt his entire body tighten and quickly enhanced his spiritual power to protect himself, enabling him to resist the raging magical elements around him. The dwarf's words were interrupted by this thunderous clap. A layer of black light emanated from his body. This was not the black of darkness, but a kind of ability similar to battle qi, forcibly protecting his body from being invaded by the magical storm.\n\nNian Bing said, \"How can I prove it? If I prove I am not a divine being, will you accept me?\"\n\nThe dwarf said, \"Of course. We dwarves only have enmity with those divine beings. We have no enmity with ordinary humans. Moreover, the tradition of us dwarves is always to be hospitable.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Alright, since I've just arrived here, I also hope to have new friends. Consider these items as a welcome gift.\" As he spoke, he waved his left hand and, with the guidance of his spiritual power, took out several flatbreads from his spatial ring. As a chef, Nian Bing always stored a large amount of food and ingredients for cooking in his spatial ring. The biggest advantage after the spatial ring evolved was its preservation function. Even if there was a lot of food, it would not spoil in the spatial ring. Before becoming a zombie, he and Bing Yun had lived in a cave for an unknown period. Before that incident, he had just made a big purchase in Ice Moon City. Now that he had become a zombie, he couldn't eat them himself, but he had always carried them with him.\n\nSeeing the flatbreads suddenly, the dwarf was stunned for a moment, and then he let out a low exclamation. His short body shot out of the hole, and he snatched the flatbreads from Nian Bing's hand. He didn't eat them, but instead, he brought them to his nose and sniffed them vigorously, savoring the aroma of the bread. His grayish-black face was filled with an expression of intoxication, and his beard trembled constantly, indicating his excitement.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and asked, \"Are these enough to prove my identity?\"\n\n\"Enough, of course, they are enough. You must have come from the Radiant Continent, right? Although I don't know how you broke through the seal to reach the Divine Continent, I can be sure that you must have come from the Radiant Continent. Since our homeland was sent to another world by those monsters, only the Radiant Continent would have such legendary flatbreads. This is legendary food! I never expected to have the fortune to see it. Human brother, it's great to meet you. I am a warrior of the dwarf race, my name is Xi Lu. You can just call me by my name from now on.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Hello, my name is Nian Bing. Xi Lu, can I take shelter here from the magical storm now?\"\n\nXi Lu only then came to his senses and quickly said, \"No, of course not. My friend, you have given me such precious things, how can I let you hide from the magical storm here? Judging by the thunder today, the effect of this magical storm will likely last for a long time and be very powerful. Come, come to my home. There, you will not be harmed by any magical storm.\" With that, he flashed and arrived outside the cave. The hard and heavy rocks seemed like straw in his hands. He pointed to the hole below, signaling Nian Bing to drill in.\n\nNian Bing hesitated for a moment. After all, this was his first encounter with dwarves, and he naturally had some reservations. However, when he saw the sincere light in the eyes of the dwarf warrior Xi Lu again, he no longer hesitated and immediately flashed into the hole.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing enter the hole, Xi Lu quickly followed him down, covering the rocks above. Just as Xi Lu had said, as soon as they entered the hole, the magical storm outside could no longer affect them. It was pitch black around them, but there was no sense of stuffiness. After they turned a corner, gemstones emitting a faint yellow light were placed at intervals along the stone walls of the hole for illumination. However, what made Nian Bing feel a bit awkward was that the hole was too low. He could only advance by crouching, while Xi Lu, who was only waist-high, moved as if he were in his element, constantly flipping the flatbreads in his hands, appearing extremely excited.\n\nNian Bing couldn't help but ask, \"Brother Xi Lu, since you like these flatbreads so much, why don't you try them? Although I've kept them in my spatial ring for some time, I can guarantee that they are not spoiled at all. They still taste very good.\" Although these flatbreads were not made by Nian Bing himself, with his culinary skills, the ones he chose were the best from Ice Moon City.\n\nXi Lu's beard twitched. Under the dim yellow light from the cave walls, Nian Bing seemed to see him smiling foolishly. Xi Lu said, \"Precisely because these flatbreads are too good, I'm reluctant to eat them! I want my mother to eat them first. She must also miss this kind of food from our legendary homeland, right?\"\n\nIf Nian Bing had had any lingering doubts about Xi Lu earlier, those doubts vanished at this moment. The kind of person Nian Bing most admired and liked was a filial person. He had not been with his parents since childhood, and not being able to serve them was his greatest regret. Upon hearing Xi Lu say this, his affection for this potential adversary greatly increased.",

    "content": "Now that they were closer and he didn't have to divert his attention to resist the magic storm, Nian Bing could properly observe the dwarf before him. He opened his Heavenly Eye acupoint, enhancing his spiritual power. Although the cavern was dimly lit, it didn't affect his vision.\n\nThe dwarf before him was only about 1.2 meters tall, with a large head. Perhaps it was due to his abundant beard, but despite his short stature, he gave off a very solid impression. His exposed arms were corded with muscle, exceptionally thick. He wore what appeared to be clothing made from animal hide. While Nian Bing didn't believe it was ordinary animal hide, the leather on Wu Lu was exceptionally fine, without even the slightest seam visible. The entire garment seemed naturally formed, as if it were one piece. Nian Bing hadn't expected to find such exquisite clothing in a place like the Divine Continent.\n\n\"Brother Nian Bing, come, I'll take you to see my mother and my kin. We dwarves have lived in this Sacred Mountain for over ten thousand years! If they know you've brought the legendary flatbread, they'll surely regard you as a benefactor! I never imagined that in my lifetime, I, Wu Lu, would see something like home.\" As he spoke, he strode deeper into the cave. This was tough for Nian Bing. Although his body had been greatly modified, walking in a semi-crouched position was no easy task. Fortunately, his zombie body no longer felt muscle soreness, allowing him to barely keep up with Wu Lu's pace as they descended further into the cave.\n\nTo Nian Bing's great surprise, he saw no ventilation shafts in the cave. Yet, no matter how they walked, the air didn't feel stuffy. Was the air here purified? It was much more comfortable to breathe than the outside air, with its unstable fluctuations of magical elements. The cave tunnels were constructed very scientifically, with smooth walls and no imperfections. Staircases were arranged in a well-ordered manner, giving the impression of entering an underground palace. It was just that this underground palace was rather short.\n\nBased on Nian Bing's senses, Wu Lu finally stopped after they had walked to a depth within the mountain's core. The scenery before them had changed; it was no longer a simple path but a complex network of tunnels branching out in various directions. Since the tunnels appeared dense and there seemed to be many forks, Nian Bing thought that if he entered alone, it would be difficult to find his way out.\n\nWu Lu turned to Nian Bing and said, \"You look quite uncomfortable. Want to rest for a bit? It took our clan a great deal of effort to build this cave to its current scale. I dare say, aside from those four old fossils, no other place on the Divine Continent is as comfortable as our cave.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"The four people you're referring to are probably the so-called Four True Gods.\"\n\nWu Lu snorted and replied, \"Who else could it be? Those four guys, relying on their immense strength, do whatever they please. If not for them, how would we have lost our homeland?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"From what you're saying, you seem to miss the Lost Empire greatly. As a descendant of those involved, you must be very clear about what happened back then. Although I know some things, I'm sure not as much as you do.\"\n\nWu Lu sat down in an adjacent tunnel and took out a piece of cloth from his pocket, wrapping the flatbreads. Then, he said with a sigh, \"Of course I know what happened. Our dwarf race has very detailed records. The War of the Gods was initiated by those so-called High Gods. They feared our Lost Empire would become too powerful and no longer be under their control. At that time, they were indeed no longer our match. If not for those last few old fellows using their immense power to move the entire Lost Continent into another dimension, perhaps the so-called gods of the Divine Continent would have already vanished.\" As he spoke, a look of intense hatred flickered in his eyes.\n\nNian Bing was greatly surprised and asked, \"Then, that means your ancestors should not have been on the Divine Continent before the War of the Gods began? How did your ancestors end up here and not disappear with the Lost Continent?\"\n\nWu Lu sighed heavily and said, \"That great war wasn't just fought on the territory of our Lost Empire. In order to completely annihilate the beings who enslaved us on the Divine Continent, the Forgotten Empire dispatched our strongest New Human legions, secretly entering the Divine Continent. They were led by twelve heroes, whose mission was to destroy the foundation of the Divine Continent, severing the roots of the gods who entered the Lost Continent.\"\n\nNian Bing understood and said, \"That was indeed a good plan. I assume the Lost Continent didn't know about the existence of True Gods at that time, right?\"\n\nWu Lu said helplessly, \"Yes, at that time, no one knew of the existence of True Gods. Therefore, these few hundred, but the most elite heroes of the Forgotten Empire, secretly set foot on the land of the Divine Continent. To no longer be enslaved, their hearts were filled with courage, and they launched a merciless slaughter against their enemies.\"\n\n\"What happened afterwards? If they had truly struck the weak point of the Divine Continent, those four True Gods wouldn't have stood by and watched, would they?\"\n\nWu Lu replied, \"It was precisely because of that operation that the Lost Empire truly lost its opportunity. Who could have predicted beforehand that there were such powerful beings on this continent? No one knows where those four True Gods came from. The number of High Gods, Demi-gods, and other such beings left behind on the Divine Continent was not large. Under the elite attack, their residual forces were quickly cornered. Just then, these True Gods appeared. They ordered the twelve heroes of the Forgotten Empire in a commanding tone, ordering them to immediately leave the land of the Divine Continent and never return. Having expended so much effort to reach that point, even though the twelve heroes felt the immense power of the enemies before them, why would they retreat? They chose to fight. But it was then that they realized what true power was, what the power of gods was.\"\n\nAs he said this, Wu Lu's face showed a hint of terror. Although he knew this was from historical records, these memories had clearly left a profound impression on him. \"Death, a death like moths flying into a flame. Even if the twelve strongest heroes joined forces, they couldn't inflict even the slightest harm on those True Gods. In just over a dozen breaths, more than half of the remaining two hundred-plus warriors of the Forgotten Empire had perished, while those True Gods seemed as if they hadn't moved at all, still looking at them with indifferent eyes.\"\n\nThe vivid memories strongly shook Wu Lu's inner terror. Nian Bing couldn't help but ask, \"How did the twelve heroes of the Forgotten Empire compare in strength to the High Gods of the Divine Continent?\"\n\nWu Lu stated, \"Facing any one of the twelve heroes, a High God could easily win. Facing two, they could barely win. Facing three, they could at best fight to a draw. And facing four, the so-called High God would surely die. What's more, our great twelve heroes came to the Divine Continent with the determination to die; they would never retreat, ever.\"\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath. The disparity in strength was so great. Judging by Wu Lu's words, perhaps a single True God could easily destroy several High God-level beings. This was no mere difference; it was a gap in realms, with no possibility of resistance! \"What happened next? Did all the warriors of the Forgotten Empire die?\"\n\nWu Lu shook his head. \"There are four True Gods on the Divine Continent, and only three of them made their move at that time. Just as those True Gods were about to completely annihilate our Forgotten Empire's warriors, another True God who had remained silent spoke. He stopped the actions of the other True Gods and once again ordered us to leave, telling us it was our final chance. Strangely, the other three True Gods seemed very wary of him and did not object to his intervention. At this point, only three heroes remained among the twelve. They did not continue to sacrifice themselves. They all knew that with the sudden appearance of such powerful beings on the Divine Continent, the most correct choice was to quickly relay the message back. Thus, the great heroes made a strategic retreat. And one of the remaining three heroes was Umo, the strongest warrior of our dwarf race. He is also my ancestor.\" As he said this, the short Wu Lu straightened his chest, his eyes filled with pride.\n\nNian Bing pondered, \"So the reason you dwarves stayed here was probably to monitor the situation, right?\"\n\nWu Lu gave Nian Bing a thumbs-up and said, \"Brother, you are truly intelligent. Our dwarf hero Umo decided to lead the remaining dozens of our kin to stay behind, not to fight, but solely to monitor. The enemy was too powerful; only by better understanding the enemy's movements could we have a chance of victory. Thus, we remained on the Divine Continent. What happened next, you might already know. When the war on the Lost Continent was nearing its end, no one knows by what means those High Gods and deities managed to persuade those three True Gods to attack our homeland. At that time, the sky cracked, the earth collapsed, everything changed, becoming so illusory. We watched from this enemy land as our country simply disappeared, completely vanished. Can you imagine what kind of feeling we had at that time?\" His face became agitated, and his brown eyes were already a little red.\n\nNian Bing sighed and asked, \"So you survived on this continent afterwards? Did those High Gods and deities not discover your existence?\"\n\nWu Lu shook his head. \"It wasn't that simple. Those scoundrels wouldn't let us go. How could they allow the dwarves, who were once the backbone of the Lost Empire, to remain? After the world changed and everything returned to calm, the environment of the Divine Continent became even harsher. It was then that the remnants of the Divine Continent, perhaps thinking we might remain, began to search for us everywhere. In the beginning, we relied on the dwarves' unique sense of terrain to evade wave after wave of searches. However, soon after, the magic storm appeared. Although there had been magic storms on the original Divine Continent, the one that appeared then was much stronger than before. Of our meager seventy-four kin, as many as twenty disappeared in that magic storm, completely vanished. And after the storm ended, those who survived also suffered no small injuries. To make matters worse, it was at this time that the remnants of the Divine Continent found traces of our kin and attacked.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart grew alarmed and he said, \"Then your ancestors must have faced a desperate situation.\" Just as Wu Lu said, under those circumstances, they had almost no chance of survival.\n\nWu Lu shook his head and said, \"Originally, that was the case. But our fate was changed by one person. This person is also the only one our dwarf race in the Divine Continent is grateful for. He is the True God who stopped the other three True Gods from harming our Forgotten Empire's warriors. In the hearts of our dwarf race, only he is worthy of the title of god.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment and his heart stirred as he asked, \"The god you are referring to might be the God of Life, Kao, couldn't it?\"\n\nWu Lu stared blankly at Nian Bing and said, \"How did you know? You can guess that?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"You said a True God saved you, and this mountain where you live is so close to Kao's Realm of Life. It's most likely that she saved you. If it really was her, then she did not participate in moving the Lost Empire to another dimension back then.\"\n\nA look of reverence appeared in Wu Lu's eyes. \"Of course. How would the God of Life do such a despicable thing? Brother Nian Bing, have you considered one question? Since the other three True Gods had the ability to move the Lost Continent away, they also had the ability to destroy it. Moving it away would probably be more difficult than destruction, wouldn't it?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart trembled and he said, \"Are you implying that it was because of Kao that the Lost Continent was merely sent to another dimension and not destroyed?\"\n\nWu Lu nodded and said, \"That is indeed the case. Although the records in our clan's history are not detailed, all signs indicate that it was precisely because of this reason that our Lost Continent had an extremely slim chance. Otherwise, the other three True Gods would not have needed to expend extra effort to send our country elsewhere. Simple destruction would have been easier, wouldn't it?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded in agreement. \"What you said makes a lot of sense. Now I understand a little better.\"",

    "content": "Although he didn't feel KAO was that kind himself, hearing what XI LU said, it seemed that it was precisely because of the existence of the Upper Body that the Guang Continent always remained as it was, and the Forgotten Continent was not truly destroyed. He didn't understand why, but if everything was like this, then he had indeed misjudged KAO. The God of Life's title was truly deserved!\n\nXI LU said, \"Brother, let's go. When I talk about the past, I can't help but ramble a bit. Oh, right, why did you come to the Divine Continent? And how did you pass through the barrier to enter the Divine Continent?\"\n\nXI LU stood up, and NIAN BING returned to his squatting position. Led by XI LU, he walked into a cave. As they walked, he answered XI LU's question, \"I am indeed from the Guang Continent, but I am human, and a human magician. I became like this because I used a powerful magic beyond my level, which excessively consumed my life force. With the help of a friend, I managed to maintain my sanity through zombie magic, but now I am like a walking dead, no longer considered human. I don't want to lie to you, I cannot tell you the process of coming to the Divine Continent. I came here to be cured. The one who can help me recover my life force and be reborn as a human is the God of Life KAO you just mentioned.\"\n\nUpon hearing NIAN BING's words, XI LU stopped abruptly and said excitedly, \"Then, according to you, you must have already met Master KAO? What, what does she look like?\"\n\nNIAN BING smiled slightly and said, \"I can't say what she looks like, but her abilities are indeed the strongest among those I've met. She told me that if I want to recover my life force, I must find some fruits, which is why I passed through your territory. Oh, right, you still haven't told me how KAO saved you back then?\"\n\nXI LU said, \"The situation was very chaotic then. Just as our tribes were preparing to fight to the death, Master KAO appeared. She ordered no one to attack us anymore, and at the same time, she ordered my ancestors not to leave this mountain peak. That's how it was resolved, very simple, right?\"\n\n\"With just a word, all the main gods obeyed. It's indeed simple!\" NIAN BING took a deep breath. He deeply understood that formidable strength was the true right to speak, otherwise, why would those main gods listen to KAO?\n\nXI LU said, \"Brother NIAN BING, where are you going to find the fruits? Since it was Great God KAO who asked you to look, perhaps I can help you.\"\n\nNIAN BING was overjoyed and said, \"That would be great! I'm not familiar with the Divine Continent. With your help, I think everything will definitely be much simpler. KAO said that I should follow the direction she pointed, cross three great mountains, and then behind the last mountain, find a waterfall. What I'm looking for is behind the waterfall.\"\n\nXI LU's eyes showed horror, \"No way, the waterfall behind three mountains, isn't that the God of Death Waterfall?\"\n\nNIAN BING was stunned for a moment, \"God of Death Waterfall? Do you mean there's a guy calling himself the God of Death living in that waterfall?\" Thinking of this possibility, NIAN BING couldn't help but bitterly smile. KAO really thought highly of him, asking him to face a main god-level expert. Let alone now, even in his prime, he would never succeed.\n\nXI LU shook his head and said, \"No, no one lived there back then. The reason it's called the God of Death Waterfall is that even gods will die there.\"\n\nNIAN BING looked at him, surprised, \"No way, that's the explanation? Is there anything special about that place?\"\n\nXI LU said, \"I've been to that place once, and it's indeed very special. The color of the waterfall is black. Let alone going behind the waterfall, just being within a hundred zhang¹ of the small lake below the waterfall, the body will be corroded by strong death energy. It is said that a mysterious divine person once touched a drop of water from the waterfall, and his body was immediately completely enveloped by the vast death energy within the waterfall. He couldn't hold on for long before he also turned into the same black liquid as the lake water. Tell me, isn't it powerful?\"\n\nDeath energy? NIAN BING frowned. He was certainly not scared by XI LU's description, but he had made some other judgments. If it was as XI LU said, then he could really try to brave the God of Death Waterfall. He himself was a zombie, so death energy, which was a great harm to others, might be a tonic for him.\n\nJust then, they had reached the end of the passage. It suddenly opened up in front of them, and NIAN BING no longer had to walk hunched over. Although the stone room in the mountain was still not enough for him to stand upright, he could barely stand by lowering his head.\n\n\"Mom, I'm back.\" As soon as XI LU entered the stone room, he shouted impatiently.\n\nNIAN BING followed XI LU into the stone room. The furnishings in the stone room were simple: two small stone beds, a stone table, and some simple tools on the ground. An old woman sat on one of the stone beds. She looked a bit shorter than XI LU. As soon as she saw XI LU enter, a soft light immediately appeared in her eyes. She had no beard, but her face was full of wrinkles. The vicissitudes of time had left deep marks on her. Her hair had turned silver-white. However, she had a pair of clear eyes. When she saw her son, a gentle smile couldn't help but appear in her eyes. But when her gaze fell on NIAN BING, it froze. \"XI LU, why did you bring a divine person back?\" She seemed a bit surprised but showed no fear. She agilely jumped off the bed, reached under the bed, and pulled out a short axe.\n\nThe short axe had a peculiar appearance. It was cast from some unknown metal. The axe body was black, and the axe handle was carved with fine and complex patterns. NIAN BING could clearly feel strong energy fluctuations from the short axe. The blade did not shimmer with a cold light, still as dark as ever, but NIAN BING felt a strong pressure from the axe. It was indeed a good weapon, probably not much worse than artifact-level.\n\nXI LU was startled by his mother's appearance and quickly stepped forward to grab her hand. \"Mom, don't misunderstand. Brother NIAN BING is not a divine person. He just came from the Guang Continent to be cured in the Divine Continent.\" While speaking, he explained how he and NIAN BING met. NIAN BING also learned from his explanation that his encounter with XI LU was not accidental. When he killed those green lizards, it had attracted XI LU, who was responsible for patrolling the Holy Mountain. It just so happened that a magic storm occurred, and XI LU came out of the cave, which led to him meeting NIAN BING.\n\nAfter hearing XI LU's words, his mother finally calmed down. However, when she saw the flatbread XI LU took out from his embrace, she immediately became excited again. However, this time it was excited excitement.\n\n\"Bread, it's really bread, it's actually bread! I never expected to see this legendary flatbread in my lifetime.\" Her excitement was even stronger than XI LU's. Her small body trembled constantly, her eyes only on those flatbreads.\n\nNIAN BING secretly sighed. Flatbread, which was nothing in the Guang Continent, had become such a precious thing in the Divine Continent. The Divine Continent was indeed a hellish place!\n\n\"Hello, Auntie. Consider this bread as my gift to you. I am very happy to be your friend.\"\n\nXI LU's mother looked up and said, \"Call me Auntie LADA. Thank you for letting us feel the sense of home. The reason we dwarves here can survive is that we firmly believe that one day, our country will return. We have survived generation after generation, supported by this belief. Otherwise, our tribe would have long since disappeared. I have a premonition that these flatbreads signify that our light is about to arrive, and our homeland might be returning.\"\n\nLooking at LADA's appearance, NIAN BING's heart became a little confused. Previously, he had sacrificed his life to protect those bottles of MOODAUS seals, but now, seeing LADA, he didn't know if what he did was correct, as the outcome was hard to predict. But for LADA and these dwarves, and the people of the original Lost Continent, it was definitely a good thing.\n\nXI LU said, \"Mom, quickly taste this flatbread. I can't stand eating green lizards every day anymore.\"\n\nLADA's expression sank, \"You scoundrel, how did I educate you? Have you forgotten? I told you, when you have good things, you should think of others first. If all our tribes only thought of themselves, we would have long since been destroyed in this mountain. Only by helping each other can we all persevere until the day our country returns.\"\n\nXI LU's expression changed, and he quickly said, \"Yes, Mom, I know I was wrong.\"\n\nLooking at this mother and son, NIAN BING was deeply moved and quickly said, \"Auntie, you don't have to be like this. I have some food from the Guang Continent in my spatial ring. Since you need it, I'll give it to you.\"\n\nXI LU's eyes showed a hint of joy, but it quickly disappeared. \"How can you give it all to us? You need to eat too. You know, in the Divine Continent, food is the most precious thing. Wow, I'm sorry, I forgot you don't need food anymore.\" Saying this, a look of shame appeared on his face.\n\nNIAN BING gave a wry smile and said, \"Actually, sometimes even I forget. It's not your fault. It's a pity that I can't use magic now, and this is a confined space. Otherwise, I could make some delicacies from the Guang Continent for you to taste.\"\n\nXI LU's eyes lit up and said, \"Who says we can't make a fire? Although this is a confined space, we dwarves are best at construction. Let alone making a fire, we can do anything we can do outside. Brother NIAN BING, are you tired? If you're not tired, I want to see what you make right now.\"\n\nNIAN BING smiled and said, \"I'm not tired. Let's do it now. I think what I make will satisfy you. I wonder if your ancestors' records mention the profession of chef.\"\n\nXI LU looked at NIAN BING blankly, obviously having never heard of these two words. LADA hesitated and said, \"I think I heard my mother mention it. Chef is a very sacred profession, responsible for making food.\"\n\nNIAN BING smiled slightly and said, \"Yes, the process of making food by chefs is called cooking, and I am a real chef. Auntie, I will make some simple food for you to taste now. I wonder how many of your tribesmen you have. Why don't you invite them all to come together, so it can be lively?\"\n\nLADA smiled and said, \"Young man, you have a kind heart. I thank you on behalf of the dwarf tribesmen. XI LU, go and call everyone here.\"\n\nXI LU's face was full of excitement, and he quickly agreed and ran out. Watching his son leave, LADA's eyes showed the same tenderness as before. \"NIAN BING, come, sit down. You are tall, and it must be very uncomfortable standing here.\"\n\nNIAN BING sighed softly and said, \"I wish I could feel uncomfortable now, but unfortunately, after becoming a zombie, I've lost all feeling. Auntie, I have poison on me. Do you have gloves? I'll need them when I make food for you later.\"\n\nLADA shook her head and said, \"No need. In this Divine Continent, there is no place that is not poisonous. Through constant evolution, we are no longer the dwarves of the past. Let alone us, any divine person or creature on this continent is not afraid of toxins. Zombie poison is nothing.\"\n\nNIAN BING nodded and said, \"I see, then I can rest assured.\"\n\nLADA said, \"NIAN BING, are you planning to go to the God of Death Waterfall after leaving here? XI LU should have told you that it is a very dangerous place.\"\n\nNIAN BING nodded and said, \"No matter how dangerous it is, I must try it. This is my only chance. Moreover, I am a zombie myself, so death energy may not be useful to me.\"\n\nLADA said, \"Perhaps. NIAN BING, I want to ask you for a favor, can you?\"\n\nNIAN BING was stunned and said, \"A favor? Auntie, please tell me. As long as I can do it, I will do my best to help you.\" He could feel the deep affection between LADA and XI LU. He was willing to help LADA without any ulterior motive.",

    "content": "Rada smiled slightly and said, \"You truly are a kind human. Although I don't know why you came here, I suspect that if you could come, you might not necessarily have the ability to return. If you can recover your vitality and wish to return to the Yangguang Continent, may I ask if you would take Xilu with you?\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Rada in surprise. Although he guessed that Rada's request might not be easy to fulfill, he hadn't expected it to be so difficult. A hint of hesitation appeared in his eyes. \"Auntie, Xilu is your only child, isn't he? If he leaves, then you...\"\n\nRada shook her head. \"Don't worry about me. I'm fine. We dwarves have long lives. Although not as long as those demigods and above among humans, we can still live to around twelve hundred years old. I am already thirteen hundred years old this year; I am long overdue to die. Xilu, however, is only three hundred years old, which is like a young man in his twenties among your humans. Therefore, I don't want him to remain in this hopeless place.\"\n\nNian Bing furrowed his brow slightly. \"Auntie, didn't you just say that the dwarves who remain here live for their beliefs?\"\n\nRada smiled self-deprecatingly. \"For beliefs? Yes! For beliefs. Without beliefs, perhaps those of us who remain here would have perished long ago. The reason I told Xilu about the past glory of our dwarven race was to make him a heroic dwarf who stands tall. But, can a dwarf who is forever holed up in a cave become a hero? Your arrival is an opportunity for us. I don't want my child to remain here, living a thousand years of lonely life like me. I want him to go out and see the world. Perhaps you think my request is abrupt, but do you know? The remaining dwarves, including Xilu and myself, are only seven in total. Among us seven, Xilu is the only one in his prime, and I am the only female left. This means we cannot reproduce. If this continues, the only outcome will be extinction. Xilu has a chance only by leaving here!\"\n\nNian Bing finally understood Rada's meaning and nodded gently. \"Auntie, I understand what needs to be done. If I can survive and have the chance to leave here alive, then I will definitely take Xilu. As long as I am alive, I will protect him.\"\n\nRada smiled slightly. \"Protection is not necessary. As a descendant of the dwarven hero Ximo, Xilu is fully capable of protecting himself. Thank you, Nian Bing. Although it is only a promise, I believe you can fulfill it. You can state any request you have. As long as we can fulfill it, we will satisfy you. Oh, perhaps you don't know, but we dwarves are naturally the best blacksmiths. Having lived in this mountain for tens of thousands of years, we could only research forging when we were bored. I believe that even if our homeland returned to this world, there would be no one more skilled at forging than us remaining elders. We can forge better things.\"\n\nFaced with temptation, Nian Bing simply smiled and shook his head. \"Auntie, I am helping you without any conditions and without needing any requests. If you have any good equipment or items, please leave them for Xilu. I think these things will be more useful to him.\"\n\nRada was stunned for a moment. \"Nian Bing, perhaps you don't understand how precious the items we dwarves forge in large quantities are. With our current craftsmanship, anything forged with our full heart can absolutely be considered a divine artifact. Don't you wish to obtain it? This is what you deserve.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head. \"I consider Xilu a friend and you an elder. Since we are friends, helping each other is only natural. If I accepted your items, it would become an employer-employee relationship. Our friendship would no longer be pure. I don't need anything. I believe that any external objects will not have much effect on cultivation; rather, they might have a counterproductive effect. Only by continuously strengthening one's own cultivation can one become stronger, isn't that so?\"\n\n\"Good, to understand this principle means you have the potential to become stronger. You are indeed a good human lad, no wonder Xilu praises you so highly. However, if you can control your mind and have good weapons to assist you during continuous cultivation, it will further benefit the improvement of your strength. Quick, Elder Sister Rada, let me see what that legendary large pancake looks like.\" As he spoke, a group of six people walked in from outside.\n\nFrom their appearance, Nian Bing could only discern the age differences of the six. As Rada had mentioned, these six were all male. Apart from Xilu, three of the other five had completely white hair like Rada, while the remaining two had disheveled, graying hair. What they all had in common was a messy, curly beard, and the clothes they wore were made of animal scales, with exquisite designs.\n\nRada smiled and handed over the large pancake she was holding. An elder dwarf who walked at the forefront took it. Upon seeing the legendary large pancake, the five elderly dwarves also became excited like Rada. They looked at it, smelled it, and continuously discussed it.\n\nXilu chuckled and whispered to Nian Bing, \"Brother, these are all the elders of my clan. The magician who just spoke is Uncle Xirong, whose seniority in the clan is second only to my mother. Speaking of which, after so many generations of inheritance, our clansmen here are all relatives. There are only seven of us dwarves left now. You and my mother were talking just now, and it seemed you were chatting very warmly.\"\n\nNian Bing glanced at Rada and smiled. \"It's nothing. Auntie Rada was just telling me how skilled you dwarves are in smelting.\" Hearing Xilu's words, he gradually understood that inbreeding was not a good thing. Even with this mountain as their base, these dwarves had been marrying each other to reproduce, which would inevitably lead to problems, causing their numbers to dwindle.\n\nUpon hearing this, Xilu immediately puffed out his chest. \"Of course. Our dwarves are strongest in magic, smelting, forging, and crafting. You gave us this legendary large pancake, how about I give you a piece of clothing? On this Divine Continent, there are indeed many powerful magical beasts. Their own defense is strong, mainly due to the scales on their bodies. If we obtain these scales and undergo special modification and refinement, they can become excellent armor. I have quite a bit of material. I'll make you a piece later.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"There's no rush. Since you've all arrived, I'll cook for you first.\"\n\nUpon hearing that Nian Bing was going to cook for them, the dwarves immediately became excited. Those elderly dwarves held the large pancake and came to Nian Bing's side, waiting to see how he would prepare the delicious keepsake.\n\nNian Bing said to Xilu, \"You said you could start a fire earlier, so I'll entrust the task of starting the fire to you.\" As he spoke, he took out a large pot from his spatial ring and then took out several cooking utensils. Next, he took out a pile of bottles and jars of various seasonings and placed them on a nearby stone table.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing take out so many novel items, these dwarves, who were born on the Divine Continent, were immediately filled with curiosity. However, they were all too shy to get too close to look, but the hope in their eyes moved Nian Bing's heart for a long time. Without magic, he naturally couldn't make the best dishes, and he didn't intend to make the best. These dwarves were accustomed to eating monster meat. If they were suddenly to eat the most delicious food, they might not be able to handle it.\n\nWith this thought, Nian Bing took out two cabbages and placed them on the cutting board on the stone table. As soon as the cabbages appeared, the dwarves cried out again, all exclaiming, \"Could this be the legendary greens?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, took a few large pancakes, and began his cooking process. He did it very simply: he cut the cabbages into neat strips, with Xilu starting the fire, using the cabbages and pancakes as the main ingredients, and made a fried pancake for all the dwarves.\n\nXilu's method of starting a fire was peculiar. He placed a yellow crystal on the ground and, with a flick of his finger, flames erupted. The fire was very hot. If it were an ordinary chef, they would likely be uncomfortable with such high-temperature flames, but for Nian Bing, it was nothing. Soon, he began his cooking process.\n\n\"Wind's Whisper of Freedom,\" emitting a blue glow, appeared in Nian Bing's hand, instantly illuminating the stone chamber. Rada's eyes brightened. She didn't look at the knife; her gaze fell on the \"Wind Whisper Stone.\" Her eyes flickered, looking at Nian Bing, then at the precious stone, as if she were making some decision. The other dwarves also saw the \"Aotian Saber.\" They were equally surprised, but amidst their surprise, their gazes contained a hint of disdain and pity.\n\nOil, one of Nian Bing's most important cooking essentials he always carried with him. When the oil began to emit a fragrance in the pot, all the dwarves fell silent, sniffing the air vigorously as if afraid the aroma would suddenly disappear. Nian Bing's movements were quick. Three large plates of fried pancakes appeared on the stone table in no time.\n\nHe made a gesture of invitation. \"Come, esteemed dwarven elders, please taste my craftsmanship.\" Although it was just fried pancakes, and although Nian Bing had lost his human senses and couldn't even smell the flavors, as a top chef, how could what he made be ordinary?\n\nLooking at the golden pancake shreds and the emerald green cabbage, the dwarves swallowed their saliva in large gulps. However, none of them dared to move first.\n\nRada was the first to act. She smiled slightly and said, \"Come, don't let Nian Bing's good intentions go to waste.\" With that, she reached out first, grabbed a handful regardless of the fried pancake's temperature, and stuffed it into her mouth. When she moved, the other dwarves immediately followed. Nian Bing felt his vision blur as all the \"first enemies\" began to chew.\n\nThe dwarves' chewing process was very long, completely immersed in the enjoyment of the delicious food. Gradually, their faces were covered with tears. When they swallowed the fried pancakes, they all unexpectedly knelt down, prostrating themselves on the ground, murmuring indistinctly.\n\nAfter a long while, Rada led the dwarves to stand up again, wiped the tears from their faces, and looked deeply at Nian Bing. \"Thank you, Nian Bing. We will never forget the help you've given our dwarven race.\"\n\nNian Bing quickly said, \"Auntie, please don't be so polite. This is just a simple meal.\"\n\nRada's expression turned serious. \"Perhaps it is nothing to you, but to our dwarven race, these fried pancakes have a completely different meaning. Do you know, although we are dwarves, we were born and raised here. Our understanding of the outside world is limited to a few hundred miles around this holy mountain. We know from legends about our former homeland, but none of us has ever seen what our homeland looks like. We have all doubted and been apprehensive. It was our unyielding faith that supported us to live until now. This food is no longer just food; it tells us that everything truly exists. The Yangguang Continent exists, and our lost continent also exists! It gives us more confidence to live and more confidence to await the return of our homeland.\"\n\nNian Bing kept nodding. \"Auntie, I understand your meaning. I'm sorry, that was my mistake just now.\"\n\nRada shook her head. \"No, it's nothing. Come, my kinsmen, let us have a meal that resembles home-cooked food, and let us remember this taste forever and ever.\"",

    "content": "Four plates of fried flatbread vanished quickly under the rapid movements of seven dwarves, leaving no trace behind. They even licked the grease from the plates clean. Seeing this, Nian Bing felt no mockery in his heart. Instead, he respected these dwarves even more. Yes, just as they had said themselves, what sustained them and allowed them to persevere was their unyielding belief!\n\nAs the other dwarves departed, only Rada, her son, and the elderly dwarf named Xirong remained in the stone chamber.\n\nXirong said, \"The weather outside is very bad. The magic storm will likely not end for a few more days. This time, the lightning elemental explosion was very severe, even causing some degree of destruction to the outer areas of our Sacred Mountain. Nian Bing, it seems you'll have to stay with us for a while longer. You can only leave after the magic storm has passed. However, do you really intend to go to the Death God's Waterfall?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Even if the hope is slim, how will I know if it's impossible without trying? The Death God's Waterfall is where I must go, in order to survive.\"\n\nRada smiled. \"Well said. Nian Bing, I believe you will succeed. By the way, when you were cutting the flatbread earlier, I saw your knife. Could you show it to me again?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred. He quickly summoned the Whisper of the Free Wind – the Ao Tian Saber – from his spatial ring once more.\n\nA blue light illuminated the stone chamber brightly. None of the three dwarves in the room showed greed. Almost simultaneously, they all frowned. Xirong, in particular, glanced at the Ao Tian Saber, then at Nian Bing, and sighed heavily. \"What a waste of good material, Nian Bing! How did you forge this knife? Such a waste of resources.\"\n\nNian Bing was momentarily stunned. \"Waste? This knife was given to me by someone else; I didn't forge it myself. What, is the material not good? But I heard this knife was forged from the finest Lapis Lazuli, and the gem on the blade is also the best Wind Resonance Stone for the wind element!\"\n\nRada shook her head. \"You didn't understand his meaning. He's not saying your knife is bad, but that it was poorly forged. The materials for this knife are undoubtedly top-tier, but the forging method has significant problems. It simply did not fully unleash the blade's spirituality, nor could it make the Wind Resonance Stone perform to its fullest potential. Therefore, in your hands, it's merely a knife. I estimate it's performing at half its potential at most.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned. \"So, if this knife were reforged, it could become even better? But it's already a divine artifact; is there still room for further breakthroughs?\"\n\nXirong smiled. \"Nian Bing, it seems you truly know nothing about forging. This isn't just a matter of forging. Furthermore, divine artifacts are not necessarily the ultimate implements. In forging, just like in cultivation, there is no end. If these materials could be fully utilized, it could at least become a divine artifact. Unfortunately, that is very difficult now.\"\n\nThe words \"divine artifact\" immediately captivated Nian Bing. For a long time, his strength had largely come from his magic knives. If the power of his magic knives could be enhanced, his overall strength would undoubtedly increase significantly. Even his shadow puppets could reach a new level. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but ask, \"Senior Xirong, is there no other way? Can it not be modified?\"\n\nXirong quickly interjected, \"Nian Bing, this knife already has blood integrated with it; the various materials of the blade have completely fused. It's almost impossible to modify it. It's a shame such good materials don't even have a blade spirit. That's why I said it was a waste of good material earlier!\"\n\n\"Blade spirit? What is that?\" Nian Bing asked curiously.\n\nXirong replied, \"What is called a blade spirit refers to implements of divine artifact level or higher. If forged properly, they will develop their own soul. Only implements with a soul can be called true divine artifacts, or even divine artifacts.\"\n\nHearing his words, Nian Bing recalled what Cha Ji, a friend known as 'Little Broken Knife,' had said about the soul of a blade when they first met. It seemed to refer to the same thing. But his magic knives clearly possessed spirituality; why then did Xirong say his knives lacked a blade spirit?\n\nXirong explained, \"Nian Bing, our dwarven forging methods are very different from yours, humans. If I were to say our forging methods are the best, you might not be convinced. However, there's one thing I can tell you: only we dwarves have ever forged divine artifacts. Back then, it was precisely with the twelve divine artifacts forged by 167 of our master craftsmen sacrificing themselves that the Lost Empire gained the means to resist the Divine Continent. To forge true divine artifacts, one must forge with their own life essence. If these materials fell into my hands, perhaps I would truly risk my own life to try.\"\n\nNian Bing saw the burning excitement in Xirong's eyes. He was somewhat puzzled but quickly understood. Yes, as a blacksmith, what could be more exciting than forging the finest weapons? For the pursuit of their craft, life itself was no longer the most important thing. Understanding this, his respect for the dwarves before him deepened.\n\nXirong continued, \"It's a pity these knives lack a true soul, only spirituality. That's not enough. If a blade spirit could be cultivated from spirituality, modification might be possible, but success is uncertain.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"I have a few more knives here. They are both my kitchen knives and my former magic staffs. Meeting you now is quite a fortuitous encounter. Can you examine the forging level of these knives? If they can be slightly modified without any harm to you, that would be best.\" Since arriving on the Divine Continent, Nian Bing increasingly felt the inadequacy of his strength. While his own cultivation was important, as Xirong had said, having good weapons to complement his cultivation would undoubtedly lead to better results.\n\nStreams of light appeared on the stone table: the Sigh of the Ice Snow Goddess, the Roar of the Fire God, the Whisper of the Free Wind, the Melody of the Awakening Earth, the Hexagram of Infinite Changes, the Dawn that Pierces Heaven and Earth, and the Curse of Eternal Hell. For a moment, the entire stone chamber was bathed in shimmering treasure light, stunning the three dwarves.\n\n\"Prodigals, what utter prodigals! Look at all this good stuff! How could it have ended up like this?\" This time, even the steady Rada couldn't help but sigh, gazing at the seven divine blades before her with emotion and displeasure.\n\nNian Bing felt a bit embarrassed. \"I truly don't understand forging. Are all these knives poorly made?\"\n\nXirong replied, \"Not all of them are bad. Among these knives, only this one can be considered a true divine blade in our eyes.\" He pointed to the Curse of Eternal Hell.\n\nNian Bing blinked in surprise. \"Why? But I don't feel any difference between it and the others!\"\n\nXirong smiled faintly. \"There are vast differences. This knife was forged with life essence. Even our dwarven master craftsmen could only achieve this much. What's most precious is that this knife was forged entirely with the lifeblood of its owner, which is why the materials have such a high degree of fusion. I believe this knife definitely possesses its own blade spirit, and a very powerful one at that. Compared to your other knives, it is far superior.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at the Demon Devourer Saber, a hint of hesitation appearing in his eyes. At this moment, he recalled the shadow puppet that had detached from his control. After a moment of hesitation, he asked, \"If it has a blade spirit, how is this blade spirit utilized? Will it not accept my control?\"\n\nXirong explained, \"Of course not. If the blade spirit doesn't recognize you, you won't be able to use the knife at all. Didn't you see that none of us have touched your knives? The other knives are fine, but this black knife's blade spirit has likely always been awakened. If an outsider were to touch it, there's a high probability of a backlash. You don't need to worry about this knife. However, your other six knives are truly abysmal. Only this one, exuding an aura of light, is slightly better, with purer energy. Alas, so many excellent materials, even on the Divine Continent, are hard to find. To think they were wasted like this! If these items were forged by us, I can assure you, they could all become divine artifacts, passed down for generations.\"\n\nTaking a deep breath, Nian Bing smiled faintly. \"Perhaps I am too greedy. It doesn't matter. It's already my fortune to possess them; why demand more? Thank you for your guidance, seniors. If I encounter any good materials in the future, I will definitely bring them to you for forging.\"\n\nRada suddenly looked up at Nian Bing. As their gazes met, Nian Bing felt a peculiar shift in Rada's eyes. He nodded gently. Rada said, \"Nian Bing, when you go to the Death God's Waterfall, could you leave these six knives behind first? I'll try to see if I can help make them stronger.\"\n\nNian Bing was taken aback. \"But Senior Xirong said...\"\n\nRada raised her hand, stopping Nian Bing from continuing. \"I have a way, you don't need to worry about it. Perhaps I can only manage to make minor modifications to these seven knives. The Death God's Waterfall is filled with the aura of deathly spirits. Over there, perhaps only this black knife will be of help to you; the others might even have an adverse effect. After all, the deathly aura there is too dense. Do you trust me?\"\n\nNian Bing frowned. \"Auntie, I trust you, but to be honest, these seven knives represent half of my strength. If I leave the knives here, and if I encounter other dangers before reaching the Death God's Waterfall, I fear...\"\n\nRada shook her head. \"No, you don't need to fear anything. I'll have Xirong accompany you. He is intimately familiar with the surrounding terrain. With him, you won't encounter too much danger, and you'll be able to reach the Death God's Waterfall. Of course, once you're there, everything else will depend on your own efforts. Xirong won't be able to enter.\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment. \"In that case, I will leave these six knives here.\" He was reluctant to leave the knives primarily because of his shadow puppets. Without the knives, his shadow puppets couldn't be used, and his greatest reliance, besides his mental power, was his existing shadow puppets. But having decided, he wouldn't regret it. He thought for a moment and said, \"Since I'm leaving the knives, I'll leave the abilities attached to them as well. Perhaps you've already guessed, but I am an all-elemental mage in the human world. I have previously fused my magic with these seven knives to create seven shadow puppets, allowing them to utilize these seven knives with powerful attacking force under my mental control.\" As he spoke, a light flashed in his Heavenly Eye acupoint. Except for the shadow puppet, the other six puppets appeared almost simultaneously, startling the three dwarves.\n\n\"Blade spirits?\" the three dwarves exclaimed almost in unison.\n\nNian Bing blinked. \"This is just my magic, not some blade spirit.\"\n\nRada smiled. \"It seems I underestimated you, Nian Bing. I can tell you accurately that what you call these shadow puppets are, in fact, blade spirits. They take the blade as their body and innate energy as their form, possessing the abilities of their respective elements. If not blade spirits, then what else could they be? It's just that yours are the lowest-grade blade spirits; they don't possess their own consciousness. Good, with these blade spirits, modification will be much easier.\"\n\nXirong spoke up from the side, \"Eldest Sister, have you truly decided?\"\n\nRada smiled faintly. \"It's rare to encounter such good materials; how can I not try? Most of my life's effort has been dedicated to studying the art of smelting. Now that I have this opportunity, I absolutely will not give it up.\"\n\nXirong also smiled. \"Good, then we'll accompany Eldest Sister to try. Indeed, it would be too much of a pity to waste these good materials. Nian Bing, rest assured, we are far stronger than our ancestors from ten thousand years ago. In smelting and forging, there is probably no one stronger in the world than us. Rest assured leaving the knives here; when you and Xirong return, you will surely see brand new treasure blades.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"I trust you. Then I'll trouble Auntie and Senior Xirong.\" As he spoke, under the control of his stabilizing power, he commanded his shadow puppets to merge into the gems on the knives. As the shadow puppets merged with the knives, the light emanating from the blades immediately changed. The light wasn't strong; rather, it dimmed slightly. But this dimmed light constantly fluctuated, and its spirituality increased tenfold.",

    "content": "念冰收回噬魔刀，心中暗想，自己前往死神瀑布，能依靠的恐怕也只有這柄刀了。\n\n時間過得很快，轉眼間三天過去了。這三天，念冰拿出所有食物，為七位矮人準備了最好的飲食，讓他們品嚐。矮人們也不客氣，品嚐著美味的食物，對念冰讚不絕口。從他們口中，念冰得知綠蜥是神之大陸上最膽小的魔獸，也是所有魔獸中最弱小的種類，只會憑藉**攻擊。如果不是因為牠們能以含有礦物的泥土為食，恐怕早已滅絕。正是因為綠蜥的弱小，牠們也成為了神之大陸上大部分神人們的主要食物，矮人們也不例外。只是，矮人在殺綠蜥時比念冰更容易，他們僅憑藉**就能將綠蜥生撕活裂。神之大陸確實是一個讓所有種族都能快速獲取資源的地方。雖然這裡的生活是痛苦的，但只要能在痛苦中堅持下來，收穫也同樣巨大。\n\n令念冰有些奇怪的是，這幾天拉達雖然經常召集矮人們商量著什麼，但卻始終沒有動手幫自己重新煉製那六柄刀。他並沒有對拉達他們有什麼懷疑，只是心中隱隱覺得有些怪異。尤其是拉達他們在研究魔法刀的煉製方法時，並沒有叫自己和舄鹵旁聽，顯得十分神秘。\n\n三天以來，最開心的人恐怕就要屬舄鹵了。每天吃著念冰做的東西，他別提多高興了。這些傳說中的食物讓他眼界大開。念冰在不修煉的時候，還會給他講述自己在仰光大陸發生的事情，更使舄鹵對外面的世界充滿嚮往。正如舄鹵所說，矮人在山中的家建造得極為奇妙，不但有通風的地方，甚至可以通過一些特殊的位置觀察到外面的一切，同時，還與外界完全隔絕。那些觀察孔是用特殊晶石製成的，足以隔絕外面的魔法氣息，通過觀察孔，可以了解外面的一切變化。\n\n第四天清晨。魔法風暴終於停止了。據拉達所說，魔法風暴剛結束的第一天，是神之大陸環境最和諧的時候。這一天，空氣中的魔法元素躁動會變得極為輕微，是最適合外出的時間。拉達將念冰和舄鹵叫到石室中，簡單叮囑了幾句，就讓他們離開了矮人族的山洞。由舄鹵陪伴著念冰前往死神瀑布。\n\n舄鹵今天的打扮與平時大為不同，他穿上了一套全身鎧甲，這套鎧甲呈現為黑色。鎧甲看起來非常厚實，但念冰曾試過鎧甲的重量，輕得令人難以置信。而且，鎧甲雖然覆蓋了舄鹵全身的每一個部位，卻絲毫不影響他的關節活動。據舄鹵說，這件鎧甲原本是他們矮人族那位英雄的戰鎧，經過多年矮人族鑄造大師的不斷改良，已經達到了神器級別，防禦力極為強悍。\n\n呼吸著平和了許多地空氣，看著依舊陰雲密布的天空，念冰不禁露出一絲笑容，「舄鹵，我們該怎麼走？」他向身旁的矮人戰士詢問。\n\n舄鹵道：「這個簡單，我們不要登山，直接從旁邊繞過去。你不知道，前面我們要穿過的兩座山都是極為可怕的。眼前這座紅山中生存著一種非常強悍的魔獸，名叫折別。」\n\n「折別？」念冰有些好奇地問：「折別不是人類神射手的稱號嗎？」\n\n舄鹵臉色凝重地道：「牠們的名字就是由此而來。紅山上的折別是一種外形類似於獅子的怪獸，只是牠們的額頭上長著一根紅色尖角。這根尖角能夠射出火屬性的死亡光線，那種紫色的光非常可怕，以你的身體絕對無法抵擋。最讓人無法忍受的是，這些討厭的折別射出的光線有追蹤能力，無論你的速度有多快，都不可能逃脫牠們的攻擊。想與牠們抗衡，對防禦力的要求非常高。折別是神之大陸上四種最討厭的生物之一。單一個折別並不很強，就算不穿鎧甲我也能輕易毀滅牠。但是，折別的數量卻僅次於綠蜥，一出現就是幾十隻，而且睚眥必報，一旦得罪牠們，絕對是不死不休。所以，我們最好還是避開牠們，以免出現危險。」\n\n念冰點了點頭，「你是主人，當然聽你的。那我們走吧，趁著空氣中魔法元素躁動輕微的條件，爭取早點到達死神瀑布。」\n\n舄鹵點了點頭，雙腳點地，朝山下跑去。念冰縱身而起，趕緊跟上他的步伐。\n\n舄鹵的前進方式與念冰不同。他的跳躍力並不強，但跑的速度卻非常快，全力加速時，空氣中能看到一串淡淡的殘影。雖然眼前的地形非常複雜，但對他來說卻如履平地般輕鬆。轉眼間，他已經將念冰拉開了很長一段距離。念冰雖然合力追趕，但距離卻越拉越長，使舄鹵不得不停下來等他。\n\n一會兒的工夫，兩人已經離開了矮人族的聖山，來到了紅山前。舄鹵簡單辨別了一下方位，就順著紅山左側繞了過去。一邊跑著，他一邊向念冰解釋，這個方向遇到折別的可能性最小，也最好走。\n\n紅山周圍的火元素明顯比其他地方濃郁得多，念冰甚至能感覺到一股灼熱的氣息不斷撲面而來。有舄鹵帶領，他不用擴散精神力探查周圍情況，只是將精神力留在皮膚表面保護自己的身體，跟隨著舄鹵從紅山旁邊快速趕路。\n\n很快，他們已經繞過了紅山的一半。路上什麼都沒有遇到。舄鹵對念冰說，這片紅山因為是折別的領地，就算是更強大一些的魔獸也不會來這裡招惹牠們。畢竟，能夠應付折別報復的魔獸實在太少了。就算那些更強大的魔獸群有能力將折別完全毀滅，對自身的損害也非常巨大。在神之大陸這種惡劣的環境下，越高級的魔獸，智慧就越高，自然不會做損人不利己的事情。\n\n就在念冰剛要鬆口氣的時候，變化終於發生了。一聲低沉的咆哮從右側傳來，一道紅色身影飄然落在前方，擋住了念冰二人前進的去路。\n\n念冰定睛看去，只見攔在前方的是一隻火紅色的獅子。看到這隻折別，念冰不但沒有感到害怕，心中反而升起了一絲親切的感覺。火紅色的獅子，不正是和自己爺爺的外號相符嗎？火焰獅王。沒想到，竟然真有火紅色的獅子存在。面前這隻獅子看起來極為威武，比普通獅子的體型足足大了一倍。那火紅色的毛髮如同火焰燃燒一般，尤其是頭部的毛髮，看上去更像一團碩大的火焰，不斷膨脹著。額頭上的尖角長約一尺，閃耀著紅金色的光芒，更增添幾分神俊之氣。\n\n舄鹵停了下來，看著面前的折別，口中發出一聲低沉的咆哮。\n\n折別似乎並不怕舄鹵，仰天怒吼一聲，左前爪在地上輕刨著，一雙暗紅色的眼睛中怒意明顯，似乎因為念冰和舄鹵闖入牠的領地而憤怒。\n\n念冰看了舄鹵一眼，「現在怎麼辦？動手嗎？」\n\n舄鹵猶豫了一下，他還是很在意折別報復，猶豫著搖了搖頭，「念冰，我攔住牠，你繞過去，然後我去追你。折別的速度雖然快，但還比不過我，只要不引來眾多折別，就沒什麼威脅。」\n\n念冰點了點頭，「好，那看你的了。」在這種時候，猶豫是致命的。他相信舄鹵的實力，當下，與舄鹵交換了一下眼神，立刻朝前方衝了過去。就在他衝出的同時，舄鹵已經搶先來到折別面前。他這一全力出手，念冰才知道，原來舄鹵的速度竟然能夠達到如此恐怖，幾乎可以與短距離瞬間轉移相媲美了。只是一個閃爍，已經來到折別面前。他並沒有摘下腰間的戰斧，一拳直接朝折別頭上轟去。\n\n折別發出一聲低沉的咆哮，兩隻前爪驟然抬起，直接朝舄鹵的身體拍去。舄鹵還沒有折別高，但是，他卻並沒有閃躲，從正面迎上了折別的爪子。砰的一聲，折別那巨大的身體竟然被舄鹵憑藉蠻力一下甩了出去，撞擊在一旁的石壁上，發出砰的一聲巨響。這一切發生得極快。當舄鹵甩開折別時，念冰正好從他身前衝過，朝紅山的另一邊全速奔去。\n\n舄鹵沒有動，目光鎖定著眼前的折別。折別似乎被舄鹵激怒了，發出一聲更為響亮的咆哮，額頭前低，一道紫色的光芒在扭曲中朝舄鹵射來。\n\n念冰雖然已經飛掠而過，但他依然能清晰地感覺到，那道紫光竟然是天火，真正的天火啊！那是十一階的火系魔法禁咒才能發出的天火。他還是猶豫了，因為他擔心舄鹵無法應付折別的攻擊，前衝的速度頓時緩了緩，回頭朝舄鹵看去。\n\n面對天火的攻擊，舄鹵顯得非常平靜，依舊站在那裡。當天火即將臨身之時，他又是一拳轟擊而出。黑色的鬥氣伴隨著他那強橫的一拳，在空中發出霹靂般的爆響。轟的一聲，不但將天火轟散，鬥氣的餘波還震得那隻折別哀叫一聲，在地上打了個滾，竟然昏了過去。\n\n舄鹵的眼神突然一變，抬頭向上方看去。他看到的是一片紅色的煙塵，那當然不是什麼塵土，至少有上百隻折別朝他的方向衝了過來。發出一聲憤怒的咆哮，舄鹵不再停留，身形一閃已經來到念冰身旁，一把將念冰扛上自己寬厚的肩膀，雙腳用力，將速度提升到極限，朝前方狂奔。\n\n念冰反應過來時，看到了一片紫色的光芒。上百道天火在空中匯集成一股，天火周圍的空氣彷彿沸騰了一般，扭曲著，朝他和舄鹵追來。\n\n舄鹵沒有回頭看，但他背後彷彿長了眼睛一般。就在天火追近他們十丈之內的瞬間，他猛地高高躍起，用力將念冰甩了出去。同時，身體在空中一個翻轉，當初拿在拉達手中的黑色戰斧已經出現在他掌握之中。嘴裡發出一聲滔天的怒吼，瘋狂的戰意震懾得空氣一陣急促波動。雙手握住戰斧的斧柄，以腰帶背，以背帶臂，以臂帶手，以手帶斧，一道黑色的強光，如同開天闢地一般當頭而下，朝追來的天火群怒斬而去。他身上的黑色鎧甲燃燒出一團黑色火焰，那澎湃的戰意激發著他的鬥氣又強盛幾分。\n\n噗的一聲，天火在黑光面前一分為二。黑光洶湧而出，如同頭黑色的巨龍般迎向追來的折別們。折別似乎感覺到這黑光的無法抵禦，頓時用最快的速度向兩旁分開。那如同斧面形的黑光眨眼間掠過百丈空間，重重地斬在了紅山之上。\n\n一串密集的轟響傳來，紅山的一角竟然在這一斧中崩裂，大片的紅色粉末瀰漫於空氣之中，將折別們籠罩在內，使牠們無法感受到舄鹵和念冰的方位。\n\n念冰的身體被舄鹵足足甩出百丈開外。當他的身體還在空中時，已經清晰地看到了這一切。當他正要落地時，舄鹵已經飄身而至，一把將他重新扛上肩膀，眨眼間已經掠過紅山的範圍，快速地向前奔馳著。\n\n念冰的心在瘋狂地跳動著。這是什麼樣的實力啊！幾天以來，舄鹵在他心中一直是個憨厚老實的矮人，但是，他剛才所表現出的一切，恐怕人類中傳說才有的神師也不過如此。不，就算神師恐怕也無法一次劈開凝結度那麼高的天火，還將山劈開。天啊！難道在這神之大陸上，所有生物都像舄鹵這麼強悍嗎？如果是真的，那麼，仰光大陸上所謂的強者們又算得了什麼呢？",

    "content": "Xilv ran a long distance before slowing down. Panting, he placed Nianbing on the ground. \"Damn it, that was close. Lucky we didn't get surrounded by those Zhebie, or we'd both be in big trouble.\"\n\nNianbing looked at him with a half-smile. \"I suspect the trouble would have been mine alone. With your strength, escaping those Zhebie wouldn't have been difficult.\"\n\nXilv shook his head, pushing open his helmet visor, and spat out a mouthful of blood. \"These Zhebie are stronger than you think. Their horn attacks not only have strong fire attributes but also incredibly powerful impact force. Just now, defending against so many attacks, I sustained a minor injury. Fortunately, I've been diligently cultivating all these years. Otherwise, if I had been even a little slower and they had caught up, it would have been very difficult for me to escape even if I wanted to. Do you know that half of the impact force from their attacks just now was absorbed by this set of armor I'm wearing? The Dwarven race's ancestral treasure, the Dwarven God Armor, isn't easily broken.\"\n\nNianbing smiled faintly. \"It seems that without your help, it would have been impossible for me to escape from that group of Zhebie.\"\n\nXilv gave a simple, honest chuckle. \"Don't underestimate yourself. In fact, I could feel that your mental power is extremely strong. You're the strongest person I've ever met. Even the main gods I've seen before weren't much stronger than you. It's a shame you're currently in a zombie body, so you can't fully unleash your mental power. Otherwise, these Zhebie wouldn't have been able to stop you at all. I just don't know how your mental power compares to those true gods.\"\n\nNianbing gave a wry smile. \"There's no comparison. Anyway, let's not talk about that. You rest for a while, and then we'll continue on our way.\"\n\nXilv nodded, sat down on the ground, and began to cultivate. Nianbing dared not be careless. He activated his mental power, creating a seal within a ten-zhang radius to protect Xilv from external interference. Xilv's strength made Nianbing's desire for power even stronger. Looking at Xilv, even if he wasn't as strong as the main gods, he probably wouldn't be far off. When would he be able to reach that level? Even if he achieved his strength, there were still the aloof true gods above. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel agitated, and the bloodthirsty feeling within him began to stir.\n\nHis mental power spread out, making Nianbing extremely sensitive to his surroundings. Xilv had only just entered a meditative state when Nianbing suddenly sensed something was wrong. At this moment, he and Xilv were in a plain. The surrounding ground was a mix of black soil and black rock, appearing rugged and uneven. Calling it a plain was a bit of a stretch.\n\nThe sensation from his mental power came from a rock about a hundred zhang away. It seemed to be a life force. Nianbing's heart tightened. His Heavenly Eye acupoint fully opened, focusing his attention in that direction. At the same time, he summoned his Soul Devouring Blade from his Spatial Ring.\n\nWith the full concentration of his Heavenly Eye acupoint, he finally saw the source of his unease and gasped. It wasn't a rock, but the back of an unknown monstrous beast. Judging from the feedback of his mental power, the beast's body was at least fourteen to fifteen zhang long, and its exposed back alone was seven to eight zhang long. The beast's aura was unstable, and in terms of attributes, it seemed to be an earth-attributed monster.\n\nNianbing secretly hoped that the beast would remain dormant and not wake up. As soon as Xilv finished cultivating, they could leave immediately. Having witnessed the strange sights of the Divine Continent, he was filled with vigilance towards monsters.\n\nAgainst his wishes, just as Nianbing's hope began to flicker, the beast moved. Its massive back slowly heaved, and a body over ten zhang long emerged from beneath the ground, revealing its full appearance.\n\nIt was a grayish-blue monster, about fifteen zhang long. From its appearance, it resembled a giant python, but this python had a dragon's head and eight pairs of horns growing beneath its belly. As soon as it emerged from the ground, Nianbing detected a foul stench. Even his zombie body could sense the stench, indicating how noxious this monster was. Grayish slime flowed from its body. It slowly turned its body, and the pair of dull gray eyes on its dragon head fixed on Nianbing, flickering with fierce light.\n\nNianbing knew he couldn't wait any longer. On the Divine Continent, there was no such thing as luck. This monster would absolutely not let them go. Gritting his teeth, he suddenly lunged out, not towards the monster, but moving rapidly in another direction. His first priority was to completely draw the monster's attention to himself so that Xilv could successfully complete his cultivation.\n\nAs Nianbing had hoped, the monster's massive head slowly turned in the direction he moved. Suddenly, the monster let out a low growl, its body suddenly contracted, and then it sprang forward. Its body, over ten zhang long, seemed to weigh nothing. All eight pairs of horns forcefully pushed against the ground, stirring up a cloud of black dust as it suddenly charged towards Nianbing. Its speed was no less than that of the Zhebie Nianbing had seen earlier.\n\nWith a flash of light, Nianbing's body leaped to the side like lightning. Simultaneously, the Soul Devouring Blade in his hand was suddenly swung, carrying an aura of death. Having become a zombie, the power of the Soul Devouring Blade was evidently easier to wield. Although he couldn't unleash dark magic, the death aura within his body was amplified manifold by the Soul Devouring Blade.\n\nThe gray airflow met the monster's massive body, but unfortunately, the death aura was like an itch to a flea. It only left a faint mark on its gray scales. The monster's enormous body twisted strangely, and the lower half of its body suddenly swung its upper half upwards, crashing heavily towards Nianbing's waist. At this point, Nianbing knew he had to fight for his life. The Heavenly Eye acupoint at his brow instantly emitted a seven-colored light, and that peculiar eye opened again. His massive mental power formed a tangible seven-colored beam, which shot directly into the monster's large eyes.\n\nUpon seeing the seven-colored beam, the monster's upper body, which had been swinging, paused in mid-air. Then, something equally strange happened. Its eyes instantly turned green, a crystal-clear emerald green. Two beams of emerald light shot out to meet the mental power emitted from Nianbing's Heavenly Eye acupoint. The two energies met in the air without making a sound. Nianbing only felt a violent jolt within his Heavenly Eye acupoint, and his brain briefly went hazy. He couldn't help but spit out a puff of gray energy. The faint green light that had been emanating from his body due to consuming the green lizard disappeared, and the death aura was greatly weakened. A strong sense of weakness instantly spread throughout his body. Even the light within his Heavenly Eye acupoint dimmed considerably.\n\nA furious roar erupted as Nianbing regained his senses. Nianbing felt his entire body shake as the monster's swung upper body slammed into him. His body drew a parabola through the air, flying directly out for a hundred zhang before crashing heavily to the ground. Although he was in a zombie body and had been modified by the Dragon Soul, this fall still almost knocked him senseless. His mental power in his mind became briefly disorganized amidst the violent shock, but his mental power was, after all, powerful. Despite suffering a heavy blow to his body, his mental power quickly reconsolidated.\n\nNianbing suddenly realized that the zombie body was also quite good. At least he didn't feel any pain. If he were still human, the pain in his body alone would likely have made him faint. What was even more gratifying was that his formidable defensive power meant not a single bone was broken. As soon as his mental power reconsolidated, he immediately rolled to his feet, ready to face the monster's attack again.\n\nThe monster did not attack Nianbing again. As Nianbing stood up, he saw its colossal body rolling on the ground as if in great pain. Its emerald green eyes flickered with light, and each time, a layer of gray slime sprayed from its body. A roar of agony indicated its current poor state.\n\nSeeing this, Nianbing couldn't help but be stunned. Could this monster be having a sudden illness? This thought merely flashed through his mind, and he was immediately amused by his own idiotic thought. If monsters on the Divine Continent could get sick, pigs would probably be able to fly. He obviously didn't know that Mao Mao's little pig named Guan Guan could already fly.\n\nIf it wasn't an illness, then perhaps the monster's current state was due to his attack just now. His memory flashed back to that moment. Although Nianbing hadn't clearly seen what happened in that instant, he was certain that the mental attack he launched in his desperation had condensed all his mental power. That arrow-like mental energy was the strongest piercing force he could unleash. Could it be that this attack had severely injured the monster?\n\nUpon thinking this, Nianbing's confidence surged. He concentrated and sensed the state of his mental power. He found that although his mental power had been depleted significantly, it was not as much as he had imagined. Only about ten percent of his mental power was being restored with the swift circulation of starlight. This discovery further boosted his confidence. Nianbing had always understood the principle of striking while the iron is hot. Without any hesitation, he rushed back to the monster's vicinity. His mental power condensed instantly, and he launched another attack at the monster with tangible mental energy.\n\nLittle did he know that being able to turn mental energy into a tangible form was already an extraordinary feat on the Divine Continent, and even rarer was the willingness to use tangible mental energy for an attack. After all, one's own mental energy was very fragile and closely related to one's soul. The cultivation of mental energy was far more difficult than that of the physical body. Even if mental energy could truly condense into a tangible form, no one would be willing to use it to attack others. Otherwise, once the mental energy was damaged, it wouldn't just be the mental energy that suffered damage, but it would also threaten the soul, which was far more serious than physical damage, even with the possibility of becoming an idiot. If it were in the past, Nianbing wouldn't have been willing to attack with his mental energy either. However, as he was now, his mental energy was the only thing he could truly rely on. In the absence of other options, he had to choose to attack with his strongest ability, only to find that it was effective on the first try, severely injuring the monster that appeared very powerful.\n\nThe substantial seven-colored divine light flashed once more, splitting into two beams that struck like lightning into the monster's two large, emerald-glowing eyes. This time, Nianbing encountered no resistance. His mental power, like two sharp knives, directly pierced into the monster's mental world. As Nianbing's intent surged with malevolence, the monster's contorted body instantly convulsed. The next moment, it completely ceased to move. With a thunderous bang, its massive head exploded, spraying a sky full of green blood. Fortunately, Nianbing dodged in time and was not splattered.\n\nThe greatest difference between a mental attack and a physical attack is that mental energy does not directly attack the enemy's physical body, but rather collapses the opponent's mind completely, acting like a fuse to trigger the body's internal energies to riot. Therefore, no matter how powerful the physical defense, once the mind collapses, it cannot escape destruction. The relatively weaker green lizard was like this, and the huge monster before him was the same. No matter how strong its physical defense was, it couldn't withstand its own energy exploding from within. Monster mental energy could not be compared to human mental energy. Even with higher intelligence, they couldn't possibly understand how to deliberately cultivate mental energy. Nianbing's mental energy, which had reached the level of tangible attack, had become the nemesis of all monsters. It should be known that the stronger a monster's physical defense, the weaker its mental energy.\n\nThe monster's massive body, except for its head, remained. With the explosion of its head, a green, luminous bead floated into the air. Nianbing moved his mental power, using it as a thread to secure the bead and pull it towards him.\n\nIt was a bead about the size of a fist. Unlike the green lizard, this bead was filled with moist energy but had no bloody aura. The warm bead, like the monster's emerald green eyes, continuously flickered. Nianbing could clearly feel the vast energy contained within this bead. His heart leaped with joy. Without further thought, he opened his mouth wide and forcefully stuffed the bead into it, swallowing it forcefully. In his opinion, this was also some kind of core, and with his zombie body, eating it should only be beneficial.",

    "content": "As soon as the bead entered his abdomen, Nian Bing immediately felt a fiery stream rush down his throat. Although the zombie body couldn't feel pain, in the increasingly hot airflow, he felt his mind go blank. What was happening? Could this bead be poisonous? Impossible! Even if it were poisonous, his zombie body wouldn't fear it.\n\nThe bead in his abdomen grew hotter and hotter. Gradually, Nian Bing felt something was wrong, because the heat wasn't coming from his body, but from his spiritual power. The zombie body had lost all sensation, so how could it feel heat? Realizing this, he couldn't help but feel a trace of fear. He dared not delay, so he quickly sat cross-legged on the ground, concentrating all the spiritual power in his Heavenly Eye acupoint, feeling the changes in his body.\n\nThe moment Nian Bing closed his eyes, his body began to change. The body filled with the aura of death first grew the gray scales it had possessed in its dragon form. Soon, the gray scales began to mutate. The scales gradually enlarged to about double their original size, densely covering his body and appearing thicker. Then, the color of these scales began to change, gradually shifting from gray to blue, and finally to emerald green. If ordinary people saw Nian Bing at this moment, they might think he was covered in a layer of jade. Yes, they were scales as crystal clear as jade, with a treasure gleam flowing over them, emitting a faint green light that protected Nian Bing's body within a three-foot radius. Even his gray hair had turned dark green, with streaks of dark green electricity swirling around his body. The zombie body had mutated once again.\n\nUnlike the external changes to his body, Nian Bing's spiritual power was undergoing intense torment, the burning sensation growing stronger. Streams of scorching heat assailed his Heavenly Eye acupoint from all directions. What Nian Bing found difficult to understand was that his formidable spiritual power had no blocking effect against this scorching energy. He could only watch as these faint green scorching energies merged into his Heavenly Eye acupoint, integrating with the starry sky that filled his mind.\n\nThe intense heat made Nian Bing want to cry out in agony, but at this moment, he couldn't make a sound. The Heavenly Eye acupoint flickered with light, and the rotation speed of the ice and fire spiritual magic fusion spheres instantly increased threefold. The surrounding starlight also spun violently with the changes.\n\nHot, so hot, he was burning to death. Even during the spatial transfer magic back then, it hadn't been as uncomfortable as this. The omnipresent heat was constantly evaporating Nian Bing's body. His hands, with their dark red fingernails, also began to change. His bones grew a bit larger, and his hands appeared bigger. Fine scales extended all the way to his fingertips, and his dark red fingernails turned crystal green, shimmering with a faint light. They grew two inches longer than before, reaching five inches in length.\n\nThe stimulation in his mind gave Nian Bing only one thought: he would never eat anything randomly again. In this world, not everything could be eaten.\n\nAs he thought this, Nian Bing's consciousness began to become fuzzy. This was the first time he had felt this way since his spiritual power became solidified. His heart tightened, and Nian Bing knew he couldn't lose control of his body, nor could he fall unconscious. Otherwise, he might never wake up again. With this in mind, he controlled his spiritual power and forcefully stimulated the starlight formed by the fusion of ice elements and spiritual power. The icy sensation instantly spread through his mind, clearing his head and making him feel much more comfortable.\n\nThe clearer his mind became, the clearer the painful sensation was. All Nian Bing could do now was grit his teeth and endure.\n\nWhile Nian Bing was trapped in a hellish abyss of pain, Xi Lu, beside him, finally awoke from his cultivation. He only had a rough sense of the external events. He knew Nian Bing was in trouble, but at a crucial moment of cultivation, he was unable to assist him clearly. Fortunately, his will was extremely firm, and he did not fall into qi deviation due to the stimulation of external changes.\n\nAs soon as Xi Lu awoke from his cultivation, he immediately searched for Nian Bing's whereabouts. However, the first thing he saw was the headless giant corpse. The massive corpse was too conspicuous. Xi Lu was startled. When he saw the green blood flowing from the giant corpse, he realized this monster was already dead.\n\nTaking a sharp breath, Xi Lu murmured, \"Heavens! Isn't this a Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon? This isn't its habitat, how did it get here? Who killed it? Could it be Nian Bing?\" His gaze shifted, and he finally saw Nian Bing's appearance. Although Nian Bing's body was now covered in green scales, his facial outline hadn't changed.\n\nXi Lu was stunned for a moment. He flashed in front of Nian Bing. He had never seen such a transformation and frowned deeply upon seeing Nian Bing's current state. He didn't know what had happened, but in his opinion, Nian Bing couldn't possibly deal with the Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon. Yet, the Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon was clearly dead. To kill a Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon in such a short time, perhaps even a God-level¹ expert couldn't do it. Could a True God have arrived here? No, those True Gods rarely left their territories. Heavens! Could it really be Nian Bing?\n\nAlthough filled with doubt, Xi Lu could tell that Nian Bing was in a state of cultivation and did not rashly go to help him. Instead, he carefully sensed Nian Bing's current state. Through careful probing with his fighting qi, he discovered that Nian Bing's body seemed to be undergoing a marvelous evolutionary process. Not only were his skin covered in scales, but his internal meridians and flesh were also constantly changing. The aura of death had not diminished during the transformation, yet his body had undergone earth-shattering changes. Xi Lu didn't know exactly what he had become, but he vaguely felt that this was not a bad thing.\n\nRealizing this, Xi Lu finally relaxed. Since Nian Bing was cultivating, he could only wait. He turned to look at the corpse of the Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon, and a glint of desire appeared on Xi Lu's honest face. \"What a treasure! Truly a treasure. I've long heard that Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon meat is the most delicious among all magical beasts, and its scales are among the top three in defense. How could I let such a good thing pass me by?\" As he thought this, the black battle axe fell into his hand. He walked a few steps to the Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon and began his work.\n\nNian Bing was naturally unaware of everything happening outside. His mind repeatedly fell into a semi-conscious state due to intense pain, only to be forcefully brought back to consciousness by him using the aura of ice magic. Each cycle felt like a trip to hell, and the repetitive pain tortured his spiritual power. If he hadn't undergone cultivation during spatial transfers, he would likely have been unable to endure such pain long ago.\n\nTime ticked by, and Nian Bing himself didn't know how many times he had resisted falling unconscious. Each choice was incredibly difficult, as unconsciousness would make all the pain disappear! Faced with difficult choices, thoughts of his loved ones made him stand up resolutely time and time again. Just thinking of his parents and the three women waiting for him made the intense pain seem much weaker. To live and return, he endured almost frantically.\n\nFinally, after an unknown amount of time, the faint green airflow gradually weakened. The green light gradually merged with the seven-colored light in his mind, returning to his spiritual power. However, his spiritual power had changed. The original seven main stars had disappeared, replaced by seven swirling star clusters with countless trailing flames. These star clusters, seemingly composed of countless points of light, rotated continuously. The central red and blue light clusters constantly underwent fusion and dispersion during their rotation. The seven star clusters were not large, but if Nian Bing scattered his spiritual power throughout the Heavenly Eye acupoint, he would discover that after these star clusters formed, there was no empty space left in the Heavenly Eye acupoint, completely filled by dense seven-colored light.\n\nAs the pain gradually subsided, Nian Bing's taut spirit finally relaxed. A comfortable feeling replaced the pain. He had finally made it through. Looking at the vast sea of spiritual power, even he was somewhat impressed with himself. If he could overcome such difficulties, what else could he not do? As he thought this, he slowly opened his eyes.\n\nThe world before him suddenly changed. He rubbed his eyes, confirming he wasn't mistaken. He hadn't activated his Heavenly Eye acupoint, but what appeared before him was no longer the world it used to be. The air was completely filled with various subtle magical elements. Some magical elements drifted gently, while others rubbed intensely against each other. Even magical elements of the same type were in completely different states. Heavens! What was happening? Why could he see these with just his naked eyes?\n\nNian Bing didn't understand, but he wasn't happy about this situation. Who wouldn't be happy to see a sky full of light spots upon opening their eyes? Not being able to see the surrounding world clearly was the most painful thing. The moment Nian Bing had this thought, the light spots in front of him suddenly disappeared, and everything returned to normal, and he could see even more clearly than before.\n\n\"Brother, you're finally awake. You slept for a whole day! What happened to you? Why did you turn into a monster?\" Xi Lu's voice woke Nian Bing from his surprise. He looked down at his body and was startled by himself. Not a trace of skin was visible on his entire body. The aura of death seemed to have become even stronger. The hard and thick emerald green armor was real, emitting a faint clanging sound like metal when it rubbed against his skin.\n\n\"Heavens! What happened to me? I don't know what happened!\" Nian Bing looked at himself, wanting to cry but having no tears. How could he have become like this? With this appearance, even if he returned alive, how could he face his wives? He raised his hand and touched his cheek, which was also covered in scales. It was over; he had truly become a monster this time.\n\nXi Lu flashed in front of Nian Bing, looking at him curiously. He reached out and squeezed his shoulder. Instantly, a strong repulsive force erupted, knocking his hand away. \"Such strong defense! Nian Bing, if I'm not mistaken, you seem to have evolved. What exactly did you do?\"\n\nNian Bing gave a bitter smile. \"I wish I hadn't evolved like this. With this appearance, how can I face my family and friends when I return? I didn't do anything. After killing that monster, I just ate a bead that popped out of its head.\"\n\n\"What?\" Xi Lu exclaimed, his voice like a muffled thunder, startling Nian Bing.\n\n\"Did you really kill the Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon? How did you do it? You know, the Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon is one of the Four Great Magical Beasts on the Divine Continent². Even if it can't compare to the numerous Zhebie³, a single Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon can contend with and destroy over fifty Zhebie. According to what you said, the Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon you killed has already condensed a Dragon Bead, meaning it's at least three thousand years old. You're truly amazing, daring to eat a Dragon Bead. I'm very curious, how did you not die?\"\n\nNian Bing replied unhappily, \"Do you really wish I would die? What exactly is a Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon? Is it very strong? I didn't feel it! In the beginning, it was indeed difficult to deal with, but after attacking it twice with my spiritual power, I blew its head off. Then I got the Dragon Bead you're talking about.\"\n\nXi Lu made a gesture as if he were about to faint. \"Admirable, Nian Bing! I am utterly impressed with you. You actually 'killed' a Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon just like that? This Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon is not an ordinary magical beast. Its defense is definitely among the top three of all magical beasts. Even the strongest magic, Storm of Magic, could not cause it any damage. Although its movements are not very agile, given its size, it is much stronger than ordinary magical beasts. Moreover, it can spew earth arrows to injure enemies and control soil and rocks, much like innate earth mages among humans. It can be said to be the strongest existence among earth-attribute magical beasts. Even God-level experts are unwilling to face it, otherwise, even if they kill it, it would cause significant damage to their cultivation. The most formidable aspect of this Jade-Eyed Azure Dragon is not its defense or attack power, but its eyes. They are the only eyes among magical beasts that can unleash mental attacks. You actually said you blew its head off with spiritual power, heavens! What kind of monster are you?\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled. \"Am I not just a zombie? Perhaps this giant snake underestimated me too much and was killed before it could use its true abilities. It can only blame its bad luck.\"\n\nXi Lu was completely speechless. He found it hard to accept that such a top-tier magical beast was subdued by Nian Bing in such a manner.\n\nNian Bing said, \"Xi Lu, you haven't told me what that Dragon Bead is yet! Is it harmful to eat?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Xi Lu replied grumpily.",

    "content": "Nian Bing smiled and said, \"Alright, I know I have good character, you're just jealous, but you don't have to be like this. We're brothers, after all!\"\n\nXie Lu gave a bitter smile and said, \"I really don't know. The qiu dan of the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon is extremely rare. Its efficacy is the same as the gem on your Melody of Earthly Awakening Lifelong Blade, and it's also a gem of the same level. I never thought anyone would eat such a treasure. If one could use the qiu dan of the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon as the main ingredient, and also use its scales to craft a set of armor, its defensive power would probably not be much less than my Dwarven God Armor. Of course, the person crafting this armor must be one of our people. If it falls into the hands of someone who doesn't know the craft, it would only be ruined.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at his body with some helplessness and said, \"How was I supposed to know this thing was inedible? If I had known it was such a good item, I would have saved it to give to you. No matter, I've already eaten it. Besides shedding this layer of scales, there doesn't seem to be any harm. Let's hurry up, or we'll be delayed if we encounter another magic storm.\" With that, he identified the direction and flew forward.\n\nWatching Nian Bing's retreating back, Xie Lu mumbled, \"Magic storm? If the scales on your body really have the same effect as the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon, what does it matter if there's a magic storm? It won't be able to hurt you at all.\" After speaking, he shifted his footing, leaving a blurry afterimage as he chased after Nian Bing.\n\nAs they hurried along, Nian Bing truly experienced what Xie Lu had said. His body felt much lighter than before, and he could easily float thirty to forty feet with a simple push off the ground, without any feeling of exhaustion. Through his mental senses, his speed could almost catch up to Xie Lu's, and his agility was even better. Nian Bing didn't pay much attention to the changes in his mental power. While traveling, he pondered how to get rid of his emerald green scales.\n\nDue to Nian Bing's increased speed, the two of them traveled much faster. In no time, they had covered tens of miles. Along the way, they encountered several groups of magical beasts, and it was then that Xie Lu finally witnessed Nian Bing's terrifying attack method. Xie Lu's strength was already extremely formidable, but he had to deal with magical beasts one by one, dismantling them with his combat energy and battle axe. However, when he saw Nian Bing's attack, he completely gave up attacking. Although the magical beasts that attacked them weren't particularly strong, Nian Bing's actions were too abnormal. As soon as a magical beast attacked them, a layer of seven-colored qi would appear around Nian Bing's body. As the seven-colored light flowed, it split into countless fine beams of light. Once each beam of light pierced a magical beast, there was no other possibility – the magical beast would explode and die. Their cores then entered Nian Bing's abdomen one by one. Of course, Nian Bing no longer ate randomly. He would only eat after asking Xie Lu and confirming it was okay. However, ever since eating the qiu dan of the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon, he no longer felt a significant increase in strength when eating the cores of other magical beasts.\n\n\"Nian Bing, can we discuss something?\" Xie Lu asked tentatively.\n\nNian Bing was startled. As he continued to walk forward, he looked at Xie Lu and said, \"What is it? We're brothers, so just say what's on your mind.\"\n\nXie Lu rubbed his hands together and said, \"Next time we encounter magical beasts, can you stop using your abnormal attack method? With your current physical strength, it shouldn't be a problem to deal with magical beasts without using your mental power. Save some for me to have some fun!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"So that's what it is. No problem. From now on, all magical beasts will be yours to deal with. I'll be happy to have some peace.\"\n\nAt this moment, Nian Bing was in a great mood. Although the scales affected his appearance, the powerful body and seemingly endless mental energy made him feel that his strength had greatly increased. When attacking those magical beasts, he didn't need to consider mental energy consumption at all. After each attack, the seven vortexes in his Heavenly Eye acupoint would rotate slightly, immediately restoring his lost mental energy. Since he had such an effortless method, why would he use his physical body to attack?\n\nXie Lu shook his head helplessly and said, \"You're truly a freak, eating the cores of magical beasts. Sigh, you don't look like you're from the Yangguang Continent at all.\"\n\nNian Bing asked curiously, \"Why do you say that?\"\n\nXie Lu replied, \"Do I need to ask? How can ordinary humans adapt to the environment of the Divine Continent so easily? You adapt much better than those divine beings. I'm truly impressed by you.\"\n\nNian Bing laughed and said, \"So that's why. Actually, the cores of magical beasts are composed of energy. They are the core of their bodies. You can eat some later too; it should be fine.\"\n\nXie Lu shook his head and said, \"Forget it, I don't have your excellent digestive system. Don't forget, you're a zombie. Zombies have a strong absorption ability for all physical things, and your body is incredibly tough, so you're not afraid of the energy impact from the cores of magical beasts. I just don't understand how you were able to absorb the qiu dan of the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon. Logically speaking, with your physical strength, you shouldn't be able to withstand such a massive energy impact! It's precisely because you absorbed the qiu dan of the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon that you can now eat the cores of other magical beasts so unscrupulously.\"\n\nNian Bing said with a wry smile, \"These are the questions I wanted to ask you. Why are you asking me? No matter, if I can eat it, I'll eat it. Every bit of strength we gain is another chance when we reach the Death God's Waterfall, isn't it?\"\n\nIn fact, Nian Bing himself didn't know that although his ability to absorb the qiu dan of the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon was mainly due to his powerful mental strength and willpower, his body also played a significant role. Even with his strong willpower, if the pain had come from both his spiritual world and his physical body at the same time, he wouldn't have been able to bear it. However, his zombie body made him feel no physical pain at all. Another reason was that his body had been modified by the Dragon Soul. Although the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon was powerful, it also belonged to the dragon family, a superior variant of earth dragons. Nian Bing's body had been modified by the Dragon Soul of the mutated dragon Oscar, which greatly reduced the rejection of the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon's qiu dan, allowing him to absorb it completely and safely.\n\nNian Bing's rapid increase in strength also greatly boosted Xie Lu's confidence. Seeing Nian Bing's monstrous evolution, he was beginning to believe in the Life God's judgment. Perhaps this monstrous human really had a way to safely enter the Death God's Waterfall.\n\nThe two continued to move forward, and in the distance, a green mountain gradually appeared before them. This mountain was not as tall as the Red Mountain where they had previously lived, but its base area was much wider. The dark green mountain body appeared very solid, with no exposed openings. Nian Bing looked at the mountain with some confusion and said, \"This should be the third mountain, right? After this, we should reach the Death God's Waterfall. Xie Lu, can we bypass it like we did with the Red Mountain?\"\n\nXie Lu shook his head and said, \"That won't work. You don't know yet that the so-called crossing of the three mountains, this third mountain, isn't really about crossing it. I call this mountain the Green Mountain. The summit is circular, and no one knows where the water on the summit comes from. But I can tell you, the summit of this mountain is the source of the Death God's Waterfall. To reach the Death God's Waterfall, we must reach the summit, and from there, we can directly get to the Death God's Waterfall. Even if we take a detour, we'll still have to ascend this mountain from somewhere else, and the process is the same.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred, and he said, \"You mean the Death God's Waterfall is on the summit of this mountain? Are you sure? Could there be a waterfall behind this mountain? A waterfall that poses no threat.\"\n\nXie Lu replied impatiently, \"You're wishful thinking. Nothing comes that easily. I'm very familiar with the surrounding environment. Apart from the Death God's Waterfall, there are no other waterfalls within a thousand miles. On the Divine Continent, the most precious things are food and water. There are no drinkable water sources on the continent. We drink some murky water that flows out of mountain crevices, and only after purification can we drink it. Not like you, so extravagant, carrying so much clean water in your spatial ring. Of course, you don't need to drink water. However, zombies seem to need to drink blood, and I haven't seen you drink blood either!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Didn't I eat the cores of magical beasts? Those are enough to replenish my body. Sigh, it's not like I want this! I'm a chef. Making and tasting delicious food is my greatest pleasure. Now, all those pleasures are gone.\"\n\nA hint of seriousness appeared on Xie Lu's face, and he said, \"Alright, let's not talk about this for now. Let's think about how to climb the mountain ahead.\" Throughout their journey, except when they were attacked by a large number of Zhebie at once, this was the first time Nian Bing had seen Xie Lu show such an expression. He felt a sense of awe, immediately understanding that this Green Mountain must have something extraordinary about it.\n\nXie Lu said, \"This Green Mountain is known as one of the Five Forbidden Lands on the entire Divine Continent, on par with the territories inhabited by the Four True Gods. You can imagine how dangerous it is. Of course, the danger mainly lies in the Death God's Waterfall, which is the primary reason why it's rated as a forbidden land. However, there are also potential threats in the vicinity of this forbidden land. There are several species of dark-attributed magical beasts alone, including one of the Four Great Magical Beasts, known as the guardian of the Death God's Waterfall, the Dark Heavenly Fragrance.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned and asked, \"Dark Heavenly Fragrance? What is that? The name is quite nice.\"\n\nXie Lu replied, \"The Dark Heavenly Fragrance is one of the four most powerful magical beasts on the Divine Continent, and its strength surpasses that of the Zhebie and the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon. I've only seen its appearance once from afar. Its name is pleasant because it has the most beautiful appearance among magical beasts. If you only looked at its appearance, no one would ever think it's the most ferocious magical beast.\" Speaking of this, a hint of fear flickered in Xie Lu's eyes.\n\nNian Bing said dismissively, \"Magical beasts are magical beasts after all. We just need to avoid confronting it directly.\"\n\nXie Lu shook his head and said, \"It's not that easy. As the guardian of the Death God's Waterfall, although there is only one Dark Heavenly Fragrance, it possesses intelligence superior to humans. Its appearance is that of a bird, a bird with five-colored wings and feathers, but its head is entirely black. It emits a faint fragrance. This bird can transform into a human form. It is said that it already possesses the most powerful strength of the dark world, and the Death God's Waterfall is its source. Even the Four True Gods cannot do much about it. Unless the entire Divine Continent is destroyed, they cannot truly kill this Dark Heavenly Fragrance.\" He then looked deeply at Nian Bing and said word for word, \"This means that although the Dark Heavenly Fragrance is ranked alongside the other three great magical beasts, its strength far surpasses the other three.\"\n\nNian Bing was all too familiar with the strength of True Gods. The fact that Xie Lu claimed the Dark Heavenly Fragrance could even be compared to a True God made Nian Bing dumbfounded. With such a creature guarding the Death God's Waterfall, could he still obtain the fruit behind it?\n\nXie Lu sighed and said, \"Precisely because of the existence of the Dark Heavenly Fragrance, I was very surprised when I learned that you were coming here to pick the fruit. I really don't understand why the Life God would send you here. Is she sending you to your death?\"\n\nHearing Xie Lu's words, Nian Bing's mind raced, and a flash of inspiration struck him. \"Perhaps Kao sent me here precisely because I am a zombie? Although that Dark Heavenly Fragrance is powerful, it may not harm other dark creatures here. Otherwise, you wouldn't have told me that there are several types of dark creatures on this Green Mountain. Therefore, although the Dark Heavenly Fragrance is strong, it is not overbearing. Xie Lu, I've made up my mind. You should go back now. I'll go up the mountain alone.\"\n\nXie Lu was anxious and quickly said, \"What do you mean by that? I told you the Dark Heavenly Fragrance is powerful, not because I'm afraid of it. Since I've accompanied you this far, I'll naturally go with you to see. If we're together, even if we can't win, we might still have a chance to escape.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"Of course, I don't think you're afraid of it. However, you really don't need to go up with me. Kao sent me here and must have considered my strength. Since she sent me, she must have some confidence. Therefore, I must go up and try. If you follow me, it might lead both of us into trouble.\"\n\nHearing Nian Bing's words, Xie Lu couldn't help but hesitate. \"But... but how can I rest assured if you go up alone?\"",

    "content": "With a slight smile, a genuine light shone in Nian Bing's eyes. \"Believe me, brother. Dark Incense is incredibly powerful. Even if you came with me, once it unleashes its power, we wouldn't be able to resist. It's a case of choosing the lesser of two evils. Besides, I have a chance on my own. Don't you believe in the God of Life? Go back. If I'm not back in ten days, assume I'm finished. Don't overthink it; stick to your beliefs. If I don't return, I'll give those six blades to you dwarves. I believe they can still be useful in your hands.\"\n\nXilou looked at Nian Bing deeply and extended his right hand. Nian Bing met his grasp. \"Go. I have confidence in myself. You bringing me here and telling me all this has been extremely helpful. You called me a pervert, didn't you? Perhaps I'll do something even more perverted when I meet Dark Incense.\"\n\nXilou was not one for pretense. He gave Nian Bing a deep look. \"Good brother, I know you're looking out for me. Fine, I'll listen to you. I'll wait for your good news at Sacred Mountain. You must come back.\" With that, he firmly patted Nian Bing's shoulder with his left hand and clasped Nian Bing's right hand tightly before letting go and turning to leave the way he came.\n\nIf Xilou had been alone, no matter how much Nian Bing objected, he would have accompanied Nian Bing up Green Mountain to face Dark Incense together. However, Nian Bing's words had made him think of his mother. He still had his mother to care for! If he died, as the only adult male dwarf on the Divine Continent, who would look after his mother and his people? It was with these thoughts that he reluctantly bid Nian Bing farewell. Yet, as he departed, tears streamed down his rugged face.\n\nThough Xilou had known Nian Bing for only a little over three days, during that time, Nian Bing had unreservedly given all the food he carried to the dwarves, bringing them hope and a more tangible faith. For the dwarves, this was a great kindness. However, Xilou was deeply filial. For his mother, he had to choose to leave, he constantly told himself. Nian Bing's everything was arranged by the God of Life, but even so, his heart ached greatly.\n\nWatching Xilou leave, Nian Bing steadied himself and looked up at the vast and tall mountain peak before him. The green mountain before him wasn't green because of plant growth. In fact, on this Divine Continent, apart from the Realm of Life he had seen, there was no place suitable for plants to grow. The reason Green Mountain was green was that the rocks that formed it were inherently green – a deep, dark green. In the dim light filtering through the overcast sky, it could even appear black.\n\nWith a slight smile, a faint divine light appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. He didn't know what he was about to face, but having come this far, he wouldn't falter even slightly. \"Dark Incense, then let me witness your existence!\" With a flash of light from his left hand, he retrieved the Demon Devouring Blade. The black blade light flickered, combining with his own deathly aura. The dense dark elements, without conscious control, had already formed a solid barrier around his body.\n\nAt this moment, the Demon Devouring Blade suddenly began to vibrate slightly. The vibration wasn't strong, but with each tremor, a faint black mist emanated, giving Nian Bing a sense of excitement. Holding the Demon Devouring Blade before his chest, he gazed at the long, narrow blade that reflected no light, feeling the surging dark energy on it. Nian Bing murmured to himself, \"Old friend, climbing this mountain will depend on you this time. Your companions aren't here, only you to protect me.\"\n\nThe Demon Devouring Blade let out an impassioned, soft hum, as if telling him something. He raised his head again, a strong divine light flashing in his eyes. Nian Bing floated up, like a leaf, towards the summit of Green Mountain.\n\nThe surroundings were silent. To ensure his safety, Nian Bing fully activated his spiritual power, and the scene of various magical element fluctuations reappeared before him. As soon as he entered the range of Green Mountain, he felt a surge of power throughout his body. All sorts of negative energies continuously gathered towards him, and his zombie-like body madly absorbed all kinds of auras such as evil, darkness, death, and resentment. Through his eyes, Nian Bing saw that the scene before him was completely vast and grayish-black. Within the scope of Green Mountain, there were no other elemental magic elements at all; there was only evil and darkness.\n\nFor other creatures, Green Mountain would be an absolute death zone, but for all sorts of undead and dark creatures, it was a place of exceptional fortune. The dark energy within his body continuously surged with nourishment, reaching a point where it felt like it was about to burst forth. His body was filled with nearly boundless power. With every upward surge, even while still in the air, he felt the slight energy expended being replenished. Nian Bing thought to himself that if a large number of dark creatures were gathered on this Green Mountain, their combat power would likely increase by more than double. No wonder Xilou said Dark Incense could even contend with the Four Great True Gods. Under the specific conditions of Green Mountain, this was a very likely scenario.\n\nAs Nian Bing was sensing everything within Green Mountain, he had already reached the mountainside at a speed imperceptible to the naked eye. The closer he got to the summit, the greater the evil aura became. Although these dark, evil energies made Nian Bing feel full of power, they also stimulated the primal desires of his zombie nature, filling his heart with a bloodthirsty urge. If Nian Bing hadn't suppressed those dark desires with his powerful mental strength, he would have roared aloud long ago. But even so, the surging death energy within him repeatedly heightened his vigilance. Dark energy was a double-edged sword; while enhancing strength, it also carried the constant risk of backlash. Nian Bing understood that the first thing he needed to do was to ensure his mind remained clear.\n\nAs his sense of danger intensified due to the increasing evil aura, Nian Bing's mental power, now even more formidable than before, detected a subtle change in the air. Not far up the mountain, he sensed a trace of evil energy. This was not the energy of Green Mountain itself, as the aura intrinsically attached to Green Mountain fluctuated in a balanced manner, increasing with the mountain's height. This particular evil aura, however, had much stronger fluctuations. With Nian Bing's mental power, he easily detected this anomaly.\n\nNian Bing wasn't overly concerned because he knew he might have encountered a dark creature, but he wasn't sure if it was Dark Incense guarding the Waterfall of Death. He slightly slowed his speed. Pointing the slender Demon Devouring Blade forward, he unleashed his spiritual power, like a vast net, to lock onto the target. Nian Bing didn't use materialized spiritual power. Although that would allow his spiritual power to achieve its maximum effect, materialized spiritual power emitted too obvious energy light, making invisible spiritual power more suitable for concealment. However, at his current level of mental power, even without materialization, it was extremely formidable. As his spiritual power firmly locked onto the opponent, he clearly perceived the opponent's form.\n\nIt was a monstrous beast about forty feet long. From the feedback of his spiritual power, it was hidden behind a massive rock and was also observing him. Nian Bing found the creature's physique somewhat familiar; its plump appearance resembled that of a Dark Magic Rat, but its massive head was incomparable to that of a Dark Magic Rat. Just as Nian Bing was preparing to stimulate the monster with his spiritual power to find an opportunity to strike, the Demon Devouring Blade in his hand suddenly changed.\n\nA circle of black light emanated from the handle of the Demon Devouring Blade, and the handle suddenly became abnormally hot. Nian Bing exclaimed in surprise, as the burning sensation pierced directly through his spiritual power. Almost instinctively, he immediately released his grip on the Demon Devouring Blade's handle. With a flash of light, a faint black glow drifted out from the blade's hilt. In an instant, it condensed into form before Nian Bing: the Shadow Puppet. It extended its right hand slightly forward, grasping the Demon Devouring Blade. Without waiting for Nian Bing's command, it transformed into a faint black mist and drifted out, circling around towards the area behind the rock.\n\n\"Right! I came to the Waterfall of Death for an adventure, how could I forget about the Shadow Puppet?\" Seeing its appearance, Nian Bing was not surprised but delighted. After all, although the Shadow Puppet often broke free from his control, everything it did was beneficial to him. Perhaps it was because the dark aura on this Demon Devouring Blade was too strong, forming a blade spirit. It was a good thing that the blade itself possessed sentience. \"Let it deal with that monster, and I'll look for an opportunity to assist,\" he thought. With that, Nian Bing leaped up, floating to a large rock nearby, and watched in the direction where the Shadow Puppet had charged.\n\nWith a flash of light, an enraged roar echoed. Immediately, a massive body suddenly rose from behind the rock. Seeing the figure fly out, Nian Bing was startled. The body, about forty feet long, was almost spherical, and its head was also a sphere, just a few sizes smaller than its body. The way it flew looked like a huge ball of fat with a round meatball placed on top. Its two ears, each about ten feet long, flapped incessantly, carrying its body at high speed to dodge a beam of light cast by the Demon Devouring Blade from the Shadow Puppet.\n\nNian Bing was too familiar with the appearance of this monster. Wasn't it the same kind of monster as Mao Mao's little pink pig? Only on a vastly larger scale. Its body wasn't pink, but gray. \"Damn, a flying divine pig! It can fly despite being this big.\"\n\nThe flying divine pig in the air seemed to have heard Nian Bing's voice. Its enormous snout, which matched its body well, let out an angry grunt. Of course, although it was a powerful magical beast, its grunt was not much different from that of an ordinary pig, just much louder.\n\nSeeing the appearance of this magical beast clearly, Nian Bing felt a sense of amusement. \"What a flying divine pig. Could it have any close relationship with Mao Mao's little pink pig, Guan Guan?\" Thinking of this, he couldn't help but shout to the Shadow Puppet, \"Be careful of this fat pig's special move. It might be something like 'Blood Frenzy'.\"\n\nNian Bing had seen Guan Guan unleash Blood Frenzy before, and its power was already formidable. In terms of attack power, among all of Mao Mao's pets, the little pink pig Guan Guan was the most powerful. And this giant flying divine pig before him was clearly more than one level stronger than Guan Guan. If it unleashed Blood Frenzy, its power would likely be unimaginable.\n\nThe Shadow Puppet seemed not to have heard Nian Bing's words. Its body floated up like a shadow. At this instant, the spiritual power in Nian Bing's mind suddenly fluctuated violently. He clearly saw the Shadow Puppet change. Its body, originally formed from congenital energy and condensed by absorbing dark elements, became ethereal in an instant. Meanwhile, the Demon Devouring Blade was raised high, its dark energy, stretching over ten feet, rapidly contracted to within a one-foot range, its speed instantly doubling as it charged towards the flying divine pig's head.\n\nThe flying divine pig also seemed to recognize the danger. Although the growl from its snout did not stop, its massive body curled up, truly turning into a meatball. Its body spun rapidly in the air, with its two huge ears wrapped around the outside, and a layer of gray energy dispersed around its body as it suddenly charged towards the Shadow Puppet.\n\nSeeing this, Nian Bing did not worry. His spiritual power remained locked onto the flying divine pig. If the Shadow Puppet couldn't resist, he would immediately intervene. But from the looks of it, the Shadow Puppet didn't seem to have much difficulty resisting. Although the flying divine pig's attack area was large, its greatest characteristic when facing it was speed and agility. With its current charge attack, it was impossible for it to cause any damage to the Shadow Puppet.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was considering the direction the Shadow Puppet might dodge, a scene that made him both amused and speechless occurred. The Shadow Puppet, surprisingly, did not dodge the flying divine pig's attack. Its charging body suddenly braked, halting abruptly in mid-air. The Demon Devouring Blade was raised high above its head, emitting a black light. However, this light wasn't directed at the flying divine pig's attack, but rather shot towards the air above the flying divine pig. This made Nian Bing somewhat puzzled. What was the Shadow Puppet trying to do? The answer was revealed as Nian Bing was questioning. The flying divine pig's downward speed was naturally extremely fast due to its immense weight, while the Shadow Puppet's action was just a hair's breadth faster. The black light in the air instantly enlarged, and a colossal body, no smaller than the flying divine pig, suddenly appeared in mid-air. It was Sweetie the mouse's mother, the evolved fifth-tier Greater Dark Magic Rat.",

The Shadow Demon Rat's attack was truly unique. It retracted its relatively small claws, mimicking the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig, curling them up. However, its body did not spin. Its pointed head faced upwards, its small eyes looked straight ahead, its large backside faced downwards, and its entire body exuded a layer of black light as it unexpectedly sat down from above.\n\nThe Shadow Demon Rat descended just as quickly. Its weight was not insignificant either. As it neared the Shadow Puppet, the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig also happened to collide with it. Then, a scene that made Nian Bing spit out his food occurred: the dark, plump backside made close, intimate contact with the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig's round, rolling body. The two similarly enormous bodies, like two giant balls of flesh, plummeted from the sky, landing precisely on the mountainside of Green Mountain.\n\n**BOOM!** The massive explosion sent Nian Bing flying from where he was standing. Fortunately, he was prepared and protected his ears with his mental energy, thus suffering no damage. When Nian Bing entered Green Mountain, he had carefully examined the geological structure of its rocks. These rocks were not only filled with immense dark energy but were also extremely hard, more than twice as hard as the more common black rocks on the Divine Continent. However, the combined force of the Shadow Demon Rat's seating attack and the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig was truly terrifying. The Sky-Soaring Divine Pig's spinning body had its direction of impact altered by the Shadow Demon Rat's well-timed seating attack. Coupled with the Shadow Demon Rat's energy and their own combined weight, this momentary collision actually drove the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig's massive body two-thirds of the way into Green Mountain. Starting from the indentation it created, cracks continuously spread outwards, continuing for a hundred feet before stopping.\n\nThe Sky-Soaring Divine Pig was truly enraged this time. Its massive body strained forcefully, and it leaped out of the indentation on its own. Looking at the Shadow Demon Rat, which was still ascending into the sky, it let out a changed, pig-like grunt. An immensely powerful grey airflow condensed around its body. This grey airflow looked peculiar; during its condensation, strange grey vortices appeared all over the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig’s body, with black centers. The Sky-Soaring Divine Pig's previously languid black eyes had turned blood-red. With a low growl, its plump, protruding nose continuously exhaled streams of hot air.\n\nNian Bing's heart tightened. He immediately notified the Shadow Puppet with his mental energy, knowing that the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig was about to unleash a ultimate technique similar to Little Pink Pig Guan Guan's \"Beast Blood Boiling.\"\n\nHow powerful would the attack of such a large pig be? Nian Bing didn't know, nor did he want to know. Although the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig's movements were not fast and seemed rather lazy, the intensity of the dark energy emanating from its body far exceeded Nian Bing's understanding. The immense grey energy had condensed in almost the blink of an eye. Immediately after, the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig raised its front hooves, and its massive ears spread out to the sides like fans. A surge of immense grey airflow shot towards the sky, charging towards the Shadow Demon Rat, which had already begun to descend. The airflow it released was exceptionally strange. Its form was exactly the same as its body, a complete energy pig. The immense pressure, even though Nian Bing was not facing it directly, made him jump. He believed that even his repeatedly modified body would definitely not withstand such a fierce attack.\n\nThe Shadow Puppet's intelligence was far beyond Nian Bing's imagination. The moment the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig unleashed its full-power attack, or rather, the moment the energy pig and the physical pig completely separated, the Shadow Demon Rat in the air vanished. It disappeared completely, leaving not a trace. Although the Shadow Demon Rat had suffered some impact damage from the rebound of the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig's body, it had not sustained any substantial harm. When the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig launched its strongest attack, it was simply recalled by the Shadow Puppet.\n\nSeeing the Shadow Demon Rat disappear, Nian Bing breathed a sigh of relief. However, his suspended heart had barely relaxed before it tensed up again. This was because, although the Shadow Demon Rat had vanished, the Shadow Puppet suddenly appeared in mid-air, taking the Shadow Demon Rat's place and intercepting the energy pig released by the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig. At this moment, the energy pig's dark energy was so dense that it could undoubtedly be called a \"Death Pig.\" Although Nian Bing's mental energy was powerful, even if he wanted to rescue it, he could only attack the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig's main body now; it was too late to intercept the energy divine pig it had released.\n\nA miracle occurred again with the Shadow Puppet. Its body, calmly floating in mid-air, lightly merged into the immense dark energy of the energy pig. Under the strong impact of the energy pig, it was swept up and floated, while the Shadow Puppet's own body also disappeared within the grey energy.\n\nA miracle, of course, it wasn't a miracle. If the Shadow Puppet were to die just like that, how could it be called a miracle? Just as Nian Bing's heart sank and the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig roared excitedly, the energy pig in the air underwent a change.\n\nIf its own full-power attack was sent back to hit itself because the enemy was too strong, the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig would probably not be so terrified. However, it saw a scene it never wanted to see again. Just as it was excitedly grunting, the energy pig in the air suddenly lost its connection with its main body. The next moment, the grey energy pig instantly turned black, shrinking at a speed visible to the naked eye, condensing towards a single point in the center.\n\nThe Sky-Soaring Divine Pig roared. Under the pull of the qi, its massive body trembled, and its size instantly shrunk by a third, even the grey energy surrounding its body becoming much weaker. As the black light rapidly condensed, it reformed into a human shape. A long, slender black blade appeared out of thin air. With a flash of light, that figure had already arrived in front of the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig. It was the Shadow Puppet, restored to its form.\n\nAt this moment, the Shadow Puppet had changed again. Its body no longer had the illusory feeling that energy bodies usually possess. It was comparable to Nian Bing, who was not far away. The Shadow Puppet was black, while Nian Bing was dressed in vibrant green. Apart from the difference in color and the scales on Nian Bing's body, there were no other differences between them.\n\nAlthough Nian Bing felt it was strange to have an extra \"self,\" he also clearly felt that the Shadow Puppet had become even more powerful than before, reaching a level he could not gauge.\n\nThe Shadow Puppet did not look at Nian Bing. The Demon Devouring Blade in its hand pointed towards the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig's forehead. A stream of grey airflow uncontrollably flowed from the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig towards the Shadow Puppet. The pouring energy was continuously outputted, while the Shadow Puppet assumed an exceptionally comfortable posture. Apart from the Demon Devouring Blade in its right hand pointing at the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig, the rest of its body was fully extended, and its substantial form became even more apparent.\n\nNian Bing observed the Shadow Puppet through his Heavenly Eye acupoint. From the Shadow Puppet, he discovered a startling fact: at this moment, the Shadow Puppet's form was somewhat similar to the God of Life, Kao. The difference was that Kao possessed life energy, while the Shadow Puppet possessed dark energy—dark energy full of evil. Of course, the Shadow Puppet's energy intensity was still far from Kao's. However, the way its energy condensed together, giving a feeling of unfathomable depth, was remarkably similar to the God of Life Kao's vast vitality. This discovery, besides making Nian Bing excited, also brought a hint of worry. Was it truly good for the Shadow Puppet to develop in this way? Looking at it, it seemed capable of absorbing the energy of all dark creatures. If it continued to grow stronger, what would happen when its dark energy reached saturation?\n\nWhile Nian Bing was contemplating, the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig could no longer endure it. Although this Green Mountain was a great source of nourishment for dark creatures, it could not withstand the Shadow Puppet's frenzied absorption of its energy! It desperately tried to struggle, but because it had just unleashed its strongest attack, and although the Shadow Puppet's energy was not originally its equal, after absorbing the energy it released, it had surpassed it due to the shift in power. This made it impossible for the fat pig to resist any longer. It could only watch as its hard-earned energy was continuously absorbed by the Shadow Puppet before it.\n\nThe Sky-Soaring Divine Pig looked at the Shadow Puppet, its proportionally small eyes now showing a pleading look. The fat on its body continuously jiggled, as if it might collapse at any moment.\n\nThe Shadow Puppet let out a sharp cry. The Demon Devouring Blade in its hand released a black light net, completely locking onto the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig's massive body. The dark red light in its eyes flashed continuously, as if it were communicating something with the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig.\n\nThe energy was no longer being absorbed, and the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig's body stopped trembling. Its enormous pig head nodded repeatedly, its eyes full of pleading. The Shadow Puppet moved, and the Demon Devouring Blade flashed several times. The black blade light intertwined in the air, forming a strange symbol and imprinting it on the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig's forehead. The Sky-Soaring Divine Pig's body trembled for a moment, floated up from the air, and just like the Shadow Demon Rat before it, was absorbed into the black gem on the hilt of the Demon Devouring Blade.\n\nSeeing this, Nian Bing's eyes widened. No wonder they said the Demon Devouring Blade was his only divine artifact. Such a powerful dark pig, even he, with his mental energy attacks, might not have been confident in defeating it. Yet, before the Shadow Puppet, it seemed to have no ability to resist. Not only was a large amount of its dark energy drained, but it was also directly subdued by the Shadow Puppet.\n\nIn fact, the Shadow Puppet's subjugation of the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig was not as simple as Nian Bing imagined. This Sky-Soaring Divine Pig had evolved to the eighth stage of a demonic beast, its final form, and its strength was no less than that of the Azure-Eyed Green Serpent Nian Bing had killed that day. The Shadow Puppet's energy was several tiers below it. Although its abilities were very special, it could not have directly absorbed the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig in that manner. However, when it unleashed its energy attack, it fell into the Shadow Puppet's trap. If the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig had kept its dark energy hidden, the Shadow Puppet truly would have had no way to deal with it. But by releasing its energy, it immediately gave the Shadow Puppet an opportunity. Using various circumstances and the power of the Demon Devouring Blade, it completely absorbed the corpulent demonic beast into the blade, turning it into a summoned beast like the Shadow Demon Rat.\n\nThe same situation occurred again. After the Shadow Puppet dealt with the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig, it immediately retracted the Demon Devouring Blade into its body. Its substantial body returned to Nian Bing's side, and Nian Bing's mental energy re-established a connection with it, allowing him to control his puppet again.\n\nNian Bing did not rush to recall the Shadow Puppet. Instead, he gazed at this energy body identical to himself. The soul of the blade, was it truly just the soul of the blade? Then its intelligence was too terrifying. With that kind of tactic, even if he himself thought of it, it could at most be like this. Yet, this Shadow Puppet could fully utilize its abilities to create various situations for him.\n\nThe Shadow Puppet's face was expressionless. Nian Bing hesitated for a moment before recalling it. When the Demon Devouring Blade fell back into his hand, he clearly felt that the dark energy contained within this dark divine blade seemed to have become more condensed. Especially the surging dark aura, which was now continuously converging around the gem on the hilt. What a good blade, truly a good blade! He wondered if the Shadow Puppet could still display such power when facing the Dark Celestial Fragrance.\n\nHaving resolved the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig without expending any of his own abilities and having witnessed a spectacular battle, Nian Bing did not rush to ascend Green Mountain. Instead, he carefully observed his surroundings. He knew that given the energy intensity of the Sky-Soaring Divine Pig, no other dark demonic beasts could possibly live nearby. At this moment, this location on Green Mountain was the safest.",

    "content": "Approaching the cave left by the Flying Celestial Pig, Nian Bing couldn't help but be astonished by the vast depression. Wide cracks spread outwards, from which a strong dark aura surged, far more intense than anywhere else he had passed on Green Mountain. As his body absorbed the intensified dark energy, a faint black mist emanated from the jade-like scales on Nian Bing's body, and his bloodthirsty craving grew stronger. Fortunately, his spiritual power was strong enough to resist the influence of the dark aura. Suppressing his bloodthirsty urges, he unleashed his senses and began to madly absorb the surrounding dark energy.\n\nNian Bing had confidence in his spiritual power. His Celestial Eye acupoint had already formed its own system, and the natural reactions of a zombie could not affect his judgment. What he needed now was power, immense power. He sat cross-legged in the center of the pit, extending his spiritual power to maintain a state of semi-cultivation and semi-vigilance. He didn't understand how zombies cultivated, but he knew that for dark creatures like zombies, the stronger their negative energy, the stronger their abilities would become. Though it was merely physical prowess, it was enough. Therefore, his course of action was to boldly absorb the dark energy spewing from the cracks into his body with the aid of his spiritual power, merging it with himself.\n\nAs he cultivated, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a touch of envy for the Shadow Puppet. It seemed to convert the absorbed dark energy into its own power with relative ease. He, however, was different. Although both were forms of energy, his body required a constant transformation process. The dark energy he absorbed had to be fully converted into energy identical to his own before it could produce any transformative effects, which was considerably slower.\n\nThis cultivation session lasted for a full three days. What stopped Nian Bing from continuing was a peculiar sight: the numerous cracks that had appeared on the mountainside had closed, and even the depression caused by the Flying Celestial Pig was slowly rising, pushing his body out from within the hollow. With the cracks gone, the concentration of dark energy naturally diminished, but the three days had still benefited Nian Bing greatly.\n\nFirstly, he felt a change in his strength. His scaled body was filled with explosive physical power. He now wished to encounter another Flying Celestial Pig to test his physical strength against it, to see just how formidable his physique had become. Secondly, a change had occurred in his scales. The emerald green scales had turned a dark green, and the patterns had become more defined. However, the scales themselves had become thinner than before cultivation, with the dark green scales appearing somewhat transparent.\n\nMoving various parts of his body, Nian Bing felt no stiffness after the three days of cultivation. Although, being a zombie, he lacked human sensations, the feeling of overwhelming strength greatly boosted his confidence. He looked up at the latter half of Green Mountain. With a forward glide, he lightly stepped on the rock face of Green Mountain with one foot, using the momentum to soar diagonally upwards, instantly gaining fifty zhang. The control of his strength was incredibly precise, and as he spun, he transformed into an arc, flying towards the mountain body. As he neared the mountain, he stepped out again, his body rising in response. With two leaps, he had ascended a hundred zhang. His speed was now more than a third faster than before cultivation.\n\nAlthough zombies had many drawbacks, their physical bodies were undoubtedly formidable, especially for evolved zombies. The physical evolution was truly terrifying. Green Mountain was only a little over twelve hundred zhang in height. After more than ten consecutive arcing ascents, Nian Bing finally reached the summit of Green Mountain. During his rapid flight, he encountered no resistance, which made him feel considerably more comfortable.\n\nFinally reaching the mountaintop, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a sense of exhilaration. Looking around, he saw only dark green rocks. If not for a closer look, his dark green scaled body seemed indistinguishable from the rocks, save for the faint glow reflected from the sunlight.\n\nAs soon as he reached the summit, Nian Bing heard the rumbling sound of water. The dark elements in the surrounding air were extremely dense, and to Nian Bing's surprise, the dark elements here were very pure. It was simply darkness, lacking the negative energies of the undead or resentment found below, which made him feel much more comfortable.\n\nThe rumbling sound of water continued. The summit of Green Mountain was relatively flat, at least not adorned with many rocks like Sacred Mountain. Following the sound, he walked to the edge of a cliff on the other side and immediately saw his destination.\n\nBefore Nian Bing was an existence akin to a heavenly lake. Just as Xi Lu had said, a large portion of Green Mountain's center was hollow. A verdant lake filled all the space for ten zhang below the cliff. By visual estimation, it was impossible to determine the depth of this massive lake, but upon closer inspection, the water was as green as a giant emerald. The lake's surface was very calm, unaffected by the outside wind. The moment he reached the edge of the cliff, Nian Bing clearly felt an incomparably dense and powerful dark aura.\n\nThis was no longer mere darkness, but a darkness filled with a strange feeling, a darkness filled with death. The spiritual power within his Celestial Eye acupoint told Nian Bing that the aura he was currently sensing was pure death energy. Even his own darkness felt somewhat repulsed by this energy. His body swayed slightly. The death energy possessed a great pulling force, as if trying to drag him into the vast verdant lake below.\n\nHis heart stirred. Nian Bing couldn't be sure if his physical strength could withstand immersion in the death lake below. What was this lake water formed from? He frowned slightly, and at the same time, his gaze followed the source of the sound.\n\nNian Bing saw a small waterfall. The source of the waterfall was not far from him on the mountaintop, or rather, it was one zhang below the summit. The surging green lake water gushed out from a cave in the mountain wall, falling into the calm death lake and splashing large amounts of water, causing ripples on the serene lake surface.\n\nExtending his spiritual power, Nian Bing isolated himself from the intrusion of the death energy. The strange feeling immediately vanished. He couldn't imagine how an ordinary human would feel upon encountering such a powerful death aura. Even his zombie body, belonging to the undead, was somewhat overwhelmed by the death aura. How potent must it be!\n\nCarefully retreating one zhang, Nian Bing unfolded his body. He swiftly flew towards the waterfall. Naturally, he didn't expect the Dark Heavenly Fragrance to not be there; he only hoped to get closer to the waterfall before the Dark Heavenly Fragrance discovered him. Only by passing through the waterfall could he obtain what Kao had instructed him to get. As for whether he could get out, he could only take it one step at a time. Kao must have known about the existence of the Dark Heavenly Fragrance here, but since she had sent him, there must have been a reason.\n\nStill not encountering any obstruction, he retreated to within one zhang of the cliff, and the pulling force of the death aura from the lake lessened considerably. With his spiritual power isolating him, it didn't pose too much trouble for Nian Bing. His zombie body indeed had some advantages.\n\nSoon, Nian Bing was directly above the Death Waterfall. Gazing at the cascading Death Waterfall, he couldn't help but hesitate. With his practiced arc-style movement, coupled with the rotational momentum and the help of his spiritual power, he was confident he could charge through it in one go, considering the impact force of the waterfall. But, should he really charge through now? He felt a deep sense of trepidation towards the death lake water, making it difficult to make a decision.\n\n\"Jump down, what are you waiting for?\" a murmuring voice suddenly echoed, seemingly from all directions. With his spiritual power, Nian Bing couldn't pinpoint the source of the voice.\n\n\"Who? Who is it?\" Nian Bing spun around abruptly, unleashing his spiritual power without reservation. He activated his Celestial Eye acupoint and summoned the Demonic Devourer Blade into his right hand, sensing the fluctuations in the air. However, he was disappointed to find that he couldn't detect any target.\n\n\"Who do you think I am? Human, I believe you wouldn't dare come here without knowing of my existence. It's been a very, very long time, thousands of years, and you are the first to dare approach the Death Waterfall and seek my Heavenly Fragrance Fruit.\" The voice became very gentle, as if a wife confiding in her husband. Despite Nian Bing's formidable spiritual power, when the voice entered his ears, he couldn't help but feel a slight sway. His eyes flashed, and he fully sealed his spiritual power, finally struggling out of the demonic voice.\n\n\"Dark Heavenly Fragrance, since you've discovered me, why don't you come out?\" Nian Bing boomed. He stood still, not even taking a step forward, and once again came to the edge of the cliff. This time, he positioned himself directly above the Death Waterfall.\n\n\"Do you wish to see me, human? Then jump down, and I will surely fulfill your wish.\" Unlike the gentleness before, this time the voice became seductive. Under the influence of the voice, Nian Bing seemed to see countless beauties beckoning him. Fortunately, he had already become vigilant, maintaining clarity within his Celestial Eye acupoint. The starlight combined with rotation erupted with layers of multicolored spiritual light, completely protecting his body, thus preventing him from being affected.\n\n\"Ah! Your spiritual power is very strong! No wonder you could reach me. Looking at your direction of ascent, you must have come over the corpse of that lazy pig, right? Isn't your purpose here for the three Heavenly Fragrance Fruits behind the waterfall? Then why don't you jump? Jump! Jump!\"\n\nThe word \"Jump!\" suddenly became unusually sharp. Nian Bing's spiritual power rippled. He was greatly alarmed, as under these simple words, he actually had the urge to jump down immediately. If his spiritual power hadn't been tested multiple times and elevated to a level he himself couldn't ascertain, he might have truly jumped down under the effect of the demonic voice. Taking a deep breath, Nian Bing stabilized his mind and slowly raised the Demonic Devourer Blade in his hand. He made a simple movement, and the Demonic Devourer Blade swung out gently, emitting a sharp black light that directly struck the Death Waterfall below. At the same time, he retreated rapidly, soaring back towards the mountaintop behind him.\n\nWith a light \"噗\" sound, the waterfall momentarily stopped under the effect of the death aura from the Demonic Devourer Blade, and then cascaded down, continuing to flow into the Death Lake. A plume of black smoke drifted out from behind the waterfall, expanding instantly. A large bird, only half a zhang in length, materialized from the smoke.\n\nIt was a multicolored bird. Its appearance seemed to add a dazzling sun to the sky. Its multicolored feathers looked so crystal clear that, under the not-too-strong sunlight, they radiated thousands of colorful rays, painting the entire Death Lake in a world of color. Its wide wings spread outwards, and a clear, melodious cry emerged from its mouth. A faint sound wave spread, causing a layer of fine ripples to appear on the surface of the Death Lake.\n\nNian Bing concentrated his spiritual power completely and flipped backward in the air, curling into a ball. This was to solidify his spiritual power. By the time he landed, the crisp cry had disappeared, but he felt a wave of dizziness. He knew he had once again walked back from the brink of death. Otherwise, if his spiritual power had been compromised, who knew what would have happened.\n\n\"Phoenix, are you a phoenix?\" When Nian Bing truly saw the large bird, he couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.\n\n\"Phoenix, do you think I am?\" a charming voice came from the multicolored bird. Its body was beautiful, but the only flaw was its head. It was the only part of its body covered in black feathers, starkly out of place compared to the multicolored feathers. However, it was precisely this incongruity that gave this multicolored bird a somewhat sinister aura.\n\nNian Bing shook his head. \"No, you are certainly not. You should be the guardian spirit of the Death Waterfall, the Dark Heavenly Fragrance, shouldn't you?\"\n\nThe bird folded its wings, and the multicolored light almost instantly vanished. Its body, enveloped in light, gracefully landed on the edge of the cliff, directly above the Death Waterfall. After the light flashed, Nian Bing was astonished to see that the figure before him was no longer the bird from before, but a person. A woman. A woman beyond description.\n\nHer five-colored hair cascaded down to the ground. Her slender body was about the same height as Nian Bing. Her perfect figure was flawless. A colorful long dress covered every inch of her skin. Appearing to be in her early twenties, she seemed to be a human form composed of light colors. Her exquisitely perfect face was arranged in the most beautiful way, with a faint smile gracing her fair countenance. Her large black eyes seemed to speak, exuding an elegant charm.",

    "content": "At first glance, he looked like a girl of eighteen or nineteen, but upon closer inspection, he resembled a young woman of twenty-seven or eight. All the merits that women could possess were completely present in the beautiful woman before him, who possessed a multicolored singing method. She was a source of allure without needing to use any special abilities; she was alluring in herself.\n\nWhen Nian Bing’s eyes met hers in her black gaze, his mind fell into a brief blankness. Immediately, he heard a violent explosion. When he regained consciousness, he found himself still standing in place. The starlight within his Heavenly Eye acupoint was spinning uncontrollably, and layers of multicolored light continuously sprayed from it, automatically condensing into a wall of light before Nian Bing. Nian Bing instinctively closed his eyes, observing everything outside solely through his Heavenly Eye acupoint.\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance’s voice held a hint of surprise, \"Human, you truly surprise me. Since I arrived here, besides those four fellows, you are the first to escape from my mental space. Even my Demonic Eyes couldn't trap your mind. I’m afraid even the so-called gods couldn't achieve this. I don't know when such a master appeared on this Continent of Gods.\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance’s seemingly approving words made Nian Bing’s heart tighten. If he were still human, his body would have been drenched in cold sweat by now. In that instant, under the attack of the so-called Demonic Eyes, he had almost lost control. It was his automatically activated mental defense that forcibly pulled him back from the brink of collapse.\n\n\"Dark Heavenly Fragrance, you don’t need to ask where I came from. I have no intention of being your enemy here; I just want to take something from you. Once I get what I want, I will leave immediately.\" Even Nian Bing found this statement somewhat laughable, but his mental power had just been severely stimulated, and his mind was not yet fully clear.\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance smiled, \"Alright! I haven't stopped you from jumping down, have I? I let you jump from the very beginning, it's just that you didn't dare. Oh, right, I have a question for you. How did you know I was hidden within Death God Waterfall? With your strength, you shouldn't have been able to sense my existence, should you? My mental domain is completely released; no matter where you are around Death God Waterfall, you should feel mental energy coming from all directions.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"Perhaps it’s because you were too confident in yourself. That's right, I couldn't sense your mental energy originally. However, when you emphasized your tone and repeatedly said 'jump.' Your mental energy showed a subtle flaw, which my mental energy detected. Coupled with some simple speculation, I found your location.\"\n\nA trace of annoyance appeared on Dark Heavenly Fragrance’s exquisitely beautiful face. But even in her annoyance, her appearance remained as captivating as ever. Unfortunately, with Nian Bing deliberately observing through his Heavenly Eye acupoint, her captivating appearance could no longer be seen. He could only see her energy form, which was surrounded by gray and black.\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance’s energy was extremely peculiar. Nian Bing couldn't even feel any dark or deathly aura from her. Standing there, she seemed like an ordinary person, and the energy within her appeared very stable, as if she possessed no abilities at all. However, Nian Bing was well aware of Dark Heavenly Fragrance's power. He could even guess that what he was seeing now through his Heavenly Eye acupoint was what Dark Heavenly Fragrance wanted him to see, disguised by her mental power. Her mental power was surely only above his. Aside from the unfathomable strength of the God of Life, Caao, whom he had met before, Dark Heavenly Fragrance was the strongest person Nian Bing had encountered.\n\n\"So that's how it is. It seems my mental energy hasn't reached perfection yet. Human, do you think I am beautiful?\" Her voice sounded somewhat ethereal, but surprisingly, this time, no mental attack was attached to it.\n\nNian Bing replied calmly, \"You are very beautiful. I can say you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, but you are not human after all.\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance smiled slightly and said, \"How can you be so sure I am not human? Can't beasts transform into humans after cultivating to a certain extent? And can humans not transform into beasts after cultivating to a certain extent? There seems to be no such logic.\"\n\nNian Bing slowly took a step forward, facing Dark Heavenly Fragrance with his eyes closed, \"These are your own affairs, and they have nothing to do with me. Didn't you just ask me to jump down? Alright, I will jump now. You can move aside.\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance was taken aback and asked, \"You really intend to jump?\"\n\nNian Bing countered, \"Isn't that what you wanted?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance nodded and said, \"Then fine, you jump.\" With a peculiar smile, her body seemed to float up weightlessly, clearing the path ahead.\n\nNian Bing still had his eyes closed, walking forward step by step. He stopped only when he reached the edge of the cliff. The roar of Death God Waterfall plunging into the lake continued to reach his feet. Fortunately, Dark Heavenly Fragrance hadn't attacked him; otherwise, Nian Bing truly didn't know if he could endure it.\n\n\"Jump! You said you wanted to jump, didn't you? Are you scared now?\" Dark Heavenly Fragrance's voice echoed, tinged with a hint of mockery.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Of course, I will jump. But before that, I want to ask you one thing.\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance paused and said, \"Ask away, but I may not necessarily answer you.\"\n\nNian Bing suddenly opened his eyes, looking directly at Dark Heavenly Fragrance. His tone immediately deepened considerably, \"What is your relationship with the God of Life, Caao?\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Dark Heavenly Fragrance, who was floating in the air, froze. The light in her eyes immediately became hazy. In that very instant, Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye acupoint shone brightly, and the multicolored light condensed into a fine needle, striking towards Dark Heavenly Fragrance’s brow with lightning speed. Nian Bing himself then leaped down, his body drawing an arc in the air as he suddenly plunged into Death God Waterfall.\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance’s moment of disorientation lasted only an instant, but for Nian Bing, that instant was enough to accomplish many things. The mental piercing caused Dark Heavenly Fragrance to cry out in pain, and a layer of five-colored light erupted from her entire body. Her body tumbled several times in the air before she could barely stabilize herself. Under the mental pull, Nian Bing, who had leaped into the waterfall, was in an even worse state. A gray death aura was released from his entire body, and he cried out in pain, his body trembling violently as he continued to plunge into Death God Waterfall.\n\nNian Bing had calculated everything very clearly before taking action. He certainly couldn't figure out what Dark Heavenly Fragrance wanted to do, but he understood that no matter what, he had to jump down. Only then would he have a chance to obtain the fruit that Caao had asked him to get. Those three fruits were likely the Heavenly Fragrance Fruits that Dark Heavenly Fragrance had mentioned. Therefore, he first used words to provoke Dark Heavenly Fragrance. When Dark Heavenly Fragrance cleared the path, he quickly approached the area above Death God Waterfall and, taking advantage of Dark Heavenly Fragrance's momentary daze caused by his words, launched his strongest mental attack. Simultaneously, he calculated that he would receive no small amount of damage. A zombie's body, when injured, naturally wouldn't bleed. The greatest harm to a zombie was the release of death aura, and Death God Waterfall was entirely composed of pure death aura. By releasing his own death aura at the same time, he had a greater chance of entering the waterfall without being harmed. He had even accounted for his own injured state. In such a short period, it was the limit of what Nian Bing could achieve.\n\nAs Nian Bing’s body was about to plunge into the waterfall, Dark Heavenly Fragrance, who had just stabilized herself, revealed a fierce and mocking glint in her captivating black eyes.\n\n*Boom—* The moment Nian Bing’s body pierced the waterfall, he suddenly found that everything before him had changed. The waterfall was no longer a waterfall but had become a dark green mountain body. The surrounding death aura instantly intensified, completely eroding the death aura on his body while also enveloping him. Under a powerful pulling force, he began to fall towards the lake below.\n\nAt this moment, Nian Bing truly understood that Death God Waterfall, which he had been sensing with his mental power all along, was an illusion, an illusion created by Dark Heavenly Fragrance using her mental power. In this instant, it was as if a door opened before Nian Bing’s eyes. He suddenly realized that mental power could be used in such a way. Unfortunately, reality no longer allowed him to dwell on thoughts or insights. The cruel reality dragged his body towards the green lake filled with powerful death aura.\n\nWith a splash, Nian Bing’s body created a large splash of water on the lake's surface. With almost no pause, his body was completely swallowed by the water.\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance floated where Nian Bing had sunk, quietly watching the ripples gradually disappear. A hint of confusion flickered in her eyes, and she muttered to herself, \"Why would he ask me about my relationship with Caao? Did he know some secret? It seems this human does not belong to the Continent of Gods, otherwise, he wouldn't possess such strong mental power. On this Continent of Gods, all gods and humans have long been misled. Humph, I'll just capture him and ask.\"\n\nThe colorful clothes on her body gradually transformed into a black long dress, and even her hair turned black. Dark Heavenly Fragrance's appearance remained as beautiful as ever, but the alluring aura became much more pronounced as her entire body turned black. Her somewhat pale pretty face became unusually cold. With a wave of her hand, she reached towards the lake's surface.\n\nSuddenly, Dark Heavenly Fragrance's body trembled. For the first time, she truly revealed a look of surprise, because, according to her mental power's detection, Nian Bing, who had fallen into the lake, was nowhere to be found.\n\n\"No, this is impossible.\" Dark Heavenly Fragrance was greatly shocked. Subconsciously, she thought of something. With almost no hesitation, she flew out and dashed towards a spot five *zhang* away from the rock wall where Nian Bing had previously collided. The rock wall there had also changed, and the sloping Death God Waterfall reappeared. This was the real Death God Waterfall.\n\nA figure shot out of the lake like lightning. Before Dark Heavenly Fragrance, whose speed was imperceptible to the naked eye, could reach it, the figure instantly darted into the waterfall. That figure belonged to Nian Bing.\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance also entered the waterfall. At this moment, Nian Bing stood before her, completely drenched. Nian Bing happened to be standing next to a small tree only three feet high. His right hand had already grasped a milky white fruit. The small tree swayed, as if it could be destroyed by Nian Bing at any moment. \"If I were you, I wouldn't act impulsively, otherwise, this beautiful fruit might be ruined.\" Nian Bing's voice carried a hint of mockery as he looked at Dark Heavenly Fragrance, smiling. There were two other fruits on the tree, hanging precariously as the tree swayed.\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance's gaze was somewhat blank. She was well aware of the extent of Nian Bing's strength and truly couldn't believe that what was happening before her was real. \"Impossible, this is absolutely impossible. How did you do it?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Powerful Dark Heavenly Fragrance, I wonder which aspect you are asking about? Are you asking how I managed to survive in the Death Lake, or how I managed to smoothly find the real Death Waterfall? Actually, you made a mistake, which is being too confident in your own abilities. Indeed, my overall strength is much weaker than yours, but there is one thing you overlooked, and that is that the gap between my mental power and yours is not too large, otherwise, you wouldn't have been injured by my tangible mental attack. Of course, I was more severely injured than you, but I also had an opportunity after falling into the lake.\"\n\nThe gentle smile had vanished from Dark Heavenly Fragrance’s face. She looked at Nian Bing coldly and said, \"I just want to know how you managed to break free from the Death Lake with your strength. Although the Death Lake doesn't truly destroy the undead, with your impure zombie body, moving in the Death Lake would be impossible; you would only be completely sealed by the death aura.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Is that so? Then you underestimate me too much. I told you, in terms of overall strength, we are worlds apart, but I have mental power that is not much weaker than yours. Moreover, when I collided with the rock wall, I understood many things from your abilities, and you guided me in using my mental power. That's right, just as you said, as soon as I fell into the Death Lake, I was trapped by the extremely dense Death Water. My zombie body simply couldn't contend with this Death Water. However, at that time, it didn't affect the operation of my mental power. Your mental power can create illusions; why can't I learn from it and use my mental power to simulate the surrounding death aura and merge with the lake? When the surrounding death aura perceives me as one of its own, how can it pose a threat to me? Therefore, I was able to reach here. Perhaps you don't know yet, but before I became a zombie, I was a magician, and Mimicry Magic was my main area of study.\"",

    "content": "黑暗天香目光閃爍地看着念冰。在她绝美的容颜上，念冰却看不出丝毫可爱之处。念冰非常清楚，面对如此强大的敌人，自己稍有不慎，便有可能被毁灭。\n\n黑暗天香突然笑了：“好，看来我确实低估了你。你的精神力果然很强。不过，作为一个人，你觉得这样就能威胁到我吗？”\n\n念冰低头看向手中的果实：“我从未想过要威胁到你，我只是要带走几颗果实。我想，这三颗果子对你同样很重要吧。如果你强行攻击我，以我的精神力，就算无法与你对抗，也能瞬间将这些果子毁掉。别逼我做我不想做的事，你也不希望看到玉石俱焚的结果。”\n\n看着念冰那可恶的样子，黑暗天香突然妩媚一笑，说道：“你又何必非要抢这些果子呢？卡奥让你来取它们，无非是许诺了你什么条件。她能做到的事，我未必就无法做到。或许，我能帮助你呢？和卡奥比起来，我可好说话多了哦。”\n\n微微一笑，念冰说道：“你是黑暗的掌控者，也是我见到能使用黑暗能量的最强者。就算是巫妖也无法与你相比。不过，你毕竟也只是一个黑暗世界的人。你能让我从僵尸重新变成*人，赋予我新的生命力吗？我想，这不太可能吧。”\n\n黑暗天香：“不错，我是不能帮你恢复生命力。但成为一个黑暗者有什么不好？我可以让你重新拥有人类所有的感觉，甚至重新拥有使用魔法的能力。除了没有生命力以外，和其他人没有任何区别。难道这不比你重新变成*人更好吗？”\n\n念冰愣了一下，疑惑地看着黑暗天香。他的精神力虽然丝毫没有放松，但神色间的敌意却减弱了一些。“你能让我重新拥有人的感觉？我是否应该相信你呢？”\n\n黑暗天香那双黑色的眼眸中的目光变得更柔和了。“为什么不呢？我对你可没有那么多要求。只要你肯放过我这些可爱的天香果，我就履行我的诺言。”\n\n念冰松开了手中的果实，并高高举起手，缓步走到黑暗天香面前三尺外。“就这样吧。”他的神色很平静，平静得看着黑暗天香那柔和的目光。\n\n这次轮到黑暗天香愣住了：“你就这么相信我？如果我反悔呢？别忘了，我可是黑暗世界里的人。”\n\n念冰笑了：“如果你想杀我，我早已死了。”\n\n“为什么这么说？”黑暗天香好奇地问道。\n\n念冰淡然道：“很简单，因为，黑暗天香等于卡奥。生命之神，我说得对吗？”\n\n黑暗天香全身一震，黑眸中的目光瞬间变得凌厉起来。没见她如何作势，一圈淡淡的黑色光芒已将念冰的身体围住。澎湃的死亡气息如同漩涡一般围绕着黑暗天香和念冰的身体旋转着。念冰能清晰地感觉到，围住自己的死亡气息中，明显搀杂着黑暗天香的精神力。\n\n“恼羞成怒了吗？卡奥小姐。难道你已经玩够了？”念冰微笑着看着黑暗天香，眼中满是戏谑之色。\n\n黑暗天香的神色变得冷了下来：“你是怎么发现的？”\n\n念冰道：“是不是觉得我带给了你太多的惊奇？其实，所有的破绽都是你自己露出来的。”\n\n“哦？”黑暗天香疑惑地看着念冰，问道：“是因为我始终没有对你出手吗？”\n\n念冰摇了摇头：“那只是其中一小方面而已。在我登山之前，就已听说了你的大名，同时也知道了你的强大。以你如此强悍的实力，我又怎么可能在你的守护下进入死神瀑布，并取得那三颗果实呢？卡奥交给我的任务明显是不可能完成的。就连来这里之前遇到的那些魔兽，都险些要了我的命。当然，这只能让我感觉到你和卡奥之间有些莫名的联系，而不能真正判断。当我来到山顶后，你和我说话时就开始露出破绽。难道你没有发现，你对我称呼一直是‘人类’，而不是‘神人’吗？如果没人告诉你，我想，你不可能如此轻易地判断出我本不是神之大陆上的神人吧。”\n\n黑暗天香眉头微皱，道：“因此，你就觉得我和卡奥本是一个人？你别忘了，卡奥拥有的是生命之力，而我拥有的则恰好相反，完全是死亡之力。”\n\n念冰微微一笑：“生命，也总有终结的一天。生命与死亡虽然是两个极端，但在一定情况下却能够相互转化，所以，这并不能成为你解释的原因。当然，你会觉得我的条件也不充足，有些牵强，是吧？确实如此。但当我刚刚对你试探时，以及在我先前向你攻击时，只要我一提到卡奥二字，你的精神力就会出现极为明显地波动。难道，这还不足以证明你与她之间的关系吗？”\n\n黑暗天香冷冷地道：“那你也不应该猜我们是同一个人。或许，我们是朋友，是姐妹呢？”\n\n念冰耸了耸肩膀：“那你说了是猜。所谓猜测，就是大胆假设，小心求证。既然要猜，我为什么不猜一个可能性相对小，但却更能令你吃惊的结果呢？”\n\n黑暗天香瞪大了眼睛看着他：“就这么简单？”\n\n念冰微笑道：“就这么简单。虽然有些疑点，但我却只是猜测而已。”\n\n黑暗天香：“你的猜测果然大胆，连自己的性命也作为了赌注。你觉得这样值得吗？”\n\n微微一笑，念冰眼中流露出一丝淡淡的神光：“反正我也没什么机会了。如果我贸然摘了果子，也绝对无法从你面前闯出去。那三颗果子是我的希望，我自然不会舍得将它们毁掉。既然如此，我为什么不赌上一把呢？我的运气一向不错，我赌的就是你不会杀我。”\n\n黑暗天香笑了：“人类都像你这么聪明吗？可惜，聪明的人类总要早死。你赌错了，我现在已经想杀了你了。”\n\n一边说着，她纤细的手掌已经悄然印上了念冰的胸膛。没有作势，动作看上去很轻柔。但是，那轻飘飘的一掌却带动了周围布下的死亡气息，将念冰的身体牢牢禁锢在内，使他无法动弹。\n\n念冰没有挣扎，眼中光芒大放，直直看着黑暗天香那双黑色的眼眸，任由她那一掌印上自己的胸膛。墨绿色的鳞片在那白皙的手掌下骤然向外波动了一圈，皮肤如同海浪一般颤抖着。念冰全身一紧，窒息的感觉清晰地传入力大脑。胸口处的鳞片在那白皙的小手下剧烈颤抖起来，墨绿色的鳞片逐渐变成了翠绿色，在葱翠绿色中逐渐向灰色变化着。\n\n黑暗天香仿佛在抚摸情人的胸膛一般，在念冰的胸口处轻轻抚摸着。每抚摸一下，都会有一股自灵魂深处的痛苦刺激着念冰的身体微微一颤，眼中神光却反而更强盛了几分。\n\n“真的不怕我杀了你？”黑暗天香此时已经贴近念冰的身体，那纤细的小手在他胸膛上游走着。念冰上半身的衣服化为飞灰消失，身上的鳞片也在那小手的动作下不断地转变着。\n\n黑暗天香虽然说着要杀人的话语，但她的声音却非常暧昧。妩媚的眼神轻瞥着念冰眼中的神光，宛如情人之间撒娇一般。\n\n念冰勉强忍住身体的痛苦：“你当然不会杀我。如果我猜得不错，我对你一定有很大的利用价值，你又怎么舍得我死呢？既然你不杀我，那又何必再装腔作势。”\n\n黑暗天香轻叹一声：“你的运气真是很好。不错，我与卡奥确实有着非同寻常的关系。但你猜错了，我与她并非一个人。如果她是生命之神，那我就算是死亡之神吧。而这死神瀑布就是我的家。既然你这么想死，索性我就成全你。卡奥确实让我不要杀你，不过，你知道吗？你嚣张的样子真的很讨厌哦，所以，我决定还是不理卡奥的请求，就这么杀了你吧。你说好吗？”她的声音很轻，轻声细语中述说着别人的生死，别有一番奇异的感觉。\n\n念冰淡然一笑：“杀吧。反正我本身也是个死人。”\n\n黑暗天香抬起头看着念冰，杀机从眼眸中一闪而过。纤细的小手轻轻离开了念冰的胸膛。当她的手距离念冰胸口处三寸时停了下来。这一掌按下去，别说是一个僵尸，就算是一只顶级黑暗魔兽，恐怕也会完全毁灭。\n\n就在这时，一直泰然处之，准备随时受死的念冰突然动了。七彩光芒电射而出，箭一般的精神实体骤然朝黑暗天香的额头刺去。\n\n黑暗天香冷哼一声，右手原势不变地朝念冰胸口处拍去。黑眸射出两道冷冷的寒光，骤然迎上了念冰的精神攻击。但是，令她没有想到的是，念冰天眼穴中出的精神力只是一触即收，并没有与她的精神力接触。而念冰的身体骤然暴退，收回的精神力直接刺上了黑暗天香的掌心。他的身体向下一矮，一个翻滚，朝身后的果树扑去。\n\n“米粒之珠，也敢放光华？”黑暗天香拍出的手轻轻一收，一股浓郁的黑色气流飘然而出，与念冰出的实体精神力搅在一起。念冰惨呼一声，飞退的身体在空中缓了一下，全身死亡气息大冒，显然是受了不轻的创伤。而黑暗天香的身体也停顿了一下，眼中释放的精神能量飘然回收。就在她旧力已尽，新力未生之时，一道无形的尖锐突然刺上了她的背心。\n\n“噗——”黑暗天香的身体在巨大的冲击力作用下骤然前扑，张口喷出一股黑色液体构成的血雾，眼中充满骇然之色。在这一刻，她竟然失去了对身体的控制。身体在前冲的状态下，笔直地撞上了前方因为精神力被破而摔倒在地的念冰。\n\n两人撞在一起，顿时变成了滚地葫芦。念冰下意识地搂紧了黑暗天香的身体。那是一个温软的娇躯，仿佛没有骨头一般，但搂在怀中却充满了弹性。瞬间的美妙使念冰竟然有些迷离了。身体在翻转过程中并没有再向黑暗天香下手。\n\n黑暗天香这次伤得很重，又喷出一口黑色液体。而她背心处，也不断涌出一股股黑色液体，身体散发的能量明显减弱了一半以上。\n\n念冰终究是念冰。以他的精神力强度，并没有过多久的迷失，立刻找回了自我。身体在翻滚中猛地站了起来，怀中依旧抱着黑暗天香。而精神力瞬间爆发，强忍着天眼穴中剧烈的疼痛，又向黑暗天香动了一次实质精神力攻击。好不容易找到的机会，他又怎么可能放弃呢？虽然在发动这次攻击时，念冰感觉有些惋惜，毕竟是这么美的人儿啊！就这么爆体而亡，确实有些可惜了。\n\n“想死吗？快放开我。”一个冷漠的声音响起。念冰的精神力刚出，全身却如触电一般剧烈颤抖了一下。他骇然发现，自己怀中所抱的，已经不再是那个充满死亡气息的黑暗天香，而是完全由生命气息组成的生命之神卡奥。就连外表也完全变了。卡奥那普通的容貌，朴素的装束，与黑暗天香截然不同。就在这一刻，黑暗天香已经变成了另一个人。\n\n念冰先是愣了一下，刚想放开手，但他立刻想到了不对劲的地方。强忍着自己对生命气息的不适，用力将卡奥抱紧：“想得美，你说放就放啊！黑暗天香，我知道你的精神力擅长幻化，但这一次，我绝不会再上当了。我倒要看看，当你的心神紊乱的时候，还能不能再变成卡奥的模样来骗我。”",

    "content": "He embraced Kao tightly as he spoke, lowering his head and kissing her lips forcefully.\n\nIn that moment, Kao's eyes were filled with surprise. She had forgotten to resist, allowing Nian Bing to kiss her lips.\n\nA wave of coolness suddenly washed over his mind. Nian Bing realized he had arrived in another world. The pain in his Tianyan acupoint was gone. Above and below, all he could feel was the fullness in his arms—a fullness indescribable in words, stimulating his nerves. He was astonished to find that at this moment, he seemed to have regained some human feelings. The warmth of her lips against his was as refreshing as the purest spring water, nourishing his body. This wonderful sensation was something Nian Bing had never experienced since becoming a zombie. He didn't know why this was happening, but the lips he was kissing kept changing, sometimes as cold as snow, sometimes as hot as fire. Through the constant shifting between ice and fire, completely different currents entered his body from those soft lips. Everything seemed to be changing. Nian Bing wanted to stop it all, but he found that arms carved from jade had somehow wrapped around his neck. The wonderful feeling intensified with every kiss, and Nian Bing's consciousness finally succumbed.\n\nNian Bing's kiss of Dark Heavenly Fragrance, in a sense, was a mischievous act. Dark Heavenly Fragrance was severely injured, presenting his greatest opportunity, an opportunity he would never let pass. The moment Nian Bing fell into the lake, a vast amount of death energy enveloped his body. Although he was a spirit of the dead, this death energy could not destroy him. However, his not-so-pure zombie body, facing the purest death energy, first underwent a change. The instincts of a zombie were rapidly amplified by the pure death energy, and the urge to devour blood rose to a new level, as if it would consume Nian Bing's consciousness entirely.\n\nNian Bing told Dark Heavenly Fragrance that he escaped the lake by using his mental power to simulate death energy. While this was true, it wasn't the whole truth. Although he had grasped a certain degree of mental power usage from Dark Heavenly Fragrance's abilities, his understanding was not profound. In such a haste, how could he have achieved such perfection? The simulation of mental power only allowed Nian Bing to regain some mobility and alleviate his discomfort. What truly saved him was the curse of the Eternal Underworld—the Demon Devouring Blade.\n\nYes, it was the Demon Devouring Blade. When Nian Bing fell into the water, he was still holding the Demon Devouring Blade. While his body was being tormented, the Demon Devouring Blade, like a fish in water, madly absorbed the death energy from the Lake of Death. Nian Bing was not the purest spirit of the dead, but the Demon Devouring Blade was the purest dark demonic artifact. Its pure darkness was of the same origin as the energy in the Lake of Death. Before Nian Bing could react, the Shadow Puppet had automatically appeared, taking the Demon Devouring Blade from Nian Bing's hand. With a flash, it pushed back the water of death surrounding Nian Bing and, guided by Nian Bing's mental power, tossed him out of the lake, entering the waterfall ahead of Dark Heavenly Fragrance. Although everything happened extremely quickly, Nian Bing clearly felt the excitement the Shadow Puppet transmitted to him. This was the first time the Shadow Puppet had genuinely conveyed feelings to him. At that moment, Nian Bing finally confirmed that the Shadow Puppet possessed high intelligence.\n\nThrough their mental connection, the Shadow Puppet told Nian Bing to stall for time, allowing it to absorb more death energy, and then to ambush from the rear, creating an opportunity for Nian Bing. Thus, after entering the waterfall, Nian Bing first threatened Dark Heavenly Fragrance with the fruit. Everything he said afterward was logical, but he had no certainty in his heart; he didn't even believe his own words, yet Dark Heavenly Fragrance was filled with doubt. When Nian Bing sensed Dark Heavenly Fragrance's killing intent towards him, he knew he couldn't wait any longer. Therefore, he used that brief opening to attack Dark Heavenly Fragrance while simultaneously summoning the Shadow Puppet.\n\nIn a short time, the Shadow Puppet had absorbed a large amount of death energy. However, being of darkness, while the death energy was a great supplement, absorbing so much at once was unsustainable. Thus, upon receiving Nian Bing's summons, it immediately mixed all the absorbed death energy with its dark energy, rotating them in a specific manner, and with the power of the Demon Devouring Blade, launched a surprise attack on Dark Heavenly Fragrance from behind.\n\nOriginally, with Dark Heavenly Fragrance's strength, she should have detected the Shadow Puppet. However, her mind was somewhat disturbed by Nian Bing's words, causing her perception of her surroundings through mental power to weaken slightly. Moreover, Nian Bing's attack also caused her considerable trouble. The energy form of the Shadow Puppet's attack was also extremely similar to her own energy, causing her to be struck by the Shadow Puppet's attack without realizing it, hitting a vital spot.\n\nHeaven and earth were constantly changing. The Shadow Puppet stared at Nian Bing and the woman he embraced, stunned. The Demon Devouring Blade was raised high, yet it hesitated, unsure if it should strike. Everything the Shadow Puppet saw at this moment was too bizarre.\n\nNian Bing's eyes were closed as he kissed the woman in his arms with almost ecstatic devotion. The woman in his embrace kept changing, sometimes the dignified Life Goddess Kao, and sometimes the endlessly seductive Dark Heavenly Fragrance. As she changed, the aura in the waterfall cave also shifted, filled with life one moment and death the next, utterly confusing the Shadow Puppet.\n\nNian Bing didn't know how long had passed. All he knew was that the kiss felt incredibly satisfying. He had been completely immersed when kissing Feng Nu before, but never had he experienced such a beautiful energy flow through mental power fluctuations. With his current mental strength, only in such beauty could his consciousness be lost.\n\n\"Isn't that enough?\" a shy voice echoed from the depths of his soul. The next moment, Nian Bing's consciousness instantly cleared. He forcefully pushed the woman in his arms away and retreated several steps, almost tripping over the small tree on the ground.\n\nPanting sounds came from the opposite side. Nian Bing looked closely and saw Dark Heavenly Fragrance standing before him. However, her delicate face no longer bore that pallor. A faint blush added a touch of shy beauty to her. Her dark eyes were filled with complex emotions, and she seemed to be lost in thought.\n\n\"Human, do you know? You are truly dead this time.\" Dark Heavenly Fragrance didn't even glance at the Shadow Puppet beside her, as if it didn't exist.\n\nNian Bing swallowed and said calmly, \"If that's the case, why haven't you made your move yet?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance shook her head. \"I won't kill you, but you have done something that forces others to kill you.\"\n\nNian Bing blinked. \"I don't understand what you mean. Could it be that because you used mental illusion...\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance glared at Nian Bing impatiently. \"You're the one who's crazy. How hateful, taking advantage of someone and then speaking sarcastically? I don't care; you've stolen my first kiss, so from now on, you are my man.\"\n\nNian Bing stared blankly at Dark Heavenly Fragrance. These sudden changes left him bewildered, unable to understand why Dark Heavenly Fragrance had changed so drastically.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing's stunned expression, Dark Heavenly Fragrance chuckled. \"Although I hate that you stole my first kiss, I also really like how you looked just now. Do you know? This is the first time I've seen her suffer such a huge blow that she lost control of her body. It's so amusing.\"\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath and said to Dark Heavenly Fragrance in a deep voice, \"What exactly do you mean? With your abilities, you could kill me at any time, but if you're still trying to play games with me, it's impossible.\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance stepped forward, approaching Nian Bing and reaching out to touch his face. At that moment, the Shadow Puppet, which had not received Nian Bing's command, suddenly moved. Its body became ethereal as it lunged forward. Its body merged with the Demon Devouring Blade, which instantly tripled in size. The blade emitted no light, but its main body shot towards Dark Heavenly Fragrance's back like a black lightning bolt.\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance let out a cold snort. \"You were the one who injured me just now. Daring to use my energy to harm me, you are very bold!\" As she spoke, her graceful body fluttered in the air. With a gentle wave of her right hand, black starlight emerged, connected by gray threads, and floated to entwine the enlarged Demon Devouring Blade. Dark Heavenly Fragrance stomped her left foot on the ground. \"Begone. Since it's yours, I'll spare your life. You want to absorb? Then go down and absorb.\" With a flash of black starlight, the Demon Devouring Blade and the revealed Shadow Puppet were flung away together, directly into the Death Lake outside.\n\nFrom the moment Dark Heavenly Fragrance acted until her movements ended, Nian Bing clearly felt Dark Heavenly Fragrance's mental power locked onto him, leaving him no room for resistance. He clearly felt that this was Dark Heavenly Fragrance's true strength. Although she had been injured earlier, the power she displayed at this moment made Nian Bing profoundly realize its irresistible nature. It was too strong; the overwhelming dark energy surged to its peak, as if Dark Heavenly Fragrance herself had merged with everything around her, with the entire Green Mountain.\n\n\"Alright, I've thrown your little thing into the Death Lake to enjoy itself. Now we can talk properly.\" Clapping her hands as if she had just done the simplest thing, Dark Heavenly Fragrance smiled charmingly at Nian Bing and reached out to gently caress the scales on his face. She frowned slightly. \"Judging by your outline, you should be a handsome man. What a shame you've become like this! I will definitely help you regain your original appearance.\"\n\nThe oppressive force lifted, and Nian Bing could finally speak. He looked at Dark Heavenly Fragrance with a hint of dread. \"Your abilities are so strong, why did it seem like you were being suppressed by me earlier?\"\n\n\"You suppressed me? Did I? I don't recall. Oh, right, there are two things I need to tell you. Don't think that your little guy injured me. Although I spat blood, within the range of this Death God Waterfall, I am immortal. Even if I'm injured, I'll be replenished by the surrounding energy immediately, unless someone can completely destroy this Green Mountain and eliminate all the dark energy here. Only then might I be truly destroyed, or truly injured. Secondly, don't you find what I said earlier strange? It's nothing. I just want to tell you that when you kissed me just now, it wasn't an illusion, but the real Life Goddess Kao. You're truly lucky, getting the first kisses of two beauties at once. No wonder you even said you were lucky yourself.\"\n\nNian Bing stared blankly at Dark Heavenly Fragrance, murmuring, \"Will you tell me that my previous wild guess was correct?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance giggled. \"If it weren't for your correct guess and the unique things you said earlier, do you think I would have been at a disadvantage in our conversation? Yes, you guessed correctly. Dark Heavenly Fragrance and Life Goddess Kao are one and the same. I am her, and she is me. In the Realm of Life, it's Kao, and in this Realm of Death, it's me, Dark Heavenly Fragrance. You can call me Tian Xiang from now on. That is my name.\"\n\nNian Bing felt a wave of dizziness. He never expected that his random guess would lead to such a result. Dark Heavenly Fragrance no longer had any reason to lie to him; what she said was true. So, was it Kao and her he had kissed earlier?\n\n\"You... you and Kao look completely different, how can you be the same person? Have you been changing all along?\" Nian Bing found it hard to accept this fact. Although he had previously stated during his explanation that death energy and life energy could transform into each other to a certain extent, facing such a situation, he still found it difficult to accept.\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance smiled slightly. \"You can think whatever you want. Although it's not as simple as you say, my energy and Kao's can indeed be converted. However, we are two people, not one. Our true title should be the Gods of Emotion. Sometimes she is her, sometimes I am her, sometimes I am her, sometimes I am me.\"\n\nLooking at Nian Bing's puzzled face, Dark Heavenly Fragrance continued, \"Do you want to hear our story? Since you are the first object of our intimacy, I'll tell you.\"\n\nAlthough Nian Bing's heart was filled with questions, his tension gradually eased. At least, he no longer felt any hostility from Dark Heavenly Fragrance. He smiled slightly. \"Alright then, I also want to hear what secrets lie between your life and death. Oh, when I saw you earlier, you were clearly a bird, and I heard people say you are one of the Four Great Divine Beasts of the Divine Continent.\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance chuckled. \"What Four Great Divine Beasts? I'm not a divine beast at all. You were right at the beginning; that was the appearance of a phoenix. However, to distinguish myself from the phoenix, I can turn my head black. Divine beasts can transform into human form after cultivating to a certain level. Why can't humans transform into the appearance of divine beasts?\"\n\nNian Bing looked at her in surprise. \"Are you saying you can transform into a phoenix to deceive people?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance smiled faintly. \"Is there any need for that? Who do I need to deceive? It's just that I like to transform into that appearance, and I've been seen while changing. Anyway, let's not talk about this for now. After you hear our story, you'll naturally understand everything. As Gods of Emotion, Kao and I are separate existences, but also coexist. Do you understand?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred. \"The same body, shared soul, each possessing different abilities, right?\" Perhaps others wouldn't think of it, but he had experienced something similar before.\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance nodded approvingly. \"Indeed. Just as you said, we share a soul within this body. Originally, my current appearance is our true form, but Kao insisted on taking on a different form to distinguish herself from me, which is simply ugly. Kao and I are symbiotes by nature. If we talk about age, perhaps there's no one older than us in this world. Tens of thousands of years have passed in the blink of an eye, and we have seen too much of everything in the world.\"\n\nNian Bing couldn't help but ask, \"Then who exactly are you? And why have you lived for so long? Even the Dragon race probably cannot live for tens of thousands of years, right?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance replied, \"That's right. Even the Dragon race generally doesn't live past twenty-five thousand years, while Kao and I have lived in this world for nearly fifty thousand years. We call ourselves the Seven-Day Gods of Emotion. Every seven days, we switch roles. Seven days ago, it was her, and seven days from now, it will be me. Transforming between life and death has resulted in our current appearance. Our souls each occupy half of this body. Neither can destroy the other, but neither can submit to the other. Therefore, only through this method can we maintain our symbiotic state. Although we are symbiotic, we can still perceive everything happening externally when the other controls the body. Thus, from the moment you stepped into the Realm of Life, I already knew you. Even everything that happened on your journey was seen by me and Kao. We never expected that you would be able to gain the help of those dwarves, and such sincere help at that. Along the way, you have passed Kao's test. We do not save people easily. Only when you pass the tests of both of us will we help you restore your vitality. Now you should understand why Kao asked you to find me here.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly. \"Then do I count as passing your test?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance's pretty face blushed slightly. \"What do you think? You were able to injure me in various forms, which hasn't happened in tens of thousands of years. Feeling the pain after such a long time caused my mind to falter, giving Kao an opportunity to take control of the body prematurely.\" She chuckled at this point. \"Unfortunately, man proposes, but fate disposes. She probably never expected that you would do such a thing, actually... As a result, she lost control of her mind even more than I did. After struggling for a while, I managed to regain control of the body. I'm afraid she won't be able to contend with me for at least another ten days. You are truly amazing; it's obvious you have a lot of experience in this area.\"\n\nNian Bing forced a bitter smile. \"Experience, perhaps I do have some. I wasn't this ugly originally. Do girls just like novelty? Dark Heavenly Fragrance, I'm very curious about the origins of you Four Great True Gods. Since you and Kao have lived for nearly fifty thousand years, the other true gods should be around the same age, right? If so, what exactly are you? Can you tell me?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance naturally took Nian Bing's hand. In terms of appearance, she was even superior to Feng Nu and Bing Yun. Especially her alluring gaze and the perfect coordination with her body; every simple movement exuded a powerful charm. The moment her cool, small hand grasped his, Nian Bing's entire body trembled. Fortunately, he was already a zombie; otherwise, his heart rate would have at least doubled.\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance pulled Nian Bing down to sit. \"Don't worry about your blade. The Lake of Death is only beneficial for pure spirits of the dead like it. However, your blade soul is very strange. I've seen divine artifacts before, but this is the first time I've seen a blade soul with such spirituality. Moreover, through my mental power exploration, it seems to possess memory. Be careful yourself. The God of Order and I, although we are all human, have transcended human existence through technology. The world was destroyed in a war of technology, and we became one of the main culprits responsible for destroying technology. When everything fell silent, and the world was almost entirely covered by oceans, we all fell into a deep sleep, slumbering for thirty thousand years.\"\n\n\"Thirty thousand years?\" Nian Bing stared blankly at Dark Heavenly Fragrance. Even with his intelligence, he couldn't comprehend what she was saying. What was technology? What did it mean to be covered by oceans?\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance smiled slightly. \"Don't say you can't understand; even I don't fully grasp it. When we, the ultimate weapons of the Gods' final war, appeared, the world was already on the brink of collapse. All we knew was knowledge directly transmitted to our brains. However, we possessed too much wisdom and had great autonomy, which allowed us to survive when the world was about to end. Thirty thousand years later, when we awakened from our slumber, we discovered that the world had completely changed. Most of the original continent had been swallowed by the oceans, leaving only a small portion. These are the three continents you know: Yangguang Continent, the Lost Continent, and the Divine Continent. Yangguang Continent is the largest in area, followed by the Lost Continent, while the Divine Continent is much smaller. The reason the Divine Continent has its current environment and so many divine beasts is due to the various radiations left behind after the human war of destruction fifty thousand years ago. After three thousand years of evolution, the surviving creatures managed to survive, but the environment of the Divine Continent could not be changed in any way. The composition of the air changed drastically, ushering in the era later known as the Age of Magic. The Lost Continent was less affected than the Divine Continent. The radiation only increased the number of divine beasts and led to the emergence of a few mutated races, such as the Dragon race, the Dwarf race, and the Elf race, which evolved over many years after radiation exposure. The least affected was the Yangguang Continent, which largely retained its original human appearance. It is where humanity, starting from primitive society, has developed and progressed to its current state. Yangguang Continent can be said to be humanity's last pure land. Kao and I, along with those three fellows, fought almost every thousand years, but we all knew that human society could not withstand any more baptism. Therefore, we chose the depths of the ocean as our battlegrounds. After another ten thousand years, the Lost Empire could no longer tolerate the enslavement by the people of the Divine Continent and initiated a war, known as the War of the Gods and the Lost. The war lasted a long time and was very brutal, but it was a war among humans, and we prehistoric people did not participate. However, at the final moment, a major event occurred on the Lost Continent, which was also the root cause of their ultimate destruction. Although the so-called Gods of the Divine Continent were detestable, what the Lost Continent did was too extreme, compelling the other three fellows to join forces to destroy the Lost Empire. Otherwise, this world would truly cease to exist.\"\n\nNian Bing listened to this epic description, his brain working rapidly. Although he didn't fully understand, he was doing his best to accept the story Dark Heavenly Fragrance was telling. At this moment, he had a general outline in his mind, and at least he had a rough sense of what Dark Heavenly Fragrance was trying to convey. Judging by her words, there was a special reason for the destruction of the Lost Empire.\n\nBefore Nian Bing could ask, Dark Heavenly Fragrance took the initiative to speak. \"Originally, beings like us would not participate in the war between the Lost Empire and the Divine Continent. However, as the war was nearing its end, the Lost Empire discovered something that could destroy the entire Divine Continent. It was not the power of humans, but something left over from prehistoric times, a neutron bomb with immense energy. You don't need to know what it is, just know its power. The Lost Continent discovered some prehistoric civilizations, and using certain genetic principles, they cultivated Lost Warriors. At the same time, from the prehistoric data they found, they learned of the neutron bomb's power. They believed that the explosion of the neutron bomb would be enough to destroy the Divine Continent, and then no gods of the Divine Continent would be able to threaten them. Although they didn't know how to use this bomb, they could detonate it with magic. Therefore, they sent a group of people to secretly bring the neutron bomb to the Divine Continent. These individuals were all powerful at first, and they defeated the remaining gods relentlessly. Some high-ranking gods, who were the ones guiding our existence, thus appealed to us for help at the last moment. Originally, we would not have meddled in such affairs, but when we saw that neutron bomb, we had no choice but to get involved. The God of Destruction, the God of Time, and the God of Order immediately took action. When those Lost Empire warriors were annihilated, they seemed to have sensed our fear of the neutron bomb and thus threatened that there were similar items in the Lost Empire. Little did they know that this threat-laden statement completely enraged those three fellows. You must know that this planet, where we reside, was already very fragile due to prehistoric wars. Only these three interconnected continents were suitable for human survival. If the neutron bomb exploded, even just one, it could potentially cause the entire planet to collapse, and then human civilization would truly perish, with no one able to survive. Therefore, those three fellows finally agreed to the gods' request and prepared to completely destroy the Lost Empire. At that time, Kao and I could see that the other side was merely putting on a brave face in their dying moments, and perhaps there was no such thing on the Lost Continent. However, the God of Destruction said that even if there was a slight possibility, it had to be avoided, and they could not risk the planet's destruction to forgive those humans. After Kao and I argued vehemently, they finally agreed to send away the Lost Continent, which contained the most prehistoric civilization, instead of destroying it. Therefore, the ones who finally sent away the continent were not just the three of them; Kao and I also participated, although we were providing them with power from the shadows. With the combined strength of five of us, a temporal transfer was completed.\"",

    "title": "Chapter 175: The Promise in Front of the Death Waterfall (full)",
    "content": "The content from earlier will be added tonight.\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance tapped on the dark green scales on Nian Bing's body and smiled slightly, saying, \"They're quite sturdy, but they'll disappear soon. You were so arrogant before, so consider this me getting personal revenge. You'll have to bear with it.\" As soon as she finished her last word, Dark Heavenly Fragrance moved. Her body turned into a black shadow, spinning lightly around Nian Bing. Her ten fingers moved with the agility of ten living snakes, creating a soft melody as they constantly flicked in front of Nian Bing. With each flick, her fingers lightly touched him.\n\nThe seemingly slight touches gave Nian Bing a completely different feeling, not pain, but a crisp sound, the sound of scales shattering. Nian Bing's zombie body couldn't feel pain, but with each light tap from Heavenly Fragrance, a bone-penetrating force seeped into his body, not only destroying the outer scales but also damaging his muscles, meridians, and bones. What would it feel like to hear one's own bones shatter? Perhaps only those who have truly heard it would know. Even though it didn't hurt, it placed immense mental pressure on him.\n\nNian Bing's body gradually softened. With the shattering of his bones and meridians, the surging death aura was the only thing supporting him from collapsing. The cool airflow fully integrated into Nian Bing's body. He closed his eyes, enduring the discomfort of his heartbeat. Everything was enveloped by the death aura. Heavenly Fragrance's body twisted strangely in the air and somehow merged into Nian Bing's body. His spiritual power surged violently, and countless streams of energy rushed towards Nian Bing's brain from all directions. With a flash of light, Nian Bing reappeared. The scales on his body had completely vanished. He was suspended naked above the center of the Death Lake. The Death Lake seemed to be boiling, its waters constantly churning. The densest death aura in layers transformed into cone-shaped gray lights, continuously surging into Nian Bing's body.\n\nEverything was constantly changing. Heavenly Fragrance floated about thirty feet away from Nian Bing, watching him. Occasionally, she moved slightly, directing the death aura to gather towards Nian Bing. Time ticked by. Apart from the spiritual power protecting his Heavenly Eye acupoint, Nian Bing's body had transformed from a zombie into a true undead spirit of death. Even the Shadow Puppet had merged with the Devouring Devil Blade within his body under Heavenly Fragrance's control. After the process of destruction and reconstruction, the intense impact of death energy had consumed over eighty percent of Nian Bing's spiritual power. However, accustomed to enduring pain, he persevered.\n\nA slight stinging sensation spread through his body. Nian Bing was surprised to find that the feeling he had been pushing for days had returned. Although he still lacked life aura, he now felt human again. Gray meridians clearly appeared, and surging energy continuously flowed from the Li Zhong acupoint in his chest into every part of his body. That was the familiar innate energy! It seemed that the current innate energy had completely fused with the death aura, with no mutual rejection, constantly circulating within Nian Bing's body. The external death aura had transformed into innate energy, continuously permeating from outside to inside. This innate energy was not controlled by Nian Bing but was constantly integrating with his body. The Devouring Devil Blade floated out from Nian Bing's body, suspended before him with a black aura. Nian Bing clearly saw a black energy ball gradually forming in his chest and abdomen. That familiar aura, wasn't it dark magic! He was overjoyed; not only did he regain sensation, but he also regained magic. How wonderful!\n\nUnfortunately, this was the Death God's Waterfall, and below it was the Death God's Lake. There were no other elemental magic elements, so what he had regained was only dark magic.\n\n\"Alright, you can relax now. The continuous remodeling phase begins. Go to sleep. When you wake up, everything will be better,\" Heavenly Fragrance's gentle voice echoed in Nian Bing's mind. The raging innate energy within him suddenly softened, his spirit gradually relaxed, and drowsiness swept over his brain. Nian Bing felt his surroundings become illusory. His body had entered a moist world, and under the embrace of sleepiness, he gradually lost consciousness. His last feeling was that he, the magician, had sunk into the Death God's Lake.\n\nWatching Nian Bing sink into the lake, Dark Heavenly Fragrance couldn't help but reveal a faint smile. She murmured to herself, \"This silly boy, his will isn't firm. It turns out kissing between people has such a wonderful feeling. I really want him to kiss me like that again.\" Heavenly Fragrance's pretty face flushed slightly, making her look a bit more lively. The intense stimulation from that kiss hadn't just affected the God of Life, Kao, but also her. Moreover, the stimulation she received was no less than Kao's. Otherwise, she wouldn't have revealed all the secrets in her heart. Heavenly Fragrance, who had always longed for a normal life, became even more yearning for ordinary life through her contact with Nian Bing. A large part of the reason she didn't allow gods to set foot on the Yangguang Continent was for their future. Although the Gods of Destruction, Time, and Order had different ideas from hers, they were unwilling to offend this God of Emotions too deeply before a winner was decided. That was why the Yangguang Continent had maintained its peace all these years. Heavenly Fragrance drifted to float directly above where Nian Bing was sinking. She slowly spread her arms to her sides. The water level of the Death God's Lake continuously rose, while the Death God's Waterfall stopped flowing. The water of the Death God's Lake gradually formed a giant water sphere. Heavenly Fragrance flickered and drilled into the center of the water sphere, embracing the unconscious Nian Bing with a layer of black airflow, completely enveloping their bodies. They allowed the vast death aura around them to constantly invade. The gray light underwent a gradual transition from gray to black.\n\n...\n\nYangguang Continent, Cold Ridge.\n\nFour beams of light continuously changed their forms in the air. The naked eye couldn't discern their movements; only two red and two blue lights could be seen flashing and colliding in the air.\n\nThe magic elements in the air fluctuated violently, and the aura of ice and fire permeated the uninhabited Cold Ridge. The four energies condensed and did not disperse in the air. With every attack or defense, they brought about intense bursts of light. Although the condensed magical power did not destroy everything around them, the distortion of the air indicated how immense these energies were.\n\nThe four beams of light, two red and two blue, shuttled through the air, exceptionally striking. Judging from the intensity and volume of the light, one red beam was clearly rougher and much weaker in intensity than the other three. This was particularly evident in control, which was clearly less precise than the other three beams. Among the other three beams, one blue beam was slightly weaker, but its control was extremely exquisite, often managing to avoid the sharp edges of other beams and attack from tricky positions, achieving unexpected effects.\n\n\"I'm not playing anymore. It's not fair.\" The red light receded, and the weakest red beam flew out of the battle circle, revealing itself to the side. Pouting, with a dissatisfied expression, it was none other than the delicate and hot-tempered Xue Jing.\n\nSeeing her stop, the other three beams of light also dispersed, revealing their true forms. The two strongest beams were naturally the sisters Feng Nu and Lan Chen. The slightly weaker blue beam was Long Ling.\n\nXue Jing looked at the three women and said aggrievedly, \"It's too unfair! You have the Heavenly Eye acupoint, so controlling energy is as easy as picking something up from your palm. I can't do that. I finally managed to pester Galanmatis to help me advance to the Martial Saint realm, but I'm still so far behind you all. It's not fun; I want to open the Heavenly Eye acupoint too.\"\n\nLong Ling descended before Xue Jing, supported by a condensed blizzard under her feet. \"Jing Jing, don't throw a childish tantrum. Didn't Big Brother Galanmatis say that the Heavenly Eye acupoint is the most difficult acupoint to open among humans? You must proceed step by step and be careful not to get possessed.\"\n\nXue Jing looked at Long Ling's concerned expression and couldn't help but chuckle. \"Okay, okay, do you think I'm really angry? Although I'm much worse than you, I've made the most progress during this time. Alas, I'm really jealous of you! That fellow Nian Bing actually used his life force to help you open your acupoints. I really don't know what he was thinking.\" As soon as she spoke, she felt something was amiss. Her voice clearly lowered on the last sentence, but with Long Ling, Feng Nu, and Lan Chen's abilities, how could they not hear it?\n\nLong Ling's expression dimmed for a moment. \"If Nian Bing could stay by our side, I'd rather not have this Heavenly Eye acupoint. He's been gone for half a year, and there's not a single piece of news.\"\n\nXue Jing apologized, \"I'm sorry, Ling'er. It was my fault for speaking too much. Don't worry, how could Nian Bing bear to leave you all? He will definitely come back alive. He consumed so much energy; healing takes time! Don't worry too much. I believe you'll see him soon.\"\n\nFeng Nu walked to Long Ling's side, like an elder sister, and put her arm around her shoulder, smiling. \"Jing Jing is right. Nian Bing will definitely return. Alright, let's continue our training, Ling'er. Don't forget our goal.\"\n\nLong Ling raised her head, her eyes filled with determination. She nodded vigorously twice. \"I won't forget. I will never forget. Okay, let's start again.\" She chanted a few incantations in a low voice, and her blue light instantly strengthened. A silver line of light lit up on her forehead, and under the effect of the blizzard, she flew into the air once more.\n\nHalf a year had passed, and the women had been continuously cultivating under the guidance of the Dragon Kings. The most diligent magician, Long Ling, although appearing delicate on the outside, was extremely resolute on the inside. She knew her strength was far inferior to Feng Nu and Lan Chen, so she cultivated even harder. In just half a year, with the nourishment of Angel's Tear, the opening of the Heavenly Eye acupoint, and her own continuous efforts, she had now reached the level of a Magus, even opening her innate domain. Her strength had improved significantly. Although she still couldn't compare to Feng Nu and her sister, the gap had narrowed considerably.\n\nFeng Nu's progress was the most stable. She was already the strongest among the women. The opening of her Heavenly Eye acupoint was equivalent to opening a grand door to cultivation. Over the past half-year, she had leaped forward and cultivated the Nine Transformations of the Phoenix to the early fifth transformation, a speed she herself found hard to believe. Although Lan Chen didn't practice martial arts, under Feng Nu's guidance, she combined the secret techniques of the Phoenix clan with her Ice Phoenix physique, forging a new path and integrating it with ice magic, causing her Ice Goddess domain to undergo earth-shattering changes. The intensity of her ice magic had also greatly increased due to the remodeling of her Angel's Tear body. Among the three women, only she had had a relationship with Nian Bing. Nian Bing had benefited greatly in his magic cultivation from Lan Chen's virgin Ice Phoenix body. Unfortunately, he had directly used the Life Curse magic and hadn't had time to realize these benefits before turning into a zombie. But Lan Chen was different. She had obtained Nian Bing's virgin body, which also brought her immense benefits. Through diligent cultivation during this period, her overall strength had become comparable to Feng Nu's. If the two women joined forces, without the Dragon Kings using their ultimate Dragon Language magic, neither Dragon King would be their match.\n\nWatching the three women continue to cultivate diligently, Xue Jing muttered to herself, \"They've all gone crazy. Every day, from meditation to combat, they don't give themselves any rest. It seems I should give them my title of 'crazy woman'! Hmph, that scoundrel Galanmatis, he's not even thinking of helping me open an acupoint. I'm going to find him to settle this.\" She was unwilling to admit that she simply missed that fire dragon after not seeing him since breakfast.\n\nThe aerial combat continued until Long Ling exhausted all her magical power and stopped. Feng Nu and her sister, along with Long Ling, sat together, absorbing the innate energy from the air while discussing their experiences and insights from the day's combat. Cultivating together made it much easier for the three women to improve than cultivating alone.\n\n\"Sister, when are we going to make a move? I think our current abilities are almost there. If we can sneak into the Ice God's Tower, there's a high chance we can rescue Uncle and Aunt,\" after leaving the Ice God's Tower, Lan Chen had changed her address for Nian Bing's parents because of Nian Bing.\n\nFeng Nu shook her head and said, \"Chen'er, we can't be hasty. We must ask for help, but we need to cultivate even harder. The Ice Goddess Priestess has been a Divine Descendant for many years. I heard from Big Brother Galanmatis that she has opened three more acupoints. Even if the three of us join forces, we won't be a match for her, let alone safely bringing Uncle and Aunt out of there. Therefore, we must have greater confidence. Let's wait another half a year. We'll cultivate diligently for another half-year, and our strength should improve to another level. At that time, if Nian Bing still hasn't returned, we'll make our move.\"\n\nLong Ling lowered her head, her voice choked with emotion. \"Sister Feng, if... if Nian Bing really can't come back, then what do we do...\"",

    "content": "Feng Nu smiled faintly and said, \"Ling'er, believe in Nian Bing. For us, for his parents whom he always thinks of, he will definitely come back. Even if he doesn't, will our hearts still change? If that day truly comes, we will help Nian Bing fulfill all his unfinished wishes, then take Uncle and Aunt to find a place to live in seclusion and wait for him, wait for him forever.\" There was no one among them who would persuade them to stop waiting, because they all understood that no matter which one of them it was, they could not let go of this unforgettable love. Among the three women, Long Ling should have the shallowest feelings for Nian Bing. She had barely been with Nian Bing in a true sense, but even in Nian Bing's final release of his spiritual power, he did not forget her. With his last bit of energy, he transmitted it from a distance, and that drop of Angel's Tear had made her deeply certain of Nian Bing's feelings for her, and that was enough.\n\nOn the summit of Green Mountain, a giant cone-shaped cavity was inverted, shaped like the peak of a volcano. Everything around it appeared so silent. Unlike the green of the mountain, within this cone-shaped pit, which was a hundred feet deep, everything was gray, even the sky above the summit.\n\nFloating quietly above the cone-shaped pit was a figure. Ripples of death continuously spread outwards from that figure. Those pale gray beams of light were balanced and soothing in rhythm, and the energy fluctuations in the air appeared so harmonious, which was almost a miracle on the Continent of Gods. If anyone were to examine the energy elements in the sky with spiritual power at that moment, they would clearly see that after the aura of death dissipated and became formless, it would return after a while. Each dark element filled with death would absorb one water, fire, earth, wind, space, and light element, and then fuse with the proud figure at the center. Not a single dark element returned empty-handed. Centered around Green Mountain, due to the excessive loss of magical elements, even though the distant surroundings were being swept by the magical storm, it had always been peaceful here, and all of this was because of the tall figure in the air.\n\nThe release of the death ripples finally stopped. An hour later, the seemingly eternal figure in the air finally changed. A pair of black eyes slowly opened. They were very ordinary eyes, with nothing but calm in their gaze. There was not a trace of energy fluctuation. His black eyes gradually deepened.\n\n\"She actually gave all of this to me. It seems I have truly been reborn. Although it's not complete yet, this is a good start.\" A faint smile appeared on his face, Nian Bing said to himself. Gazing at the dense dark clouds in the sky, a faint gray layer appeared on his newly fair skin. The gray flashed and disappeared, and everything returned to normal. He raised his hand and gently stroked a faint gray mark on his brow, his smile deepening, \"So, the true domain is here.\"\n\nRaising his left hand, a black light floated out of his body and hovered quietly in front of him. The narrow and long blade exuded a layer of dark red patterns. The originally black gem on the hilt had turned dark red, and the blood-devouring aura was filled with an overbearing intent.\n\n\"Come out. I think we should have a good talk,\" Nian Bing said calmly to the Devouring Blood Saber, as if he were facing a person, not a saber.\n\nA bolt of black lightning floated out from the hilt. The saber remained suspended there, while in front of Nian Bing, there was another Nian Bing, entirely covered in black clothing. He looked at the naked Nian Bing and nodded, saying, \"You finally know.\"\n\n\"I should know.\" Nian Bing smiled, his gaze very kind.\n\n\"Yes! You should know. However, I really didn't expect that the one I chose to inherit Devouring Blood would be so powerful. No, I should say, become so powerful so quickly. Only someone like you, who possesses true darkness, is worthy of wielding this Devouring Blood Saber, isn't that right?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"You are mistaken about one thing. I am not the one who has mastered true darkness. I have only mastered the secret of death. Death and darkness are not the same concept. Don't forget my identity. I am just a magician, no, I should say a magic chef. Can you tell me everything that happened back then? I really want to know about you, Your Excellency Hei Wu Huang.\"\n\nYes, that Nian Bing's shadow puppet was Hei Wu Huang. After Nian Bing entered the true domain of darkness, he had fully understood this.\n\nHei Wu Huang's expression was very calm, \"Of course. Now, you are not only the owner of the Devouring Blood Saber, but you can also be considered my master. Among the seven of us back then, I was the only exception, because I was not a cultivator from the Continent of Yanggu in the first place. This Continent of Gods, this was the place I once lived. It is precisely because I left from this continent that I knew the preciousness of power and understood that strength is everything. The weather on the Continent of Yanggu is not as harsh as on the Continent of Gods, so to become stronger, I had to constantly challenge the strong. Only then could I become stronger, and only then could I one day return to this continent with my head held high.\n\nNian Bing looked at him with some surprise, \"Then, if that's the case, you should be one of the divine beings here.\"\n\nHei Wu Huang nodded and said, \"Yes, when I left here, I was already close to the realm of a demigod. It's just that because I later chose a different cultivation path, I was expelled from here. The so-called divine beings are just some sanctimonious fellows. They outwardly do not accept people who cultivate dark abilities, but what about them in secret? Are their despicable methods any better than mine, who cultivates darkness? I exiled myself just to regain some dignity. After arriving on the Continent of Yanggu, I met those six people, the six people you know. Among the seven of us, I was the strongest. Although later, the gods, fearing that I would reveal matters of the Continent of Gods, brought down divine punishment upon me, could they really kill me? Even Safin could think of a way to escape, let alone me? At that time, I was no longer just a dark-attribute divine master. Even the Dark Dragon King had been defeated by me. My dark ability had reached the thirteenth level. Three acupoints were opened, one ultimate and two mid-level. I did not die even when facing the strongest power of divine punishment.\"\n\n\"Abandoning the physical body, using the soul as the saber, am I correct?\" Nian Bing suddenly interjected.\n\nHei Wu Huang nodded and said, \"That's right, exactly. The Devouring Blood Saber is a divine artifact. Because of my soul, it has changed, transforming into a divine artifact. The moment you awakened my soul with your blood, this Devouring Blood Saber underwent a fundamental change, and your innate qi with a dark aura also allowed me to possess a body again. Although the body is in an energy form, for me, it is already enough. Safin chose to abandon his physical body for his life, while I abandoned my physical body to become stronger. Even if I can only have the saber as my main body and energy as the carrier of my soul, I will still be the strongest saber.\" His domineering words were filled with a craving for power, a choice that was almost insane. But Nian Bing, who had deeply experienced this, understood Hei Wu Huang's desire to win.\n\nLooking at Hei Wu Huang, who had the same appearance as him but a completely different demeanor, and then at the Devouring Blood Saber with its flashing dark red patterns, Nian Bing said, \"Alright, I understand. Your pursuit is the peak of strength. Now, you are completely integrated with the Devouring Blood Saber, creating this divine artifact. From now on, we are friends, partners.\"\n\n\"Partners? Although I have helped you, you must understand that I am also helping myself. Only by absorbing a large amount of dark and death aura can I separate my spiritual body from the saber body, not only reviving my soul but also allowing myself to gradually recover my strength. Moreover, I have been awake for a long time, but I didn't tell you. Aren't you even a little bit suspicious?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Should I be suspicious? That was in the past. In a sense, both you and I are reborn. Let the past be the past. The words I have spoken will not be taken back. We are brothers. I just want to know how much of your strength has been recovered now.\"\n\nHei Wu Huang smiled faintly and said, \"A good saying, 'Let the past be the past.' Yes! Perhaps, I should really be reborn with you forever. My strength has recovered to its previous state after being baptized by the death energy here. Although the Dark Dragon King has been constantly improving over the years, I have a few percent confidence that I can fight him to a draw. When you need me, I will be your support, and at the same time, I will unceremoniously absorb the dark and death aura based on you. Your business here is completed. Before that woman left, she also helped me collect the other three dark magical beasts that were originally guarding Green Mountain into this Devouring Blood Saber and asked me to convey a message to you: return to the starting point where you came from.\" A black light flashed, and Hei Wu Huang merged back into the saber. The Devouring Blood Saber flipped in the air and fell into Nian Bing's grasp.\n\nHolding the Devouring Blood Saber, Nian Bing stretched his body vigorously, and a comfortable feeling spread throughout his body. He still had no vitality, and even his original darkness had turned into complete death, but now he had a real feeling, a feeling like an ordinary person. His skin was no longer so stiff, but filled with elasticity. Apart from his skin color being slightly paler, from the outside, there was no difference between him and an ordinary person. More importantly, Nian Bing had now regained the thing he needed most, which was magic.\n\nHis figure flashed, and he floated to the edge of Green Mountain's summit. He took a deep look at the Death Spring Eye, where no more Death Water was flowing. A gentle breeze blew, carrying Nian Bing's body and descending, heading into the distance. Nian Bing knew very well how long he had stayed here – half a year! In half a year, he had gained three things on the surface: first, he regained the feeling of being human; second, he regained his magic; and third, he thoroughly understood the meaning of death. With just these three things, his strength had not improved as expected, and everything remained at the original level. It was just that, unknowingly, Nian Bing felt that he had changed a little, a change from his body. Unfortunately, he could only feel the partial meaning of these changes. Perhaps, only by returning to the starting point would he understand all the changes.\n\nAs he flew forward, Nian Bing's heart was in a turmoil, because he knew that upon returning to the starting point where he came from, he would not be facing Dark Tian Xiang, but the Goddess of Life whom he had lost control of his body after that unintentional kiss. Would she let him off easily and help him recover his life? It was probably very difficult.\n\nForget it. Since Dark Tian Xiang and Kao had chosen him, then she couldn't truly make things difficult for him, could she? Couldn't she take action to see Xie Lu and the other dwarf seniors? And also retrieve his six divine sabers. Thinking of this, Nian Bing's flying body suddenly accelerated, and he flew rapidly towards the direction he came from.\n\nHe had only flown for a short while when suddenly, the dark clouds in the sky changed. As the clouds rubbed against each other, the sky suddenly lit up. Nian Bing suddenly felt an unprecedentedly huge pressure coming from the sky. With rumbling thunder, although his Heavenly Eye Acupoint felt the change in the sky, how could a person's speed be faster than lightning?\n\n\"Don't be so unlucky.\" This was the only thought Nian Bing had. Oh, no, it should be called a loss.\n\nA body emitting black smoke and carrying a burnt smell floated towards the ground. The moment it collided with the ground, a ball of milky white light emerged from this body, slowing down some of the impact on the grass.\n\nBoom—\n\nLying quietly on the ground, Nian Bing finally understood why he had rarely seen anyone flying since he arrived on this Continent of Gods. It turned out that the consequence of flying here was probably only one: having an intimate encounter with heavenly lightning. Perhaps, only those at the level of Kao and Tian Xiang would not be affected by the lightning.\n\nWhat it felt like to be struck by lightning could only be understood through experience. A numb feeling spread to every cell in his body, and his entire body was trembling slightly. The meridians and blood within his body also experienced a momentary stagnation.\n\nNian Bing discovered that he was indeed very resilient. After being struck by lightning like this, he didn't seem to be badly hurt. The numb feeling gradually disappeared. Apart from being completely black, and his pitiful long hair turned to ashes, there were no major concerns. He was unharmed.\n\nNo wonder Xie Lu said he was abnormal. He was indeed abnormal! Could it be that the Azure Dragon Scale that Tian Xiang had shattered on his body back then had not disappeared, but had merged into his skin?\n\nHis meridians and blood were reborn in the death aura. After being struck by lightning once, Nian Bing actually felt much more comfortable. Even his blood became much smoother. He didn't need to control his magical power at all. The ice element transformed into water element, cooperating with the light element to nourish his body. As for other magical elements, they all shrank together. Nian Bing watched as these two magical elements dispelled the scorched blackness on his body and the effects of the lightning.\n\nWas being struck by lightning so comfortable? Would he die if he were struck a few more times? The answer was unknown. Nian Bing decided that as soon as his body recovered, he would walk. He would not fly again until he found a way to counter heavenly lightning. He believed that on the Continent of Gods, there must be a way to avoid heavenly lightning in the sky, otherwise, why was the Dragon God fine when he flew back then?\n\nJust as Nian Bing was waiting for his body to recover, he suddenly sensed two airflow currents rapidly approaching him. He didn't hear this with his ears or see it with his eyes, but felt it from his Heavenly Eye Acupoint.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, and a faint glint appeared in his eyes. He carefully extended his spiritual power into the ground, then expanded it rapidly, not much slower than lightning. He easily captured those two auras. They were human auras. Nian Bing understood that for the first time since arriving on the Continent of Gods, he had encountered divine beings.\n\n\"Jie Shang, that guy who was struck should be nearby. Let's search carefully. Do you sense his aura?\" a somewhat sharp voice sounded.\n\nAnother deeper voice replied, \"No, I can only sense his location based on the changes in magical elements in the air. He should be not far away. Let's search carefully, we should find him. Hopefully, that guy who was struck has some good stuff on him.\"\n\n\"It's been a long time since we've seen such a fool. Over the years, we gods have become more and more cunning, and we understand the environment of the continent better. We don't do things we're not confident about. It hasn't been easy to find targets these years. This time, we've gotten lucky. Even if that guy has nothing good on him, we can still have a good meal. We haven't eaten meat in a long time. The number of green lizards seems to have decreased, and most of them have been occupied by those powerful gods. Even with our status as demigods, we can't even eat enough. If it weren't for the order prohibiting us from leaving the Continent of Gods, I would have gone to the Continent of Yanggu long ago. There, with our strength, we wouldn't be much different from being called gods, would we? As far as I know, demigods like us are a bit stronger than Magus Masters and Martial Saints over there, and there should be no higher-level experts on the Continent of Yanggu.\"\n\n\"Alas, Na Du, do you think you are the only one who wants to go? As long as one is a divine being, everyone wants to go there. I don't know what those few main gods are thinking. They actually keep restricting us. Besides, the barrier surrounding the continent is not something we can break through, otherwise, I would have slipped away long ago and waited until now?\" Jie Shang's deep voice held a bit more anger.\n\nNa Du snorted and said, \"It's not that there's no opportunity. I heard that the legendary Seal Bottle of Muoda Si was left on the Continent of Yanggu and guarded by the Seven Dragon Kings. Now, those seven divine-level Dragon Kings have lost the bottle, and the situation seems very bad. Several main gods are discussing sending people to find the bottle and recruit experts from the Continent of Yanggu to join our Continent of Gods, so that we can be prepared for the return of the Lost Continent at any time. No one knows the situation of the Lost Continent. If the Lost Continent has been developing for these tens of thousands of years, then we might be in trouble.\"\n\nJie Shang said, \"Even if they send someone to the Continent of Yanggu, they will probably send divine-level experts. It's not our turn.\"\n\nNa Du chuckled and said, \"It's not our turn, but can't we sneak over there? If someone goes, the seal will definitely be opened. At that time, we can try to find an opportunity. If we can slip out, and arrive on the Continent of Yanggu, we can live a life a hundred times better than before. From what I've heard, there are still many fools on the Continent of Yanggu who are diligently cultivating, wanting to come to our Continent of Gods. Hahahaha, I wonder what they would think if they really arrived here.\"\n\n\"Huh? Who are those two fighting? Let's not look for them yet, let's hide first.\" Jie Shang's voice was filled with surprise. Immediately after, Nian Bing clearly felt Na Du and Jie Shang's auras becoming much weaker, and they hid in the gap between a huge rock. While Jie Shang was surprised, Nian Bing had already sensed two other auras. Compared to Na Du and Jie Shang, these two auras were obviously much stronger.\n\nThe two energy masses they brought with them were constantly colliding violently, but despite the palpable immense energy fluctuations, there was no sound at all. One of these two auras gave Nian Bing a familiar feeling, a feeling that was indescribable, like a tacit understanding from the heart. Closing his eyes, Nian Bing recalled his spiritual power that had permeated the ground and instantly expanded its coverage. Immediately, his spiritual power acted like his eyes, clearly seeing everything that was happening in the direction of the energy fluctuations.\n\nThey were two masses of energy, one white and one green. The white light was steady, and the green light was graceful. The two masses of energy, from the ground to the sky, were constantly colliding. Because he was using spiritual power to probe, Nian Bing could clearly feel the extreme density of the two masses of energy when they attacked each other. Although the energy appeared to be small in volume, its explosive power was very strong. If they were compared to the cultivators on the Continent of Yanggu, there was no one who could match them. Suddenly, he understood why he had a familiar feeling. That familiarity came from the white light, and he also recognized who the owner of the white light was.\n\nIn the not-too-bright energy light, two figures, one green and one white, appeared very clearly. The white figure looked to be in his late forties, over two meters tall, with extremely broad shoulders. The dense aura of light gave his entire body a sacred feeling. Although his appearance could not be described as handsome, his righteous expression was definitely not fake; it was entirely an inner feeling. Nian Bing felt an overwhelming sense of shock. His strength was clearly inferior to that of the green light, but every attack carried a righteous aura, which actually allowed him to fight the green light to a draw.\n\nNian Bing suddenly realized that at their level, moves seemed to be unimportant. The two of them were competing in speed, energy application, and energy intensity. Neither side was suppressed by the other in terms of momentum. The one fighting the middle-aged man in white was a young man dressed in green. The young man was about Nian Bing's height, with a spirited head of short green hair. However, the light in his eyes looked very cold. His attack speed was clearly much faster than the man in white. With every attack, the surrounding air seemed to tear apart. The reason his attacks made no sound was because, centered on the point of attack, the surrounding space was torn to shreds, even isolating the sound. He moved his hands like swords, bringing out strands of green light several feet long, constantly circling the man in white, both above and below. Every attack was a flash and a retreat, but every attack felt so substantial, forcing the man in white to defend within a foot of his body. The milky white energy saber condensed by light elements in his hands, in the narrow space, could barely withstand the young man's offensive. Only when he occasionally launched a powerful attack to force the young man back could he get a moment to breathe. In terms of fighting spirit intensity, it was difficult to distinguish their strength. Although the green light was much stronger than the white light, it was not easy to break through the white light fighting spirit's defense. The battle moved from afar to near, slowly shifting towards Nian Bing's direction. Their battle had entered a stalemate.\n\n\"Good! Your sacred aura indeed has characteristics. However, I don't believe you can withstand my Wind God's Pierce. Be careful, here it comes!\" The green-clothed man's voice was exceptionally excited, and within his excitement, there was a cold killing intent. His body suddenly flickered in the air, and the light in his hands condensed into the form of two long swords. The green light immediately became rapid and sharp. With a flick of his hands, hundreds of green rays floated out, suddenly heading towards the man in white. As the green light moved through the air, everything around it was completely distorted, and it was impossible to discern the trajectory of their attacks.\n\nThe man in white, being able to contend with the green-clothed man all along, naturally had his own abilities. With a wave of his Sacred Light Saber, a milky white light curtain appeared in front of him. Then, three more light curtains appeared consecutively. Before those green rays could strike, the four milky white light curtains quickly intertwined, forming a shield of light.\n\nThe sound of \"chi chi chi chi\" continued to sound. Every sound caused the air to split apart, and the various magical elements in the air became violently agitated, especially the wind element, which became unusually ferocious. In the influence of the wind element surrounding the advancing green rays, the green rays were given rings of green vortexes, and the intensity of the wind stab greatly increased.\n\n\"Good come.\" The milky white long saber in the man in white's hand suddenly disappeared. He pushed forward with both hands without hesitation, propping up the four interlacing and flashing walls of light. At this moment, his eyes suddenly turned golden, and a sacred golden six-pointed star illusion appeared behind him. The aura of light elements clearly became more concentrated.\n\nAll sounds disappeared when the green and white light beams met, and even the two individuals fighting stopped. However, in the next moment, their bodies flashed past. The man in white's light shield turned into light spots and disappeared, while the Wind God's Pierces launched by the green-clothed man also disappeared within the light shield. Green and white light soared into the air, and the man in white and the man in green stood back-to-back, as if everything was over.\n\nThrough the sense of spiritual power, Nian Bing quickly understood who had the upper hand in this confrontation. Although the man in white was not weak, the green-clothed man's penetration attack method was truly overbearing. It was precisely because of this that the man in white's light shield did not completely block it, and a few green rays still attacked his front. It was just that at that moment, everything happened so quickly that Jie Shang and the other two, who were hiding nearby, did not notice.\n\n\"You lost. Hand it over,\" the green-clothed man said coldly.\n\n\"Lost? There is no such word in my dictionary. In my mind, there is only life and death. If you want something, unless you kill me, you will never get anything from me,\" the white-clothed man's voice was very steady, and at the same time, very firm, as if nothing could affect his resolve.\n\nThe green-clothed man slowly turned around, looking at the white-clothed man coldly. A hint of malice had appeared in his eyes, and his killing intent became even stronger, \"Don't think that just because a few main gods treat you well, you can be arrogant in front of me. I can also kill you without anyone noticing. Hand over the item, and I will spare your life.\"\n\nThe white-clothed man also turned around. His face was very calm, as if he had not suffered any harm at all, \"Then go ahead. You should know my temper. What's the use of talking such nonsense?\"",

    "content": "The man in green's eyes flashed with cold light, \"Do you really want me to kill you? Have you thought it through? A person's life only comes once.\"\n\nThe man in white smiled mockingly, \"You? Haven't we long ago called ourselves gods? We are no longer human. You're wasting so much breath on me, which isn't like you. It seems you have some reservations about them, don't you?\"\n\nThe man in green's anger flared, \"Fine. Since that's the case, I'll fulfill your wish. Let's see who can threaten me.\" The wind in the air began to spin rapidly, and blades of wind took shape. The previously flowing wind, after transforming into blades, actually condensed behind the man in green, showing no intention of moving, as if waiting for his command like puppets.\n\nThe man in white took a deep breath, \"Come, I want to see how strong you are, as a Repairer of the Main God, to be able to kill me.\"\n\n\"Haven't you seen enough? How strong do you think I am?\" The man in green's expression suddenly became calm. Experts of their level are no longer swayed by emotions. Once they engage in battle, they will dedicate themselves to it entirely.\n\nWhite light condensed in the man in white's hand, and the white light gradually transformed, becoming golden, a sacred golden. A golden saber was held in the man in white's still firm large hand. His expression became even more serious. He took a deep breath, faced the man in green before him, and slowly raised the Blade of Light in his hand.\n\nThe man in green snorted coldly, \"You have lost the purity of light. Even with the sacredness of light increasing your attack power, how can you block my Wind God's Power? You've witnessed my Wind God's Pierce, this time, I'll let you witness my Wind God's Slash.\" As he spoke, the dozen or so green lights behind him suddenly merged, and a semicircular giant wind blade floated above his head. Soon, the wind blade actually returned to the size of the previous wind blade, quietly suspended there. However, the green wind blade had now turned dark green. Nie Bing was all too familiar with this situation; it was a method of compression. It was just that the man in white was compressing battle qi, not magic.\n\nGreen battle qi continuously surged. The man in green raised his hand and grasped the inner edge of the wind blade, \"One last chance.\"\n\nThe man in white answered with his actions. The golden saber in his hand was raised high above his head. With a sharp shout, an illusionary golden light floated out, slashing towards the man in green.\n\nThe man in green snorted coldly and moved his finger. The dark green wind blade flew out without any suspense. The illusionary golden light was instantly torn into pieces by the physical wind blade, and it continued towards the man in white unchanged.\n\nThe man in white suddenly laughed. The golden saber in his hand dispersed into specks of golden light. He spat out a mouthful of blood, and those golden light spots, under the effect of the blood, actually turned into a golden-red color. Suddenly, they scattered outwards, dodging the attack of the dark green wind blade, and then converged again, rushing towards the man in green like a hundred birds returning to their nest.\n\n\"Blood Devouring Art! Impossible, how could you...\" He didn't have time to be surprised. Facing countless golden-red lights, his body immediately began to rotate rapidly, transforming into a tornado himself. He merged with those golden-red light spots, but this fusion was accompanied by explosions.\n\nThe man in white let out a burst of hearty laughter. Seeing the dark green wind blade arriving, he suddenly glared and shouted, fiercely punching forward with his right fist, with an unstoppable momentum, striking the center of the wind blade. Violent roars erupted from both sides simultaneously. The light and wind magical elements in the air fluctuated violently, and the energy of battle qi permeated the air. Deep marks appeared on the ground, as if their struggle had torn everything apart, including themselves, of course.\n\nAs the light subsided, the man in green barely floated about ten feet above the ground, gasping for breath. His green robe was already stained red with his own blood. At least seven bloody holes appeared on his shoulders, legs, and torso. Each blood hole looked small but were completely penetrating wounds. Although the wounds had been sealed by him using a special method, blood still flowed out. His originally cold face looked exceptionally pale, and the wind-element battle qi around his body fluctuated unstably, significantly weakened compared to before.\n\nThe man in white's condition was slightly worse than the man in green's. From his forehead all the way to his crotch, there was a deep bloody gash. The arm he used to block the dark green wind blade was gone, and his bloody and mangled shoulder was adorned with wisps of torn flesh. His body was covered with countless small wounds, turning him into a bloodied mess. The only thing that remained unchanged was his gaze. That resolute gaze showed no sign of surrender; instead, his fighting spirit had grown even stronger.\n\n\"Good, good, good. You actually went so far as to expend your true essence to deal with me like this. It seems I underestimated you,\" the man in green said, gasping and looking at the man in white resentfully.\n\nThe man in white said calmly, \"What does expending true essence matter? If you kill me, will I still have any true essence? However, I truly admire your strength. I admit, you indeed have the power to be a Repairer of the Main God, otherwise, you wouldn't have been able to dodge the vital points in my attack, which cost me my life essence.\"\n\nThe man in green said, \"Originally, I never intended to kill you from the start. You forced me into this. Since that's the case, don't blame me for being ruthless. You call yourself a Sacred Master, but can holiness truly save you? The light element is ineffective against your injuries. With the injuries you've sustained, even if they can be healed, you won't be able to recover your original strength.\"\n\nThe man in white smiled. Although his face, covered in blood, looked somewhat terrifying when he smiled, his aura remained as strong as at the beginning, even more so. \"What? Are you afraid? Are you afraid those Main Gods will retaliate against you?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I fear causing trouble,\" the man in green said, seeming to no longer care about his dignity at this point. \"Because I fear unnecessary trouble, I only want that item in your hand. On the Continent of Gods, nothing is more important than survival, not even for you and me who have reached godhood. To survive, what is a little fear? It seems your nickname, 'Stinky Rock,' is not wrong at all. Your stubborn temper will likely be taken to the grave.\"\n\n\"Yes! My temper is indeed stubborn. Once I decide on something, there's no changing my mind. I know you still have the ability to fight. Fight on, kill me, and perhaps you can find that item on me.\" The man in white's voice held no emotion, as if he were not talking about his own life.\n\n\"Are you truly not afraid of death?\" the man in green said hatefully. The wounds on his body were healing quickly, but the significant loss of blood and energy consumption couldn't be replenished in a short time.\n\n\"Death? What's the difference between death and life? On this Continent of Gods, what meaning does life hold? I haven't been here for a day or two, but what have I seen? What have you seen? I think you won't forget. On this continent, whether you call yourself the God of Wind or I am called the God of Light, we are all just people striving for survival. What gods? Aren't all so-called gods just people? If gods lived as miserably as we do, they would probably end themselves. For me, living in this joyless, dead world is worse than dying.\"\n\nThe man in green sighed, \"So you've long since come to terms with it. Unfortunately, I haven't, so I must have that item.\" Faint green light gradually condensed around his body, transforming into small wind blades, which gradually appeared in the air between the two.\n\nThe man in white also wanted to mobilize his battle qi, but unfortunately, his injuries were too severe, and he could no longer condense his battle qi into form. He could only emit a layer of milky white light around his body, looking defiantly at the man in green before him.\n\n\"Enough, she's about to fall. What's the point of fighting?\" a sharp voice rang out, causing the man in green, who was poised to attack, to change his expression drastically. On the Continent of Gods, all divine beings are extremely selfish, sometimes even resorting to devouring their own kind to sustain themselves for survival. Therefore, among divine beings, the most feared thing is to encounter another divine being when one is weakened, because no one hesitates, and even good friends can become a fatal threat. Although the environment on the Continent of Gods is extremely harsh, there are many special minerals on this continent. These minerals are made into life-saving items by divine beings in various ways, and they are very precious. The stronger the divine being, the more such artifacts they possess. Unfortunately, the protective gear and weapons on the man in green and the man in white were all consumed in the previous battle, otherwise, they wouldn't have reached the final stage of energy clash. To suddenly encounter an outsider, how could the man in green not be surprised?\n\nNadu and Jieshang walked out from the shadows. In reality, with their strength, they shouldn't have been able to conceal themselves from the two who were fighting desperately. It was only because the two had already expended a great deal of their strength by the time they reached this point, and coupled with the critical final battle, they had carelessly failed to sense their presence. After all, this was not far from the forbidden area, the Waterfall of Death, and very few divine beings usually came here, so neither of them paid much attention.\n\nThe joy on Nadu and Jieshang's faces was difficult to conceal. The intense joy made Nie Bing, who had just recovered from being struck by lightning, feel a wave of nausea.\n\nNadu and Jieshang walked towards the man in green and the man in white respectively. Faint red light emanated from both of them, with fire-attribute battle qi fluctuating around their bodies, as if they were about to attack at any moment.\n\nThe man in green said coldly, \"Who are you people? How dare you interfere in my affairs? Do you know who I am?\"\n\nNadu smiled slyly, \"Who you are? We don't know, and we don't want to know. Don't worry, we won't ask you for anything to redeem your lives. We'll just kill you directly, and then all the remaining items will be ours, won't they? With your strength, you should have quite a few good things on you. Moreover, eating your flesh might be quite beneficial. Heh heh.\"\n\nThe cold light in the man in green's eyes intensified. The wind blades he had prepared to deal with the man in white slowly retracted and hovered around him. \"Alright! I didn't expect to be double-crossed. Then come on, let's see who dies first.\"\n\nThe light in Nadu's eyes became even more greedy.\n\n\"If it were normal times, I would definitely not be your match. As a demigod, there's a huge gap between us gods and you. In your eyes, we're not even as good as ants. However, in your current state, what can you do? My strength may not be great, but with just a few of your wind blades, it seems unlikely you can deal with a demigod like me.\" As he spoke, he suddenly lunged forward, his entire body transforming into three figures with extreme speed. Three red lights shot out from the three figures. The red lights condensed into a single stream in the air and suddenly attacked the man in green. Nadu was very intelligent; he knew that using pure strength was the best method against a weakened opponent like the man in green, especially since the latter's battle qi was almost depleted, but his combat experience was still there. If they were to get into a protracted struggle, it would be troublesome if the opponent had any method to recover their strength. Therefore, he unleashed his full power from the outset. The battle qi cut through the air with a sharp whistling sound, and the scorching battle qi caused the air to burn, heading directly for the man in green's chest.\n\nThe man in white said nothing, nor did Jieshang, who was walking towards him. However, his movements were no slower than Nadu's. It was the same red battle qi, the same attack method, heading straight for the man in white.\n\nA flicker of unwillingness appeared in the man in white's eyes. He did not fear death, but how could he be willing to die at the hands of such opportunistic scoundrels? He would rather die at the hands of the man in green; at least the man in green had defeated him through skill. It was much better than dying so ignominiously. Unfortunately, his light battle qi could now only provide a slight protective effect; he could no longer contend with the opponent. Thus, he puffed out his chest. Even if he were to die, he would die like a man.\n\nBoom— The man in green's body was sent flying, spewing blood in mid-air. His wind blades had completely vanished. The seven wounds that had stopped bleeding before began to bleed again. He fell heavily to the ground, his chest blackened. His body twitched, and after spitting out another mouthful of blood, he barely managed to stabilize his breathing, but he was on his last legs. It was difficult to say whether he was still alive, let alone fight.",

    "content": "The same voice rang out in another direction, but with a hint of surprise. Nadu couldn't be bothered to check if the green-clothed person was truly dead. He quickly turned back to look in Jie Shang's direction. After all, for two demigods to kill two god-level experts, the psychological pressure was immense, and they feared any changes.\n\nAs soon as he turned back, Nadu felt a surge of boiling magical elements. Jie Shang, who had been attacking the white-clothed person, was standing in shock ten feet away, looking at the white-clothed person in disbelief. A blue water radiance gently descended, enveloping the white-clothed person in a water curtain. The small wounds healed rapidly under the nourishment of the blue light, and the deep gash also stopped bleeding with the appearance of this blue glow.\n\nWater element healing. Nadu and Jie Shang's expressions tightened simultaneously. Although Nadu hadn't seen what happened earlier, he could guess that Jie Shang had been repelled by the master who cast the water element. Both of them were already a bit timid. Nadu couldn't help but shout in a fierce yet weak voice, \"Who's there? Come out.\"\n\nA lazy voice echoed, \"The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. It seems I'm the eagle behind the oriole. You two, picking up benefits at such a timely moment!\" With a flash of silver light, a figure appeared out of thin air before the air cushion boat. It was Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing looked extremely disheveled. His clothes had been turned to ash by lightning, and even his long hair, which had turned gray after absorbing death energy, had vanished. His body was charred black, with wisps of smoke still curling around him. Before appearing, he had just taken out a coarse cloth garment from his spatial ring and put it on. His blackened face served as the best camouflage.\n\nSeeing this charred figure, Nadu's eyes flashed, and he said, \"You're that guy who got struck by lightning?\"\n\n\"Pfft,\" Nian Bing retorted, \"Do you think I wanted to be struck by lightning? Nadu and Jie Shang look rather strange. They have similar builds, tall and thin, like scarecrows, looking very peculiar. Nadu has a horse-like face, a hooked nose, a wide mouth, and a pair of small yellow eyes darting around. He looks extremely猥琐 (wěisuǒ - vulgar/obscene). Although Jie Shang is a bit better in appearance, he's not much better. His face isn't as long as Nadu's, but his skin is darker, which is somewhat similar to Nian Bing's current skin color.\"\n\n\"Mind your own business. If you know what's good for you, get lost immediately, or don't blame us brothers for being impolite,\" Nadu's sharp voice became even more grating.\n\nNian Bing shook his head. \"I wouldn't have interfered normally, but I know this person. You can't touch him.\" As he spoke, he pointed to the white-clothed person behind him, who was gradually recovering some strength in the water element.\n\nJie Shang heard what Nadu said, and naturally, Nadu heard it too. Their main targets were the white-clothed person. The green-clothed person wanting to snatch that item from the white-clothed person was what interested them most. Hearing Nian Bing say this, Nadu's attitude immediately became tougher. \"It seems you're going to oppose us, kid. You should know where this is. If we attract the magical beasts from the Death God's Waterfall, no one will be comfortable.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled. \"You're not going to tell me you're going to give me one last chance to choose, are you? If so, then you don't need to waste your breath. Come on, I was just looking to stretch my legs. You two, come at me together.\" He was very clear about his own strength. With his magic restored, he was even a little stronger than before, but he was at best evenly matched with either of the two demigods in front of him. However, he still felt confident. Strength isn't measured by just one aspect.\n\nNadu signaled to Jie Shang, then suddenly let out a sharp cry. His bamboo-stick-like body flashed like lightning towards Nian Bing. The red light in his hand condensed into a spear of battle qi, carrying countless red light spots and stabbing towards every vital point of Nian Bing. Jie Shang also moved at the same time, but his target was not Nian Bing, but the white-clothed person behind Nian Bing. They moved almost simultaneously, their coordination extremely默契 (mòqì - tacit understanding/well-coordinated).\n\nLooking at the red battle qi that made whistling sounds, Nian Bing stood still. A peculiar light flashed in his eyes, which had turned black. Hundreds of ice cones appeared before him without warning. Strangely, each ice cone met a point of attack from the fiery spear. These ice cones were definitely not ordinary second-tier magic; they were fully compressed ice cones. Individually, their power was not great, but compared to Nadu's dispersed battle qi, they did not fall behind.\n\nFor a moment, explosions of ice powder erupted in the air, scattering everywhere. As the ice cones met Nadu, a light ball also floated out from behind Nian Bing, meeting Jie Shang, who was reaching out to grab the white-clothed person. That was not an ordinary light ball, but five light balls mixed with red and blue colors. The light balls suddenly exploded in front of Jie Shang. At the moment of explosion, Jie Shang clearly felt the surrounding space seem to twist. A light pillar mixed with blue and red light abruptly blocked his chest. The light pillar was only half a foot in diameter, but the immense impact force made him greatly astonished. He quickly channeled all his battle qi to his palms and met the incoming attack.\n\nMagical elements filled the air again. Jie Shang was directly repelled to his previous position, and Nadu's attack had also stopped. The ice cones Nian Bing released had precisely canceled out his flashy spear attack. His attack was meant to attract Nian Bing's attention. When his battle qi was consumed by the ice cones, all the ice powder had just completely turned into ice dust, not a bit more or less.\n\nWho could match Nian Bing's control of energy? Although his magical power could only be compared to one of the two people in front of him, his precise judgment from the Heavenly Eye acupoint allowed his limited magical power to unleash its maximum potential.\n\n\"You're a magician?\" Nadu's sharp voice was filled with uncertain doubt.\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"What, is that not allowed?\"\n\nNadu's eyes flashed. He exchanged a glance with Jie Shang, and both of them suddenly smiled. It was known that magicians were very rare on the Divine Continent because the climate of the Divine Continent was too harsh, and their bodies simply couldn't withstand it. Therefore, most divine beings were practitioners of martial arts, with only a small portion being dual cultivators of magic and martial arts. From the ice and fire magic Nian Bing had used successively, as well as the spatial magic with compressed attack power, the two quickly confirmed Nian Bing's identity. They were not intimidated by Nian Bing's ability to cast three types of magic. Instead, they were greatly pleased, because they knew that no matter how skilled a magician was, they needed a period of time to chant incantations when casting major magic. Although Nian Bing in front of them gave them some pressure, he was not strong enough to defeat them working together. Therefore, once they knew he was a magician, their initial unease was finally relieved. The red fire-element battle qi continuously rose, and they both locked onto Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"It seems you look down on magicians! Perhaps you've never met a true magician?\"\n\nJie Shang disdainfully said, \"A true magician? I'd like to see what your so-called true magician is capable of.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"You will see. And it's right now.\" As he spoke, the gray line on his brow suddenly lit up. Seven-colored light emanated, transforming into threads of light that encircled his body.\n\nSeeing the change on Nian Bing's brow, Nadu and Jie Shang trembled all over and exclaimed in unison, \"Heavenly Eye Acupoint?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"What, you know about the Heavenly Eye Acupoint too? A magician and a magician with the Heavenly Eye Acupoint are completely different concepts. Moreover, my Heavenly Eye Acupoint should have entered the ultimate stage, although it's only the initial ultimate stage, I think it should be enough to deal with you.\"\n\nNadu and Jie Shang were both startled by the appearance of the Heavenly Eye Acupoint. As acupoints used by divine beings to measure their strength, all divine beings knew that the most important acupoints were the Heavenly Eye Acupoint and the Imperial Extreme Acupoint. However, opening the Heavenly Eye Acupoint was extremely difficult, especially when other acupoints had already been opened. The fact that the Heavenly Eye Acupoint could only be opened last caused most divine beings to give up on opening it. Therefore, they were suddenly startled when they saw that Nian Bing actually possessed the Heavenly Eye Acupoint. However, their surprise did not end there.\n\nThe seven-colored light around Nian Bing was transparent. Through the light formed by these threads, one could clearly see Nian Bing within. Suddenly, the seven-colored light turned silver. Before Nadu and Jie Shang could react in their astonishment, they suddenly realized that the surrounding space had completely distorted. The strong tearing sensation caused the fire-element battle qi around their bodies to fluctuate violently. The battle qi of the two immediately changed, from red to silver Saint battle qi, with wisps of golden light shining within the silver light. Obviously, they had reached the peak of the Martial Saint level.\n\nSaint battle qi, which was close to divine battle qi, could not be destroyed by spatial tearing. But it was not over yet. The light around Nian Bing's body suddenly changed, from silver to yellow. The earth trembled at this moment. From the solid black ground, black spikes emerged. Fortunately, the trembling of the ground alerted Nadu and Jie Shang, giving them time to ascend into the air and dodge most of the attacks. Those they couldn't dodge were dealt with by their battle qi amidst a roar. At this moment, a layer of cold sweat had broken out on them. If Nian Bing's initial blocking of their attacks was just ordinary magic, then the subsequent spatial and earth-element magic attacks were at least seventh-tier or above. Unforeseen seventh-tier magic attacks, what did that concept mean?\n\nTime did not give them much space to think. The light around Nian Bing's body changed again, and as before, there was no incantation that Nadu and the others expected. This time, the light turned red, and the sky also turned red.\n\nThe entire world seemed to be burning. The air distorted slightly due to the heat. Blue fireballs rained down from the sky, like meteors chasing the moon, carrying surging auras, heading towards Nadu and Jie Shang.\n\nWarrior's battle qi was indeed very strong. Warriors of the same level always had an advantage against magicians because they could attack quickly, and if the distance was far, they often had a chance to escape. However, in terms of true attack power, a warrior's battle qi was actually inferior to a magician's. Therefore, if a magician's magic was cast before a warrior's attack, it was usually the warrior who lost. The warrior's advantage lay in the magician's incantation. However, if the time for chanting incantations suddenly disappeared, and magic could be used as battle qi, this was something no warrior could endure.\n\nFire Meteor, an eighth-tier fire magic. This magic did not pose a real threat to two top-level Martial Saints. However, Nadu and Jie Shang, who had jumped into the air to dodge the Earth Rock Piercer, had no place to exert their strength, and they suddenly encountered the Fire Meteor in the air. At this moment, they only had one option: to face it head-on.\n\nAs the Fire Meteor collided with the silver Saint battle qi, bursting into brilliant fireworks, the light around Nian Bing's body had already changed again. He had even cut off his connection with the Fire Meteor, a gentle smile on his face. This time, what appeared were twin-colored ice spheres. This was only a sixth-tier ice magic, but if ten such twin-colored ice spheres appeared at once, they would not be easy to deal with. Moreover, with the alternating blue and green light flashing around Nian Bing's body, these twin-colored ice spheres combined with a whirlwind, rapidly sweeping upwards towards the two unlucky fellows, their power became even more terrifying. Who would want to face such an attack?\n\nThe fusion magic finally appeared before the two demigods, who had become exhausted after dealing with the Fire Meteor. The timing was extremely precise. Just as they had dealt with half of the fire and were about to descend to the ground, the whirlwind ice spheres had intimately arrived below them, their enveloping power just enclosing the two of them.\n\nNian Bing smiled and shook his head. The light around his body changed again. This time, it turned black, representing death. A colossal figure slowly emerged behind his body. It was a dark figure, thirty feet tall, and a deathly aura silently spread around. At this moment, the surroundings were filled with a deathly aura. In the hands of this massive shadow, there was a blade, a scythe, the scythe representing the God of Death.\n\nFierce roars accompanied the light of magical elements scattering everywhere. To save their lives, Nadu and Jie Shang's bodies were already emitting various lights. Talismans, armor, and their weapons appeared one after another. However, in an incomplete state, facing the tenth-tier whirlwind ice spheres, all they could feel was pain.",

    "content": "The fusion of ice and wind sent the two half-god experts flying, their bodies drifting in the air with unwilling and pained roars. Their desperate cries were filled with fury and resentment, and specks of blood scattered in the air. Although the fusion magic hadn't killed them, the sharp essence of ice and wind had deeply imprinted within their bodies, reducing their combat power by more than half. Coupled with their physical injuries, each was left with less than 30% of their original strength.\n\nAt this moment, both Na Du and Jie Shang had the same thought: escape. Yes, they had lost the confidence to fight, and all they could do was run. However, just as they were about to unleash their last reserves of strength, even at the cost of their vital energy to escape this terrifying magical prison, the aura of death had quietly enveloped them.\n\nThe last sight Na Du and Jie Shang saw in their lives was Nian Bing's smile, but in their eyes, it was the smile of the Grim Reaper. The gray scythe was transparent, cutting through the air with an illusory black gleam. Everything was so simple. With a perfect swing, the gray figure had silently vanished. At the same time, everything was over.\n\nNa Du and Jie Shang, still in their intended escape postures in the air, were now frozen. Their bodies floated silently in the air, as if they had always been there.\n\nThe light on Nian Bing's forehead receded, and the magical aura around his body vanished. Without even a second glance at the two half-gods in the air, Nian Bing turned and walked towards the white-clothed man behind him. If they could escape an eleventh-tier forbidden dark curse, the Kiss of Death, after being weakened by 70%, then Na Du and Jie Shang would surely be more than just half-gods. Unfortunately, they were just half-gods after all.\n\nAs Nian Bing turned, the two bamboo poles in the air had already turned to bamboo dust, disappearing silently without leaving a trace. In this world, not a trace of their presence remained.\n\nNian Bing's expression was calm. He approached the white-clothed man and the first thing he did was take off his own clothes. Then, water elements naturally condensed around his body, forming streams of water that continuously washed over him.\n\nThe white-clothed man had recovered some of his strength under the treatment of the water elements and his own self-healing light battle qi. He watched in surprise as the dark-skinned person in front of him gradually became clean, his surprise turning into shock. \"You… how can it be you?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"You still remember me? Senior Saint Master.\" As he spoke, he bowed towards the Saint Master. Yes, this white-clothed man with a resolute face and unyielding character was the one who had fully unlocked the ability of the 'Dawn – Saint Radiance Blade' that pierced through heaven and earth, and guided Nian Bing to obtain the Demon Devouring Blade. Although Nian Bing had never seen his face, his voice and sacred aura were deeply imprinted in his mind. Therefore, when Nian Bing's spiritual power detected him, he had already recognized his identity.\n\nThe Saint Master looked Nian Bing up and down and couldn't help but frown slightly. As a wielder of light, he could clearly sense the deathly aura emanating from Nian Bing. Although Nian Bing had hidden it very deeply, he himself was the source of death. \"Nian Bing, weren't you on the Yangguang Continent? How did you end up here, and looking like this?\"\n\nNian Bing sighed softly and said, \"It's a long story. Senior Saint Master, how are you feeling? Are you any better?\"\n\nThe Saint Master shook his head with a wry smile and said, \"Thank you for saving me, but my injuries are too severe. To gain even a slight chance of victory, I risked my vital energy to use that attack, which has backfired on me. I'm afraid it will take decades of hard cultivation to recover. This is all thanks to your water magic healing, otherwise, even without those two, I might not have survived. I just don't understand, you are clearly filled with deathly aura, but why is the magic you cast so pure? I remember you cultivating all elemental magic. Judging by your appearance now, you must have reached great mastery. But even with great mastery, as a mage, how could you not chant incantations?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"This is not a secret. When one's spiritual power reaches the point where it can resonate with the magical elements in the air and become true friends with them, then these magical elements no longer need specific sounds to command them. You only need to use your own magical power as a catalyst, coupled with spiritual control, to naturally produce magical power. In fact, every mage understands this principle, but to be able to fully resonate with magical elements and produce the required power is not that simple. I was just a bit luckier to achieve it.\"\n\nLuck? If luck were enough to bring one back from the dead, not many people would choose it. Nian Bing's current achievements could only be described as a miracle. When he left Green Mountain, his magical power hadn't changed, but his spiritual power had entered the realm of great mastery. He had a peculiar sensation in his mind; he knew clearly that he had entered the ultimate state of the Celestial Eye Acupoint. Although this state was not complete, the first effect it produced was that magic no longer required incantations, regardless of its stage. Eleventh-tier forbidden spells were the strongest magic Nian Bing could currently cast. Even such magic did not require chanting, and he was confident that even if he faced a priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess, he would have a great chance of winning.\n\nHis magical power did not decrease while casting spells, but the time for chanting incantations had disappeared. With his special physique and the innate qi filled with deathly aura, Nian Bing also had a recovery rate far beyond ordinary mages.\n\nThe Saint Master's wounds were gradually healing under Nian Bing's continuous application of water elements, but the internal injuries were not so easily mended. He cultivated light battle qi, which gave him a much stronger recovery ability than ordinary martial artists. However, once severely injured, the effect of healing magic on him was extremely limited; most of it had to rely on his own recovery capabilities.\n\n\"Why did you end up fighting that Wind God? It seemed like he was trying to steal your things,\" Nian Bing asked.\n\nThe Saint Master nodded and sighed deeply. \"If I had known what the Divine Continent was like back then, I would never have chosen to come here. But now, it's too late to say anything.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Yes! This is hardly a world of gods. It's clearly a hellish continent.\"\n\nThe Saint Master shook his head. \"No. It's not because of the environment here. In fact, I quite like the environment here. Under the pressure of the environment, everyone is forced to cultivate diligently to survive. However, I'm tired of the relationships between gods and mortals. Here, gods and mortals only engage in deceit. Forget about family affection or friendship; there are only relationships of mutual exploitation and self-interest. This is the root of my disgust. On the surface, all gods and mortals are under the rule of the main gods. The current seven main gods have all awakened from their cultivation, but they have never effectively controlled the gods and mortals. To survive, everyone here is extremely selfish. Perhaps, only when the threat of the Lost Empire loomed over them back then did they unite. They simply don't understand that only by uniting completely can they survive better. Fortunately, the seal here restricts the gods and mortals from setting foot on the Yangguang Continent, otherwise, everything would become chaotic. You must have heard that here, people can eat people for food. This is unimaginable on the Yangguang Continent.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Have you considered leaving here? Returning to the Yangguang Continent?\"\n\nThe Saint Master shook his head. \"Let alone that I cannot leave, even if I could, I wouldn't. Those few main gods treat me quite well. With me here, I can balance some of the relationships between gods and mortals. I absolutely do not wish to see the thing I fear most happen.\"\n\nNian Bing understood that what the Saint Master feared most was the gods and mortals going to the Yangguang Continent. If that happened, the Yangguang Continent would face a great catastrophe. \"How many gods and mortals are there on the Divine Continent?\"\n\nThe Saint Master said, \"There are about ten thousand people. I don't know the exact number. The two you just killed are considered to be of above-average ability among the gods and mortals. If they had cultivated for another hundred years, they might have reached the god level. Besides the seven main gods, there are also sixty to seventy god-level gods and mortals. Among the powerful ones, some are appointed by the main gods as their successors, like the Wind God who fought me earlier. He is several hundred years older than me and is a genius who cultivates wind elemental battle qi. If the gods and mortals could unite, their strength would be terrifying. Think about it, over ten thousand experts above the Martial Fighter level, including nearly a thousand half-gods equivalent to Martial Saints, dozens of god-level experts stronger than God Masters, and the seven supreme main gods above them. It would be very easy to sweep through the Yangguang Continent. Oh, right, you came from the Yangguang Continent, was the Vial of Mo Odas really stolen?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded silently and said, \"Yes, it was stolen by a lich and his subordinates. They weren't originally a match for the Dragon Kings, but they took advantage of the Dragon Kings' breeding period to strike suddenly, which allowed them to succeed.\"\n\nThe Saint Master smiled slightly and said, \"That's a good thing!\"\n\nNian Bing was startled. \"A good thing? Aren't you afraid of the war that might occur if the Lost Continent returns?\"\n\nThe Saint Master said indifferently, \"That would be the scenario I most hope to see. After ten thousand years of recuperation, although the number of gods and mortals has not increased, their vitality has largely recovered. If this continues, eventually the gods and mortals will be unable to tolerate life here and will set foot on the Yangguang Continent, and that will be the disaster of all humanity. A group of selfish gods and mortals will destroy the entire human world. For the sake of more humans living peacefully, and to maintain the peace of the Yangguang Continent, I actually hope the Lost Continent returns. The struggles between the strong will inevitably force the Divine Continent to lie low again. Even if the Divine Continent wins, they won't be able to act for some time. As for the Lost Continent, its area is not much smaller than the Yangguang Continent, so there is no need for it to affect the Yangguang Continent. Even if there is an impact, with the human population of the Lost Continent, it will only lead to human change, not human destruction. Nian Bing, you have an unparalleled advantage. I hope you can make efforts for the future of humanity.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly. \"Perhaps. However, I only wish to live peacefully with my family. Coming to the Divine Continent was out of desperation. Here, I am only trying to restore my vitality. There are some things you don't know. On this Divine Continent, even the main gods cannot make decisions, and it's not easy to leave. Who knows what the future will bring? We'll take it one step at a time. I am also a selfish person, but if someone tries to disrupt my living environment, I will not stand idly by. That Wind God doesn't seem to be dead. Would you like me to help you get rid of him?\"\n\nThe Saint Master's gaze swept towards the Wind God in the distance. The Wind God was slowly getting up from the ground, his chest clothes soaked in blood. Originally, he had been lying on the ground pretending to be dead. Upon hearing Nian Bing's words, he had no choice but to get up. His breathing was a little rapid. His battle with the Saint Master had consumed most of his combat power, and he had also taken a full-force blow from Na Du. Although he had suppressed his serious injuries with his own cultivation, he had lost most of his combat power. From Nian Bing's process of killing Na Du and the other, he knew very well that even at his peak, it would not be easy to defeat this mysterious person. Nian Bing's ability to cast powerful magic without chanting had left a deep impression on him. At this moment, his eyes were filled with terror. As a selfish god and mortal, he knew his fate very well.\n\nThe Saint Master shook his head. \"Forget it. If I were to show no mercy, what difference would I have from those guys? Wind God, you may leave. Not everyone is like you.\"\n\nThe Wind God was stunned for a moment. He looked at the Saint Master, then at Nian Bing, his eyes showing a complex light. However, he did not leave. Instead, he walked towards the Saint Master step by step. Seeing his staggering appearance, Nian Bing couldn't help but frown. \"What? The Saint Master is willing to spare you, and you still don't leave?\" If the Wind God were his enemy, he would have long since taken action to destroy him. The Wind God had lost all his arrogance. \"Leave? Leave for where? Even if you don't kill me, if I leave here now, I could be killed by any stray magical beast.\"",

    "content": "The sage said with some hilariousness: \"Aren't you afraid that I will change my mind now?\"\n\n\n\nFeng Shen smiled bitterly and said, \"Anyway, it's all death. It's much better for me to die in your hands than to be eaten by a demon.\" As he said, he had already come to Nian Bing and the others, sat on the ground and stopped whispering, and ignored whether Nian Bing and the Holy Master would hurt him. He just practiced on his own. He said everything he said was the truth. On the great land of God, if he had no strength to protect himself, he would have to die.\n\n\n\nThe sage laughed and said, \"Okay, Feng Shen, you are more straightforward than those despicable guys. Okay, then let's cultivate and recover together.\" Of course, he has a preceptive heart against Feng Shen. Although his strength is not a match for Feng Shen, Feng Shen is not as good as him in terms of physical recovery. He was not in a hurry, and turned to Nian Bing and said, \"Don't you want to know that he just chased and killed what I wanted?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing slammed his head and said, \"That's your secret, it has nothing to do with me. I just want to know that with your thousands of years, your strength does not seem to be much higher than in Yangon's Grand Sound. Why is that? “He has seen a lot since the battle between the Holy Master and the Wind God. Although the Holy Master and the Wind God are powerful, they are not as powerful as he imagined.\n\n\n\nThe saint looked at Nian Bing with satisfaction and said, \"Since you have received the recognition of the saint sword, I already know that in some aspects you still have many similarities with me. However, on the great land of God, most people have lived for more than a thousand years, and even have old monsters that have lived to thousands of years. However, the strongest human beings are just opening six acupoints and able to hold the main gods with fourteenth level power. Only at least four or more main gods can be able to perform ten. Level 5 attack or defense. In fact, this question is not difficult to answer. The human body has no potential. It is also a huge warehouse. As long as you keep digging the things in the warehouse, you can become stronger. However, the human body is actually limited. Even if you keep digging, it will be much more difficult to improve after the potential has reached a certain level. Simply put, the best practice for humans from birth to fifty years is the best During the golden period, there are often many practitioners who practice as long as they have a certain talent and are willing to work hard, and they can only practice the eleventh level in fifty years. That is, the martial arts or demonic guides mentioned in Yangon Mainland. However, from the eleventh level, it is a water stadium, and it starts here. More than 90% of practitioners can only maintain the level of the eleventh level, and can break through the twelve level, which can be said to be rare. If a person does not have one, he will never have one at the age of 100. If he reaches the twelve level, he will never make a breakthrough again. He can only lose his life by being washed by the age of a month like an ordinary person. However, once he breaks through the twelve level, he will enter the innate cultivation from the acquired cultivation level. His life will be eliminated because his body is washed by the innate atmosphere again. At this time, age is no longer a restriction. As long as the innate atmosphere is still there, he can live forever until the body cannot bear it.Human bodies are no less than dragons called the strongest creatures in many places. As long as we have innate atmosphere, we can live no shorter than dragons. But after the eleventh level, it will be difficult to improve further. It requires constant cultivation and high understanding, and some innate and earthly elements along the way to make more breakthroughs. And such a breakthrough would be difficult to happen without miracles. If you are angry, if you want to improve your strength, it will become abnormally difficult after you pass the eleventh level. The more you improve, the higher the difficulty. Among the gods and men, I am still very lucky. I have reached the thirteenth level. Although I am still far away from the thirteenth level, I have no chance. The wind is a little stronger than me. He has touched the fourteenth level edge, and is proud that he can become the successor of the Lord God. In fact, an ordinary demigod has not been achieved in the twelve levels, otherwise, you would not have killed two of them so easily. \"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"What about the true god? How many levels are the true gods? I heard that when they first lost the land and were taken away by them, they used the level forbidden spell, which was a level of time and space transfer at a level of seventeen. \"\n\n\n\nThe sage looked at Nian Bing with some surprise, \"It turns out that you also know the existence of the True God. It seems that there are quite a lot of things you know. Gods and men have also secretly calculated the power of the True God. From the perspective of their physical power, the four true gods should all be around the sixteenth level. Although they are only two levels higher than the Lord God, I can almost calm down, even if all the Lord Gods are added together. It is not one. The opponent of a true god. The higher the level, the greater the difference in the first level of strength. As for the seventeenth level forbidden spells that they can fight with each other, that is almost a power to destroy the heavens and the earth. I even thought that if there were eighteenth level forbidden spells, then the world where we were will be completely destroyed. Fortunately, that ability that defies the heavens has never appeared.\"\n\n\n\nThe sixteenth level true god, now he counts, should be between the eleventh level and the twelveth level. I wonder if the Tianyan acupoint can compete with the twelve level ice and snow goddess priests? Thinking of this, he continued to ask, \"Saint Master, with my current strength, if she faces a magician who can use the twelve levels of forbidden spells, and at the same time, she has opened up the three sacs including the Emperor's Neck acupoint, how many opportunities can she have to win?\"\n\n\n\nThe sage was stunned for a moment, and after thinking about it, he said with a head: \"This is very difficult. I can see that your mental power has reached a very high level, and even if you and Feng Shen may not be able to compete with you. Facing a magician, even if your overall strength is not good, it would be impossible to interfere with her magic with your current mental power. If you cooperate with other conditions, you may not be able to win. It is impossible. However, you have to be careful of the Huangpi acupoint. Although the strongest skull is not the most powerful, its key point is that it can condense all the energy of the human body into a little attack in an instant. Therefore, if the opponent's strength is higher than you and you can't defeat her at once, I will still run away. Yangon Mainland, I really miss that time!Maybe I will be able to go back soon. Do you know what the wind god is going to snatch from me? In fact, it is a token of the Lord Gods. There was a problem with the bottle of Merodas Seal, and the main gods were very concerned, so they decided to send some masters to Yangon Mainland to investigate the matter and fight back the bottle of Merodas Seal. But it is not easy to leave this God's Great Land, so after the Lord God made sure that the person was chosen, he gave everyone who was about to send to Yangon a token, and used this token to concentrate in a valley southwest of the God's Great Land, and then the Lord God worked together to open the seal and send us out. Because I come from Yangon Mainland, I have the power of the thirteenth level. So he became one of the messengers of the Great Land of God this time. And Feng Shen also wanted to go to Yangon Mainland, so he came to take my token. \"\n\n\n\nNian Bing glanced at Feng Shen. He suddenly said, \"So that's it. Maybe, we will meet in Yangon soon. How many gods and people will pass by this time in the Great Land of God?\"\n\n\n\nThe sage master said, \"There will not be many. If too many gods appear, it will inevitably cause trouble. Therefore, there will not be more than ten gods and people going to Yangon this time, but they are all demigod top or god-level powers. It will deal with the dark power of a lich leader. With us, these people are enough. The key is to be able to find them in time. Alas, I am very conflicted now. I didn’t want to take this task, but when I thought of going back to Yangon Mainland, my sing in my heart prompted me to take it. I don’t know what Yangon Mainland is like now after many years?”\n\n\n\nNian Bing said with a eyebrows: \"I think this is not a good thing when the gods and men arrive in Yangon Mainland. If the gods and men are selfish, then it is difficult to guarantee that they will not do anything.\"\n\n\n\nThe sage master said, \"It has been decided, and it is impossible to stop it. I just hope that when I arrive in Yangon, I can contact King Seven Dragons as soon as possible and work with them to ensure that this matter is successfully completed.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing glanced at the wind in the cultivation hall and said, \"Prince, please take a rest, let me take a break, I will protect you.\"\n\n\n\nThe sage smiled slightly, slammed his head, and said, \"It should be that you have something to do, so you don't have to stay here. In fact, because it is very close to the Death Waterfall, there will be no gods coming here in normal times.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's eyes flashed with a cold light and she winked at the sage. The sage shook him and smiled and said, \"Don't worry, although this wind god is more domineering, it is not wrong among gods. He will not attack me again. Go, if there is any evil, we will definitely meet again.\" The sage sits on his knees and closes his eyes. As his body recovers a little, a layer of milky white light comes out from his body, covering his body with Fengshen. Although the defense of this boundary is not strong, it has a certain imitation and blends with the surrounding environment.A group of yellow light lit up around Nian Bing's body. The yellow light became stronger and stronger. The ground around him shook slightly. The light in his black eyes flashed. The hard black rocks on the south moved. The huge rocks raised up to cover the Master and Feng Shen Ba. On these black rocks, he engraved four magic weapons and stopped. Because his mental power increased, his magic weapons were now more relaxed. With these defenses, Nian Bing believed that as long as he did not encounter a too powerful demon, the saints and the two would not be injured. At that time, he would no longer stay, and the green light surrounded his body and rose up. The urging element guards itself towards Red Mountain. As long as you pass Red Mountain, you will see the wind.\n\n\n\nIn the first round, Red Mountain was already far away. Nianbing controlled the clear wind around and stopped in the air. He clearly remembered the description of the rosy in the first place. He didn't want to be a target of separation, falling, distinguishing the surrounding environment, and seeing the way forward. There was a silence around, with only the various magical elements in the air waving. Although the sky was still full of clouds, Nian Bing's air was still good and there was no magical storm again. The tall red mountain re-entered the clouds, and Nian Bing's eyebrows lit up. A faint colorful light cover covered a foot of his body. There was no need to do anything deliberately. The magic power was ready to deal with possible changes at any time under the control of mental power. When he was first cut off, he still remembered clearly.\n\n\n\nAt this moment, a roar suddenly came out in the air. No, the sound was not transmitted from the air, but from the mountain. The abnormal abrupt sound appeared. The fire element drama on the Red Mountain was shaking violently, and the red clouds formed by the folds were clearly and clearly rushed in one direction. A group of black light suddenly lit up halfway up the mountain, and the surging energy rushed out and actually fought with the folds from below. \n\n\n\n\"Not good.\" Nian Bing exclaimed softly and rushed to the mountain without any hesitation. He was so familiar with the roaring sound, and coupled with the black fighting atmosphere, it was clearly a roar!\n\n\n\n  After everything, Immortal Bing quickly headed towards the place where the sound came out. At the same time, the light of the body turned into blue, and a huge double-colored ice ball rushed towards the folding group with a sharp tip. The protective light instantly turned blue, and the ice and earth seal ball and the dragon rolling style perfectly merged together. A gap appeared behind hundreds of folds, which also attracted the folds' attention.\n\n\n\nStill in the air, Nian Bing had seen the sturdy look and changed his horns. His short god's horn was filled with dirt, and his head and beard were much longer than when he broke up last time. The big axe in his hand was twice as big as when he saw it last time. It was not that the axe had expanded, but that the black axe was filled with a realistic fighting light. Nian Bing clearly remembered that the rogue once said that the rogue was a very revengeful race, so he did not kill a rogue last time, but now it is different. The rogue is crazy and constantly slashing out one axe after another, with at least thirty pieces surrounding his body.The flashes formed by purple sky fires kept striking towards him, and were all resolved by his big axe left and right. At this time, the fierce attack was extremely strong, and every axe was slashed as if it was about to open the red mountain. Although the sky fire was strong, the shape of the other people had been beaten by the horns. The black war axe turned into a large black group around his body, making the purple sky fire unable to invade.\n\n\n\nThe attack of the ice ball under the cooperation of Long Wind was very powerful. Unfortunately, the one below was a difference. When Nian Bing's attack just appeared, the pressure on the horn's body was also weakened a lot, but the difference reaction behind the reaction was quick, and it immediately dropped. Fire light burst out from the sharp corners, and purple light flashed out alternately. The ice ball in the air turned into a piece of ice powder.",

    "content": "Nian Bing naturally didn't expect the Frozen Sphere to cause any damage to the Zhebie, as long as it could temporarily block their attacks. Heavenly Fire was the supreme among fires, but the power of a single Heavenly Fire attack from the Zhebie was limited. In an instant, Nian Bing had completed his next spell. Blue light rose from behind him, condensing into a blue phantom. Snowflakes, like sharp blades, spun and fell. Just like the Meteor Shower spell he used before, an eighth-tier ice-elemental area-of-effect spell, Ice Hell, was instantly formed. Ferocious ice elements drifted down, coming into contact with the purple Heavenly Fire, immediately releasing a thick layer of water vapor. Eighth-tier spells couldn't block Heavenly Fire. Nian Bing's goal was simple; he just hoped that under the effect of his spell, it would create confusion for the Zhebie.\n\nHowever, this time Nian Bing miscalculated. The reason Zhebie were called Zhebie was that their attack accuracy was incomparable to any magical beast. This was because they possessed much stronger mental power than ordinary magical beasts, allowing them to easily lock onto the positions of already detected targets. Thus, as the water mist dispersed, more than a dozen purple Heavenly Fires shot out, aiming straight for Nian Bing.\n\nFacing the attack, Nian Bing was startled but not panicked. The light around his body instantly turned silver. With a low growl, he cast \"Spatial Mirror.\" Immediately, four silver mirrors appeared around his body. Each Heavenly Fire, upon attacking a silver mirror, would gain a layer of silver halo and be reflected in another direction. This seventh-tier spatial magic originally required a lengthy incantation and was not very practical, so Nian Bing had never used it before. But now it was different; he could cast spells without chanting. It was perfectly suited to block the lightning-fast Heavenly Fires of the Zhebie.\n\nWhen the water mist dissipated, Nian Bing had already changed his position. After blocking the Zhebie's attacks several times, he arrived above Xialu. Although powerful, Nian Bing judged that Xialu's strength was at most at the thirteenth-tier. Facing so many Zhebie, self-preservation was already very difficult. If it weren't for the battle axe in his hand with extremely strong attack power and the Dwarf God Armor he wore, Xialu's defenses would likely have been breached long ago.\n\nA black figure split from Nian Bing's body. With a flash of shadow, it arrived beside Xialu. The black blade light, carrying the purest aura of death, instantly sliced through the bodies of two Zhebie. The sudden appearance of the surging aura of death caused the attacking Zhebie to hesitate for a moment. It was at this time that five colossal black shadows appeared above the Zhebie without any warning. Although the Zhebie's bodies were not small, they were nothing compared to these five colossal figures. The five black shadows descended like five mountains, and with a deafening roar, they instantly surrounded the black figure and Xialu. The Zhebie that were in their original positions and couldn't escape in time were crushed into meat patties by the colossal black figures.\n\nThe Black Demonic Rat's body was one-third larger than before. When they were at the Waterfall of Death, not only did Black Wu Huang recover its darkness abilities, but it also benefited and evolved to the seventh-tier, the same as the Flying God Pig. The other four black magical beasts were the Flying God Pig, the Nine-Fungus Poison Spider, the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon, and the Black Tiger King. This Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon was even larger than the one Nian Bing had killed previously. Although the Nine-Fungus Poison Spider's body was smaller than the Flying God Pig's, if its nine long legs were included, the area it covered was even larger than the Flying God Pig's. The ends of its nine long legs resembled nine giant scythes, flashing with a dark blue light. As one of the four great magical beasts guarding the Waterfall of Death, and also one of the four great magical beasts of the Divine Continent, its attack power was no less than that of the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon. The Black Tiger King was the smallest among these five magical beasts, but its length still exceeded fifteen feet. Its gray body was covered with black patterns. It let out a roar towards the sky, immediately scaring away several nearby Zhebie. The sudden appearance of the five colossal magical beasts completely changed the situation. The Flying God Pig, the Nine-Fungus Poison Spider, the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon, and the Black Tiger King, as the four great dark magical beasts guarding the Waterfall of Death, their combined strength was no less than that of the Zhebie. Especially the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon, its formidable defensive power was so great that even Heavenly Fire could not harm it. It spread its enormous body, blocking a large number of Heavenly Fire attacks.\n\nThe higher the tier of magical beasts, the greater their intelligence. The suddenly appearing powerful magical beasts immediately made the fiercely attacking Zhebie retreat. They clustered together, continuously attacking with Heavenly Fire. Black Wu Huang let out a long cry, floated onto the Flying God Pig's head, pointed forward with his Demonic Devouring Blade, and the five magical beasts immediately launched an attack on the Zhebie. Dark energy and Heavenly Fire continuously collided in the air. The Zhebie retreated while using Heavenly Fire to block these powerful magical beasts. If these magical beasts were only one, the Zhebie could have surrounded and killed them. But with five appearing at once, and with Black Wu Huang leading them, the Zhebie were immediately at a disadvantage. Amidst the bombardment of surging energy, more than a dozen Zhebie were successively destroyed by dark energy.\n\nSuddenly losing its target, Xialu swung his axe at the hard rocks of Red Mountain, producing a loud bang. He was already at the end of his strength, his body trembled slightly, and he gasped for air.\n\nAs soon as Nian Bing landed beside Xialu, he clearly felt a sense of despair emanating from him. He was startled and quickly asked, \"Xialu, how are you? Are you injured?\"\n\nXialu looked up somewhat blankly. When he saw Nian Bing, his eyes instantly turned red. He forcefully pulled up the black battle axe from the ground and said, \"It's you, I'll kill you.\" He raised the battle axe towards Nian Bing in a frenzy and swung it down fiercely. Nian Bing was startled. His body flashed, and using the ultimate magic of instant movement, he moved to the side, dodging Xialu's attack. He said urgently, \"Xialu, what's wrong? It's me, I'm Nian Bing!\"\n\nXialu stood there blankly. Suddenly, he loosened his grip, and the battle qi on the black battle axe disappeared, falling to the ground with a crisp sound. \"They're all dead, all dead.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned. Without caring about Xialu attacking him, he floated to Xialu's side. Milky white light lit up, and the light-elemental Awakening Spell enveloped Xialu's body. \"What happened? Who died?\" An ominous premonition arose in his heart, and his expression couldn't help but become solemn.\n\nUnder the effect of the Awakening Spell, the confusion in Xialu's eyes gradually disappeared. He looked up at Nian Bing, his eyes filled with complex light. \"Dead. They're all dead, they're all dead! It's all your fault, all because of you.\" Just awakened, he instantly entered a state of frenzy again. He sucked his right hand, and the black battle axe returned to his hand, swinging towards Nian Bing once more.\n\n\"Xialu, be clear-headed.\" This time, Nian Bing didn't dodge. The divine light in his eyes flared. His spiritual power pierced into Xialu's mind like a sharp needle, letting out a shout from within.\n\nThe black battle axe stopped three inches from Nian Bing's forehead. Nian Bing's protective colorful light flickered under the influence of the black battle qi. Nian Bing's gaze became exceptionally peaceful again. He looked at Xialu and said softly, \"Xialu, my good brother, be clear-headed and tell me, what happened?\"\n\nXialu looked at Nian Bing with complex eyes. Suddenly, he roared and turned around abruptly, running down Red Mountain. Nian Bing dared not delay. This time, he didn't use magic but relied on his strong physique to leap up and pursue Xialu. As Nian Bing retreated, Black Wu Huang immediately recalled the five magical beasts with his Demonic Devouring Blade and launched the final wave of attack on the Zhebie, following Nian Bing.\n\nXialu's speed was a few points faster than before. He ran forward desperately, not even looking at the path. When he encountered an obstructing rock, he immediately chopped it with his axe, shattering it. It didn't take long before the black Holy Mountain was in sight. Xialu's body leaped like a shooting star towards the peak. Nian Bing followed closely behind, ten feet behind him, but did not overtake him. When the two arrived at the summit of the Holy Mountain, Xialu finally stopped. With a thud, he knelt on the summit and cried out loud.\n\nNian Bing stood quietly beside Xialu, asking no more questions. Although he didn't know what had happened, Xialu's current state was that of someone who had suffered a great shock. Letting him vent was necessary to prevent it from affecting his body. Xialu's crying caused the surrounding ground to tremble. In extreme pain, his hands dug into the ground, and the black battle qi around his body fluctuated unstably.\n\nA full half hour passed before Xialu's crying gradually subsided. Nian Bing walked behind him and once again cast the light-elemental Awakening Spell, soothing the pain in Xialu's heart.\n\n\"Xialu, what exactly happened? What's wrong with you?\" Nian Bing asked softly. Although he didn't want to stimulate Xialu further, he was anxious to know what had happened.\n\nXialu slowly stood up, picked up his large axe, turned back, and gave Nian Bing a cold look. \"Follow me.\" He then kicked away the rock blocking the dwarf cave and jumped in. Nian Bing vaguely felt something and quickly followed Xialu into the dwarf cave. It seemed nothing had happened here; everything was still the same as before. However, the atmosphere in the cave was filled with a sense of deathly stillness, which made Nian Bing feel uneasy.\n\nFinally, he followed Xialu to the depths of the cave where the dwarves lived. Xialu went directly into Rada's room. The room was empty, but the entire room was filled with magical aura. Nian Bing felt a familiar and intimate sense calling to him. As soon as he entered the room, he saw the six gleaming treasure knives of various colors on the stone table. They were his six divine knives. All six divine knives had changed. Compared to before, the divine knives now emitted a more active glow. The treasure light that would scatter and rise unrestrainedly before was now completely contained. Nian Bing clearly felt that the six divine knives seemed to have come alive. Although they lay quietly on the stone table, they were full of vitality.\n\n\"Xialu, where is Aunt Rada? Where are Uncle Xiarong and the others?\" Nian Bing asked subconsciously, looking at Xialu, who stood silently by the table.\n\nXialu looked up and gave Nian Bing a cold look. \"They're dead, all dead. In this Holy Mountain, besides you, I am the only one still alive.\"\n\n\"What?\" Nian Bing exclaimed in shock. Although he had vaguely guessed it, hearing it from Xialu's mouth brought him immense shock. He hadn't interacted with the dwarves for long, but Rada's kind expression, and the dwarves' warmth and tolerance had left a deep impression on Nian Bing. He didn't have many friends, and after arriving at the Holy Mountain, he had truly considered the dwarves his friends. \"How could this happen? How did Aunt Rada and the others die? Could it be the divine beings?\" Nian Bing's heart clenched, and strong emotions welled up in his eyes. Tears streamed down his cheeks, and a sense of sorrow filled the entire room.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing's sorrowful look, Xialu's expression improved slightly. But upon hearing Nian Bing's question, he immediately became agitated again. \"Divine beings? It's not divine beings at all. It's you, you caused them to die. If it weren't for you, how could my mother have died, and how could my uncles have died?\" His fists made cracking sounds as his bones were squeezed too tightly.\n\nNian Bing's body swayed, and his mind buzzed. The intelligent Nian Bing immediately thought of the crux of the problem. \"Could it be that Aunt Rada and the others died because they were helping me forge knives...\"\n\nXialu snorted coldly, took out a stone tablet from his armor, and threw it to Nian Bing. \"My mother asked me to give this to you. Three days ago, after they completed forging the knives, they left this world.\"\n\nNian Bing took the stone tablet into his hand. It was covered with delicate small characters. \"Nian Bing, I believe you will return. After Xialu returned from the Waterfall of Death, when I didn't see you return for a long time, I thought you were dead. But I believe you are still alive. Because, from the six knives you left behind, I can feel your aura. Otherwise, these six knives would have reverted to being ownerless. Don't be sad, don't be sad. This is our best ending. As a master blacksmith of the dwarf race, it is happiness for us to die because we forged divine artifacts. While writing this, I can assert that we will definitely succeed. Our years of research were not in vain. Perhaps you are very strange why, after knowing us for a short time, we would help you forge divine knives at the cost of our lives. Actually, the reason is very simple: you brought us hope, allowing us to truly taste the delicious food of our homeland. Your unreserved actions, without any ulterior motives, have earned our recognition, recognition as a friend of the dwarf race. Before proceeding with the forging, Xiarong and I discussed it, and we considered many things. In the end, we decided to do this. You don't need to blame yourself. Although part of the reason we helped you was to repay your kindness, the more important reason is for Xialu. Xialu is extremely filial. If we were still alive, he would never leave with you. Do you remember my request? Take Xialu to the Yangguang Continent. I hope my only child can see the land of the Yangguang Continent and experience life there. Only when we are all dead can he leave without any worries. Aunt has only one request: please take good care of Xialu and help him become a dwarf hero like his ancestors. —– Rada's last words.\"",

    "content": "Upon seeing these things, Nian Bing understood everything. Rada's voice and smile flashed before his eyes. Her choice to sacrifice herself was to help him forge the Divine Blades, and at the same time, to fulfill her role for her child.\n\nYes! If Xi Lu had remained here, then the Dwarf race on the Divine Continent would have been unable to escape the crisis of extinction in a few years. Only by leaving could Xi Lu survive better.\n\nWhat immense maternal love this was! Nian Bing's eyes blurred once more, and tears dripped onto the stone slab.\n\nAfter a long while, Nian Bing slowly raised his head to look at Xi Lu, who was also in tears. \"Do you hate me? Yes, if I hadn't come, Aunt Rada wouldn't have made such a decision. Without my arrival, your family would still be living together happily. All of this happened because of me. You should hate me. From a certain perspective, I am the murderer of your mother. Go ahead, strike me with your axe. I will not fight back.\" He looked at Xi Lu with calm eyes.\n\nXi Lu met Nian Bing's gaze somewhat blankly. \"Should I kill you? Mother said before she died that I shouldn't hate you, but rather be grateful to you. If it weren't for you, we dwarves who remained here would have perished long ago. You brought us hope. But, Mother is dead, all my relatives are dead, and now only I am left. What should I do? What should I do? Tell me?\"\n\nNian Bing took two steps forward, embracing Xi Lu's broad shoulders. \"Aunt Rada died for me, and at the same time, her death was for you. She hoped you could have a new life and become a hero like your ancestors. Aunt Rada and the others are already old and cannot withstand the hardships, nor can they do much more for the Dwarf race. But you are different. You bear the heavy responsibility of the Dwarf race's revival. If you are willing, Nian Bing's life is yours at any time, but I cannot let you kill me now, because I must fulfill Aunt Rada's wish and take you to the Yangguang Continent. That way, I will not have been ungrateful for Aunt Rada's painstaking efforts. Perhaps you think your loved ones are dead, but from another perspective, they have achieved eternal life in the Six Divine Blades.\"\n\nHis mental power split into six streams and floated out, respectively integrating into the six Divine Blades on the stone table. The blades glowed, then floated up simultaneously. At the same time, six figures of different colors appeared, each holding a Divine Blade.\n\nXi Lu trembled, looking at the six figures in surprise. Although they had the same appearance as Nian Bing, their aura was so familiar.\n\nThey all gazed at Xi Lu gently. Although they didn't speak, they seemed to be encouraging him.\n\n\"My strength is not enough now to awaken their souls within the blades, but I firmly believe that one day I will reach that level. At that time, what kind of person do you hope Aunt Rada will see? Live on strongly and become stronger; that is what you should do, not immerse yourself in grief.\"\n\nAlthough Nian Bing was persuading Xi Lu, his tears could not be stopped. Xi Lu's breathing gradually stabilized. He quietly looked at the six figures, feeling their familiar and gentle aura. His gaze gradually softened.\n\n\"Mother, I won't disappoint you. I understand what you mean. I will leave here with Nian Bing. We are brothers, not enemies. He brings us hope.\" Turning around, Xi Lu looked at Nian Bing, whose face was also covered in tears. Nian Bing was also looking at him. The rift between the two brothers disappeared under the witness of the six shadow puppets. The two figures, one tall and one short, embraced each other and wept openly.\n\nThe release of sorrow in his heart calmed Xi Lu's mind. His crying stopped. With a complex look and a hint of shame, he looked at Nian Bing. \"I'm sorry, my brother. I was too impulsive earlier. Didn't I hurt you? Judging by your appearance, your magic seems to have recovered, and the scales on your body have disappeared. But why can I still not feel the aura of life?\"\n\nNian Bing did not tell Xi Lu everything. Some things were better left unknown for him. He simply explained some of what had happened and told Xi Lu that he had obtained the Celestial Fragrance Fruit and was preparing to go to the Life Domain to find Kao, in order to truly recover his vitality.\n\nUpon hearing Nian Bing's words, Xi Lu forced a smile. \"Brother, then I congratulate you first. My mother told me to return to the Yangguang Continent with you. Should I go with you now, or wait for you?\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment. \"You'd better wait for me here. As soon as my vitality recovers, I'll come back for you and take you with me.\"\n\nBecause of that kiss back then and Kao's peculiar temper, he was not confident that Kao would not harm Xi Lu. It was likely that even he himself would face some difficulties from Kao when trying to recover his vitality. Therefore, he decided it was better for Xi Lu to stay here for now.\n\nXi Lu nodded, looking at the six Divine Blades on the table with deep emotion. \"Then go. I'll wait for you here. Take them all. After being refined by my mother and the elders, these six blades have all become divine artifacts. Not only have they maximized the energy of the blade materials, but they have also undergone some special craftsmanship by our Dwarf race, refined with heart and soul. When you use them, you will feel their difference. The power of a divine artifact is immense. I hope you will preserve them well. Within the blade spirits are the figures of my mother and the others!\"\n\nSeeing Xi Lu's eyes redden again, Nian Bing sighed inwardly, lowered his head, and said, \"If I had known that Aunt Rada and the others decided to forge the blades like this, I would never have agreed. Xi Lu, I can understand how you feel now. If it were me, I might be even more unbearable. But you are not alone now. You are my blood brother, and my parents are your parents.\"\n\nXi Lu sighed. \"Mother also did it for the future of the Dwarf race. In fact, I understand everything in my heart, but it's just hard to accept this fact. Go find the God of Life quickly and strive to recover your vitality as soon as possible, so that we can continue our actions. I will wait for you here and prepare for our journey to the Yangguang Continent. Don't worry, I won't do anything foolish again. My mother's sacrifice has illuminated my path, and I will definitely become a true hero of the Dwarf race.\"\n\nAt this moment, Nian Bing suddenly felt that Xi Lu seemed to have grown up a lot.\n\nXi Lu escorted Nian Bing all the way to the foot of Black Mountain before returning. Nian Bing was afraid that the Zhebies would seek revenge on Xi Lu. He had intended to leave the five great dark creatures in the Demonic Devourer Blade, but Xi Lu told him that as long as he was in the cave on Black Mountain, let alone the Zhebies, even double their number would not be able to harm him. Thus, he refused Nian Bing's kind offer. After bidding farewell to Xi Lu, Nian Bing simply oriented himself and, with the help of wind magic, quickly headed towards Kao's Life Domain.\n\nNian Bing felt a greater affinity for Dark Celestial Fragrance than for Celestial Fragrance. Although he always felt that the person's heart was as dark as the energy she possessed, Celestial Fragrance's help in all aspects was genuine. Compared to Kao, who was aloof and cold, he felt much better.\n\nA swirling white mist gradually appeared before his eyes. If one hadn't actually been inside, no one could have imagined that this layer of thick fog separated two completely different worlds. Floating to the outside of the white mist, Nian Bing stopped and shouted loudly, \"Kao, I'm back! Please open the passage.\"\n\nHe only shouted once before stopping. He knew that with Kao's abilities, she would have sensed his presence long ago. Moreover, her other aspect was Dark Celestial Fragrance, and she should know when he would return.\n\nSo he waited. But after a full meal's time, the white mist before him remained unchanged. Nian Bing was a little stunned. Was Kao refusing to let him in because she was angry with him?\n\nHowever, according to Dark Celestial Fragrance, he still had some value to them. She shouldn't be too harsh on him, should she?\n\nJust as Nian Bing was wondering, a gentle voice suddenly appeared behind him. \"Do you know Kao?\" The voice sounded very comfortable, as if a warmth was flowing through his chest.\n\nNian Bing was greatly alarmed. With his mental power, to be approached so stealthily without him noticing meant this person's strength was truly terrifying. He didn't turn around immediately. He surged forward, and only when he approached the white mist did he turn around. He saw a man of medium build standing three paces behind where he had just been, smiling at him.\n\nThis person was wearing a white robe, with no other decoration. A waterfall of crystal silver hair cascaded over his shoulders. His eyes were strange, purple. It was a deep purple, a gentle purple. The moment their eyes met, Nian Bing felt a wave of drowsiness wash over his brain, as if he wanted to fall asleep immediately.\n\nThe man in white was very handsome, with a gentle beauty. His fair skin was almost flawless. However, Nian Bing noticed that even through his Heavenly Eye acupoint, he couldn't truly sense the energy fluctuations around this person. A powerful, unfathomable expert, this was Nian Bing's assessment of the person before him.\n\nNian Bing was appraising the other person, and the other person was also appraising him. When he saw that Nian Bing's gaze only wavered slightly before recovering, a faint hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.\n\n\"You still haven't answered my question.\" The man in white with silver-purple eyes continued to smile at Nian Bing. His gentle demeanor made Nian Bing feel a sense of favor.\n\n\"Yes, I came here to find the God of Life, Kao, but she hasn't responded. May I ask, who are you?\"\n\nThe man in white smiled slightly. \"My name is Ou Di. It's a pleasure to meet you.\" He took a light step forward, without any energy fluctuation or air movement, and was already beside Nian Bing. He showed a look of apology on his face. \"I'm sorry, Kao not seeing you is probably due to my arrival. I'm here to find her as well. Since you also want to see her, how about I take you in?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred slightly. He didn't say anything more or ask questions, just nodded quietly. Ou Di smiled slightly and, facing the white mist outside the Life Domain, raised his right hand. Space subtly distorted around his fingers. His hand looked like a woman's hand, fair and flawless. With that faint distortion, it slowly inserted into the white mist before him.\n\nThe white mist, which had been constantly swirling, instantly stopped its movement when Ou Di's hand inserted into it. Ou Di smiled and said, \"Wait a moment before moving.\" As he spoke, he gently blew a breath towards the white mist. With a \"poof,\" a ring of ripples spread from the center of the white mist. The mist, in a slight distortion, diffused outwards, and a passage leading inside naturally formed.\n\nOu Di turned back and smiled at Nian Bing. \"Let's go, we can go in now. I just don't know if Kao will welcome us.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Ou Di before him and suddenly smiled. \"Controlling the order of everything, you must be the God of Order, right?\"\n\nOu Di looked at Nian Bing in surprise. \"It seems you know quite a lot! No wonder you came here to find Kao. But your aura seems to be the kind Kao dislikes the most. I won't be able to protect you once we're inside; everything will depend on yourself. I wonder when the gods would produce a powerful being like you. It seems I really should pay attention to the order of this continent.\"\n\nHe said he was powerful?\n\nNian Bing's heart moved, and he understood something. The reason Ou Di called him powerful was probably because of his mental power. The moment they made eye contact, Ou Di must have tested him. Although he didn't understand the nature of the test, he had discerned some of his strength from his mental power, which was why he said that.\n\nWithout further explanation, he followed Ou Di and walked into Kao's Life Domain.\n\nPassing through the white mist again, with every step forward, Nian Bing could clearly feel the life aura in the surrounding air becoming denser. The uncomfortable feeling, even more so than the last time, made him instinctively use his mental power. Seven-colored light enveloped his body, completely isolating his aura from the outside. Only then could he share in the surging life aura and feel much more comfortable.\n\nOu Di walked slowly, like an ordinary person. Every movement of his exuded a touch of elegance, like a noble gentleman.\n\nThe Life Realm once again appeared before his eyes, filling Nian Bing with a yearning for life.",

    "content": "Although the aura of death was equally powerful, he preferred the aura of life. It was the vibrant and passionate vitality that he most desired. Oudi stopped after passing through the white mist, not venturing into the plants before him. He gazed at the giant tree in the lake, smiled slightly, and said calmly, \"An old friend visits. I hope I haven't bothered Miss Kao.\"\n\nKao's cold voice echoed from the treehouse, \"Have you ever *not* bothered me?\" The previously calm and clear lake water suddenly rippled. Waves surged from beneath the tree, and Kao, dressed in a green gown, landed gracefully on the lake's surface, carried by the waves to the shore, floating serenely there. Her gaze was entirely focused on Oudi, seemingly oblivious to Nianbing's presence. Nianbing remained silent, standing behind Oudi. He was well aware of the disparity in strength between himself and these true gods. A wise person would never do anything foolish.\n\nOudi looked at Kao, his eyes radiating a gentle glow. \"Miss Kao, Oudi has come uninvited, merely because I suddenly sensed Miss Tianxiang's presence. Perhaps you can give me an explanation.\"\n\nKao's cold voice replied, \"We will both abide by our agreement, and Tianxiang will too. She has merely left Green Mountain temporarily for new cultivation. What? Do you have any questions?\"\n\nThe smile on Oudi's face never wavered. \"No questions, really. It's just that the Divine Continent has seemed a bit unsettled lately, and Miss Tianxiang's aura suddenly vanishing has made Oudi a little worried.\"\n\nKao said indifferently, \"Then you may return. Within three days, Tianxiang will reappear. I assume you've also learned of the Vial of Moertas's Seal from those gods. Are you planning to interfere again?\"\n\nOudi replied, \"No, of course not. That is a matter for humans, and it has little to do with us, as long as what we do not wish to see does not appear. What does anything else matter to me?\"\n\nKao gazed at Oudi's violet eyes. \"Your abilities seem to have improved considerably. This body should be fully integrated by now. If you've come here today to show off, you may try.\" As she spoke, she slowly raised her right hand, and tiny green light dots gathered at her fingertips.\n\nOudi's smile remained, but a hint of solemnity flickered in his eyes. Distorted light flickered around him. \"Actually, there's not much point in a conflict between us, is there?\"\n\nKao said coldly, \"If you truly thought that, then all this would have ended long ago. You came here alone. Aren't you afraid I'll keep you here? I believe I have the ability to do so.\"\n\nOudi's expression shifted slightly. \"I merely came to inquire about Miss Tianxiang. After all, we are old friends. If Miss Tianxiang is in any difficulty, I would be happy to help.\"\n\nKao snorted. \"Help? You're here to probe the situation between us two. Do you think we *must* choose as you do to continue resisting you?\" The green light completely illuminated her hand. Kao's body, floating in the air, suddenly swayed slightly. A faint shadow appeared behind her without any warning. This shadow emitted no aura, but its clear form startled Nianbing. It was clearly Tianxiang!\n\nThis time, the smile on Oudi's face finally vanished. He leaned forward slightly. \"In that case, we shall meet again. I hope the two ladies remain as they are. Oh, right, this young brother is also here to see you. I wonder what he needs. Oudi won't keep you any longer.\" As soon as he finished speaking, Nianbing suddenly felt his body tremble. He was instantly pulled away from his original position, directly in front of Oudi. At the same time, the blood within him inexplicably stopped flowing. After a moment of stagnation, it broke free from Nianbing's control and began to flow backward. Even his mental power was instantly sealed. With a muffled groan, Nianbing spat out a mouthful of black blood.\n\n\"How dare you!\" Kao was furious. Her green figure, with the black phantom behind her, instantly appeared before Nianbing. Tianxiang's phantom struck Nianbing's chest with a palm. The black blood he spat out vanished instantly, and Kao then attacked Oudi directly behind Nianbing.\n\nOudi was even more surprised than the enraged Kao. As he broke through Nianbing's mental defenses with his palm, he suddenly felt a peculiar fluctuation. Immediately afterward, seven beams of light appeared almost simultaneously behind Nianbing. Blue, red, cyan, yellow, silver, white, and black light flashed instantly, cutting off his attack on Nianbing. The black shadow, in particular, brought forth a sharp aura of death with its black blade, directly attacking Oudi's true form. While he wasn't afraid of such a coordinated attack, he dreaded the approaching Kao. Even with his arrogance, he would never dare to confront Kao and Tianxiang simultaneously. Fearing entanglement by the black shadow, the distorted light expanded, changing the direction of the black light attacking him. The white mist behind him churned violently, and his figure vanished. The space distorted completely, forcibly blocking Kao's pursuit. Kao's eyes flashed with cold light. A small green arrow floated from her palm, drilling into the white mist and disappearing.\n\nOudi's voice echoed from outside. \"The green hills will remain, and the clear waters will flow. Until we meet again, when we shall decide the victor. I didn't expect to misjudge. It turns out he was just an ordinary demigod. Hahaha, er... \" The last sound was a muffled groan. The distorted space within the life domain disappeared, and Oudi's groan, which had been clear, instantly became faint to the point of being imperceptible.\n\nThe逆流 (nìliú - reverse flow) of blood halted and then returned to normal. If Nianbing's body hadn't been extraordinary, the rapid reversal and subsequent return of his blood would have killed him. He spat out another mouthful of blood and used his mental power to regain control of his blood flow, feeling slightly better. The seven beams of light required no control and had already surrounded him. The hilts of the seven divine blades touched his body, and seven pure magical energies were infused into him, calming his injured physique. A faint seven-colored light merged with his mental power, forming a domain about ten feet in diameter. The seven-colored light flashed, bringing vibrant fluctuations to this domain filled with the aura of life. Divine artifacts and divine artifacts were entirely different concepts. The seven pure magical elements were absorbed and transformed by the seven divine blades themselves. Although there were no magical elements in this life domain, they could inject their stored magical elements into Nianbing's body, invigorating his magic and resolving his discomfort in coordination with his mental power.\n\nTianxiang's black shadow disappeared. Kao's cold gaze fell upon the black blood Nianbing had spat onto the plants. The plant withered upon contact with the black blood, which carried the aura of death. The area around Nianbing, about ten feet, had been flattened by the flashing of the seven magical energies. Even the aura of life was blocked by this seven-colored light. Even with Kao's domain as a true god, she couldn't harm Nianbing in the slightest with the power of the seven divine artifacts. Kao looked up. Her gaze at Nianbing became somewhat complex but quickly returned to normal.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Nianbing recovered. The seven-colored light dimmed simultaneously, not entering the space ring, but directly merging into his body. The recovered Nianbing felt a sense of lingering fear. When Oudi attacked him, it was precisely the seven divine artifacts within him that had resolved most of the impact. Otherwise, the reverse blood flow would have instantly reached a critical point, and even his robust body would have been destined to explode. Nianbing thought of Rada of the dwarves, and he couldn't help but sigh inwardly, \"Aunt Rada. You saved me!\"\n\nWith his consciousness restored, Nianbing immediately saw Kao's unfriendly gaze and awkwardly said, \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to damage your domain.\"\n\nKao snorted. \"Well said, God of Order. Their audacity is growing. They dare to fight in my domain. However, you have also surprised me. To emerge unscathed from Oudi's attack. Besides myself and Tianxiang, you are the first. Although you relied on external means, Tianxiang certainly didn't misjudge you.\"\n\nNianbing said, \"He really is the God of Order, Oudi. His abilities are very strange. Why does it seem like he can control my body? He can even control my blood.\"\n\nKao replied, \"Among the three of them, Oudi is the strongest. Do you think the title 'God of Order' is just for show? His strongest ability is to control everything. You can also think of him as the most powerful spatial mage in this world. There is nothing he cannot control. He focused on you because of your mental power, and that's why he suddenly attacked you before leaving. If it weren't for those few blades of yours, you would likely be dead by now. Even I am not confident of defeating him alone. His greatest characteristic is change, and I cannot predict his methods of attack. However, what you have seen is not the God of Order in his complete state. As the strongest of those three, he is also the most insidious. Only when he is with the God of Time does he become the strongest. If Tianxiang and I didn't have some special abilities, we would have been defeated by the three of them last time.\"\n\nThis was the most Kao had spoken to Nianbing, and it made him feel somewhat strange. The current Kao seemed much more humane, no longer as unapproachable. After thinking for a moment, Nianbing said, \"He came here to find you probably because the aura of death in Death Waterfall has suddenly weakened. However, since he broke the millennia-old tradition of combat, he must be quite confident in his strength. Kao, aren't you afraid that the three of them will attack you together? It would be better to prepare earlier.\" Oudi's attack made Nianbing trust Kao and Tianxiang a little more. Behind their surface gentleness and elegance lay despicable actions, which strengthened Nianbing's resolve to help Kao and Tianxiang through their difficulties. Of course, this was on the premise that Kao was willing to help him recover his vitality.\n\nKao shook her head. \"No, they won't come again, at least not for now. Do you think Tianxiang and I are so easily bullied? If that were the case, we would have died long ago. After tens of thousands of years of survival, those three have become extremely selfish. Although they are confident they can defeat us two, if they want to kill us, then at least two of them would perish with us. This is a situation they absolutely do not want to see. Therefore, before they have absolute confidence, they will abide by the oath of battle every thousand years. Tianxiang and I are one, unlike their situation. No matter how much Tianxiang and I fight amongst ourselves, we are still one entity. Do you know why Oudi came to find me? Because he is afraid. All three of them are afraid.\"\n\nNianbing was taken aback. \"Afraid? What else could they be afraid of?\" He found it difficult to comprehend that the God of Order, one of the strongest individuals in this world, would be afraid of anything.\n\nA rare smile appeared on Kao's ordinary face. \"Because he is afraid of Tianxiang and I integrating into one. From the moment the five of us were created, Tianxiang and I were one level higher than the three of them. The reason we maintained a balanced state was that there was a problem during our creation. We can say that we are both incomplete products. That's why personality splitting and ability splitting occurred. Once we transform from incomplete products to complete ones and everything is fully integrated, it will be the time of their destruction. Therefore, they have always been afraid.\"\n\nNianbing looked at Kao in surprise. \"Then, after so many years of cultivation, haven't you and Tianxiang thought of a way to integrate? There must be a way.\"\n\nKao gave a bitter smile and shook her head. \"We have considered every possibility and have experimented countless times, but we have never succeeded. We are two absolute extremes, so how can integration be easy? Complete integration is almost impossible to achieve. At most, we can only reach a semi-integrated state, and only in that semi-integrated state can we contend with those three.\"\n\nNianbing's eyes lit up. \"Perhaps I can offer you some help. In the human world, I am a mage, a mage with both ice and fire origins. Ice and fire are also two extremes, but through my continuous cultivation, I have already fused them. In my understanding, all energy in the world has commonalities. As long as that common point is found, integration is not impossible! Oh, right, there's also frequency. At a specific frequency, with that common point as the core, integration can likely be completed.\"",

    "content": "Upon hearing Nian Bing's words, Ka'ao fell into deep thought. After a long while, she suddenly flashed before Nian Bing, grabbing his right hand. A surge of life essence forcibly entered Nian Bing's deathly body, causing him intense pain that he almost cried out. But Nian Bing knew Ka'ao was trying to sense the mystery of his ice and fire fusion. He forcefully suppressed the discomfort in his body with his mental power, opening himself up completely for her to feel. The fusion of ice and fire had reached great mastery, with blue and red light merging within Nian Bing's body. The other five magical elements circled around him, and as Ka'ao felt his fused magical power, her eyes grew brighter. It was clear she had figured some things out. Although she couldn't be entirely sure herself, Nian Bing had provided her with a completely new idea. Commonality, what is the commonality between death and life?\n\nReleasing his hand, Ka'ao stepped back, still deep in thought. Nian Bing breathed a sigh of relief. Ka'ao's touch was precise; her control over life energy was miraculous and had not harmed him. Ka'ao was thinking, and so was he. Nian Bing was a thoughtful person, whether cultivating culinary arts or magic, he often engaged in long periods of contemplation. Those special magic arrays were conceived and utilized by him through constant thinking. While thinking, he murmured, \"Life and death are polar opposites. What could be common between them?\"\n\nIn thought, time often passes quickly. Everything in the realm of life is composed of Ka'ao's energy, so time's passage is imperceptible. After an unknown amount of time, Ka'ao shook her head in dejection. \"No, it's still no good. There's no common point. Your ice and fire, to a certain extent, are both magical energies, based on magical elements, and both possess a life aura. Ice is a cold, stable, calm life, while fire is a passionate, intense, burning life. Life and primal energy are their common ground. But life and death are different. From the day the world was born, these two energies have been in opposition. This opposition is both absolute and relative. From any perspective, they belong to a vast category, each being the other's opposite. How can a common point be found? It can't. It still can't. I understand the frequency you mentioned. My partial fusion with Tianxiang is based on frequency, but your method of fusing ice and fire through commonality doesn't apply to us.\" After saying this, she shook her head in disappointment.\n\nHearing Ka'ao speak, Nian Bing also emerged from his thoughts. He had considered the same things Ka'ao had. Indeed, as Ka'ao said, the opposition between life and death is entirely different from the opposition between magical elements; they are not on the same level. He couldn't think of a good solution either. \"Ka'ao, don't be discouraged. Since the one who created you could become the strongest god, there must be a way. You are absolutely right, reaching that level is very difficult, but I always have a feeling that life and death energies can definitely fuse in a special aura.\"\n\nKa'ao sighed. \"In your understanding, we may have a lot of time, but for us who have lived for fifty thousand years, time is running out. If we can't find a solution before the next decisive battle, our defeat in the fight against those three is inevitable. Moreover, while we are thinking of ways to improve, they are also constantly working. Perhaps they will come up with a way to completely destroy us without destroying themselves. Tianxiang and I don't care much about our lives, but deep down, our greatest goal is to defeat them.\"\n\nSeeing Ka'ao's dejected look, Nian Bing felt a surge of emotion. He took a step forward and took her hand. \"Ka'ao, I will definitely help you. I don't know who is right or wrong between you. But you helped me, helping me regain my life. I will repay this kindness. Two heads are better than one; I think we will find a way, won't we?\" Holding her hand, which was full of life, Nian Bing felt uncomfortable, but his heart felt very comfortable. This was the first time he had felt this way since arriving on the Continent of Gods. Although he knew his strength was far inferior to Ka'ao and Tianxiang, the impulse in his heart was strong, especially when he saw a glimmer of joy appear in Ka'ao's vacant eyes, which further affirmed his decision.\n\nKa'ao gently withdrew her hand from Nian Bing's, a blush appearing on her face. \"Thank you. I don't know why, but I suddenly feel very confident. Perhaps you are right; there will always be a way. You've been on the Continent of Gods for some time. Let me restore your vitality first, and then I'll have the Dragon God send you and that little dwarf back to the Continent of Light.\"\n\nNian Bing was somewhat surprised. \"You know about Xilu?\"\n\nKa'ao smiled faintly. \"Is there anything I don't know if I want to know? The dwarf race has great courage. The reason I was willing to help them was that I admired the Lost Empire more. Nothing is absolute. When you go back, you can do as you please. Only by completely opening your heart can you reach our level. Nian Bing, before I restore your vitality, may I ask you to do something?\" She used a questioning tone, and Nian Bing's heart warmed. He knew Ka'ao now considered him a friend, not an object of use. He suddenly realized he no longer disliked her cold demeanor; compared to Tianxiang, she possessed more sincerity. Though not obvious, he could clearly feel it.\n\n\"What is it? Tell me. Is it the Hundred Flower Dew? I'd love to try it too. Of course, that would require your help.\" Making the Hundred Flower Dew was both his master, Zha Ji's, wish and his own.\n\nKa'ao shook her head, a faint blush on her cheeks. \"You are currently in a state of death, and all the flowers here possess the life-force of spirit. Making the Hundred Flower Dew now might not achieve the best results. It's not too late to do it after you recover your vitality. What I want you to do is that food you made for the dwarves, the thing that looks delicious. I followed you with my divine sense into their cave. The dwarves seemed very happy seeing the food you made. From the day we were born, Tianxiang and I have only eaten energy and very ordinary food. After awakening from our slumber, we have stayed together on this Continent of Gods. Although we are called gods, our bodies are still human bodies, and we haven't lost our sense of taste. So, I want to eat what you make.\"\n\nSeeing Ka'ao's somewhat shy expression, Nian Bing couldn't help but smile. \"This is too simple. You know, I'm more confident in my cooking than my magic. Even if everyone on this Continent of Gods is a god, when it comes to cooking, I doubt anyone can match me. Oh, wait. I don't have any ingredients for cooking here. After cooking for the dwarves, I gave them all my ingredients. Without ingredients, I can't do anything. Even the cleverest housewife can't cook without rice.\" Looking at Ka'ao with regret, Nian Bing truly wanted to fulfill her wish. Moreover, he hadn't properly cooked in a long time, and his desire for culinary arts was no less than his desire to increase his strength.\n\nKa'ao chuckled lightly. \"Did you forget? I am a god! When you left the dwarves, I brought back all the ingredients you left.\" With a wave of her green sleeve, various ingredients appeared before Nian Bing. These ingredients, having been stored for a long time, were no longer fresh. However, under the effect of Ka'ao's surging life energy, they looked as good as new.\n\nNian Bing looked at Ka'ao, somewhat stunned. He suddenly realized that Ka'ao's ordinary face possessed a different kind of beauty. \"Ka'ao, I like this humanized side of you more. It's a pity Tianxiang can't appear with you, otherwise, I could have let you both taste my cooking.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he released his various cooking utensils from his spatial ring.\n\nKa'ao smiled faintly. \"How could she not taste it? Although I control my body now, her soul still exists. Whatever I eat, she can also feel it. Hurry up and cook. We've been eating together all along. Tianxiang's soul asks me to thank you for not forgetting her.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"How could I forget? She left a deep impression on me!\" As he said this, he couldn't help but recall the deep kiss he shared with Ka'ao and Tianxiang, and his face turned slightly red. Who was Ka'ao? How could she not see Nian Bing's thoughts? She gave him a playful nudge, \"No wicked thoughts. Hurry up and cook. I'm very curious about what human cuisine can produce. Just thinking about the legendary food the dwarves talked about makes me very interested. Didn't Tianxiang tell you? Actually, what we want most is to live an ordinary life.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, thought for a moment, and pointed at the ground with his left hand. A mound of earth suddenly emerged from the ground, which had been churned by magical elements. The Great Awakening Melody appeared in Nian Bing's hand, and the earth element stored in the Longevity Stone continuously seeped into the ground, merging with the soil. Under Nian Bing's mental control, the form gradually changed. In a short while, an earthen stove and a kitchen counter appeared before him.\n\nLooking at the stove and counter before him, Nian Bing's eyes changed distinctly. It was a look of intense desire, calm yet filled with profound emotion. With a flip of his wrist, the Longevity Saber merged into his body. He looked up at Ka'ao and said, \"There are only ordinary ingredients here, so I'll simply cook something for you. If there's a chance to go to the Continent of Light in the future, I'll definitely cook something better for you to taste. My cooking mainly involves grilling, frying, stir-frying, braising, and stewing, along with some auxiliary methods. Today, I'll make five dishes for you to try. I haven't cooked in a long time, and to avoid my death aura affecting the ingredients, I'll simply make some of my specialties.\"\n\nWith a wave of his left hand, a gust of wind arose, and a piece of pork fell before Nian Bing. His hand, wrapped in mental power, did not let any death aura leak out. Looking at the pork, Nian Bing's gaze became focused. He raised his right hand, and with a gust of wind, the Proud Heaven Saber, the gentle murmur of the Wind of Freedom, floated out from his body and fell into his grasp. He picked up the pork with his left hand, and with a light cut on the edge of the pork with his right hand, the skin and meat were separated. Nian Bing skillfully grasped the separated pork skin, and the Proud Heaven Saber moved along the edge, completely separating the meat from the skin. He flipped the Proud Heaven Saber and set the pork aside, while his left hand spread the pork skin flat on the cutting board. Although this process sounds complicated, it actually only took a few blinks of an eye.\n\nA snow fish was picked out of the ingredients by Nian Bing and placed on the cutting board. Although the snow fish was already dead, under the effect of Ka'ao's life energy, it seemed as if it had just died. The snow fish was flicked into the air, enveloped by the wind, and this fatty, tender, scale-less fish was processed in a short while, with its head, tail, and internal organs removed, leaving only the thick fish body.\n\nWith a crack, the snow fish landed precisely on the pork skin. The knife in Nian Bing's hand had already been changed. A blue light with a cold aura appeared in his hand. After a brief observation of the snow fish, Nian Bing's right hand suddenly became a blur, and the physical knife also disappeared. Only the crisp 'pa pa' sound echoed in the air. The enhancement of his physical abilities had greatly improved Nian Bing's functions in all aspects. Although he hadn't used these precious knives for cooking in days, his movements were not rusty at all. The well-arranged blue knife light appeared dense and rhythmic. He wasn't using the knife to cut the snow fish but to repeatedly pound it with the back of the knife.\n\nKa'ao stood before Nian Bing. She indeed possessed great strength, but when it came to cooking, she was utterly clueless, like a rolling pin. Watching the Morning Dew Saber create a mist of ice in Nian Bing's hands, its back repeatedly striking the snow fish, gradually turning it into minced fish, her eyes widened. Her focus was no less than Nian Bing's, as if she were afraid of missing a single move.\n\nAmidst the crisp cracking sounds, the snow fish was finally completely turned into minced fish, yet the Morning Dew Saber remained spotless. With a hidden glint of cold light, Nian Bing smiled as he looked at the minced fish adhering to the pork skin. \"It seems my skills haven't regressed.\" His spatial ring lit up with a silver glow, and a small cloth pouch appeared on the kitchen counter. Nian Bing stroked it with his right hand, picked out a medium-sized Ghost Carving from the pouch, and with a tremor of his wrist, a faint blue light, like a wisp of flame, danced in Nian Bing's hand.",

    "content": "With the faint blue light emanating from his right hand, he touched the fish. As *Ghost Carving* moved slowly, it burrowed in and out of the snow fish paste. Some shiny things were picked out by the faint blue light; they were indeed the fish bones and sinews of the snow fish. In a short while, his right hand switched to the *Aotian Blade*, and he lightly skimmed the surface of the pork skin, completely sending the fish paste into the bowl. A faint blue light appeared on his hand, and a large bowl was instantly covered with a layer of frost.\n\nAn iron pot was placed on the stove, with ice elements condensing in the pot and fire elements blazing underneath. A pot of water boiled within a few breaths. *Nian Bing*, with the light of ice and fire flashing on his hands, skillfully operated, placing the pork skin into the water and boiling it in the simmering water.\n\nThe flame on *Nian Bing*'s hand turned from red to blue, and the temperature increased. Under his deliberate control, the pork skin was cooked until tender in a short while. The *Aotian Blade* probed into the pot, and with a slight stir, the wind broke the water, mixing the pork skin into shreds. The fire cleared. He no longer paid attention to the iron pot, leaving it on the stove to cool. He then took out the shrimp from the ingredients and made it into a paste as well. Every movement he made was as smooth as flowing water, perfectly harmonious and pleasing to the eye, without any flaws.\n\nAlthough he had observed *Nian Bing*'s cooking process in secret before, *Kao* could not discern what *Nian Bing* was doing now. She could only watch in astonishment. Until now, her injured feet were the only things that attracted her. Her appetite was no different from that of ordinary people, and the smell of the boiled pork skin did not stir any sensation in her.\n\nThe shrimp paste was made, and the pork skin soup beside it had cooled down a bit. *Nian Bing* quickly switched between several small bottles in his hand, adding a little seasoning to the soup and stirring it evenly. At the same time, he also put the shrimp paste into a bowl, freezing it as well.\n\nCarrots and spinach appeared in *Nian Bing*'s hands simultaneously. He paused slightly, took out the fish paste prepared earlier, and divided it into three portions, placing each in a bowl. The spinach and carrots were washed clean under the effect of ice melting water. This time, *Nian Bing* displayed his top-quality blade in front of *Kao*. The spinach was tossed into the air and immediately rolled up by a green light, as if a small tornado had enveloped it. If *Kao* hadn't had extremely sharp eyesight, she wouldn't have been able to see what he was doing. The spinach, under the sweep of the green light, gradually turned into extremely fine shreds. Strangely, not a drop of the spinach juice spilled out, completely contained within the sweep of the blade. When the green light disappeared, these vegetable scraps, along with their juice, entered one of the three bowls of fish paste. The same thing happened with the carrots. Carrot shreds with fresh red juice entered another bowl. *Nian Bing* then took out the pork he had set aside at the beginning. He cut a small piece with the *Aotian Blade*, tossed it into the air, and the wind element wrapped around the pork, preventing it from falling. Simultaneously, a flame emerged from his left hand, roasting the pork in the air. While roasting, *Nian Bing*'s *Aotian Blade* occasionally swung out, leaving marks on the pork.\n\nThe roasted meat finally released an aroma. Coupled with the various seasonings *Nian Bing* kept sprinkling, the fragrance gradually became more and more enticing. *Kao*, who had always been patient, felt a sense of impatience at this moment. Watching the pork tumbling in the air, roasted by the constantly changing red and blue flames, she secretly swallowed a mouthful of saliva, thinking to herself, \"This thing looks much tastier than flowers.\"\n\nThis dish made by *Nian Bing* was extremely complex to prepare, and everything done so far was just a prelude. A small piece of roasted pork didn't take too long to cook. When the pork reached the degree of satisfaction for *Nian Bing*, his movements changed. The *Aotian Blade* brought up countless wind blades that wrapped around the pork. Just like the spinach and carrots before, the pork turned into minced meat. However, this time he didn't put the roasted minced meat into the fish paste but took out a separate bowl to store it.\n\nAfter completing all this, *Nian Bing* smiled slightly at *Kao* and said, \"The preparation is done. Please bear with me a little longer, and it will be ready soon.\" As he spoke, his left hand touched the iron pot beside him. The pork skin soup, which had become warm, turned into pork skin jelly under the gradual strengthening of the ice element. *Nian Bing* picked up the iron pot, poured out the pork skin jelly, and cut it into small cubes with sides of two fen with the help of the *Aotian Blade*, placing them aside.\n\nFresh water was added to the iron pot again, and a red flame rose from the stove under *Nian Bing*'s magic, slowly heating the iron pot. At this time, *Nian Bing*'s movements quickened. He first added several different seasonings into the three bowls of fish paste respectively and then stirred them quickly. The fish paste with spinach and carrots turned red and green, respectively, forming a crystal-clear three-color with the other bowl of white fish paste. *Nian Bing* put away his blade, and his hands moved as if by magic.\n\nThe fish paste in *Nian Bing*'s hands was immediately flattened under the effect of the ice and wind elements. *Nian Bing* added the minced pork to the green fish paste and then rolled it into a smooth green fish ball, placing it into the iron pot that was being heated. Then, he flattened the red fish paste, added the shrimp paste into it, and also made it into a red ball. Finally, in the last fish paste, he added a piece of the cut pork skin jelly and also placed it into the pot. His movements were extremely fast. *Kao* only saw red, green, and white fish balls alternately falling into the pot. In a short while, all the ingredients prepared by *Nian Bing* disappeared. Just as all the materials turned into fish balls, the water in the pot finally boiled.\n\n*Nian Bing*'s expression became focused. He leaned forward, picked up a pair of chopsticks with his right hand, inserted them into the center of the water, and began to stir gently in the pot. In the boiling water, the three-colored fish balls, flashing with crystal-clear red, green, and white colors, revolved rapidly with the chopsticks as the axis. This was *Breaking Water Surface Jade Hand*. Although this was not the true *Jade Hand*, its effect was no less. At the same time, his other hand, carrying the aura of fire elements, pressed against the side of the pot, constantly adjusting the intensity of the flame, causing the water in the pot to change gradually.\n\nFinally, as the three-colored fish balls became even more crystal-clear, *Nian Bing* waved his hands repeatedly. Red soul vinegar and various seasonings were added to the pot, along with the premium chicken broth he had prepared, creating a steaming bowl of fish ball soup.\n\nThe fresh and fragrant aroma assailed the senses, causing *Kao* to momentarily lose herself. She instinctively walked to the side of the pot and looked with longing eyes as *Nian Bing* poured the fish ball soup into a large bowl. She murmured, \"Can I eat it now?\"\n\n*Nian Bing* smiled slightly and pushed the large bowl in front of *Kao*. \"Please, Miss *Kao*, taste my dish, 'Ice and Fire Glazed Pearl Grains.' The biggest feature of this dish lies in the combination of various seasonings used in cooking. There is nothing special about the culinary skills themselves. Any chef with skillful hands and a meticulous mind can make it. However, I am confident that it is difficult to achieve this level of heat and coordinate so many seasonings. I believe the taste of this bowl of 'Ice and Fire Glazed Pearl Grains' will satisfy you. Eat it first, and I will make something else for you.\" This 'Ice and Fire Glazed Pearl Grains' was a famous dish originally taught to *Nian Bing* by *Cha Ji* and was also one of *Nian Bing*'s favorite foods. Its taste was very unique, especially the combination of snow fish paste and pork skin jelly. When the fish balls were cooked, the pork skin jelly inside would melt into a delicious juice. With one bite, the fresh and fragrant aroma was incomparable. Although *Nian Bing* said it lightly, preparing this dish was not easy for a chef, at least not everyone could make it. It was extremely rare for someone to do it as perfectly as *Nian Bing*.\n\n*Kao* looked at the large bowl in front of her, then at the three different colored fish balls that resembled pearls, and for a moment, she felt reluctant to take a bite. *Nian Bing* prepared the next dish and smiled, \"Eat quickly. This dish tastes best when eaten hot. You can eat slowly and fully experience the changes in the various flavors. Those are the most wonderful feelings! Oh, yes, be careful when eating the white fish ball, don't get scalded by the juice inside.\" At this moment, he had forgotten *Kao*'s identity, and had forgotten that *Kao*, with her abilities, would not be afraid of being scalded. He himself was a chef, and *Kao* was a diner tasting the food.\n\nThe three delicious fish balls were slowly entered into *Kao*'s mouth. Hundreds of flavor changes instantly activated her taste buds. The delicious sensation made *Kao*'s pores seem to open up. The surrounding plants, under the effect of her accelerated release of life aura, grew with rhythmic fluctuations. The divine light in her eyes became somewhat hazy. Unconsciously, the black figure behind her emerged. Yes! Now, it wasn't just her who was eating, but also that Dark Heavenly Fragrance with the aura of death.\n\nFive dishes were served one by one, each with its own characteristics, either fresh and fragrant or refreshing, which greatly broadened *Kao*'s horizons. For her, digesting food was a very simple matter. By the time she had completely consumed all the food, including the process of *Nian Bing* making it, a full hour had passed.\n\n\"How is it? Is my cooking acceptable?\" *Nian Bing* asked with a smile, confident in his skills.\n\n*Kao* raised her head, looked at *Nian Bing* with a complex expression, and said softly, \"Do people on your *Yangguang Continent* eat these things every day?\"\n\n*Nian Bing* nodded, then shook his head. \"To be precise, they eat similar things. However, it is not easy to taste the delicacies made by me. Chefs like me are not common on the *Yangguang Continent*. If you have the chance to visit the *Yangguang Continent*, I will get the best seasonings and make a table of my signature seven-element feast for you. Those are what I am best at. My nickname is, after all, *Magic Chef*. Although I am not the first to cook with magic, I can be considered a pioneer.\"\n\nA wry smile appeared on *Kao*'s face. \"Nian Bing, it's over.\"\n\n*Nian Bing* was stunned. \"What? Did I not cook well?\"\n\n*Kao* shook her head, and a hint of girlish shyness appeared on her face. \"No, what I mean is, after eating what you made, how can I continue to live here? I can't wait to go to the *Yangguang Continent* with you right now, and not care about anything else, just eating what you make every day. How wonderful would that be!\"\n\n*Nian Bing* smiled. As a chef, receiving recognition from diners was the happiest thing. \"Of course, that's possible. When you and *Tian Xiang* have finished all your matters and arrive at the *Yangguang Continent*, I will definitely make delicious food for you every day, changing the recipes. I always keep my word, so you must work hard and strive to defeat those three guys as soon as possible. Oh, speaking of which, the most regrettable thing for me is not being able to participate in this year's Chef God Competition. Judging by the time, the results of the Chef God Competition have probably already come out. I wonder who won the final championship. It's only held once every five years, so I can only wait for the next one.\"\n\n*Kao* smiled and said, \"What you made is simply too delicious. Although I don't understand your culinary skills very well, this taste and eating experience are an absolute enjoyment. It seems that *Tian Xiang* and I have lived for fifty thousand years in vain, not knowing that human food can reach this level. In the delicacies you made, the aura of magic elements is mixed in, and the various energies in the food are fully brought out by the culinary skills, making the life force of the food fully displayed. This is simply too wonderful. I would rather starve than eat flowers again.\" A hint of longing appeared on her face. *Nian Bing* understood that *Kao* was currently envisioning her future life on the *Yangguang Continent*.\n\n\"Human life is colorful, and eating is just one aspect of it. To fully experience these, you must become an ordinary person, otherwise, you will continue to live in loneliness like you do now. For an ordinary person, family affection, love, and friendship are all indispensable things. Frankly speaking, although you and *Tian Xiang* possess powerful strength, do you know what happiness is?\"\n\n\"Happiness?\" *Kao* looked at *Nian Bing* somewhat blankly, clearly not having a deep understanding of this word.\n\n\"Yes, happiness. Happiness is a feeling. Everyone's feeling is different, but if you can have this feeling, it is definitely the most beautiful thing for humans. Perhaps, when you were eating what I made just now, you have felt happiness. You have to experience it yourself gradually.\"\n\n*Kao* nodded and looked at *Nian Bing* with a smile. \"I can be sure that I feel very happy right now. *Nian Bing*, thank you. Do you know? I'm somewhat reluctant to let you leave now. I wish you could stay here with *Tian Xiang* and me forever.\"\n\n*Nian Bing* shook his head. \"I'm sorry, if you consider me a friend, then let me leave. On the *Yangguang Continent*, there are people waiting for me, and I always miss them. Moreover, there are too many things I want to do there that I haven't done. The future is beautiful, *Kao*. I believe that one day you and *Tian Xiang* will achieve true happiness. Your lives are eternal, and this time will not be too long. I firmly believe this.\"",

    "content": "Cao smiled slightly and said, \"Don't worry, I won't force you. You know, in all these years, this is the first time I've received a favor. I finally understand why those dwarves were so moved after eating what you made. These dishes represent more than just food; they are a form of hope, and also, happiness. Thank you. I will repay this kindness sooner or later. Although my time with you wasn't long, you made me feel like a person, not a god. It feels so good to be human! This sense of ease is probably what Tianxiang and I have been pursuing.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Yes! It's great to be human. There are countless gods on this Divine Continent, but how many of them are happy? This includes you and those three True Gods. However, you are all immortal gods, so you will always have the chance to feel happiness.\"\n\nCao said, \"Having received your favor, there are some things I should tell you. Actually, you know, Tianxiang and I have been showing weakness.\"\n\nNian Bing was startled and asked, \"Showing weakness? Do you mean your strength is already enough to defeat those three fellows?\"\n\nCao shook her head and said, \"No, that's not it. The strength of the two of us is indeed inferior to theirs. What I mean by showing weakness is how they perceive us. As the Three Great True Gods, they do possess extremely powerful strength, but after all, they are not based on their original human bodies. The human body still has a certain gap compared to the dragon race. Think about it, even the dragon race will die after thirty thousand years. Let alone humans!\n\nThe current situation on the Divine Continent has existed for about twenty thousand years, perhaps less. And the first batch of gods and men have long since died. Why is this? It's because the limit of a human body is to live only to ten thousand years old. No matter how strong one is, they will die at ten thousand years old. Those three fellows are no exception. The reason they survived is that every ten thousand years, they have to switch to a new body, transferring their souls and abilities to another perfect body through special methods, expelling the other's soul and taking the body for themselves. This process is extremely dangerous. If not for their own strong power, there would have been problems. However, although this practice of snatching other people's bodies can sustain life, it also has a drawback. Because of the fusion of souls,\n\ntheir mental power can never reach the peak realm. On the mental level, they have always been lagging behind us. It's just that Tianxiang and I have never displayed mental power stronger than theirs, which makes them believe that we also need to switch bodies. And they are men, so finding bodies to switch to is much easier. As for Tianxiang and I, because of our inherent perfection and our bodies with combined souls, it's too difficult to find perfect bodies to switch to. Therefore, they all assume we are constantly degenerating. Also, we deliberately change our outward appearance every ten thousand years, making this illusion even more pronounced.\n\nThus, although Tianxiang and I are no longer as strong as them, we have an advantage in terms of mental power. In a sense, to defeat them, we must rely on mental power. Only when I saw that your mental power had great potential did I choose you to assist us.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Cao and said, \"So, you mean you and Tianxiang don't need to switch bodies at all?\"\n\nCao smiled slightly and said, \"You are very intelligent. This is the crux of the matter. I told you, Tianxiang and I have progressed further than those three. Although our souls and bodies are not yet fully fused, we are no longer considered human. On the surface, the difference between us and them is not significant, but in reality, our origin is that of energy bodies. These human bodies are merely condensed from various elements by us, and can be changed at any time. Otherwise, how could the coexistence of life and death for Tianxiang and I be possible? Our souls are very special, allowing energy to be maintained and transformed at any time. Therefore, we simply don't have the problems they face. All these years, we have remained the original Emotion Gods.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred, and he smiled, \"Then your current appearance must not be your original appearance. I'd like to see what you originally looked like. Is it like Tianxiang?\"\n\nCao nodded gently and said, \"The appearance Tianxiang showed you is our true appearance, just with slight differences. What she showed you was only the face, not combined with our own auras. Otherwise, the true Emotion Gods should look the same as ordinary humans, without any life aura or death aura. Although the reality is that we cannot fuse these two energies, we can achieve it on the surface. Don't forget, we are perfect.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Tianxiang's appearance is indeed the most beautiful I've ever seen. I can hardly imagine that the Creator could produce such a divinely gifted beauty!\"\n\nCao sighed and said, \"What's this? These are just bodies formed from perfect genes, not naturally created. Well, I don't want to talk about this anymore. I've eaten the food you made, and now it's time to restore your abilities.\" As she said this, she was about to turn and float towards the small lake.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" Nian Bing suddenly called out to Cao.\n\nCao was startled and looked back at Nian Bing, saying, \"Is there anything else?\"\n\nNian Bing called out to Cao because he suddenly felt that Cao and Tianxiang were very pitiful. The smile on his face became even gentler, \"Cao, after you help me restore my vitality, I will definitely stay and refine more Hundred Flower Dew for you before I leave. Although I haven't truly tasted Hundred Flower Dew, according to my master, the taste of Hundred Flower Dew is the most wondrous, with each drop having a different flavor. After I leave, if you and Tianxiang drink just one drop of Hundred Flower Dew daily, I believe you won't miss my cooking too much. This is the only thing I can do for you.\"\n\nCao looked at Nian Bing and said, \"Aren't you eager to go back and see your family and friends? Aren't you afraid of wasting time?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"My life was given to me by you. What does wasting a little time matter?\"\n\nCao smiled. It was a smile from the bottom of her heart. \"Good, we are truly friends now. It feels so good to have friends. If it weren't for our auras being completely opposite and inherently restraining each other, after living together for so many years, perhaps we could have become good friends too.\" She waved her green sleeve, and Nian Bing felt his whole body lighten, enveloped by the energy from Cao. A bridge of green energy appeared in the small lake full of life aura. Cao brought Nian Bing directly onto the bridge and floated towards the center of the lake.\n\nUpon arriving above this Lake of Life, the feeling was distinctly different. The surging life force around continuously stimulated Nian Bing's protective mental power. He was horrified to discover that his mental energy consumption was more than three times what it was before. The dense life aura continuously stimulated his spiritual world, causing him to feel slightly dizzy.\n\nCao brought Nian Bing all the way to the center of the Lake of Life before stopping. Turning to Nian Bing, her expression became serious. \"This Lake of Life, along with the Lake of Death you saw at Tianxiang's place, are the two most peculiar locations on this Divine Continent, condensing the purest life and death auras on the continent respectively. These two pure auras are not of great use to Tianxiang and me. The reason we have been guarding these two energies is to find someone to help us. Your body has been thoroughly cleansed by death aura. Originally, it was an extremely difficult process, but you were already a zombie body then, coupled with your firm will and powerful mental strength, you actually passed that hurdle with ease. In a moment, I will let you enter the spring of life. Because your body has been completely transformed by death aura, the pain you will endure here will be twice as great as at the Death God's Waterfall. Do not resist the baptism of life energy. What you need to do is to open your body and mind, let the purest life force cleanse everything within you. Guard your soul with your mental power, otherwise, even if you are resurrected, you will lose all perception and become an idiot. I will guard you from the shadows, but it will primarily depend on yourself. Do you understand? This is the final hurdle. As long as you can pass it, then, a bright future lies before you. From then on, your cultivation will become much easier than anyone else's, and one day, you will be able to reach our level, or even surpass our level.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Having come this far, how could I possibly regret it? From the moment I left the Yangguang Continent, my mental power has been constantly tested. As my mental power and will gradually strengthened, my self-confidence grew day by day, confidence derived from my own strength. After enduring the suffering in the Death God's Waterfall, my mindset has gradually changed. Every time I endured pain, it brought about an improvement in strength. Now, I actually feel a sense of anticipation.\"\n\nCao nodded approvingly. The depths of her large eyes began to change, with a green light appearing. It was definitely not any negative aura, but the purest life. At this moment, in Nian Bing's eyes, Cao was almost the embodiment of purity. Her almost infinite life aura surged upwards, and the bridge of life beneath her feet disappeared. A circle of life energy enveloped Nian Bing's body. The large tree in the center of the lake slowly shifted under the influence of the life energy. The calm, jade-like lake water began to change. The slight ripples on the surface gradually turned violent. Where the giant tree was originally located, a green vortex appeared, and the life aura shot out in an almost columnar fashion. The green light shot straight into the sky.\n\nCao's eyes shone brightly, and she softly exclaimed, \"Go.\" With a flash of light, Nian Bing's body was thrown into the vortex. Green lightning continuously flashed around Cao's body, and layers of green light rose from the Lake of Life, converging towards the vortex. The vortex's rotation gradually intensified. The shifting large tree seemed to be pulled by the vortex and gradually returned to its original position. When it completely covered the vortex, the jade-like lake surface became calm again. However, deep within the lake, in the spring of life, profound changes had occurred. Circles of green halos continuously condensed in the lake water towards the central spring. Around the base of the tree, a layer of grayish mist was dispersed.\n\nCao looked at the giant tree in front of her and muttered to herself, \"Have I asked too much of him?\"\n\nA black figure floated elegantly from behind her, and a soft, charming voice sounded, \"No, we are doing this for his own good. Only by enduring more through his own strength can he better accept the auras of life and death. Cao, I didn't expect Nian Bing to be so clever to realize that death and life can merge under certain circumstances. Although this is not entirely correct, it's close, isn't it?\" It was Tianxiang who spoke. Although her body was in an ethereal state and the death aura was not outwardly revealed, she had genuinely appeared beside Cao.\n\nUpon hearing Tianxiang's voice, Cao's demeanor immediately became much colder. \"How many chances do you think we have of succeeding?\"\n\nTianxiang shook her head and said, \"Thirty percent, at most. But this is the only feasible method we've come up with over the years.\"\n\nCao gave a self-mocking laugh. \"Nian Bing considers us friends, yet we are using him. If he knew this fact, I wonder what he would think. Yes! Life and death can merge under certain circumstances. We both truly know our common ground, but we have concealed this most crucial point from Nian Bing.\"\n\nTianxiang was silent for a moment, then said with some emotion, \"There's nothing we can do about it. This is the only common ground we can utilize. Don't worry, we won't use this until the last moment, after all, it is inherently very dangerous. If successful, we will become the strongest beings in the world with eighteen ranks. However, if we fail, then it will not be just him who is destroyed. That day will not come soon. We have given him life again, so this can be considered his contribution.\"\n\nCao sighed and said, \"The God of Order and the others are not good people, and what about us? As the Emotion Gods with the greatest emotional fluctuations, what are we? We are also just using others despicably.\"",

    "content": "Tian Xiang's voice grew much colder. \"Are you blaming me? Don't forget, these are all choices you made, or rather, that we made together. If you feel guilty, you can give up. We've spent so many years preparing these abundant energies of life and death, consolidating them to finally cultivate a single Nian Bing. This opportunity will not come again.\"\n\nKao's expression didn't change despite Tian Xiang's icy tone. He said calmly, \"Everything will pass. I just wish to always be able to eat the food Nian Bing makes. The human world is so wonderful. Fifty thousand years... I truly want to live a good life.\"\n\nTian Xiang softened. \"Don't you think I want that too? But as long as those three fellows exist, this can only be a dream. Nian Bing will be our final move. If some miracle occurs, perhaps this move will be one we never have to use. You've already told him too much today. He's a smart person. I don't want there to be a next time. Otherwise, if he guesses anything, all our plans will be in vain, and our future life will be gone.\"\n\nThe ordinary-looking Kao met the frigidly beautiful Tian Xiang's gaze. Both saw a trace of melancholy in each other's eyes, burying that peculiar feeling deep in their hearts. Shadows flickered, rejoining the life body, and the energy fluctuations in the Lake of Life became even more intense. Kao flashed, drifting into the Lake of Life.\n\n...\n\nA dark space gradually brightened. Everything around seemed to be still. No scenery in this static space would fluctuate, not even the smallest element. Everything maintained its original form without any change.\n\nA rugged voice echoed in the still space. \"Order? Are you injured?\"\n\n\"Destruction, I'm not seriously injured, but their progress is greater than we imagined, and they aren't easy to deal with. However, one thing I can be sure of is that they haven't used the method of soul possession to change bodies.\" This voice was stable; it was the God of Order, Oudi, but his tone was no longer as humble as before.\n\nA third voice chimed in, carrying a hint of feminine softness. \"Order, Kao and Tian Xiang have been fighting us for so many years. If they were easy to deal with, we would have won long ago. Although they are only half-finished products, we have to admit that in terms of grade, they are superior to us. Your aura is a bit chaotic, but it's not because of your injuries, is it?\"\n\nThe God of Order said calmly, \"Yes, I encountered a human at Kao's place, a human who seemed to be very close to her. This human's mental power is not weak. Moreover, from the aura on him, I can judge that he does not belong to the Divine Continent.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Surprise came from both the rugged and soft voices simultaneously.\n\nThe God of Time said, \"Not weak mental power? Could this be Kao and the others' secret weapon against us?\"\n\nThe rugged voice, representing the God of Destruction, asked, \"Then why didn't you just eliminate that human? Could it be that with your power, you can't kill Kao but can't kill a human?\"\n\nThe God of Order said calmly, \"I made a move. Although Kao reacted quickly, I felt that the human was unusual from the start, so I stayed very close to him. However, this human's mental power could actually block my energy for a moment, causing me to be unable to unleash my full power in my haste. Moreover, he had seven weapons that could threaten us attacking simultaneously. Although I repelled them once, I no longer had the chance for a second attack.\"\n\nThe God of Time stated, \"When Order attacks, no one survives. What are your chances of success this time?\"\n\nThe God of Order replied, \"Seventy percent. Only seventy percent. Although that human's mental power is very strong, his physical ability is very weak. His magic intensity can only be comparable to a demigod. Even though my abilities weren't fully unleashed, I have a seventy percent chance of killing him.\"\n\nThe God of Destruction exclaimed, \"Then what are you worried about? It's not easy to find a human who meets the wishes of Kao and that woman, Tian Xiang. Since he is already dead, it proves our judgment is correct. The sudden disappearance of the death aura from Tian Xiang's side was to cultivate a helper. Your timing is just right.\"\n\nThe God of Order countered, \"But I don't think it's that simple. This human does indeed possess Tian Xiang's pure death energy, but his mental power is completely disproportionate to his physical ability. This situation is very rare among humans. His Heavenly Eye acupoint has been opened to the ultimate realm. Apart from the five of us true gods, this is the first time I've seen a human open their Heavenly Eye acupoint to such a degree. Moreover, he is very young. I judge that his mental power should have innate advantages. And it's possible for him to achieve this by cultivating from a young age and under special circumstances.\"\n\n\"The ultimate Heavenly Eye acupoint? This is indeed something no deity on our Divine Continent can achieve. Let me think... Hmm, on the Yangguang Continent, there seems to be a type of person who is born with much stronger mental power than normal people.\" The God of Time's voice became more intrigued.\n\nThe God of Order added, \"I also thought of that. You must be referring to those white people. However, white people cannot cultivate magic, but that human possesses seven types of magic, which makes me feel very strange. With such strong mental power as a foundation, if Kao and Tian Xiang wholeheartedly guided him, perhaps in the near future, he could cause us a lot of trouble, or even find a group of such people. You all know that mental power is our weaker aspect. We absolutely cannot allow this possibility to arise.\"\n\nThe God of Time said coldly, \"It seems we need to have those deities do something.\"\n\nThe God of Destruction mused, \"I really want to go on a killing spree myself.\"\n\nThe God of Order declared, \"Cut off all possible opportunities for them. Next time, it will be their death knell.\"\n\n...\n\nNian Bing was currently in unprecedented pain. As soon as he entered the Lake of Life, he received Kao's notification to retract his mental power, protecting only the Heavenly Eye acupoint and leaving his body completely exposed.\n\nSuch dense life aura is actually condensed from the purest innate energy. This innate energy that nurtures life is something every cultivator dreams of. However, when applied to Nian Bing, this most precious thing turned into the most potent poison. His body had already absorbed the purest death energy from the Lake of Death, and now it encountered the opposite extreme. Life and death, being diametrically opposed, pushed him to the brink of collapse almost the instant he retracted his mental power.\n\nUnder the influence of the vast mental energy, all of Nian Bing's nerves became a hundred times more sensitive than before. He could clearly feel the dense life aura, as soon as it entered his body, began to destroy without restraint.\n\nAlthough the levels of life and death energies were high, their encounter was no different from the collision of ice and fire, only the sensation was more profound. He had experienced similar pain when cultivating the Ice and Fire Elemental magic, but this time, the pain was on an entirely different level. The hundred-fold increase in sensitivity alone almost made Nian Bing's spirit collapse.\n\nThe physical pain continuously tore at Nian Bing's nerves. He could clearly see the situation within his body. His magic power was not affected at first. The first to have problems was the surface of his resilient body, like a dragon's—his skin.\n\nUnder the stimulus of the faint green light, the skin gradually began to have issues. Since leaving the Lake of Death, Nian Bing had believed that his body's toughness had reached a certain level. Although his mental power and the Seven Magic Blades played important roles in his escape from the God of Order today, his resilient physique was also the key to his recovery after his Qi and blood flowed backward. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been just a minor injury. The God of Order's estimation wouldn't have been so high.\n\nThe skin did not immediately rupture under the effect of the Water of Life. A constant stream of changing sensations followed. Nian Bing felt as if he were savoring the ice and fire cuisine he had made; every moment's sensation was different. Sometimes it was extreme pain, sometimes deep itching, but apart from the numbness he most desired, all sorts of pain continuously appeared on his skin, transmitting through his nerves into his spiritual world. Even with his strong mental power, he couldn't make this strange body of his lose sensation.\n\nNian Bing gritted his teeth and endured. Although his sustaining belief wavered for a moment, it quickly recovered. After all, although the pain he had experienced before was not as intense as this, his nerves had already been trained to a certain extent. He kept thinking that after so much hardship, he finally had this chance to recover, so how could he give up? To return to the Yangguang Continent, to see his parents, his lover, and his friends again, he absolutely could not give up.\n\nPerhaps because his body had become abnormally sensitive, Nian Bing clearly felt the changes in every part of his body. Under the continuous erosion of the green light spots, his skin gradually softened, becoming elastic, completely supple, gently rippling with the water waves.\n\nSuddenly, the physical pain doubled without warning. Nian Bing trembled violently, and his entire body underwent deeper changes amidst continuous convulsions. The green light spots representing life energy paused for a moment, then chose suitable positions, leaving Nian Bing no room, and simultaneously seeped into his 36 million pores.\n\nThe softened skin was completely unable to stop such an invasion. The unprecedented pain almost tore his soul apart. At the critical moment, Nian Bing desperately gathered his mental power, firmly guarding the Heavenly Eye acupoint and a trace of clarity, preventing himself from collapsing due to the intense pain. He was enduring, watching those green energies enter his body and begin a fierce battle with the death energy.\n\nThe pure death aura had merely merged with Nian Bing's body and was not yet utilized by him. Suddenly encountering such a strong and diametrically opposite energy impact, it naturally fought back. Gray energy spots continuously emerged from his meridians and blood, entangling with the green light spots, attacking each other without yielding. Here, every convulsion of Nian Bing's body would release a stream of gray airflow, which was not simple innate energy, but his blood that had turned gray! Every time gray blood gushed out and merged with the green life energy, Nian Bing felt pain as if a thousand ants were gnawing at his heart. His body convulsed violently, out of control. He even wished for immediate death. He had told Kao before that everyone's happiness was different at different times, and the greatest happiness he could think of now was death.\n\nWithout truly experiencing it, one would never understand that there are things more painful than death, and Nian Bing was truly experiencing it now. The death energy and life energy disregarded whether his body could adapt, both desperately destroying and attacking each other. And Nian Bing's body was their battlefield.\n\nThe battlefield gradually became devastated amidst a fierce battle. Nian Bing watched as his resilient meridians were shattered by the passage of the two energies, watched as his bones developed numerous fine holes. His body was gradually collapsing, his skin surface had already started to fester. Gray blood formed an energy circle around his body, constantly trembling and rippling. Let alone controlling his body, even if he had truly decided to die, he couldn't do it.\n\nThe strength of the death energy and life energy was equal, and neither could do anything to the other for a while. Just as Nian Bing thought his physical body was about to be destroyed and he would truly leave this world, a familiar coolness suddenly came from his mouth. His will instantly strengthened because he knew that although he couldn't speak or see, he could feel that what entered his mouth was the Tian Xiang Fruit he had eaten once before! This immediately made him feel as if he had entered paradise. A gentle energy drilled between every life element and death element, forming a subtle yet effective barrier, isolating them. The pain almost disappeared in an instant.\n\nA long groan escaped Nian Bing's lips. In the unparalleled pain, he had long forgotten that he was still in the lake. The moment he opened his mouth, he swallowed a large mouthful of the Water of Life. As if igniting the fuse of an explosive, the previous gentle energy surprisingly surged into the gaps between the life energy and the death energy respectively. Their war reappeared, but this time, the pain it brought Nian Bing was double that of before.",

    "content": "A gentle palm pressed against Nian Bing's back.\n\nA mild life aura was injected into his body from his back. All life energy seemed to have found its place. Under the effect of this life aura, it launched a fierce attack against the death aura.\n\nThe death aura, facing the opponent's tide-like attack, finally receded. The gray and green, two completely opposite energies, gradually separated. The gray was inside, and the green was outside. They stood in clear opposition.\n\nEvery step the green aura advanced was much more difficult than the previous one. The death energy was incomparably tenacious. They were defending their territory, while the life aura constantly attacked them. Both life energies were the purest energies in the world, and also the highest-level energies. Neither could destroy the other, only continuously squeeze each other, hoping to expel the opponent.\n\nDue to the addition of the latter life energy, the death energy within Nian Bing's body gradually fell into a disadvantage. Under constant squeezing and tearing, it retreated step by step, ceding a small portion of its territory. In the areas where the death aura was lost, Nian Bing's body was immediately occupied by the life aura. Thus, the life aura was no longer the root of Nian Bing's pain.\n\nThe purest green energy directly merged with Nian Bing's body. His skin recovered almost without any pause. The crystal-clear and lustrous skin, in the process of repair, gradually returned to elasticity from its ulcerated state. This time, Nian Bing's skin became like crystal. A soft green light constantly flickered beneath his skin. The life energy had won the first round.\n\nHowever, the real battle had only just begun. Before Nian Bing could feel more, the death energy launched a fierce counterattack. Because the two energies separated, Nian Bing could feel much less pain in every part of his body. But on the front line of the battle between the life energy and the death energy, the pain was even more intense than before.\n\nThe mental energy within the Heavenly Eye acupoint violently fluctuated and trembled. Seven-colored light continuously flashed, severing the connection between the mental energy and every part of the body. Even so, it could not stop the pain from transmitting into Nian Bing's consciousness, into the deepest part of his soul. Even with Nian Bing's firm spirit, it was slowly collapsing under such circumstances. The vast starry sky of seven colors had completely receded, becoming clusters of light that gathered together like a vortex. Under the external pain, like the death energy, it was also constantly compressed. The Heavenly Eye acupoint completely closed. The compressed and squeezing mental energy continuously fluctuated. Nian Bing felt that if these seven clusters of mental energy were to collapse, he would truly be finished. What was Cao doing? Why was she fanning the flames? That life aura was clearly from her, and only she possessed such power!\n\nNian Bing thought to himself. Cao, however, was exceptionally surprised. In her opinion, Nian Bing's mental energy should have collapsed as soon as the life aura rushed into his body. Such pain was unbearable. Previously, she had told Nian Bing to endure, hoping he could last a few more moments, even one moment, as it would greatly increase his benefits. However, she never expected that Nian Bing could endure the pain that even she and Tian Xiang could not bear. And he was completely conscious. This strange situation made Cao hesitate. She feared that her and Tian Xiang's efforts might cause Nian Bing's personality to become distorted due to his excessive persistence. If that happened, his mental energy would undergo unpredictable changes and become difficult to control.\n\nUnfortunately, at this point, although Cao could control the situation of Nian Bing's body, she had no spare hands to control Nian Bing's mental energy. She had tried before, but Nian Bing's mental energy was compressed extremely tightly due to the pain acting as an attacker. Even her mental energy could not penetrate it to make Nian Bing give up. At this moment, all she could do was to complete what she was doing as quickly as possible.\n\nThe life energy instantly increased, and the speed at which the death energy retreated became even faster. As long as the life energy occupied a portion of territory, it would immediately use its vast life force to repair that area. In this way, Nian Bing's body was essentially being reborn from the outside in. And his mental energy, due to excessive concentration, not only did not feel like fainting but became increasingly clear-headed.\n\nThe Heavenly Eye acupoint gradually changed. Not only was the energy within compressed, but even the vast space of the Heavenly Eye acupoint was affected by the pain and fluctuated violently. At this moment, the mental energy had abandoned its outer defenses. The death energy and life energy naturally would not let go of this battlefield. They began to fight within Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye acupoint.\n\nThe pain reached an unprecedented peak as the death energy was gradually compressed. Suddenly, Nian Bing felt something in his brain shatter. While startled, he discovered with shock that it was not his mental energy that had shattered. The seven clusters of starlight had been squeezed into a seven-colored ball of light. This ball of light would not emit light but was a completely solid ball of light. The center was a two-colored light of red and blue, surrounded by five colors. Nian Bing did not know what had happened to his mental energy, but he found that his perception was instantly liberated. He could not only see everything happening within his body but also everything outside. His perception rapidly spread, reaching every corner of the life domain. He was shocked to find that the plants in the life domain were gradually withering, their appearance clearly indicating a loss of life force! Was all this because of him? Yes, it must have been.\n\nThe Life Lake, originally jade-like green, was covered with a layer of hazy aura. Circles of green halos continuously surged towards his body. And Cao was behind him. At this moment, she was completely nude. Not a shred of clothing covered her. What shocked Nian Bing even more was that Cao had completely transformed into Tian Xiang's appearance. If not for her eyes filled with green and her vast life force, Nian Bing would have thought she was Tian Xiang.\n\nWhat a perfect body! Her bare skin emitted an alluring glow. Her proud and elastic breasts were only a foot away from his back. Cao's arms were bare, and her fair long legs were pressed against his back. It was only then that Nian Bing realized that not only was Cao bare, but his body was also bare. His crystal-clear skin was almost as good as Cao's, only slightly darker in color, showing a healthy bronze hue. However, the surface of his skin seemed to have a crystal-like substance. The life energy surged wildly, transforming his body.\n\nSuddenly seeing Cao's naked body, Nian Bing felt that his pain seemed to have lessened slightly, perhaps due to distraction. Upon noticing this phenomenon, he immediately focused his attention and brazenly observed Cao. Cao's body had the same structure as an ordinary woman's, but her body was too perfect. Although Nian Bing had only seen Lan Chen's delicate body before, he had never observed it so carefully. Out of a man's nature, he couldn't help but think, if he could hold Cao in his arms, like he did with Chen Chen last time... how wonderful that would be! His heart grew hot, and he forgot to search for the source of the shattering sound. He no longer looked at his own body, just quietly looking at Cao, thinking the most common lewd thoughts of a man. If Cao knew at this moment that Nian Bing could see her and was still thinking such vulgar thoughts, she might kill him immediately.\n\nNian Bing didn't know how much time had passed. After carefully observing every part of Cao's body from head to toe, he gradually came back to his senses. The pain still existed, but it was clearly not as unbearable as before. The core of his seven-colored mental energy ball was his soul. Nian Bing suddenly felt that this bead was the hardest thing in the world, and nothing could destroy it.\n\nAs the pain lessened, Nian Bing relaxed a bit. Only then did he bother to observe his own body. He was surprised to find that the changes in his body were very small. Compared to before, the death energy was only compressed in the chest and abdomen, losing more territory. His limbs had been completely occupied by the life aura. The familiar red blood and white bones reappeared. The death energy, being compressed, was retreating step by step, and the direction of retreat was towards the magic power in his chest and abdomen.\n\nNian Bing thought to himself, \"No way. If the magic power, which I finally recovered, is completely eroded by the death aura, what will my magic be like in the future? Cao, what exactly do you want to do?\"\n\nAs Nian Bing pondered, the magic power within his body had already begun to change. Since recovering his magic in the Death Lake, Nian Bing had regenerated seven magic orbs in his chest and abdomen. Each magic orb was more solid than before. Although the magic energy was still about the same as before, it was easier to control, and the absorption of magic elements from the air was not much slower than before, with the joint action of his mental energy.\n\nNow, under the gradual pressure of the surrounding death energy, these seven magic energy orbs gradually stopped rotating and began to converge towards the center. The originating-from-the-same-source ice and fire magic orbs seemed to be resisting something. The seven kinds of magic light emitted layers of faint radiance, resisting the death energy like the death energy resisting the life energy.\n\nUnfortunately, how could Nian Bing's magic power compare to those two purest energies? In just a moment, the seven magic orbs shattered one by one. The magic energy turned into a liquid state, and under the contamination of the death energy, it gradually merged into the gray energy.\n\nNian Bing couldn't help but feel like crying without tears. After cultivating for so many years, he had finally achieved his current success, but his magic disappeared at this moment. Even if he could be resurrected, without magic, relying only on mental energy, would he become a white-haired psychic magician? That was not what he wanted to see.\n\nThe attack of the life energy became more ferocious. The green light points had compressed the death energy from gray to grayish-black, and it was still shrinking inwards. Nian Bing sighed and thought, \"Forget it. Since it's like this, what else can I do? Since I can't change this fact, I can only accept it. Anyway, Cao and the others still need my help, so there must be a way to help me recover my magic power.\" Thinking of this, his mood eased a little, and he stopped looking around, retracting his perception to near his mental energy. Upon retracting it, Nian Bing discovered a problem.\n\nThe original Heavenly Eye acupoint had undergone a tremendous change. The seven-colored energy ball was still in the center of the Heavenly Eye acupoint, but the current Heavenly Eye acupoint was only slightly larger than the seven-colored energy ball. Moreover, around this seven-colored mental energy ball, it was completely covered by a layer of golden light. This faint golden light was an energy that Nian Bing had never felt before. It was an energy filled with a domineering aura. And his mental energy was not affected by this energy, but instead communicated with it continuously. Under the influence of that domineering aura, Nian Bing clearly felt that his originally somewhat mixed mental energy was undergoing a process of purification.\n\nThe color of the mental energy ball did not change, but as the energy gradually purified, all the perceptional abilities influenced by his mental energy were enhanced. Nian Bing was shocked to discover that his mental energy was naturally flowing into his meridians, and he could control the retreating death energy.\n\nWhat was going on? Wasn't his Heavenly Eye acupoint already at the ultimate realm? Although it was somewhat special due to the influence of magic back then, the ultimate Heavenly Eye acupoint should not have undergone such significant changes! But what was he seeing now? Had the Heavenly Eye acupoint evolved again? Impossible. Theoretically, the Seven Aperture Acupoints would only reach the ultimate realm, and then it would be just a deepening of energy. As Cao had said, the human body itself had limits and could not endlessly progress, but the facts were right before his eyes. What should he do?\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel puzzled. He didn't know what to do. Therefore, he had a bold idea.\n\nHis perception surged from within his body once more. This time, his senses were even clearer, as if everything around him was under his control. He accurately guided his perception to Cao's side and once again greedily savored that perfect pride. Forcing himself to suppress the urge to look at the mysterious area below again, he gently touched Cao's consciousness with his perception and sent out a call to her.\n\n\"Cao,\"\n\n\"Cao,\"\n\n\"Can you hear my voice?\"\n\nThe next chapter will be very exciting.\n\nHey, I believe those who read this chapter can guess something. For tomorrow's excitement, please vote more for Xiao San.",

    "content": "The fluctuations of life energy within Nen Bing suddenly intensified, causing a slight pause in the flow of life energy into his body. This momentary lapse allowed the energy of death to counterattack and reclaim a small portion of territory.\n\nKao's voice, filled with disbelief, echoed in Nen Bing's mind: \"You can call out to me? You can still call me at this time? No, this is absolutely impossible!\"\n\nNen Bing replied with a hint of helplessness, \"I also find this unlikely, but the facts are before us, and I have indeed accomplished it. What exactly are you trying to do by sending life energy into my body? My magical power has already been dissolved. My mental power seems to have undergone some changes, allowing me to control the death energy. What should I do now to help you?\"\n\nKao fell silent. The life energy stopped its internal attack and halted, maintaining the existing territory. After a long pause, Kao's voice resonated again, \"Nen Bing, you truly are a monster.\"\n\nNen Bing blinked, finding it somewhat amusing. \"To be praised so highly by you, a True God, is truly my honor!\"\n\nKao sighed softly. \"I don't know what changes have occurred within you, but if you can control the death energy now, immediately gather it. Have my mental power occupy more territory. What I need to do is force the pure death energy within your body together, compress it, and confine it to the Lid Zhong acupoint in your chest. This way, the aura of death can be stored there, becoming the most densely compressed energy. Your body has just been filled with my life energy, achieving true rebirth. Don't worry about your magical power; it hasn't disappeared, it's simply been dispersed within your body. As long as my life force occupies your body, I can restore it completely. With such immense life energy as a backup, and with your Heavenly Eye acupoint already opened, I believe it won't be long before the seven major acupoints within your body are opened one by one. This will greatly benefit the improvement of your strength.\"\n\n\"Good. I understand what you mean. I'll start gathering the death energy now. The final point of condensation is the Lid Zhong acupoint, correct? However, I'm afraid my mental power won't be enough to contain the compressed death energy. Limiting it seems quite difficult.\"\n\nKao replied, \"It's alright. Acupoints inherently have the function of restricting energy. As long as you compress it and gather it into the Lid Zhong acupoint, I have absolute confidence that it won't counterattack again. As for what help these death energies and life energies can bring you in the future, it will depend on your own efforts. Tian Xiang and I are also taking a gamble. We are creating another God of Emotion.\n\nHowever, you do not possess our genes. Therefore, you can only rely on your own abilities to explore the relationship between these two energies. If, one day, you can integrate them, just as you integrated the origin of ice and fire, that would be the greatest help to us. Alas, the body of a God of Emotion without the soul and power of a God of Emotion... even I don't know if this is the right course of action.\n\nBut one thing I can be certain of is that after this, you will become the most potential raw jade. Your cultivation speed in the future will likely surprise even us. You have already surprised me. Rest assured, I will handle the final condensation, and there will be no adverse effects. Proceed with confidence, and let's begin now.\"\n\nNen Bing agreed. With a slight movement of his mental power, the death energy was already under his control. Under the influence of his thoughts, he clearly felt the death energy behaving like a mass of water, making it incredibly difficult to compress. His mental power surged instantly, isolating the life energy from the death energy. Suddenly, all the pain vanished once more. Nen Bing, overjoyed, immediately began controlling the death energy to shrink.\n\nEven Nen Bing himself hadn't expected his mental power to be this strong. The death energy, which had seemed so difficult to handle, was directly compressed to half its previous volume under the effect of his mental power. A significant amount of life force surged into his chest and abdomen, first repairing his heart. The surging life force connected to his brain and heart, and the feeling of being alive again finally emerged. What a wonderful feeling that was! Sensing this, Nen Bing immediately accelerated his control over the death energy, desperately compressing it towards his chest.\n\nWith the external assault of the immense life force and the internal control of Nen Bing's transformed mental power, the pure death energy could no longer cause trouble. With no ability to counterattack, it could only shrink inwards bit by bit. Nen Bing clearly felt that with every inch of inward compression, the resistance he encountered increased, yet his mental power, like a tangible substance, forcibly contained and controlled it. After all, this death energy was a part of his body and was always subject to its limitations. If the energy were external, it would be beyond Nen Bing's control.\n\nAs the death energy continued to compress, Kao suddenly shifted her position, moving from behind Nen Bing to the front. Her hand, which had been on his back, now pressed against his chest. The immense life energy flowed directly from her Lid Zhong acupoint, not as a direct assault, but transforming into a net of life, enveloping the death energy Nen Bing was containing.\n\nIf Kao had undertaken this entire process herself, it would have taken much longer. However, with Nen Bing's assistance, the condensation process was significantly reduced. The life energy from the Lake of Life nourished Nen Bing's body, while Kao fully utilized her life energy, entering Nen Bing's Lid Zhong acupoint. Not only did she encircle the death energy, but she also pulled at it. During this pulling process, in coordination with Nen Bing's control, the compression became even easier.\n\nKao's current actions were equivalent to teaming up with Nen Bing against Tian Xiang. In terms of overall energy, they were clearly stronger than Tian Xiang. However, as the death energy was compressed to a certain extent, its density greatly increased, making further compression extremely difficult. The compressed death energy had turned black and reached a state of near saturation. Even with Nen Bing's full effort, the energy Kao input through her palm was insufficient to further compress the sphere of death energy. Yet, to enter the Lid Zhong acupoint, its volume needed to be reduced by another two times.\n\nA stalemate ensued. Kao tried several methods of altering the energy flow without success. The death energy within Nen Bing had become extremely resilient due to compression. This was her first attempt at helping a human undergo such a transformation, and all the previous considerations seemed to be mere ideas. Encountering such trouble in practice left her somewhat at a loss.\n\nNen Bing was also containing the death energy. His sensations were far stronger than Kao's. His body was filled with surging life energy. He had never felt so truly alive as he did at this moment. The feeling of survival was so wonderful. The surging life energy continuously impacted his body, and his thoughts extended outward.\n\nHe clearly saw the life field, originally full of vitality, gradually changing. The vibrant plants, while not withering, had lost their intense life aura. The most significant change was in the Lake of Life. The clear lake water gradually became somewhat turbid. The outer edge of the Lake of Life had lost its life aura, as the vast amount of life energy was continuously injected into his body. Just as Kao had said, within this surging life energy, his previously lost magical power was re-condensing. Moreover, its condensation level was higher than before, and its volume had also increased. He couldn't help but want to shout, \"I'm alive again, I've truly come back to life!\"\n\nKao communicated with the other soul, Tian Xiang, within her body and made a bold choice. Just as Nen Bing's body recovered all sensation, and he was filled with excitement, Tian Xiang suddenly withdrew her hand from his chest. Amidst the rippling water, her perfect goddess-like form gracefully moved forward. Parting the water, her intertwined legs wrapped around Nen Bing's waist and back, attaching completely to his strong body.\n\nColdness was Nen Bing's first sensation. For an instant, his mind went blank as he processed the coldness against him. Immediately after, his body underwent a dramatic change, becoming intensely hot in direct contrast to that coldness.\n\nEven Nen Bing himself hadn't expected such a fierce reaction. In reality, this phenomenon wasn't due to Nen Bing's craving for physical intimacy. He had just recovered a vast amount of life force. Such surging life energy naturally awakened the most primal desire within him. Moreover, Kao's body was the embodiment of natural beauty, and her perfect physique was irresistible to any man.\n\nA thunderous roar echoed in his mind. Countless surges of life energy poured in from the point where their bodies connected. Her cool, smooth skin made contact with Nen Bing's burning skin. With his senses amplified a hundredfold, Nen Bing felt his blood boiling, as if it would burst out of his body. A man's natural reaction manifested, pressing against Kao's lower abdomen. Having just regained the ability to move, he instinctively embraced Kao, holding her body tightly against him. If not for a sliver of clarity remaining in his mind, he would have already broken through.\n\nKao embraced Nen Bing, her body making seamless contact with his, so that she could exert her life energy to its fullest and transfer it completely into Nen Bing's body, aiding in the final compression of the death energy. However, despite living for fifty thousand years, this was the first time in her life she had experienced such intimacy with a man.\n\nAs she embraced Nen Bing, she felt as if she were holding a giant furnace. An unprecedented, strange sensation instantly spread throughout her body. She clearly felt her life energy surging as if stimulated. Her clear consciousness momentarily fell into a daze, especially the burning object pressing against her lower abdomen, which sent her heart into disarray. For a moment, she forgot her purpose in holding Nen Bing, and as she experienced that peculiar sensation, her body grew even colder. The surrounding water waves rippled, continuously impacting their bodies. In this marvelous sensation, their souls gradually harmonized, their heartbeats quickened, and the life energy no longer flowed solely from Kao's body into Nen Bing's but also emanated from Nen Bing's body, creating a wondrous circulation between them. Under the effect of the suddenly surging life energy, the death energy gradually contracted, no longer able to resist.\n\nThe physical desire grew increasingly intense. The amplified senses stimulated Nen Bing's primal reactions. This intense stimulation was even harder to bear than the violent pain he had previously experienced. Yet, even though he knew where the release was, he restrained himself. He wanted to use his thoughts of Feng Nü, Ling'er, and Lan Chen to suppress his desire, but under these circumstances, how could he possibly succeed? At this moment, his mind was filled only with Kao, whom he had observed carefully. His hands, embracing her delicate body, moved up and down involuntarily. His left hand slowly slid to the curve of Kao's elegant, full buttocks, and he subconsciously drew her lower body closer to him. Only her cold body could somewhat diminish his longing.\n\nNo, I can't. Nen Bing's body was no longer coordinated with his will. Although his mind continuously tried to stop him, his body, about to explode, was becoming increasingly unbearable. Especially when his hand caressed her exquisitely shaped buttocks, his desire instantly soared to its peak. Kao's body was gently lifted in the water by him, and his lower body's erection gradually moved forward, lightly touching that mysterious triangle.\n\nAs a powerful True God, Kao was trembling slightly. Her life energy was fully stimulated by this peculiar sensation. She clearly felt stronger than ever before, and the man embracing her was so handsome, so perfect. Kao's heart gradually softened. She had forgotten her plan and what she was supposed to do. Her slender, rounded, and elastic beautiful legs slowly parted, and her hands, which had been around Nen Bing's lower back, slowly rose, embracing his neck.\n\nIn the water, their eyes opened almost simultaneously. Her soft, full breasts pressed against Nen Bing's firm chest. Her emerald green eyes met Nen Bing's, which had returned to a deep blue. Life energy became the bridge between them.\n\nKao's beauty was breathtakingly sacred. Nen Bing could no longer suppress the desire in his heart. He lowered his head, parting the water, and gently pressed his lips onto her soft, red lips. The contrasting energies of Nen Bing and heat flowed into each other, and comfortable moans echoed in their hearts simultaneously. Gently parting her soft lips, Nen Bing found her smooth, fragrant tongue and began to suckle it greedily. One of his hands held Kao's waist, while the other grasped her fair, perfect, full buttocks.",

    "content": "Ka'ao, initially hesitant, became increasingly passionate. The most primal expression of life transported her to an incredibly beautiful realm. Her slender legs slowly ascended his, wrapping around his waist, liberating his previously obstructed erection. As the hot, firm erection gently brushed against her most tender part, Ka'ao's heart trembled violently.\n\nNian Bing placed both hands on Ka'ao's buttocks and lifted them gently, bringing her body closer to his. He slowly moved his hands down, his erection pressing against the soft petals, inching its way inward.\n\nKa'ao let out a low moan and broke away from Nian Bing's deep kiss, tightly clutching his neck and shoulders. Her fingernails dug into his firm back muscles. She was afraid, nervous, and yet, she also yearned for him.\n\nThe soft center slowly moved downwards, a warm sensation flowing from the water and also from their joined place into the depths of their souls. With every inch forward, he encountered significant resistance. The tight, narrow sheath only intensified Nian Bing's arousal. Suddenly, he met a barrier. Having had prior experience, he knew this was Ka'ao's last defense. He forced himself to stop, his hands also trembling. His life energy fluctuated unstably and violently. He didn't know whether he should continue, but the arrow was already on the string; it was not easy to stop and think.\n\nRaising his head, Ka'ao looked at Nian Bing with complex eyes. Suddenly, she bit down on his shoulder. Nian Bing's whole body shuddered, and his hands instinctively moved down, his body following suit. Ka'ao convulsed violently, and the final barrier was finally broken. Nian Bing instantly entered the deepest part of the tight sheath, reaching the peculiar and beautiful heart of the flower.\n\nHis life energy exploded completely. Amidst the violent roar, Nian Bing's body felt an extreme pleasure. The last time he was with Lan Chen, both their spirits were enhanced by the medicinal effects. This time, with the amplified senses, his experience was so profound. The moment he broke through the barrier, his heart was also released. He tightly gripped the soft buttocks, allowing himself to merge more deeply with Ka'ao.\n\nThe green life energy burned as if on fire, pushing the resisting death energy almost instantly into the Li Zhong acupoint. His reborn body was revitalized through the complete union of life forces. A faint green light enveloped both Ka'ao and Nian Bing. Ka'ao, amidst the tearing pain in her lower body, discovered with surprise that her life energy seemed to have broken through a bottleneck she had long yearned to overcome. Nian Bing's body was greedily absorbing her life energy.\n\nThe increase in life energy brought Nian Bing's arousal to its peak. The tightness below became more comfortable with the lubrication generated by constant stimulation. Amidst the rippling water, he began to move gently. With each thrust, he was sent to the pinnacle of ecstasy. His movements transitioned from slow and gentle to powerful, each thrust firm and persistent. The increased amplitude of his movements made Nian Bing's sensations even more profound, and the feeling of ecstasy made him yearn to explore the final peak.\n\nPain constantly transmitted into Ka'ao's soul. However, as the pain intensified, waves of tingling sensations followed, especially when the tip of his erection touched her delicate flower heart, intensifying the feeling. Every push from Nian Bing caused her to convulse. She slowly loosened her grip on Nian Bing's mouth, and her beautiful moans, carried by the water, entered Nian Bing's ears.\n\nReceiving such clear encouragement, Nian Bing's movements became faster. As the rhythm quickened, his movements became larger, causing the surrounding water to ripple continuously. The life force from the Lake of Life surged into their bodies. Not only Nian Bing was nourished, but Ka'ao also benefited.\n\nNian Bing didn't know how long he had been at it. He only felt that a long time had passed. Each movement pushed the feeling of ecstasy a step further, and Ka'ao gradually began to respond to his movements. It was under these circumstances that their coordination gradually became skilled. Ka'ao's body, driven by Nian Bing, changed from cold to hot. The feeling was so wonderful, so moving. Finally, when ecstasy reached its peak, quantity turned into quality, and indescribable happiness exploded in their bodies simultaneously.\n\nThe seeds of life, as they erupted, gave Nian Bing and Ka'ao a glimmer of understanding of the source of life. Especially Ka'ao, as the Goddess of Life, her experience was much more profound than Nian Bing's. The surging life energy completely poured into both their bodies at the final moment. Ka'ao, who thought she would lose life energy by helping Nian Bing, found that not only had it not decreased, but it was even more abundant than before.\n\nThe peak of ecstasy began to wane. Nian Bing held Ka'ao tightly, savoring the afterglow of the ecstasy. Suddenly, he clearly felt the life energy within his body tremble violently and surge madly downwards, as if finding a huge outlet. Just as he was awakening from his arousal, Ka'ao abruptly raised her head, pressed her hands forcefully on his shoulders, and her delicate body shot upwards out of the lake. The place where they were joined separated, immediately creating a stream of the liquid of the source of life in the water.\n\nKa'ao shot out of the water at an angle, her perfect, delicate body floating silently in the air. Water droplets continuously slid down her body. She was surprised to find that her life domain, which should have become desolate after losing life force, had actually become vibrant again. The Lake of Life was still as emerald as before, and the ripples she had caused upon exiting the water were gradually spreading into the distance. The plants on the shore remained as they were, flowers blooming, seemingly more vibrant than before.\n\nKa'ao's body ascended, while Nian Bing's body sank to the bottom of the lake. He clearly understood why Ka'ao had left him so suddenly. If she hadn't done so, his life force would likely have been directly absorbed into her body. The feeling of being filled with life made Nian Bing feel as if he were immersed in a warm ocean. A hint of fatigue and weariness entered his brain. The relaxation of his mind and body meant he no longer needed to gather mental strength to resist.\n\nClosing his eyes, he felt the waves constantly impact him, comfortably and relaxed, he fell asleep.\n\nAfter the clash between life energy and death energy, although his body had been completely transformed, it still needed time to be nourished and repaired. The death energy in his chest had condensed into a black pearl, quietly resting in the Li Zhong acupoint, surrounded by a circle of jade-green light. His entire body flickered on and off, with seven colors of light flashing alternately. The black light in his chest and the seven colors at his brow were the most prominent, especially the seven colors surrounded by golden light, which seemed to represent the birth of a new realm.\n\nKa'ao floated in the air, gazing absently at everything around her. She remained silent for a long time. Even she didn't know why this had happened, but she had no regrets. The unprecedented experience was deeply imprinted in her memory. Her exquisitely beautiful face kept changing expressions, sometimes complaining, sometimes smiling, various emotions shifting constantly.\n\n\"Beautiful?\" A black figure quietly separated from her body. Tian Xiang, an energy form, floated beside her.\n\n\"Don't you also feel it? Why ask me?\" Ka'ao's indifferent voice held a trace of tenderness.\n\nTian Xiang smiled faintly, \"Yes! I feel it too. So, humans can create such beauty. It's a pity I'm not you. We are two souls after all. What I can feel is only one-third of what you feel. Do you know? Now I really desire to experience it again with Nian Bing when I control the body, to feel that wonderful feeling. I think you must have benefited quite a bit just now.\"\n\nKa'ao smiled faintly, \"Do you think that's important?\"\n\nTian Xiang smiled, \"Yes! Of course, it's not important. The experience and feelings you gained are the more beautiful things.\"\n\nKa'ao chuckled, \"Even I didn't expect this to happen. My life energy not only didn't decrease but increased significantly. It also made me understand the source of human vitality. Tell me, should I blame him or thank him? He's our first man!\"\n\nTian Xiang shook her head, \"No, he's just your first man, but not mine yet.\"\n\nKa'ao smiled at Tian Xiang, \"If you want him, it's not difficult. When he wakes up, I don't think he'll refuse you.\"\n\nTian Xiang looked at Ka'ao, \"He won't refuse? No, you're mistaken. Don't you realize that Nian Bing went through a fierce psychological struggle before you two merged? If it weren't for the hundredfold amplification of his senses making the stimulation in all aspects unbearable, he might not have done anything with you. I can feel that he already has a beloved in his heart. Your union is merely a physical one, not what humans call love.\"\n\nKa'ao frowned, \"Tian Xiang, you're jealous.\"\n\nTian Xiang smiled slyly, \"Perhaps. Why didn't I think of doing this with him back then? Ka'ao, have you noticed? After you two merged, our compatibility also increased slightly. Although it's only a small part, it's something we've been pursuing for years but couldn't achieve.\"\n\nKa'ao laughed, \"Do you think we should have more such relations with him? If that way, we won't hurt him, I'm willing to try.\"\n\nTian Xiang looked at Ka'ao deeply and said in a low voice, \"You've softened. He's your first man. I think you'll develop feelings for him easily. But please, don't forget our purpose. I won't do anything with him. You're already not clear-headed, I must remain clear-headed. He is our last resort. Unless we find another way, this will not change.\"\n\nKa'ao wanted to say something, but looking at Tian Xiang's determined gaze, she couldn't speak. She let out a soft sigh and her gaze fell upon the clear lake surface.\n\n\"The storm of ice and snow is my most beautiful vow.\" A beautiful voice echoed in the valley. Surrounded by ice and snow, a blue figure slowly rose. There was no trace of earthly aura; the pure ice element covered everything around. A pair of huge blue wings spread to the sides, allowing the blue figure to float silently in mid-air.\n\nTwo figures, one red and one purple, floated in the air. The purple figure was also set against the backdrop of ice and snow, while the red figure gently flapped a pair of wings that seemed to be made of fire, and in a blink of an eye, arrived in front of the blue figure.\n\nThe blue figure looked at them and sighed softly, \"A year and a half.\"\n\nThe red figure flew to her front, \"Yes! It's been a year and a half. I wonder how he is. We've been thinking of him, and he must be thinking of us too, right?\"\n\nThe purple figure's voice, filled with sadness, said, \"It's been a year and a half. I miss him so much. I wonder if he's alright?\"\n\nThree different graceful figures, Feng Nü, Long Ling, and Lan Chen. The three women looked at each other in the air. With the help of the Seven Dragon Kings, a year and a half had passed. Their growth had even surprised the Seven Dragon Kings. What supported them was always the motivation in their hearts.\n\nFeng Nü smiled and took Long Ling's slender waist, \"Sister, you can't always be sad. Didn't I tell you? We must have faith in him. For us, he will definitely come back.\"\n\nLong Ling's eyes reddened, \"Sister, you don't need to comfort me. I know your longing for him is no less than mine.\"\n\nFeng Nü glanced at Lan Chen beside her, \"Half a year ago, we should have gone to the Ice God Pagoda, but our subsequent seclusion dragged the time until now. If the three of us join forces, we have at least a 60% chance of success. Chen Chen, can you let go of everything from the past?\"\n\nLan Chen gently shook her head, \"Sister, the kindness of upbringing can never be forgotten. She is, after all, my master! I will repay her kindness, but we can't wait any longer. Let's go back and inform the Seven Dragon Kings later, and then we can leave. Perhaps, if we fulfill Nian Bing's wish, he will return.\"\n\nAfter a year and a half of waiting, the three women had all begun to despair. A year and a half, and not a single piece of news about Nian Bing had arrived. They vented all their negative emotions into their cultivation. To alleviate the pain of longing, they could only train desperately. They had asked the Seven Dragon Kings about the method to travel to the Divine Continent more than once, but they were always stopped. The last time the Dragon God took Nian Bing to the Divine Continent, it was already a great risk and consumed a lot of energy. The same thing could not be done again. Moreover, the Seven Dragon Kings had contacted the Dragon God once to inquire about Nian Bing's situation, but the Dragon King had told them that Nian Bing was still undergoing treatment and he didn't know the specific details. In the realm of the God of Life, without Ka'ao's permission, the Dragon God could not enter.",

    "content": "If not for the lack of definitive news of Nian Bing's death, the three women would have likely collapsed long ago. They were unwilling to reveal too much of their sorrow, fearing it would affect the other two, but in secret, they didn't know how many tears they had shed. Especially the simple-hearted Long Ling, whose mental fortitude was far inferior to Feng Nü and Lan Zhen. After her daily cultivation, Long Ling would almost always find a place to secretly weep, chanting Nian Bing's name.\n\nFeng Nü nodded and said, \"Alright, let's go back now.\"\n\nLong Ling suddenly looked up and said, \"Sister Feng Nü, I want to ask the Seven Dragon Kings to summon Lord Dragon God again to inquire about Nian Bing's current situation. Perhaps there's news of Nian Bing now? What if he returns and can't find us!\"\n\nFeng Nü looked at the pleading in Long Ling's eyes and gently nodded, \"Let's go back and try. Jing'er and Brother Jialamanidis should be back these past two days. It's been about a month since they returned to Ice Snow City, right?\"\n\nAlthough Xue Jing had come to the Cold Ridge with Jialamanidis, and their identities had been confirmed, she still missed her father and would occasionally return to visit Xue Ji. Long Ling also wanted to go back, but she was afraid, afraid that if she saw her father, she would never be able to return. Nian Bing had fulfilled Long Zhi's wish, and the status of the Ice Moon Empire Mage Guild in the Ice Moon Empire was now vastly different from before. Even the headquarters had been moved to Ice Snow City, and their influence had greatly increased.\n\nLong Ling nodded and said, \"We have to wait for Jing'er to return before we leave. I also asked her to inquire about my father's situation for me.\"\n\nThe three women's figures moved, slowly heading towards the Dragon King's cave, supported by the power of ice and fire.\n\nThey landed at the cave entrance and happened to meet the Ice Dragon King Salsaris. Salsaris smiled at the three women and said, \"You're back. Your cultivation has improved again. I really envy the progress humans make. If only I could be like you humans and open acupoints, my abilities wouldn't stagnate.\" For any divine dragon, once they reach the Dragon King realm, the only way to improve is by cultivating the Dragon God's Heart Sutra; otherwise, breaking through this bottleneck is extremely difficult.\n\nFeng Nü smiled slightly and said, \"But we also have to thank you, Sister, for your help!\" As the Ice Dragon King, Salsaris had been of great help to Lan Zhen and Long Ling, who cultivated ice magic.\n\nSalsaris glanced at Long Ling and smiled, \"Ling'er, thinking of your Nian Bing again, aren't you? You girl, you should cry less; it pains me to see it.\" Although her face was still frosty, this occasional smile was full of charm.\n\nSuddenly, the Ice Dragon King Salsaris's expression changed. \"Not good, something's happened.\" As her expression changed, Feng Nü, Long Ling, and Lan Zhen simultaneously felt a massive energy emanating from the dragon cave. This energy was very strange, and their Heavenly Eye acupoints couldn't determine its true attribute. The four women exchanged glances and, as if by agreement, floated towards the cave.\n\nAs soon as they rushed into the cave, they felt a powerful life force rushing towards them. They were propelled out with twice the speed they entered with, and along with them, five other Dragon Kings were also ejected.\n\nThe six Dragon Kings, Sha An, knowing what had happened, looked at each other with expressions of shock. They were all twelfth-level experts, and with the three eleventh-level Feng Nü and the others, such immense power would have been almost impossible for even the Dragon God to expel them from the cave instantly. Moreover, the Dark Dragon King Kajiossis had reached new heights in his strength since cultivating the Dragon God's Heart Sutra, approaching the thirteenth level.\n\nThe Earth Dragon King, Fatty, exclaimed in surprise, \"What's going on? Boss, is there something in your cave?\"\n\nThe Dark Dragon King Kajiossis shook his head, frowning, \"Impossible. When Di Manteti and I first moved in here, we thoroughly explored the surrounding environment. This energy is too strange. Such strong life energy, such strong power. It appeared without any warning. Did you lose anything?\"\n\nDi Manteti said, \"I am the Light Dragon King; my life energy is the strongest. Just now, I think I saw a green hexagram. Not only did it have life energy, but it also seemed to have some spatial energy.\"\n\nThe Space Dragon King Audris nodded and said, \"I felt it too, but this is the first time I've felt such spatial energy. It's too strange, what could it be? However, I can feel that this life energy is not malicious and doesn't seem to be attacking us.\"\n\nFeng Nü gasped, \"If it's not an attack, and it's already this powerful, then...\"\n\nThey all thought of the same problem. Facing such a situation, no one could speak. For a moment, they didn't know what to do. They didn't rashly rush into the cave again. The six Dragon Kings formed a semi-circle, and six-colored lights simultaneously flashed from them, constantly increasing their energy, ready to respond at any time.\n\nFeng Nü protected Lan Zhen and Long Ling behind her. She used her fire battle qi to fill the void left by the Fire Dragon King Jialamanidis. Although she was slightly weaker, the Phoenix Flame itself was not inferior to the Dragon's Flame. Combined with the power of the Six Dragon Kings, they formed a seven-element barrier, sealing the cave entrance.\n\nAt this very moment, a lazy voice echoed in everyone's minds, \"What? My friends, my wives, is this how you welcome me back?\"\n\nA figure slowly walked out from inside the cave. He didn't walk fast, but each step was firm and powerful. He had a slender build, wore golden mage robes, and his golden hair cascaded down his back. His pair of deep blue eyes shone as brightly as stars, and a faint seven-colored light shimmered behind him, accentuating his tall stature. A sunny smile played on his handsome face, and a light mist veiled his starry eyes. His awakened gaze made everyone's hearts tremble. He had returned.\n\n\"Nian... Bing...\"\n\nThese two words were a name that Feng Nü and the other two had longed for. After a year and a half, he had finally returned. The life energy surrounded his body, so real. Feng Nü clearly felt that Nian Bing now was just like when she first saw him. Yes, he had returned.\n\nThe figures in red, blue, and purple lunged towards Nian Bing almost simultaneously, opening their arms. Nian Bing embraced the three women in his arms. At this moment, there was no need for further words, for any words could not express their mutual longing.\n\nSilence, as the Six Dragon Kings smiled and let time flow. Since the Bottle of Sealed Mu'ordas was lost, they had never been this happy. The arduous wait of the three women had finally paid off. Their man had returned, and their Dragon Clan friends had returned.\n\nA low cough broke the silent air with a ripple. A short figure emerged from behind Nian Bing. \"Cough, cough, Nian Bing! Aren't you going to introduce me?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Nian Bing was startled out of his reunion joy. Looking at the tear-streaked faces of the three women, he quickly said, \"Come, let me introduce you. This is my good brother, Xiluo of the dwarf tribe. Xiluo, these three are my confidantes, my wives, and also your sisters-in-law.\" He then quickly introduced the three women and the Six Dragon Kings to the dwarf warrior who had returned with him.\n\nThe three women did not object to Nian Bing's introduction. Their wait had not been in vain. They had waited for their most beloved man and for Nian Bing's promise. There were no grand and magnificent ceremonies, but from this moment on, they all knew that they completely belonged to this man.\n\nKajiossis walked up to Nian Bing and grabbed his shoulder. The usually composed Dark Dragon King was trembling slightly with excitement. \"Good, you're finally back. Nian Bing, you've been gone for too long this time.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Yes! I'm finally back. I didn't expect myself that this journey would take so long. Are you all doing well? Is everyone doing well?\"\n\nKajiossis nodded with a smile, \"We're all well, everything is like before. It's just that these three wives of yours have waited very hard. You must comfort them well.\"\n\nNian Bing looked deeply at the three women. Feng Nü looked at him with gentle eyes, Lan Chen's eyes were full of ardor, and Long Ling was filled with excitement through her shyness. Their expressions were different, but their thoughts were the same. With such wives, he felt so happy.\n\nThe Space Dragon King Ka'audris leaned over and chuckled, \"Yes! Nian Bing, if you didn't come back, these three wives of yours would have turned into snotty brats.\"\n\n\"Who are you calling a snotty brat?\" The three women exclaimed in a coquettish tone simultaneously, startling Ka'audris. He took a step back, and his comical, awkward appearance immediately caused everyone to burst into laughter.\n\nDi Manteti asked, \"Nian Bing, did Lord Dragon God send you back? But what about that life energy just now?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"No, it wasn't. A friend of mine from the Divine Continent sent us back.\"\n\nDi Manteti hesitated for a moment before asking, \"Then, then Kaka...?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, and a colorful light burst from his forehead. A golden halo floated out with the colorful light, accompanied by a sonorous dragon roar. A beam of light projected from his forehead, and suddenly, another energy form of Nian Bing appeared before him. However, this \"Nian Bing\" was not wearing clothes and was covered in a layer of golden-gray scales.\n\n\"Mom, I'm back too.\" It was Kaka's voice.\n\nAlthough the appearance was the same, the voice and aura were completely different. Di Manteti no longer cared about being surprised and stepped forward, pulling his son into his embrace. \"Kaka—\"\n\nA warm atmosphere spread before the dragon cave. The temperature of the Cold Ridge seemed less intense. Xiluo looked at this reunion scene and couldn't help but lower his head somewhat sadly. He thought of his people, of his mother.\n\nNian Bing slept in the Lake of Life for a full half-year before truly completing the process of life reconstruction. In half a year, Tian Xiang had restored the Lake of Death. When Nian Bing woke up, she and Ka'ao had taught him many theoretical concepts. Nian Bing's strength had greatly increased, and he had finally reached the threshold of the twelfth level. Ka'ao had told him that he was like a vast treasure trove, and as long as he kept digging, his future potential was limitless. They never mentioned the scene in the lake. Nian Bing had asked with some embarrassment, but Ka'ao had replied that it was just a coincidence. He stayed on the Divine Continent for another half-year. Regardless of his reasons, while continuously learning theoretical knowledge, Nian Bing wholeheartedly brewed Baihuadeng¹ to leave for Ka'ao and Tian Xiang, bringing back only a very small portion for himself. After that, Ka'ao informed the Dragon God that Nian Bing had been resurrected. The Dragon God returned Kaka to Nian Bing, and with the immense power of Ka'ao, sent Nian Bing back to the Yangguang Continent.\n\nAfter the joy, everyone returned to the dragon cave. Kajiossis couldn't help but inquire about Nian Bing's situation on the Divine Continent. Nian Bing didn't say much about Ka'ao's affairs, nor did he prevaricate. He simply shook his head in response to Kajiossis's questions; some things couldn't be casually revealed, as they involved too much. He only briefly introduced Xiluo, stating that Xiluo was his friend and that the Dragon God had asked him to bring Xiluo to the Yangguang Continent. Kajiossis had once been part of the Lost Continent and had deep affection for its races, so he didn't say much.\n\n\"Kaka, what about you? What have you and Lord Dragon God learned? Why can Nian Bing separate you from his body?\" Di Manteti was most concerned about his son.\n\nKaka smiled and said, \"Mom, I've learned a lot from Lord Dragon God, and I finally understand the attribute of my abilities. With Lord Dragon God's help, I realized that my ability belongs to a state called 'Void.' It is an extremely special ability. I can instantly transform energy and unleash the effect of any magic through this ability. In other words, I can be considered any type of dragon. However, I cannot use two abilities simultaneously. This is where I'm inferior to Nian Bing's fusion magic.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Aren't you satisfied? Although you can't use multiple elements simultaneously, you can master the first element. This is an advantage I don't have. Moreover, I always feel that your Void attribute ability has some special aspects. As long as you diligently cultivate the Dragon God's Heart Sutra, you will definitely become a powerful Dragon King in the future. Haven't you already reached the fourth level of the Dragon God's Heart Sutra?\n\nMy mental power has improved somewhat during this time. Kaka's current body is formed by my mental power combined with magical elements. In reality, his soul is still within me and cannot be shared. He is merely displaying his current appearance through remote control. However, being able to reach this point, I believe that the reconstruction of his physical body with his soul sharing will not be unreasonably delayed. This is also inseparable from Kaka's own efforts. Compared to when he left, he is much more powerful now.\"\n\n---\n¹ *Baihuadeng* (百花露) translates literally to \"Dew of a Hundred Flowers.\" It is a type of precious elixir.",

    "content": "Kaka put on a smug face and chuckled, \"Of course, who do you think I am? I'm the successor to the Dragon God of the next few generations.\"\n\nKajiosi said with annoyance, \"You learn everything but the good stuff, and instead pick up habits from that guy Kaodis. You must remember, your current status is due to the Dragon God's tolerance. Only by working harder and serving my Dragon Tribe wholeheartedly in the future can you repay the Dragon God's kindness.\"\n\nKaka stuck out his tongue and said, \"Got it, Father.\"\n\nKaodis said displeased, \"Hey, boss, don't drag me into it when you're lecturing your son. What did I do to deserve this?!\"\n\nKajiosi ignored Kaodis and stood up, \"Let's go outside for some activity. Island Hal, you come with me too, I'll show you the scenery of the Yangguang Continent.\"\n\nThe Six Dragon Kings and Kaka, along with the dwarf warrior Island Hal, walked out of the cave. Kajiosi's intention was simple: to leave the space within the cave for Nian Bing and his three beloveds. The Dragon Kings saw the suffering of the three women from longing, and since Nian Bing had finally returned, they couldn't bear to delay the reunion of the four any further.\n\nOnly Nian Bing and the three women remained. At this moment, he didn't know what to say, only gazing at them. A surge of tender affection rose in his heart. He slowly took the right hands of the three women, placing his left hand at the bottom and his right hand on top, feeling the rapid heartbeats of the three women. His heart was intoxicated.\n\nFen Nu was the first to speak, \"Nian Bing, you're back. I want to leave.\" It seemed she had to exert great effort to say this. As soon as she finished speaking, she sadly lowered her head.\n\nNian Bing's heart raced. \"Fen Nu, what's wrong? Don't you believe my love for you? Or... you still don't forgive me?\"\n\nFen Nu shook her head and said, \"What's past is past, but I must leave now. During your absence, the continent has undergone earth-shattering changes.\"\n\nNian Bing let out a sigh. As long as Fen Nu didn't blame him anymore, other matters would be much easier to handle. Just as he was about to say something, he heard Fen Nu continue, \"Originally, I wanted to go to the Ice God's Temple with Ling'er and Chen Chen to rescue Uncle and Aunt. It would also fulfill your wish. Now that you're back, I can see that you've not only recovered your vitality but also greatly increased your strength. With you accompanying them, and with Chen Chen's familiarity with the Ice God's Temple, they should be able to rescue them even without me.\"\n\n\"The continent has changed? What are you referring to?\" Nian Bing asked, tightening his grip on the three women's hands. Having finally returned, he truly didn't want to be separated from them.\n\nFen Nu looked up at Nian Bing and said, \"The changes began with the Huáróng Empire. Half a year after you left, the Huáróng Empire, riding the momentum from the previous war against the Lángmù Empire, started a war. However, this time, their target was no longer the Lángmù Empire, but the neighboring Qílǔ Empire. Led by your grandfather, Prince Róng, the Huáróng Empire, with the Flame Dragon Knight Legion and the Flame Lion Knight Legion at its core, launched a surprise attack on the Qílǔ Empire. In just three months, disregarding the loss of cities or territories, they struck directly at the Qílǔ Empire's capital. With the arrival of follow-up forces, they captured the Qílǔ King alive and forcibly compelled the Qílǔ Empire to surrender. Within another three months, they had firmly grasped the Qílǔ Empire under their control, expanding their territory by two-fifths at the minimal cost, occupying a vast area in the south.\"\n\nUpon hearing this news, Nian Bing was shocked. The Qílǔ Empire, as one of the five great empires on the continent, although not as powerful as the Huáróng Empire, nor as resource-rich as the Lángmù Empire, was still considered a strong nation, much stronger than the Àolán Empire.\n\nTo be conquered by Huáróng in just half a year was indeed news that could shake the entire continent.\n\nNian Bing had only heard of the Flame Dragon Knight Legion before. He vaguely felt that the Huáróng Empire's successive victories against two major empires and its incorporation of the Qílǔ Empire were likely related to the sudden appearance of this powerful knight legion. Recalling the vast underground network of the Blood Lion Cult and the Huáróng Empire's years of cultivation, conquering the Qílǔ Empire was not too difficult.\n\nWhen it came to commanding wars, there was truly no one on the entire Yangguang Continent who could match his grandfather!\n\nAfter a brief contemplation, Nian Bing said, \"The war with the Qílǔ Empire was likely meticulously planned by Grandpa. First, they used elite troops for a surprise attack on the Lángmù Empire, dealing a devastating blow to their elite knight legions, and plundering the rich southern plains of the Lángmù Empire. This not only yielded a large amount of precious resources but also temporarily paralyzed the Lángmù Empire's production. The reason Grandpa didn't covet the territory gained in the Lángmù plains was mainly because the Lángmù Empire was vast and resourceful, and had accumulated strength through years of recuperation, making it impossible to defeat in one blow. If other countries were to wage war against the Huáróng Empire under such circumstances, fighting on two or even three fronts would put the Huáróng Empire in a dilemma. Therefore, Grandpa only plundered a large amount of resources and retreated back to his own country. This battle not only greatly enhanced the prestige of the Huáróng Empire, exerting strong deterrence on the surrounding three countries, but also temporarily weakened the Lángmù Empire, rendering it unable to invade southward. The Huáróng Empire's losses in that battle were negligible, making it an extremely successful campaign. The vast resources recovered made the Huáróng Empire unprecedentedly strong. After adjustments, they stationed a small number of troops near the mountains bordering Lángmù, relying on the natural defenses to prevent the intimidated Lángmù Empire from making any moves. Then, they mobilized the entire country to launch a surprise attack on the Qílǔ Empire. Based on the resources obtained from the Lángmù Empire, they achieved their goal. The Àolán Empire, unable to intervene due to the previous war, was in a period of recovery and could only watch this unfold. Truly perfect strategy!\"\n\nFen Nu smiled slightly, approvingly, \"You were not on the continent, yet you saw it as if you were there. That is exactly what happened. After the Qílǔ Empire fell into the hands of the Huáróng Empire, the Lángmù Empire finally reacted and mobilized a large army to wage war, taking advantage of the Huáróng Empire's internal emptiness. Unfortunately, Prince Róng, leading his two main knight legions, rushed back to the northern front at the fastest speed. Relying on the natural defenses and the Northern Army Group, they once again repelled the Lángmù Empire, forcing them to defend themselves without being able to take a single step forward. They initially secured their victory.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Fen Nu, \"What you are worried about is likely your mother's situation in the Àolán Empire. What happened next? What happened in the subsequent nine months? Did the Huáróng Empire also attack the Àolán Empire? That's impossible, isn't it? The Qílǔ Empire was a major power, and the Huáróng Empire must have paid a considerable price to conquer its entire territory. They also needed to consolidate their victory. It would be difficult for them to launch another war against the Àolán Empire!\"\n\nFen Nu said with a wry smile, \"You are so smart. Yes, I am worried about Mother. Your deductions are all correct, but you still underestimated your grandfather and Emperor Huátiān. While your grandfather was waging war against the Qílǔ Empire, the Huáróng Empire's Prime Minister, Su Yu, had already led a delegation to the Àolán Empire to persuade them to submit to the Huáróng Empire. It was precisely because of the appearance of this delegation that the Àolán Empire, which should have assisted the Qílǔ Empire, missed its best opportunity. When the Qílǔ Empire was destroyed, and the Huáróng Empire's Eastern and Northeastern Army Groups each sent half their forces to guard the borders, watching menacingly, the Àolán Empire had no chance. Although I don't know what specifically happened, the Prime Minister Su Yu's prowess is likely not inferior to your grandfather's. Currently, the two countries are in negotiations. The Huáróng Empire has offered generous terms, allowing the Àolán Empire to govern itself, but it must acknowledge Huáróng's suzerainty and pay tribute annually.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes flashed repeatedly. \"The Àolán Empire won't agree, right? You know, if the Àolán Empire submits to the Huáróng Empire, then the Huáróng Empire can utilize the geographical advantages of the Àolán Empire to attack the already isolated Lángmù Empire at any time. The original mountain barrier between the two countries will no longer be effective. As long as the Lángmù Emperor is not foolish, he would never allow such a thing to happen.\"\n\nFen Nu nodded. \"That's right. As soon as the Lángmù Empire's attack on the Huáróng Empire failed, they immediately dispatched capable envoys to the Àolán Empire to lobby them. According to the news obtained from outside by Miss Xuè Jìng, the three countries have been negotiating.\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment. \"The Lángmù Empire will likely use its economic strength to support the Àolán Empire, intending to form an alliance. Only in this way can they stop the Huáróng Empire's northern advance. Now it depends on how the Àolán Empire chooses. The Huáróng Empire is not afraid of delays. With the territory of the Qílǔ Empire, the longer it drags on, the more advantageous it will be for them. As long as they can reorganize their army with the resources obtained and with my grandfather's command, in the near future, even if the Àolán and Lángmù empires join forces, they may not be able to stop the Huáróng Empire's attack. Grandpa! It seems you really want to unify the entire continent in your lifetime.\"\n\nFen Nu said, \"Originally, before you returned, I couldn't possibly focus on anything else. But now that you're back, Mother needs help there. With Chen Chen and Ling'er accompanying you, I can rest assured. I have never been able to fulfill my filial duties to my parents since I was young, so I want to go to Àolán City to contribute my meager efforts.\"\n\nLán Chén suddenly said, \"Sister, I'll go back with you too.\"\n\nFen Nu looked at her sister with gentle eyes and shook her head. \"No, you don't need to come back with me. Nian Bing needs your help at the Ice God's Temple, as only you are familiar with the specific conditions there. Actually, how can political matters be influenced by just one or two of us? I'm just doing my best. You know what Father is like better than I do. I'm afraid that no matter what happens with the Àolán Empire, he won't leave. Nian Bing, I know you are from the Huáróng Empire, please don't worry, I won't make things difficult for you.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes flashed as he looked at Fen Nu's reluctance. He suddenly smiled, \"Silly girl, how can I let you go back by yourself? Since you want to go, let's go together. They are not only your parents, but also my parents! As for my biological parents, ever since Chen Chen told me they are living together, I am no longer worried. I believe they will forgive me for rescuing them a little late. I know my father very well; as long as he can be with Mother, no matter where they are, he will be content.\"\n\nFen Nu's delicate body trembled. Looking at Nian Bing's smile, her heart became fiery.\n\nHow could she bear to leave the newly returned Nian Bing? Hearing Nian Bing say this now, she could feel his deep affection even more.\n\nNian Bing held the hands of the three women tightly. \"Intelligence first. We don't need to rush to the Àolán Empire. Even if we get there, we'll be in the dark. Only by understanding the current situation can we make the most correct decision. Therefore, I want to go to Ice Moon City first to gather information about the current situation on the continent. Yan Feng is my good brother. I think he's not having an easy time either. With the continent in such turmoil, the Ice Moon Empire is unlikely to remain neutral. I also want to hear his opinion.\"\n\nHe hadn't been to the Blood Lion Cult for a year and a half. With the Blood Lion Cult's intelligence network, he could more clearly understand what was happening on the continent and better assess the current situation to make decisions. Nian Bing was indeed conflicted: on one side were his grandfather and family, and on the other were his godmother, Fen Nu, and Lan Chen's mother.\n\nMoreover, there was Yan Feng. Since the Huáróng Empire had started a war, it was likely that eventually, the flames of war would spread to the Ice Moon Empire. He always felt a bit of guilt towards Yan Feng and wanted to find an opportunity to help him. Now was the best time.\n\nFen Nu breathed a sigh of relief, and Lan Chen also secretly felt relieved. She really didn't want to face her master, although she knew there would be a day for that.\n\nBut now, she preferred to escape. As for Dragon Spirit, seeing Nian Bing again, she would have no objections to whatever Nian Bing decided to do.\n\n\"Nian Bing, Nian Bing, good brother, you're finally back!\" The excited voice made the stone walls of the cave tremble. This familiar voice warmed Nian Bing's heart. He stood up and shouted, \"Brother Gallamanthos, I'm here!\"",

    "content": "The red figure zipped through the corridor like a flame. Familiar face appeared before him, and Nian Bing’s eyes moistened. Fire Dragon King Galadris was still the same. His dragon eyes revealed strong emotions. Among the Seven Dragon Kings, Galadris had the deepest bond with Nian Bing. It was this Fire Dragon King who gradually led Nian Bing into the ranks of the strong. Their brotherhood was beyond words.\n\nGaladris looked Nian Bing up and down, grabbed his shoulders with both hands, and laughed, “Good, good brother, you’ve truly returned. Excellent. It looks like you’ve fully recovered. My old man really has a way; he could bring you back from that state.”\n\nNian Bing smiled, “Brother, how have you been all this time? You and Xue Jing…”\n\nGaladris puffed out his chest, “Do I even need to ask? Your big brother is so handsome, dashing, and suave. Jing’er has been mine for a long time. She can’t wait to have such a good husband as me. However, you’re the one who’s really good, managing to get three at once.”\n\n“Who can’t wait, hmm?” A charming voice chimed in as a graceful figure strode in and went straight to Galadris’s side, grabbing his ear. Her gaze, however, fell on Nian Bing. It was Xue Jing.\n\nGaladris cried out in pain, “I, I can’t wait, Miss. Go easy, please. Although my dragon ears are very sturdy, I can’t handle you pulling them every day!” Although he was crying out in pain, it was clear he was faking. A trace of sweetness gleamed in his eyes. Even Xue Jing, who was pulling his ear, had a smile on her face. Clearly, this was a common occurrence.\n\nNian Bing chuckled, “Xue Jing, it’s been over a year, and you’re still the same.”\n\nXue Jing snorted with annoyance, “You actually remember to come back! Making Ling’er and her two older sisters so sad. I really want to beat you up. Galadris, you deal with him for me.” She was self-aware enough to know she couldn’t defeat Nian Bing.\n\nGaladris gave a wry smile, “I can’t even beat one of his four! You know how fast Feng Nu and the others have improved. If I made a move on Nian Bing, your good sisters would probably be the first to step in. Nian Bing, you’ve returned at just the right time. The entire Yang Guang Continent is in chaos right now.” Hearing the first half of his sentence, the three women, Long Ling, couldn’t help but blush. Their gazes simultaneously fell on Nian Bing. At this moment, only their beloved was in their eyes.\n\nNian Bing nodded, “I’ve already heard from Feng Nu. I didn’t expect so much to have changed on the continent in just over a year. Oh, right, Xue Jing, how was the Culinary God Competition?” Nian Bing felt great regret for not being able to participate in this year’s Culinary God Competition. More than a year had passed since the competition, and the results had undoubtedly been announced long ago.\n\nXue Jing sighed softly, “What else could it be? Without you, Uncle Ming naturally participated. However, Uncle Ming and his junior sister didn’t even place, despite teaming up. The culinary world has reached another peak period, with experts from all sides gathered. It’s too difficult to win the title of Culinary God. In the culinary world, this Culinary God Competition is considered the most prestigious since the retirement of the Five Divine Chefs. It’s a pity I couldn’t go; I really wanted to see that scene!”\n\nNian Bing’s eyes lit up, “If I’m not mistaken, the final champion should be someone named Xiao Tian. At least, he should have placed in the top three.”\n\nXue Jing was surprised, “You know this? You just got back! Yes, it was that Xiao Tian. I heard from Uncle Ming that this Xiao Tian is incredibly strong. Uncle Ming said that even you might not be able to defeat him. His culinary skills are too miraculous. Even the two people assisting him are top-tier chefs. The three of them, working together, ultimately defeated everyone and won this year’s championship.”\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, “This was to be expected. I’ve clashed with Xiao Tian once before, and it was a draw. With his Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand, one of the Seven Forbidden Hands, if he couldn’t win the championship, I would be surprised.”\n\n“Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand, yes, that’s it. And his first assistant is also very formidable. His name is something like Mo Mo. The two of them coordinated flawlessly, giving other contestants no chance. They almost won first place in every category. Alas, it’s a shame you weren’t here; otherwise, we might have had a chance to compete with them.”\n\nNian Bing’s heart jolted, “Mo Mo assisting Xiao Tian? How is that possible?” Back then, in the Hua Long Culinary Challenge, Mo Mo was a chef just below him and Xiao Tian. That Mo Mo would be willing to be Xiao Tian’s assistant was something Nian Bing truly hadn’t expected.\n\nXue Jing replied, “Why wouldn’t it be possible? It’s their business. Nian Bing, I don’t care. There are still over three years until the next Culinary God Competition. You must put aside all your affairs and compete for our Qing Feng Zhai. We need you to win first place and make us proud. However, that Xiao Tian, despite winning the championship, didn’t seem very excited. Uncle Ming said that Xiao Tian mentioned an opponent who didn’t participate in the competition during his final speech. That was the opponent he truly wished to see. This wouldn’t be you, would it?”\n\nNian Bing’s eyes flickered, “Xiao Tian! Xiao Tian, are you really waiting for me? I disappointed you this time, but next time, I believe it will be our decisive battle. Over three years is enough time for me to handle all my affairs.” Thinking this, he nodded firmly and said, “Xue Jing, even if you hadn’t said anything, I would have to fight him once. Let’s see whose Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand is more powerful, or whose overall strength is greater.” The increase in his magical power had greatly enhanced Nian Bing’s comprehension in all aspects. At his level of culinary skill, extensive practice was no longer needed; inner enlightenment was the key. Xue Jing’s simple words had filled him with fighting spirit. Although it wasn’t time to fight yet, he already considered Xiao Tian his strongest opponent in culinary arts. The stronger the opponent, the more excited Nian Bing became. Only by constantly surpassing opponents and improving himself could his culinary skills become more perfect.\n\nXue Jing continued, “That’s good. As long as you’re willing to compete for us, we’ll overlook you being away for over a year. Take good care of our Ling’er from now on.”\n\nNian Bing smiled, “I will. Xue Jing, you just returned from the Ice Moon Empire. Has the situation on the continent changed at all? Do you know how the negotiations with the Olan Empire are progressing? What is the Olan Empire’s decision?”\n\nXue Jing shook her head, “I’m not too sure. I never pay attention to politics. We run a hotel. No matter how much the continent shakes, people still need to eat. What do those politics have to do with us?” As she spoke, her expression suddenly changed, as if she had thought of something. “Oh, right, there is one thing I should tell you. Not only is the Olan Empire in a difficult situation, but the Ice Moon Empire also seems to be in a precarious state. Your good brother Yan Feng is quite troubled right now. This is because he received an invitation from the Hua Rong Empire, asking the Ice Moon Empire to send envoys to the Hua Rong Empire to participate in something called the Four-Nation Forum.”\n\nNian Bing frowned, “Four-Nation Forum? What is that? What exactly is the Hua Rong Empire planning?”\n\nXue Jing shook her head, “I’m not entirely clear about that. However, this forum seems to have been proposed by the Hua Rong Empire and the Lang Mu Empire. Before I returned, I seemed to see envoys from the Lang Mu Empire also arriving in the Ice Moon Empire, passing through Ice Snow City, and heading towards Ice Moon City, I presume. I really don’t know what they are doing. The Ice Moon Empire is only mid-tier among the various nations. It’s only with the Ice Goddess’s sacrifice that it has vaguely become a major power. But the Ice God Tower, since Yan Feng inherited the throne, seems to have adopted a rather cold attitude towards the Ice Moon Empire, even failing to send experts from the tower to serve as Yan Feng’s guards. The situation is delicate now. For specific details, I’m afraid only your brother would know.”\n\nNian Bing nodded, glanced at Feng Nu and the other two women, and said, “It seems my choice was correct. Let’s go to Ice Moon City first. No matter what the Four-Nation Forum discusses, it’s unlikely the Olan Empire will make any hasty commitments before the conference concludes. Perhaps we can directly meet Mother and the others in the Hua Rong Empire.”\n\nFeng Nu nodded, “Everything is up to your arrangements. We’ll listen to you.”\n\nGaladris looked at Nian Bing. Xue Jing had already released him. “Brother, you’re leaving in such a hurry after just returning? Won’t you stay a few more days with us?”\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile, “The continent is in turmoil now. My grandfather, and Feng Nu and Chen Chen’s parents are all involved in this struggle. Although the few of us might not be able to do much, we should still do our best, at least to ensure our relatives’ safety. I don’t want to see a bad situation develop. Otherwise, how can I be at ease?” He did have some internal conflict, but it wasn’t strong. The biggest difference since his return was his greatly enhanced confidence, not only due to his increased strength but also the evolution of his Tianyan acupoint, which gave him clearer control over major aspects. The combined strength of himself and the three women, Feng Nu, was undoubtedly a formidable small group. While they might not be able to control the political situation, Nian Bing was confident they could navigate it, and the outcome would depend on their efforts. Moreover, Nian Bing, as the leader of the Blood Lion Sect, possessed the largest underground force, which was also a reason for his strong confidence. The situation was not yet entirely clear, and there were many avenues for action. He now only hoped that nothing had changed in the Blood Lion Sect after over a year of absence.\n\nGaladris smiled, “Then you go ahead. Whenever you want to return, we’ll all be waiting here for you. Nian Bing, do you remember those who tried to steal the Seal Bottle of Muodas?”\n\nNian Bing’s eyes flashed with cold light, “I remember, of course, I remember. Those people left a deep impression on me.” The figure of Xie Yue flashed in his mind. Back then, he had nearly lost his life in front of those powerful figures from the dark forces. How could he forget?\n\nGaladris continued, “In about half a year, it will be the Day of Extreme Yin, as spoken of by Lord Dragon God. Such a rare opportunity is hard to come by in a century. I believe those dark forces will not let this chance slip away. They will definitely find a way to use this moment to break the seal of the Muodas Seal Bottle. At that time, I hope you will join us to stop them.”\n\nA hint of hesitation appeared in Nian Bing’s eyes. He sighed and said, “Is it truly right to stop them? Is the Divine Continent truly the realm of gods? I’ve been there, and I only realized it should be called hell. Brother Galadris, it’s not that I don’t want to help you, but looking at the strength of Xie Yue’s group, if nothing unexpected happens, they stand no chance against the Seven Dragon Kings. Moreover, as far as I know, the Divine Continent will also send divine beings to assist you.”\n\nGaladris was surprised, “You’re unwilling to participate? Have you forgotten the harm Xie Yue’s gang inflicted upon you?”\n\nNian Bing shook his head, “No, I certainly haven’t forgotten. I have no good feelings towards Xie Yue and her group. However, my attitude towards the Lost Continent is different. Perhaps, I believe the return of the Lost Continent might be better for our world.”\n\nGaladris looked at Nian Bing with some incomprehension. Nian Bing looked back at him similarly. After a moment, Galadris sighed, “Since you are unwilling to go, I will not force you. You decide for yourself. The Lost Continent cannot return, otherwise, it will bring immense turmoil to our world. No one can predict what will happen, so we will definitely do our utmost to prevent the opening of the Muodas Seal Bottle.”\n\nNian Bing was actually very hesitant. If it were for Xi Lu, he would naturally want the Lost Continent to return. Even for the Yang Guang Continent, he would be willing to see the Lost Continent return. After all, compared to the Divine Continent, the people of the Lost Empire seemed much stronger. However, his worry stemmed from Xie Yue. Xie Yue’s group practiced all sorts of sinister arts. If, as the prophecy stated, the Lost Empire submitted to Xie Yue upon their return, the destruction to the human world would likely be no less than that caused by the Divine Continent. At that time, catastrophe would be unavoidable. Therefore, he was now in a state of indecision, not knowing what he should do. Thus, he refused Galadris’s proposal, letting fate decide. Who knew what destiny held? What he needed to do was to first complete all the matters that required his attention.\n\nFeng Nu took Nian Bing’s hand and glanced at the somewhat displeased Galadris. Nian Bing looked back at her. He naturally understood Feng Nu’s meaning. Without Galadris, Nian Bing would probably not be where he was today. This kindness could not be repaid.",

    "content": "Thinking of this, Nian Bing took a deep breath and said, \"Big Brother, please don't be angry with your little brother. You also came from the Divine Continent. You should know things over there better than I do. How about this, although I might not necessarily help you, I might not necessarily reach there at that time. If anything threatening to you were to happen, your little brother would not shirk his responsibility.\"\n\nGalathos laughed heartily and said, \"Good, this is my good brother. Actually, I understand what you mean. Our Seven Dragon Kings are willing to stay in the Yanggu Continent not only because of the good life here, but the more important reason is that we don't want to deal with those gods. Those guys disgust me just looking at them. However, the Lost Continent has been gone for tens of thousands of years. Who knows how they have developed? If they have already developed to a point that the Divine Continent cannot even catch up, I'm afraid our world will face a great disaster. Therefore, it's better to be safe than sorry. Since the battle between gods and men ten thousand years ago has already decided the winner, why add more variables? Alright, I won't disturb your reunion as a couple. Jingjing, let's go outside.\" After speaking, he gave Nian Bing a deep look before pulling Xue Qing towards the cave entrance.\n\nWatching their retreating figures, Nian Bing fell into thought. Galathos's words also had his reasoning. That's right! No one could predict what the Lost Continent would be like when it returned. Ten thousand years ago, they were already able to make the Divine Continent unable to resist. If it weren't for the intervention of three True Gods, the so-called gods in the world would have long ceased to exist. After tens of thousands of years of reproduction, who knows what has happened on the Lost Continent? If there really were a few experts at the True God level, just the impact of their battles on various continents could be...\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing felt a sense of relief. At least, he no longer felt that Galathos's idea was wrong. It was still the same feeling, let everything take its course. These matters were not of great importance to him. What he needed to do was to protect his friends and family. Achieving this was enough. Thinking of this, he pulled the three women in front of him, embraced them in his broad arms, and felt the fulfilling beauty. He secretly sighed, \"It's good to be alive!\"\n\nNian Bing only stayed in the Cold Ridge for one day. The next morning, he, Xilu, and the three women bid farewell to the Seven Dragon Kings. Xue Jing also wanted to leave with them, but Galathos, citing his inability to protect Xue Jing, made her stay. The Day of Ultimate Yin was approaching, and the Seven Dragon Kings should begin their final preparations. At this time, Galathos could not leave casually.\n\nThe wind gently blew the clouds in the sky, and a gentle light appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. The air was a bit cold. As the empire at the northernmost end of the continent, this had always been the symbol of the Ice Moon Empire. This pure cold could not affect them at all. At this moment, the five people were all excited. The three women had finally waited for Nian Bing. No matter what difficulties they would face, they believed that as long as they were with Nian Bing, nothing would be an obstacle anymore.\n\nThe most excited one was Xilu. Having just arrived on this beautiful continent, it gave him a completely new feeling. At this moment, flying in the air with the help of Nian Bing's wind magic, looking at the blue sky, feeling the warm sunlight and fresh air, he finally truly understood his mother's painstaking efforts. Yes, his mother chose death for him back then. From the perspective of the Dwarf race, this was definitely the right choice. It turned out that there really were such beautiful places in the world. Here, everything he touched existed only in legends. Being able to feel all this beauty was all thanks to his mother. Only by walking out of the cage of the Divine Continent could one see this wonderful world.\n\nFlying slowly, Nian Bing held Long Ling's hand. Among the three women, Long Ling's strength was slightly weaker, while Xilu, though powerful, did not have the ability to fly. Feng Nu and Lan Chen followed behind them, spreading their red and blue wings. They always hoped that their beloved could see them.\n\nThey flew for a whole day, and as night gradually fell, the five finally arrived near Ice Moon City. Nian Bing led the other four to land on a small hill and stopped.\n\n\"Brother Xilu, there are some things I need to tell you in advance,\" Nian Bing said, patting Xilu's shoulder.\n\nXilu gave a honest smile and said, \"Brother, just say what you need to say.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"We are about to enter a human city. Your height is about 1.4 meters, which is quite noticeable among human males. Also, there are many new things in the human world that you haven't seen before. I hope you can remain calm no matter what you see and try not to attract others' attention, okay?\"\n\nXilu nodded and said, \"I understand what you mean, but everything else is fine. It's just my height, I'm afraid...\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"This is not a difficult matter. I have a way.\" As he said this, the light in his eyes flashed, and he gently waved his right hand forward. With a flash of light, an earth shadow puppet that looked exactly like him appeared before them. After the seven divine blades evolved into divine artifacts, the shadow puppets also took on a tangible form like the Black Warrior Emperor. Nian Bing pondered for a moment and communicated with the earth shadow puppet. The previously dull gaze of the earth shadow puppet gained a bit of spirit, and it nodded at Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing said to Xilu, \"Brother, relax yourself. I will have the earth shadow puppet merge with your body, and this way, your appearance can be changed. Don't resist. It won't affect your combat power, it just changes your appearance.\"\n\nXilu nodded and said, \"Then what are we waiting for? Come on. Brother Nian Bing, your magic is truly amazing!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. Although he could achieve this was inseparable from the energy of the seven divine blades, the more important factor was his spiritual power. Only when spiritual power reached his level could he truly control these seven divine artifacts!\n\nYellow light condensed around the earth shadow puppet's body. With a flash of light, the Changsheng Blade, which carried the melody of the awakening earth, appeared in Nian Bing's hand. The yellow light lost its original form and gradually condensed into a ball, floating in front of Xilu. Xilu's Dwarf God Armor vibrated slightly, emitting a faint hum. Xilu smiled slightly, communicated with his beloved armor with his mind, relaxed his whole body, and let the pure earth elements cleanse his body.\n\nThe yellow light gradually enveloped Xilu's sturdy body, and the light gradually shone. Xilu clearly felt the earth elements in the air constantly condensing towards him and merging with the surface of his body.\n\nAt this moment, Feng Nu and the other two witnessed a wondrous sight. Under the cover of the yellow light, Xilu's appearance gradually became unclear. The yellow light was constantly lengthening with the fluctuations, and its form was constantly changing with the energy transformation.\n\nNian Bing closed his eyes, and the light on his brow turned a faint yellow. The Changsheng Blade in his hand glowed, and with a flash of light, he suddenly threw the Changsheng Blade out. Under the effect of the yellow light, the Changsheng Blade floated and merged into Xilu's body. With the constant agitation of the earth elements, a tall young man appeared before them.\n\nAs the yellow light receded, everything returned to normal. Xilu looked at his body in surprise. At this moment, he felt no discomfort at all, only that his body was filled with the aura of earth elements. Moving his now taller body, it seemed like there was no change. He could still control it as before. However, he discovered that his height had become similar to Nian Bing's.\n\nNian Bing looked at Xilu with satisfaction. He hadn't made many changes to Xilu's appearance. It was just that under the action of the earth elements, an earth-element barrier had formed around Xilu's body. With the effect of the Changsheng Blade, the earth elements had completely merged with his body's surface. From the outside, the Dwarf God Armor was no longer visible. Xilu's current appearance was as if he had suddenly grown two feet taller. He looked tall and mighty, his muscles still bulging, with no sign of disharmony.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"It's successful. Brother Xilu, do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?\"\n\nXilu kept looking at various parts of his body. To his surprise, not only was his body reshaped, but even the warrior's shirt on the surface was condensed from earth elements. On the back of his vest, a strong earth element energy was continuously absorbing earth elements from the air, maintaining his body's appearance, as if it would never change.\n\n\"It's so magical! Magic is so fun. Unfortunately, I can't learn it anymore, otherwise, I would definitely ask you to teach me some.\" With a change in appearance, Xilu became even more excited. Now, he had truly transformed into a human form, and he was incredibly happy.\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Your current body is actually an extra layer of earth elements added to your original body. This body has the energy of the Changsheng Blade as its core. As long as you are willing, with the speed at which the Changsheng Blade absorbs earth elements from the air, you can maintain this appearance forever without changing. Alright, we can enter the city now. Brother, you must remember what I told you earlier.\"\n\nXilu laughed and said, \"Don't worry. I may not have as much experience as you, but you are far younger than me. I naturally know what to do and what not to do.\"\n\nThe five stopped flying and walked on foot from the hill onto the official road, heading towards Ice Moon City.\n\nIce Moon City, as one of the most famous cities on the continent, had not changed much. The guards at the city gate were majestic and orderly, just as before. The changes in the Ice Moon Empire over a year ago seemed to have not happened, and everything had returned to normal.\n\nWithout being stopped, the five people entered the city. Because Feng Nu and the other two were too stunning, Nian Bing deliberately made them all change into coarse cloth clothes and wear straw hats to conceal their beauty. In Nian Bing's heart, there was also a bit of selfishness. Like ordinary men, he also wished that the beauty of his beloved would only bloom before him.\n\nAfter entering Ice Moon City, Nian Bing, without waiting, had a simple meal with the other four and then went directly to the Warrior's Guild. He first needed to contact the Blood Lion Cult. With a vast intelligence network, doing anything would be much easier.\n\nThe golden magic robe was exceptionally conspicuous. As soon as they arrived at the entrance of the Warrior's Guild, it attracted the attention of the guards. The guards here were all members of the Blood Lion Cult themselves, but the lower-level members did not recognize Nian Bing. Two warriors directly blocked them.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Magicians rarely appeared here.\n\nNian Bing calmly said, \"Take me to see Yin Dang.\"\n\nThe warriors snorted and said, \"Want to see our Guild Master? Who are you?\"\n\nNian Bing looked directly at the two warriors, and a hint of brilliance flashed in his eyes. The two warriors only felt a wave of dizziness in their minds, and their consciousness instantly became blurry. Although they had also undergone training from the Blood Lion Cult and their willpower was much stronger than ordinary people, in front of Nian Bing's spiritual power, there was no possibility of resistance.\n\n\"Take me to see Yin Dang,\" Nian Bing repeated his words. This time, the guard warriors only responded with a low \"yes\" and hurriedly led them into the Warrior's Guild.\n\nUpon entering, the familiar scene greeted their eyes. It was still as chaotic as ever in the spacious hall. Warriors were either accepting various missions or coming here to complete missions. Nian Bing ignored the gazes around him and didn't care that his golden magic robe had become the focus of the hall. Led by the two warriors, the five people went straight to the back.\n\nPassing through a doorway, Nian Bing ordered the two warriors to return to their posts. He then stopped and spread his spiritual power like ripples in water, covering the entire Warrior's Guild in an instant. Standing in place, he quietly said, \"Yin Dang, come out and see me.\" His voice was not loud. Xilu found it strange who Nian Bing was talking to, but Long Ling and the other two women who cultivated magic trembled simultaneously. Nian Bing's voice seemed to come from the depths of their souls, making them tremble. The three women had all opened their Heavenly Eye acupoints and were no longer unfamiliar with spiritual power. Feeling Nian Bing's boundless spiritual power, they couldn't help but be awestruck. Nian Bing hadn't told them about what happened on the Divine Continent, but they, whose strength had greatly increased, clearly felt that Nian Bing was unfathomable.\n\nYin Dang was handling some daily affairs of the guild. While Long Ling and the other two women felt Nian Bing's voice through spiritual power, for him, Nian Bing's voice was like a thunderclap from a clear sky, making his brain spin. In his shock, he immediately identified the source of the voice and hurried out of the room.\n\nWhen Yin Dang saw Nian Bing in the golden magic robe, he finally breathed a sigh of relief, and surprise and joy lit up his eyes. He strode up to Nian Bing, knelt on one knee, and respectfully said, \"Your subordinate greets you belatedly. Please forgive me, my lord.\" Since Feng Nu and the others were present, he did not rashly call out the title of Cult Master.",

    "content": "Perceiving the surprised gazes of the three Dragon Spirits, Nian Bing said, \"Get up. Let's talk in the inner room.\"\n\nYin Dang sincerely agreed and stood up, leading Nian Bing and the other four to the conference room.\n\nClosing the door, Yin Dang stood beside Nian Bing, his hands by his side. He glanced at Feng Nü and the others and asked in a low voice, \"Master, who are they?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"It's fine, they're all insiders. Hall Master Yin, it's been many days. How is the Ice Moon Hall?\"\n\nYin Dang gave a wry smile, \"Sect Leader, you're finally back. So many major events have happened on the continent over the past year. We dispatched a large number of personnel to find you, but there was no news. How could you...\"\n\nNian Bing raised his hand, stopping Yin Dang from continuing. Everyone sat down, and he unhesitatingly took the main seat. He swept his gaze over Feng Nü, Long Ling, and Lan Chen, signaling that he would explain to them later. Then, he turned to Yin Dang and said, \"I had some personal matters, and I rushed here as soon as I finished dealing with them.\"\n\nYin Dang said, \"Sect Leader, it's good that you're back. The sect needs you to preside over the situation.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"Briefly tell me what has happened in the sect during my absence.\"\n\nYin Dang respectfully replied, \"Shortly after you disappeared, we received a plea for help from the former Sect Leader. Since you were not here, the seven elders did not dare to act without authorization and dispatched people to search for your whereabouts everywhere. Our sect's eyes and ears are all over the continent, but we couldn't find you. Fearing that delaying important matters would be disastrous, the seven elders temporarily took charge of the sect's affairs and decided to assist Lord Demon Lion.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"So, that means our sect was also involved in the matter of the Qilu Empire.\"\n\nYin Dang said, \"Yes, the purpose of our sect's establishment is the Rong family. All information regarding the Qilu Empire was secretly provided to Lord Demon Lion by us. Even the final conquest of the Qilu Empire was made so smoothly because the seven elders led the Crimson Death Warriors to open the city gates from the inside. Now, most of our sect's personnel are concentrated in the south.\"\n\nNian Bing thought to himself, *As expected. Even though I was absent, the seven elders would not overlook any major decisions. With the comprehensive intelligence gathered by the Blood Lion Cult over the years, coupled with the surprise attack, how could the Qilu Empire not be defeated?*\n\nSeeing Nian Bing lost in thought, Yin Dang continued, \"Sect Leader, since you are back, please notify the elders immediately and ask you to preside over the situation.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Alright, you can notify the elders of my return first. Oh, right, what's the deal with that Four Nations Public Opinion Conference? I've only heard rumors. Since the Huarong Empire proposed such a conference, they must have some plans, right?\"\n\nYin Dang nodded, \"Yes, I only received the news not long ago. The so-called Four Nations Public Opinion Conference is actually a simple proposal for peace talks by the Huarong Empire.\"\n\nNian Bing was moved, \"Peace talks? In this situation, the Huarong Empire is willing to negotiate peace? What a clever strategy! However, will the Langmu Empire allow the peace talks to succeed? The Qilu Empire has just been occupied and needs time to fully control it. The territory of the Huarong Empire is now almost as large as the combined territories of the Aolan Empire and the Ice Moon Empire, at least one and a half times the size of the Langmu Empire. If they get a chance to recuperate, then what basis will the other countries have to compete with Huarong?\"\n\nYin Dang said, \"The situation of the Four Nations Public Opinion Conference is very delicate. According to the information our sect has obtained, in the upcoming conference, the Huarong Empire and the Langmu Empire will naturally be in a confrontational stance. The positions of the Aolan Empire and the Ice Moon Empire will be relatively delicate. The Huarong Empire needs time to recuperate, but the Aolan Empire needs even more time to adjust. The Ice Moon Empire has recently changed its king. Although most of the forces are under our control, its national strength is not necessarily strong. Moreover, due to the great distance from the Huarong Empire, if I were Yan Feng, I would not easily offend the Huarong Empire and invite a powerful enemy upon myself.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"Indeed, your analysis is very reasonable. I suppose this is also the reason why the Huarong Empire initiated peace talks. Balance and flexibility, this is indeed a good tactic! Considering the current situation of the Ice Moon Empire, there is no longer any need to occupy it; the entire high-ranking officials of the empire are almost all under our control.\"\n\nYin Dang nodded, \"That's right. After the last incident, the Snow Phantom Reserve Elder has become the father-in-law of the Ice Moon Empire's king and controls more than one-third of the empire's military power, holding immense authority. After deliberation by the elders of the Blood Lion Hall, Xue Po has now retired to the background, only controlling the military power but not easily interfering in court affairs, dedicating himself to assisting Yan Feng and allowing him to control the Ice Moon Empire on the surface.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes flashed, and he smiled, \"This is the best choice. Historically, powerful ministers have never had good endings. For us, the most important military power of the mages is in hand. As long as the military power is in hand, having Yan Feng manage the political aspects is not detrimental. Moreover, the court of the Ice Moon Empire has already been infiltrated by our people, and any situation is under our control. I must go and see this Four Nations Public Opinion Conference. The outcome is unpredictable. If I'm not mistaken, what the Huarong Empire wants to do is to display its strength to the other three countries to deter them, while the Langmu Empire wants to unite the other two countries to jointly resist the Huarong Empire. It's time for each country to compete in wisdom and strategy. Whoever gains more benefits at this conference will have a more comfortable time for a period in the future.\"\n\nYin Dang said, \"Sect Leader, what should our sect do?\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment, \"When you notify the seven elders of my return, tell them to lead the sect's elites to wait for me in the Huarong Empire. I will be going there soon. At the same time, order the sub-branches of our sect in various countries not to act rashly. Keep the intelligence network subdued and maintain the sect's mysteriousness, especially in the Huarong Empire.\"\n\nYin Dang was stunned for a moment, \"Sect Leader, why is that? Now is a good time for us to expand significantly!\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"Just do as I say. I have my reasons.\" The Huarong Empire's increased influence is naturally a good thing for the empire, but it may not be so for the Rong family. The Rong family is, after all, a subject of the Huarong Empire. Excessive achievements might not arouse the suspicion of Emperor Hua Tian, but if the throne changes hands in the future, or if Prince Rong passes away, the Rong family might not enjoy the same prestige, and changes might even occur. After all, the military power controlled by the Rong family is too vast. Those two terrifying knight orders alone are enough to make anyone wary. Therefore, the more mysterious the Blood Lion Cult remains, the greater its assistance to the Rong family will be in the future. How could Nian Bing easily explain these principles to Yin Dang? Because Yin Dang is not a member of the Rong family and is not yet considered a core member of the Blood Lion Cult.\n\nYin Dang respectfully agreed. Nian Bing continued, \"Arrange accommodations for my friends. I need to go out for a while later.\"\n\nYin Dang nodded in agreement. Suddenly, he seemed to remember something and said to Nian Bing, \"The Aolan Empire's recent actions are very strange. According to reports from our spies, for some reason, the Aolan Empire has undergone earth-shattering changes over the past two years. Especially with the encouragement of the royal family, all industries have developed significantly, and the entire country presents a scene of prosperity. Dozens of laws promulgated by the state have not contained a single error. In a state of poverty, taxes have been significantly reduced, and production has been encouraged. Although it has only been a little over two years, the Aolan Empire has fully recuperated and is no longer like it was before. However, they have not expanded their army. The army is still controlled by Duke Lan Yu, and they have even abandoned the defenses in the vast barren lands in the south, withdrawing to the inland areas. Except for the necessary daily training, the soldiers are engaged in other work, such as assisting farmers with cultivation, which is very strange. But the effect is surprisingly good. The entire country is undergoing adjustments and development. Although there are no visible changes from the outside, the internal situation of the Aolan Empire is vastly different from before.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred, \"For such a situation to occur, it must be related to the leadership. Only a wise monarch combined with wise ministers can enable the weakest country on the continent to develop in such a short time. Have there been any changes in the upper echelons of the Aolan Empire in the past two years?\"\n\nYin Dang nodded, \"Yes, and there has been a big change. With the recommendation of Duke Lan Yu, a person named Noel has become the new Prime Minister of the Aolan Empire. It was after this person ascended to a high position that the Aolan Empire made significant progress.\"\n\n\"Noel?\" Nian Bing's mind raced, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. \"I presume this Prime Minister Noel is not only very young but also a woman, right?\"\n\nYin Dang was surprised, \"Sect Leader, how did you know? This Prime Minister Noel is directly responsible to the Emperor of the Aolan Empire in the Aolan Imperial Palace and rarely appears before the emperor and his officials. The decrees are also issued by the emperor. We used a large number of personnel to discover that this Noel is a woman, but you...\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and looked at Long Ling, \"It seems your good sister has already begun to make great strides in the Aolan Empire.\"\n\nLong Ling looked at Nian Bing in surprise, \"Are you saying that this Noel is Rou'er?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"Exactly. Besides the Daughter of Wisdom, I can't imagine anyone else with such great ability to bring about such drastic changes in the Aolan Empire in such a short time. Well, although the King of the Aolan Empire may not be particularly wise, he definitely knows how to use people. No wonder Duke Lan Yu has always been highly valued by him. With Luo Rou now present, one civilian and one military, if they are given some time, I believe the Aolan Empire will surely achieve great things in the future! Feng Nü, you don't have to worry anymore. With the Daughter of Wisdom in the Aolan Empire, it won't be easy for the Huarong Empire to annex it.\"\n\nFeng Nü looked at Nian Bing doubtfully. She truly couldn't understand when this man she deeply loved had become a politician. Seeing his calm demeanor, it seemed as if he had already grasped the current situation.\n\nNian Bing stood up and said to Yin Dang, \"Notify the elders as I said first. I need to go out.\"\n\nYin Dang sincerely agreed and walked out. Nian Bing looked at Xi Lu and the three women and smiled, \"Now I can answer your questions. Do you have any questions? You can ask them now.\"\n\nFeng Nü spoke first, \"What's this about you being a Sect Leader? I've never heard you mention it before!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"You will all be my wives, so there's nothing to hide. Remember what happened when we participated in the competition in the Huarong Empire? I became the Sect Leader of the Blood Lion Cult at that time.\" He then briefly explained how his grandfather had passed the Blood Lion Cult to him and made him promise to protect the Rong family in the future.\n\nAfter listening to Nian Bing, Lan Chen suddenly realized, \"No wonder, no wonder you were in the imperial palace when the Ice Moon Empire's royal family had that disturbance. Yan Feng becoming emperor must have been your doing.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Of course. Even the experts who intercepted you halfway were sent by me. If everything wasn't under control, how could my good brother ascend to the throne? Actually, the real reason I did this was for Ling'er. Only when Yan Feng became emperor would there be no more obstacles between Ling'er and me. When I promised my master, Long Zhi, I had no confidence at all, but I had to agree for Ling'er. Later, when I discovered how vast the Blood Lion Cult's underground influence was, I gained confidence. With a meticulous plan, it was finally successful. Actually, it was very risky. If your master had arrived even a moment earlier, our regime-changing operation might have been sabotaged. Fortunately, it was successful in the end. These are all my secrets. You know everything else. Do you have any other questions?\"\n\nLong Ling smiled, \"I don't have any questions. I don't care who you are or what you control. Anyway, I will never leave you from now on.\"\n\nLan Chen sighed lightly, \"Nian Bing, after we first clashed, I was very unconvinced and always wanted a chance to defeat you. So, in the process of looking for you afterwards, I kept practicing diligently, hoping to get revenge when I saw you again. However, every time I saw you, you were stronger than before. You were facing not only me but so many other things. I have to admit, you are much more outstanding than me.\"\n\nNian Bing took Lan Chen's hand and smiled, \"If I were still inferior to you, you probably wouldn't acknowledge me as your husband, would you? Alright, don't overthink it. I will try my best to handle matters concerning your master. She imprisoned my parents for so many years, ruined my childhood, and destroyed my family. I must get revenge. But after all, she raised my mother and raised you. As long as my parents are safe, I promise you that I will spare her life in the end.\"",

    "title": "Chapter 186: Is it her that the Prime Minister of Orland? (Down)",
    "content": "Lan Chen’s eyes lit up, and ignoring the others around them, she lunged into Nian Bing's embrace, her voice trembling, \"Is what you said true?\" Though she had decided to leave the Ice God Tower, she could not simply forget the years of nurturing she had received from the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. The matter she feared most was one day having to go to the Ice God Tower with Nian Bing. It wasn't that she feared facing her master, but rather that she feared either her beloved man or her master getting hurt in a conflict between them. Nian Bing clearly understood her feelings. Giving her such a promise was a significant concession. After all, for Nian Bing, hatred had always been the source of his motivation and continuous effort. The only reason he said what he did was entirely for her! Thinking this, Lan Chen was overcome with emotion, wrapped her arms around Nian Bing’s neck, and kissed his lips with her own cold ones.\n\nNian Bing had been here for two days, but whenever the three women were with him, none of them dared to be too intimate, fearing misunderstandings from the other two. Lan Chen's sudden kiss startled Nian Bing, but his surprise was quickly replaced by tenderness. He held Lan Chen tightly and kissed her lips deeply, \"Don't worry, I've never broken a promise. Since I've agreed, I will definitely do it.\"\n\nLan Chen's eyes turned slightly red, and she lowered her head, saying, \"Thank you, thank you for understanding my feelings.\"\n\nNian Bing held her elastic, delicate body close, recalling their previous passionate encounter, and his heart warmed. He smiled, \"Alright, don't overthink it. You are my lover, and it's my duty to do things for you. Besides, this isn't a big deal!\" After visiting the Divine Continent, Nian Bing’s horizons had broadened considerably. Previously, on the Bright Continent, he had always believed that a God Descendant was his ultimate goal. But after visiting the Divine Continent, he realized how shallow his pursuit was. He would face many more challenges in the future, and those True Gods were the ones he should be confronting!\n\nLan Chen's heart gradually calmed in Nian Bing's warm embrace. Only then did she realize her current predicament and quickly broke free from his arms. A blush spread across her fair face, and she stole a glance at her elder sister, then at Long Ling.\n\nLong Ling and Feng Nü showed no change in their expressions; they were both smiling at her. Their gazes met Lan Chen's, which only made her feel more shy and embarrassed.\n\nNian Bing laughed heartily, \"Why are you looking at them? Don't worry, I won't play favorites. Come, my two wives, kiss each other.\" Saying this, he playfully pounced towards Feng Nü and Long Ling with a mock-threatening gesture.\n\nThe two women cried out in surprise and quickly dodged behind Lan Chen, but Nian Bing's physical strength was no match for his current self. Feng Nü successfully dodged him, but Long Ling fell into his grasp. Long Ling only struggled symbolically before Nian Bing had his way. Unlike Lan Chen’s cool lips, Long Ling’s lips were incredibly soft and moist, making the kiss exceptionally pleasant. When Nian Bing reached for Feng Nü again, Feng Nü shyly said, \"Didn't you say you had business to attend to? Hurry up, don't fool around in front of Brother Xi Lu. What would people think?\"\n\nXi Lu, who had been watching them with a simple-minded expression, quickly turned away upon hearing Feng Nü's words, muttering, \"I didn't see anything, I didn't see anything at all.\"\n\nNian Bing suddenly stepped forward like lightning and kissed Feng Nü’s burning lips deeply. \"Alright, the kiss is done. You two wait for me here. I'll be back shortly.\" With that, amidst Feng Nü's displeased hum, he hurried out of the conference room.\n\nWatching Nian Bing's retreating figure, Feng Nü couldn't help but shake her head helplessly, but her heart was filled with sweetness. She had been with Nian Bing the longest and clearly noticed that since their return, Nian Bing's mindset had changed significantly. At least he wasn't as gloomy as before; he had become much more cheerful. Perhaps it was because he had regained his life, and also because he knew his parents were safe.\n\nNian Bing left the Warrior's Guild, tidied his clothes, and slowly walked towards the palace. Before meeting Yin Dang, he had already guessed that the Blood Lion Church had assisted the Hua Rong Empire in their invasion, so Yin Dang's words didn't surprise him much. As he walked, he pondered the current situation on the Bright Continent. No matter how the Bright Continent fought amongst itself, it didn't have much impact on Nian Bing. He only hoped that his family and friends would not be harmed. As for who ruled the continent, it didn't matter much. His primary concern was the Lost Continent. He often analyzed in his mind what would happen if the Lost Continent returned or if the process of unsealing it was stopped.\n\nAfter staying in Kao for a year, the unlucky individuals dispatched from the Divine Continent had likely already arrived on the Bright Continent. He wondered if they had found Xie Yue's whereabouts. If these envoys, after witnessing so many prosperous scenes on the Bright Continent, were to spread the word upon their return to the Divine Continent, it was highly probable that the restrictive seals on the Divine Continent would be broken open within a certain period in the future. Although they were all humans, the influx of so many powerful individuals into the Bright Continent would certainly not be a good thing. But could he prevent that?\n\nHis initially good mood gradually disappeared as he thought. Nian Bing increasingly felt the gravity of the situation. Kao and Tian Xiang had entered seclusion when he left, and the other three True Gods would certainly not be idle. No one could predict what changes would occur in the future. If he wanted to change all this, he needed to become even more powerful and influential. It seemed preparations were also necessary on the Bright Continent. Even if the gods were powerful, they were far from comparable to the Bright Continent in terms of numbers. After this trip to the Hua Rong Empire, he should talk to his grandfather. He hoped they could come up with a countermeasure sooner rather than later.\n\nLost in thought, Nian Bing arrived in front of the Ice Moon Empire Palace. As he approached, he suddenly felt a chilling aura invading his body. Startled, he looked up in the direction of the aura. He saw three mages, dressed in white magic robes, looking at him. These three individuals were also heading towards the Ice Moon Empire Palace.\n\nUpon seeing them, Nian Bing's heart skipped a beat because the person wearing the veiled gauze was none other than the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess! The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's attire was no different from before, except she now wore a white bamboo hat, with three feet of white gauze hanging down, concealing her peerless beauty. The two behind her were dressed similarly to the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, but their aura was much weaker.\n\nAlthough he couldn't see the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's face, with Nian Bing's spiritual power, he instantly determined that she was his great enemy. Taking a deep breath, his eyes shone brightly, and he walked towards her proactively.\n\nThe reason the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess noticed Nian Bing before he noticed her was not because her spiritual power was stronger than his, but because Nian Bing had been somewhat distracted in his thoughts and hadn't paid attention to his surroundings.\n\nWhen the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess saw Nian Bing approaching, she was somewhat surprised. Lan Chen, when she was still Bing Yun, had told her about Nian Bing's identity. Looking at Nian Bing's seemingly familiar handsome face, she couldn't help but think of her disciple, and also of the stubborn Rong Tian. On the surface, the young man in the golden magic robe appeared more outstanding than his father. But strangely, although he was clearly a mage, why was there no trace of magical elements around his body?\n\n\"What wind brings the esteemed Ice Snow Goddess Priestess to Ice Moon City? Royal Court Mage Nian Bing pays his respects.\" Nian Bing's voice was calm. Although his heart was turbulent, after enduring countless trials, his spiritual power had reached a new realm. His inner thoughts would not affect the changes in his aura.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said coldly, \"You are Nian Bing. Rong Nian Bing?\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes flashed, and he said, \"Since you already know, why do you ask?\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess nodded. \"You have a lot of courage. To dare speak to me like this.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, retorting, \"We are all human, we all have mouths. Besides eating, what are mouths for if not for speaking? Do your mouths only pass gas?\"\n\nAlthough separated by a veil, as soon as Nian Bing finished speaking, he could feel two exceptionally cold gazes shooting from behind the white gauze. \"Do you think I dare not kill you here?\" the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's voice grew even colder.\n\n\"You dare. Of course, you dare. As the only God Descendant on the continent, what is there that you dare not do? However, if I recall correctly, the Ice God Tower's supplies are all provided by the Ice Moon Empire, aren't they? I am under orders from the Ice Moon Empire's royal family, after all. Killing me here in front of the palace gates, I'm afraid, would not look good.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess snorted. \"Your father was not as glib-tongued as you. At least he was a gentleman.\"\n\nHearing the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess mention his father, Nian Bing's eyes lit up, and he said coldly, \"A gentleman? Since you consider my father a gentleman, why did you harm him and my mother? You should know that the hatred between us cannot be resolved. Don't worry, I won't run away. The matter between us will be settled someday, just not now. Whether you can retrieve the Ice Snow Goddess Stone depends on your ability.\"\n\nTwo cold lights instantly shot from the hands of the two mages behind the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, directly at Nian Bing's vital chest area. As disciples of the Ice God Tower, hearing Nian Bing insult the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, they could not maintain the same composure as she did and immediately attacked Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing smiled indifferently. He didn't show the slightest panic due to the attack. He didn't even move, allowing the two highly condensed ice element ice cones to strike his body. He didn't even use magic to defend himself. His chest flashed slightly, and the two ice cones turned into ice dust.\n\nLooking at the two holes left on his golden magic robe, Nian Bing said calmly, \"Priestess, I believe you should compensate me for a piece of clothing.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess was also very surprised. The two ice mages accompanying her to Ice Moon City this time were her trusted subordinates of many years, both having reached the level of Ice Archmage. Although it was a split-second ice cone attack, it was by no means something an ordinary ice mage could achieve. Yet Nian Bing blocked the attack with just his physical strength without even using magic. What was going on? Did he also cultivate martial arts? Unable to sense Nian Bing's aura, she found him increasingly mysterious.\n\nNian Bing gave the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess a deep look. It wasn't that he didn't want to act immediately, nor was it that he lacked confidence. However, since he had promised Feng Nü that he would handle the matters of the Oulan Empire first, now was not the time to create more trouble. Moreover, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess was always a symbol of the Ice Moon Empire. If he were to rashly engage her, it would be difficult to explain to Yan Feng.\n\n\"Why has the Priestess fallen silent? Is she at a loss for words? Since we are already here, let's go in. You should also be here to see His Majesty.\" Saying this, Nian Bing ignored the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess and turned to walk towards the palace.\n\n\"Priestess, he is so arrogant. What do you think...\" an Ice Archmage whispered to the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said calmly, \"Now is not the time to act. You must remember, as an Ice Archmage, you must remain calm when facing an enemy. Only then can you find the enemy's weakness and strike decisively. Your magic is already very powerful. Have years of cultivation not tempered your temper?\"\n\nThe two Ice Archmages replied fearfully, \"Yes, Priestess.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess raised her foot and walked into the palace. \"Let's go in too.\"\n\nRelying on the golden token previously granted by Yan Feng, Nian Bing entered the palace interior without any obstruction. It was currently the time when Yan Feng was holding court. He arrived outside the Ice God Hall of the Ice Moon Empire Palace and ordered a messenger to announce his arrival.\n\nYan Feng was discussing the matter of the Four Nations Grand Assembly with the ministers of the Ice Moon Empire. Ever since receiving the invitation from the Hua Rong Empire, he had been in a dilemma. He had been on the throne for some time and had gradually adapted to his current life. His inherent talent was gradually manifesting, and he had solidified his position as emperor. However, this matter was truly tricky. He did not wish to offend the Hua Rong Empire, but he also did not wish to offend the Lang Mu Empire. Currently, the envoys from both countries were in Ice Moon City.",

    "content": "Envoys from the Rong Empire<sup>1</sup> had come to invite him to send representatives to a conference, while envoys from the Langmu Empire<sup>2</sup> were requesting cooperation. For a moment, he didn't know what to do. His decision would represent the Ice Moon Empire's<sup>3</sup> stance, and he couldn't afford to be hasty. In fact, he had been discussing it with his ministers for three days, yet no conclusion had been reached. With the conference start time drawing near, he would miss it if he didn't depart soon, so he was extremely anxious, having not slept soundly for days.\n\n\"Reporting to Your Majesty, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess has arrived, and the Chief Court Magician Nian Bing has arrived.\" The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's status was extraordinary, and her name always came first, even when mentioned alongside Yan Feng's.\n\nYan Feng suddenly stood up from his throne, his eyes filled with surprise. He wasn't surprised by the arrival of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, as he had sent someone to the Ice God Tower to invite her. For such an important matter as the Four Nations Consensus Conference<sup>4</sup>, he had to seek the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's opinion. Moreover, in his mind, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess was the ideal candidate for an envoy. With the continent's foremost Divine Descendant<sup>5</sup> present, Ice Moon could certainly secure the greatest benefits. However, upon hearing that Nian Bing had also arrived, his heart was immediately filled with excitement. He knew that while Marshal Xue Po<sup>6</sup> had played the biggest role in his ascending the throne, Nian Bing was the one he trusted the most in his heart. Without Nian Bing's perfect strategy, it would have been impossible to succeed. He considered Nian Bing a brother, and Nian Bing's timely arrival at this critical juncture meant one more person to consult with. How could he not be happy?\n\n\"Quick, invite them in. Oh, no, I'll go personally to greet them.\" As he spoke, he lifted the hem of his dragon robe and walked down the throne steps. The ministers parted to the sides, and Marshal Xue Po, with an equally surprised expression, followed Yan Feng outside to greet them.\n\nThe doors of the Ice God Hall opened. At the entrance stood the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess and Nian Bing. The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had removed her hat, revealing her ageless, stunning beauty. Seeing Yan Feng, the current King of the Ice Moon Empire, emerge first as the doors opened, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess was greatly surprised, and the originally stern light in her eyes softened. She frowned and said, \"Why has Your Majesty come out personally?\"\n\nYan Feng smiled and said, \"The timely arrival of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess is a blessing to my Ice Moon Empire. How could I not come to greet her personally? Priestess, please come inside.\" With that, he made way and gestured for her to enter.\n\nNian Bing secretly praised him. Yan Feng seemed more mature than before. For someone of his current status, achieving this was not easy. The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess was already proud, and being praised by him would surely make her feel much better.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess did not refuse, and with her two subordinates, she strode in confidently. Nian Bing followed behind them, walking into the main hall. Only then did Yan Feng have the opportunity to look at Nian Bing, his excitement uncontainable. He winked at Nian Bing, and then walked side-by-side with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess.\n\nYan Feng ordered two chairs to be brought and placed on either side of his throne. He said, \"Priestess, please sit. Nian Bing, you may sit too.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's gaze turned cold again as she looked at Nian Bing and said sternly, \"What qualifications does he have to sit here?\"\n\nYan Feng frowned slightly and said, \"Nian Bing is our country's Chief Court Magician, holding a guest minister status. He is naturally qualified to sit.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess snorted coldly and said, \"His status is probably questionable. If someone of his caliber can sit, then my subordinates can sit as well. To sit in this hall, one needs to prove themselves through strength.\"\n\nNian Bing did not get angry and said with a faint smile, \"Oh? Then how do you think I can sit here, Priestess?\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said, \"Strength is the basis for speaking.\"\n\nNian Bing said with a hint of amusement, \"Do you intend to fight me in the hall?\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said disdainfully, \"You are not worthy of fighting me. As long as you can defeat either of my subordinates, you will have the qualification to sit here.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"This is not a difficult matter.\"\n\nYan Feng looked at Nian Bing, then at the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, and said sincerely, \"Both of you are pillars of this country. Please do not conflict.\" It would be a joke if such high-level magicians like Nian Bing were to fight; the destructive power alone could easily turn this place into ruins.\n\nNian Bing looked at Yan Feng and said, \"Your Majesty, I have traveled a long distance and am a bit tired. Naturally, I wish to sit. Since the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess doubts my status, I will prove myself to her. Your Majesty, please rest assured, I will not damage anything here. Otherwise, I will voluntarily resign from my current position.\"\n\nYan Feng was greatly anxious. \"Nian Bing, don't be rude.\" After all, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had long-standing authority, and he favored Nian Bing, fearing he would suffer a disadvantage.\n\nNian Bing looked at the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess and said, \"Priestess, please have your subordinates prepare. I shall begin.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had only spoken provocatively to avenge Nian Bing's earlier insult. She hadn't expected him to actually dare to act here and was momentarily stunned. In that instant, it happened. Red and blue light flashed almost simultaneously, and the entire hall was suddenly filled with a sharp aura. Two diametrically opposed lights of ice and heat shot out from Nian Bing's body to the sides, drawing an arc in the air, bypassing the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess in front, and flashing towards the two ice mages.\n\nThe two mages reacted quickly, blocking the incoming light with ice shields. As mages themselves, they naturally assumed this sudden attack would be ineffective, so they didn't take Nian Bing seriously. However, they were mistaken. Nian Bing could no longer be measured by ordinary mage standards.\n\nThe red and blue lights instantly enlarged, and two tall, slender figures appeared in the air. The dark red True Sun Blade<sup>7</sup> flickered with blue True Fire, shattering the ice shields in almost an instant. On the other side, the blue Morning Dew Blade<sup>8</sup> broke through the ice shield with sheer force, turning it into powder. Their auras were instantly locked. The moment the two mages' hands touched their magic scrolls, they were immobilized by the ice and fire puppet clones. They were not incapable of moving, but as mages, they knew very well that any slight movement would cause the locking magic power to instantly explode and tear them to shreds. Feeling the scorching heat of the True Sun Blade and the icy cold of the Morning Dew Blade, the faces of the two ice mages changed.\n\nThe sudden change immediately caused a stir in the Ice God Hall. No one clearly saw what happened, but the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's two subordinates were already incapacitated.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's heart turned cold. She was very close to Nian Bing and felt it most deeply. Even she was not confident she could fully withstand that sharp energy; only by evading could she avoid such an instantaneous attack. Nian Bing still stood there with a smile, as if he had done nothing, but the lives of the two mages were already in his hands. The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had to re-evaluate the strength of the young man before her.\n\nThe light receded. Two puppet clones, along with two divine blades, merged into Nian Bing's body and disappeared. \"I believe I now have the right to sit here, Priestess. I just want to tell you that my position as Chief Court Magician was not obtained through connections.\" As he spoke, Nian Bing took his seat openly, not glancing at the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess again.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess did not change expression and also sat down. Her two subordinates behind her wanted to speak, but she stopped them with a raised hand. Seeing this, Yan Feng quickly said, \"Both of you are my guest ministers. There is no need to argue over a small matter. Alright, let us continue discussing official business. Priestess, the Four Nations Consensus Conference is about to be held. I have clearly stated in my letter to you. What do you think, how should our country face it? The Rong Empire is powerful, and if we do not handle it properly, it will be very unfavorable to our country's future development.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said indifferently, \"I don't understand political matters, Your Majesty need not ask me.\"\n\nYan Feng was rebuffed but did not show any displeasure. He continued, \"Currently, our country is outside the war zone and temporarily has no worries of war. However, the Langmu Empire borders our country. Because we are located in the north and the climate is harsh, a large portion of our grain supply comes from Langmu. Now they are sending people to request an alliance. If we refuse, it may not be appropriate. But if we join forces with the Rong Empire to advance, the long march, coupled with the Rong Empire's power and the fact that they do not border us, regardless of victory or defeat, the benefits to us would be extremely small. Therefore, my ministers and I are in a dilemma and wish to hear your opinion.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess glanced at Yan Feng, seeing the sincere gaze in his eyes. She said slowly, \"There is nothing wrong with forming an alliance. Ice Moon has always been on good terms with Oran<sup>9</sup>. The Langmu Empire can be considered Ice Moon's granary. As for sending troops, I don't think it's necessary. The Rong Empire is not so easy to deal with. We must attend the Four Nations Consensus Conference, and Your Majesty can decide the specifics. If the Ice God Tower's assistance is needed, I will naturally provide it to the best of my ability.\"\n\nThese last words, \"to the best of my ability,\" immediately angered Yan Feng. His face stiffened slightly, and he thought to himself, Ice Moon Empire had given so much support to the Ice God Tower before, and the Ice God Tower had always helped the Ice Moon Empire. Now, when there was something to be done, they offered \"to the best of my ability\"? But now was not the time to act out, as she was needed. Thinking this, Yan Feng said, \"Priestess, to attend this Four Nations Consensus Conference, we must send an envoy who is highly respected and has deterrent power to represent me. After much consideration, I believe it would be best for you to go personally. What do you think...\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess raised her hand, stopping Yan Feng from speaking further, and shook her head. \"No, I will not go to the Rong Empire. Perhaps Your Majesty is unaware, but our Ice God Tower and the Rong family of the Rong Empire have always been rivals. If I go, not only will I not help the empire, but it might even have the opposite effect. Moreover, with the rise of the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild<sup>10</sup>, it would be better to have them send experts to assist Your Majesty's envoy.\"\n\nYan Feng immediately understood. While much of what the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said was true, she was by no means afraid of the Rong family. The reason she was unwilling to contribute to the empire was partly because the rise of the Mage Guild affected the status of the Ice God Tower. It seemed it was time for him to state his position. Although the Mage Guild had developed rapidly in the past two years, it was not significantly far behind the Ice God Tower, and there were still many areas where they relied on the Ice God Tower. Weighing the pros and cons, just as Yan Feng was about to speak, Nian Bing, sitting on his other side, spoke.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I agree with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. It is indeed not advisable for the Ice God Tower to represent us at the Four Nations Consensus Conference in the Rong Empire. Since the Priestess also agrees to have the Mage Guild assist the envoy in attending this conference, I, as the Vice President of the Mage Guild, request to undertake this task.\"\n\nYan Feng looked at Nian Bing with some surprise. Nian Bing nodded at him firmly. If Yan Feng had some hesitation before, seeing Nian Bing's gaze made him resolute. Nian Bing was the person he trusted the most. Without Nian Bing, he would not have his throne. What else was there to doubt? \"Good, since both the Priestess and Nian Bing believe this, then it is settled. However, the choice of envoy is of great importance. Which of my esteemed officials is willing to go?\"\n\nSilence fell upon the court. This responsibility was too great. No one knew the current situation in the Rong Empire, and what changes might occur were still unknown. The ministers were all cunning, and who would be willing to undertake such a thankless task?\n\nSeeing the ministers' silence, Yan Feng couldn't help but be slightly angered. \"What, is no one willing to share my worries?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty, let me go,\" Nian Bing stood up from his seat.\n\n\"You?\" Yan Feng looked at Nian Bing with some doubt. It wasn't that he didn't believe in Nian Bing's strength. The strategy Nian Bing had helped him plan to ascend the throne had greatly impressed him. If Nian Bing hadn't firmly refused, Yan Feng would have made him hold a high position. However, the danger of this Four Nations Consensus Conference was too great, and he truly didn't want Nian Bing to be put at risk.\n\nNian Bing said, \"This subject is willing to share Your Majesty's worries.\"\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's cold voice rang out. \"Magician Nian Bing absolutely cannot undertake this task. Not to mention whether he has the political ability, but his identity alone is not suitable to represent the empire as an envoy.\"\n\nYan Feng was startled and said, \"Identity? What identity does Nian Bing have?\" He was actually asking a rhetorical question. Nian Bing had already told him about his origins from the Rong family back then. Of course, Nian Bing had only told him that he came from the Rong family and also informed him that he had already left the Rong family due to his father's relationship.\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> **Rong Empire:** Translates to 華融帝國 (Huáróng Dìguó).\n<sup>2</sup> **Langmu Empire:** Translates to 朗木帝國 (Lǎngmù Dìguó).\n<sup>3</sup> **Ice Moon Empire:** Translates to 冰月帝國 (Bīngyuè Dìguó).\n<sup>4</sup> **Four Nations Consensus Conference:** Translates to 四國公論大會 (Sìguó Gōnglùn Dàhuì).\n<sup>5</sup> **Divine Descendant:** Translates to 神降師 (Shénjiàngshī).\n<sup>6</sup> **Marshal Xue Po:** Translates to 雪魄元帥 (Xuěpò Yuánshuài).\n<sup>7</sup> **True Sun Blade:** Translates to 正陽刀 (Zhèngyáng Dāo).\n<sup>8</sup> **Morning Dew Blade:** Translates to 晨露刀 (Chénlù Dāo).\n<sup>9</sup> **Oran:** Translates to 奧蘭 (Àolán).

    "content": "The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said calmly, \"His name should be Rong Nianbing, right?\"\n\nAs soon as she said this, the officials below the stage were in an uproar, and many people looked at Nianbing differently.\n\nNianbing smiled slightly, without any panic, \"Yes, I am indeed from the Rong family, and Prince Rong is my grandfather. However, I have long stopped using the surname Rong. Since my father rebelled and left the Rong family, and was then harmed by you, Priestess of the Ice Snow Goddess, I have been an orphan. Having grown up in the Ice Moon Empire, I only know loyalty to the country that raised me.\"\n\nBelow the stage, Xue Po walked out and said respectfully, \"Your Majesty, I believe Mage Nianbing is competent for this important task. I trust his character. I have also heard of Mage Nianbing's identity, and he has indeed long since separated from the Rong family.\" As he spoke, he reached up and touched the silver embroidery on his collar.\n\nAs soon as Xue Po finished speaking, dozens of ministers immediately stepped forward and said in unison, \"We also believe that Mage Nianbing is competent for this important task.\" Their voices were so synchronized that even Yan Feng was startled. Little did he know that these ministers, who held important positions, were all members of the Blood Lion Cult, and Xue Po's action just now was the secret signal of the Blood Lion Cult. Most of these members of the Blood Lion Cult did not know Nianbing's identity, but when the signal appeared, they immediately voiced their agreement with Xue Po's suggestion.\n\nThose who could speak out carried significant weight in the Ice Moon Empire, and those ministers who felt it was inappropriate did not dare to speak rashly again. On the stage, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess showed surprise in her eyes for the first time. She glanced at the calm Nianbing and said coldly, \"Your Majesty, since so many people support Mage Nianbing, then you should appoint him as the envoy. However, my Ice God Tower has benefited from the empire's grace for many years. When the empire has matters, we cannot stand idly by. I will accompany Mage Nianbing on this trip.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Marshal Xue Po below the stage could not help but change his expression, and he looked up at Nianbing. Nianbing still had a smile on his face. He said, \"That's great! With the Priestess changing her mind and being willing to travel with me, I will surely learn a lot. With your deterrence, I believe our country can strive for the best interests.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess suddenly changed her decision out of necessity. Although she did not value material possessions, the Ice God Tower was built by her. The Ice God Tower had never engaged in any business and had enormous expenses due to the need for master-level magic crystals. The north was the most suitable place for ice mages to cultivate. Without royal support, it would have a great impact on the Ice God Tower. To gain royal support, one must have sufficient status. Now that the Mage Guild was rising, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had come in person this time, intending to exert herself for the Ice Moon Empire to prove herself as the guardian deity of the Ice Moon Empire. She did not expect Nianbing to accept the position of envoy so readily, putting her at a disadvantage. In helplessness, she had to request to go together.\n\nAlthough Yan Feng felt something was amiss, since Nianbing and the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had already made up their minds, he could not make any further changes. Thus, he appointed Nianbing as the envoy, with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess accompanying him. The accompanying personnel were to be chosen by the two of them. They would depart tomorrow. After that, some specific details were discussed in the hall, and then the court was dismissed.\n\nAfter the court was dismissed, Yan Feng directly took Nianbing and Marshal Xue Po back to his sleeping quarters. He dismissed the attendants and then grabbed Nianbing's shoulder. \"You brat, where have you been these past few days? I couldn't find you, and it was killing me with worry.\"\n\nLooking at Yan Feng's genuine emotion, Nianbing smiled slightly and said, \"Aren't I back to help you?\"\n\nYan Feng playfully punched Nianbing on the shoulder and said, \"You're too impulsive, kid. Why are you arguing with that old hag, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess? Just let her go. Why do you have to get involved in this mess?\"\n\nNianbing smiled and said, \"As your Chief Court Mage, I must do my best for you. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.\"\n\nXue Po, standing beside them, said, \"But the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess is traveling with you this time, and she is your enemy, I'm afraid...\"\n\nNianbing shook his head and said, \"I know what's important. I am now an envoy representing the empire, and she won't do anything to me. When the time comes for us to settle our scores, I will naturally settle them with her.\"\n\nYan Feng said, \"Nianbing, what do you think we should do now?\"\n\nNianbing said, \"We must form an alliance with the Olan Empire and the Langmu Empire. This is essential. However, there is no need to go to war with the Huarong Empire. If this balance is maintained well, it will be beneficial and harmless to our country. What Your Majesty needs to do now is to vigorously develop our country. Only by becoming strong ourselves can we better control our destiny.\"\n\nYan Feng nodded and smiled, \"It's quite fitting for you to be this envoy. You are one of the people I truly trust!\"\n\nA strange look flashed in Xue Po's eyes, and Nianbing pretended not to see it, continuing, \"Alright, since Your Majesty trusts me, let me handle this matter entirely. I am confident.\"\n\nYan Feng smiled and said, \"Of course I trust you. You would never harm me. You proved this when you helped me ascend to the throne. Alright, since you're finally back, you must stay for lunch. This trip to Huarong is not without risks, and I will definitely send some experts with you.\"\n\nNianbing shook his head and said, \"That's not necessary. With the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess and me present, who would dare to challenge us? Although I dislike her intensely, I must admit that there are very few people on the Yangguang Continent who can defeat her. As for lunch, I want to properly savor the skills of the imperial chef.\"\n\nYan Feng laughed heartily and said, \"I wanted to savor your cooking, but since you're finally back, you must be tired. Let's just make do with something today.\" In front of Nianbing, he did not have any airs of a monarch at all.\n\nNianbing stayed in the imperial palace until the afternoon before leaving with Xue Po.\n\n\"Sect Master, how can you be this envoy?\" Xue Po asked Nianbing in a low voice as they walked.\n\nNianbing smiled faintly and said, \"Why? Why can't I be this envoy? Our sect's goal is to assist the Rong family, not to assist the Huarong Empire. Elder Xue, please don't forget this point.\"\n\nXue Po's body trembled, \"Sect Master, what do you mean?\"\n\nNianbing said, \"From now on, you will also be one of the elders of this sect. There are some things I don't need to hide from you. Firstly, the Rong family is currently at the height of its power in the Huarong Empire due to their annexation of the Qilu Empire. However, if the Huarong Empire truly annexes all four countries and unifies the entire continent, it will not benefit our Rong family at all. My view on this differs from my grandfather's. My grandfather's wish is to unify the continent. However, once the continent is truly unified, the Rong family may very well walk towards destruction.\"\n\nA flash of sharp light appeared in Xue Po's eyes, \"Sect Master means 'when the cunning rabbit is dead, the hunting dog is cooked'?\"\n\nNianbing said coldly, \"When the flying birds are gone, the good bow is put away; when the cunning rabbit is dead, the hunting dog is cooked. This has always been an undeniable truth throughout history. The Rong family's merits are too great, and they have overshadowed the ruler. Once the Huarong Empire changes its ruler, within three generations, the Rong family is bound to perish. However, the Rong family has many experts. If the continent is not unified, in order to utilize the Rong family's influence, the Huarong Empire will inevitably have to court the Rong family, and the Rong family's status will be difficult to change. Moreover, for us, the Blood Lion Cult, do you think it is better for the continent to be unified, or to control other countries secretly? After the continent is unified, underground forces can still survive, but as long as the ruler of the Huarong Empire is not an idiot, they will definitely find ways to control underground forces. Although our Blood Lion Cult is mysterious, I believe the Huarong Empire probably already has some files on us. Therefore, our future direction of development is not to help Huarong unify the continent, but to control the Olan Empire and the Langmu Empire after the Ice Moon Empire, as this is the correct path. Only by completely whitewashing our people can we have better development in the future.\"\n\nListening to Nianbing's explanation, Xue Po nodded repeatedly, \"Sect Master's foresight is indeed extraordinary. After your analysis, your subordinate understands much more.\"\n\nNianbing sighed lightly and said, \"Actually, I am not very suitable to be the sect master, because I am too prone to acting on emotion, which is my biggest flaw. However, if a person has no emotions, then they are not worthy of being called a human. Elder Xue, to be honest, Yan Feng has always treated me as his best brother. We are using him to control the Ice Moon Empire, and I always feel somewhat guilty towards him. Therefore, I want to help him. Moreover, your daughter is his wife. Whether it is for Yan Feng or for her, we cannot let the Ice Moon Empire perish. Therefore, my coming to the imperial court today is to become the envoy of the Ice Moon Empire. I am rushing to help Yan Feng. I hope you can understand my good intentions. Although our sect members are distributed in various regions, most of them have taken root. If there are major changes, it will involve too many people. Should these sect members who hold high positions abandon everything they have? To develop better, we must consider the future paths of our subordinates. Only in this way can our sect survive in the darkness forever and control the entire continent.\"\n\nXue Po looked at Nianbing deeply, \"Sect Master, I...\"\n\nNianbing smiled slightly and said, \"This is my thought. Since I have become the sect master, I must consider the brothers in the sect. It is time for the Blood Lion Cult's policy to change. When we arrive at the Huarong Empire, I will naturally have a good talk with the seven elders. Although we exist for the Rong family, to better help the Rong family, we must make changes.\"\n\nXue Po nodded respectfully, \"I understand. Now I truly recognize the vision of the Lion King, Sect Master. You are indeed more suited for this position of sect master!\"\n\nNianbing parted ways with Xue Po on the road and returned to the Warrior Guild alone.\n\n\"What?\" Lan Chen stared at Nianbing with wide eyes. \"You said Master wants to travel with us? This, how can this be?\" After hearing what Nianbing had done outside, Lan Chen was immediately in a panic. She really did not want to face her master!\n\nNianbing smiled slightly and said, \"It's nothing. I've already thought it through for you. You don't necessarily have to face your master! Your Ice God Tower people travel by carriage, so we'll travel by carriage too. You have the Heavenly Eye Aperture now, so concealing your aura should be fine. Your master won't be able to detect it at all. Moreover, have you seen Brother Xi Lu's appearance? I have a way to change his appearance, so I can naturally change yours. Would you like to try it first?\"\n\n\"But...\" Lan Chen was still hesitant.\n\nNianbing smiled and said, \"Don't worry, Chenchen, I know what I'm doing. I have a lot to do on this trip to the Huarong Empire. If I remember correctly, the Phoenix tribe's ceremony is also about to begin. After dealing with this Four Nations Public Opinion Conference, I will accompany you to the Phoenix tribe. Although Mother has left the Phoenix tribe, I understand her heart.\"\n\nFeng Nu's beautiful eyes flickered with light, and she proactively took Nianbing's hand. \"You're still the most thoughtful. Chenchen, don't worry. Even if your master travels with us, she won't be able to do anything. With our combined strength, she won't be able to do anything to you.\"\n\nLan Chen lowered her head and said, \"Master raised me since I was young. Although she was equally strict with me, she was very good to me. I left the Ice God Tower for Nianbing, but I really don't want to go against Master. I don't even know how to face her.\"\n\nNianbing hugged Lan Chen and said, \"There's no other way. I didn't expect her to proactively ask to travel with us to the Huarong Empire today either. Don't worry, out of sight, out of mind. If it's really impossible, you can wait for us here.\"\n\nLan Chen shook her head vigorously and said, \"No, I've already waited for you for a year and a half. Are you going to make me wait any longer? I'll do as you say, but when you change my appearance, make it beautiful. I don't want to be ugly.\"\n\nNianbing laughed heartily and said, \"My Chenchen is so beautiful, how could I make you look ugly? You belong to the ice element, so let's use my 'Sigh of the Ice Snow Goddess.' It's most suitable for you. With its aura temporarily merged with yours, it will also be very beneficial for your strength improvement.\"\n\nLan Chen said, \"Do you have to use your sword? That's your most handy weapon. If you give it to me, what will you use? If Master attacks you, you might not be able to resist!\"\n\nNianbing smiled and said, \"Don't worry, it's fine. I can recall the sword at any time. Moreover, Brother Xi Lu is here, so your master won't have any chance to harm me. As an envoy, at most she will make a probing attack, but she won't truly try to kill me. Besides, I'm not necessarily afraid of her.\"",

    "content": "The next morning, after arranging matters with the Blood Lion Sect, Nian Bing, along with the official documents and tokens Yan Feng had given him, set off for the Huá Róng Empire with two carriages. In the two luxurious carriages were Nian Bing and his four companions, along with the Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess and her two subordinates. The carriages were the best equipment from the Ice Moon Empire, each pulled by four strong, high-level warhorses, allowing for extremely rapid progress. The Four Nations Grand Assembly was not far off, so they had to travel at full speed.\n\nAs for the envoy from the Långmù Empire, at Nian Bing's suggestion, Yan Feng had agreed to form an alliance with the Långmù Empire.\n\nThe carriages sped along the official road. Nian Bing used his mental power to cast a seal on the carriage he was in, making it impossible for anyone below the level of Life God Ka'ao to detect what was happening inside. He was in a state of great comfort, with a beauty in each arm and another beside him, experiencing unspeakable pleasure.\n\nXí Lǔ was indeed dull-witted; beauties held little attraction for him. He sat in the corner of the carriage, eyes closed in cultivation. Occasionally, when he awoke, he would simply look at the scenery outside, not disturbing Nian Bing and the others. Since arriving on the Yangguang Continent, Xí Lǔ had become truly enamored with the landscape. He was very interested in everything around him, and with Nian Bing's guidance, he was gradually becoming familiar with this continent.\n\n\"Bing, can Master really not sense us?\" Lan Chen asked Nian Bing with a hint of worry.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Of course, he can't. Don't you trust my mental power? Speaking of which, if the four of us were to go to the Divine Continent, we would probably cause a sensation, with four people who have opened the Heavenly Eye acupoint appearing at once. Remember this: the growth of mental power is almost limitless. While the human physical body has great potential, it ultimately has its limits. If you want to enhance your strength, the cultivation of mental power must not cease.\" He held no reservations with his women. He had told them how he cultivated his mental power long ago, on that night in the Dragon Cave on their first day back.\n\nThe carriages continued to gallop onward. The Ice Moon Empire was very far from the Huá Róng Empire. Nian Bing estimated that even with the fast carriages, it would take over ten days to reach the Huá Róng Empire's territory. He didn't want to cultivate during these ten-odd days. Having finally returned, what he wanted most was to be with his beloved women. However, one thing was bothering him. Despite having three beautiful women by his side, they were all quite shy and refused to let Nian Bing be too intimate, which was truly unbearable for the now \"enlightened\" Nian Bing. But out of respect for the three women, he could only endure it.\n\nLong Ling leaned on Nian Bing's right shoulder, while Feng Nü sat beside him, holding his hand. Lan Chen, having already been intimate with Nian Bing, was less shy than the other two and was resting her head on Nian Bing's lap. Although the road was not very smooth, the quality of the luxurious carriages was excellent, filtering out most of the jolting. It was warm and comfortable, and the food prepared in the hidden compartments was enough for them to eat for over ten days.\n\nThe first day after leaving the Ice Moon Empire ended with constant travel. As night fell, Nian Bing ordered the carriages to stop and rest by the roadside. Due to the urgent timeline, Nian Bing had decided not to stay in any cities when they left. They would rest wherever the carriages reached. After all, the carriages were spacious enough to accommodate them.\n\nHe jumped out of the carriage and stretched his body. Nian Bing glanced at the carriage following behind. He saw that the Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess had also alighted from her carriage and was looking at him.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"High Priestess, are you accustomed to sitting in carriages all day?\" His years of experience had made him much more suave. The hatred in his heart had also somewhat lessened now that his parents were still alive, and he handled any situation more smoothly than before.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess said calmly, \"There's no such thing as accustomed or unaccustomed. I prefer a monotonous life. Nian Bing, follow me.\" Saying this, she turned and walked towards the forest.\n\nFeng Nü and the others also alighted from the carriage. Under the effect of the Morning Dew Blade, Lan Chen's appearance had changed drastically. Nian Bing had transformed her into a look similar to Wise Woman Luo Rou. Although not as beautiful as her original appearance, it was enough to satisfy her. As soon as they got out of the carriage, they heard the Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess's words, and their expressions changed simultaneously. Lan Chen anxiously said, \"Bing, don't go.\"\n\nNian Bing waved his hand and said, \"It's okay, you wait for me here. Trust me, I'll be fine.\"\n\nXí Lǔ said, \"Brother, why don't I go with you? That woman has a dangerous aura about her.\" He was very sensitive to power. Feng Nü and the other two didn't know how powerful Xí Lǔ was and insisted on going with Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"I told you, she won't do anything to me, and I'm not afraid of her. You all wait for me here, no one needs to go. How about this, if you're worried, I'll put away two of the swords first. With seven divine swords in hand, it's hard to die.\" After saying this, he shrugged, making a comical gesture that eased the tense atmosphere a bit.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess walked into the forest for a hundred zhang before stopping. No, she seemed to float rather than walk. Her white magic robe accentuated her cold features, making her appear like an ice fairy. If Nian Bing didn't know her age, he might have been smitten. After all, apart from perfect beauties like Ka'ao and Tian Xiang, the Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. Bing Yun looked somewhat similar to her, but lacked her sacred aura.\n\n\"High Priestess, you summoned me. May I ask why?\" Nian Bing asked with a smile.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess looked at Nian Bing coldly and said, \"You are not like your father.\"\n\nNian Bing's smile vanished. Upon hearing her mention his father, his anger immediately flared. He calmly replied, \"Yes! I am not like my father. But, don't you think this is all your doing?\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess looked at Nian Bing and said, \"Although you are not like him, you are even more outstanding than he is. Combining the genes of Ice Spirit and the entire Heaven, I must admit, you are an outstanding talent. It's a pity, however, that you are their child.\"\n\nNian Bing said coldly, \"That's right, I am their child, Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess. You can do whatever you want to do, you can start now.\"\n\nA cold glint flashed in the Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess's eyes. \"Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?\"\n\nNian Bing replied, \"I am very afraid of dying. Perhaps I wasn't before. But now, I am truly afraid. Because I have confidantes, and my great revenge is yet to be avenged, how can I die? However, do you really think you can kill me?\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess looked at Nian Bing deeply. \"Do you think opening the Heavenly Eye acupoint allows you to contend with me?\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"Of course not. The Heavenly Eye acupoint can be considered a growth acupoint, or an auxiliary acupoint among the seven great acupoints. Compared to your opened Imperial Grand Acupoint, auxiliary is ultimately inferior to the strongest offense. However, I can be sure that you cannot kill me.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess said calmly, \"Your confidence must come from those swords of yours. Since you think so, we can certainly try.\" A cold aura emanated from her, and a faint mist of cold air rose around her body. The cold air was tangible. A faint blue light, though not conspicuous in the darkness of the night, was undeniably present. Golden light gradually appeared in her palm as she looked coldly at Nian Bing raising his hand.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"Your Imperial Grand Acupoint is powerful, but it's not yet fully mastered. At most, it's only a level eleven forbidden spell. However, these are useless to me.\" Although he appeared relaxed on the surface, he dared not be careless when facing the continent's number one renowned mage. Seven-colored light flashed, and seven divine swords floated out from his body, hovering around him. Each type of magic aura was clearly distinct, emanating from the swords without any confusion.\n\nA cold light flashed in the Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess's eyes, and the cold air around her body suddenly swirled. In an instant, the area within a ten-zhang radius was completely frozen, and an ice spear shot directly towards Nian Bing's chest.\n\nNian Bing looked at the Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess calmly. The Heavenly Eye acupoint between his eyebrows lit up. Instead of retreating, he advanced. The seven divine swords flashed with imperceptible speed, and the ice spear instantly turned back into its original ice elements.\n\nNian Bing did not attack; he continued to watch the Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess quietly. In fact, he felt conflicted. He desperately wanted to unleash his full power and fight the Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess to the death, but he knew he couldn't. For Lan Chen, and for his parents, it was not yet time to fight the Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess to the death.\n\nA dark shadow slowly appeared behind Nian Bing. The towering figure, three zhang tall, gradually became clear. The Heavenly Eye acupoint between Nian Bing's eyebrows turned completely black, and the seven-colored light dimmed. Seven Shadow Puppets floated out, led by the Black Martial Emperor, each holding their respective divine swords and scattering to the sides.\n\nThe colossal black figure behind Nian Bing slowly raised the five-zhang long black scythe in its hand. The aura of death surged forth, instantly engulfing everything around them. The trees, frozen by the ice, withered instantly under the shroud of death, their life force completely absorbed by the suddenly appearing grim reaper.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess's expression changed drastically. The golden light in her right hand instantly intensified, and a clear dragon's roar echoed. The icy aura instantly turned everything around them, except for Nian Bing, into fragments. The ice-element forbidden spell, Dragon of the Ice Snow Goddess, burst forth, soaring behind the Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess, confronting the Death God summoned by Nian Bing.\n\n\"Impossible, how can you also cast forbidden spells?\" The Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess's voice was no longer as cold as before.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"I just want to tell you that what you can do, I can also do. This time, we are representing the Ice Moon Empire to the Huá Róng Empire, and it is not time for conflict. Another time, I will personally visit the Ice God Tower. The battle between you and me is inevitable.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess's gaze turned cold again as she looked at the colossal shadow behind Nian Bing. \"Do you think this is enough to contend with me?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Indeed, with your Imperial Grand Acupoint, you have almost reached the strength of the thirteenth level. Even another divine descent master would find it difficult to be your opponent. However, I can tell you a secret, also for the sake of fairness in our future battle. Look closely, great Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess.\" His voice was filled with sarcasm. However, the Heavenly Eye acupoint between his eyebrows changed. The seven colors of blue, red, yellow, green, silver, white, and black instantly converged into one stream, shooting out from the Heavenly Eye acupoint. This light formed a shield around Nian Bing's body. Immediately after, the seven-colored light of his Heavenly Eye acupoint suddenly changed; this third eye had turned golden. A vast pressure erupted from Nian Bing's body, and in an instant, his body seemed to grow much taller. An unparalleled dominance emanated from him. Nian Bing glanced up at the Dragon of the Ice Snow Goddess in the air; the level eleven forbidden spell condensed into the colossal dragon's body actually trembled, and its volume shrank by a third.\n\nWithin a hundred-zhang radius, all the plants trembled under this immense pressure. The rustling of leaves created a shimmering tree shadow under the moonlight. Both the death aura of the Death God behind Nian Bing and the icy aura of the Dragon of the Ice Snow Goddess were completely suppressed at this moment. The faint golden light, though not dazzling, seemed to bring infinite power.\n\nLooking at the Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess, whose face had changed drastically in shock, Nian Bing said lightly, \"Nothing is impossible in this world. Do you think only you can have the Imperial Grand Acupoint?\" Indeed, after his mental power underwent a mutation, Nian Bing was surprised to find that he had opened another acupoint, the Imperial Grand Acupoint, known for its strongest offense. And the location of this Imperial Grand Acupoint was within the Heavenly Eye acupoint. It was precisely for this reason that he had stayed in Ka'ao's life domain for an extra half year. This was his greatest gain after his resurrection. Even Ka'ao and Tian Xiang had never seen such a situation before; they did not know what Nian Bing would develop into in the future. What would the overlap of the Imperial Grand and Heavenly Eye acupoints bring? Mutual assistance, or mutual interference? For half a year, Nian Bing could only barely use the abilities within it, but he found that he could no longer directly use mental power for physical attacks. Therefore, the opening of this Imperial Grand Acupoint had not brought him a qualitative leap in strength but had brought him considerable trouble. At this moment, the true purpose of him using the Imperial Grand Acupoint was ironically just to scare the Ice Snow Goddess's High Priestess in front of him. His strongest power was still those seven Shadow Puppets who, led by the Black Martial Emperor, possessed souls.",

    "content": "The Ice Goddess clearly felt her clothes were a little damp. This was the first time in fifty years that she had sweated, and the reason was fear. She stared blankly at Nian Bing, suddenly unsure of what to do.\n\nThe golden light retracted, and the Seven Shadow Puppets merged back into Nian Bing's body. The giant shadow behind him fused with the scythe, and Death moved.\n\nThe Dragon of the Ice Goddess let out a mournful cry. Its strength was originally slightly superior to the forbidden spell, the Scythe of Death, cast by Nian Bing. However, due to the weakened aura of the Ice Goddess Priestess and insufficient energy support, it instead weakened. With the decline of one and the rise of the other, in the collision with the Scythe of Death, it instantly turned into primal ice elements, just like the Ice Spear before.\n\nThe black shadow also disappeared at the same time as the Dragon of the Ice Goddess vanished, under the illumination of the golden light in the hands of the Ice Goddess Priestess.\n\nFeeling the air turn cold, Nian Bing turned and walked away. \"First, do what's most important. After everything is over, I will definitely come to the Ice God Tower to find you. Let us have a battle to decide the fate of my parents.\" He left with his back to the Ice Goddess Priestess, leaving his defenses completely open to her. However, the more he did this, the more hesitant the Ice Goddess Priestess became to act. Watching Nian Bing gradually recede into the distance, her gaze became somewhat distant. There was no increased hatred, but rather pure confusion. Confusion about Nian Bing's suddenly strengthened power, confusion about his Heavenly Eye that combined two acupoints, and also confusion about why he hadn't attacked her.\n\nReturning to the carriage, Feng Nu had already started a fire, but no one ate first. They were all waiting for Nian Bing's return. Seeing him safely walk back, Long Ling was the first to throw herself into his arms, patting Nian Bing all over his body, fearing he was missing anything.\n\nNian Bing grabbed Long Ling's small hand. He chuckled and said, \"Are you in such a hurry to get intimate with me? How about tonight...\"\n\nLong Ling exclaimed and escaped Nian Bing's grasp, hiding behind Feng Nu. \"You wish! Even if we are to be intimate, it should be my turn, sister. You two knew each other first.\"\n\nFeng Nu's pretty face blushed slightly, and she gave Nian Bing a questioning look. Nian Bing nodded to her and said, \"Don't worry, I'm fine. I think our journey will be much more peaceful. Alright, let's go back to the carriage.\" Lan Chen and Xi Lu, without the help of their magic swords, had already returned to the carriage when Nian Bing retracted his swords. As soon as Nian Bing entered the carriage, his body swayed slightly, and he only managed to stabilize himself with Feng Nu's support.\n\nThe concerned gazes of the three women fell on Nian Bing at the same time. Nian Bing shook his head and said, \"I'm fine, perhaps I just consumed too much magical power just now. I'll be fine after recovering.\" Although he said that, he cursed inwardly, \"This damned combination of two acupoints is detestable! It can only scare people. Not only is it useless, but it also affects my strength.\"\n\nAlthough Kao and Tian Xiang couldn't discern the true effect of his combined acupoints, Nian Bing himself felt that these two strongest acupoints merging together had only one effect: mutual interference. Not only did he lose the ability to attack with mental power as a physical entity, but when he used his mental power to simultaneously activate the two acupoints, the consumption of mental power in the seven-colored light sphere with golden light within his brow would greatly increase. It was like using mental power for physical attacks multiple times in a row. However, when used, it would produce immense pressure, and he was using this point to scare the Ice Goddess Priestess.\n\nThe night passed without incident. They continued their journey the next day. Perhaps truly intimidated by Nian Bing, the Ice Goddess Priestess did not cause trouble again, nor did she speak another word to Nian Bing. It was just like when Lan Chen, as Bing Yun, participated in the competition in the Hua Rong Empire. She never even got out of the carriage, spending every day inside, letting the coachman drive. Nian Bing often had a wicked thought: Did the Ice Goddess Priestess not need to use the restroom? When he found an opportunity to quietly ask Lan Chen, Lan Chen angrily pinched him several times before telling him that when people in the Ice God Tower cultivated magic, their bodily functions would decrease to a certain extent, making their metabolism extremely slow. This way, they could go for ten days to half a month without eating, and naturally, they wouldn't need to excrete.\n\nFourteen days later, the capital city of the Hua Rong Empire, Tian Cheng, welcomed two luxurious carriages bearing the emblem of the Ice Moon Empire. Upon arrival, they were immediately met by the reception personnel of the Hua Rong Empire. Nian Bing recognized the highest-ranking official responsible for reception, and he was very familiar with him – it was his elder brother, Rong Bing.\n\nWhen Rong Bing saw Nian Bing descend from the carriage, his gaze instantly became dazed. The next moment, the two brothers were hugging each other tightly. Nian Bing felt it most profoundly, from life to death, and from death back to life. He had once thought he would never see Rong Bing again. Finally seeing him again, how could he not be excited?\n\n\"Nian Bing, why are you with the Ice Moon Empire's envoy? Are you only these few people?\" Rong Bing asked Nian Bing with confusion.\n\nLan Chen and Long Ling were seeing Rong Bing for the first time. Seeing someone who looked exactly like their beloved man, they felt an indescribable strangeness.\n\nNian Bing gave Rong Bing a meaningful glance and said, \"Brother, let me introduce someone to you first.\" Saying this, he pulled Rong Bing to the second carriage. At this moment, the Ice Goddess Priestess had just alighted from the carriage. Upon seeing Nian Bing, she was also stunned and immediately frowned.\n\nNian Bing had already anticipated this situation and calmly said, \"This is the Ice Goddess Priestess, and this is Viscount Rong Bing, the eldest grandson of Prince Rong.\" Because Rong Bing was the eldest grandson and also the son-in-law favored by Emperor Hua Tian's most beloved granddaughter, he had already been granted a noble title.\n\nThe Ice Goddess Priestess snorted coldly and said, \"Perhaps he is also your brother.\"\n\nRong Bing looked at Nian Bing with surprise. Of course, he knew the relationship between the Ice Goddess Priestess and the Rong family. It was unexpected that the Ice Goddess Priestess was representing the Ice Moon Empire at this Four Nations Recognition Conference. However, the powerful aura emanating from the Ice Goddess Priestess made him inwardly awe-struck. As a fire mage, he had the most profound understanding of ice magic.\n\nTwo years had passed, and Rong Bing had also grown significantly. He calmly said, \"It is a great honor to have the continent's only Divine Descendant grace our country. Esteemed Ice Goddess Priestess, please.\" With that, he made an inviting gesture, leading the Ice Goddess Priestess towards the state guesthouse.\n\nFeng Nu, with a light chuckle, briefly recounted the misunderstanding when she first met Rong Bing to Lan Chen and Long Ling, which immediately drew peals of laughter from the two girls. Fortunately, Lan Chen's appearance and temperament had already been altered under the influence of the Ice Sighing Morning Dew Blade, so she did not arouse the suspicion of the Ice Goddess Priestess.\n\nAfter Rong Bing settled everyone, he immediately went to Nian Bing's room. The rooms in the state guesthouse were standard, with two people per room. The three girls were shy and did not feel comfortable sharing a room with Nian Bing. Nian Bing also took care not to neglect Xi Lu, so he shared a room with Xi Lu. The three girls, on the other hand, added an extra bed in another room and stayed together.\n\n\"Brother, what exactly is going on with you?\" Rong Bing asked impatiently as soon as he entered the room. While speaking, he glanced at Xi Lu beside him. Under the effect of the Longevity Blade, Xi Lu was extremely tall. Xi Lu had spoken very little along the way. At this moment, he was leaning against the window, looking at the prosperous scene of Tian Cheng.\n\nNian Bing pulled Rong Bing to sit down. \"Brother, it's alright. Big Brother Xi Lu is one of us. Don't worry. I know you must be wondering why I became an envoy for the Ice Moon Empire. Actually, wasn't I representing the Ice Moon Empire when I returned for the competition before?\"\n\nRong Bing frowned. \"But this time is different. The person presiding over the conference is our grandfather. The situation at the Four Nations Recognition Conference is delicate. Do you want to go against grandfather? And what about that Ice Goddess Priestess? She's also here. Is she trying to intimidate our Hua Rong Empire?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, and a faint seven-colored light floated out, enveloping both their bodies. The pure mental energy barrier cut off all sound from leaking out. He then said, \"You don't need to worry about the Ice Goddess Priestess. Although she is a powerful mage, she is not a good politician. The real envoy this time is actually me. As for your doubts, brother, I cannot answer them for you right now. However, since grandfather took me back into the Rong family, everything I do will naturally not harm the interests of the Rong family. I will talk to grandfather, but not now.\"\n\nNian Bing's mental power couldn't help but startle Rong Bing. \"Brother, what kind of magic is this?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Brother, this is a special magic that I cultivated myself, based on mental power and the seven elements of magic. Let's not talk about this for now. Oh, right, have you gotten married yet?\"\n\nRong Bing's face turned slightly red and said, \"Not yet, it will be a few more years. I won't ask too many questions about your affairs. Anyway, since you are an envoy for the Ice Moon Empire, grandfather will handle it. You've been gone for nearly two years, and you haven't come back to see me. Have you forgotten about your brother?\"\n\nNian Bing recalled the struggles between life and death over the past two years, his heart rippling. He said with a wry smile, \"I wanted to come back and see you, but circumstances didn't allow it! Brother, I have many things to handle this time. First, tell me what has happened in the Hua Rong Empire in the past two years. Grandfather's actions are really fast! In just two years, he weakened Lang Mu, destroyed Qilu, his actions were like lightning, and he has already laid the foundation in the south.\"\n\nRong Bing smiled and said, \"Yes! Grandfather has been preparing for this day for a long time. Do you know that when we destroyed Qilu, I also participated in the battle, and under grandfather's deliberate command, I made some contributions.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Grandfather is laying the foundation for his successor of the next generation! Brother, you must work hard. In our generation, no one in the Rong family can compete with you.\"\n\nRong Bing suddenly said seriously, \"Nian Bing, if you came back, I would rather give this position to you. Not only is your magic stronger than mine, but your other abilities are also much better. From you representing the Ice Moon Empire as an envoy, I already understand your strength. Nian Bing, are you really going to be used by the Ice Moon Empire?\"\n\nNian Bing raised his hand and grabbed Rong Bing's shoulder. \"No, brother, the position of Rong family head will definitely be yours in the future. Don't worry, I don't belong to any country, but my surname is always Rong. As long as you need help, I will always be your shadow in the dark. We are brothers, and I am used to freedom, I can't stand the atmosphere of the family. Contributing to the Rong family doesn't necessarily mean being within the family. Do your job as heir well. Alright, quickly tell me about the situation here. You shouldn't stay here with me for too long.\"\n\nRong Bing gave Nian Bing a deep look and said, \"After you left, we began our attack on the Lang Mu Empire. Because of years of peace, the defenses of the Lang Mu Empire were more lax than before. Furthermore, we opened up a special passage and forcibly entered the Lang Mu plains. Relying on our two main cavalry regiments and a large number of elite cavalry, we used speed to defeat their many main forces. Father was in charge of logistics and led the army to carry out a cleansing operation.\" Speaking of this, he couldn't help but smile. \"Father is truly ruthless! Everywhere he went, he left almost not a single grain of food for the Lang Mu Empire, yet he didn't kill anyone. This way, he wouldn't provoke public outrage and be counterattacked by the common people of the Lang Mu Empire, and it would cause great burden to the Lang Mu Empire. Just dealing with these starving people kept the Lang Mu Empire very busy for a long time. Even if they had sufficient food reserves, they were busy for half a year to gradually calm down after such a sudden change. It was precisely because of the losses from this battle and the large consumption of food reserves that they missed the best opportunity to attack us at a critical moment. Grandfather once said that among the other four countries, Hua Rong feared only the combined forces of the Ice Moon Empire and the Lang Mu Empire. As for the others, they could be easily dealt with. You probably know what happened next. We suddenly launched an attack, and it was like splitting bamboo as we entered the interior of the Qilu Empire, directly attacking its capital, forcing the Qilu Empire to surrender and annexing the entire empire into our territory. Although we paid a considerable price, compared to the final result, these costs were worth it. This Four Nations Recognition Conference was proposed by Prime Minister Su, and its purpose was to ease the contradictions between us and the other three countries. After two consecutive major battles, it is time for the soldiers to recuperate. However, we are not afraid now. Even if Olan, Lang Mu, and Ice Moon join forces, it is not easy to deal with my Hua Rong Empire. After all, our country's soldiers are elite troops with extensive combat experience. Because of the delaying tactics adopted by Su Di Di after our grandfather attacked the Qilu Empire, they have already adjusted to a certain extent. Even if they have to respond suddenly, they can hold on for some time.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing smiled and shook his head. \"Big brother, what you see is likely just the surface. In reality, the Hua Rong Empire's biggest crisis right now isn't the upcoming Four Nations Public Opinion Conference, but rather the Qi Lu Empire. That's why this conference is being convened, right?\" Along the way, Nian Bing had gradually sorted out his thoughts and was beginning to understand the significance of this Four Nations Public Opinion Conference.\n\nRong Bing exclaimed in surprise, \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\nNian Bing calmly stated, \"Although the Qi Lu Empire was annexed, and the Hua Rong Empire paid a very small price, don't forget that because of their past alliance with the Hua Rong Empire, the Qi Lu Empire's influence was not insignificant. Moreover, the Qi Lu Empire's territory is the third largest, surpassed only by Hua Rong and Lang Mu. Your attack, while effective, may not have annihilated Qi Lu's main forces. The most crucial task for the Hua Rong Empire now is to completely pacify Qi Lu. Completely annexing a country isn't something that can be achieved in a year or two. While there may seem to be no immediate crisis, there will undoubtedly be individuals in the Qi Lu Empire who are unwilling to submit. While large-scale rebellions might not occur, smaller conflicts will persist for a considerable time. The potential for guerrilla warfare alone will trouble the Hua Rong Empire for a long time. To stabilize the situation in the Qi Lu Empire, at least an army group would need to be stationed in various parts of the Qi Lu Empire, and they must be elite troops. Am I correct?\"\n\nRong Bing looked at Nian Bing and suddenly laughed, \"Good kid, you're really smart! Are you blaming me for not telling you the truth?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head, \"No, of course not. We are brothers; how could I blame you? After all, I am representing the Bing Yue Empire here. We are on different sides, so it's understandable for you to hold back.\"\n\nRong Bing sighed softly, \"I'm glad you understand my difficulties. Yes, your guess is very accurate. My father is currently stationed in the Qi Lu Empire, leading the entire elite of the Eastern Army Group. They are gradually integrating the Qi Lu Empire's local forces, breaking up their order and assigning them to our troops, expanding the Eastern Army Group from one to three army groups in scale. However, making Qi Lu soldiers fully loyal to us is not easy. Now, we are waiting for these troops to complete their reorganization and return to the mainland, where they will be gradually assimilated within our interior. This process will likely take some time!\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"If that's the case, then it's very clear. Currently, only two army groups are responsible for defense. Although the Hua Rong Empire is no longer facing enemies on three sides, the southern front spans the borders of two empires. How can just two army groups defend it? If the other three empires were to launch a joint attack now, the situation would likely not be optimistic. Even if grandfather's prestige can withstand it, the losses would be immense. The Lang Mu Empire is precisely targeting this point, which is why they are desperately trying to win over the Ao Lan Empire and the Bing Yue Empire. Prime Minister Grandpa Su is also targeting this point, which is why he is using various situations to continuously delay time. Every day that passes, the Hua Rong Empire becomes stronger. Right now, both sides are only fighting for time.\"\n\nRong Bing said, \"I'm not very clear about the specifics. I'm a soldier now, only responsible for fighting. I'm not good at these political schemes. However, if grandfather hears such precise analysis, he will surely be very happy to have such a good grandson.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and shook his head, \"Actually, what I see is just the surface. Compared to those politicians, I'm still too naive. After all, I've only been exposed to these things for a very short time. Brother, you're right, you're a soldier. It's enough to understand these matters; don't get involved. Otherwise, it will disrupt your life and make it difficult for you to have happy times.\"\n\nRong Bing said with a wry smile, \"As the successor, even if I don't want to participate, I probably won't have a choice in the future. You are the last to arrive. The envoys from the Ao Lan Empire and the Lang Mu Empire have already arrived. Compared to them, your arrival is quite meager. The Ao Lan Empire is doing better, with only a few dozen people, but the Lang Mu Empire has a grand procession of hundreds. Only the Bing Yue Empire has come with a mere eight people. Does the Seventh Prince of the Bing Yue Empire, who is set to inherit the throne, not attach importance to this conference? I really didn't expect it! I saw him before; how could such a lazy person like him ascend to the throne?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Although we have fewer people, we are refined! Isn't the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess alone something that other countries cannot compare to? Brother, don't underestimate anyone. The Northeast Wind is not what you see; he is very capable, but he has been hiding himself because he never had the opportunity. Now that he has ascended to the throne, the Bing Yue Empire will surely develop rapidly. Oh, right, who are the people representing each country in negotiations this time?\" He thought to himself, if he told his brother that the people he brought this time were at least strong individuals with the power of a Magus or above, he wondered what his brother would think. There was even a martial artist in the room whose strength was not inferior to the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess.\n\nRong Bing said, \"Our country's representative to the Great Emperor will naturally be Grandpa Su and our grandfather.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"I guessed it would be them. Grandpa Su's wisdom combined with our grandfather's deterrence is indeed the best combination. What about the other two countries?\"\n\nRong Bing said, \"You've also met the Lang Mu Empire's representative; it's Miss Mu Jing, who participated in the competition last time. Her brother did not come this time. Considering her age and that she can represent the Lang Mu Empire, it shows her status within the Lang Mu Empire. Oh, right, after you left last time, we discovered a large number of Lang Mu Empire spies. That time, the Lang Mu Empire suffered considerable losses! Only the siblings Mu Rong and Mu Jing managed to escape. However, they don't seem to have learned from their previous lesson; there are more people coming this time than last time. I really don't know what they are thinking. Do they think these few hundred people can achieve anything?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Each side has its own different ideas. That Mu Jing is not easy to deal with. Last time, it was only because Du Tian City was Hua Rong Empire territory and with grandfather present that we could easily resolve the threats they brought. This woman cannot be underestimated.\" He knew clearly in his heart that the reason the people Mu Jing brought last time were wiped out was likely not unrelated to the Blood Lion Sect, which he managed. Otherwise, with only the people visible on the surface, it would not have been easy to find so many infiltrated enemies.\n\nRong Bing said, \"The strangest among the unfortunate ones is the Ao Lan Empire. This time, they sent a young woman as their envoy, not Duke Lan Yu, who has always been responsible for handling major affairs. Accompanying her is a middle-aged woman, serving as her deputy. Their subordinates are not unusual; they are elites from the Silver Feather Knights. However, Grandpa Su seems to attach great importance to this Ao Lan Empire envoy. I'm just not sure what happened during the negotiations with the Ao Lan Empire, otherwise, I could make some judgments.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"I know who the Ao Lan Empire sent. Brother, just you wait and see. This girl is truly formidable! Speaking of which, it was the Bing Yue Empire that pushed her towards the Ao Lan Empire back then. After a few years without seeing her, I wonder what she has become.\"\n\nRong Bing exclaimed in surprise, \"Nian Bing, why do you perk up whenever you mention women? Quickly, confess! Why are there three women accompanying you? You wouldn't...\"\n\nXi Lu, who had been watching from the side, suddenly turned around and chuckled, \"Nian Bing is very capable in this regard! Those three are all his wives. Your brotherly ability probably can't match his.\"\n\nNian Bing blushed and said with a wry smile, \"Brother Xi Lu, please stop teasing me. But, brother, they are indeed all your sisters-in-law. You've met Feng Nu. As for the other two...\"\n\nRong Bing was stunned for a moment. He had only guessed, but he didn't expect that the three uniquely charming beauties were actually Nian Bing's women. He looked at him with a somewhat strange expression and said, \"Alright, you're truly capable. But you won't tell me that the other two are as strong as Feng Nu, will you? The situation in Du Tian City is a bit chaotic right now. Aren't you afraid they might get into trouble?\"\n\nNian Bing said confidently, \"I'm not worried about that. It's good enough if they don't provoke others. Why would they be afraid of others provoking them? Alright, brother, you should go back now. I've understood the situation here. To avoid suspicion, it's best for you to see me less, lest it arouse suspicion from others.\"\n\nRong Bing laughed, \"Suspicion? What suspicion? With our similar appearance, it's already a huge suspicion. Let them suspect if they want. Given the Rong family's status in the Hua Rong Empire, who would dare to gossip now?\"\n\nNian Bing sighed, \"Brother, that's precisely what worries me. The Rong family is too much in the spotlight. If there's a chance, I really need to have a good talk with grandfather. Go back and tell grandfather that I'm here. If he's willing to see me, send someone to deliver a message, and I'll find a way to get there.\"\n\nRong Bing also knew that he shouldn't linger for too long. He nodded at Nian Bing, bid farewell to Xi Lu, and turned to leave.\n\nLying on the bed, Nian Bing's mind raced. According to Rong Bing, the main envoy from Ao Lan should be the wise woman Luo Rou, and the main envoy from the Lang Mu Empire is Mu Jing. This is going to be interesting. He hoped that the person accompanying Luo Rou would be Yu Ruyan. If that were the case, some matters would be much easier to handle.\n\n\"Nian Bing, I'm hungry. Aren't you an envoy from that country? Surely they provide food here, right?\" Xi Lu closed the window and rubbed his protesting stomach.\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Brother Xi Lu, your appetite is growing more and more. Back on the Divine Continent, I didn't see you eat so much!\"\n\nXi Lu smiled sheepishly and said, \"Food was scarce there, so naturally, we had to eat sparingly. But it's different here. Finally, we've arrived on this continent where we can eat our fill, so why should I deprive my stomach?\"\n\nA flash of inspiration struck Nian Bing's mind, and he immediately recalled the stew pot that Rong Bing had taken him to eat. He quickly said, \"Alright, then let's go out and have a good feast. I'll let you try some new things today. Let's go.\"\n\nNian Bing changed into civilian clothes, put on the straw hat he had prepared earlier, and went out with Xi Lu. He called the three women next door, and they left the state guesthouse.\n\nIn the room on the other side, a Magus under the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess saw the five of them leave from the window and quickly said to the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, \"Priestess, they've gone out. Should I follow them?\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess shook her head and said, \"No need. It's useless for you to follow this person.\" Since their brief encounter that day, she had been pondering Nian Bing's dual cultivation of the Heavenly Eye and Emperor's Pole. She simply couldn't believe that such a thing could happen, but the facts were laid out before her. The oppressive aura Nian Bing exuded at that time had left a deep impression on her. In her heart, it was the first time she doubted her status as the continent's foremost divine spellcaster. Similarly, with instantaneous forbidden spells and the aid of seven divine artifacts, such strength was indeed not something she could easily defeat. What a young man! How old was he to have reached this level?\n\nClosing her eyes, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess continued her meditation, but several figures appeared in her mind.\n\nNian Bing, along with Xi Lu and the three women, walked on the wide streets. Although he had experienced many hardships in his childhood, every time he returned here, he felt like he was home. After all, this was his birthplace, and his parents had also spent their most beautiful time here.\n\nLong Ling was visiting Du Tian City for the first time. Like Xi Lu, she looked around with excitement. She never thought too much about things. After following Nian Bing to Bing Yue City, she hadn't even seen her father. It wasn't that she didn't want to, but she dared not. She feared her father wouldn't allow her to stay by Nian Bing's side. Nian Bing had finally returned alive, and she just wanted to accompany him for a while longer. Once Nian Bing's affairs were settled and things calmed down, she would find an opportunity to return to her father and fulfill her filial duties. Because Long Zhi had made things difficult for Nian Bing last time and betrothed her to the Fifth Prince, Long Ling still harbored some resentment. Although she didn't say it out loud, she now considered Nian Bing as the person closest to her. This time, accompanying Nian Bing all the way to Du Tian City, she regarded it as a trip. Looking at the completely different scenery of the Hua Rong Empire's capital compared to the Bing Yue Empire, she was incredibly happy.\n\n\"Nian Bing, it's much warmer here than in the Bing Yue Empire! The temperature difference is at least double!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Of course. This is the southernmost part of the continent, so the temperature has always been high. Even in winter, the plants are evergreen. Du Tian City is one of the most livable cities on the continent. Here, as long as you have money, you can find almost anything you want. Three beautiful ladies, don't be polite with me. Yan Feng gave me a lot of money this time. Buy whatever you like.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing had never been good with money. Although he was here on business, the conference hadn't started yet. It was a rare chance to bring his beloved three women out for some fun, and he naturally wanted them to be happy.\n\nLan Chen smiled and walked beside Nian Bing. Having followed the Ice Snow Goddess's priestesses in secluded cultivation since she was young, she was pure and detached, not very interested in the outside world. It was Feng Nu and Long Ling who browsed the surrounding shops, enjoying themselves immensely. They didn't buy anything, as few things truly caught their eye.\n\nAfter walking for half the day and crossing only one street, Xi Lu couldn't help but complain in a low voice, \"Nian Bing, at this rate your two wives are walking, I'll probably starve to death before we reach a place to eat. Can we grab something to eat first?\" For him, the greatest attraction of the Yangguang Continent had always been its cuisine.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"Alright, let's eat first. Feng Nu, I'll take Chen Chen and Brother Xi Lu to the congee shop we met at last time. You and Ling Er can browse a bit longer and then join us.\"\n\nFeng Nu and Long Ling were picking out clothes in a clothing store. Although they wore straw hats, the noble aura they exuded inadvertently made the female shop owner constantly fawn over them, presenting them with the best items. When Feng Nu heard Nian Bing mention the congee shop, her pretty face flushed. Fortunately, the white veil on her straw hat covered it, making it impossible to see from the outside. \"Okay, you guys go ahead. We'll play for a bit longer and then come find you. If anything happens, just play your wind flute to call me.\"\n\nNian Bing cautioned, \"This is Ling Er's first time in Du Tian City. You have to keep a close eye on her and don't let her get lost.\"\n\nFeng Nu let out a chuckle. \"Do you think we're still children? How could we get lost? Hurry along.\"\n\nNian Bing then quickened his pace with Xi Lu and Lan Chen towards the congee shop they had visited before. Since the guesthouse wasn't far from the congee shop, they arrived in front of it in no time. Just like last time, there was already a queue. Even though it wasn't mealtime, Nian Bing and the others were still about ten people back.\n\nXi Lu sniffed the air, inhaling the aroma wafting from the shop, and quietly asked Nian Bing, \"Brother, how long will we have to wait to eat!\"\n\nNian Bing shrugged his shoulders. \"I didn't expect it to be this popular. So many people are here even when it's not a restaurant.\"\n\nLan Chen smiled. \"Is the food here really that delicious? Perhaps we should go somewhere else. Nearby would be fine, so Sister and the others can find us.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"No, let's eat here. You don't know, the congee here is very special. Think about what your husband does. Even I find it extremely delicious, so it can't be bad. Feng Nu and Ling Er truly have foresight! Chen Chen, why don't you go join them for a while? Brother Xi Lu and I can wait in line here.\"\n\nShaking her head, Lan Chen smiled slightly and didn't insist. She held Nian Bing's large hand tightly with her slightly cool small hand, her shoulder resting against his arm. She had always preferred quiet. It was a rare opportunity for her to be alone with Nian Bing. Even though they were standing and waiting, she felt very comfortable, thinking to herself, \"If only it could be like this forever!\"\n\nNian Bing, naturally unaware of Lan Chen's thoughts, looked into the congee shop. Like Xi Lu, he eagerly hoped to get inside soon. Suddenly, as he casually looked up, he saw a graceful figure flash past the shop window. His heart stirred, and a faint smile appeared on his face. \"It seems we can eat this congee earlier than expected.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Nian Bing led Lan Chen out of the queue. Bing Yun looked surprised. \"Why aren't we queuing anymore?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled mysteriously. \"When you meet someone you know, you don't need to queue. You know this person too, Chen Chen, restore your original appearance. Hehehe.\"\n\nSeeing the mischievous smile on Nian Bing's face, Lan Chen felt a warmth in her heart. The Morning Dew Blade remained within her body, and under Nian Bing's mental control, her original appearance was restored. The three of them walked directly to the front of the congee shop. Just as they were about to enter, they were stopped by a waiter. \"Sorry, the three of you, our shop is already full. Please queue at the back. Thank you.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"No need to queue. My friend is already dining on the second floor. Please take us upstairs.\"\n\nThe waiter was stunned. \"Oh, so that's how it is. Then, please follow me, the three of you.\" Led by him, Nian Bing and the other two ascended to the second floor. The second floor was entirely made up of private rooms. When the waiter asked Nian Bing for the room number, Nian Bing found himself in a bit of a predicament. He only knew the general direction, but how could he know the room number? However, this didn't stump him. His mental energy spread out instantly, and in the blink of an eye, he found the exact location and pointed to a room. The waiter quickly led them over.\n\nThe waiter gestured for Nian Bing and the other two to wait, then knocked lightly on the private room door. A calm voice came from inside, \"Didn't I tell you not to disturb me?\"\n\nThe waiter respectfully replied, \"I'm sorry, your guests have arrived.\"\n\n\"Our guests?\" The voice from the room gained a touch of surprise.\n\nBing Yun glanced at Nian Bing, who seemed confident, and couldn't help but pinch his hand. She whispered, \"Annoying, you're always so mysterious. Who is in this room!\"\n\nBefore Nian Bing could answer, the door opened, and a graceful figure walked out. Bing Yun's eyes flashed, and she immediately recognized the person: it was Mu Jing, the representative from the Hu Mu Empire who had participated in the Five Nations Newcomer Mage Competition. As Mu Jing opened the door, she saw the tall Nian Bing at first glance and was stunned. \"How is it you?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"It's better to meet by chance than to seek each other out. We were queuing downstairs and suddenly saw Miss's figure through the window, so we came up to disturb you. Would it be convenient to dine together?\"\n\nMu Jing's eyes flickered, but her face revealed a hint of hesitation. \"Brother Nian Bing, I'm really sorry. I'm entertaining a friend right now, so it's not very convenient. Perhaps you could tell me where you're staying? Once I'm done here, Mu Jing will visit immediately.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Is that so? It's been many days, and Miss Mu Jing has become even more beautiful. I've just arrived from the Bingyue Empire and am staying at the State Guesthouse. If Miss has time, you can come over to our place.\" After speaking, he took Bing Yun's hand and turned to leave.\n\nUpon hearing Nian Bing's words, Mu Jing's expression changed drastically, and she quickly said, \"Brother Nian Bing, please wait a moment.\"\n\nNian Bing turned back and smiled. \"What, is there anything else?\"\n\nMu Jing asked, \"You said you're staying at the State Guesthouse. Are you perhaps the envoys from the Bingyue Empire this time?\"\n\nNian Bing had already guessed she would react this way. He nodded. \"I am honored that His Majesty does not deem me unworthy. I have come this time as a High Mage representing the Bingyue Empire.\"\n\nMu Jing looked at Nian Bing's meaningful gaze and felt a chill in her heart. \"If that's the case, then we are not outsiders. The friend I am entertaining is from the Olan Empire. Brother Nian, please come in. We can talk then.\" As she spoke, she quickly moved aside to open the doorway.\n\nNian Bing tightened his grip on Bing Yun's hand. \"Brother Xi Lu, didn't I say we wouldn't have to queue? Miss Mu Jing has always been hospitable.\" As he spoke, they entered the room.\n\nThis private room was very spacious, with a large dining table in the center capable of seating twenty people. Besides Mu Jing, there were three other people in the room, each with a smaller congee pot in front of them.\n\n\"Nian Bing?\" Exclamations arose. Two of the three people in the room stood up – Yu Ru Yan and Zhi Nu Luo Rou, whom Nian Bing hadn't seen in a long time. Yu Ru Yan appeared a bit thinner, but her gaze was even sharper. Luo Rou had changed significantly since Nian Bing last saw her. She wore a long black dress, looking very plain and elegant. Although the style of the dress was simple, there was a deep blue gemstone about three inches in diameter on the chest, which complemented her deep blue eyes. Her wavy long hair had grown by at least a foot. To prevent her hair from becoming loose, it had previously hung down to her thighs. Now, as she stood up, it was clear her hair had grown past her knees. The biggest change was her temperament. In Nian Bing's memory, although Luo Rou was full of wisdom, she also appeared somewhat proud. But now, her profound gaze held a certain tranquility, and her aura was much more mature than before.\n\n\"Mom, Miss Luo Rou.\" Yu Ru Yan seemed to have forgotten that Mu Jing was present. With a flash, she came before Nian Bing, grabbed his shoulders with both hands, and her gaze continuously scanned him. Feeling the vigorous life force emanating from Nian Bing, Yu Ru Yan's eyes couldn't help but moisten. \"Good, good, child, it's great that you're alright.\"\n\nMu Jing stood aside, somewhat dazed. She never expected Nian Bing and Yu Ru Yan to have such a relationship. When Nian Bing called out \"Mom,\" her heart was thrown into disarray.\n\n\"Mom.\" Bing Yun suddenly lifted her straw hat and threw herself into her mother's arms, tears flowing uncontrollably. After a year and a half, she was finally seeing her mother again. How could she not be excited? Yu Ru Yan's heart was filled with joy at this moment. With one arm around her daughter and the other holding Nian Bing's hand, she was too emotional to speak.\n\nLuo Rou looked at Nian Bing with a deep gaze, then at Lan Chen. Her initial excitement quickly subsided. She walked up to Nian Bing and smiled. \"Nian Bing, it's been a long time.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"It really has been a long time. I heard about Miss's reputation when I was in the Bingyue Empire.\"\n\nLuo Rou looked deeply at Nian Bing. \"Isn't that thanks to you? Luo Rou has never had a chance to thank you.\"\n\nA hint of surprise appeared in Nian Bing's eyes because he didn't understand why Luo Rou was using her real name instead of her alias. \"Alright, let's sit down first. Don't let Miss Mu Jing laugh at us.\" As he spoke, he gently squeezed Yu Ru Yan's hand.\n\nYu Ru Yan then reacted and pulled Lan Chen to sit beside her, using her Dou Qi to condense her voice and say something to her.\n\nAt this moment, Mu Jing's heart was even more chaotic. Lan Chen, no, in her mind, Bing Yun, this powerful mage of the Ice God Tower, could she also be Yu Ru Yan's daughter? What was Nian Bing's true identity? Since he was representing the Bingyue Empire, yet his relationship with Yu Ru Yan was so close, and he was familiar with Luo Rou, whom she considered a rival. Looking at how he entered with Bing Yun, it was clear they were very intimate. A year and a half ago, they were still adversaries. Chaos, everything was in chaos.\n\nA layer of blue light rose around Bing Yun's body. Her voice, under the influence of the ice element, was contained. She was conversing with Yu Ru Yan as if she had forgotten that others were present. Nian Bing's gaze shifted and fell upon the only stranger in the room. Seeing this person, his heart couldn't help but tremble slightly. He was a handsome man, appearing to be around thirty years old, dressed in exquisite green warrior attire. His aura was completely contained, making him seem like an ordinary person on the surface. If not for Nian Bing's strong mental power, he wouldn't have been able to perceive his true aura. This person hid his strength very well, with his Dou Qi completely condensed within his body. However, through his observation using the Tianyan acupoint, Nian Bing discovered that this person was by no means simple. His energy intensity was no less than Xi Lu's. This discovery made him somewhat bewildered. When did such a martial arts master who surpassed the twelfth level appear on the Yangguang Continent? No wonder Mu Jing only brought him when inviting Luo Rou and Yu Ru Yan for dinner.\n\nLuo Rou asked Nian Bing to sit beside her, while Xi Lu sat on Nian Bing's other side. Luo Rou didn't look at Yu Ru Yan and her daughter. She smiled. \"Nian Bing, it turns out you know Miss Mu Jing too. Jingjing and I have been good friends since childhood. She even lived at our house for a long time.\" It was precisely because she saw Nian Bing's confusion that she introduced them this way.\n\nNian Bing found it a bit strange. Since Mu Jing was a princess of the Lang Mu Empire, why would she live in Bing Xue City? However, he didn't ask and smiled. \"What a coincidence! We are respectively representing the three major empires to participate in the Four Nations Public Opinion Conference, and we met at this congee shop. Oh, Miss Mu Jing, should we ask the waiter to serve more food? We haven't eaten yet.\"\n\nMu Jing then came back to her senses. She indeed possessed extraordinary composure, and her expression immediately returned to normal. She smiled and nodded, called for a waiter, and ordered more food. From the moment Xi Lu entered, his gaze had been fixed on the handsome man, and the man had also been looking at him. Their gazes met and clashed in the air, neither yielding.\n\nNian Bing asked, \"I don't know what the two ladies are discussing. May I participate as well?\"\n\nMu Jing smiled charmingly. \"Of course. Actually, we were guessing who the Bingyue Empire would send to participate in this Four Nations Public Opinion Conference, and we didn't expect you to find your way here yourself.\"\n\nAs if not hearing the hint of sarcasm in her words, Nian Bing smiled slightly. \"That's why I said it was a coincidence. In fact, I am merely an envoy. The highest-ranking official sent by our country this time is not me. I am only responsible for negotiations, but the delegation is led by her.\"",

    "content": "Mu Jing pretended to be surprised and said, \"Oh? I just heard Brother Nian say that you've already become a Royal Court Mage. Why aren't you leading the team?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"It's Bingyun's master. You all must know her, she's the guardian deity of our Ice Moon Empire, the High Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess.\" As he said this, his gaze never left Mu Jing's body. He clearly felt her body tremble slightly, and her expression changed instantly. Although this process was very short, Nian Bing caught it precisely.\n\nLuo Rou, who was beside them, spoke up, \"Oh, so it's the High Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess. I'd like to meet this Divine Descendant, the only one on the continent, if I have the chance.\"\n\nThe man who had been staring at Xi Lu with his eyes let out a cold snort, and said with a hint of disdain, \"Is being a Divine Descendant so great? I'd like to see it if I get the chance.\"\n\nTaking advantage of his pause, Nian Bing quickly asked Mu Jing, \"May I ask who this is?\"\n\nMu Jing smiled and said, \"This is my newly accepted master, Teacher Zhamulun. He is a Battle Mage, deeply respected by our royal family.\"\n\nZhamushi? The name sounded a little strange. At this moment, the waiter brought over three more pots, placing them in front of Nian Bing and the other three who had just arrived. Various dishes were served. Nian Bing quietly explained a few things about magic preparation to Xi Lu. Xi Lu did not stand on ceremony and immediately got to work, no longer looking at Zhamulun.\n\nMu Jing smiled and said, \"Brother Nian, since you represent the Ice Moon Empire, have you met our envoy sent to your country? How are the negotiations going?\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"I am aware of the alliance, but regarding the specific outcome, my king has not explicitly stated it. We will discuss it after the Four Nations Public Forum concludes.\"\n\nMu Jing frowned slightly and said, \"Brother Nian is a wise person. I believe you understand the current situation. Don't tell me that Brother Nian is ignoring the survival of his own country because of his past ties with the Hua Rong Empire?\"\n\nNian Bing took a sip of the porridge that had just been served, saying, \"Miss Mu Jing's words are a bit harsh. It's true that I was once from the Hua Rong Empire, but ever since I arrived in the Ice Moon Empire, I have had no further ties with the Hua Rong Empire. His Majesty sent me to attend this conference, naturally trusting me. As for how our Ice Moon Empire will act, I'm afraid it's not something your country can control.\"\n\nA cold glint flashed in Mu Jing's eyes, but she immediately calmed down and nodded, \"It was Mu Jing's slip of the tongue. Please forgive me, Brother Nian. However, the situation is critical now, and opportunity waits for no one!\"\n\nNian Bing did not answer directly and turned to look at Luo Rou beside him, smiling, \"What are Miss Luo Rou's thoughts?\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled slightly and said, \"The Lang Mu Empire has given us great support, allowing many of our poor people to have enough to eat ahead of time. The Ao Lan Empire is deeply grateful and has decided to form an alliance with the Lang Mu Empire. However, our country has been very poor for many years, and mobilizing troops is beyond our capacity. Barely holding our defensive line is already our maximum effort.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled inwardly. What a cunning and intelligent Luo Rou! Her meaning was very clear: an alliance was possible, but the Ao Lan Empire would not send troops. This was in line with his own thinking. Judging by her words, it seemed possible to let the Lang Mu Empire pass through their territory and attack the Hua Rong Empire from another direction. He nodded, \"I see. Indeed, the Ao Lan Empire is not suitable for sending troops. Your country has experienced too much hardship and needs time to recover.\"\n\nMu Jing sighed. \"Little sister Luo Rou, you are still too conservative. If you don't seize such a great opportunity, perhaps in the future...\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"On the contrary, I quite agree with Miss Luo Rou's opinion. The alliance of our three countries would be beneficial for the development of all nations. However, the Ao Lan Empire has experienced many years of war and it's not appropriate to wage war again. As for our Ice Moon Empire, a long expedition is not a good strategy, so we still need to consider. Come, let's all have some porridge, it's really delicious.\"\n\nMu Jing gave Nian Bing a deep look and said, \"Brother Nian, since your country is willing to form an alliance, we should all show some sincerity, don't you think?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Even the High Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess has been invited. Doesn't that represent our country's sincerity? Miss Mu Jing, for today, let's just talk about friendship and not about state affairs. After all, the Four Nations Public Forum will begin the day after tomorrow, so there's no need to rush. Miss, you need to think more, and we also need to consider our future development. Miss Luo Rou, what do you say?\"\n\nLuo Rou met Nian Bing's gaze. Nian Bing was also looking at her, and both of them revealed a knowing smile. Luo Rou nodded, \"Yes, it's rare that we can get out together. Today, let's relax and not talk about state affairs anymore. Luo Rou is really a bit tired!\"\n\nFrom the moment they met, Nian Bing noticed that Luo Rou's physical condition was very poor. Although she had practiced some battle aura, her body was clearly overstrained, leading to a decline in her physical functions and the loss of her life force. It was obvious that Luo Rou had poured a lot of effort into the Ao Lan Empire over the past few years, allowing a dilapidated empire to gradually move towards prosperity.\n\nMu Jing looked at the two who were in tacit understanding and suppressed her anger, smiling, \"Alright then, we won't talk about business today. The porridge here tastes really good. Ask for whatever else you need, it's my treat today.\" She was also calculating her own plan. Under the current circumstances, it seemed impossible to get Nian Bing and Luo Rou to make any promises. What was the use of just an alliance? What was needed now was to buy time and launch an attack before the Hua Rong Empire could establish a foothold. However, the strength of the Lang Mu Empire alone was clearly insufficient. Only by joining forces with the three countries could there be hope for success.\n\nAs they were eating, there was a knock on the door. The waiter said from outside, \"Everyone, you have more guests.\"\n\nAs Mu Jing was startled, Nian Bing had already stood up, smiling and saying, \"They are with me.\"\n\nAfter saying that, he stepped forward and opened the door. Feng Nu and Long Ling had arrived. The two women were dressed exactly like Lan Chen. As soon as they entered the room, they simultaneously heard Nian Bing's voice, \"Don't be agitated, Mom and Luo Rou are here.\"\n\nFeng Nu trembled all over and immediately saw Yu Ruyan. Long Ling also saw Luo Rou. Although the two women had received Nian Bing's instructions, they still involuntarily quickened their pace to the table. When they took off their veiled hats, just like Lan Chen before them, the entire room seemed to brighten. Their peerless beauty immediately made Mu Jing appear dim. Even Luo Rou couldn't help but show a look of surprise. The exquisite beauty of Feng Nu and Lan Chen was something she and Mu Jing could not compare to. Even Long Ling was half a step ahead of them.\n\nLong Ling also saw Mu Jing and said in surprise, \"Rou'er, Jingjing, so you are both here!\"\n\nMu Jing stood up and happily went to greet her, \"Ling'er, why are you here too? You...\" Speaking of this, she couldn't help but look at Nian Bing again. Long Ling's face turned slightly red and she whispered, \"I'll explain when I have the chance.\" Her expression had already told Mu Jing a lot, and she understood many things without needing an explanation.\n\nNian Bing pulled Feng Nu and Long Ling to sit down and instructed the waiter to add three more pots of porridge, one of which was for Xi Lu, who had already finished his food.\n\nLuo Rou affectionately let Long Ling sit on her other side. Two of the three beauties of Ice Snow City finally met again. Feng Nu sat next to Yu Ruyan. Yu Ruyan held her hand, her eyes glistening with tears. Her daughters had finally returned to her side. This joy made her exceptionally excited. Her lips moved, and she kept saying something to Feng Nu and Lan Chen.\n\nMu Jing gave Nian Bing a meaningful glance and said, \"Brother Nian, you truly have good fortune!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled without speaking. Looking at the three women who had come with him, he couldn't help but feel a sense of contentment. It was such a fortunate thing to have them as his wives!\n\nZhamulun naturally saw the three women, Feng Nu, and the other two. The previous Lan Chen had already shocked him greatly. Then there were Feng Nu and Long Ling. An undisguised look of intense jealousy flashed in his eyes. He said coldly, \"Indeed, good fortune. However, it remains to be seen if one can protect their good fortune.\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"I have some confidence in that. Miss Mu Jing, besides the High Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess, the rest of us who came to attend the conference are all here. I heard that Miss brought quite a few people this time, so you need to be careful. This is, after all, the territory of the Hua Rong Empire.\"\n\nA hint of hatred flashed in Mu Jing's eyes. She clearly remembered the fate of her subordinates after participating in the previous Mage Competition. \"Brother Nian, don't forget, we are here to attend peace talks.\"\n\nZhamulun snorted disdainfully and said, \"I truly didn't expect the Ice Moon Empire to send such a young brat as their envoy. I'd like to see where your confidence comes from.\" His hand on the table moved slightly, and a blue light shot out like lightning. Mu Jing tried to stop him, but it was too late. The blue light drew an arc and flew straight towards Nian Bing's chest.\n\n\"Mmm, delicious, truly delicious!\" Xi Lu, after finishing a bowl of porridge, stretched his arm subconsciously. His hand happened to be raised, blocking the blue light. The blue light disappeared silently, as if nothing had happened. Xi Lu then served himself another bowl of fresh porridge with a lot of toppings and continued his feasting.\n\nLuo Rou frowned and said coldly, \"Jingjing, what do you mean by this?\" (Zichen Palace hand-typed)\n\nMu Jing gave Zhamulun a dissatisfied look, but she didn't dare to act out. She could only say, \"I'm sorry, my master always likes to speak through actions. Please forgive me, Brother Nian, for any offense.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"It's nothing. However, I find it strange that the master hasn't spoken, but the dog is barking wildly?\"\n\nA cold glint flashed in Zhamulun's eyes, and a sinister light flickered. \"Dog? This is the first time I've heard someone describe me like this. Good, very good!\" A smile appeared on his face. Although he was smiling, his aura was already fluctuating invisibly. He slowly stood up from his seat, and the chair he had been sitting on silently turned into dust.\n\n\"Master,\" Mu Jing cried out urgently, quickly grabbing Zhamulun, \"Master, have you forgotten what you promised me?\"\n\nZhamulun frowned, cast a cold glance at Nian Bing, and said, \"Fine, we will have opportunities to meet again.\" With that, he lightly patted the table and turned to leave. Mu Jing quickly said, \"I'm sorry, everyone. Mu Jing will apologize to everyone another day.\" After saying that, she quickly followed him out.\n\nThe moment Mu Jing stepped out of the door, Xi Lu suddenly grabbed his porridge pot. The large dining table in front of him, including all the utensils on the table, instantly turned into ashes.\n\nA hint of surprise flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. Yu Ruyan stood up and snorted coldly, about to follow them out, but Nian Bing stopped her, \"Mom, why bother with people like this?\"\n\nYu Ruyan looked at the dust on the ground and said, \"This person is very strong. When Rou'er and I first met him, I already felt that his aura was by no means comparable to ordinary people.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Indeed, he is very strong. I can almost be sure that he is not from the Lang Mu Empire.\"\n\nXi Lu drank the remaining porridge in his pot, wiped his mouth, and said, \"Nian Bing, your judgment is correct. Although I haven't met this person before, his aura clearly comes from the same place as mine.\" From the moment he sensed Zhamulun's powerful battle aura, Nian Bing had already begun to doubt his identity. Later, seeing the jealous look in Zhamulun's eyes, his provocative words, and his subsequent attack, and finally this angry palm strike, Nian Bing had completely judged his strength. Zhamulun was about what he had imagined, and his strength was no less than Xi Lu's.\n\nLong Ling looked at the shattered pieces on the ground and said, \"Alright, there are no outsiders now. Rou Rou, I heard from Nian Bing that you became Prime Minister. That's amazing!\"\n\nLuo Rou sighed softly and said, \"Amazing? Actually, as a woman, I am far less fortunate than you.\" As she spoke, she glanced at Nian Bing beside her.\n\nNian Bing's heart lurched. He had seen some clues in Luo Rou's gaze. He knew that with so many confidantes, he couldn't afford to get involved in any more romantic entanglements. He quickly averted his gaze and said to Yu Ruyan, \"Mom, I've returned your daughter to you this time. You've lost weight.\"\n\nYu Ruyan smiled and said, \"Chen Chen has already told me everything about you. You lucky boy, promise Mom that you will take good care of them for me in the future.\"\n\nNian Bing said seriously, \"I will. Mom, don't worry, unless I die, I will never let anyone harm them.\"\n\nYu Ruyan took Lan Chen and Feng Nu's hands and brought them to Nian Bing, placing those two slender jade hands into Nian Bing's palm. \"Last time, you were willing to sacrifice your life to save Chen Chen, so how could I doubt you? Earlier, you told Mu Jing that you were representing the Hua Rong Empire. Is this true?\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing nodded and said, \"It's true. Mom, there are no outsiders here, so I'll be direct. That's right, I do have a connection with the Rong family. Prince Rong is my biological grandfather. Although I was separated from the Rong family from a young age, I am still a member of the Rong family. However, my visit this time is indeed for the Bingyue Empire, and also for Aolan.\"\n\nYu Ruyan asked in surprise, \"What do you plan to do? Nian Bing, the situation is very chaotic now, and it might not be easy to control. For us in the Aolan Empire, it is not beneficial whether the Huarong Empire becomes stronger or the Langmu Empire uses the current opportunity to weaken the Huarong Empire. Therefore, although Rou'er has decided to form an alliance with the Langmu Empire, she is unwilling to send troops.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"I agree with Miss Luo Rou. An alliance is imperative, but sending troops is not necessary. With an alliance of the three empires, the Huarong Empire would not dare to offend lightly. This would create a stalemate between north and south, and such a balanced situation would be perfect. If one side were to dominate, it would be no benefit to Aolan or Bingyue. I believe in Miss Luo Rou's abilities; her wisdom is far greater than mine in this regard.\"\n\nLuo Rou said with some dissatisfaction, \"Stop calling me 'Miss' all the time. Can't you call me anything else? Ling'er and I are good friends, so you can call me Rou'er too. When it comes to wisdom, I can't compare to you.\"\n\nYu Ruyan looked at Luo Rou in surprise. Since Luo Rou came to the Aolan Empire, she had displayed her wisdom in all aspects, earning the favor of the King of Aolan Empire. This led to her being specially appointed as Prime Minister. With her own abilities, Luo Rou, with the support of Duke Lan Yu, had accomplished several major tasks in just one year, making all the officials submit to her, and she finally became a powerful minister in the Aolan Empire, second only to the emperor. In more than two years, this was the first time Yu Ruyan had seen Luo Rou reveal such a girlish demeanor; her usual wise appearance was nowhere to be seen.\n\nNian Bing said awkwardly, \"Miss Luo Rou, please don't joke with me. I am also coming here as a representative of the Bingyue Empire out of necessity. How can my wisdom compare to that of Miss Luo Rou? I believe that you have already planned out the development strategy for the Aolan Empire for a long time to come. Aolan borders the Qilu Empire. The situation in Qilu is unstable now, and these next few years are a good opportunity for great development. I believe you won't miss such an opportunity. As for the Bingyue Empire, it has always been peaceful and friendly with Aolan. I believe our two countries can form the most steadfast alliance.\" He was not being humble; he had some confidence in handling major affairs, but to make a country gradually stronger like Luo Rou was something he could never achieve. He would rather endure tedious cultivation than get too involved in power struggles. His reason for coming as an envoy for the Bingyue Empire was twofold: first, his guilt towards Yan Feng, and second, for the sake of Yu Ruyan's family in the Aolan Empire. Nian Bing clearly understood that his greatest flaw was his deep emotional attachment. In the face of emotions, everything else could be set aside. Therefore, it was destined that he would never become a ruler. Of course, he never thought of correcting this flaw; without it, he wouldn't have had his three beloved wives.\n\nLuo Rou nodded and said, \"I've had this idea for a long time, but since the new Emperor of the Bingyue Empire ascended the throne, the situation has been quite chaotic. It has only recently begun to calm down. I never expected to misjudge Yan Feng and that he would become the new ruler of the Bingyue Empire. After I return this time, I will immediately send an envoy to the Bingyue Empire to discuss the alliance with your country. My current concern is that our two countries have a very long border. Although we are allied, it would be difficult to help each other if something were to happen.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"You can rest assured about this, Miss Luo Rou. Since I proposed the alliance, I naturally have some confidence. If the Huarong and Langmu Empires make any moves, I will definitely inform you in advance, Miss Luo Rou, so that you can prepare. Our two countries will support each other, and as long as we develop for a period of time, it won't be long before we become strong. Miss, you are still young. I believe that in a few decades, the continent will be in a different state.\"\n\nLuo Rou said with some dissatisfaction, \"Why do you still call me 'Miss' all the time? Is it that difficult to call me by my name?\"\n\nNian Bing said solemnly, \"We are discussing important matters now. Miss Luo Rou, there's something I'd like to discuss with you privately. Feng Nü, please ask the waiter to set up another table and get some porridge. You two eat first. I'll speak with Rou'er and be right back.\"\n\nYu Ruyan looked at Nian Bing in surprise. She didn't understand why Nian Bing wanted to speak with Luo Rou privately when everyone present was family. Nian Bing gave Yu Ruyan an apologetic nod before turning to leave. Luo Rou also felt some confusion. Firstly, she didn't understand why Nian Bing was so confident about the alliance between the two countries. Secondly, she harbored the same doubts as Yu Ruyan.\n\nFeng Nü asked no questions and immediately did as Nian Bing said. Nian Bing led Luo Rou out of the private room and stopped in a secluded corner of the corridor.\n\nTurning around, Nian Bing used his mental power to create a circular barrier to enclose both of them before saying, \"Rou'er, can you trust me?\"\n\nLuo Rou had already guessed that Nian Bing had called her out to say something important. She smiled and said, \"What is there not to trust? If not for you, I probably would have already married the deceased Fifth Prince. Rou'er will never forget your kindness. Being able to control my own destiny has always been my greatest wish. Just say what you need to say. Even if I cannot fulfill it, I will not reveal a single word.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Good, I trust you. Rou'er, what is your view on the general situation of the world?\"\n\nLuo Rou thought for a moment and said, \"Although there are many countries on the continent of Yangguang now, the only true power is the Huarong Empire. Although I have tried my best, it is impossible for the Aolan Empire to achieve a qualitative leap in a short period. It will take a long time for the Aolan Empire to grow. Overall, Huarong is powerful. Emperor Huatian, with Prime Minister Su Yue and Prince Rong assisting him in both civil and military affairs, is at the peak of his power. Even if the three empires join forces this time, I am not optimistic about the final outcome. It is very difficult to inflict serious damage on the Huarong Empire. Then there is the Langmu Empire. Do not underestimate them. Although the Langmu Empire was defeated by the Huarong Empire unexpectedly last time, the Langmu Empire was the wealthiest of the original five empires and has accumulated extremely strong power over many years. Although not as strong as Huarong, the difference is not significant. It is precisely because of this that Prince Rong adopted the strategy of striking precisely and then immediately retreating. As for the Bingyue Empire, although it is stronger than our Aolan Empire, what truly gives you your natural position is the Ice God Tower with its large number of mages, and the cold weather in the north. The Huarong Empire, located in the south, would have to pay the greatest price if it wanted to conquer the Bingyue Empire. From a commercial perspective, the current situation is very delicate. If I were Emperor Huatian, after this peace talk, I would mobilize the entire country to quickly pacify the Qilu Empire and use all resources to develop the military. Then, I would launch an attack on Aolan, using the mountains as a barrier to block the Langmu Empire. At that time, with Prince Rong's decisive actions, as long as the main forces of the two countries were defeated, unifying the continent would be within reach. Conquering Qilu is a risky move, but I truly admire Prince Rong's courage and ability. The Huarong Empire paid a much smaller price than I imagined. I have considered many countermeasures, but the biggest problem now is the inability to grasp the true internal situation of the Huarong Empire and make corresponding preparations.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"You are right. The most important issue lies here, and I have also considered it carefully. The Huarong Empire will need at least two years to completely annex Qilu. Within two years, you can also do many things. As you said, the biggest lack for both the Aolan Empire and the Langmu Empire is intelligence from the Huarong Empire's side. Once the three empires form an alliance, Aolan can gather its army with Langmu on the border. In this way, it will not be easy for the Huarong Empire to attack. Therefore, I hope that after this peace talk, we will unite with Langmu but not attack the Huarong Empire. The Langmu Empire fears most that the Huarong Empire will use Aolan as a springboard to attack them from the plains, in which case the Huarong Empire's powerful cavalry would be something they could not resist. You can use this to demand a large amount of resources from the Langmu Empire and build defensive fortifications on the border with the Huarong Empire. Before coming here, I carefully studied the map. Although the border between Aolan and Qilu does not have large mountain ranges, there are some small mountains, and holding defensive positions in the mountains is the best choice. Build more fortresses and support each other, and it will not be easy for the Huarong Empire to make a breakthrough. Although the Bingyue Empire does not have as many resources as the Langmu Empire, it produces various ores and is skilled in forging equipment. It can provide you with more equipment. Within two years, as long as you can establish a solid defense line in Aolan, it will surely deter the Huarong Empire from taking risks.\"\n\nLuo Rou chuckled and said, \"You still say you are not as wise as me? What you are thinking is exactly what I am thinking, and it is the best method I could think of. The Langmu Empire will naturally agree, and with you on the Bingyue Empire's side, there should be no problem. However, the Prime Minister of Huarong Empire, Su Yue, is known for his wisdom and is skilled in sophistry, coupled with Prince Rong's two elite cavalry regiments, I'm afraid...\"\n\nNian Bing asked, \"If you can know the movements of the Huarong Empire's army in advance, what chance do you have of defending?\"\n\nLuo Rou looked at Nian Bing in surprise. \"At least seven tenths. If the Langmu Empire cooperates well, it could even be eight or nine tenths. In war, intelligence comes first. If you can grasp the enemy's troop movements and utilize them wisely, even if our country is weaker, the chances of success will be much greater. Nian Bing, I don't understand, why do you seem to be targeting the Huarong Empire? Didn't you just admit that you are from the Rong family?\"\n\nNian Bing sighed and said, \"The situation on the continent has nothing to do with me. I just like a free and unrestrained life. However, my relatives and friends are forced to get involved. If I tell you that I decided to help you like this for Duke Lan Yu and my godmother Yu Ruyan, would you be surprised?\"\n\nLuo Rou shook her head and said, \"I wouldn't be. I've heard about your past from Auntie. You're not just doing this for them, but also for Feng Nü and Lan Chen. Nian Bing, I now understand what kind of person you are. However, I believe you are not helping me unconditionally. Otherwise, you could have said all this in front of Aunt Yu Ruyan. State your request, but you must provide proof that I can trust, for the sake of the Aolan Empire.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"That's right, I do have a request. This request might be difficult for you, but I can assure you that I will never do anything that harms the Aolan Empire during your lifetime.\"\n\nLuo Rou said, \"I believe that. You wouldn't do that for Aunt Yu's family either. What is your request?\"\n\nA glint flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. \"I would like you to help me place my people in the Aolan Empire's political circles, allowing them to gradually occupy important positions. Of course, they will fully support you in all aspects. Unless something major happens, I will not deploy these people.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" Although Luo Rou had thought of many possibilities, she did not expect Nian Bing to make such a request. She looked at Nian Bing in horror. \"Do you want to control the Aolan Empire?\"\n\nNian Bing said frankly, \"In a sense, yes. However, I don't want to harm anyone in the Aolan Empire. It's just to leave a fallback for my own family. This is also why I am willing to risk greatly to help the Bingyue Empire and do things that are detrimental to the Huarong Empire.\"\n\nLuo Rou took a deep breath. \"Nian Bing, do you know, if it weren't for your previous words, I would really think you were a modern-day hero. It's a pity, but you are not.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Thank you for the compliment. Power is like floating clouds to me. I just want to protect my relatives and friends, allowing them to always have a fallback. In fact, within the next year, our world might undergo significant changes, and the extent of these changes is hard to say. Perhaps, one day, all the countries on the continent will have to unite. However, I really don't want to see that day come. Rou'er, are you willing to help me? Whether it's for Aolan or for Aunt Yu's family.\"",

    "content": "Suddenly, Luo Rou smiled and stepped forward, stopping about a foot away from Nian Bing. Nian Bing could clearly smell her virgin fragrance. His handsome face turned slightly red, and he wanted to retreat, but his back was already against the wall. Luo Rou said, \"Nian Bing, you don't actually understand. Firstly, I am not from the Oran Empire. The reason I help the Oran Empire so much is to repay the kindness of Aunt Yu's family in saving my family, and also to make my wisdom useful. The Oran Empire's situation with other countries and its own circumstances are like a game of chess, and I am just someone who enjoys playing chess. However, I can also discard all of this at any time. For me, these things are not absolutely important. Secondly, although we have only met twice, you have helped me immensely. The future of the Oran Empire has little to do with me. I owe you, and I will definitely repay it. You don't need to give any reason. If you came to me alone and asked me to say this, I would still agree, even if it were just for what I owe you. Therefore, you don't need to say anything more. I promise to fulfill your condition. With the Oran King's trust in me, installing a few people is nothing. The Oran Empire is lacking in talented people. However, I am curious now, what makes you able to tell me the most accurate military intelligence of the Hua Rong Empire, and what forces are behind you?\"\n\nLooking at Luo Rou and listening to her words, Nian Bing felt a warmth in his heart. He hadn't expected Luo Rou to value him so much. The bet he made with Luo Rou when he first arrived in Ice Snow City seemed like it was just yesterday. \"Rou'er, I think I only need to say five words to be enough.\"\n\n\"What five words?\" Luo Rou's expression couldn't help but show a trace of curiosity.\n\nNian Bing said word by word, \"Blood — Lion — Cult — Cult — Master —\"\n\n\"What?\" Luo Rou exclaimed in shock, her eyes filled with horror. She looked at Nian Bing in astonishment, covering her mouth with a look of disbelief.\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"It's my honor to be able to surprise Miss Luo Rou, the 'Wise Woman,' like this.\"\n\nLuo Rou stared blankly at Nian Bing. Of course, she knew the name \"Blood Lion Cult.\" As the Prime Minister of the Oran Empire, she had analyzed the continental situation countless times. She had heard the name \"Blood Lion Cult\" more than once and had sent people to investigate it thoroughly, but had not obtained any useful information. However, the vastness and mystery of the Blood Lion Cult had greatly shocked her. The scale of this underground organization, the meticulousness of its operations, and the loyalty of its members were all greatly admired by her. Although she didn't know the specific size of the Blood Lion Cult, she deeply felt the terror of this organization.\n\n\"You say you are the Cult Master of the Blood Lion Cult?\" Luo Rou's voice held a hint of bewilderment.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Yes, I've held this position for two years.\"\n\nLuo Rou took a deep breath, her eyes regaining clarity. \"What a formidable Rong family, what a formidable Prince Rong! Nian Bing, tell me honestly, were you specially trained by the Rong family?\"\n\nNian Bing knew that with Luo Rou's intelligence, she must have guessed many things. He shook his head and said, \"No. I was not trained by the Rong family. Back then, I left the Rong family with my father. I only returned during the Kingdom's New Talent Magician Competition last time. Grandpa valued me greatly. Not only did he take me back into the Rong family, but he also handed over the Blood Lion Cult to me. You can rest assured about one thing: other members of the Rong family do not know about the existence of the Blood Lion Cult. Only the successive Patriarchs of the Rong family are privy to this secret, and the Blood Lion Cult is not controlled by the Rong family. Therefore, you should understand what I mean. The Blood Lion Cult is an organization that I fully control. The intelligence network of the Blood Lion Cult spans the entire continent. The groundwork I am laying now is for the future of the Rong family. With your intelligence, you will naturally understand my intentions.\"\n\n\"En, I understand. You telling me this shows your trust in me. Luo Rou promises you, after I return to the country, you can send someone to contact me. Let this item be proof. However, I have a small request. Please don't misunderstand, it's just a request. Even if you don't agree, I will still help you.\" As she spoke, she took off a necklace from her neck and handed it to Nian Bing. The pendant on the necklace was a teardrop-shaped red gem, like a tear of blood. The necklace was simple, with a string that resembled silver thread, but it was much brighter than silver.\n\nThe necklace, when it entered his hand, still carried Luo Rou's body heat and a faint fragrance. Nian Bing looked deeply at Luo Rou. \"Do you need something so precious?\" He could clearly feel pure fire element contained within this gem. Although the energy of the gem was not as potent as the Fire God Stone on the Zhengyang Saber, its purity was even greater.\n\nLuo Rou smiled, \"If it's not something special, how can we prevent impersonation? The pendant on this necklace can be removed. Consider it my favor owed to you. Anytime you need my help, just bring this gem to me, and I will do my best to assist you. As for this time, consider it interest. Have your people bring the necklace when they come, and you can keep the pendant for now. This 'Tear of Blood' is an heirloom from my mother, it is unique, and no one can impersonate it.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Luo Rou, a little dazed. \"This is too precious. How can I repay you with your mother's heirloom?\"\n\nLuo Rou sighed softly, \"Don't you want to ask what my request is?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"What is your request? As long as I can do it, I will do my best to help you.\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled, \"Actually, this is a very simple matter for you. When I help the Oran Empire become stronger, and after I have arranged for your people to be in high positions, I hope you can reserve a place for me where you and Ling'er and the others will live in seclusion. Is that okay?\"\n\nNian Bing's body trembled. He looked at Luo Rou, who was smiling, and for a moment, he didn't know how to answer her. This, was this a confession? But…\n\n\"Don't misunderstand, I don't want to compete with Ling'er for a man. I just want you to provide me with a place to stay.\"\n\nNian Bing's brain suddenly became sluggish. He asked foolishly, \"You are the Prime Minister of the Oran Empire. How can it be difficult for you to find a place to live?\"\n\nLuo Rou glared at him fiercely. \"Just say yes or no. Must I explicitly say that I want to come to your place to mooch meals?\"\n\nNian Bing said with a wry smile, \"Your request is a bit frivolous. Alright, after I decide to go into seclusion in the future, I will tell you the address first. As long as you are willing to come, there will always be a room for you.\"\n\nLuo Rou spread her small hand and offered it to Nian Bing. Nian Bing looked at her in surprise. \"What are you doing?\"\n\nLuo Rou chided, \"Why are you suddenly so foolish? A token of exchange! If you don't give me a token, how will I command your subordinates in the future? How will they believe me?\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned again. A token of exchange, what could he give Luo Rou? She had given him such a precious thing. If it were something ordinary, how could he present it? But he couldn't possibly give her the Seven Divine Sabers or the Blood Lion Cult's leader token. What should he give? He was really undecided, but looking at the fair and tender little hand in front of him, he couldn't refuse.\n\nGritting his teeth, the Space Ring on Nian Bing's hand glowed slightly. The small cloth bag appeared in his palm. Seeing this cloth bag, Luo Rou's eyes lit up. She had certainly seen this cloth bag before. The first time Nian Bing displayed his culinary skills, it was this cloth bag that deeply shocked everyone present.\n\nNian Bing opened the cloth bag and flicked his fingers. A medium-sized \"Ghost Carving\" knife appeared between his right index and middle fingers, with the blade inside and the handle facing outward, and he handed it to Luo Rou. \"The 'Ghost Carving' is one of the most precious things left to me by my master. Only with it can it barely compare to Miss's token of exchange.\"\n\nLuo Rou eagerly clasped the \"Ghost Carving\" in her hand, looking at the exquisite patterns on the small blade and feeling the faint chill. Her pretty face was filled with an excited smile. \"I will definitely take good care of it. But, will giving me this knife affect your cooking skills?\"\n\nNian Bing said with a wry smile, \"Do you think I have time to cook now? Don't worry, the 'Ghost Carving' is versatile. With my current ability, even if I condensed a ice blade with magic, I could achieve the same effect. I will tell my subordinates that whoever sees this knife is to treat it as seeing me, and to obey your commands.\"\n\nA hint of tenderness flashed in Luo Rou's beautiful eyes. \"Remember your promise. When you go into seclusion, you must leave me a room.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"I will do what I promised. Alright, let's go back. Don't keep them waiting too long.\" He didn't caution Luo Rou about anything because he knew that with Luo Rou's intelligence and wisdom, she would naturally know what to do. After speaking, he released the mental power seal on the surrounding space and walked back first.\n\nLooking at Nian Bing's retreating figure, a deep look of longing filled Luo Rou's eyes. \"Fool, why are you so clueless in this regard? Don't you understand what it means for a girl to give a token of exchange? If it weren't for you, why would I have made such a request?\" She carefully put the \"Ghost Carving\" into her clothes and followed Nian Bing.\n\nBack then, when Nian Bing won the bet, Luo Rou had already set her sights on him. But what truly touched Luo Rou was the first time Nian Bing displayed his culinary skills and created that divine dish—the \"Nine Azure Divine Dragon Ice Cloud Hidden.\" Nian Bing's peerless knife skills and focused expression had already captured the heart of this wise woman. However, she was a proud girl, and how could she speak of such things? Especially today, when she saw Feng Nü and Lan Chen, who were even more beautiful than herself, her hope became even dimmer. But she was unwilling to give up, so she made her request when Nian Bing made his suggestion.\n\nWhen they returned to the room, Yu Ruyan looked at Nian Bing with a different expression, but she didn't say much. Feng Nü and the others were eating porridge. Seeing them return, they quickly beckoned them to join them. Among them, Xi Lu ate the most heartily, finishing three large pots of porridge before patting his stomach contentedly.\n\n\"Mom, let Feng Nü, Chen Chen, and Ling'er accompany you to tour Du Tian City. I still have some things to do.\"\n\nYu Ruyan nodded. \"You do your work. Rou'er and I are also staying at the State Guesthouse, and we will return together.\"\n\nNian Bing pinched Lan Chen's hand next to him and transmitted to her with his mental power, \"You go back and discuss it. Sleep with me tonight. Hehe, I'm going to sneak attack tonight.\" Then, before Lan Chen could playfully protest, he pulled the well-fed Xi Lu and ran out.\n\nLong Ling saw Lan Chen's face turn red after Nian Bing whispered something to her. She couldn't help but ask, \"Chen Chen, what did Nian Bing say? Why is your face red?\"\n\nLan Chen glanced at Long Ling. She couldn't tell the truth in front of her mother, so she said irritably, \"He? What good could he say? He just bullies me.\"\n\nFeng Nü looked at her sister and said with a light smile, \"Is that so? Alright, tonight we'll wait for him to come back and punish him properly.\"\n\nLuo Rou looked at the intimate atmosphere between the three women and Nian Bing, and her heart felt a little disheartened, but she didn't show it on the surface. She smiled and said, \"Alright, we've all eaten. Let's go out for a walk. It's my first time in Du Tian City too.\"\n\nNian Bing and Xi Lu left the porridge shop. Xi Lu marveled, \"Brother, this place you recommended is really good. Although it's not as delicious as your cooking, it's very characteristic.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Brother, you're getting more and more capable of eating. Are you going to have a second puberty?\"\n\nXi Lu said indignantly, \"Puberty my foot! I'm hundreds of years old, what puberty am I having? Oh, right, do you feel it?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"That Zha Mu Lun should be the one sent by the Divine Continent to find the sealed bottle of Mo Audas. Brother Xi Lu, there are some things I can no longer hide from you. Actually...\" As he spoke, he led Xi Lu towards the city center and briefly explained the matter of the sealed bottle of Mo Audas.\n\nAfter listening to Nian Bing, Xi Lu excitedly said, \"Brother, you mean, you mean there's a possibility of returning to my homeland?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Theoretically, yes. However, I can't be completely sure right now. Because the possibility of returning from the Lost Continent is very slim. With the Seven Dragon Kings guarding it, the guy who stole the sealed bottle of Mo Audas was already having a hard time. Now the Divine Continent has also sent many divine beings, and their combined strength is enough to sweep across the entire Yangguang Continent.\"\n\nXi Lu suddenly stopped and looked at Nian Bing sternly. \"Brother, do you also think our Lost Continent should not return?\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing looked back at him and said, \"It used to be, but ever since I learned about the grievances between the Divine Continent and the Lost Continent, and visited the Divine Continent once, my thoughts have long since changed. From my own perspective, if it weren't for the potential variables caused by the return of the Lost Continent, I would very much hope for it to return. At least, the Lost Continent could restrain the Divine Continent. The Yangguang Continent would then be safe. Compared to the Divine Continent, don't you think this continent is a pure land for all sorts of creatures? This might be the last pure land.\"\n\nXie Lu walked to Nian Bing's side, \"I understand what you mean. Actually, you're conflicted. However, whether you are willing to help me or not, I will treat you as a brother. I just hope you can tell me the location of the decisive battle.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at him deeply and said, \"Have you decided to stand with Xie Yue?\"\n\nXie Lu shook his head, \"No, I only stand with the Lost Continent.\"\n\nAlthough Nian Bing had already anticipated Xie Lu's reaction, when it actually happened, he felt a sense of difficulty. He sighed softly and said, \"Brother, no matter what, I will be present there, and I may not necessarily bring you. As for my stance, let me think about it again, okay?\"\n\nXie Lu's eyes glistened with tears. The opportunity that the Dwarf race had longed for for tens of thousands of years was about to arrive. His obsession made it impossible for him to give up this chance. He nodded gently and said nothing more.\n\nThe two continued to walk forward. Nian Bing's heart suddenly moved, and he sent a telepathic message to Xie Lu, \"Brother, someone is following us.\"\n\nXie Lu was still immersed in what Nian Bing had said. Upon being reminded, he quickly focused. As Nian Bing had said, by coordinating his fighting spirit and mental power, he could feel a faint aura trailing them about a hundred zhang behind. He nodded to Nian Bing and said, \"It should be him.\"\n\nNian Bing felt a strong killing intent from Xie Lu, knowing that he was truly angered. \"That envoy sent by the Divine Continent should have been investigating the matter of the Bottle of Moertas' Seal. Why would he be mixed with people from the Langmu Empire, and even become Mu Jing's master?\"\n\nXie Lu said coldly, \"Let me go and take care of him.\"\n\nSeeing that Xie Lu was about to make a move, Nian Bing quickly pressed his broad shoulder and said, \"No. This is within Dutian City, we can't make a move. Brother, I understand your feelings. However, we cannot be too hasty. Let's lure him out of the city first.\" He also had no good feelings towards the gods from the Divine Continent, let alone the fact that this Zamu Lun had become Mu Jing's greatest helper.\n\nMaintaining their direction, Nian Bing continued forward. When he passed a magic item shop, he took Xie Lu inside with him.\n\n\"What would you gentlemen like? This humble shop has all sorts of premium magic items. Fair prices.\" The server, seeing that Nian Bing and Xie Lu's attire was ordinary, but their demeanor was far from ordinary, quickly and fawningly greeted them.\n\nNian Bing said indifferently, \"Continental Winds, Lion's Might.\" He naturally was not afraid of other customers in the shop hearing him; the telepathic transmission was directly in the other person's mind.\n\nThe server stiffened all over, but quickly recovered and said in a low voice, \"May I ask what color weapons you prefer, sir?\"\n\nNian Bing replied, \"Crimson gold.\"\n\nNian Bing glared at him, \"What? You don't have it here?\"\n\nThe server had calmed down by this time. He quickly said, \"We do have it, but the price...\"\n\nNian Bing turned to the server, blocking the view of others in the shop with his body. A red light flickered in his palm. He flashed it in front of the server, and only the server and Xie Lu saw it: it was an exquisite red jade lion. \"I want crimson gold. Prepare seven crimson gold weapons for me. I'll pick them up in an hour. Remember to have the weapon smiths come over. I want to ask them about some forging questions.\"\n\nThe server's attitude became exceptionally respectful, and he quickly said, \"Yes, yes, I will inform them.\"\n\nNian Bing patted the somewhat bewildered Xie Lu and said, \"Brother, let's go.\" With that, he took Xie Lu and left the magic item shop, heading towards the city gates.\n\nXie Lu sent a confused telepathic message, \"Brother, why are you still buying weapons? Your seven swords are already the best.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Brother, that's the code of my Blood Lion Sect. The crimson gold I mentioned represents my identity. When I said I wanted seven items and specified the smiths to come, I actually meant for him to ask the elders of our sect to wait for me here. Alright, let's pick up the pace and get rid of the trouble first.\" The two never looked back and headed directly towards the nearest West Gate. At their level of expertise, once a battle commenced, it could generate immense power. The mere ripple effect of energy could cause great destruction and potentially harm civilians, which Nian Bing did not wish to see.\n\nWhen they arrived outside the city, the previously clear sky was already covered by a layer of dark clouds, and the warm air brought a hint of chill. Nian Bing and Xie Lu continued to walk forward. Nian Bing could clearly feel the killing intent in Xie Lu's heart steadily rising. For the dwarves, who were once part of the Lost Continent, the gods were their greatest enemies.\n\nNian Bing and Xie Lu exchanged a glance. Xie Lu understood, and the two simultaneously unleashed their figures. Xie Lu relied on his fighting spirit, while Nian Bing relied on his incredibly strong physique. Their speed increased dramatically, leaving two faint afterimages in the air.\n\nZamu Lun, who had been following them, could no longer hide his presence. He quickly accelerated his pace to chase after the two. In fact, because he came from the Divine Continent, he was overly confident. Otherwise, at this moment, from the speed of Nian Bing and Xie Lu, he should have realized that these two were not easy to deal with. Unfortunately, excessive arrogance and the notion of being a god prevented him from noticing these things.\n\nAlthough Nian Bing and Xie Lu were not running at full speed, their pace was still considerable. He was very familiar with the terrain around Dutian City. When they passed through a forest on the official road and arrived at a small hill, they immediately stopped.\n\nNian Bing stood still and glanced at Xie Lu. Xie Lu was also looking at him, and both saw the coldness in each other's eyes. A faint multicolored light emanated from Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye acupoint. Without looking back, he calmly said, \"Brother Zamu Lun, you've followed us long enough. Come out.\"\n\nWith a flash, Zamu Lun drifted out and stopped about ten zhang away from the two. He had followed them not to cause trouble for Nian Bing, but at Mu Jing's request. Mu Jing still harbored some fear of Nian Bing, so she had asked Zamu Lun to secretly follow Nian Bing and observe his movements. This was a critical time before the Four Nations Assembly, and she hoped to keep track of Nian Bing's whereabouts. Unfortunately, she did not know that Nian Bing, fueled by a deep hatred for gods, and Xie Lu, who had no good feelings for selfish gods, had already developed killing intent due to Zamu Lun's shadowing.\n\n\"You can detect me?\" Zamu Lun said with some surprise, as he casually walked towards Nian Bing and Xie Lu, a faint green fighting spirit emanating from his body. Since Mu Jing had repeatedly warned him not to harm Nian Bing at this time, he only intended to teach them a lesson and probe their capabilities.\n\nIn Nian Bing's perception, this Zamu Lun seemed somewhat similar to the Wind God who had opposed the Holy Master back then. However, what he possessed was not just fighting spirit; the wind attribute fighting spirit also contained strong wind elements. Although not as pure as the Wind God's energy, it had its own characteristics.\n\nNian Bing slowly turned around. When Zamu Lun saw the colorful Heavenly Eye acupoint on his forehead, his heart tightened, and he immediately understood why the other party could sense his presence. However, he was not overly nervous. After all, this was just the Yangguang Continent, not the Divine Continent. With his divine-level strength, he naturally would not fear two people from the Yangguang Continent.\n\nNian Bing smiled indifferently and said, \"Brother Zamu Lun has been following us two brothers. Do you have any advice?\"\n\nZamu Lun snorted coldly and said, \"Your outward appearance is indeed good. I didn't expect there to be so many beauties in this world.\" He was deeply impressed by Feng Nu, Long Ling, and Lan Chen. Seeing Nian Bing's handsome appearance, he was filled with jealousy.\n\nListening to Zamu Lun's irrelevant response, Nian Bing couldn't help but frown slightly. Especially when he saw the lustful glint in Zamu Lun's eyes, his anger surged. He suddenly said, \"Life on the Yangguang Continent is much better than on the Divine Continent, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Of course, it's like the separation of heaven and hell... You, how do you know I'm from the Divine Continent?\" Realizing he had let slip, Zamu Lun's killing intent surged, and the surrounding vegetation trembled under the intense killing aura emanating from him.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Brother Zamu Lun, there's no need to be nervous. Actually, I only arrived a few days later than you.\"\n\nZamu Lun was stunned and said, \"You're also a god? How have I never met you? Clearly, there's no one like you among those who have come.\"\n\nNian Bing asked, \"You came to the Yangguang Continent to find the whereabouts of the Bottle of Moertas' Seal, didn't you? Why are you mixed with people from the Langmu Empire? Brother Zamu Lun, can you give me an explanation?\"\n\nZamu Lun's expression changed slightly, \"You know quite a lot. What about you? Since you are also a god, why have you become a representative of a country?\"\n\nSeeing his somewhat embarrassed expression, Nian Bing suddenly understood something. \"Life on the Yangguang Continent is indeed good. For someone like you to attach yourself to a country, enjoy beautiful pleasures, and investigate along the way, it seems that Brother Zamu Lun is a smart person.\"\n\nZamu Lun snorted coldly and said, \"Kid, you're not sent by the Main God to monitor us, are you? You still haven't answered my question.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"What? Embarrassed and angry? It's very simple to answer your question. I was never a god, nor do I have any connection with those so-called Main Gods. I am a human, a human on the Yangguang Continent. Is it only allowed for you gods to come to the Yangguang Continent, and not for me to go to the Divine Continent?\"\n\nZamu Lun was surprised and said, \"You are human?\"\n\nNian Bing, before he could ask further, immediately said, \"What about the people who came with you? Are they all like you?\"\n\nZamu Lun looked coldly at Nian Bing, the wind attribute fighting spirit around his body intensifying. \"You want to trick me? Don't dream. I didn't intend to kill you, but since you know my background so well, I can't let you live.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"It's okay if you don't say it now, but I heard that gods are very afraid of death. I think you'll open your mouth soon.\" As soon as he finished speaking, Zamu Lun suddenly raised his right hand and chopped over with a light palm. The greatest characteristic of wind attribute fighting spirit is speed and sharpness. A green light flashed, and a wind blade flew directly towards Nian Bing's head. This was no ordinary magic wind blade. The vast energy contained within it seemed to completely cleave the air, and the air around the green light was distorted.\n\nXie Lu shouted loudly, stepping to the side with his left foot and appearing in front of Nian Bing. He had been impatient for some time. His black battle axe suddenly swung up, and black fighting spirit was not outward at all. He met the wind blade's attack head-on.\n\nWith a booming sound, Xie Lu stood his ground, while a layer of green energy appeared on Zamu Lun's face. He subconsciously took two steps back, clearly at a disadvantage.\n\nNian Bing couldn't help but be a little surprised. Xie Lu's battle axe was not an ordinary weapon; it was a divine artifact that the dwarf masters had spent countless efforts to forge, and it had a special bonus effect on fighting spirit. This short-handled, broad-bladed battle axe was only suitable for dwarves and was called the God-Slaying Axe. Its attack power was extremely formidable. Zamu Lun's attack was, after all, with bare hands, while Xie Lu attacked with the God-Slaying Axe, and was only forced back two steps. Clearly, in terms of equal strength, Zamu Lun was at a disadvantage.\n\nZamu Lun was even more surprised than Nian Bing. Xie Lu had broken through one of his attacks during dinner. However, that was in a restaurant, and Zamu Lun had only used a small amount of fighting spirit, so he hadn't paid too much attention. But this time was different. The wind blade he had just unleashed, due to Nian Bing's possession of the Heavenly Eye acupoint, used almost eighty percent of his fighting spirit and was intended to be a sure hit. He never expected that not only would he fail to kill Nian Bing, but he would be repelled by Xie Lu, who had remained silent. Facing an enemy with a Heavenly Eye acupoint and an enemy whose strength was not inferior to his own, he couldn't help but develop thoughts of retreat. With the selfishness of a god, preserving one's own life was always the most important thing in any situation.",

    "content": "With a slight smile, a faint divine light flickered in Nian Bing's eyes. He watched as Zhamulin's doubtful gaze flickered, and he moved. He pushed off the ground with his right foot, retreating as his body floated backward. At the same time, he transmitted a message to Xilou: \"Brother, this guy is very strong, and we are too close to Duotian City. It's not good to waste too much time. Let's join forces and finish him.\"\n\nNian Bing never had any concept of chivalry. With Zhamulin's strength, if Xilou were to kill him alone, Xilou would undoubtedly have to pay a considerable price. With Nian Bing's presence, killing Zhamulin would be much easier.\n\nXilou naturally understood Nian Bing's meaning. His heart warmed, and with a shake of his shoulders, his body suddenly changed. A yellow light shot out, heading straight for Nian Bing, while Xilou unflinchingly met the nine beams of battle qi that Zhamulin continuously unleashed.\n\nSeeing Xilou's body become shattered amidst the nine beams of battle qi, Zhamulin was overjoyed. Although he was puzzled as to why this once powerful warrior had suddenly become so vulnerable, he felt that dealing with Nian Bing would be much easier now that this formidable enemy was out of the way.\n\nJust as Zhamulin was about to continue his attack, a black light streaked across the sky. Vast battle qi condensed into a sharp blade, heading straight for his head. Zhamulin didn't dare to be careless. His hands flashed with blue light, and two long sabers appeared simultaneously. He crossed them in front of him, blocking upward, and shouted, \"Open.\"\n\n*Boom*—The energy explosion resulting from the clash of two thirteenth-tier experts was truly terrifying. Xilou, who had reappeared and reverted to his dwarf form, tumbled three times in the air before landing in the distance. Centered on Zhamulin's body, the ground within a fifty-zhang radius sank by a zhang. Under the roving battle qi, even the dust was shredded and scattered.\n\nZhamulin spat out a small mouthful of blood. Besides anger, his fear had also greatly increased. Because Xilou had used the fake body created by Nian Bing to distract Zhamulin, and then attacked from above with the God-Slaying Axe, Zhamulin had already suffered a slight disadvantage. For experts of the same level, victory or defeat often hung by a thread.\n\nThe two blue-flashing long sabers in Zhamulin's hands were clearly no ordinary items. Both sabers were identical, four feet long, with narrow blades. The wind element was extremely concentrated. Unfortunately, a chip had appeared on both sabers, clearly from the strike of the God-Slaying Axe. These two sabers had always been Zhamulin's treasures, and the fact that they were damaged by Xilou caused him great pain.\n\nXilou landed more than fifty feet away, gazing coldly at Zhamulin. The black battle qi surrounding his body constantly fluctuated, like hellish black flames. The short hair on his head stood on end. Although his stature was short, his muscles were abnormally developed. The black metal of his Dwarf God Armor had no luster but was perfectly integrated with his entire aura.\n\n\"Dwarf?\" Zhamulin's voice became much more serious. \"You dwarfs dare to run out of the Divine Continent? Humph, we will surely exterminate your entire clan. This time, even Lord Kao cannot help you.\"\n\nUpon hearing the word \"exterminate,\" Xilou was instantly filled with rage. He let out a fierce roar, leaped high into the air, and gripped the Dwarf God Axe with both hands. He brought it down upon Zhamulin as if he were cleaving the heavens and earth.\n\nA strange smile flickered across Zhamulin's face. As a god-level divine being, he had experienced too much to live to this day. Angering an upright dwarf was not difficult for him. His body flickered in place, instantly becoming ethereal and formless like a wisp of blue smoke. Xilou had locked onto his body, but at this moment, the lock suddenly failed. His full-powered attack went straight into the ground, while the wisp of blue smoke instantly escaped his attack range. Zhamulin's somewhat excited voice rang out behind Xilou, \"Blazing Wind Cross Slash.\"\n\nOnce a warrior reached the twelfth tier, although overall energy became the key to victory, skill was what truly highlighted the difference between experts of the same level. Therefore, during combat, few warriors would go all out, always leaving some room for retreat. However, the upright Xilou was now completely enraged by Zhamulin. His all-out attack made it impossible for him to change his forward momentum. At this moment, although he realized he had been tricked, he couldn't retract the battle axe he had already swung. He could only forcefully gather all his battle qi towards his back, preparing to withstand Zhamulin's attack.\n\nIf it were just Xilou and Zhamulin facing off here, then in this mutual exchange, Xilou would have suffered a great disadvantage. Zhamulin's strength was not weaker than his, and even with the Dwarf God's protection, Xilou could not completely filter out the opponent's attack power. Unfortunately, Xilou was not fighting alone. Although he was not calm, not far away, there was Nian Bing, who was calmer than anyone.\n\nA silver silhouette floated gracefully behind Xilou almost at the same time the blue cross slash was launched. Xilou's body, which was charging forward, instantly disappeared. Zhamulin, who was feeling triumphant, was greatly shocked. He naturally did not charge with all his might like Xilou. With almost no hesitation, he turned, forcefully redirecting the cross slash he had unleashed towards his back.\n\n*Boom*—\n\nBlue and black battle qi permeated the air. This time, the destructive power on the ground was even more severe. Within a hundred zhang radius, not a single blade of grass remained. Xilou and Zhamulin both spat out a mouthful of blood. Zhamulin's body was half-submerged in the earth, while Xilou staggered more than ten steps after landing, nearly falling to the ground.\n\nIt turned out that when Xilou was in danger, Nian Bing forcibly implanted a spatial shadow puppet into his body, instantly teleporting him and his attack directly behind Zhamulin. Although the teleportation process caused a certain mental shock to Nian Bing, his peculiar acupoints, which merged the Heavenly Eye and the Imperial Acupoint, made his physical mental power attacks extremely condensed. He merely felt his mind go blank before recovering.\n\nXilou was instantly teleported, while Zhamulin changed the direction of his attack at the last moment. Both of their attacks were weakened invisibly, and neither gained an advantage. After landing, they were both desperately condensing their battle qi. Xilou's eyes had turned red with rage, and he only wanted to attack with all his might. Zhamulin, on the other hand, now wanted to escape immediately.\n\nIf Nian Bing's killing intent was not firm at the beginning, then Zhamulin had now seen Xilou's true divine power and insulted the dwarf race, whom he deeply respected. At this moment, Nian Bing's killing intent had surged to its peak. Seven divine sabers simultaneously appeared around his body, and seven shadow puppets surrounded his body in the center.\n\nNian Bing did not directly attack Zhamulin with instant magic, because he knew very well that with his absolute attack power, it would be difficult to harm Zhamulin, who had already reached the thirteenth tier. Unless he could recover his physical mental power attacks, it would be difficult to harm the opponent with magic, even if he used the twelfth-tier Divine Descent Spell with all his might. Moreover, the divine descent spell had too grand a scale, and it absolutely could not be used so close to Duotian City. Furthermore, he was not afraid of Zhamulin attacking him. With Xilou by his side, unless it was a high-level expert of the Lord God level, it would be impossible to attack him before defeating Xilou. Therefore, he made a special choice.\n\n\"Eternal one, sealed in chaos, balance shattered in nothingness, dwelling in the deepest abyss of the universe, come forth when called, great deity, answer my plea, overlap illusion and reality, intertwine weakness and strength. Change each other's appearance, descend suffering and sorrow upon them. — Intertwined Illusions.\" As the low chant was sung, the Heavenly Eye acupoint on Nian Bing's forehead suddenly lost its seven-colored brilliance and turned into a vast expanse of gray light. A faint gray light drifted out. At this instant, it seemed to cover heaven and earth.\n\nEverything around turned gray. It was a gray without any aura. The sky turned gray, the earth turned gray, and everything between heaven and earth twisted in the grayness.\n\nZhamulin suddenly realized that everything before his eyes was no longer real. A figure appeared in his mind, Nian Bing's figure. Having lived for thousands of years, he was bewildered and didn't know what had happened. Was it magic? No, he had never seen such magic, nor had he ever had such a feeling. He only clearly felt that everything within his body seemed to have changed. He suddenly found that his body was becoming more and more sluggish. Looking down, he was horrified to discover that he had actually turned into a stone.\n\nThe dwarf Xilou before him was growing exponentially. In almost an instant, he had become a giant ten zhang tall. He felt panic. He mobilized the battle qi within his body with all his might, leaped into the air, turned, and ran in the opposite direction. However, he was shocked to find that his body, which had blindly turned into stone, no longer obeyed him and remained in place.\n\nThe ground trembled violently as Xilou stepped forward with one foot. The gray world became even more hazy, and the giant battle axe, as if cleaving the heavens and earth, swung down from above. Gray lines twisted in the air, as if it were unclear where they would land.\n\n\"No!\" Zhamulin roared, but he couldn't hear his own voice. He trembled with fear, never having felt death so close.\n\nNian Bing's calm voice echoed in the depths of his soul, \"You are a stone, you can do nothing.\"\n\nZhamulin still attempted his final resistance, thinking of using his dual sabers to block the battle axe descending from above. However, he could only feel that he was a stone. The next moment, his body became lighter, and he was thrown far away.\n\nXilou felt completely different from Zhamulin. As soon as he recovered, he launched an attack on his opponent. Everything around him remained unchanged. Although the sky was somewhat overcast, everything was so real. As he leaped into the air and gathered all his strength to attack Zhamulin, he was surprised to find his opponent standing there blankly, running towards him abruptly. Although Xilou didn't know why, the axe he had heated for a long time still struck down.\n\nZhamulin raised the blue-flashing dual sabers, but his defense was so weak. Amidst a deafening roar, the dual sabers, deprived of most of their battle qi support, were chopped into four pieces by Xilou. Zhamulin, under the immense impact force, had his defenses broken, his protective battle qi shattered, and was blasted far away. If not for his exceptionally strong innate battle qi, this axe might have split his body in two. But even so, he had suffered severe injuries. His skin was covered in wounds under the effect of Xilou's formidable battle qi, and he coughed up blood repeatedly, clearly having lost all ability to fight.\n\nThe gray space vanished. The seven divine sabers simultaneously entered Nian Bing's body. Nian Bing appeared somewhat tired, but his eyes were filled with excitement. Among the three present, only he knew what had just happened. Intertwined Illusions could be considered a magic, or perhaps not. Because it was not produced by any magic elements, but originated from Nian Bing's mental power. When Nian Bing awoke in the Divine Continent from the Lake of Life, Kao, in order to make him stronger and able to protect himself, had developed several abilities based on his situation and taught them to him.\n\nThe energy base used for Intertwined Illusions was actually the immeasurable energy possessed by the little dragon king of mages, Oscar. It could only be used after fully mastering the seven magic elements, with the seven magic elements as the foundation.\n\nIn that very instant, Nian Bing had drawn in all seven elemental magic powers within a radius of several hundred zhang. Based on his own mental power, using a special chanting method, he activated this special magic, which even he required a spell for. Nian Bing did not know what tier this magic was, but Kao had once told him that the magic's power would increase with the strengthening of his mental power.\n\nThe so-called Intertwined Illusions was to use mental power to invade the opponent's mental power, causing complex illusions to arise in their minds, thus weakening their control over their own abilities. When Nian Bing learned this magic, Kao had told him that it had three major weaknesses. Firstly, it was not a direct attack of mental power, but merely a disturbance. Thus, it could not cause real harm to the opponent, only cause mental confusion for a period of time.\n\nThe advantage of doing this for the user was that they did not have to risk backlash. Even if it failed, their own mental power would not suffer significant damage. The second weakness was that if the opponent's mental power surpassed the user's, or if their willpower was extremely strong, this magic would inevitably incur a ferocious attack from the opponent upon failure, and the user, due to the consumption of mental power, would inevitably be at a disadvantage.",

    "title": "Chapter 192: The Fantasy of the Territory and the Mistake (Part 2)",
    "content": "The final weakness, and the most crucial, is that when the user activates \"Intertwined Chaos,\" due to the high concentration of mental power, they are incapable of launching other attacks or making any body movements while using the ability.\n\nFrom a magical perspective, this is merely an auxiliary spell, not truly suitable for offense.\n\nAlthough there are three weaknesses, the advantages are even more apparent. Once an opponent is trapped in the \"Intertwined Illusion,\" their combat effectiveness will be greatly reduced. In fact, their abilities still exist, but their control will be severely affected by the illusion. In a high-level battle, such an illusion is absolutely fatal.\n\nAfter learning \"Intertwined Illusion,\" Nian Bing understood that it was more fitting to call it a domain rather than a spell—a special auxiliary domain invoked by incantations and mental power.\n\nIf it were just him, he naturally wouldn't use it lightly. But now, with him was a dwarf warrior, Xilou, whose strength was not inferior to Zamron's.\n\nXilou turned around, looking at Nian Bing with surprise as the gray light on his brow gradually receded. A sense of inexplicable dread arose in his heart. Nian Bing's \"Intertwined Illusion\" could target a single opponent or a large area. It naturally wouldn't affect Xilou, but the strangeness of the surrounding space still caused Xilou to feel fear from the depths of his being.\n\nXilou gave Nian Bing a deep look, then glanced at Zamron, who was lying on the ground, bleeding profusely, in the distance. A rank thirteen expert! From being formidable, he had become so vulnerable, all because of some method Nian Bing had used. In his heart, Nian Bing's strength became increasingly mysterious and terrifying.\n\nNian Bing walked to Xilou's side, patted his shoulder, and smiled slightly, saying, \"It seems we expended quite a bit of effort. Brother, are you alright?\"\n\nXilou shook his head. \"Nothing much. Just some minor contusions to my meridians. With my body, I'll recover soon. Just now, during my final attack, I should have been able to kill him. But a phantom suddenly appeared in my mind, and my hand subconsciously softened, sparing his life. Was it you?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"This is a new ability I've learned. I can't let him die yet; I still have questions to ask him.\" As he spoke, he tapped the ground with one foot and floated to Zamron's side. Milky white holy radiance appeared in Nian Bing's palm. The light shone, covering Zamron's body and stopping the bleeding from his wounds.\n\nWith the support of the light-element healing, Zamron immediately felt much better. Seeing Nian Bing's gentle smile, he instinctively moved back slightly. \"What, what do you want to do?\" He still hadn't fully recovered from the \"Intertwined Illusion.\" In his eyes, Nian Bing was like a ferocious devil.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, his eyes flashing with brilliance. \"I don't want to do anything, just ask you a few questions. If you want to live, answer me honestly. Otherwise, you know the consequences.\"\n\nZamron nodded repeatedly, saying fearfully, \"Ask away, I'll tell you everything I know.\" As a selfish deity, a deity who had lived for thousands of years, what they feared most was death.\n\nNian Bing seemed to have anticipated this outcome. His voice softened. He crouched down, looked into Zamron's eyes, and asked, \"Where are the other deities who came to the Yangguang Continent with you? Where are they? What are they doing?\"\n\nZamron shook his head. \"I don't know. When we first arrived on the Yangguang Continent, we were indeed looking for the Seal Bottle of Moerdus. There were more than ten of us. But then we discovered that this continent was simply a paradise! Things we never dared to imagine were incredibly common here. Since we were all god-level experts this time, and no one could restrain the other, after discussing it, we decided to split up and search for the whereabouts of the Seal Bottle of Moerdus. So, I don't know where they are, nor do I know what they are doing now.\"\n\nNian Bing sneered. \"Arranged to search separately after discussion? You are clearly greedy for the various wonders of the Yangguang Continent, and you're just enjoying yourselves everywhere, right? Afterward, you went to the Langmu Empire. With your rank thirteen strength, you became the master of Princess Mu Jing. This way, you could use Mu Jing's influence to find the Seal Bottle of Moerdus, and with the support of the royal family, you could do whatever you wanted, just by asking. Am I right? However, I'm curious why you chose the Langmu Empire. The closest to the Divine Continent should be the Bingyue Empire, shouldn't it?\"\n\nZamron looked a bit embarrassed. \"We arrived on this continent through spatial teleportation magic. When we first arrived, we happened to be at the border of the three empires. Later, after everyone dispersed, a few people went to carry out special missions assigned by the main gods, and the rest of us scattered to various places. As for that Princess Mu Jing, she herself is excellent material, possessing the innate domain of nature, and she has the physique of innate spirit wood. If I could obtain her virgin body, it would greatly benefit my cultivation. However, due to her domain, if she is unwilling, it would be easy for me to kill her, but impossible to obtain her body. She promised me that as long as my companions and I could help the Langmu Empire destroy the Huarong Empire, she would give me her body. So, so I...\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and stood up. \"I understand. What a great god! Mu Jing is truly willing to go to such lengths, trading her chastity for her country. I truly admire her. However, your strength is indeed worth her doing so. I presume you came to the Huarong Empire with her this time as her greatest reliance. With your strength, if you acted deliberately, it wouldn't be impossible to destroy the entire city. It's a pity you were tricked. Although the Huarong Empire found an expert of your level, if the mages of the Rong family, led by Prince Rong, a Divine Descent Master who has reached rank twelve, it is still possible to eliminate someone like you. If I'm not mistaken, you haven't truly reached rank thirteen. Moreover, because you cultivate wind element battle qi and wind element magic simultaneously, you are unable to open your own acupoints, hence your strength is not impressive enough. It is indeed not easy to become a god without opening acupoints based solely on strength.\"\n\nNian Bing had wanted to see how divine acupoints were applied, but he hadn't seen the opponent use them in combat, which made him somewhat puzzled. Just now, he had crouched down specifically to scan Zamron carefully with his Heavenly Eye acupoint, which led him to this conclusion.\n\nZamron naturally did not know about Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye acupoint ability. Hearing him accurately describe his situation, his fear intensified. He quickly said, \"I've told you everything I know. Can you let me go now?\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Did I say I would let you go? If I let you go, will you notify your companions and tell them that dwarves have come to this continent?\"\n\n\"No, no, no, I absolutely won't say anything,\" Zamron realized something.\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"The best way to make someone shut up forever is to eliminate their qualification to exist.\"\n\nZamron's eyes widened in shock, and he repeatedly moved backward. \"You, you just promised not to kill me. You can't do this to me. As long as you promise to spare my life, I'm willing to become your subordinate.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and turned to look at Xilou. \"Brother Zamron, do you think I would believe a despicable deity? For you, there will only be one ending. Think carefully about what I said earlier. When did I ever say I would spare you? Brother Xilou, the rest is up to you. I think you've long wanted to vent your anger.\"\n\n\"Be careful,\" Xilou suddenly exclaimed.\n\nNian Bing's body had already moved away from his original position using a spatial jump almost the instant the first word was uttered. In fact, with his Heavenly Eye acupoint's spiritual sense, he didn't need Xilou's warning at all.\n\nA silver light flashed past where he had been standing, disappearing into the sky in an instant.\n\nXilou's dark figure, almost at the same time the silver light disappeared, arrived in front of Zamron. His massive battle axe swung down without hesitation.\n\n\"Ah—\" With a shrill cry, Zamron's entire chest was shattered by the black battle qi, and blood splattered everywhere.\n\nNian Bing and Xilou didn't go back to Dutian City. The commotion during Zamron's elimination had been significant. Given the Huarong Empire's vigilance, they would surely send people to investigate, so the two detoured and re-entered the city from the north gate.\n\nNian Bing looked at Xilou, who had returned to his tall form with the Longevity Blade, and chuckled, \"Brother, you've had an excited look on your face the whole way back. Is killing a deity that important to you?\"\n\nXilou laughed heartily. \"It feels great! You don't know, although we dwarves can survive on the Divine Continent because of Lord Cao's words, we can only live in the Sacred Mountain. Finally, I can kill deities like my ancestors. Don't you think I should be excited? There aren't many god-level experts like this on the Divine Continent. Each one killed weakens their strength.\"\n\nHearing Xilou's words, Nian Bing couldn't help but ponder. That's right! The biggest disadvantage of the Divine Continent is its numbers.\n\nTheir numbers are too few compared to the billions of humans on the Yangguang Continent. If they were to truly contend with the Divine Continent, then he, too, might have some methods.\n\nOf course, this method could only deal with deities below the level of Main Gods.\n\nAt the level of Main Gods, rank fourteen, numbers would no longer be the deciding factor.\n\nDutian City was indeed too large. After entering the city, Nian Bing and Xilou could no longer use their abilities. It took them a full hour of walking just to return to that magic item shop.\n\nAs the magic item shop was just ahead, Xilou couldn't help but smile wryly. \"Why do I feel that walking back is more tiring than that fight just now? Brother, I've lived for so many years, but I probably haven't walked this much in the past hundred years combined as I have today.\"\n\nNian Bing laughed. \"It can't be helped. You need to adapt to integrate into this new society. You'll get used to it later. Don't you think that only in this environment can you have a relaxed and comfortable life?\"\n\nXilou stretched his body somewhat exaggeratedly. \"Yes! I'm already starting to love this continent.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"I think you've fallen for the delicious food, haven't you?\"\n\nXilou blushed. \"What's wrong with that? It's all love, anyway. Let's go, we're here.\" As he spoke, they arrived at the entrance of the magic item shop.\n\nAt this time, a \"Closed for Business\" sign was hanging on the door. Nian Bing pretended not to see it and walked in side-by-side with Xilou.\n\nThe previous shop assistant hurried to greet them. Accompanying him was someone who looked like a shopkeeper. Judging by his aura, Nian Bing determined that this person already had the strength of a martial artist.\n\nFacing his subordinate, Nian Bing naturally exuded an aura of authority. He said calmly, \"Have they all arrived?\"\n\nThe shop assistant nodded. \"They have all arrived. Please follow me.\" Saying this, they bowed to Nian Bing and the two, then led them to the back.\n\nAlthough the shop looked small from the outside, the backyard was exceptionally spacious. Nian Bing could clearly sense at least twenty hidden sentries in this large courtyard, and he couldn't help but praise them internally.\n\nThe shop assistant and the shopkeeper led them to the door of a large room in the main hall. The shopkeeper whispered, \"Sect Leader, the elders are inside.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Alright, you may go.\" Saying this, he raised his hand and pushed the door open.\n\nThis was a living room of about fifty square meters, furnished with great care. As soon as Nian Bing entered, the people in the living room all stood up. Nian Bing's body trembled, and he exclaimed in surprise, \"Grandfather!\"\n\nIn the room, in addition to the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion whom Nian Bing had summoned, there was another person: Prince Rong, who managed the national military of the Huarong Empire, and at the same time, the former Sect Leader of the Blood Lion Sect, the Demon Lion Rong Yan!",

    "title": "Chapter 193: Convincing Nian Bing’s Conscience (Part 1)",
    "content": "All seven Blood Lion Cult Elders respectfully said, \"Greetings, Cult Master,\" except for Prince Rong who remained standing. Although their status did not require them to bow, propriety could not be abandoned.\n\nNian Bing hurriedly and respectfully greeted these seniors, \"Greetings, Elders. Grandfather, why have you also come?\"\n\nPrince Rong's expression was solemn, his face like still water. He glanced at Xi Lu beside him and said in a deep voice, \"I heard you became an envoy for the Ice Moon Empire. Is that true?\" As soon as he received the news of Nian Bing's arrival from Rong Bing and learned that Nian Bing had summoned the seven elders for a meeting, he had rushed over.\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"That's right, I am indeed representing the Ice Moon Empire this time. This Brother Xi Lu is my friend, one of us, there's nothing inconvenient about it.\" As he spoke, Nian Bing walked to the head seat and sat down.\n\nPrince Rong's gaze followed Nian Bing all the way. Seeing him sit down, he said coldly, \"You need to give me an explanation for this matter.\"\n\nNian Bing said casually, joking, \"Grandfather, since you handed over the Blood Lion Cult to me, you should trust my decisions. I am very clear about the Blood Lion Cult's tenets, and I am capable of handling things. You've come at the right time, saving me the trouble of finding you. There are some matters I wish to discuss with you.\"\n\nPrince Rong's expression softened a little. \"Nian Bing, the reason I decided to pass the position of Cult Master to you was because I valued your broad perspective and your abilities. I believe that under your control, the Blood Lion Cult will develop even better. However, your representing the Ice Moon Empire this time, and the presence of the Ice Snow Goddess's priestess accompanying you, forces me to doubt your motives. You should understand how important the Four Nations Consensus Conference is to our Hua Rong Empire. Also, you've been missing for over a year. Don't forget, you are the head of a cult. With such irresponsibility, how can I feel at ease?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Don't worry, Grandfather. I will give you an explanation now. First, I want to ask you a question. While the Four Nations Consensus Conference is important to the Hua Rong Empire, is it equally important to our Rong family?\"\n\nPrince Rong was startled. The expressions of the seven elders on the side shifted, as if they had grasped the main point Nian Bing was making. Prince Rong frowned, \"Of course, it is important to our Rong family. The Hua Rong Empire is our foundation. If the Hua Rong Empire prospers, the Rong family will naturally prosper along with it.\"\n\nNian Bing said indifferently, \"If it were that simple, there would be no need for the existence of the Blood Lion Cult. Grandfather, I just want to tell you... the Blood Lion Cult exists for the Rong family, but not for the Hua Rong Empire. If it weren't for my absence from the cult, just considering the matter of the Qilu Empire alone. I would never have allowed the cult's strength to support your actions.\"\n\nPrince Rong looked into Nian Bing's pure azure eyes and already understood some of what he meant. He said in a deep voice, \"Continue speaking.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Our Blood Lion Cult, although it is the largest underground force on the Yangguang Continent, has always been mysterious, and few people even know of our existence. However, in the battle against the Qilu Empire, our cult suffered considerable losses, didn't it? Anyone with intention can see that the Hua Rong Empire utilized a power that did not belong to it. Emperor Hua Tian is your brother, but have you considered that now that he is the emperor, he is inevitably very familiar with the situation within the army? It's likely that some of our cult's secrets have already been exposed. Moreover, the losses incurred by our cult in this campaign against the Qilu Empire are probably not insignificant. Is this what you hoped to see? Sacrificing the lives of our cult brothers for the Hua Rong Empire? You have always been a subject. Perhaps you are not afraid of the phrase 'merit eclipsing the sovereign,' but since you have entrusted me with the task of protecting the Rong family, I cannot help but think more. Therefore, I have decided that from now on, without my command, the Blood Lion Cult will no longer exert any effort for the Hua Rong Empire.\"\n\nUpon hearing Nian Bing's words, all seven elders nodded slightly. The First Elder even showed approval. When Prince Rong had decided that the Blood Lion Cult would assist the Hua Rong Empire in attacking the Qilu Empire, he had already raised an objection. However, because Nian Bing was absent and the other elders supported Prince Rong, the action had ultimately proceeded. Although Nian Bing had not participated in that campaign, his analysis now was exceptionally accurate, and every judgment seemed as if he had witnessed it personally.\n\nPrince Rong said coldly, \"My greatest wish in this life is for the mages to unify the continent. As long as I live, I will strive in this direction.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, stood up, and said, \"Grandfather, please calm down for a moment. That's right, I can understand your ultimate wish as a commander, but I repeat, your efforts are all for the Hua Rong Empire, not for our Rong family. Secondly, unifying the continent does not necessarily require conquest. With your methods of unification, only the Hua Rong Empire will ultimately benefit. However, if we unify using my methods, our Rong family will benefit. You should be very clear about the regime change operation during the Ice Moon Empire's succession, shouldn't you? Although I am not the monarch of the Ice Moon Empire, I dare say that with just one command from me, the Ice Moon Empire will truly undergo a regime change, becoming the best base for our Rong family. Can your years of continuous warfare achieve this? I have only one ultimate goal: to control every country on the continent with the power of our Blood Lion Cult, becoming the true King of the Continent. I believe such an outcome is far more effective than your years of continuous warfare.\"\n\n\"I agree with the Cult Master's statement.\" The First Elder stepped forward and stood behind Nian Bing. Prince Rong was his son; how could he not understand his son's thoughts?\n\nPrince Rong watched as his father voluntarily stood behind his grandson, a trace of loss appearing in his eyes. The other elders also came to stand behind Nian Bing one after another, proving with their actions who they supported. Although Nian Bing had disappeared for over a year, the regime change operation in the Ice Moon Empire, which was almost impossible, had been completed under his sole orchestration, bringing immense benefits to the Blood Lion Cult. It was precisely this operation that established Nian Bing's extremely high prestige within the cult, truly gaining the affirmation of the Blood Lion Cult's seven elders. Nian Bing had proven with his actions that his ideas were feasible.\n\nLooking at the seven elders and then at Nian Bing, Prince Rong said somewhat bitterly, \"Perhaps I am truly old now.\"\n\nThe First Elder, Zhao, said impatiently, \"You scoundrel, dare to act old in front of me? You're not old, you're muddle-headed.\"\n\nPrince Rong then remembered that the elders present were all his elders and felt somewhat embarrassed. \"Father, I didn't mean it that way. Since you all have decided to support Nian Bing, I have nothing more to say. Actually, I also understand that what Nian Bing says makes a lot of sense. However, I still wish to unify the entire continent with my own strength, through iron and blood.\"\n\nNian Bing stood up, walked to Prince Rong's side, and helped him sit down. \"Grandfather, you don't need to be discouraged. I've made this decision after considering the overall situation. As the strongest commander on the continent, I understand your aspirations. However, our Yangguang Continent cannot afford any more wars now, because foreign enemies could appear at any moment. Against these powerful enemies, only through our complete and united effort, a union without borders, can we possibly resist. Although I don't know when this possibility I'm talking about might occur, or if it might never occur, we must be prepared! Otherwise, the Yangguang Continent will face immense changes, immense disasters.\"\n\nLooking at the astonished gazes of Prince Rong and the seven elders, Nian Bing continued, \"You must all be wondering where I've been for the past year or so, to the point where even the Blood Lion Cult's intelligence network couldn't find me. This is because I was not on the Yangguang Continent at all. Ordinary people don't know of that place's existence, but I believe you must know it – that is the so-called Continent of the Gods where the gods gather. It was precisely because I went there that I disappeared for over a year.\"\n\n\"What? You went to the Continent of the Gods?\" Prince Rong exclaimed. For the people of the Yangguang Continent, the Continent of the Gods was a very mysterious existence, a place where the legendary gods resided.\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"That's right, I went to the Continent of the Gods. I stayed there for a full year and a half. During this year and a half, I finally understood what those so-called gods are. The so-called gods are nothing more than people. They also have long histories. Moreover, these gods are not as sacred as you imagine; in fact, they are all selfish humans. Undeniably, these god-like beings possess immense power, and there are also sealing restrictions preventing them from easily coming to our continent. However, I can confirm that once they appear, they will bring disaster to the Yangguang Continent. The enemies I spoke of possibly appearing are them. Although the number of these god-like beings is not large, even the weakest among them has a strength close to a Martial Saint. The Continent of the Gods is also not as wonderful as the legends claim. Compared to it, the Yangguang Continent is practically paradise. If a group of powerful god-like beings descends from hell to paradise, what will they do?\" Nian Bing then briefly recounted his experiences on the Continent of the Gods, omitting the details about Meodas's Seal Bottle and the Four True Gods, and not mentioning why he went there. \"It is precisely because of such a threat that it is imperative for us to develop rapidly in peace, using our numerical advantage to contend with the Continent of the Gods. Even if they do not come, we must be prepared. Otherwise, the Yangguang Continent will face immense changes, immense disasters.\"\n\nLooking at the disbelieving expressions of Prince Rong and the seven elders, Nian Bing nodded to Xi Lu. Yellow light surged, and the disguise of the Longevity Blade was instantly removed, revealing Xi Lu's true appearance.\n\n\"The legendary dwarves. I don't know if Grandfather and the seven elders have heard of them. But I can tell you that the strength of this Brother Xi Lu has surpassed that of a Divine Master, reaching the level of a near thirteenth-rank expert, which is equivalent to a god-level expert on the Continent of the Gods. I believe this can already prove my words.\"\n\nSilence. Everyone in the conference room fell silent. Nian Bing sat back in his seat. He was not in a hurry; he knew that everything he said was difficult for Prince Rong and the others to comprehend, and they needed time to think. He also believed that with Grandfather Prince Rong's wisdom, it would not be difficult for him to understand his intentions.\n\nAfter a long while, the First Elder was the first to speak, \"Nian Bing, then what do you want to do now? I want to hear your thoughts.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"What I want to do is very simple: maintain the current situation on the continent. The Hua Rong Empire and the other three empires will face each other north and south, developing simultaneously. The Four Nations Peace Talks must naturally be completed. At the same time, the Oran, Ice Moon, and Langmu Empires will form an alliance. This way, the Hua Rong Empire will have no reason to send troops against the three countries. Only in this way can peace be restored to the continent.\" He recounted the conversation he had with Luo Rou and Mu Jing in the porridge shop earlier and clarified his views. Nian Bing knew that although the Four Nations Consensus Conference had not yet begun, as long as his grandfather agreed to his plan, the overall situation would be settled, and the meeting to be held the day after tomorrow would not have any unexpected changes. The Hua Rong Empire's objective would be achieved, and Nian Bing's objective would also be achieved.\n\nPrince Rong said, \"The affairs of the Hua Rong Empire are not something I can decide alone, Nian Bing. Although I approve of your plan, are you confident in convincing my old friend? This meeting is presided over by Su Yue. Convincing him is not an easy task. In terms of wisdom, I have never seen anyone more brilliant than him.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"I deal with intelligent people. I believe Grandpa Su will also understand the current situation. Moreover, the Hua Rong Empire also needs peace now. As for the future, as long as the other three empires develop, it will not be easy for the Hua Rong Empire to launch an attack. Before coming here, I had thought very clearly. In the coming period, what the Blood Lion Cult needs to do is infiltrate the Langmu Empire and the Oran Empire. When these two empires become like the Ice Moon Empire, our Rong family will be prosperous and prosperous forever.\"\n\nPrince Rong nodded. \"Alright, I agree with your approach. In fact, the Blood Lion Cult will only obey your command. As long as the three countries agree to the peace talks, then this meeting will naturally be much easier.\"\n\nNian Bing stood up. \"Grandfather, then I will take my leave. The future of the Rong family still relies on you. After the peace talks conclude the day after tomorrow, I will leave here immediately. I will notify you of any news through the Blood Lion Cult. Strengthen training, enhance our own controllable strength, and remain unchanged to cope with all changes – this is the best strategy. Seven Elders, I'm leaving now.\"\n\nAmidst the respectful send-off from the seven elders, Nian Bing, with Xi Lu, left the secret stronghold of the Blood Lion Cult. Although the conversation was brief, it had achieved the desired effect, which was sufficient.",

    "title": "Chapter 193: Convinced Nian Bing’s Conscience (Part 2)",
    "content": "He now had one more goal, and once he convinced this final target, the Four Nations Public Opinion Conference would be completely under his control.\n\nWhen Nian Bing and Xi Lu returned to the State Guesthouse, the sky had gradually darkened, entering the evening hours. Before he even reached his room door, he heard laughter from next door.\n\nXi Lu nudged Nian Bing, saying, \"Go on, spend time with your wives. I'll go back and cultivate for a bit to heal my injuries.\" With that, he opened his door and entered his room.\n\nNian Bing tiptoed to the next room and happened to hear them talking. Through the sensation from his Heavenly Eye acupoint, he clearly perceived that not only were the three women, Long Ling, Luo Rou, and Yu Ruyan, in the room, but the three daughters of the Phoenix were also present.\n\nHe heard Long Ling say, \"Why hasn't Nian Bing returned after being gone for so long?\"\n\nFeng Nu giggled, \"Sister Ling'er, you can't be like this. We've only been apart for a short while! You miss him already. Let's unite; otherwise, won't he always bully us?\"\n\nYu Ruyan asked, \"Feng Nu, Chen Chen, Ling'er, have you all decided to marry Nian Bing?\" The moment she spoke, a brief silence fell in the room. Nian Bing, standing outside, perked up his ears, wanting to hear how the three women would answer.\n\nThe first to speak was Lan Chen. She said somewhat shyly, \"Mom, you already know about us. If I don't marry him, who else can I marry? My sisters and Ling'er knew him even before I did, and they probably can't leave Nian Bing either. Back then, Nian Bing risked his life to save me and also helped my sisters and Ling'er open their Heavenly Eye acupoints. From that drop of Angel's Tear, we understood his heart. Actually, every woman has jealousy, and everyone wishes to possess their beloved exclusively. However, we don't want Nian Bing to be troubled for our sake. My sister, Ling'er, and I have already discussed it. Since he deeply loves us, and we can't let him go, then we can only be together, forever together. I think we will get along very well.\"\n\nFeng Nu and Long Ling exchanged glances and nodded simultaneously. Yu Ruyan sighed helplessly, \"This brat got off too easily. Then when do you plan to formalize your relationships with him?\"\n\nFeng Nu replied, \"Nian Bing's greatest wish is to rescue his parents. We'll talk about it after we welcome Uncle's parents. Mom, we believe Nian Bing won't mistreat us.\"\n\nLong Ling added, \"Yes! Auntie. Although Nian Bing is sometimes mysterious, he is truly good to us. To marry a man who is willing to give his life for us, what more could we be dissatisfied with? Auntie, please don't worry. We are three sisters, you know. If he dares to bully us, then in the future, in the future, we will...\"\n\nStanding outside the door, Nian Bing's eyes were a little moist. Since his return, he had been busy with the continent's situation and had never had a chance to have a heart-to-heart talk with the three women. Hearing them understand him so well filled his heart with warmth. Just then, Nian Bing suddenly felt a cold aura from behind him. He instinctively turned around and saw the Ice Goddess Priestess with an icy expression.\n\nHe was secretly startled, thinking, \"How could I have forgotten her? She probably heard everything I did. It's likely that Chen Chen's identity can no longer be concealed this time.\"\n\nThe Ice Goddess Priestess said coldly, \"The person who used Divine Descent Technique on the mountains outside Ice Moon City last time, was that you?\"\n\nNian Bing felt there was no need to hide anymore and nodded, saying, \"That's right, it was me.\"\n\nThe voices from outside immediately alerted the women in the room. With flashes of figures, Yu Ruyan, the three mothers, Long Ling, and Luo Rou successively came out. Lan Chen, having returned the Morning Dew Blade to Nian Bing, was not disguised. Upon suddenly seeing her master, she immediately lowered her head, unable to speak.\n\nThe Ice Goddess Priestess looked at Bing Yun, then at Nian Bing, her cold gaze becoming exceptionally complex. She nodded and said, \"Good, very good! I never expected that the two most accomplished disciples of my life would end up like this. Bing Ling, Bing Yun, both eventually left me. Good, good, good. Nian Bing, with your strength and wisdom, you can completely resolve matters here on your own. I am no longer needed here. In a hundred days, I will wait for you at the Ice God Tower to decide the fate of your parents. Bing Yun, you will accompany him to see me then. If you fail to see me, you know the consequences.\" Without another second of delay, she turned and walked towards her room.\n\n\"Master,\" Lan Chen cried out mournfully and knelt on the ground. The Ice Goddess Priestess's desolate retreating figure deeply shook her heart. How could the kindness of her upbringing for so many years be forgotten?\n\nThe Ice Goddess Priestess stopped. \"Don't call me Master. You have already forgotten my instructions. You have a mother now, a man, and you no longer need me, your master.\"\n\n\"No, it's not like that. Master, you...\" Tears streamed down Bing Yun's face. The Ice Goddess Priestess didn't stop any longer and returned to her room. Even with Nian Bing's intelligence, he couldn't fathom what the Ice Goddess Priestess was thinking now, but he was certain that she wouldn't stay here. Nian Bing was confident that with their combined strength and Xi Lu, they could kill her. However, he had promised Bing Yun not to kill the Ice Goddess Priestess. What should he do now? In a hundred days, it would likely be the final decisive battle.\n\nThe Ice Goddess Priestess left with her subordinates. After staying in Dutian City for less than a day, she chose to depart. Lan Chen's grief reminded Nian Bing of his own feelings when Cha Ji passed away. He knew Lan Chen needed his comfort the most.\n\nIn the room, Nian Bing held Lan Chen in his arms. Feng Nu and Long Ling sat on his bed. None of the four spoke, only Lan Chen's soft sobs.\n\nHolding Lan Chen's delicate body, Nian Bing softly comforted her, \"Stop crying, this is the inevitable outcome.\"\n\nLan Chen looked at him with tear-filled eyes and choked out, \"Master doesn't want me anymore. Although Master has always been very strict with me, I know she actually doted on me very much. The incident with Senior Sister Bing Ling back then had deeply wounded her heart, and this time, I, I also... I've never seen such despair in Master's eyes. Nian Bing, I want to go after Master.\"\n\nNian Bing held her tighter and said firmly, \"No, I won't let you go. You are my wife, and I never want to see what happened to my parents happen to us again. In a hundred days, when the final confrontation with the magician concludes, I will let her go. Since I promised you, I definitely won't kill her.\" The hatred for the Ice Goddess Priestess and his love for Lan Chen made his heart very conflicted.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I've put you in a difficult position. Perhaps, we shouldn't have been together in the first place. I know you love my sisters, you love Long Ling, and what happened between us was just a coincidence. Nian Bing, I don't blame you; it was my fault. You've also paid so much for me, let me go.\" Lan Chen spoke words that hurt herself against her will.\n\nNian Bing kissed her forehead. \"Silly girl, what nonsense are you talking about? Don't you understand my love for you yet? I won't let you go, never.\" As he spoke, he wiped the tears from Lan Chen's face with his sleeve. \"I'll stay here with you. I don't want to wake up tomorrow morning and suddenly find one of my wives missing.\"\n\nFeng Nu got up and sat on Lan Chen's other side, glaring at Nian Bing, \"We're not your wives yet.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, glanced at the dazed Lan Chen, and said, \"Isn't that simple? I have a great suggestion. Why don't we push your three beds together, and we can all sleep together. Then you'll all truly become my wives.\"\n\nFeng Nu's face turned bright red. \"You're so annoying, what are you talking about? Don't even think about it.\" Lan Chen also looked up, surprised, at Nian Bing. A blush appeared on her previously sad face, clearly recalling the scene in the cave.\n\nNian Bing chuckled and quickly climbed onto the bed, kicking off his shoes and lying down on Lan Chen's bed. He stretched out comfortably, then put his arm around Feng Nu's slender waist. \"I don't care, I'm not leaving today anyway. I'll stay here and sleep with you. Even Mom agrees to you being with me, so what's there to be shy about?\" His teasing voice immediately lightened the atmosphere in the room. Feng Nu, whom he held, glanced at her sister, then at Long Ling, and her shyness intensified. She wanted to break free from Nian Bing's grasp, but Nian Bing held on tightly, refusing to let go.\n\nLong Ling giggled, quickly lay down on her own bed, turned her back to Nian Bing and the other two, and said, \"It has nothing to do with me. I can't see anything, I can't hear anything.\"\n\nNian Bing rolled over and sat up, squeezing between Feng Nu and Lan Chen. He held one in each arm and said, \"No one is escaping today. I want to make you all my true wives. Let's all sleep together, haha.\"\n\nFeng Nu and Lan Chen simultaneously punched Nian Bing's shoulder, chiding, \"Who wants to sleep together with you?\"\n\nNian Bing exaggeratedly cried out in pain, \"Murdering your own husband!\" He then fell backward, closing his eyes, and immediately stopped breathing.\n\nFeng Nu chuckled. Neither she nor Lan Chen had put any real strength into their punches. She reached out and pinched Nian Bing's thigh hard, saying, \"You're annoying, stop playing dead.\"\n\n\"Wow, I'm alive again.\" Nian Bing suddenly sat up. Feng Nu happened to turn and look at him. He sat up extremely quickly, and before Feng Nu could react, her lips were met with his, a hot kiss.\n\nFeng Nu's body trembled, and the hand that was pinching Nian Bing immediately went limp. Nian Bing quickly withdrew, turned, and kissed Bing Yun's lips as well. This was the first intimate moment they had shared since his return from the Divine Continent.\n\nFeng Nu was about to scold him when Nian Bing's playful expression suddenly vanished. He held them tightly and said, \"Promise me, don't leave me. You are already the most important part of my life. If I lose you, then life has no meaning for me.\"\n\nLooking at the seriousness in Nian Bing's eyes, Feng Nu proactively wrapped her arm around him and leaned her shoulder against him, whispering, \"We won't. None of us will leave you.\"\n\nLan Chen knew that Nian Bing's words were mostly directed at her. She also knew that Nian Bing was teasing her and her sister just to cheer her up. Deep affection surged within her, and she also leaned her shoulder against him. \"Nian Bing, I'm sorry for making you worry. What needs to be faced must be faced. Perhaps, I'm overthinking things.\"\n\nWith beautiful women in his embrace, Nian Bing's heart stirred. He looked at each of them deeply and said sternly, \"Since that's the case, then let's all sleep together tonight.\"\n\n\"Annoying.\" \"Ah—\" Nian Bing cried out in pain and jumped up from the bed. Even with his tough physique, being pinched so hard in such a sensitive area as the inner thigh would be excruciating. A few breaths later, the pitiable man was pushed out of the room by the three women. The door slammed shut, leaving him outside with a helpless expression, looking at the door and sighing.\n\nLeaning against the wall in the corridor, a faint smile appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. \"If we could truly all sleep together, what a wonderful thing that would be!\"\n\nHis mental energy emanated from his Heavenly Eye acupoint. A strange light flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. His vast mental perception had already covered the entire inn. Soon, he found his target. Straightening up, he headed towards his target. The place he needed to go was not far from Feng Nu's room. Nian Bing quickly arrived outside the room and stopped, raising his hand to knock lightly on the door a few times, waiting quietly.\n\n\"Who?\" Mu Jing's voice came from the room. From her voice, Nian Bing could tell that the princess of the Langmu Empire seemed somewhat tired.\n\n\"It's me, Nian Bing,\" he replied calmly.\n\nFootsteps sounded from inside the room, and the door opened. Mu Jing, dressed in a green dress, appeared before Nian Bing. She clearly hadn't expected Nian Bing to come looking for her and had a look of surprise in her eyes.\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"What? Aren't you going to invite me in for a sit?\" Princess Mu Jing.\"\n\n\"Oh, please come in.\" Mu Jing moved aside, making space and inviting Nian Bing into her room. The inn was the same, and the room layouts were naturally not significantly different. Nian Bing directly walked to the sofa in the outer living room and sat down. Mu Jing poured him a cup of water before sitting on the sofa opposite him.\n\n\"Princess Mu Jing, you didn't expect me to come, did you?\" Nian Bing said unhurriedly after taking a sip of water.\n\nMu Jing replied, \"I truly didn't expect you to come. Please don't call me 'Princess' anymore; just call me by my name. Is there something you need, Brother Nian?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Princess, there's no need to be so formal. Since you've asked me to call you by your name, you should call me by mine too. I can see that you haven't been resting well these past few days.\"",

    "content": "Mu Jing sighed and said, \"At a time of national crisis, how can those in high positions not worry? Nian Bing, just say whatever you have to say.\"\n\nNian Bing asked, \"Is Your Highness blaming me for not agreeing to join forces with the Langmu Empire to attack the Huarong Empire?\"\n\nMu Jing glanced at Nian Bing and replied, \"This is your decision representing the Bingyue Empire, but I hope you will consider it carefully. It's not about blame, I just hope you can think long-term. Of course, if your visit is not truly for the benefit of the Bingyue Empire, then anything more I say will be useless.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"If I weren't here for the benefit of the Bingyue Empire, then why would the King of the Bingyue Empire trust me so much? Perhaps we cannot become friends, but I think we can certainly become partners who utilize each other. You wouldn't doubt that, would you, Mu Jing?\"\n\nMu Jing said with some sarcasm, \"You are very frank. Partners who utilize each other? Would true partners utilize each other? Stop beating around the bush. It's getting late, and we are alone in this room, man and woman. Aren't you afraid your confidantes will be jealous?\"\n\nNian Bing replied, \"They are my confidantes, and they naturally trust me. Mu Jing, why is your Langmu Empire so eager to join forces with the Aolan and Bingyue Empires to declare war on the Huarong Empire? I think it can't be just because of that sneak attack by the Huarong Empire back then.\"\n\nMu Jing replied, \"Of course not. The Langmu Empire is vast and rich in resources, and we could afford the losses from that incident. However, as you know, the Huarong Empire annihilated the Qilu Empire. What does that represent? They have wolfish ambitions and will not stop there. Once they recover, the next target will be us or the Aolan Empire. In this situation, we will be defeated separately and benefit together. Only by attacking the Huarong Empire when they are weakest can we possibly win in one battle. Otherwise, once the Huarong Empire integrates the forces of the Qilu Empire, who will be their opponent? The continent will inevitably become the sole possession of the Huarong Empire. It's not that we want war, but we are forced to fight.\"\n\n\"Good. If Your Highness thinks so, then we have common ground. Your Highness worries about the future expansion of the Huarong Empire. Then, I would like to ask, if our three countries join forces to attack the Huarong Empire now, what are our chances of victory? The Huarong Empire attacked the Qilu Empire with strategic brilliance, paying only the minimum cost. Although they now need a certain amount of troops to control the surrendered soldiers, their main forces have not suffered significant losses. If you want to defeat the Huarong Empire, you should at least have a way to deal with the Flame Dragon Knight and Flame Lion Knight legions. Do you have it? You don't. Although I am not familiar with the situation in the Langmu Empire, the Huarong Empire's knight legion that uses Earth Dragons as mounts is not something you can contend with. If a real war breaks out, the most likely outcome will be mutual destruction, and the three-country alliance will gain nothing, only losing troops and suffering casualties. Moreover, although the three countries are allied, can you guarantee absolute trust between them? Even if there is mutual destruction, due to the lack of unified command, the recovery speed of the three countries will absolutely not be comparable to that of the Huarong Empire, and in the end, the fate will still be defeat.\"\n\nMu Jing snorted and said, \"How do you know I don't have a way to deal with the Flame Dragon Knight legion? Indeed, the main forces of the Huarong Empire are still there, but with the combined strength of our three countries, plus the divine descent spell of your country's Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, we still have some chance. Does the Huarong Empire have any experts who can contend with the divine descent spell?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, and his peculiar gaze made Mu Jing feel uneasy. \"Your Highness, you are not telling the truth. I don't believe you cannot discern that Prince Rong has the strength of a Divine Master. I think your confidence mainly comes from your two helpers from the Divine Continent.\"\n\nMu Jing was greatly shocked and looked at Nian Bing in horror. Although her will was firm, she could not hide her inner panic when Nian Bing suddenly revealed her true reliance.\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"Your Highness, there's no need to overthink. I recognized Zhamulun's origin as soon as I met him. But have you ever thought that if your Langmu Empire can find such helpers, couldn't the Huarong Empire also find them? True warfare is a battle of national strength. The Huarong Empire's army has fought many battles in recent years, far surpassing the other three countries. Therefore, what I said about mutual destruction is just the best-case scenario. More likely, the Huarong Empire will achieve a bitter victory. By then, your Langmu Empire will truly have no chance. I believe this is not what Your Highness wants to see. Considering the current strength of the three countries, your country and my Bingyue Empire can both fight. However, the Aolan Empire has been weak for a long time. Although there have been some changes in the past two years, only its national strength has increased, not its military strength. Even if we all agree to send troops with you, the final outcome will not be as I predicted. Your Highness is intelligent, and I don't think I need to say more.\"\n\nMu Jing looked at Nian Bing deeply and said, \"What if we don't fight? Will the Huarong Empire let us go? Once they recover their strength, even though your Bingyue Empire is far away, after our Langmu Empire is destroyed, you probably won't escape the same fate. I would like to hear what you think. From your appearance, you seem quite confident.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"That's right. After the Huarong Empire annexed the Qilu Empire, its national strength has indeed increased greatly. However, it's not necessarily true that we three countries don't have an advantage. In terms of total area, our three countries are still slightly larger than the Huarong Empire, especially your country, which is the granary of the entire Yangguang Continent. The three countries can mutually support each other. If our Bingyue Empire and your Langmu Empire work together to help the Aolan Empire develop, and when our three countries are all very strong and form a solid alliance, even if the Huarong Empire becomes stronger, it will not dare to offend us lightly. The situation of confrontation between north and south is irreversible. What is needed now is not war, but development. The prerequisite for development is peace. Therefore, on behalf of the Bingyue Empire, I am willing to form an alliance with your country, but this peace talk must succeed.\"\n\nMu Jing took a deep breath and said, \"Are you really that confident? Nian Bing, why should I believe you? You are clearly from the Rong family. How can I know this isn't an alarmist statement?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"I told you, I left the Rong family when I was very young. If even you can see this, how could the current King of the Bingyue Empire not know? Since he trusts me and sent me as an envoy of the Bingyue Empire to participate in this peace talk, why can't you believe me? Would you rather believe Zhamulun, who plotted to take your virginity?\"\n\n\"You—\" Mu Jing suddenly stood up, looking at Nian Bing with surprise and uncertainty. The handsome young man before her felt so terrifying, as if he could see through any secret in her heart. Mu Jing's heart was beating violently, and a hint of blush appeared on her beautiful face. She said resentfully, \"Did Zhamulun tell you this? Have you known him for a long time?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Do you want to ask me when Zhamulun betrayed you? Actually, you shouldn't ask that, because you've misunderstood. I did meet Zhamulun for the first time today, and I did learn all this from him. Unfortunately, I am not his friend. I disdain to associate with selfish and despicable divine beings, no matter how powerful they are. Your esteemed teacher Zhamulun has long since lost his most precious life. Oh, no, it should be a despicable and selfish life. Perhaps his soul has gone to hell.\"\n\n\"What did you say? You killed him? No, that's impossible. I absolutely don't believe it.\" Mu Jing said firmly, looking at Nian Bing. She was very clear about Zhamulun's strength. If it weren't for his God-level strength, why would she have agreed to have him support her in exchange for her virginity? She had witnessed Nian Bing's magic. Although Nian Bing was a powerful figure among the younger generation, in her opinion, Nian Bing could not compare to Zhamulun from the Divine Continent.\n\nNian Bing sighed and said, \"Your Highness, you are too stubborn. Would you rather believe Zhamulun, who agreed to support you in exchange for your virginity, than believe me? Yes, Zhamulun is indeed very strong, but I can still kill him. The so-called gods from the Divine Continent are merely self-righteous humans. Since they are still humans, why can't they be killed?\"\n\nMu Jing's delicate body swayed, and she sat back down. The color drained from her face, and she muttered with a trembling voice, \"No, this is not true. Zhamulun is dead. How could he possibly die?\" The reason she dared to openly win over the Aolan Empire this time without worrying about possible surveillance by the Huarong Empire was because of Zhamulun's presence. She had great confidence in Zhamulun's strength. Although she deeply disliked that divine being deep down, she had to admit that Zhamulun possessed formidable strength. In her opinion, even the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess might not be Zhamulun's opponent. Even if she encountered any danger in the Huarong Empire, with Zhamulun's protection, she could return to her country safely. However, Nian Bing told her that Zhamulun had been killed by him. Mu Jing felt a sense of relief deep in her heart, as how could she truly be willing to give her body to someone she disliked? However, Zhamulun's death also plunged her into crisis. Without the support of that powerful expert, she no longer knew what to do. Facing Nian Bing or the Huarong Empire, she realized she no longer had the right to speak. Although she was not familiar with Nian Bing and even hated this fellow who repeatedly disrupted her plans, she knew that Nian Bing was not someone who would casually fabricate lies. Moreover, if this were fabricated by him, it would be too ridiculous and easily exposed. Mu Jing's mind was in complete chaos at this moment; she didn't know how to face all this. Zhamulun was dead, but his companion was still in the Langmu Empire. If she were to bring the news of Zhamulun's death back, the Langmu Empire's royal palace would likely face assassination attempts from a God-level expert at any time. That was a situation she absolutely did not want to see!\n\nSeeing Mu Jing's surprised and uncertain expression, Nian Bing smiled and said, \"Your Highness is worried? Actually, you don't need to be. I hope you can calm down and carefully consider what I've said. Everything I've done is simply to prevent war. I have no enmity with the Langmu Empire, so why would I harm you? If you are willing, after our three countries form an alliance, the Bingyue Empire will work with your Langmu Empire to support the Aolan Empire's development. At that time, when our three countries unite to jointly resist the Huarong Empire. If you are worried about the other divine being staying in your Langmu Empire, I can help you resolve it. Perhaps, only when you truly witness my strength will you believe all this.\" A multicolored light appeared between Nian Bing's eyebrows, and in the center of this multicolored halo, a golden starlight rose. The pressure from the fusion of the Huangji and Tianyan acupoints reappeared. Mu Jing was not the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, and Nian Bing did not need to use much mental power to make her realize with horror that she had lost the ability to resist. Nian Bing before her became even more mysterious and powerful in her heart. The feeling of being unable to speak gradually straightened Mu Jing's chaotic thoughts.\n\nThe light receded, and everything in the room returned to normal. Mu Jing gasped for breath, \"You are really willing to help me get rid of that person? What is your purpose? What do you want to gain?\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"What I say will be kept. I have no purpose in helping you, and you don't need your Langmu Empire to do anything for me. I have no good feelings towards divine beings.\"\n\nMu Jing looked at Nian Bing suspiciously and said, \"That's not right. In my opinion, you have your own purpose in everything you do. As a member of the Rong family, how can you exert yourself for the Bingyue Empire like this? Can the Rong family tolerate you doing this? Frankly, what do you want to get from our Langmu Empire? If you are willing, you are very welcome to join our Langmu Empire. We can give you the same things that the Bingyue Empire gives you.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled and said, \"Why don't you believe me when I tell the truth? Do you want me to ask for your virginity like Zhamulun? I'm not that low-class, am I?\"\n\nMu Jing's pretty face turned red. \"You have three confidantes whose beauty surpasses mine, so you naturally wouldn't care about me. Who knows if you're telling the truth.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing smiled indifferently and said, \"I have already got what I want. There is nothing that you, Langmu Empire, can attract me. The reason why I am willing to help you get rid of that god is for the sake of Yangon's Great Wall and for our three countries' alliance.\" He can't tell Mu Jing that the Bingyue Empire is under my control. Can't you give me the entire country?\n\n\n\nMu Jing was stunned for a moment and said, \"I need to consider your words. The genius will be called after the Four National Public Conventions. Before that, I will give you an answer.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing stood up and said, \"Then I will tell you first. Mu Jing, you are a smart girl. In fact, politics is a man's business, so why bother too much? Isn't it good to be your princess?\"\n\n\n\nLooking at Nian Bing's back as he left, Mu Jing couldn't help but look confused in her eyes, yes!\n\n\n\nI am just a woman. What good is it for me to participate in these politics? Who is Nian Bing? If he can kill Zamulun, his strength has reached that level, but he is so young!\n\n\n\nThe evening crowd ate some food in the National Restaurant. When they came late at night, the dark sky was not shining because of the clouds. After eating, the rosy returned to the room and continued to cultivate his body. The three daughters of Long Ling may have run back to the room early because of Nian Bing's sleep. Nian Bing flew alone to the top of the B&B room, looking at the dark night sky and thinking.\n\n\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priest left, and Nian Bing's mood relaxed a little. After all, she would be more troublesome. However, the look she looked at herself before the Ice and Snow Goddess Sacrifice left. What exactly did she want to do? Will you attack your parents when you go back? No, it won't. If she wanted to do that, she wouldn't have waited until today, Dad, mom, you wait. \n\n\n\nIn another hundred days, I will go and click on you. Finally, you can enjoy the joy of heaven too. When you see that your son has grown up and has three excellent wives, you will be very happy. Your hardships are about to pass. I will definitely find a piece of joy and live there with you. Let you enjoy the fun of playing with santhemums.\n\n\n\nA storm blew over, causing a few more stars in the sky. Seeing the stars bright after that moment, they were immediately covered by clouds, Nian Bing couldn't help but think of everything he had born in the Great Land of God.\n\n\n\nUntil now, he could not confirm whether the time between him and Kao was an illusion in consciousness or it actually existed. When he came to wake up from the lake of life. Kao seemed to have never had anything to do with her, and she returned to her cold appearance. The four true gods should not belong to this world. When will their next battle begin?\n\n\n\nAs the starlight was blocked by the clouds, everything around him turned back to darkness. Nian Bing lay on the top of the room and looked at the dark sky. His heart was very calm, and the energy of the Tianyan point and the Huangyang point at the center of his eyebrows was smooth and steady. The golden physical energy cannot tell what is contained in it.The Lizhong acupoint, which had been opened on the chest, was completely compressed and condensed by death energy, and was elevated to the ultimate state. Unfortunately, it was precisely because of the huge death energy that he could not use the ability of this slumber. Kao and Tianxiang once told him that if one day he could completely control the death and vitality in his body. Then, he can reach the realm of a true god, even if he cannot compare with their four true gods.\n\n\n\nThere will be no difference. Nian Bing also tried to explore the Lizhong acupoint during his cultivation, but at least the Tianyan acupoint can still regulate mental power, but he cannot use his mental power to attack himself. However, the Lizhong acupoint, which concentrates the death black ball, is like a piece of iron plate. No matter how he tries, he cannot use his mental power to feel the energy inside. Every inquiry will bring a sense of terror to himself. Later, he simply stopped trying and let it go. Perhaps it is not certain that the death energy in this Lizhong acupoint can be opened only after opening several other acupoints. \n\n\n\nAlthough Mu Jing did not give him a clear answer today, Nian Bing believed that Mu Jing no longer had any other choices, and being able to cooperate with him was the best way out for the Langmu Empire. After this incident is over, I no longer have to relate to politics. As long as the mainland is stable, even if the gods of God really come to find trouble, it will not be so easy to succeed. Nian Bing believes that the current Yangon Land will never be any worse than the lost land at the beginning. Even if the God Land really wants to make some plans, it will never be easy to succeed. What is the case? What attracts them is this paradise human enjoyment. If the human beings are destroyed, then what they will get will be a God Land with a slightly better environment. After understanding these, Nian Bing will not worry much about the Yangon Land.\n\n\n\nWith a smile, a faint divine light appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. The Four National Public Conference will depend on the situation on the day of the debate. Judging from the current situation, it is completely within his own control. Calculate the time. It should not be long before the Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony, which is far from the phoenix Nirvana Ceremony, and is worshiping the Ice and Snow Goddess. Before the 100-day appointment, and before the day when the Meordas sealed the bottle, I had time to go with the women and the others. In this way, even if the tribe is in trouble, I might be able to help myself. When I think of the women's excited appearance, Nian Bing felt that his decision was very correct.\n\n\n\nHe turned over and rose. At this time, the night had already deepened. Most of the people in Dutian City had entered the dream. Do you feel like going back to sleep? Nian Bing smiled slightly and had another idea in her mind.\n\n\n\nUnder the support of light wind, he floated down from the outside of the National Palace Museum. Although the guards around the National Palace Museum are strict, for experts like him, guarding is simply like a virtual device. \n\n\n\nNo sound was made, Nian Bing had already arrived in front of the one-shoulder window. With the control of mental power, the wind element condensed, quietly opened the window's head from inside, reached out and sucked it. The window had already opened. Nian Bing's body watch drifted in like a long smoke, and brought the window with her hands.The room was darker than outside. When Nian Bing just stepped onto the ground, his heart was filled with warning signs. A dark red light hit his shoulder from behind. The girl's low voice sounded, \"Who is that?\"\n\n\n\nThe room that Nian Bing stole was lived in by the three of Feng Nu. He was here to steal the fragrance and jade, but he didn't expect Feng Nu to react so quickly. A fire ignited on the other hand of the woman, although it was a struggle. But it also has the same effect of lighting. The burning breath on the God of Heaven made Nian Bing dare not move a little. Although he was very confident in his physical strength, he did not dare to use a sharp weapon that was different from this artifact level.\n\n\n\n\"I said to my wife, don't you think you want to kill your husband?\" Nian Bing said a little embarrassedly.\n\n\n\n\"Ah! Why is it you?\" The burning air disappeared in a hurry, the sword had already been sheathed, and the nine-way fighting air on his hand was still burning. The bird girl looked at Nian Bing in surprise, not knowing whether it was because of the flames or the shame that the wind girl's pretty face became red and scattered, and was extremely moving.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's arrival woke up Bingyun and Long Ling, who had already entered meditation at the same time. For a while, three and two beautiful eyes were concentrated on him. It was too late. Nian Bing sneaked in, and there was something else that could happen. The three girls were all in shame at the moment, looking at Nian Bing, waiting for his explanation.\n\n\n\nNian Bing said a little embarrassedly, \"I'm just here to see you. I didn't expect you to be asleep.\"\n\n\n\nThe girl in the geese smiled and said, \"You can only be a lie. Come and see if you don't walk through the main door? You're sneaky, and you can't have any kindness at first glance.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing raised her hand to pull the girl, \"I can't sleep at night and don't want to surprise others. Isn't it more convenient to come in from outside?\"\n\n\n\nThe girl hid over Nian Bing's hand, turned around and ran to Bingyun, lifted the quilt and dripped it in quickly. It caused Bingyun to be amazed. The girl said, \"He must have no kindness. Sister, we can't let him succeed.\" As soon as she hid, the only light in the room disappeared, and the whole room was in a darkness. The atmosphere had changed a little differently. With Nian Bing's Tianyan hole, she could naturally see everything in the room. But he didn't want to destroy the current atmosphere and didn't have the ability to open the Tianyan hole, so he sat down on the girl's bed.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"When you say this, I came to see that my wife has become a big mess. I'm wronged! I haven't had the opportunity to chat with you these days. I'm not here to find you specifically.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling laughed and said, \"I can't even cheat you. I just said that I would sleep with our quilt during the day, so I ran to steal it at night. Well, you want to chat with us, and Sister Feng also gave you the bed, so you can sit there and chat with us.\" As she said, she hurriedly pulled the quilt and wrapped her body in it, as if she was afraid that Nian Bing would steal her.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"Sheng Ye, I know you are the most obedient. I have finally come here so I must have someone to hug me. In this way, I will communicate with you better!\"\n\n\n\n\"Bah, who wants to communicate with you, Sister Ling should not be treated by him.\" The young woman wrapped herself and Bingyun's cushion with a quilt. They all knew that Nian Bing's sky eyes could see everything, so she hurriedly protected her cushion with only her pajamas. \n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at the three girls with no trace at all, and he could not use his strength. He let out a helpless voice and lay down on the girl's bed, no longer saying a word, feeling the darkness around him, listening to the unstable breathing of the three girls, and vocalizing the faint fragrance from them in the air, his heart couldn't help but feel a little intoxicated.\n\n\n\nNaturally, the three girls of Long Ling didn't really want to resist Nian Bing, but they were together. Who was embarrassed to be enthusiastic with Nian Bing, but they had some expectations deep in their hearts. Hearing that Nian Bing, who was still thinking about taking advantage of her, suddenly lost his voice. The three girls couldn't help feeling a little strange. Lan Chen tried to find out, \"Nian Bing, aren't you going to chat with us? Why don't you say anything?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing is so smart that she has heard a lot from the words that Lan Chen tried some time, so she made a helpless sound and said, \"I think I have three wives, but none of them makes me feel warm. I'm in the mood to chat. I'm asleep. You should rest early.\"\n\n\n\nHe said, pulling up the quilt and covering it on his head. Although his actions were like this, his ears were swollen and he heard the silence of the three women.\n\n\n\nThrough the feeling of mental power, Nian Bingying touched the girl with a light touch and said to the girl with a low voice: \"Sister, he isn't really angry. He has been tired all day long, or, or...\"\n\n\n\nThe girl laughed and said with a loud voice: \"Will he get angry about this little thing? Then he is not Nian Bing anymore. Sister, don't behave like him! We are on the same line of war, he has to sleep. Let him sleep well. At worst, I'll take you and I'll take a blow today.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing felt distressed, but the woman knew her best! It seems that it is unlikely to take advantage of it tonight. He was about to speak, but the dragon on the other side was moving. The dragon quietly lifted up his quilt and diamonded it out of the bed. \n\n\n\nThe room was originally two beds, and the middle was not very large. Now there were three, and the left and right sides were within reach. Long Ling quietly reached his hand to Nian Bing, grabbed his big hand and pinched it gently, as if comforting him, so that he would not be angry. Holding Long Ling's smooth and soft little hand, Nian Bing felt a warm heart. After all, the soul was still the softest! Even though I know that I am a dresser, I still don’t feel at ease. The little hand that tightly held Long Ling's hand and rubbed it gently on her forearm. The broken skin was so comfortable to touch her hands that Nian Bing's heart couldn't help but become hot.\n\n\n\nLong Ling's movements were very careful, and the room was very dark, and it did not attract the attention of Feng Nu and Blue Chen. Although Feng Nu thought that Nian Bing was made of, after she opened her mouth, she couldn't help but feel no silence in her heart.Since Nian Bing died once, whether she or Lan Chen, she regards Nian Bing as he is heavier than before. He finally came back. The Feng Nu didn't want to make him feel uneasy. What's wrong? They have already decided that they will not marry if you are not married. What's the relationship between him and him? Thinking that she had kept a distance from Nian Bing during this period and refused his hot request, the Feng Nu couldn't help feeling a little apologized, but she was still in the bed again and said to Lan Chen beside her, \"How about you go and accompany him?\"\n\n\n\nAfter hearing this, Lan Chen couldn't help but feel ashamed. The scenes of the first scene appeared before his eyes again. He hurriedly slammed his head and said in a low voice: \"Sister, go ahead. You are the eldest sister, so you should be the one who has to do it.\"",

    "content": "Feng Nu hesitated for a moment, then whispered, \"Nian Bing, Nian Bing, are you asleep?\"\n\nNian Bing was eavesdropping on their quiet conversation while caressing Long Ling's small hand. Hearing Feng Nu ask him a question, he didn't reply, maintaining his original posture.\n\nFeeling a bit helpless, Feng Nu emerged from the covers, thinking to herself, \"It's pitch black in the room anyway. Even if anything embarrassing happens, my two sisters won't see it.\" With a shy and anxious heart, she got out of bed and sat on Nian Bing's side of the bed, lifting the quilt from his head.\n\nAs soon as Long Ling heard movement from Feng Nu's side, she immediately withdrew her hand, her speed astonishing even Nian Bing.\n\n\"Hey, don't play dead,\" Feng Nu said with annoyance, tapping Nian Bing on the head.\n\nNian Bing grabbed her small hand, pulled her forcefully into his embrace, and smiled, \"You came to me yourself. Let's see how you'll run now.\"\n\nNestled in Nian Bing's warm embrace, Feng Nu said petulantly, \"Run where? I knew you wouldn't have any good intentions.\" Although she spoke like this, she proactively snuggled closer to Nian Bing, her bouncy body completely melting into his embrace. She then pulled the quilt over to cover them both.\n\nNian Bing had come to find Feng Nu and the others not to do anything in particular, but to inquire about the Phoenix Nirvana ceremony. He also wanted to have some intimate time with his three wives. As he embraced Feng Nu's delicate body, his heart began to race. He felt a dryness in his throat and instinctively tightened his grip on her. Feng Nu was even more nervous than Nian Bing at this moment, burying her head deeply in his chest and refusing to look up.\n\nNian Bing's one arm was around Feng Nu, while the other moved behind her back, feeling the smooth, supple skin beneath the thin sleepwear. The desires within him grew stronger.\n\nBing Yun and Long Ling could clearly hear Nian Bing's rapid breathing, while Feng Nu's breathing was noticeably suppressed. Both women's hearts began to race, and they wrapped themselves tighter in their quilts, pretending to sleep. However, their ears were perked up, listening to Nian Bing and Feng Nu's every move.\n\nAmong the three women, Nian Bing had always loved Feng Nu the most. From their first meeting, Feng Nu's stunning beauty had left a deep impression on him. He had held Feng Nu before, even shared more intimate moments. But like this, in the darkness, between the warm sheets of the bed, it was the first time. This was the intimacy only shared by husband and wife! How could Nian Bing not be excited?\n\nNian Bing shifted his embrace upwards, making Feng Nu start. In her shyness, she softly cried out, \"No.\" At this moment, her voice had lost all its former authority, becoming soft and weak. But these simple words truly made Nian Bing stop.\n\nHolding Feng Nu, Nian Bing suppressed the fire of desire within him. He cursed himself. Feng Nu was willing to sleep beside him, so how could he push his luck? They were in the State Guest House of the Huazong Empire, with Lan Chen and Long Ling nearby. If he were to take Feng Nu right here, she wouldn't resist, but it would be too unfair to her. Moreover, it would make Long Ling and Bing Yun feel neglected. Just holding her like this was enough to satisfy him.\n\nWith that thought, Nian Bing softly said, \"Feng Nu, I won't do anything out of line. Will you listen to me?\"\n\nFeng Nu let out an annoyed snort as a form of assent. In her heart, she thought, \"You say you won't do anything out of line, then what's that hard, throbbing thing down there doing?\" Even though she thought this, with her sisters and Long Ling nearby, how could she possibly say it out loud?\n\nNian Bing hugged Feng Nu tighter, moving his lower body, which had been pressed against her thigh, to the side. He sighed softly and said, \"Among you three, I met Feng Nu first, then Ling'er. Only after that did I meet Chen'er. If we're talking about who I met earliest, it was actually Chen'er. However, we were all too young back then. I know that all four of us are currently in an awkward situation. Because of your love for me, you tolerate each other and tolerate me. You are all so outstanding. To have even one of you as a wife would be the greatest fortune of my life. Now, you are all willing to make yourselves uncomfortable to stay by my side. I truly don't know how to repay your love.\"\n\nListening to Nian Bing's heartfelt words, Long Ling and Lan Chen couldn't help but peek out from their quilts and turn towards Nian Bing. Neither of them spoke. As Nian Bing said, they were all so outstanding. It was impossible for them not to have had any thoughts about the injustice of sharing a husband with the other two. They all wanted to hear what Nian Bing had to say.\n\nNian Bing continued, \"Perhaps, if that incident of my 'death' hadn't happened, you wouldn't have made these choices. Ling'er's gentleness has always made her meek. Her love for me has never changed. For me, she has shed countless tears. Although she feels wronged, she will definitely stay by my side; I can be sure of that. As for Bing Yun, although she appears cold on the surface, her heart is very passionate. That time, by chance, we became husband and wife, and you can't leave me. Even if you wanted to leave, I would never allow it. But, Feng Nu, I understand that if I hadn't 'died' back then, your final choice would have been only one: to fulfill your sister's wishes and leave me. Am I right?\"\n\nFeng Nu's delicate body trembled slightly in Nian Bing's embrace. She said nothing, but Nian Bing could feel her body trembling slightly.\n\nNian Bing gently stroked Feng Nu's long, rosy hair, continuing, \"Yes, I've wronged you all. In my heart, I can no longer let any of you go. If Feng Nu had truly made that choice back then, I wouldn't have blamed you, because you wanted to fulfill your sister's wishes and hoped Chen'er could have more happiness. However, I know that your love for me will never change. You would rather sacrifice your own happiness to fulfill others. Chen'er, Ling'er, perhaps you will be unhappy with my words, but I don't want to lie to you. In my heart, I have always loved Feng Nu the most. Ling'er, you've always wanted to ask me why I rejected Xue Jing back then. Actually, Xue Jing's temper was only one reason. The more important reason was Feng Nu. That's why I rejected you. For the same reason, because I realized Feng Nu had already occupied my heart. However, later, when you wanted to use that spell to save everyone in the Fire Dragon Cave, I saw your determination. I also understood that if I couldn't accept your feelings, you would probably never be happy in your life. Your gentleness touched me. I could no longer refuse you. Today, we can finally talk properly. Feng Nu, Chen'er, Ling'er, promise me that from now on, no matter what happens, all four of us will be together. Never leaving each other, letting go of the barriers in our hearts. I will treat you all equally. You are all women I love. I will never show favoritism. Can you? Can you promise me this request?\"\n\nSilence. In the dark room, only the sound of their breathing could be heard. Nian Bing's heart was filled with emotion. He held Feng Nu tighter and noticed that his collar was already wet with her tears.\n\nAfter a long while, Lan Chen sighed and said, \"Nian Bing, before we answer you, can you answer one question for me? I've always wanted to ask you, if it wasn't for eating that fruit and us becoming husband and wife, what would you have done with me? Can you tell me? Honestly, I want the truth.\"\n\nNian Bing hesitated for a moment and said, \"Chen'er, I hate your master. I hate her for taking away my parents. Therefore, when I first saw you, although I was surprised by your beauty, I also hated you. However, as we interacted more, I found out you were a kindhearted girl. But my heart was conflicted. Remember when we went to Bingyue City with Mao Mao? Actually, I had already started calculating your moves on the way. I had planned to capture you in a secluded place after the matter in Bingyue City was resolved to ask about my parents' whereabouts. As our interactions continued, I found that I was starting to have second thoughts about taking action. I was surprised then. That was the first time I hesitated on my path of revenge, and that hesitation was because of you. But I still captured you later. Between the hesitation and my hatred, hatred still prevailed. Chen'er, do you know when I realized I had fallen in love with you? It was when we first entered the cave, and I wanted to force you to tell me my parents' whereabouts. At that time, looking at your lifeless eyes, my heart ached so much. It was at that moment that I regretted it, regretted hurting a girl I had already fallen in love with. You and Feng Nu cultivate different abilities, ice and fire, respectively. However, you sisters share similar qualities that attract me. If we hadn't had that union back then, perhaps I would have just buried this feeling deep in my heart. That time, I knew you wanted to poison me for revenge, but it was those fruits that dispelled my hesitation. Do you know? During the time we lived in the cave, I always hoped it would continue. In that secluded place, returning from hunting every day and making delicious food for you to taste, my heart felt incredibly comfortable.\"\n\nGasping sounds came from Lan Chen's direction. The knot in her heart that had existed all along finally disappeared with Nian Bing's words. All this time, she had always felt that Nian Bing only wanted her because of their physical relationship, not because he truly loved her. Nian Bing's affectionate explanation completely dispelled her doubts, and her heart was completely open to him. Her choked sobs were so moving.\n\nNian Bing turned his words to Long Ling. \"Ling'er, I know you have similar doubts in your heart. I also know what you are thinking. You might think that I am with you out of pity. You are wrong. If I hadn't truly fallen in love with you and was only pitying you, at most, I would have handled it like Xue Jing's situation – either choosing to distance myself or helping you find a good home. I fell in love with you in the Fire Dragon Cave, the moment I covered your mouth with my hand as you began to chant that spell. Although I knew you were willing to sacrifice yourself to protect everyone's safety, I knew that you were truly doing it only for me. A girl willing to give her life for me, if that couldn't move my heart, then I would truly be made of stone. I always remember your kindness to me. Among you three, my guilt towards you is the deepest. I have hurt your heart! After I helped the Seven Dragon Kings repel the powerful enemies in Hanling, the first thing I thought of was to return to Bingxue City to find you, because I didn't want you to cry for me anymore. Forgive me, Ling'er. I will do my utmost to bring you happiness.\"\n\nChoked sobs and weeping filled the room. Nian Bing expressed his deepest love to the three women in different words. He hid nothing, speaking his true feelings. With his sincerity, he opened the hearts of the three women, breaking down the last barriers in their hearts. Although they were crying, Nian Bing's heart felt exceptionally comfortable. He continued to gently stroke Feng Nu's long hair behind her back and smiled, \"From today onwards, I won't let you maintain your distance from me anymore. Today it's Feng Nu, tomorrow it's Ling'er, the day after tomorrow it's Lan Chen. Each night, one of you must accompany me. I won't let you off. Perhaps I couldn't give you a formal ceremony, but I have given you my heart. Not a heart divided into three parts, but three identical hearts.\"\n\nFeng Nu reached up and grabbed Nian Bing's chest, wiping her face and then her nose. She looked up at Nian Bing's face and said, \"You're so wicked! You had to make us all cry? Tomorrow morning, our eyes will be swollen. Let's see how you explain it to my mother.\" Although her voice still carried a hint of a sob, it was incredibly affectionate.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"We are all mages. I can think of at least ten ways to reduce swelling. Originally, I didn't intend to talk about this with you today, but I realized that although you are happy since my return, you all have something on your minds. If these concerns aren't resolved, you will never be truly happy. Therefore, I have spoken my true feelings. I have laid my heart bare to you without any concealment. My three wives, do you think you can accept this fragile heart of mine?\" He deliberately put on a pitiful expression, and his voice carried a hint of teasing. But the three women knew that everything he said was not a joke.",

    "content": "Feng Nü chuckled, \"Alright, stop pretending. We're sisters, after all. Don't think you can divide and conquer us. Humph, you think just because you say we have to accompany you one by one every day, we will? Dream on.\"\n\nNian Bing quickly hugged Feng Nü tightly and grinned, \"I need to reassert my authority as the husband. This isn't your decision to make. Ling'er, Chenchen, what do you say? Is my plan good? Taking turns every day, you won't lose out.\"\n\nLan Chen and Long Ling jumped off the bed almost simultaneously, both performing the same action: pulling their beds towards Feng Nü's bed in the center. Nian Bing was momentarily stunned by their actions and asked, \"What are you two doing?\"\n\nLong Ling and Lan Chen exchanged a glance. In the dark room, their eyes shone brightly. They possessed the same Heavenly Eye acupoint as Nian Bing. Although their spiritual energy was much weaker than Nian Bing's, they could still see everything in the room if they wished. The two women wiped away their tears and smiled faintly, speaking in unison, \"We don't agree with your decision. Why should you be the one to decide? We believe that sleeping together in one big bed is the best solution.\"\n\nNian Bing was initially taken aback, then overjoyed. Three single beds pushed together were very wide. With a cheer, he immediately pulled Long Ling and Lan Chen over, hugging one, then the other. His heart was blooming with happiness like a flower.\n\nNian Bing's sudden move drew gasps from the three women. Feng Nü grabbed Nian Bing's hands and chided, \"No fooling around.\" One quilt wasn't big enough. At this point, three quilts were overlapped, covering the four of them. Nian Bing nestled against Feng Nü's body, lying in the very center of the bed. He lightly kissed Feng Nü's pretty face and said, \"I'm being intimate with my wife. How is that fooling around?\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled faintly and said, \"No mischief, okay? This is the Huá Róng Empire, and you're here on official business. We agreed to sleep with you, but you can't fool around, alright? Didn't you say you wanted to accompany me and Chenchen back to the Phoenix Clan? After the Phoenix Nirvana Sacrifice Ceremony is over, we'll do as you wish. Before the ceremony, I... I can't lose my virginity. If you really can't help yourself, then let Chenchen accompany you.\" As she spoke, she pulled Chenchen's small hand and placed it in Nian Bing's.\n\nShe had never forgotten that she was a member of the Phoenix Clan.\n\nChenchen shyly leaned against Feng Nü's other side, \"Sis—\" Her heart suddenly sped up. Was she really going to... with him in front of her sister and Long Ling? It was too embarrassing.\n\nHolding Chenchen's hand, Nian Bing laughed, \"Look, it's all your fault for being too attractive. I almost forgot about business. I came here to have a heart-to-heart talk with you, and also to ask you about this Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony. The Four Kingdoms Public Opinion Conference has been basically arranged on my end, and we're just waiting for the signing of the peace treaty on the day of the actual negotiation. After the meeting the day after tomorrow, we'll leave immediately. Your Phoenix Clan should be in the Lǎng Mù Empire, right? We'll go back with Miss Nà Mù Jīng and help her with a small favor along the way. Feng Nü, tell me about this Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony, and how long until the ceremony begins? That way, I can make arrangements. I think Mom will definitely go, and Chenchen will naturally accompany you. Ling'er and Brother Xǐ Lǔ can also go together. With so many of us, no matter what unexpected situations arise, it will be much easier to handle. I promise you.\n\nBefore the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony concludes, I will absolutely refrain from any improper conduct towards you.\"\n\nFeng Nü pulled the quilt, covering Nian Bing, and nestled into his arms again. \"Yes! It's time to tell you about our Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony. I doubt even Chenchen knows about it. Our Phoenix Clan is located in a large forest northwest of the Lǎng Mù Empire. Although it's in the northwest, because there is a huge volcano in the center of the forest, the temperature is much higher than other places in the north. The soil is very fertile, promoting the dense growth of various plants, hence its name, the Fiery Wood Forest. Our Phoenix Clan resides within a patch of Phoenix Trees in this dense Fiery Wood Forest. Phoenixes perch on Phoenix Trees; you must have heard of it. That is the most suitable place for our cultivation. Whether it was me or my mother, after becoming the Hopeful Phoenix of our clan, we both went to cultivate near that volcano. There, there is a secret passage that we secretly opened, leading directly to the interior of the volcano. In that place full of lava, the fire element is extremely concentrated, and cultivating the Nine Li Battle Qi there is twice as effective. And that is where the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony is held.\" As she spoke, a hint of worry flickered in Feng Nü's eyes, as if she remembered something.\n\nUpon hearing Feng Nü's words, Nian Bing's heart stirred. \"Does this volcano have any connection to your Phoenix Clan? Or perhaps to your deceased Phoenix Empress?\"\n\nFeng Nü nodded and pressed closer to Nian Bing's chest, feeling a little more at ease. She sighed softly, \"Actually, even we don't know if our ancestor, the Phoenix Empress, is in that volcano. According to our Phoenix Clan's legends, when the Phoenix Empress perished, she fell to the ground and formed this volcano. The volcano contains the Phoenix True Fire. Although the Phoenix Empress is gone, this Phoenix True Fire within the Phoenix Volcano protects our Phoenix Clan. Every hundred years, the Phoenix True Fire in the Phoenix Volcano erupts once, which is what we call the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony. During the ceremony, we must combine the efforts of our Phoenix Clan experts, using the Nine Li Battle Qi to its fullest to restrict it, so that the volcanic eruption does not affect the entire forest. Therefore, the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony is both a ceremony to commemorate the Nirvana of the Phoenix Empress and a time for our self-preservation. To protect our Phoenix Clan's ancestral land, we must go all out to contain the volcanic eruption within a certain range. In less than a month, another grand ceremony will begin. I believe that as long as my mother and I can return in time and join forces with a few elders, we will be able to successfully complete this ceremony. However, I am worried that the elders might not agree to let my mother and me participate.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned, \"They don't agree to your participation? Then how will they handle this volcanic eruption? Will they just watch their homeland be destroyed by the raging lava?\"\n\nFeng Nü sighed, \"The elders are very stubborn. Otherwise, they wouldn't have expelled my mother from the clan back then for following my father. The elders know very well that it's difficult to handle the volcanic eruption without my mother's help, yet they still chose that path. With your decision to return with us this time, I've been hesitating all along. If you go too, things might become even more difficult to resolve. I'm afraid...\"\n\nNian Bing tightened his embrace around Feng Nü, \"Don't be afraid, I'm here. Even if your elders don't agree to let you return to the clan, we can still contain the volcanic eruption! I don't believe an ice-elemental Divine Descent spell¹ can't calm that volcano down. I understand your feelings for your clan members, and I understand your current dilemma. Although those elders are stubborn, they are not unreasonable people. They should understand the importance of the matter and not let their stubbornness lead to the destruction of the Phoenix Clan's homeland. As long as we sincerely help, they will understand your and Mom's intentions.\"\n\nFeng Nü said, \"Actually, this isn't my biggest worry. There's a saying passed down in the Phoenix Clan: 'When the Ice Phoenix appears, the Phoenix ascends.' Our clan's ancient texts record that once an Ice Phoenix appears, the eruption of the Phoenix Volcano's True Fire will reach its peak. I'm afraid this Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony won't be easy to get through. Chenchen's Ice Phoenix physique has awakened. She is the key this time.\"\n\nLan Chen was surprised, \"Sister, why haven't Mom told me about this? I'm also a member of the Phoenix Clan. Don't worry, with Nian Bing here, nothing will go wrong.\"\n\nFeng Nü turned and held Lan Chen's hand. \"Mom didn't tell you because she was afraid of burdening you, but with the ceremony about to begin, I can't keep it from you any longer. Mom told me that when you were born, she realized you might be the Ice Phoenix physique that our clan only sees once in a thousand years. Our Phoenix Clan's rules state that once an Ice Phoenix appears, it must be immediately thrown into the Phoenix Volcano to sacrifice to the Phoenix Empress. How could Mom bear to see you harmed? That's why she sent you to the Ice God Pagoda to become a disciple of the Ice Snow Goddess's priestess, partly to protect your safety, and partly to preserve the secret of your Ice Phoenix physique. When we return this time, the first challenge we'll face isn't the calamity brought by the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony, but the questioning from our clan members.\"\n\nLan Chen's delicate body trembled slightly. She had always been somewhat confused as to why her mother sent her to the Ice God Pagoda, only seeing them once a year. After hearing Feng Nü's words, she finally understood that Yu Ru Yan had done this all to protect her! Her eyes welled up slightly. She gripped Feng Nü's hand and said, \"Sister, don't worry, no matter what, we three, mother and daughters, will always be together. With our strength, we will definitely get through this difficulty. Moreover, with Nian Bing and Ling'er here, even if the Phoenix Clan members want to harm us, it will be impossible.\"\n\nFeng Nü said, \"Things are not as simple as you think. Among fire-elemental magic, the most intense flame is the Purple Heavenly Fire. And when the Phoenix ascends, during the Nirvana Grand Ceremony, under the legendary appearance of the Ice Phoenix, the volcanic eruption will no longer be ordinary lava, but the world's hottest Phoenix Nirvana True Fire. Its temperature is far beyond comparison to the Purple Heavenly Fire. How can it be easy to contend with it?\n\nWithin the Phoenix Volcano lies the foundation of our Phoenix Clan's bloodline. The Phoenix Tree forest is where we have lived for thousands of years. If the ceremony cannot be completed, then the Phoenix Clan will surely perish!\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Legends are just legends after all. I'm afraid none of the surviving members of your Phoenix Clan have ever witnessed the power of that Phoenix Nirvana True Fire. Anything is possible. Worrying too much now is of no use. Our best option is to take it one step at a time. Once we reach your Phoenix Clan, there will be a way to deal with it. Don't worry too much.\"\n\nFeng Nü nodded, \"I hope so. Perhaps there will be some method in our clan's ancient texts. Nian Bing, I spoke with Mom today about you returning with us. Mom didn't object, but she didn't agree either. I suppose her worries are the same as mine. If our clan members see you, they might be even more resistant. Moreover, this is the most significant matter within our Phoenix Clan.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"You and Chenchen are my future wives, so in a way, I can be considered half a member of the Phoenix Clan. I can't rest assured leaving you to face those Phoenix Clan fellows.\"\n\nLong Ling, who had been silent all along, said, \"Yes! I'm going with Nian Bing, and I also want to see what your Phoenix Clan's dwelling place looks like. Sister Feng Nü, please don't worry. In the past two years, your strength has reached such a high level. Even if that Phoenix Nirvana True Fire is terrifying, it is still fire originating from the Phoenix. Would your ancestor, the Phoenix, harm you?\n\nFeng Nü's eyes lit up upon hearing Long Ling's words, \"Yes! The Phoenix Nirvana True Fire is the ancestor Phoenix's strongest flame. How could the ancestor use his flame to harm his descendants? There must be something peculiar about this. Perhaps this is not a bad thing, but rather an opportunity for our Phoenix Clan. Among the Nine Phoenix Transformations, the strongest so far is the Sixth Transformation. My mother and I have both reached the Sixth Transformation. However, no matter how much we cultivate, even if our Battle Qi reaches the level of a Divine Master, we cannot break through to the Seventh Transformation. I have a feeling that the last three transformations of the Nine Phoenix Transformations cannot be achieved solely through cultivation. There must be some secret involved. Chenchen, what stage of the Phoenix Transformation have you reached?\"\n\nBefore Lan Chen could answer, Nian Bing asked in surprise, \"Isn't Chenchen an Ice Phoenix physique? How can she cultivate this so-called Nine Phoenix Transformations?\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled and said, \"Why can't she cultivate it? The Nine Phoenix Transformations are not based on the Nine Li Battle Qi, but are a special cultivation technique that only members of our Phoenix Clan can practice. As long as one possesses royal blood and has self-awakened the Phoenix Feather, they can cultivate to deeper levels. Chenchen's Ice Phoenix Wings appeared when she was with you last time. Later, I taught her the method of the Nine Phoenix Transformations. Her progress is no slower than mine. Chenchen, I think you've probably reached the Fifth Transformation by now.\"\n\nLan Chen nodded, \"Yes! I've reached the Fifth Transformation and have been diligently cultivating recently. If I could cultivate with Nian Bing's return and with the assistance of the Heavenly Eye acupoint, I could reach the Sixth Transformation within half a year at most. However, there isn't enough time now, and I'm still only at the Fifth Transformation. I don't know if I can help you at the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony.\"",

    "content": "Feng Nu pondered, \"Based on your capabilities, you can naturally help. As far as I know, the past Phoenix Nirvana Ceremonies were all jointly completed by five elders who had reached the third transformation. And judging solely by strength, although you follow a magical path, the fifth transformation is at least equivalent to two third-transformation elders. With our strength and Mother's, even if the volcanic eruption during the Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony doubles in intensity, we can handle it. My only concern is the Phoenix Nirvana True Fire. However, according to Ling'er, perhaps this is indeed an opportunity.\"\n\nLan Chen nodded and said, \"I agree with Nian Bing's viewpoint. Thinking too much now is useless. After arriving at the Phoenix Clan, we will carefully examine the clan's scriptures and combine them with the situation at the time to find the best solution. Sister, if, if in the end my life is truly needed to withstand the Phoenix Nirvana True Fire, I...\"\n\n\"Don't say that,\" Nian Bing interrupted Lan Chen. \"You are my wife, and I will absolutely not allow anyone to use your life for anything. If it truly comes to that, Feng Nu, don't blame me. Even if the Phoenix Clan suffers a calamity because of it, I will never let Chen Chen be harmed in any way.\" His words were decisive, leaving no room for negotiation. Initially, Nian Bing thought that Feng Nu and Yu Ruyan would be enough for the Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony. He agreed to go with Feng Nu primarily because he didn't want to be separated from her. But now, hearing that the ceremony might have complications, he understood that he had to go. Protecting his wife was something he had to do, and no one could influence Nian Bing's decision.\n\n\"Nian Bing, I...\" Lan Chen's voice choked up again. Nian Bing gently comforted her, \"Alright, don't think too much. It's very late, let's sleep. After the Four Nations Consensus Conference, I will immediately return to the Phoenix Clan with you. I don't believe that if I could overcome the Death Pass, this Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony can trouble me.\" His words were filled with confidence, confidence stemming entirely from his strength. He was no longer the Nian Bing who had walked out of the peach blossom forest, whose primal magic might have issues at any moment. Now, he was one of the strongest on the Continent of Lumina. He had absolute confidence in himself. Even if things became impossible, protecting his wife was not a problem.\n\nNian Bing tightly embraced Feng Nu, who was nestled in his arms, and held Long Ling's small hand with his other. One husband and three wives, they slowly drifted into dreamland together in the large bed. The agitated emotions gradually calmed in the dark room. At this moment, no one wanted to cultivate like they usually did; they all savored this warm and unusual night. With their emotional knots untied, Nian Bing had finally truly won their hearts.\n\nTwo days passed quickly. The Four Nations Consensus Conference was held in a side hall of the Huaron Empire's imperial palace. The theme of this conference was naturally peace talks. The conference was presided over by the Huaron Empire's Prime Minister Su Yue, known as the continent's foremost strategist. Early in the morning, Nian Bing, along with Mu Jing and Luo Rou, arrived at the side hall. According to the Huaron Empire's requirements, each person was allowed to bring only one guard. Accompanying Luo Rou was naturally Yu Ruyan, and accompanying Nian Bing was the dwarf Xi Lu. Mu Jing's accompanying guard should have been the divine-level expert Zhamulen, but unfortunately, Zhamulen had already been killed by Nian Bing and Xi Lu working together. Yesterday, she had spoken with Nian Bing again. Before coming here today, Nian Bing had arranged a guard for her: Feng Nu, who carried the Li Tian Sword and bore the six transformations of the Phoenix. Originally, Mu Jing had some doubts about Feng Nu's strength. In her opinion, among the three women with Nian Bing, Lan Chen, who was formerly from Ice Cloud, should have been the strongest. But when Feng Nu effortlessly severed a crow a hundred feet away in the void with the Li Tian Sword, Mu Jing's doubts vanished. Her understanding of Nian Bing's unfathomable depth deepened further, and she no longer had any doubt about Nian Bing having killed Zhamulen.\n\nFour wooden tables were placed opposite each other, signifying that the Huaron Empire viewed the four nations as equals. Nian Bing and his group did not wait for too long. Huaron Empire's Prime Minister Su Yue and Prince Rong, who commanded the empire's armed forces, arrived together. Prince Rong dismissed the attendants in the hall and sat down with Su Yue. Although Su Yue was advanced in age, he showed no signs of frailty; his spirit was vigorous. Looking at the three young people before him, he couldn't help but smile slightly and say, \"It seems the future world will belong to you young people. I am old, and I'm afraid my time to serve the empire is limited.\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled slightly and said, \"Prime Minister Su, you are vigorous despite your age. We juniors are far from comparable to you. I am representing the Orlan Empire here, and I am more eager to learn from you.\"\n\nSu Yue gave Luo Rou a deep look. He had dealings with Luo Rou many times in Orlan City, the capital of the Orlan Empire. He knew very well that although this woman was young, she was not only knowledgeable but also extraordinarily intelligent, and by no means an easy opponent. He smiled and said, \"Prime Minister Nuoer has arrived. I am old, but rest assured, Su Yue will not do foolish things like relying on his age to bully others.\" As he spoke, he chuckled, and the originally somewhat tense atmosphere in the hall immediately relaxed. \"The reason I invited the representatives of the Langmu, Bingyue, and Orlan Empires here today, I believe you three are already very clear. I would like to hear the opinions of your three envoys. If our opinions can be unified, then there will be no need to waste too much time here, and I can go back to rest earlier. I wonder which of you would like to speak first?\"\n\nLooking at the smile on Su Yue's face, Nian Bing secretly thought, \"This old man, who is as famous as Grandpa, is indeed difficult to deal with.\" With just a few words, he deftly pushed the three nations forward. Luo Rou smiled slightly and said, \"I abstain. Before coming here, I spoke with the representatives of the Bingyue Empire and the Langmu Empire. Our Orlan Empire has decided to defer to the Bingyue Empire in all matters.\"\n\nSu Yue was taken aback. He had naturally met Nian Bing before. Nian Bing had left a deep impression on him during the Five Nations New Elite Mage Competition. Hearing Luo Rou suddenly shift the focus of the discussion to Nian Bing, he couldn't help but look upon this young man with even greater admiration. He naturally knew that Nian Bing was the representative of the Bingyue Empire and had discussed Nian Bing with Prince Rong. All of Prince Rong's actions were unrelated to the Rong family, and no matter how Su Yue tried to probe, Prince Rong did not offer much explanation. Su Yue was well aware of the intelligence of Luo Rou, who had taken the alias Nuoer. His original intention was to focus the negotiation on Luo Rou, who represented the Orlan Empire, because the Orlan Empire shared the widest border with the Huaron Empire, and the terrain was flat. If the three nations wanted to take military action against the Huaron Empire, they would inevitably have to pass through the territory of the Orlan Empire. Therefore, as long as the Orlan Empire agreed to peace talks, this matter would be much easier to resolve. However, now Luo Rou had played a masterful defensive move, pushing everything onto Nian Bing, the representative of the Bingyue Empire, clearly showing full confidence in him. Could it be that this Nian Bing was not only powerful in magic but also more outstanding in politics than Luo Rou? Although the peace talks had just begun, Su Yue felt he was already at a slight disadvantage. He had investigated Nian Bing before, but the information he obtained was extremely scarce. He of course did not know that as the leader of the Blood Lion Cult, all of Nian Bing's information had long been classified as top secret. Although Nian Bing had not given the order, his subordinates had already provided the best concealment for him.\n\nAs soon as Luo Rou finished speaking, before Su Yue could ask Nian Bing, Mu Jing spoke up, \"Our Langmu Empire's stance is the same as the Orlan Empire's. We defer to the Bingyue Empire in all matters.\"\n\nWhen Mu Jing said this, even the shrewd Su Yue's expression couldn't help but change. The Langmu Empire had always been at the forefront of confronting the Huaron Empire. He could never have imagined that the usually aggressive Langmu Empire would also defer to the Bingyue Empire, which rarely participated in continental conquests. Moreover, Mu Jing's concealment was clearly not as good as Luo Rou's. As she spoke, there was a hint of respect in her gaze towards Nian Bing. Su Yue noticed all of this. Nian Bing's status in his mind naturally increased further, and his original plan was completely disrupted at this moment.\n\nHearing Luo Rou and Mu Jing successively decide to yield the floor to Nian Bing, Prince Rong couldn't help but be surprised. Looking at his grandson sitting calmly opposite him, he couldn't help but secretly praise, \"This kid is much more formidable than I imagined. The Blood Lion Cult doesn't even have news of him connecting with the Langmu and Orlan Empires. When did he start arranging all this? In this way, he has become the key to the negotiation.\"\n\nSu Yue's smile remained undiminished, his gaze fell on Nian Bing, who also wore a smile. \"Since the Langmu and Orlan Empires are willing to heed the Bingyue Empire's opinion, please speak, Nian Bing, as the representative.\" He used the word \"heed\" very effectively, aiming to sow discord among the three nations. Unfortunately, this had no effect on Nian Bing and the other two. Su Yue naturally understood the seriousness of the situation. The statements from the Langmu Empire and the Orlan Empire clearly indicated to him that the three nations had united and secretly formed an alliance. It seemed that his trip to the Orlan Empire had been in vain.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, picked up the tea in front of him, and took a sip with composure. He put down the teacup and said, \"Prime Minister Su, you are too kind. Nian Bing has long heard of Prime Minister Su's great name, and this is my second time meeting you. To simultaneously represent the Bingyue, Langmu, and Orlan Empires in expressing opinions, Nian Bing is extremely honored. Firstly, we all understand the reason why the Huaron Empire convened the Four Nations Consensus Conference. I would like to first hear Prime Minister Su's explanation for your country's sudden attack on the Qiluo Empire and its annexation of the Qiluo Empire. The continent's five nations have been at peace for a hundred years, but the changes brought about by the Huaron Empire's actions... other than invasion, I cannot think of any other purpose the Huaron Empire has. And it is rather laughable, in my opinion, that the Huaron Empire convened this consensus conference shortly after acquiring the entire territory of the Qiluo Empire.\"\n\nSu Yue glanced at Prince Rong. Prince Rong sat beside him with his head bowed, as if he hadn't heard anything. Su Yue smiled calmly and said, \"There seems to be some misunderstanding regarding this matter. It is not that our Huaron Empire intended to invade the Qiluo Empire, but rather that the Qiluo Empire first deployed heavy troops near our border, showing signs of aggressive intent. We received information that the Qiluo Empire intended to launch a surprise attack on a strategically important town in our eastern frontier. We had no choice but to dispatch troops to defend our national territory. Later, due to the Qiluo Empire's excessive arrogance, we entered their borders, purely to issue a warning. As you all should know, our army did not occupy any cities in the Qiluo Empire, nor did we destroy their national government. As for the subsequent annexation, it was because the Qiluo Empire willingly surrendered and pledged allegiance to our country. It is precisely because of this that our country, fearing misunderstanding from the Bingyue, Langmu, and Orlan Empires, convened this meeting to declare our peace-loving stance and to reach this peace agreement.\"\n\nUpon hearing Su Yue's words, Mu Jing couldn't help but exclaim, \"Prime Minister Su's words seem only capable of fooling a three-year-old. If you hadn't captured the capital of the Qiluo Empire and apprehended members of the Qiluo Empire's royal family, how could they possibly surrender? Even if what you said is true and this was merely a misunderstanding, then how do you explain Prince Rong leading a large army into our borders last time, burning and plundering?\"\n\nSu Yue feigned surprise and said, \"Didn't Princess Mu just say that everything defers to the Bingyue Empire? What, have you changed your mind now?\"\n\nA flash of anger flickered across Mu Jing's face, and she was about to retort when Nian Bing's voice echoed in her mind, \"Calm down, don't fall for Su Yue's trick.\" She forcibly suppressed her anger and sat there, remaining silent.\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"What Princess Mu mentioned is precisely the question I wanted to ask. In recent years, the Huaron Empire's military movements have been extremely frequent. Is this truly your peace-loving stance?\"\n\nSu Yue replied, \"That is also a misunderstanding. As you all know, there is a large mountain range between our country and the Langmu Empire, making transportation extremely inconvenient. In order to facilitate better trade, we found a way to open a new road. Who would have known that this would cause a misunderstanding with the Langmu Empire, who believed we intended to go to war? As a result, their border defense troops attacked us, and our soldiers could only resist. You should all know that our army did not kill a single civilian when counterattacking. In fact, after repelling the Langmu Empire's attack, we immediately withdrew to our own territory. As for the plundering mentioned by Princess Mu, I have no idea where that information comes from. I have not received any news in this regard. Perhaps it was just a rumor, or perhaps it was bandits within your borders taking advantage of the situation. If that battle caused any impact on the Langmu Empire, I apologize on behalf of the Huaron Empire.\"",

    "content": "Mu Jing's anger flared. Just as she was about to retort, Nian Bing's voice echoed in her mind, \"What's done is done. Arguing with him on this point will gain you nothing. Endure it. After all, we came here for peace talks today. I believe you understand what I mean. Anger serves no purpose, and your losses cannot be recovered.\"\n\nMu Jing took a deep breath, calming her turbulent emotions. She let out a cold snort and did not answer Su Yue.\n\nSu Yue had indeed intended to provoke Mu Jing. He realized that Nian Bing, the person before him, was not easy to deal with, while it would clearly be much easier to break through Mu Jing. However, when Mu Jing, who had just been arguing with him, heard his denial of the previous battle with the Langmu Empire, she didn't get angry. Su Yue immediately felt that today's negotiation would be even more difficult.\n\nNian Bing said, \"The past is past, and the current situation has been formed. Prime Minister Su, since the Huarong Empire wishes to hold peace talks with our three empires, I hope your country can show some substantial sincerity.\"\n\nHe didn't want to delay any longer and went straight to the point. Since the Olann Empire and the Langmu Empire had already expressed their support for him, Su Yue should understand the situation of their three united empires. His provocation had yielded no results, so it was time to lay their cards on the table.\n\nSu Yue nodded and said, \"Since it is a peace talk, we naturally have sincerity. As long as the Bingyue, Langmu, and Olann empires are willing, we can sign a non-aggression pact for twenty years. If any party violates it, then the other three empires can jointly punish them.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Prime Minister Su, you just spoke of sincerity and then proposed such terms. I don't see your sincerity.\"\n\n\"Let's be frank. The reason the Huarong Empire proposed these peace talks is because they fear our three empires uniting to wage war against the Huarong Empire. If the Huarong Empire wishes to wage war again in the future and violate the pact signed today, they will inevitably have to oppose all three of our empires simultaneously. In that case, this pact would be nothing but waste paper; what effect would it have? Prime Minister Su, since we are sitting here today, and since I have the support of the other two empires, I am genuinely willing to negotiate peace with you. I hope the Huarong Empire can also show some real sincerity, so we don't come here in vain. If war breaks out now, I don't think it would benefit the Huarong Empire or us three empires at all. Weapons should not be wielded lightly, but we are not afraid of resolving the current situation through force.\"\n\nSu Yue's smile gradually disappeared. \"Then I would like to hear it. What good proposal does Representative Nian Bing have?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"I wouldn't call it a proposal, but the most important point of this peace talk is that the Huarong Empire must make us three empires feel that you will no longer pose a threat to us. At least not within the twenty years stipulated in the pact. Only then can we sign the pact with peace of mind.\"\n\nSu Yue pondered for a moment and said, \"This is probably very difficult. How can your three empires feel secure? Your standards may not be our standards. I hope Representative Nian Bing does not make excessive demands.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"I have absolutely no intention of making excessive demands; otherwise, I would not be negotiating with you like this. I just hope you understand that starting a war now would be far more detrimental to the Huarong Empire than to our three empires.\"\n\n\"Firstly, in terms of military strength, although our three empires' forces are dispersed and may be at a disadvantage in the early stages of a war, our Bingyue Empire is renowned for its production of weapons and equipment, while the Langmu Empire is most famous for its grain production. If we unite, reinforcements will continuously appear on your country's borders. Perhaps your country's two top knight orders are what you rely on, but in the face of Divine Descent techniques, even the strongest knight orders will only meet their doom. Our Bingyue Empire is not as simple as you imagine, with only one Divine Descent Master.\"\n\nSu Yue was startled. \"Oh? I haven't heard that another magic expert has appeared in your country at this time.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"I wouldn't call myself an expert. But if I didn't have the strength of a Divine Descent Master, how could I have taken the position of the Bingyue Empire's Chief Court Mage?\"\n\n\"You...\" Su Yue looked at Nian Bing in shock. He naturally wouldn't believe everything the young man before him said. He had seen Nian Bing's strength before; although he was already a leader among the younger generation, if he were to claim to be a Divine Descent Master, no one would believe him.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, and the Heavenly Eye on his brow gradually lit up. This time, the light from the Heavenly Eye was golden, and immense pressure instantly permeated the entire venue. His pressure radiated outwards. Within its range, everyone's body trembled simultaneously. Mu Jing's expression changed drastically, and green light surged around her body. Yu Ruyan and Feng Nu's bodies were enveloped in red light, and black battle qi protected them. (The dwarf, cannot type the word, thank you). They all collapsed to the ground under the sudden immense pressure, continuously boosting their strength. However, Nian Bing's pressure was based on spiritual power, and even the Ice Snow Priestess could not resist it, let alone them. On Nian Bing's side, besides Nian Bing himself, only Luo Rou remained seated without being affected. On Su Yue and Prince Rong's side, Prince Rong's expression changed greatly. He had intended to protect Su Yue, but he, who had reached the realm of a Divine Descent Master, was horrified to find that under this immense pressure, he could barely protect himself, let alone help others. Su Yue looked at all this in a daze. Like Luo Rou, he was not attacked by the pressure. However, he was too familiar with Prince Rong's strength. Seeing the purple light around Prince Rong's body fluctuate violently and continuously shrink, he couldn't help but be horrified. Nian Bing, just sitting there without moving, could exert such great pressure on everyone present. This represented how powerful his strength was! A Divine Descent Master, this was definitely the strength that only a Divine Descent Master could possess, or even surpassed the realm of a Divine Descent Master, otherwise, his old brother Prince Rong would not be in so much pain.\n\nThe pressure appeared quickly and disappeared just as quickly. In just a few breaths, everyone felt a sense of lightness and returned to normal. Nian Bing smiled slightly and nodded at Su Yue, saying, \"Prime Minister Su, this junior apologizes, but if I don't make some demonstration, I'm afraid Prime Minister Su would hardly believe my words. Now, I think you have nothing else to doubt.\" As the pressure disappeared, the first to stand up was (the dwarf). Then Prince Rong, Feng Nu, and Yu Ruyan recovered. Mu Jing, however, sat slumped in her seat, gasping for breath, her eyes filled with confusion. She was clearly still immersed in the terrifying pressure. This time, to create a deterrent effect, Nian Bing activated the golden sphere that fused his Huangji and Tianyan acupoints and fully exerted his spiritual power. Although he appeared unchanged on the surface, he felt a wave of weakness in his own mind.\n\nStrength often proves everything. If it were just the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, Su Yue would not be so wary.\n\nBut now, with the unfathomable Nian Bing appearing, he had to think more. Just as Nian Bing said, no matter how powerful a knight order was, there was no luck in the face of Divine Descent techniques. He was hesitating. Now he had two choices. One was to kill all the envoys present, including Nian Bing, and immediately launch an attack on the three empires. The other was to make concessions during the peace talks. As he thought, his gaze turned to Prince Rong, signaling for his inquiry.\n\nPrince Rong shook his head and made several gestures to Su Yue under the table. Su Yue immediately understood his meaning and sighed inwardly. He said, \"Alright, then let's discuss the details of the peace talks. Our Huarong Empire is very sincere. Since the Bingyue, Langmu, and Olann empires have formed an alliance, we Huarong are willing to coexist peacefully with you and not infringe upon each other.\"\n\nUnder the deterrence of strength, the subsequent negotiations went much smoother. Prince Rong's gestures to Su Yue under the table were to tell him that none of the people on the other side were easy to deal with. From Nian Bing's spiritual pressure earlier, one could see the strength of their abilities. At the same time, Prince Rong also told Su Yue that even his own forces could not deal with Nian Bing. This was equivalent to telling Su Yue that if these few people wanted to leave, even his own Rong family guards would absolutely not be able to stop them. Moreover, this was in the Huarong Empire; once the envoys of the three empires encountered an attack, it would be equivalent to forcing the three empires to immediately attack the Huarong Empire.\n\nAfter much bargaining, the two sides gradually reached a consensus. At this time, one could see the difference in abilities. Mu Jing could only interject occasionally. On the side of the three empires, the main negotiators were Nian Bing and Luo Rou. Every question and doubt they raised was opportune, matching Su Yue tit for tat. At the same time, as the negotiations progressed, Nian Bing increasingly admired Prime Minister Su Yue, who was as famous as his grandfather. Compared to him, Luo Rou, although not inferior in intelligence, had a significant gap in experience and the comprehensiveness of her consideration of issues. Coupled with Nian Bing, they could barely contend with Su Yue on equal terms. After nearly four hours of negotiations, the two sides finally reached an agreement. The three empires jointly signed a peace treaty, stipulating that neither side would attack the other for twenty years. In order to show sincerity, the Huarong Empire would not build any defensive fortifications within 500 li of the border between the Qilu Empire and the Olann Empire during the twenty years that the treaty was in effect. At the same time, the Huarong Empire must open the mountain pass connected to the Langmu Empire and allow Langmu Empire merchants to trade. Due to the previous invasion of the Olann Empire, the Huarong Empire also needed to compensate the Olann Empire with ten thousand purple gold coins. Originally, Mu Jing wanted to fight for some benefits from the Huarong Empire, but Su Yue insisted on his stance, and in the end, they only obtained these benefits. The most important of these was naturally the provision of no defenses within 500 li of the original Qilu-Olann border. Furthermore, no troops were allowed to be stationed within 500 li. In this open land, three thousand-man squadrons from each of the three empires would supervise, while the Huarong Empire's defenses must be placed more than 500 li away. It was precisely because of this point that the negotiations lasted for such a long time. With the combination of Nian Bing and Luo Rou, they finally reached the bottom line of Huarong and gained an advantage in the negotiations.\n\nAs the representatives of the three empires left the side hall, the Huarong Empire's Prime Minister Su Yue felt a dizzy spell. As he stood up, he swayed and almost fell. Fortunately, Prince Rong supported him, preventing him from falling. Prince Rong said with concern, \"Ah Yue, are you alright? Are you feeling unwell?\"\n\nSu Yue sighed and said, \"I'm old, no longer what I used to be. Fighting with these youngsters all day with our wits is too exhausting. Old Rong! You were right; they are all too outstanding. As long as Nian Bing and Luo Rou are here, it will be almost impossible for our Huarong Empire to unify the continent. No, I must advise the Emperor tomorrow. The twenty-year treaty signed today must be honored. Old Rong, do you know? I suddenly realized a problem, a problem that has been completely wrong. We have relied too much on our own abilities and have neglected the cultivation of the next generation too much. Once we are gone, who will support the Huarong Empire? Old Rong, don't you have any regrets?\"\n\nPrince Rong shook his head and said, \"I never regret things that have already happened. Ah Yue, it is indeed time for us to cultivate successors.\"\n\nAlthough the Olann Empire gained the most benefits on the surface from this negotiation, looking deeper, the Langmu Empire and the Bingyue Empire also gained considerable benefits. Nian Bing did not return to the state guesthouse with everyone, but went alone to the secret hall of the Blood Lion Sect. He directly instructed the Blood Lion Seven Elders to send people to transmit the agreement reached here to Bingyue City to Xue Po, and asked Xue Po to inform Yan Feng that he would not be returning to Bingyue City for the time being. The Four Nations Public Opinion Conference ended entirely according to Nian Bing's vision. He understood that as long as Su Yue was here, the Huarong Empire's aggression would be temporarily halted.\n\nAs the Phoenix Grand Ceremony was approaching, in order to gain time to communicate better with the Phoenix Clan, Nian Bing and his party did not stay long and left Dutian City on the night after the negotiations. As they walked out of the north gate of Dutian City, the western ocean in the east brought a scarlet glow to the distant sky. The envoys of the three empires gathered together. The hundreds of people from the Langmu Empire surrounded several carriages.\n\nAt this moment, the three imperial envoys had stopped their journey. Nian Bing and the others got out of the carriages and walked towards the Olann Empire's envoy delegation. Yu Ruyan and Luo Rou also got out of their carriages.",

    "content": "I want to go back\n\n\n\nAh\n\n\n\nI wish you a smooth journey.\" Although Luo Rou smiled and said this, there was a bit of separation and sorrow in her two wise eyes.\n\n\n\nYu Ruyi took Luo Rou's little hand and said, \"Rou, be careful all the way. This time, all I brought were the elites of the Silver Feather Riders Group. They will definitely send you back safely. As soon as the matter is over at my aunt, I will return to Oak City immediately. My god! You have to pay attention to your body. In the past two years, you have been too busy. This won’t work. You must practice your mental skills by giving me your mind. \"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou pointed at her head and said, \"Auntie, don't worry, I have me in the Oregon Empire, and my body is not very strong.\" I'm waiting for you to come soon in the Empire. Miss Bing, don’t forget our appointment!\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Of course I won't forget it.\" \"The piece of gem that Luo Rou gave him was now in his space ring, and the gem of gem had been given to the Seventh Old Blood Lion. With their arrangements, Nian Bing didn't need to worry about anything. Luo Rou looked at her with a look of a strange look. Nian Bing didn't think much about it, so she stepped forward and pulled her little hand. His actions couldn't help but startle Luo Rou, her face was filled with shame, and Yu Ruyi's face changed. The three dragon spirits behind Nian Bing's body stared at him with wide eyes.\n\n\n\nThe soft light radiated from Nian Bing's body. First, the milky white light of the sacred was transmitted into her body through his little hand holding Luo Rou. Then, a feeling filled with the breath of life radiated from Nian Bing's body. The milky white light turned into ink green, which was completely condensed by the breath of life. Surrounded by the ink green light, Luo Rou's reverence was shaking slightly, and the huge breath of life stimulated her life magnetic field to continuously emit beautiful melodies. Luo Rou is not only the one who benefits. Even the attendants of the three countries around him clearly feel that under the breath of life, his body is so comfortable. Mu Jing, who had just walked down from the horse, saw the ink green light scattered on Nian Bing's body, and couldn't help but shook his whole body. The same light green light spread out from her body. At this moment, her eyes were filled with complex expressions. Only by cultivating natural magic can she truly feel how powerful the life energy produced by Nian Bing is. The surging breath of life nourishes every body in the field. Others can last for at least one year under the nourishment of this breath of life, and Mu Jing feels this great vitality that is completely consistent with herself, and her goddess of life has been greatly enhanced. The breath of life emitted by Nian Bing is completely selfless. Mu Jing used her fastest to reach Nian Bing's back, fully feeling the pleasure brought by the vitality. She now couldn't see everything about this man even more clearly. Not only did he possess profound and unpredictable power, but he also had great vitality many times stronger than him. \n\n\n\nThe ink green light is from the chest of Nian Bing. Without lasting for too long, the light harvested. At first, the great vitality taken from the lake of life and the vitality generated by the change of life breath after being integrated with Kao were also condensed into a green bead, which stayed next to his Lizhong acupoint, and circled around the Lizhong acupoint and slowly rotated. First, it presses the death ball in the Lizhong point, and at the same time, it also provides Nianbing with incomparable vitality. When Nian Bingwei just saw Luo Rou, he consumed a lot of vitality because of his excessive work. If she does not receive effective treatment and recovery, she may not survive her thirty-five years old. For this wise woman, Nian Bing not only felt a little sad, but also had a few fans respected her. She was about to be separated soon, so he naturally would not give up this opportunity. His own vitality has already reached a difficult-to-name height because of the condensed energy ball of life. He only needs to dissipate a little life breath from Luo Rou's body, which is enough to restore her consumed vitality, and even has huge benefits for her body. In the process of the appearance and disappearance of the ink green light, Luo Rou is naturally the one who benefits the most, followed by the Wood Crystal, which cultivates natural magic. Under the nourishment of the breath of life, Luo Rou felt a wholehearted feeling. She had never felt that her body was so comfortable. Every point and every drop in her body was filled with the breath of life. Everything around her seemed much clearer, because her body was extremely comfortable, she couldn't help but moan.\n\n\n\nWith a smile, Nian Bing relaxed Luo Rou's hand, \"Okay, don't be too careful about anything you do. I stimulate your life magnet and supplement what you need most. Don’t be too tired in the future. Leave more time to repair your temper and fight, which will be more helpful to your body. Pay special attention to your diet. You must practice your fighting spirit as much as possible. Only in this way can you completely absorb these vitality and you will not feel weak again in the future. Remember, don't be too tired. \"\n\n\n\nLuo Rou lowered her head. , no one can see the look in her eyes now, \"Thank you. \"After saying these three words, she turned her horse and issued an order, and withdrew from the three countries' envoys under the protection of the Silver Feather Riders. Nian Bing stopped watching the Orland Empire envoy disappear from the far side, and Shu Luo Rou regained his vitality. He also felt very happy.\n\n\n\nThe girl from Feng walked to Nian Bing and said, \"You need to give us an explanation. What did you and Luo Rou make a decision?\"Nian Bing finally woke up from the joy in her heart. She looked back at the girl, smiled bitterly and said with her mental power, \"I will give you an explanation, don't misunderstand.\" \"What made him most excited in these few days was not the successful controversy of the four countries' public conferences, but the fact that he could sleep with his beloved wife every day. Although it is difficult to endure, it will be much better to put their minds in meditation state when they are sleeping on the floor. Although Bing didn't really have anything to give birth to, but for the past two days, Nian Bing has fallen in love with this feeling. She was sleeping with a girl holding her in her arms the day before yesterday, and yesterday she was a dragon spirit, so she should have been to Blue Chen tonight. When he thought of the thing that Blue Chen had had with him, his heart would become unusually hot. At this time, he saw the girl in Feng asked him about him, and there was also a ray of doubt in Long Ling and Blue Chen's eyes, so he hurriedly explained to the girl in Feng. I'm afraid they will think too much.\n\n\n\nMu Jing looked at Nian Bing in confusion. He wanted to say something, but he never said anything. He whispered a low voice and went back to his own horse. Nian Bing and his five-member team and Yu Ruyi sat on a wide horse. Under the cluster of the Langmu Empire, they embarked on a new journey towards the Langmu Empire.\n\n\n\nAs soon as they got on the horse, the three girls asked their own questions. Because Yu Ru was there, Nian Bing was confused about the bloody Lion. He just told them the request he made to him. \n\n\n\nThe young girl pinched Nian Bing's thigh without any worries. He gasped in pain, \"With us, aren't you satisfied?\" Also go to seduce Luo Rou. \"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly and said, \"I'm wronged!\" I can't seduce others, but Luo Rou said that in the future, I want to let us leave a house for her when we live in seclusion. Can I not answer? \"\n\n\n\nYu Ruyun looked at Nian Bing, who was being hiding by the three female tigers, and smiled and said, \"Hey, do you really don't understand or you don't understand it? If Luo Rou had no affection for you, how could she send you a token? That can be a token of agreement, the same is true. It can also be a token of love. You are so young! \"\n\n\n\nAs soon as he heard Yu Ru's smoke, the eyes of Fengnv, Blue Chen and Long Ling became even worse. Nian Bing only felt a pain in three parts of his body at the same time. He was about to make a sound, but Fengnv reached out to cover his mouth. \"Luo Rou and I are really nothing, I just think she is friends! Let me go, I'm really wronged! \"Nian Bing put out a look of a slutty look. I wanted to gain some sympathy, but the three daughters clearly didn't let him go. Lan Chen said quietly, \"There is nothing now, it doesn't mean there will be nothing in the future, sister, how do you say we should wake him up now and let him not mess with you?\"\n\n\n\nThe girl held back the smile in her heart. He said, \"This is not easy, I have my own way. You may not be confused by the way he has put it on, and who can't be soft-hearted.\"\n\n\n\nNo need to ask, Nian Bing also knew what the girl was going to do. She just enjoyed two nights of good times and was probably about to end. She looked at them helplessly and thought to herself, Luo Rou, you are harming others.After leaving Dutian City, the envoy of the Langmu Empire first moved northeast, crossed from the east side of Tianlang Mountain, and five days later, it had entered the Langmu Plain. They didn't encounter any trouble along the way. When they arrived in the plains, the time to move forward was approaching.\n\n\n\n  Surround the official road of Langmu Empire, heading straight to the Langmu Empire’s capital, Hualin City. Nian Bing asked the girl of Fengmu, who told him that the Huomu Forest, where the monk is located, is located in the 600-six-home west of Fenglin City. Because of the Fenghuang Volcano, there are few people crying near the Huomu Forest. Going to Fenglin City first and then to Huomu Forest will not waste too much time.\n\n\n\nIt has been eight days since we left the capital Tiancheng. It was almost evening, so the group had arrived at the Red Wood City, which was only a road from Yanlin City. Mu Jing, Nian Bing and Yu Ruyi discussed and decided to rest here for a night. The next morning, the whole road was closed and the battle to return to Yanlin City earlier. As Princess Mu Jing, they quickly moved into the most luxurious hotel in the city, and their subordinates arranged everything. For the past eight days, most of the time I spent sleeping in the wild. Today I stayed in a luxurious room, so everyone could have a good rest.\n\n\n\nAfter dinner, Nian Bing took the initiative to find Mu Jing. Mu Jing was the princess of Langmu Empire. In the most luxurious room, there were hundreds of square meters in the large hall alone. Mu Jing let Nian Bing in the sand, so he made him a cup of fragrant tea with his hands, and smiled and said, \"What's the matter with me?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"There is also the sky that I will arrive in Fenglin City. However, the power of the God-level master of the Great Land of God will probably destroy Fenglin City if it fights in the city and will also panic the people in Fenglin City. So I think if I want to kill that guy, I must be outside the city.\"]\n\n\n\nMu Jing pointed at the head and said, \"What you said makes sense. Do you mean, do you want me to cheat him out of the city and act outside the city?\" \"As he said, he sat down next to Nian Bing with a cup of tea.\n\n\n\nMu Jing took a shower and the pure fragrance after bathing was mixed with his natural fragrance. It was particularly comfortable in his nose, and the sand was not very big. As soon as she sat down, she could not touch Nian Bing's body. Mu Jing didn't wear much, so she could almost do it in the place where people touched her. I felt the smooth skin under the skirt, and I couldn't help but silence in my heart. I moved a little to the side, and said, \"The princess is a wise man. It's not that difficult for the god to leave the city. We are just outside the city to help you solve this trouble and change it to a time of different ways.\"\n\n\n\nMu Jing took the fragrant tea in her hand and took a sip. She glanced at Nian Bing beside her, and couldn't help but reveal a resentful look. Then are you so anxious to leave? That Zamuren once said that I am the body of a congenital spirit wood. Any man who gets my first time will have great benefits for cultivation. Nianbing, I think it is difficult for me to find a true love person. If you are willing, I want to give my body to you. I don’t want anything. I just hope that when the Langmu Empire encounters danger, you can help us a few points. \"As he said, he leaned on Nian Bing's shoulders with a handsome and shy look.Although he is the best one of the next generation of the royal family of Langmu Empire, and at the age of Leisure, she has reached the realm of a demon, but she is still just a girl. She has no hesitation for her country, but she is really nervous when facing Nian Bingshi. He knows that today is the last opportunity. If she can use her body to change the peace of Langmu Empire in the future, she thinks it is worth it. When Nian Bing showed his powerful power at the Four Nations Conferences, he already had this idea. It was not until Nian Bing treated Luo Rou that he really decided to do this. Whether Nian Bing's strength was still in the influence of the Ice Moon Empire and the Austrian Empire, he knew that it was absolutely worth it.\n\n\n\nNian Bingbi was still a normal man. Mu Jing was originally beautiful, and because of the relationship between the natural touch of cultivation and the substitute of innate spiritual wood, the special vitality contained in her body was very attractive to Nian Bing's own aura. When he approached Nian Bing's body and slapped his arm, the strong strangeness could not help but invade Nian Bing's heart.",

    "content": "Nian Bing did not expect Mu Jing to choose this way, and naturally understood her purpose. For her country, a young girl was about to sacrifice her most precious possession. Feeling Mu Jing's rapid heartbeat, Nian Bing could not help but feel a sense of pity.\n\nPlacing the fragrant tea in his hand on the coffee table in front of him, Nian Bing gently stroked Mu Jing's smooth, long hair and sighed, \"Princess, do you think this is worth it? With your excellence, how could you not find true love? I admire your courage. When I learned that you intended to use your body to tempt Zhamulun into helping the Langmu Empire, I admired your courage. However, by using your body as a bargaining chip, you will only end up hurting yourself. Actually, I have never harbored any ill will towards the Langmu Empire, nor do I wish to be embroiled in political disputes. However, for my friends and family, I am forced to enter this vortex and contribute my part. I am not worthy of you doing this! If I were to accept you, what would be the difference between me and scoundrels like Zhamulun? That's right, I have never considered myself a good person, nor do I wish to be such a pedantic good person. However, I am not so despicable as to use my power as bait to obtain a girl's body. You are a good girl, and your persistence is all for your country. If you were not born into a royal family, perhaps you could have lived a happy life.\"\n\nNian Bing's voice was full of magnetism. When Mu Jing decided to give herself to him, she had considered many possibilities, but she had never expected him to speak to her so gently. She raised her head, her eyes slightly hazy as she looked at Nian Bing, and smiled sadly, \"Yes! Born into a royal family, I have no right to choose. Do you know? You are the first man who hasn't treated me as a tool for exploitation. In the imperial palace, whether it was my father or my brother, they only valued my abilities and the benefits I could bring them. I have never felt the warmth of familial affection from them. You are different from Zhamulun. I have never compared you to him. I know you have three beautiful confidantes, so how could you possibly fancy me? I decided to give myself to you, not entirely for the Langmu Empire. It is also for myself. I am willing, even if you do not agree to help my country, I would still choose this way. Because, don't ask why, I just want to leave myself a beautiful memory. Perhaps, only such a beautiful memory can give me the courage to live on. Nian Bing, can you trust me? What happens between us will definitely become the deepest secret in my heart. I will never use this to threaten you, nor will I tell anyone about this. This is the first time in my life that I have asked for something for myself. Can you promise me?\"\n\nListening to Mu Jing's tearful voice, it was impossible for Nian Bing not to be moved. However, he only felt pity for Mu Jing, without any trace of romantic desire between a man and a woman. He opened his arms and embraced Mu Jing in his warm embrace. His body exuded a rich life force, comforting Mu Jing's heart. Stimulated by that immense life force, Mu Jing's delicate body trembled slightly. She raised her head, and her beautiful, slightly sorrowful lips moved towards Nian Bing. Her captivating eyes naturally closed as she waited. She was waiting for the only warmth in her life.\n\nNian Bing cupped Mu Jing's face, watching as two drops of tears slid down her cheeks. He lowered his head and gently kissed her forehead. Mu Jing opened her eyes in surprise, her beautiful eyes misty. She said sadly, \"You really don't want me? I just hope to leave this memory behind. Nian Bing, am I, Mu Jing, not worthy? You are the first man to touch my body. Although I promised Zhamulun, I never let him touch my body! My body is still pure. Why? Why?\"\n\nNian Bing sighed softly and raised his hand to wipe away Mu Jing's tears. \"It's not worth it. A fleeting memory will only plunge you deeper into the abyss of pain. I can feel the pain in your heart, so how can I add to your troubles? Moreover, the desire between men and women is only perfect when it is based on love. Otherwise, desire without emotion is no different from that of beasts. I have a younger sister named Cat, she is innocent and cute, and my wives and I all like her very much. Jing'er, my love has already been given to my lovers. Would you be willing to be another sister to me? Luo Rou once made a promise with me. She said she hoped I would leave a room for her after my wives and I retired to seclusion. When the matters of Aolan are settled, she is willing to live in seclusion with us. If you are willing, I can also leave a room for you. I will not help the Langmu Empire. A royal family that lacks even familial affection is not worth my help. However, I am willing to help you, to help you escape that painful abyss. If you are willing, then call me 'brother'.\"\n\nMu Jing's body trembled even more violently. Looking at the gentleness in Nian Bing's eyes, she seemed to have returned to her childhood. All the emotions she had hidden in her heart surged forth. \"Brother!\" she suddenly pounced into Nian Bing's arms and burst into tears. The release of her emotions made her feel so comfortable, as if her physical constraints had been unbound. She could feel Nian Bing's genuine care, and his embrace was so warm, so safe. Nian Bing did not stop her from crying, letting her crystal tears dampen his clothes. He gently stroked her long hair, comforting her heart.\n\nAfter a long while, Mu Jing's crying gradually subsided. She still did not leave Nian Bing's embrace. The pent-up emotions in her heart had been completely released. She sniffled, realizing that her world was no longer as bleak as before, but so wonderful. Especially the warm embrace in front of her was so intimate. She really did not want to leave. If possible, she would prefer to remain as she was forever.\n\nNian Bing patted Mu Jing's shoulder and helped her to sit properly. \"Alright, do you feel much better after crying? Jing'er, I always keep my word. After I finish what I need to do and decide on a place for seclusion, I will definitely send someone to deliver a letter to you. Face everything bravely, abandon the burdens that should not have been yours to bear, and rediscover yourself. When you need help one day, go to the Ice Moon Empire. Just tell their king, Yan Feng, that you are my sister, and he will definitely help you. Now, you should tell me about the other god-level expert. I need to make some preparations.\"\n\nMu Jing looked deeply at Nian Bing and said, \"Brother, thank you. Although you are not my biological brother, the feeling you give me is much better than his. I will remember your words forever. Do you know, ever since I was sensible, I didn't know what I was living for? Later, as my talents gradually emerged and I awakened the Life Goddess Domain, I gradually became the most outstanding person in the Langmu Empire's royal family. But I am, after all, just a girl, and all I could do was support my brother in becoming the new emperor. Everything you have brought me today, Jing'er will remember forever.\" She took a deep breath, and the emotions in her eyes gradually subsided. Apart from her still slightly red and swollen eyes, she seemed to have transformed back into the astute and capable princess. \"The god-level expert who is with Zhamulun is called Lunxi. His strength is definitely not inferior to Zhamulun's. Brother, you should know about the seven major acupoints in the human body, right? Unlike Zhamulun, this Lunxi has opened three acupoints. He revealed this unintentionally after drinking once. At that time, he even said with disdain that Zhamulun was no match for him at all. Lunxi cultivates fire-attribute Dou Qi, and his strength is indeed very formidable. You must be careful when you confront him. This person is even more cunning than Zhamulun. Although he enjoys pleasures, he is always vigilant. It's a pity that I don't know which three acupoints he has opened, otherwise I would have more confidence.\"\n\nThree acupoints. Nian Bing couldn't help but frown. He had basically learned about the functions of the seven major acupoints from KAO. Among the seven major acupoints, the Heaven's Eye Acupoint and the Imperial Acupoint were variable factors. The Heaven's Eye Acupoint, depending on the degree of opening and the cultivation method, exhibited entirely different energies. The Imperial Acupoint, depending on its location, produced different effects and powers. As for the other five acupoints, they all had their own special functions. The Earth Spirit Acupoint at the sole of the foot represented speed. KAO had once told him that for god-level experts of the same level, those who had opened the Earth Spirit Acupoint would have double the speed of those who had not. If a person cultivating wind-element Dou Qi opened the Earth Spirit Acupoint, it would be the greatest help to him. When the Earth Spirit Acupoint was cultivated to its peak and fully activated, one would be so fast that even their shadow could not be seen, as if they were invisible, and their location could only be discerned by feeling. The Cloud Hearing Acupoint behind the ear, like the Earth Spirit Acupoint, was a paired acupoint. Once opened, two would appear. The Cloud Hearing Acupoint represented hearing, also known as the power of discernment. Upon opening the Cloud Hearing Acupoint, hearing ability would increase several times, and the user could also control the volume of their hearing at will, clearly distinguishing all surrounding sounds. When the Cloud Hearing Acupoint reached its ultimate realm, it could capture any movement within a hundred-mile radius, making it no exaggeration to call it \"clairaudience.\" At that realm, it was no longer purely about hearing, but rather a sensation through the ears of the surrounding energy fluctuations. This sensation could greatly enhance the user's observation of everything around them, making it easier to launch effective attacks during combat. The Ridge Acupoint in the center of the eyebrows mainly gathered energy. Possessing the Ridge Acupoint would greatly benefit the compression of one's own energy. Cultivators all know that only when the energy condensation degree is higher can the limited human body produce more energy, and the condensed energy will increase in power exponentially. Therefore, for both warriors and mages, the Ridge Acupoint is extremely important. As long as it exists, it is equivalent to entering another realm of cultivation, and cultivation will become much easier. Therefore, the Ridge Acupoint is also the most important acupoint after the Heaven's Eye Acupoint and the Imperial Acupoint. Unfortunately, Nian Bing's Ridge Acupoint, like his fused Heaven's Eye and Imperial Acupoints, due to storing an extremely vast amount of death energy compressed within the acupoint, its current function is only to compress that death energy and prevent it from leaking out, thus losing its original ability.\n\nWhen KAO told Nian Bing that his Ridge Acupoint had reached the ultimate realm by compressing death energy, but had also lost its original ability due to the presence of death energy, Nian Bing was extremely depressed.\n\nThe West Vein Acupoint is located three inches below the navel. Similar to the Ridge Acupoint, this acupoint is also used to condense energy. However, what it condenses is not the energy cultivated by the practitioners themselves, but the innate vital energy of heaven and earth. While cultivating with KAO and Tian Xiang on the Continent of Gods, Nian Bing truly understood the marvel of innate vital energy. The stronger the innate vital energy, the closer the human body is to nature. Humans themselves are like containers, with a certain capacity, and this capacity is not easily increased. The function of innate vital energy is to enable humans to better control all external energies in a state closer to nature. Once their own energy is saturated, the better they can control external energies, the more powerful attacks and defenses they can unleash. Although Nian Bing has not opened the West Vein Acupoint, both the ball of death within his Ridge Acupoint and the ball of life rotating around his Ridge Acupoint are the purest innate vital energies, and also opposite innate vital energies. Due to the Heaven's Eye Acupoint reaching the intermediate stage, Nian Bing absorbed the life essence from the essence of the sun and moon through the Heaven's Eye Six, and then mutated his Heaven's Eye Acupoint on the Continent of Gods. Later, he obtained a vast amount of death energy and life energy, which brought his control over innate vital energy to its peak. It is precisely because of this that he can use magic of all levels without chanting incantations, and his own consumption is reduced to a minimum. Nian Bing is somewhat looking forward to opening the West Vein Acupoint. If he could open this acupoint that condenses innate vital energy, he wonders what the effect would be. Unfortunately, the opening of acupoints is related not only to one's own ability but also to destiny. Only in special circumstances can these acupoints, which are the creations of heaven and earth, be opened. Nian Bing can only explore and attempt to open these acupoints through continuous cultivation. The Fang Jia Acupoint on the back is the only acupoint among the seven major acupoints that is primarily defensive. After this acupoint is opened, it will emit a defensive barrier similar to Dou Qi from the human body. This barrier is formed based on innate vital energy and supplemented by one's own abilities. Once it encounters external force, it will appear automatically. The Fang Jia Acupoint and the West Vein Acupoint are a pair of predestined acupoints. Only by first possessing the West Vein Acupoint, which can condense innate vital energy, is it possible to then possess the Fang Jia Acupoint. These two acupoints are also the most sought-after by god-level experts. The cultivation of the Ridge Acupoint is too difficult and carries significant risks, while the West Vein Acupoint and the Fang Jia Acupoint are relatively much easier. If the Fang Jia Acupoint can reach its ultimate state, its powerful defense is enough to survive attacks below the thirteenth level without using any other abilities.",

    "content": "Recalling the mystical uses of the Seven Apertures, Nian Bing couldn't help but speculate which three apertures this divine being named Xilun had opened and to what level. Regardless of which ones they were, they would pose a significant threat to him. The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess must have opened the Lihou and Xijing apertures, plus the Huangji aperture on her right hand. Both her Lihou and Xijing apertures had reached the intermediate stage, which is why Nian Bing concluded she possessed level thirteen strength, surpassing even the Seven Dragon Kings. The previous time he had scared off the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess was merely a bluff; if he were to face her in a one-on-one battle, Nian Bing wasn't confident he could win. The Lihou aperture, which condensed energy, and the Xijing aperture, which condensed innate energy, allowed the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess to cast level eleven forbidden spells without incantations, even at the cost of depleting her vital energy.\n\nHowever, it was still far from as effortless as it was for him. Unfortunately, in terms of absolute magical power, he was still one level inferior to her. Level twelve and thirteen were not the same concept. Fortunately, he still had his divine artifact, which narrowed the gap and gave him a slight chance of winning in a real fight. As for Xilun, who he had to deal with this time, if the three apertures he had opened had reached the intermediate stage, then no matter what those three apertures were, they would bring him considerable trouble. It seemed they would have to join forces with Xilou's power to destroy him. Divine beings, in general, should not exist in this world; their power was too immense, and they were all selfish individuals. Perhaps, destroying them one by one was the best way to preserve the original state of the Bright Continent.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing speechless for a long time, Mu Jing thought he was worried about something and couldn't help but ask, \"Brother, are divine beings who have opened three apertures really that difficult to deal with? What exactly are apertures?\"\n\nNian Bing came back to his senses and said, \"Apertures are the bottlenecks for humans to reach their limits. The Seven Apertures can be said to be seven bottlenecks. If humans can fully open all seven apertures, perhaps they can truly become gods. Do you know why my strength has improved so quickly? It's because I opened three apertures by chance. Unfortunately, the three apertures I opened are different from ordinary people's, which prevents me from truly using their abilities now. If I can open any one of the other four apertures, my abilities will definitely undergo a qualitative leap. Unfortunately, apertures are not something that can be opened just because one wants to. Jing'er, you have a unique advantage. Practice your natural magic diligently. I believe you can also open apertures.\"\n\nMu Jing nodded and said, \"Xilun and Zamu Lun both told me that if I could open a suitable aperture, I would immediately advance to the level of Archmage. Zamu Lun originally promised to help me open that suitable aperture after I gave him my body. However, I don't trust him much and have been delaying. I didn't expect him to die at your hands.\"\n\nNian Bing snorted dismissively and said, \"Zamu Lun's cultivation method is very special. He hasn't opened any apertures himself, so how could he help you? He was just lying to you. If he had really gotten your body, who knows what he would have done to you. The suitable aperture he mentioned refers to the Lihou aperture or the Xijing aperture. For us mages, these two apertures are extremely important. Opening either one can indeed propel you to the Archmage realm in a short period. Among the Seven Apertures, three are suitable for mages, and three are suitable for warriors. If you open apertures that are not suitable for you, although it will help, the help will be less. Relatively speaking, opening apertures is more beneficial for warriors. Remember what I'm about to say; it will be very beneficial for your future cultivation. Apart from the Huangji aperture, which is considered the most central point among the Seven Apertures.\n\nFor us mages, the most useful are the Kaiyan aperture, the Lihou aperture, and the Xijing aperture. The Kaiyan aperture has the greatest effect, but I haven't fully figured out its rules yet, because the effects obtained by each person who opens the Kaiyan aperture are different. However, I can tell you. The Kaiyan aperture can truly allow you to continuously improve your apertures. It not only allows you to discern the characteristics of all energy but also greatly enhances your mental strength. With enhanced mental strength, your magic control will naturally increase. Once your magical cultivation reaches a certain level, mental strength will be the focus of mages' efforts. The Lihou and Xijing apertures, on the other hand, have the functions of condensing energy and condensing innate energy, respectively. The reason I say that opening the Seven Apertures is more beneficial for warriors is mainly because these two apertures are also very beneficial to warriors.\n\nPerhaps, I am overthinking. The Seven Apertures are likely not balanced. After all, the effect of the Kaiyan aperture far surpasses that of the other apertures. And those more suitable for warriors are the Tingyun aperture, which can enhance hearing discrimination; the Diling aperture, which can increase speed; and the Fangjia aperture, which enhances defense. What I mean by suitable here is relative. In reality, opening any aperture is beneficial to us. Your future cultivation must start towards the Seven Apertures, otherwise, once you reach the Archmage realm, you will enter a bottleneck, and without opening apertures, it will be difficult to break through further. Exceptions like Zamu Lun are rare, and his cultivation method might allow him to reach the peak.\n\nMu Jing looked at Nian Bing with some gratitude. As an Archmage, she naturally understood how beneficial it was to receive guidance from a master at her level. Nian Bing's selfless guidance made her understand even more that he truly had no ulterior motives towards her, and her sense of closeness grew stronger. \"Brother, I will definitely work hard. I will cultivate diligently to better protect myself.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, ruffled Mu Jing's hair, and said with a smile, \"Alright, Jing'er, I have to go back, or your sisters-in-law will be jealous. Handle the matter with Xilun tonight, and we will deal with him outside the city.\"\n\nMu Jing sighed softly and said, \"The three sisters-in-law are truly fortunate! Brother, if only I had met you a few years earlier.\"\n\nNian Bing just smiled gently at Mu Jing and turned to leave her room, closing the door behind him. Nian Bing couldn't help but sigh in his heart. Tian Xiang had once told him that human nature is inherently evil, while Kao told him that human nature is inherently good. Now, it seemed more appropriate to believe Kao. Everyone had their own stories behind them. He wondered if those divine beings could change. Habits formed over thousands of years were probably not easy to change. Moreover, with his own strength, it was impossible to change them. If he couldn't change them, then he could only destroy them. Killing one to save ten thousand was worth it.\n\nNian Bing did not return to his and Xilou's room but went directly to Lan Chen and Long Ling's room. With Yu Ruyan accompanying them, they were no longer three people crammed into one room. Feng Nu and Yu Ruyan lived together, while Lan Chen and Long Ling had always lived together. For the past eight days of travel, Long Ling and the other two women, whether because of Yu Ruyan's presence or as a warning to Nian Bing regarding Luo Rou's matter, had not been intimate with him. During their night camps, they mostly stayed with Yu Ruyan because their godmother was present.\n\nNian Bing didn't dare to make too many overtures and could only let them have their way. However, as a normal man, it was a painful thing to have three beautiful women who were devoted to him but be unable to act on it. Nian Bing had just lied to Mu Jing; how could he not be tempted? He hadn't touched Feng Nu and the others for eight days. Heaven knows what willpower he had used to resist the temptation of Mu Jing's Wood Spirit Physique!\n\nHe knocked on the door a few times, and the door opened. Long Ling peeked out from inside. Upon seeing Nian Bing, she giggled and let him in. Nian Bing closed the door behind him. He saw Lan Chen leaning on her bed, seemingly chatting with Long Ling earlier. Nian Bing couldn't help but ask with concern, \"Are you tired from traveling continuously?\"\n\nLan Chen smiled and shook her head. \"Tired? No. In the time you were gone, we practiced continuously every day. This journey is nothing. Where did you go just now? You disappeared right after dinner?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"I just went to talk with Mu Jing. I think it's better if we don't go to Fenglin City. Your Phoenix Clan's affairs cannot be delayed. The sooner we get there and gather more information, the more confident we will be. Moreover, dealing with a divine being as high as level thirteen in the city would inevitably harm innocent people, so I asked Mu Jing to lure him out of the city, and we will deal with him outside the city.\"\n\nLong Ling proactively took Nian Bing's large hand and had him sit down. \"You've been tired these past few days too. Go back and rest early. Aren't we supposed to travel tomorrow morning?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Indeed, I need to rest well. Should I sleep on your bed or Chenchen's? This is a question that needs careful consideration.\"\n\nSeeing the mischievous smile on Nian Bing's face, Long Ling's pretty face blushed. \"You're annoying! Didn't you forget what Sister Feng Nu said? Go back to your own room and sleep.\"\n\nNian Bing reached out and pulled Long Ling into his arms, letting her sit on his lap. The full contact with her body made him exhale comfortably. Inhaling the faint fragrance emanating from Long Ling, he couldn't help but feel a little intoxicated. \"No, I'm not leaving. I've been holding back all these days. With Mom here, it's not convenient for me to be too intimate with you all. Anyway, Feng Nu and Mom live together, and she won't know if you don't say anything!\"\n\nLong Ling's pretty face turned red. She, who was always gentle, had the softest heart. Feeling Nian Bing's warm embrace and looking at his pleading eyes, she couldn't refuse him anymore. She glanced at Lan Chen for her opinion.\n\nLan Chen chuckled and said, \"What? You want to take Ling'er's first time right here? That won't do. We need a good place and a good environment. Otherwise, won't Ling'er be at a disadvantage? You should go back and sleep. What if Sister or Mom comes in and sees you? I'm afraid Sister will extend your punishment time even longer.\"\n\nFirst, he was teased by Mu Jing, and then he held Long Ling's delicate body. Nian Bing's heart was already burning with intense desire. He nodded seriously and said, \"Chenchen, you make a lot of sense. We really shouldn't be so hasty in a hotel to take our lovely Ling'er's first time.\" As he spoke, he couldn't help but sigh and helped Ling'er to her feet. Seeing his demeanor, Long Ling felt a pang of sympathy and gently tugged at his sleeve. She had already decided that Nian Bing was the only man in her life. Although virginity was the most precious thing, whether it was given early or late, it would eventually be given to him. Why make him suffer?\n\nNian Bing took Long Ling's small hand and kissed her fair fingers, eliciting a soft chuckle from Long Ling. Nian Bing's eyes flashed, and he suddenly picked up Long Ling and placed her on the bed. Just as Long Ling's heart began to race, thinking Nian Bing was about to do something, Nian Bing had already pulled the quilt over her and covered her. \"Silly girl, sleep well. Although you won't leak, I want to find a good place for your first time to leave you with the most beautiful memories.\" As he spoke, he raised his hand, and a faint blue light flashed and disappeared, extinguishing the lights in the room. Immediately after, a soft gasp from Lan Chen could be heard.\n\nAfter extinguishing the lights, Nian Bing immediately floated onto Lan Chen's bed, wrapped his arms around her delicate body, and brought his head close to her slightly cold ear, kissing it gently. He whispered, \"Since you don't want Ling'er's first time to be wasted like this, then, my dear Chenchen, you will accompany me tonight. I understand that you said that just now because you wanted me to accompany you, and how could I bear to refuse?\"\n\n\"You're annoying! It's not like that. Ooh...\" Before she could argue further, her slightly cold lips were already kissed by Nian Bing. Long Ling, who was beside them, couldn't help but secretly chuckle under the covers, thinking, Chenchen, you've dug your own grave this time. Huh? Chenchen's breathing is so heavy. What is Nian Bing doing? Long Ling's heart felt a slight warmth. She pulled the quilt and wanted to use her Kaiyan aperture to see in the dark room, but shyness stopped her. She quickly turned over, her back facing Nian Bing and Lan Chen. However, the low moans that Lan Chen deliberately suppressed but couldn't help but let out made her heart race.\n\nNian Bing, embracing Lan Chen, burrowed into the quilt. Lan Chen's slightly cold delicate body gradually melted in his warm embrace. To prevent her from refusing him, Nian Bing kissed her lips. This was also why Long Ling heard Lan Chen's gasps growing heavier. Nian Bing didn't do much; he held Chenchen, his hands moving over her back and hips, pressing her front tightly against him. Although Lan Chen had been intimate with Nian Bing once before, it had been a year and a half ago. Suddenly subjected to such a fierce assault, she was soon gasping continuously. If Long Ling could see her eyes now, she would notice that Lan Chen, who usually had clear and bright beautiful eyes, now had lustful eyes, and her fair skin was exuding an alluring pinkish hue.",

    "content": "Nian Bing moved from Lan Chen's lips, kissing her pretty face that was blown and shattering, kissing her eyes and her eyebrows. Her beautiful neck, which was as long as the sky, would make Lan Chen's slight sensation. Her hands began to push Jue from Nian Bing's chest, which had already slid behind him, and while gasping, she felt this wonderful feeling. Her body and mind gradually became open to the man she loved.\n\n\n\nNian Bing's movement suddenly stopped. He used his size to lie on Blue Chen's size and asked lightly, \"Chenchen, can you?\" Although he urgently hoped to let go of the person he loved, he would still respect their intentions. If they didn't want to, even if Nian Bing worked hard, he would not be forced.\n\n\n\nThe temperature in the quilt has increased a lot. In the warm quilt, Blue Chen felt that his body was unusually hot. He uttered a light voice, expressing his attitude. At this time, why would she refuse Nian Bing? But what made her feel ashamed was that there was a dragon spirit next to her! What did she and Nian Bing do? She didn’t hear it? However, it is precisely because of this that her heart also had a strong and strange feeling because the dragon spirit was on the side, and her body became even more hot. She was waiting, waiting for Nian Bing's real attack.\n\n\n\nAfter getting Blue Chen's response, Nian Bing didn't have any more taboos. The clothes on the two of them were reduced quickly. After a while, Nian Bing finally felt the smooth and swelling again. His hands were a little shaking, his body became abnormally hot, and the breath of life outside the Lizhong acupoint kept surging. They were still experiencing the first time, but it was completely different from the first time. At that time, they were venting the ignition of the medicine. And this time, it was released in each other's deep love. In the comfortable room, spring is rising. The pressure of the blue-Chen room moaned gradually magnified. When their bodies finally joined together, the slight painful cry rose to the extreme with satisfaction. In the deep love between each other, ** pushed towards the peak gradually. \n\n\n\nAt this time, the most thrilling thing was not the dragon spirit that was secretly heard by the side, but the Oscar who was completely sealed by his mental power when Nian Bing went to bed. The first time Nian Bing and Blue Chen was when he appeared in his witnesses. However, that time, he was blocked by Nian Bing's spirit just when he saw the previous scene. This time, he only knew what Nian Bing was going to do. At the first time, he had lost his perception of the outside world. He clearly felt that the breath of life in Nian Bing's body was constantly increasing, and the blood was moving, as if he was pushing towards a final point.\n\n\n\nA quiet night was uneven again. As the dawn light gradually shines on the Red Wood City, another morning came.\n\n\n\n\"Discuss you, you don't need to help me.\" Lan Chen gave Nian Bing a fierce look, and two groups of red rose on his pretty face. He walked out of the door with some staggering steps. Nian Bing hurriedly with satisfaction on her face and helped her to help her and said in a low voice: \"I didn't mean it, it's really you who are too tempting! And, you took the initiative to ask for it next.\"Chenchen, who looks cold, has a hot heart. After the forbidden fruit, the two people turned and turned, and the rain continued from night to dawn. Of course, like them, there was also dragon spirit. At this time, her gentle and beautiful eyes were filled with tiredness.\n\n\n\nAlthough Blue Chen was no longer a person, she had only had that one time with Nian Bing before. It would be strange that she could respond to such a night of battle. Her lower body kept coming to her and her walking became abnormal. Nian Bing turned her head and looked at Long Ling and said, \"Sheng, you are fine. It seems that you have not had a rest, looking at your appearance.\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling looked at him without any hesitation and said displeasedly, \"You are good at getting a bargain. It would be strange if I can sleep like that night. I want to take a shower first.\" The moisture from her lower body made her face look shy. She got off the bed, pinched Nianbing hard, and then rushed into the washing room. \n\n\n\nBlue Chen opened the door and poked out and looked outside, and couldn't help but shrink back. The people from the Langmu Empire Envoy had already gotten up and were sorting out the clothes. She couldn't help but feel a little anxious. How could she go out to see someone with such a thing? Looking back at Nian Bing, he saw that he was pushing his fingers there, not knowing what he was fucking, and couldn't help but ask, \"What's wrong with you?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said softly, \"I'm counting how many times we had last night. Well, it seems like five times, no, there was another one when I just took a shower, and it should be six times.\"\n\n\n\n\"You're going to die.\" Lan Chen didn't look at the twist of his lower body, walked to Nian Bing two steps, grabbed his ear with one hand, \"You little voice can't tell whoever you want to know?\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing burst into pain and said, \"You are a little bit lighter, good wife, can't you think I'm wrong? Fortunately, I have three wives, otherwise I will really be willing to treat you like this every night.\"\n\n\n\nBlue Chen gave him a blank look and said that he had no rebellion. After the battle for one night, his whole body was sore, but seeing how he was still so alive, he was alone. I am afraid he really couldn't satisfy his *****, \"Dang Nianbing, how did you let me see people like this! If my sister and mother saw it, I don't want to be human.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing held her pretty face and kissed her gently, and smiled and said, \"This is easy to solve! Since we can't leave, let's fly. If you fly directly to the car, who can see what can you see? It's so strange. Even if you are injured, I will use magic to heal people! Why don't you recover when walking?\" Looking at Blue Chen's unkind eyes, he didn't dare to continue talking about what happened behind. \n\n\n\nThe water flowed from the washing hands, and Long Ling had already started taking a shower. Lan Chen couldn't help but laugh and said, \"I was so upset last night. I'm afraid this girl was also excited.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing sat down with Lan Chen, letting her sit on her thigh, holding Feng Ying on her chest with one hand, putting her face on her pretty face, and whispered, \"Chen Chen.\"\n\n\n\nBlue Chen held Nianbing's big hand from outside and said unhappily: \"Fuck me.\"\"She was a little surprised. As soon as her body was touched by Nian Bing, she immediately felt it. I couldn't help but think in my heart, when did I become so sensitive, am I still the same Bingyun as before? In fact, she didn't know that Nian Bing had absorbed such a huge life energy because of a single card. Her life breath had reached its peak. The most primitive chapter of life was the desire of men and women. Since Nian Bing returned, the invisible scattered life breath in his body could naturally attract the attention of women around him. This was also one of the reasons why Mu Jing wanted to give him a hug. After Blue Chen merged with him, his life breath communicated with Nian Bing's life energy. Since Nian Bing's life magnetism was too big, it would have a great attraction to her life breath. This is why she and Nian Bing are connected *****. I'm not tired of having fun. Although her body is very tired now, Nian Bing's essence of life has been constantly changing her own life energy and her body.\n\n\n\nNian Bingbing held Blue Chen's little hand and said, \"I'm sorry, was I too anxious last night? Don't blame me for being so good? For more than a year, I really miss you too much. Last night I also wanted to control it, for fear of hurting you, but my love and honor for you in my heart made me unable to control it. That's why, I will be so careful next time and cherish you even more, okay?\"\n\n\n\nHearing Nian Bing’s mistake, Lan Chen couldn’t help but feel a little nervous. He slapped his neck, kissed him lightly, and said, “Okay, why would I blame you? Actually, why am I not like this?”\n\n\n\nThe sound of knocking on the door suddenly rose, and Lan Chen hurriedly got up from Nian Bing's legs. Nian Bing knew that she was inconvenient to walk, so she had to walk up and open the door with her head. But the person was not as he imagined. He was neither Yu Ruyu nor Fengniao, but his sister Mu Jing whom he just met last night. Mu Jing didn't feel surprised when she saw that Nian Bing was opening the door. She smiled lightly and said, \"Brother, we should leave.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing's face turned red and said, \"How did you know I'm here? Ling Er is taking a shower, and we will come out after she finishes taking a shower.\"\n\n\n\nMu Jing said in a low voice: \"It was Mrs. Feng who told me, brother, you are so good! You can do it with one arrow.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing looked at her in amazement. He didn't expect Mu Jing to say such a thing. He knew that it would be useless to explain what he was now, so he could only smile bitterly and said, \"Okay, you go first, we'll come out.\" Mu Jing smiled and said, \"Okay, we're waiting for you outside.\"\n\n\n\nOn the journey again and sitting on the horse, Nian Bing was once again examined by the Three Sessions, not because he touched the room between Lan Chen and Long Ling last night, but because of Mu Jing's voice. Nian Bing explained Mu Jing's life experience and thoughts to them. After finally helping to prick it out of the three daughters' doubts, it made him a little strange that Nian Bing knew, of course, that the young girl and Yu Ruyi lived next door. The next moans were getting louder and louder, and they had no reason not to hear it, but since the young girl didn't ask, he was happy and naturally he didn't know.With the help of Nian Bing's magic wind, Blue Chen flew directly on the horse, and sat on the horse for a whole day before he recovered. On the way, Mu Jing told Nianbing that she had sent someone to Fenglin City last night. On the grounds that Zamulun was injured, Tseilun came to meet them. According to the time calculation, she would meet them tomorrow morning at most. \n\n\n\nWhen night fell, because the whole day was running, the group did not find a place to stay, so they could only sleep in the wild. If the horse was sitting, it could accommodate eight people, but if it was sleeping, it could only accommodate four people. Nian Bing and Yang Feng naturally sent the horse to Yu Ruyi and Lan Chen three girls. The two and most of the people in the group kept warming by the bonfire. The temperature was getting lower and lower. Although this could not affect Nianbing and the rosy, the feeling of the cold wind was not very comfortable.\n\n\n\n\"Nianbing, I really admire you.\" The roe stuffed the last piece of meat into his mouth and said vaguely. Under the influence of Changsheng's sword, his figure looked a little more swaying than Nian Bing.\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Do you admire me when I was born in Yangon? Do you still admire me if I have three red confidants? In fact, with your character and strength, you will definitely find a girl who suits you.\" Zhang Feng snatched his head and said, \"No, I will never look for a human being. How can you human beings like us dwarves? What I mean by admiration is your affection and friendship. Do you know? I lived so much, and now I am the only one friend. Although I will still be sad about my mother's death, I have to admit that my mother's choice is right. Only by coming out can I know that I had seen so little in the past. During the time I went to Yangon with you, I learned more than I had learned in hundreds of years. I missed Bing, thank you.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing patted her shoulders and said, \"Let me think about it again. It's really hard for me to decide whether it will help you get lost and return to the world. This matter is so great.\"\n\n\n\nThe rosy smiled slightly and said, \"It's okay, you don't have to be difficult. I have decided on this matter, and it's also what I have to do, but you don't have this need. After all, you don't have to lose the big land.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing said, \"I'm actually very conflicted in my heart. Brother Wang, like you, I'm also very concerned about those gods and people. Regardless of the wrong thing, the selfishness and despicability I have seen has already made me unable to bear it. However, the Great Land of God is still sealed now, and we are here. The world is still in peace, and I don’t want to break this peace. If the loss of the capital, the impact on the Yangon mainland can be predicted. After many years, who knows what the loss of the capital has become? We still have some time, so let me think about it more.\"\n\n\n\nWhat did the rosy just say? Suddenly, a long man came from a distance, his voice was full of excitement and arrogant, and Nian Bing's face changed slightly, \"It's thirty miles away.\"\"The sound from thirty miles away could be heard so much. No need to ask, he already knew who the person was, but he didn't expect that he would come so quickly. He looked at the rosy and stood up at the same time.\n\n\n\nMu Jing jumped off her horse and stood ten feet away from Nian Bing and Evergreen to point them. Evergreen, Long Ling, Blue Chen and Yu Ruyi also got off the car one after another. Nian Bing and Evergreen flashed in front of them, Nian Bing said, \"This god will be dealt with by me and Evergreen. Mom, You are guarding the side. If that guy wants to escape, you must hold him down.\" Because he didn't know that the god named Xilun opened the three acupoints, Nian Bing had to make complete preparations. Otherwise, if Xilun opened the earthly acupoint, his intention to escape would be difficult.",

    "content": "Mu Jing ran in front of Nian Bing and said, \"Brother, let me help you.\" Nian Bing shook his head and said, \"No, if a thirteenth-order master counterattacks when they are dying, their power will be very strong. You stay here. Brother Xi Lu, let's go meet them.\" As he spoke, he and Xi Lu leaped up simultaneously, disappearing from everyone's sight within two movements. Yu Ruyan nodded to Lan Chen and the other two girls. Four colored lights, two blue and two red, simultaneously appeared on them and went in four directions. When Mu Jing and his entourage could no longer see their figures, except for Long Ling, Yu Ruyan and the others released their Royal Feathers. Yu Ruyan flew north, Feng Nu and Lan Chen flew to the east and west respectively, and Long Ling remained in the south, closest to the entourage. Nian Bing's intentions were clear: this was a killing formation.\n\nArriving at a wide-open flat area, Nian Bing and Xi Lu stopped. Yellow light flashed, and the Longevity Blade detached from Xi Lu, returning to Nian Bing's hand. Seven-colored light was released from Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye acupoint, and his mental energy spread out in a fan shape towards the north. Soon, he clearly sensed someone approaching him at an astonishing speed. This time, Nian Bing decided to use a different method to deal with this god-person. Seven-colored lights flashed simultaneously, and seven Shadow Puppets, led by Hei Wu Huang, appeared, carrying seven divine blades and hiding in the dark night sky.\n\nUnder his mental perception, the person was getting closer and closer. Nian Bing nodded to Xi Lu. Xi Lu's God Slaying Axe was already in his hand. Because he was wearing the black Dwarf God Armor, he was not conspicuous at night. Black fighting energy flickered around his body, and the entire person slowly sank into the ground. For a time, only Nian Bing remained in the surrounding emptiness.\n\nThe fiery red light was particularly striking at night, bouncing along the ground like a meteor. From the moment Nian Bing spotted him until he reached Nian Bing, it only took a few breaths.\n\nHis mental energy retracted. Seven-colored light emanated from Nian Bing's body simultaneously, immediately attracting the attention of the fiery red figure. With a soft exclamation, the fiery red figure stopped thirty zhang away from Nian Bing. Although it was night and the person was covered in fiery red fighting energy, Nian Bing could still see his appearance through his open eyes. The person was wearing dark red armor. The armor looked very ostentatious. The two large chest plates were cast from an unknown red gemstone, and the shoulder guards were extremely wide, extending a foot out from both sides of the shoulders. The abdominal armor below the chest armor was shaped like fish scales, clearly designed not to impede flexibility. This set of dark red armor was inlaid with a diamond-shaped gemstone. This gemstone was also red, but it appeared much more crystalline than the two large red gemstones on the chest plates. The entire set of armor looked like burning high-temperature flames. Although Nian Bing didn't know much about armor, he could tell that this armor was extraordinary and couldn't help but secretly admire, \"There are indeed many ores on the Continent of Gods! I wonder how this armor was forged.\"\n\nJust then, Xi Lu's somewhat anxious voice sounded in Nian Bing's ears. \"Brother, we must obtain this armor. This is one of the twelve divine artifacts forged by our dwarf race, called the Fire Cloud Armor. Not only is its defense extremely strong, but it also greatly enhances fire-attribute fighting energy. Its greatest feature is its scalability. With a little modification, it can adapt to people of any body shape.\"\n\nNian Bing did not answer Xi Lu. His gaze shifted from the armor of the approaching person to his face. He looked about thirty years old, with a long face and small eyes narrowed into slits. He was also sizing Nian Bing up. The most distinctive feature was his aquiline nose, with the nasal bone protruding forward, giving him a very sinister and gloomy aura.\n\n\"Who are you? Did Mu Jing send you to greet me? Why haven't I seen you before?\" the person asked, his eyes showing a hint of confusion as he looked at Nian Bing. Hearing his question, Nian Bing knew he had found the right person. He smiled calmly and said, \"You may not know me, but I know you. You should be called Xilun, right?\"\n\n\"How dare you!\" Xilun coldly snorted, and the surrounding temperature noticeably increased a few degrees. \"To dare to address my nation's Master by name is enough to get you killed ten times over. Are you Mu Jing's subordinate?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"Of course not. However, I am indeed waiting for you here. Let alone you, even the Main Gods of your Continent of Gods wouldn't dare to be so presumptuous when they see me.\" The seven-colored radiance instantly turned golden, and immense pressure permeated the open space. In his surprise, Xilun immediately took a step back, his expression changing slightly. \"Huang Ji acupoint.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"You still have some knowledge. Your good brother Zamu Lun has already gone to hell to wait for you. Now, you can go with him.\" The pressure instantly intensified, and seven figures simultaneously lit up around Xilun. Seven divine blades, carrying condensed seven-elemental energy, attacked Xilun from different directions.\n\nDozens of dark red palm shadows exploded around Xilun. The dark red aura seemed to set the air ablaze, creating ripples like water. The seven Shadow Puppets retreated after one strike, not making contact with the dark red palm shadows. As the palm shadows began to dissipate, the seven figures rushed forward again, the sharp aura carried by the seven-colored light directed at Xilun's vital points as if it were tangible.\n\nXilun coldly snorted and waved his hands around his body, creating a dense barrier. If it were just the seven Shadow Puppets, only Hei Wu Huang could pose some threat to him. Otherwise, even without defending, the other Shadow Puppets could not break through his protective fighting energy. However, the seven divine blades in the hands of the seven Shadow Puppets forced him to defend himself. As a god-person who had lived for thousands of years, he naturally recognized the power of the seven divine blades and cherished the Fire Cloud Armor on his body immensely, fearing that the armor might be damaged by these divine blades. Among the Shadow Puppets, only Hei Wu Huang could unleash an attack power exceeding the twelfth order, while the other six Shadow Puppets, even with the divine blades, could at most reach the tenth order in attack power. Facing the thirteenth-order Xilun, they were locked in a fierce battle for a time.\n\nNian Bing had communicated with Hei Wu Huang before. In the Lake of Death, the abundant death energy had completely revived Hei Wu Huang's soul. However, due to the loss of his physical body, it was difficult for him to recover to his peak state. Therefore, he could only maintain a twelfth-order attack power. Hei Wu Huang had also told him that he was practicing a special cultivation technique suitable for energy bodies. Under the effect of the Demon Devouring Blade, it would take some time to break through. At this moment, facing a powerful enemy, Hei Wu Huang's fighting spirit grew stronger. Each attack of the Demon Devouring Blade drew a lot of Xilun's energy.\n\nXilun himself was at the thirteenth-order, and with the amplification of the Fire Cloud Armor, although he couldn't compare to a Main God, he was also one of the reserve Main Gods on the Continent of Gods. His strength was not inferior to the Wind God who had defeated the Sacred Master back then. This time, he came to the仰光 Continent as one of the three leaders. Nian Bing had not expected this. Although the joint attack of the seven Shadow Puppets was formidable, it was difficult to injure him. If it weren't for his greater apprehension of Nian Bing's presence and the fact that he could only exert ninety percent of his strength under the pressure released by Nian Bing, the Shadow Puppets would have been unable to stop him long ago.\n\nNian Bing's mental energy was completely connected with his Shadow Puppets. Through their attacks, the Heavenly Eye acupoint quickly analyzed Xilun's strength. It was obvious that Xilun was not using his full strength. His strength was clearly much greater than that of Zamu Lun. Although Zamu Lun was close to thirteenth-order+, he had not truly reached the thirteenth-order. Even Xi Lu, in a one-on-one situation, could destroy him at the cost of injury. But the current Xilun was clearly much stronger. Not to mention the Fire Cloud Armor he wore, just the solidified fighting energy he condensed with each palm strike amazed Nian Bing. This was because, although his fighting energy was used for attack, the loss was very small. Without making contact with the Shadow Puppets, he could even retract it into his body, minimizing consumption. Now, Nian Bing could almost conclude that this god-person in front of him had definitely opened the Li Zhong acupoint, and at least reached the mid-stage.\n\nWith these judgments, the golden light emanating from Nian Bing's entire body suddenly retracted. A seven-colored light condensed at the center of his brow and shot out in a straight line towards Xilun's position. Xilun was startled and was about to make a move when he saw that seven-colored light instantly spread out, forming a huge light shield that enveloped a hundred zhang radius around him. The sense of relief he had just felt after the pressure disappeared instantly intensified. His fire fighting energy weakened a few degrees in an instant, and the speed of the seven Shadow Puppets that had been缠着 (entangling) him increased sharply, their speed doubling. The divine blades in the seven divine swords also became brighter. This immediately put Xilun in a difficult situation. He couldn't help but exclaim inwardly, \"Domain Shift, Heavenly Eye acupoint.\" A sense of horror filled his heart, and his hands involuntarily weakened. Hei Wu Huang's Demon Devouring Blade slashed through the defense outside his armor, leaving a shallow mark on the Fire Cloud Armor. Xilun naturally understood what the Huang Ji and Heavenly Eye acupoints represented. The anger in his heart instantly subsided. His eyes flashed, and with a wave of his right hand, a long saber burning with flames instantly appeared in his palm. He swung it around his body, and dark red light instantly forced back the seven enhanced Shadow Puppets. He gripped the saber with both hands and slashed towards the Shadow Puppets.\n\nHei Wu Huang's combat experience was certainly no less than Xilun's. Regardless of whether it was in the past or now, he never retreated from an enemy. The Demon Devouring Blade radiated dark light and bravely met Xilun's attack.\n\nThe collision of fighting energy produced a sharp whistling sound. Hei Wu Huang grunted, and his body, along with the Demon Devouring Blade, was sent flying out ten zhang. His once tangible body instantly became somewhat ethereal. But Xilun was also not in a good state. Because he was fully attacking Hei Wu Huang, his body was slashed by the other six divine blades. His protective fighting energy could only weaken sixty percent of the attack. With six divine blades striking him, a layer of milky white radiance emanated from his body. The radiance flashed and repelled the six Shadow Puppets, but he himself staggered. The six different magic elements, intertwined with each other, invaded his body. If it weren't for the Fire Cloud Armor filtering most of the attack, this blow alone would have been enough to injure him. However, the six invading magic elements, combined with the dark element that had infiltrated from the previous blow by the Shadow Puppet, also placed a great burden on him. For a time, Xilun had to concentrate all his fighting energy to resist these magic elements, trying to force them out of his body.\n\nNian Bing let out a long roar towards the sky and shouted, \"Oscar.\" His slender body leaped high into the air. A clear dragon roar resounded, and gray light spots condensed below Nian Bing. When his body reached its highest point, the gray light spots condensed in the air instantly took shape. A gray giant dragon, seven zhang long, appeared, carrying Nian Bing into the high sky. The gray giant dragon exuded a layer of golden luster. As it roared, its gray scales flared open.\n\nThe gray giant dragon's body was generally similar to ordinary dragons, but on its head, there was only a single horn, half a zhang long, which was dark gold. Where Nian Bing was, his body seemed to be connected to the giant dragon, his clothes disappeared, and his skin grew a layer of gray scales similar to the dragon's, as if he were part of the dragon itself. Seven-element magic rained down like hail, with only one target: Xilun. A strange scene occurred. Those magic spells, which were clearly only at the sixth or seventh order, immediately increased by one level after entering the seven-colored light shield. Due to their sheer number, they caught Xilun off guard. Although these magic elements did not directly harm his body, they established a connection with the magic elements that had invaded his body. It seemed to be a connection from innate energy, guiding the seven magic elements that were about to be expelled to rage wildly within his body.\n\nXilun exclaimed in shock, \"Dragon Mage!\" His fear grew. He waved his flame saber into countless afterimages, dissolving the descending magic. Recalling Nian Bing's words that Zamu Lun had gone to hell, Xilun no longer intended to fight, as what could be more important than his own life?\n\nJust as Xilun was facing both the magic falling from the sky and the magic elements within his body, a dark shadow silently leaped from behind him. Where he leaped, the soil vanished. The black fighting energy became the best cover in the silent night. When Xilun sensed the crisis behind him, the huge black battle axe was already only one zhang away from his body.",

    "content": "In the midst of crisis, Xilun displayed the combat experience accumulated over thousands of years. A halo of red light erupted from within him, instantly disintegrating the barrage of magic falling from the sky. The flame blade in his hand slashed in an arc from the left, repelling the seven shadow puppets that were closing in. As the flame blade swept from left to right towards his chest, he channeled the power of his waist and back into the long blade, his strength reaching its peak. He then slammed it into Xilu's battle axe, no longer able to restrain the magic elements erupting from within him.\n\nIn the air, Oscar, following Nianbing's warning, flapped his wings and soared high. Immediately after, a white bright spot appeared and expanded rapidly. A deafening roar, accompanied by shockwaves and countless flying clods of earth, spread to every corner within a radius of fifty feet in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe blinding white light was actually sparks generated by the collision. If Nianbing hadn't possessed his Heavenly Eye, he would have likely lost his sight temporarily due to this white light. The surging brilliance flashed, and the violent energy fluctuations from below made him feel as if he had returned to the Divine Continent.\n\nXilu's body was sent flying back at an even faster speed than when he arrived. However, how could an attack from someone with his nearly thirteenth-tier strength, combined with the divine artifact, the God-Slaying Axe, be weak? The moment Nianbing's seven shadow puppets received his mental command, they had already transformed into seven streaks of light and disappeared into the air. This was thanks to the spatial shadow puppet's ability to instantly transport the seven light figures and their seven divine blades into mid-air, thus avoiding being caught in the crossfire.\n\nWhen Xilu's body landed on the ground, he had lost control. Wrapped in a much dimmer black light, his body was dragged for a full thirty feet on the ground. The Dwarf God Armor played a crucial role at this moment, protecting his already formidable body from external injuries. Yet, as Xilu's body finally came to a halt at the end of the gully, he opened his mouth and spat out a sky full of blood mist.\n\nCompared to Xilu, Xilun was in an even worse state. The flame long blade he was using was not condensed from battle qi, but rather a special mineral capable of releasing intense flames. At this moment, his prized flame long blade had shattered into countless small fragments, scattered far away, emitting tiny flames. Xilun's body had shrunk by at least half, with his lower body completely buried in the ground. Centered on him, the surrounding soil had turned into scorched earth. Cracks, radiating outwards from the ground three feet deep, stretched into the distance. Blood flowed from his mouth in streams. The Fire Cloud Armor, as expected of divine artifacts crafted by the dwarf race, showed no damage on its surface. However, if even the divine artifact like the Dwarf God Armor could not completely neutralize the shockwaves generated by the energy collision, how could the Fire Cloud Armor be spared?\n\nUnder Xilu's furious full-power attack, Xilun's headband had flown dozens of feet away. His long, black hair cascaded onto his shoulders like a ghost. His originally bronze face had turned pale. Upon closer inspection, blood not only gushed from his mouth but also leaked from all seven of his orifices. His right hand could barely be lifted, and his chest heaved continuously as if he were gasping for breath. Malicious glints flickered in his narrow, small eyes, but anyone could see it was mere bravado. His internal organs had suffered severe injuries, and a faint seven-colored light kept emanating from his pale face. He couldn't even expel the seven types of magic elements within his body, which were instead manifesting through his skin, indicating his dire condition.\n\nNianbing, riding Oscar, floated in mid-air without moving. He knew how fortunate that previous attack had been. If he hadn't first attracted Master Xilun's attention and then wounded him using the Heavenly Eye domain in conjunction with the shadow puppets, Xilu's attack might not have produced such an effect. Thirteen-tier divine beings were indeed powerful, let alone divine beings who had activated the Xijing, Fangjia, and Lixhong acupoints.\n\nThe moment Nianbing saw the milky white light emanating from Xilun, he had already determined which acupoints he had activated. The milky white defensive energy clearly came from the Fangjia acupoint, and the Fangjia acupoint required the Xijing acupoint to be activated first. Nianbing hadn't expected that, under the effect of his Heavenly Eye domain, which had almost severed Xilun's connection with the external innate qi, his Fangjia acupoint could still exert such powerful defensive effects. Furthermore, his Lixhong acupoint, used for condensing energy, could no longer hold back any reserves due to Xilu's combined attack. Nianbing was now focusing on the faint red light flickering on Xilun's body. As a peak thirteen-tier powerhouse, Xilun was far beyond Zamulun's capabilities. Nianbing had a premonition that Xilun would not be easily defeated. Therefore, he was waiting, waiting for Xilun's transformation to appear, and also waiting for Xilu to recover. In terms of attack intensity, Nianbing knew he couldn't compare to Xilu. Without Xilu's offensive power, relying solely on his own strength, even if he could restrain Xilun, he wouldn't be able to inflict a fatal blow.\n\nOscar let out a low growl, golden-gray airflow swirling around his body. His current body was entirely condensed from energy. When Oscar's Dragon God Heart Art finally broke through to the fifth level, he had been able to achieve this. With energy as his body, supplemented by his soul, although he wasn't a true dragon yet, his strength was definitely not inferior to ordinary dragons. Moreover, he had the unique advantage of possessing the energy attribute of void.\n\nXilu staggered to his feet from the gully, a hint of admiration in his eyes. Xilun's strength impressed him, and he wished his ancestors had suffered a great loss at the hands of divine beings. A single divine-level expert like this made it difficult for him to cope, even with his two divine artifacts. If there were another opponent of similar strength, he and Nianbing would likely have to flee before even thinking of destroying their opponent. A two-on-one situation was not exactly glorious, but for the sake of his aspirations and his ancestors, he had no choice but to make this decision.\n\nXilun's gasping gradually became lighter. His gaze fixed on Xilu, the light of the Fire Cloud Armor had dimmed considerably. After all, even the strongest divine artifact required the owner's own strength to activate. \"Dwarf, I didn't expect to see a dwarf here,\" his somewhat sharp voice sounded exceptionally calm, not at all like his disheveled appearance.\n\nXilu snorted coldly and took firm steps, walking towards Xilun. \"Our dwarf race will always live for the pursuit of our beliefs. If you divine beings can come to this beautiful continent, why can't we dwarves? Xilun, accept your fate. At least three-tenths of your meridians have been shattered by my battle qi. You have no chance.\"\n\nXilun smiled eerily and looked up at Nianbing in the sky. \"Indeed, this is an excellent trap. For a Wood Crystal, I now believe that Zamulun has indeed died at your hands. Unfortunately, I am not him. Do you think that with three-tenths of my meridians broken, I am not guaranteed to die? Then you underestimate us divine beings.\" As he spoke, he suddenly struck out with his hand, not towards Xilu, nor to deal with Nianbing in the air, but with a ball of dark red light, directly striking his own lower abdomen.\n\nNianbing had flown into the air because he had made an accurate judgment of the situation. Martial artists like Xilun and Xilu weren't incapable of flying. However, using battle qi to fly consumed a significant amount of vital energy, so martial artists would not do so lightly unless absolutely necessary. While mages' flight speed using magic couldn't compare to martial artists, Nianbing was not just a mage. As Xilun had exclaimed earlier, when Oscar awakened, he had already become a Dragon Mage. No matter how fast a person flew using battle qi, they couldn't compare to the ruler of the skies, the flying dragon. Therefore, as Nianbing sat on Oscar's back and ascended into the high altitude, he had already placed himself in an invincible position.\n\nThe red light flashed instantly, and Nianbing's heart tightened. He finally understood what Xilun intended to do. The spot he had struck was the Xijing acupoint, one of the seven major acupoints in the human body. The red flames reignited, but this time, a touch of golden brilliance was added to the red. The flames burned more fiercely than before, and the range covered by the battle qi suddenly doubled. The entire Fire Cloud Armor now shone with a transparency akin to precious gems. Not only Xilu on the ground, but even Nianbing in the air was illuminated by the sun-like radiance.\n\n\"Brother Xilu, be careful! This guy has gone mad! He's destroying his Xijing acupoint.\" Destroying an acupoint, also known as acupoint detonation, causes irreparable damage to the human body. Not only will vital energy leak out through the damaged acupoint, but once an acupoint is damaged, it can never heal. An acupoint detonation will prevent any other acupoints from being activated. In severe cases, it can even lead to death. However, acupoint detonation can also bring immense benefits, just like Nianbing's method of cursing life. It is a method of drinking poison to quench thirst, but the effect is enormous.\n\nBy sacrificing one's vital energy and using one's own body as the foundation, detonating an acupoint that has already been activated to the intermediate or advanced stage can instantly grant twice the power of that acupoint's ultimate state. This means that with Xilun's Xijing acupoint detonated, he would gain twice the capability of the Xijing acupoint at its ultimate stage. Although this state would not last long, the power it brought was absolutely destructive.\n\nXilu, who had been advancing, stopped. However, the fighting intent in his eyes did not diminish in the slightest. He slowly raised his hands, gripping the God-Slaying Axe. Small golden characters appeared on the black axe: \"Babaturilu.\" A strange incantation resounded from his mouth, and Xilu's body began to change. His originally sturdy physique suddenly expanded by a circumference, and his height increased by a head. The short-handled black battle axe transformed into a giant battle axe three feet long in the intense black light. The axe handle was as thick as an arm, and the axe head was as wide as a door panel. The black axe blade shimmered with a faint blue luster. Xilu's eyes instantly turned white, and black airflow swirled rapidly around his body like a vortex.\n\nXilun seemed oblivious to the changes happening to Xilu. The pain from the sudden destruction of his Xijing acupoint caused dozens of blood vessels on his body to burst. Immense innate qi surged madly from the surroundings. Nianbing's previously deployed Heavenly Eye domain had vanished during the last collision between Xilun and Xilu. Even if the Heavenly Eye domain still existed, it would be impossible to stop such a frenzied innate qi.\n\nNianbing let out a cold snort. The seven divine blades reappeared, but this time, they were not accompanied by the seven shadow puppets. Due to the previous energy burst, the souls of the seven divine blades had suffered some damage. Nianbing now had to rely on himself alone. Xilun's madness and Xilu's mutation stimulated Nianbing, igniting surging battle intent within him. The seven types of magic elements in the air continuously gathered around his body under the effect of the seven divine blades, and the seven-colored light gradually intensified. Nianbing extended his hands, grabbing the Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess—Dew Blade—and the Roar of the Fire God—Sunlight Blade. The two blades, held before him, swiftly drew a triangle, and a six-pointed ice and fire star immediately appeared before him. The remaining five divine blades began to revolve around Nianbing's body. A soft green light emanated from his chest. His azure blue eyes instantly turned golden, and Nianbing's body fully entered combat mode.\n\nThe power of a divine being, a dwarf, and an ordinary human was increasing madly. Under the effect of the torrential energy, the cracks in the earth expanded, and deep gullies gradually appeared. The ground seemed to tremble, and all the surrounding energy surged.\n\nFiery red light continuously rose around Xilun's body. He floated in mid-air, enveloped in the fiery red light. The messy black hair on his head vanished into thin smoke. His right hand remained at his lower abdomen, where the Fire Cloud Armor was emitting a red light brighter than the gems on his headband. His fire-attribute battle qi remained at the thirteenth tier, but the fire elements in the air, under the influence of innate qi, formed a dazzling halo around his body. At the cost of detonating his acupoint, he had obtained the voice he desired. The Fire Cloud Armor creaked, seemingly on the verge of bursting under the strain of Xilun's expanding muscles. The nearly transparent armor, stimulated by the surging fire elements, unleashed its power beyond anything before.\n\n\"Blaspheming against the gods will only result in destruction,\" Xilun's voice became exceptionally somber. He stared coldly at Xilu before him, his hands clasped at his chest. Golden-red flames rose from his hands, and a long blade entirely condensed from flames appeared before him. With a slight wave of the long blade, the soil on the ground turned into smoke, leaving a bottomless scar.",

    "content": "At this moment,\n\nNian Bing had a strange thought arise within him.\n\nXi Lun, at the cost of damaging his West Quadrant acupoint, had gained immense innate energy.\n\nHis innate cultivation ability was fire attribute.\n\nTherefore, his battle qi could now attract vast fire essence with the effect of innate energy.\n\nLooking at the heat emanating from his blade,\n\nit should have far surpassed the realm of Heavenly Fire.\n\nThat,\n\nthis golden-red fire,\n\nhow would it compare to the Phoenix True Fire that might be encountered at the upcoming ceremony of the Phoenix Clan?\n\nXi Lu stirred.\n\nHis abilities had been elevated to the extreme within that simple, wordless incantation.\n\nAs a divine artifact, the Dwarf God Armor\n\nwas clearly superior to the Fire Cloud Armor.\n\nAlthough his body had expanded considerably,\n\nthe Dwarf God Armor had also grown with his body.\n\nIt still completely covered him.\n\nRaising the massive battle-axe high,\n\nXi Lu stomped his feet on the ground with great force.\n\nA pit with a diameter of ten zhang and a depth of ten zhang appeared.\n\nAnd his body was propelled into the sky like a cannonball. The battle-axe swung in the air,\n\nthe black axe face carrying a fifteen-zhang long beam of battle qi that streaked across the sky.\n\nThe faintly glowing axe blade,\n\na beam of light formed a light beam.\n\nThis,\n\nwas composed of countless overlapping light rays.\n\nWhen Xi Lu's body reached its highest point in the sky,\n\nNian Bing heard three words from his mouth:\n\n\"Slaughter--God--Slash.\"\n\nThe moment Xi Lu leaped into the air, Xi Lun also moved.\n\nHis body trailed a flame-like illusion.\n\nSuddenly rising,\n\nleaving a brilliant golden-red flame in the sky, it suddenly met Xi Lu's attack from below.\n\nOpportunity always favors the prepared.\n\nNian Bing would naturally not let slip the current opportunity. It wasn't that he didn't trust Xi Lu's strength, but\n\nhe did not like his honest elder brother to suffer any harm. The Ice Snow Goddess's...\n\nAlmost the instant Xi Lun ascended,\n\nit appeared on his unavoidable path. Instant Forbidden Spell.\n\nNian Bing's golden eyes\n\nfully condensed his mental power.\n\nIn a short period,\n\nregardless of the seven divine artifacts' actions.\n\nFive forbidden spells were instantly condensed again,\n\nbelonging to the Earth, Wind, Space, Dark, and Light elements. The energy required for these five forbidden spells was so immense,\n\nespecially the last two, Light and Dark. As Xi Lun passed through the preceding forbidden spells, they collided with each other.\n\nThe released energy multiplied geometrically.\n\nThis attack\n\nhad reached the level of a twelfth-tier Divine Descent Technique.\n\nOr,\n\nthis explosion of the two poles, Light and Dark, surpassed the twelfth-tier. This was also one of Nian Bing's strongest magic at his current stage. If it weren't for Xi Lun's fire energy being too vast, Nian Bing would have definitely chosen the forbidden spell fusion of Ice and Fire as One.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe fire element Xi Lun obtained after damaging his West Quadrant acupoint was too massive.\n\nSo massive that Nian Bing couldn't absorb enough with the True Yang Blade to produce the forbidden spells.\n\nTherefore, there were only six forbidden spells in total.\n\nIf Xi Lun were the Xi Lun from the beginning,\n\nthese six consecutive forbidden spells might not have been able to destroy him,\n\nbut they might have been able to severely injure him. However, after exploding his acupoints, he had become perversely strong. Even he himself didn't know how strong he truly was. But the six consecutive forbidden spells only slowed him down slightly, and the golden-red light around his body dimmed a bit, but it did not stop his momentum as he charged into the sky.\n\nXi Lu's Slaughter God Slash arrived. Both Nian Bing and Xi Lu believed this would be a fatal blow to Xi Lun. Even if Xi Lun's strength after exploding his acupoints was even greater, he couldn't possibly withstand six forbidden spells and then contend with Xi Lu's mutated fatal strike. However, facts often differ from imagination.\n\nJust as Xi Lu's battle-axe was about to strike Xi Lun, Xi Lun suddenly changed. A silver crystal suddenly appeared before him, meeting Xi Lu's battle-axe. The crystal shattered almost instantly. In this very moment, Xi Lun, who had been unstoppable moments ago, suddenly disappeared. When the golden-red light reappeared, he was already five hundred zhang away.\n\nXi Lu's full-power strike could not possibly be withdrawn. When he executed this strike, he had not only locked onto Xi Lun but also held nothing back. The moment Xi Lun disappeared, he sensed something was wrong, but his Slaughter God Slash still went down without reservation.\n\nNian Bing also did not stop. The moment he realized Xi Lun had disappeared, his intent had connected with Oscar beneath him. Xi Lun absolutely could not be allowed to escape. If he escaped, it would inevitably attract other divine beings, and possibly even lead to divine beings harboring hatred and seeking revenge against humans. Therefore, he must die. Oscar flapped his wings forcefully. His body, carrying Nian Bing, shot out like a phantom, directly pursuing Xi Lun. And at this very moment, the Slaughter God Slash reached the ground.\n\nNian Bing, who was urgently pursuing Xi Lun, found it strange. With Xi Lu's immense energy, the sound of impact on the ground should have been unimaginable, yet even after he had chased out a thousand zhang and was closing the distance with Xi Lun, he still hadn't heard any roar from behind. At this moment, he couldn't afford to think too much; killing Xi Lun was the top priority.\n\nThe one guarding Xi Lun's escape direction was Lan Chen. The earlier confrontation among the three had been clearly heard and the immense energy fluctuations felt by every woman guarding the four corners. They were all very nervous because, judging by the energy intensity, they understood that the opponent Nian Bing had encountered this time was not easy to deal with.\n\nGently patting the Ice Phoenix Feathers on her back, Bing Yun floated there, waiting quietly, holding the Ice Snow Staff that the Ice Snow Goddess had bestowed upon her. When she saw a golden-red dot in the distance approaching her direction at an imperceptible speed, she cast the incantation without hesitation, and at the same time activated her Ice Snow Goddess Domain.\n\nThe previously calm night sky instantly transformed into a world of ice and snow. With Nian Bing having opened the Heavenly Eye acupoint, coupled with over a year of diligent cultivation, Bing Yun's Ice Snow Goddess Domain had entered a mature state. The domain was released instantly, far stronger than when she had dealt with Nian Bing. The covered area was more than a hundred times larger than before. Large snowflakes fell from the sky, and the biting cold wind, carrying large amounts of snow, swirled continuously. The cold feeling was very comfortable for Bing Yun. Due to her preparedness, her long-prepared magic was soon completed: among the forbidden spells of ice magic, the easiest to control and most powerful was naturally the Ice Snow Goddess Dragon, which had appeared in the hands of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess and Nian Bing. This magic could be said to be the most cost-effective among ice magic. Therefore, after ice mages reached the Archmage realm, they would inevitably choose this magic when using forbidden spells.\n\nThe golden-red light spot continued to expand. Through the Heavenly Eye acupoint, Bing Yun could clearly see the appearance of the person coming. At the same time, she could also clearly see Nian Bing riding Oscar in pursuit behind the golden-red light, rapidly approaching the golden-red silhouette. Bing Yun did not underestimate Xi Lun at all. How could she be sure of resisting such a powerful being that even Nian Bing and Xi Lu combined couldn't retain? She thought very clearly; what she needed to do was to delay this person’s arrival, just holding on for a few breaths until Nian Bing caught up would be enough. Therefore, she used one of her most proficient ice magic: the Ice Snow Goddess Dragon. Under the effect of the Ice Snow Goddess Domain, the Ice Snow Goddess Dragon's power was greatly enhanced. The icy, snowy landscape was filled with large snowflakes, concealing the Ice Snow Goddess Dragon that was already roaring lowly.\n\nIt could also be considered Xi Lun's bad luck. If he had chosen any of the other three directions, he wouldn't have encountered such strong resistance. The Dragon Spirit's magic was still relatively weak, and it didn't have its own innate domain. Even ice magic that could restrain fire wouldn't pose much of a threat to Xi Lun. As for Yu Ruyan and Feng Nu, who were of the same fire element, though powerful, after Xi Lun destroyed his West Quadrant acupoint, if he encountered them, not only would it be difficult to stop Xi Lun, but he would likely absorb a lot of fire energy to replenish himself. Unfortunately, Xi Lun chose the West, the direction guarded by Bing Yun, and what greeted him was the Ice Snow Goddess Dragon rising from within the Ice Snow Goddess Domain.\n\nXi Lun's situation at this moment was far from glorious. Although he appeared extremely powerful, breaking through Nian Bing's fully released six forbidden spells, only he knew that the fire elements he had painstakingly absorbed around his body had been consumed by more than half after resisting those six forbidden spells. His body had already been severely wounded by Xi Lu's previous attack. Although he had greatly increased his strength at the cost of destroying his West Quadrant acupoint, his own consumption had also increased exponentially. Every second, his internal vital energy would flow away faster, and his injuries would worsen. Moreover, he had not fully dodged Xi Lu's Slaughter God Slash at that time. As one of Xi Lu's strongest attacks, although the Slaughter God Slash was diverted using a precious spatial teleportation crystal, the destructive power generated in an instant had caused him immense trauma. His entire left arm was shattered inch by inch, and even the outer Fire Cloud Armor had turned into fragments. It was only by relying on the condensation of the fire elements around his body that he managed to prevent losing this arm. When he felt the coldness ahead cause the battle qi around his body to fluctuate violently, he couldn't help but feel despair. He never expected that with the combined strength of Nian Bing and Xi Lu, there would still be an ambush. If the ambush's strength was equally formidable, he would have no chance at all.\n\nWhen facing a life-threatening crisis, Xi Lun had no other choice. For survival, he could only make a final struggle.\n\nA fiery red light wheel rapidly expanded outwards from Xi Lun's body. With every expansion, Bing Yun's Ice Snow Goddess Domain would shrink. The surrounding cold was dispelled by the heat, and the energy obtained from exploding the West Quadrant acupoint was released by Xi Lun without reservation at this moment.\n\nLan Chen floated in mid-air, her wings gently flapping behind her. She wasn't flustered at all. Since the opponent could break through the attacks of Nian Bing and Xi Lu, his strength couldn't be that weak. From the very beginning, she hadn't expected to be stronger than the approaching person. Therefore, the instant Xi Lun came into contact with her Ice Snow Goddess Domain, the surrounding snowflakes instantly mixed with a large number of ice shards and flew upwards. Various ever-changing ice and snow scenes appeared before Xi Lun. Although these illusions couldn't cause him harm or confusion, they did effectively slow down his advance. At this time, Nian Bing was still three hundred zhang away from Xi Lun, and the Death God Scythe, a dark forbidden spell released by Nian Bing, had already silently appeared behind him.\n\nAttacked from both front and back, at least on the surface, Xi Lun was completely on the defensive. Regardless of who it was, when choosing to explode an acupoint, there would only be one chance in their lifetime. Once an acupoint was exploded, further cultivation would be difficult to advance, and other acupoints could no longer be exploded. Xi Lun's choice to explode the West Quadrant acupoint was naturally intentional. If he had chosen the Li Zhong acupoint, then even if he escaped, his strength would likely not even be thirty percent. Although the outcome of exploding the West Quadrant acupoint would only allow him to recover to at most fifty percent, the effect of the West Quadrant acupoint in condensing innate energy could allow his strength to expand to its maximum instantly.\n\nA sharp, piercing howl came from Xi Lun's mouth. His body instantly accelerated. The milky white radiance behind him ascended to its limit. Supported by the vast innate energy obtained from exploding the West Quadrant acupoint, although his body was already severely injured, the Fang Jia acupoint associated with the West Quadrant acupoint erupted with ultimate defensive power. The Death God Scythe clashed head-on with the milky white radiance without any fancy moves, but the result was merely to increase Xi Lun's forward momentum by a few points. The black airflow disintegrated almost instantly, and the massive Death God figure also disappeared simultaneously. Xi Lun's charging body also trembled violently. The true ultimate Fang Jia acupoint naturally couldn't be harmed by an eleventh-tier forbidden spell. However, Xi Lun's internal energy was rapidly draining. With his vital energy greatly depleted, his Fang Jia acupoint could only protect his body this one time.\n\nWhen Bing Yun first started learning magic with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had taught her that when casting magic, she must find the best timing, only then could the magic achieve the best effect. Bing Yun had never forgotten her master's guidance. Therefore, the moment Xi Lun's Fang Jia acupoint clashed with the Death God Scythe cast by Nian Bing, the Ice Snow Goddess Dragon, hidden within the Ice Snow Goddess Domain, appeared.",

    "content": "A clear dragon roar, accompanied by an icy breath, instantly enveloped Xilun's body. In the fierce impact, Xilun let out a mouthful of blood, but the moment he was blocked by the Ice Snow Goddess's domain, he had been cautiously observing. And the Ice Snow Goddess's dragon appeared when he was at his weakest, Xilun's eyes turned red. For the last shred of life, he chose to fight desperately.\n\nThe fire-red light scattered around his body instantly condensed into a giant flame blade, five zhang long. Xilun's body had no defense at this moment. The innate energy from the Xijing acupoint instantly condensed. He swung the flame blade in his hand without any hesitation. To avoid being injured again by the qi manipulation, the flame blade, swung with all his might, flew out of his hand.\n\nAs Nian Bing flew rapidly and saw Xilun fighting desperately, his heart was instantly in great anxiety. At this moment, Oscar's gray breath was still a hundred zhang away from Xilun's body, and time was clearly running out. He could only hope that Lan Chen's strength was enough to support him until he arrived.\n\nHidden within the Ice Snow Goddess's domain, the ice and snow not only did not obstruct Lan Chen but became her eyes. Through the sensation of ice and snow, she could clearly perceive everything around her. The moment the flame blade appeared, Bingyun understood that it was something her released Ice Snow Goddess's dragon could not block, so she made a change with the utmost speed.\n\n\"Phoenix—Shadow—Three—Divisions.\" Bingyun's originally solidified body suddenly underwent a change, both the wings on her back and her body. At this moment, they became illusory, and three figures appeared simultaneously. Her blue eyes instantly turned golden, and the blue wings on her back also emitted a layer of golden brilliance. What did the Heavenly Eye acupoint bring to the Phoenix clan? It brought the ability to instantly reach any of the Phoenix Nine Transformations she could achieve, skipping the intermediate steps. The appearance of the fourth transformation, Phoenix Shadow Three Divisions, made the aura around Bingyun's body surge. The surrounding ice and snow instantly solidified. Her body almost vanished from the original Ice Snow Goddess's domain in an instant.\n\nBoom! With Xilun's combined attack, the Ice Snow Goddess's dragon, along with the Ice Snow Goddess's domain, completely turned into ice powder filling the sky, and the next moment it was vaporized in the scorching airflow. Xilun's body shot out of the surrounding water vapor like a cannonball, using the last bit of energy he could utilize to escape into the distance. Because of his sudden acceleration, Oscar's breath attack behind him had reached his chest. Although Oscar's speed had increased to the limit, he could not catch up to Xilun, who had sacrificed his Xijing acupoint to condense innate energy, in a short time, unless his Xijing acupoint's explosive energy could no longer be sustained.\n\nHowever, just as Xilun felt his body lighten and sensed his escape, a cold voice echoed in his ears, \"Phoenix—Wing—Vibration—Five—Colors—Dance.\" Dazzling five-colored light quietly appeared not far in front of him. Those three illusory figures, shimmering with five-colored light, floated quietly in mid-air. A giant mirror appeared before these three figures. In the mirror, Xilun could only see himself. The surrounding air seemed to freeze, and his body became extremely sluggish. Although all this was relative, he could only watch himself crash into the mirror.\n\nA low chanting sound had not stopped since the appearance of the three five-colored figures. The three figures were chanting different incantations simultaneously. If one listened carefully, the transitions of their chants were so beautiful that the three voices had almost no pause. And that giant mirror had now become Xilun's nightmare.\n\n\"Pure maiden of ice, who understands the principle of surging waves, beautiful empress, azure extreme of ice! My great ally. Following the sacred contract of blood, from the beginning of my clan's bloodline to the end of my clan's bloodline. Respond to my summons, freeze all enemies before me. The world of ice appears in the eternal realm, Forbidden. Eternal Frost Wave.\"\n\nThe incantations chanted by the three bodies simultaneously took only one-third of the original chanting time. Bingyun had cultivated ice magic since childhood, and her chanting was much faster than that of ordinary mages. Under the influence of her Ice Phoenix bloodline, the incantation for a forbidden spell was completed in almost just three breaths.\n\nFire Cloud Armor. Feeling the energy from the Xijing acupoint's explosion rapidly decreasing, and the fire elements around his body gradually disappearing, Xilun knew that the only thing he could rely on now was the divine artifact, the Fire Cloud Armor. His forward momentum remained unchanged, and his body twisted rapidly in the charge, as if shedding its skin like a snake, and he squeezed out of the Fire Cloud Armor.\n\n\"Go—\" The Fire Cloud Armor shot towards the giant mirror like a meteorite, while Xilun's body followed behind the mirror, flashing through like lightning. He had revealed his last trump card.\n\nJust as the Fire Cloud Armor was about to crash into the giant light mirror, an anomaly suddenly occurred. The giant light mirror stopped reflecting, and a blue light with a diameter of five zhang shot out. The light flashed and instantly engulfed the Fire Cloud Armor in front of it, simultaneously hitting Xilun, who was covered by the protective energy dispersed from the Fangjia acupoint. With Lan Chen's strength, the density of two consecutive forbidden spells could not have been achieved so quickly, but combined with the Phoenix's Fifth Transformation, it greatly increased her speed of condensing and releasing magic elements. At this moment, it was equivalent to three Archmages attacking Xilun simultaneously, with control completely in Lan Chen's hands. Ice is the natural enemy of fire. Compared to the Ice Snow Goddess's dragon, the ice-based forbidden spell released by Lan Chen at this time was much stronger in attack intensity, but its flexibility and control were considerably weaker. But now Xilun no longer had space crystals for instant movement. After repeated major consumptions, he could no longer use his formidable fire-attribute battle qi to effectively attack and counter Lan Chen.\n\nThe Fire Cloud Armor, having broken free from Xilun's control, was a divine artifact, but at this time, it could not unleash its full power. It fell towards the ground in the ice, while the transforming blue light beam only slightly delayed before accurately hitting Xilun's body. A scream of horror sounded, and Xilun's flying body fell from the sky, the last defense of the Fangjia acupoint instantly crumbling. The innate energy absorbed by the Xijing acupoint's explosion had also reached its limit. The ice elements in the air converged, and Lan Chen's face was a little pale. The Ice Snow Goddess's domain was broken, and she instantly used the Phoenix's Fifth Transformation to forcibly cast a forbidden spell, pushing her body to the limit of its capacity. The three figures reunited into one, and the ice wings on her back spread out, controlling her body to float in mid-air, watching Xilun's body fall.\n\nAt this time, Nian Bing was still a hundred zhang away from the place where Xilun and Lan Chen were fighting. Just then, Xilun, falling from the sky, displayed a tenacious vitality like a cockroach. A mouthful of blood spurted from his mouth, and the ice barrier that had sealed his body after breaking the Fangjia acupoint instantly shattered. His rapidly descending body suddenly slowed down, and a spherical red crystal appeared in his hand, emitting a scorching aura that enveloped his body. Xilun, with his surging vital energy, desperately absorbed the energy provided by the crystal. His descending body suddenly charged diagonally towards Lan Chen, who had revealed her true form in the air. The speed was seemingly even faster than before. As he charged upward, the red crystal in his hand turned into powder and scattered in the air, merging with the flames that reappeared around his body. Lan Chen had thought Xilun had no ability to resist and, coupled with the burden of continuously casting two forbidden spells, she was absorbing ice elements from the air to recover. Suddenly, Xilun charged towards her. She had no good way to resist. She grudgingly condensed a large number of ice cones and shot them towards Xilun. After all, she was not Nian Bing; without the support of incantations, she could not cast powerful magic. Xilun had obviously seized upon this point. The ice cones melted into water in the fire battle qi and drifted down around his body. Just before Nian Bing arrived, he had reached Lan Chen's back, and the scorching light of flames enveloped both of them. He no longer had the ability to fly. One hand grasped Lan Chen's shoulder, and the other clutched her throat, using Lan Chen's wings on her back to barely control his body from falling. At this moment, Xilun's eyes were filled with ferocity. He saw Nian Bing, riding on Oscar's back, rapidly approaching.\n\nNian Bing was overjoyed when he saw Xilun being struck down by Lan Chen's forbidden spell, but the sudden change in the blink of an eye turned his excitement into fear. If Xilun feared death the most, then Nian Bing feared the harm to his beloved wife and friends the most. He quickly sent a message to Oscar, and with his huge golden-gray dragon wings unfurled, Oscar's body stabilized after a brief deceleration, stopping thirty zhang away from Lan Chen and Xilun. Nian Bing stared coldly at Xilun and said in a deep voice, \"Let her go.\" He would rather let Xilun leave alive than see his beloved wife suffer even the slightest harm.\n\nXilun was panting continuously. Apart from the Fire Cloud Armor, he was wearing a red warrior's uniform underneath, which was now extremely tattered. Blood continuously seeped from his seven orifices. The face revealed from behind Bingyun looked extremely ferocious. Although he was at the end of his rope, killing Bingyun, who was in his grasp, was not an easy task. In his eyes, apart from ferocity, there was only intense hatred. Being pushed to such a state by Nian Bing and the others had severely damaged his cultivation, which he had painstakingly cultivated for thousands of years. How could he not hate them? Even if he survived and left here, let alone recovering his divine-level strength, it would be difficult for him to even reach the demigod level. Without the Xijing acupoint, the Fangjia acupoint was also equivalent to being paralyzed. Intense pain was constantly coming from his lower abdomen. Everything in front of him was becoming blurry.\n\n\"Let her go? Kid, are you dreaming? Yes, very good. To take such a beauty as a companion before dying.\" In Xilun's sinister voice, he tightened his grip on Lan Chen's throat. Lan Chen's face immediately became much paler. Her magical power had been temporarily sealed the moment Xilun grasped her throat. She was completely held hostage. She kept signaling to Nian Bing, telling him not to mind her and to kill Xilun first. However, how could Nian Bing not be wary of her life and death? Killing Xilun was important, but Lan Chen's life was even more important.\n\n\"Let her go, and I'll let you leave without any obstruction.\" Nian Bing had revealed his trump card. In fact, not only was Xilun at the end of his rope, but Nian Bing was also not feeling well. Previously, he had continuously cast his domain and six forbidden spells. Although most of them were triggered by leveraging the power of heaven and earth through his powerful mental energy and innate energy, they also placed a great burden on him. His magic power was greatly weakened, and his mental energy had also diminished due to the continuous control of six forbidden spells. After all, magic is different from battle qi. Casting six level-eleven forbidden spells almost instantly is difficult even for a divine-level mage. If the Imperial Emperor acupoint in Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye acupoint had not been opened, his situation would have been much better. But now, his situation was not optimistic, especially after casting the Death Scythe again.\n\n\"Let me go? Do you take me for a three-year-old? Why should I believe you? I'm afraid your attack will come as soon as I let her go.\" Xilun looked at Nian Bing with some sarcasm. As a selfish divine being, in his mind, no one was trustworthy.",

    "content": "However, upon hearing Nian Bing's words, Xilun understood even more clearly the importance of the beauty in his hands to the powerful magician before him, and saw a glimmer of hope. The hand gripping Lan Chen's throat loosened a bit, and he coldly said, \"Girl, use your wings to take me away, do you hear me? Quickly. Kid, if you dare to chase after me, I will perish with her.\"\n\nListening to Xilun's words, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a bit flustered. If Lan Chen were taken away by him like this, the consequences were imaginable. But if he refused now, he might kill his Chen Chen immediately. Just as Nian Bing was hesitating, he suddenly saw the silver speck of light on Lan Chen's forehead, and hope was rekindled. He immediately thought of a plan. He said loudly, \"Alright, Xilun, I'll let Chen Chen take you away. However, you must promise me not to hurt her. Otherwise, even if I chase you to the Divine Continent, I will not let you go.\" Nian Bing's voice was stern and fierce, glaring at Xilun as if he could devour him. Seeing him like this, Xilun felt much more relaxed. Nian Bing's outward fierceness and inner weakness clearly told him that his choice was correct.\n\nUnfortunately, Xilun was behind Lan Chen at the moment and couldn't see the silver speck of light on Lan Chen's forehead, which represented the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, illuminating and turning Lan Chen's eyes silver. Lan Chen spread her wings and flew westward. Just as Xilun thought he had succeeded and his mind relaxed slightly, he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his brain, as if being pricked by needles. The hand gripping Lan Chen's throat and shoulder immediately loosened. Lan Chen's body flickered like an illusion, and in a blink of an eye, she had flown out ten zhang. Seeing Xilun's body falling, countless ice cones shot out.\n\nNian Bing's action was a step faster than Lan Chen's. The moment her body separated from Xilun, several corrosive black shadows shot out. Xilun's body in mid-air instantly decomposed, and his limbs emitted a layer of dark green light. With a \"poof, poof\" sound, they rapidly melted. When the ice cones arrived, they hit nothing but a pair of green liquids. The level thirteen Xilun was finally destroyed.\n\nNian Bing flickered and hugged her tightly, as if afraid she would disappear immediately.\n\nLan Chen could clearly feel Nian Bing's rapid heartbeat. She put her arm around him. For that brief moment, it felt like a century had passed for them. It turned out that when Nian Bing saw the Heavenly Eye Acupoint on Lan Chen's forehead, he suddenly remembered mental attacks. Under normal circumstances, if Lan Chen's Heavenly Eye Acupoint, which had just reached the elementary stage, were to launch a mental attack, it would not cause any damage to Xilun. Instead, Lan Chen would suffer a backlash. But it was different just now. After suffering Nian Bing's, Xi Lu's, and Lan Chen's full attacks in succession, Xilun was extremely weak, only able to threaten Nian Bing and Lan Chen by relying on his will to survive. Lan Chen's elementary Heavenly Eye Acupoint naturally couldn't achieve a mental physical attack yet, but a mental wave impact was still possible. While Nian Bing was sternly threatening Xilun, he used his soul transmission to give Lan Chen the method of mental power attack, which was how Lan Chen was able to escape Xilun's control and be destroyed by Nian Bing's ninth-order dark corrosive magic.\n\nNian Bing gently stroked Lan Chen's dark green long hair and comforted her, \"Good girl, it's okay. Don't be afraid, don't be afraid. It's all my fault, I didn't stop him and almost harmed you.\"\n\nLan Chen chuckled and said, \"It's not me who's afraid, it's you, right? That guy is really powerful, he could still counterattack even after taking two of my forbidden spells. No wonder you're so wary of divine beings.\"\n\nNian Bing sighed and said, \"This Xilun is only a second-rate divine being. There are even stronger existences. Ah! Let's hurry back and see. Xi Lu's attack just now was dodged by him and directly hit the ground. I don't know how he is.\" As he spoke, he waved his hand, and the soul of the Zhengyang Saber, the Fire Shadow Puppet, floated out. The fire element melted the ice on the Fire Cloud Armor that had landed on the ground. The Fire Shadow Puppet transformed into a size comparable to Xilun's body and put on the Fire Cloud Armor. Nian Bing, with Lan Chen, returned to Oscar's back and flew in the direction they came from. At the same time, to avoid being naked and exposed when his scales disappeared and he needed to use space, he did not fuse with Oscar's body again. Instead, he first came into contact with the protection of the scales, put on a set of clothes, and then had Oscar carry him and Bing Yun back.\n\nWhen Nian Bing and Lan Chen returned to the place where he and Xi Lu had fought Xilun, Feng Nu, Yu Ruyan, and Long Ling had all arrived. Even Mu Jing had brought her subordinate experts. Xi Lu was sitting on the ground, panting. Apart from Xi Lu, everyone else was stunned by what had happened on the ground. What Nian Bing saw was a giant canyon. Judging by the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, the canyon was about five zhang wide and over three hundred zhang deep, extending for thousands of zhang. There was no dust, and the dark canyon lay across the plain like a giant gaping maw.\n\n\"God Slaying Slash!\" The power of the \"God Slaying Slash\" unleashed by Xi Lu was so immense that it was shocking. Mu Jing was the most shocked because she was familiar with the local geography. On the surface, it was a fertile plain, but in reality, after ten zhang underground, it was composed of hard and complex rock formations. Xi Lu had already reverted to his original dwarf form, and Mu Jing did not recognize his identity. However, this incredible scene deeply shocked her. Was this achievable by human hands? She felt fortunate that if it hadn't been for Nian Bing's suggestion, if this huge canyon had appeared in Maple Forest City in the Langmu Empire, it would have been more than just panic. Yet, even with such a powerful attack, Xilun was not destroyed. The terror of divine beings was deeply imprinted in Mu Jing's memory, and she couldn't help but feel a deep sense of dread for having colluded with the tiger before.\n\nNian Bing appeared riding Oscar, which also caused great shock to Mu Jing and her subordinates. What was that? A gray giant dragon? It was by no means comparable to an ordinary earth dragon, but a true dragon! Seeing Nian Bing and Lan Chen descend gracefully on the giant dragon, as if they were gods, they all opened their mouths wide, as the scene before them was too shocking.\n\nWith a flash of gray light, Oscar's soul returned to Nian Bing's body to reside, while Nian Bing himself landed beside Xi Lu. A soft white light enveloped Xi Lu, healing his injuries.\n\n\"What a powerful God Slaying Slash!\" Nian Bing was also shocked in his heart upon seeing the canyon. He knew that if the God Slaying Slash had directly hit Xilun, whose Xijing Acupoint had exploded, Xilun would not have been able to escape, let alone survive. The powerful attack that Xi Lu had unleashed in an instant was also the first time Nian Bing had witnessed it. He vaguely felt that it was an attack that surpassed level thirteen.\n\nUnder the effect of Nian Bing's light magic, Xi Lu's wounds healed, and he stood up with some swaying. His Dwarf God Armor jiggled slightly, shaking off the dust, and he asked, \"How is that guy?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"He's dead. I didn't expect a level thirteen divine being to cause us so much trouble. This Xilun's strength is far greater than I imagined. If he hadn't been determined to escape and had been severely wounded by us multiple times, we might have been seriously injured even if we killed him.\" His judgment was correct. At their level, battle intent could play a decisive role in combat. Xilun had been suppressed by Nian Bing's mental pressure since his appearance, overestimating Nian Bing's strength. With the timidity that arose in his heart, he hadn't unleashed his full strength at all. Even so, he had caused such great trouble for Nian Bing and Xi Lu, and almost escaped by taking Lan Chen as a hostage. After this battle, Nian Bing had to re-evaluate the strength of divine beings.\n\nXilun had been eliminated, and Xi Lu was safe. Nian Bing's heart relaxed. His body swayed slightly, and Lan Chen quickly supported him. Nian Bing shook his head and said, \"Don't worry, I'm fine, just a bit depleted. Jing'er, I've done what I promised you. When we get back, you need to keep your subordinates quiet and not leak the matter of divine beings coming to your Langmu Empire, lest it attract other divine beings.\"\n\nMu Jing walked up to Nian Bing and said with concern, \"Brother, are you alright? I didn't expect that Xilun to be so powerful. Let's go back and rest for a while.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Brother Xi Lu, this Fire Cloud Armor is an item of your clan. It's time to return it to its rightful owner.\" The Fire Shadow Puppet came before Xi Lu, flickered, and disappeared into Nian Bing's body. The slightly damaged Fire Cloud Armor appeared before Xi Lu. Xi Lu stroked the scorching armor, and his eyes were a little moist. He recalled the deeds of his ancestors in forging the twelve divine artifacts, and regaining this divine armor further proved the truth of the legends. He gave Nian Bing a deep look. Brothers didn't need to say thank you. With a wave of his hand, the black crystal on the chest of the Dwarf God Armor lit up, and the Fire Cloud Armor was stored within it.\n\nWhen everyone returned to the camp, the members of the Langmu Empire delegation looked at Nian Bing and Xi Lu with different expressions. There was fear, and there was respect.\n\nAlthough Xilun was killed, both Nian Bing and Xi Lu were greatly depleted. As soon as they returned to the camp, they were helped onto carriages by Feng Nu and the others to begin recovering through cultivation, while Feng Nu and the others guarded the carriages to protect them. Lan Chen briefly explained the process of killing Xilun, which made Yu Ruyan and Feng Nu break out in a cold sweat. Although Nian Bing had mentioned divine beings to Yu Ruyan before, this was the first time she truly understood the power of divine beings. At the same time, she understood why Nian Bing had intervened to maintain peace among the four nations at the Grand Conference.\n\nSitting cross-legged in the carriage, the light sphere formed by magical power in Nian Bing's body spun rapidly, absorbing various magical elements from the air to replenish himself. The Life Sphere and Death Sphere within his body were the purest innate energies. Although the Lishui Acupoint could not be used, the speed of condensing magical elements far surpassed that of ordinary mages. The lost magical power was quickly replenished. At the same time, although the golden sphere formed by the fusion of his Heavenly Eye Acupoint and the Imperial Acupoint consumed his spiritual power very quickly when using his oppressive aura, its recovery speed was also astonishing. The feeling of weakness disappeared an hour after he began to cultivate.\n\nIn recent days, although Nian Bing had been cultivating every day, due to too many things, his cultivation time was significantly less than when he was on the Divine Continent. However, he found that the innate energy on the Yangguang Continent was significantly more vast and much gentler than on the Divine Continent. After absorbing it into his body, it almost only required simple filtration to be put to use. As his spiritual power gradually recovered, Nian Bing was surprised to find that the innate energy within his body seemed a bit strange. Since he had the Death Sphere and the Life Sphere, when he cultivated and absorbed innate energy, the innate energy would always condense around the outer layer of the Life Sphere, forming a faint white halo, as if the Life Sphere was guarding the Death Sphere. Because Nian Bing possessed the Life Sphere, his communication with external magical elements was very easy. Therefore, in recent days, Nian Bing had not deliberately pursued the cultivation of innate energy, but had let it flow naturally. At this moment, as his innate energy was gradually increasing, it had actually detached from the range of the Life Sphere and formed a small white vortex, spinning rapidly three inches below the Life Sphere. Nian Bing clearly felt that after the appearance of this white vortex, his head and tailbone became very cool, and the almost solidified and compressed innate energy penetrated into his body from these two places, making the cultivation speed much faster than usual. Just as he was wondering what was happening, the white vortex began to move downward, and the vortex itself spun faster and faster. Without Nian Bing's deliberate control, the innate energy within his body had become extremely abundant.\n\nThe green Life Sphere emitted a layer of life aura and merged into the white vortex. The green light transformed into a green light spot and shot directly into the center of the vortex. After it entered, the white vortex paused for a moment, and then its rotational speed abruptly increased threefold, making his head and tailbone even colder. At this instant, Nian Bing's mind was instantly enlightened. He recalled the scene when he had absorbed the essence of the sun and moon. The pure innate energy from his head and tailbone, which he felt as coolness, should be the essence of heaven and earth! Seeing the direction the vortex was heading, he was overjoyed and immediately opened his body and mind, abandoning all worries, allowing his body to absorb the vast innate energy more effectively. Three inches below the navel, in his lower abdomen, was the destination of the vortex, and that was precisely the location of the Xijing Acupoint.\n\nIn fact, the Death Sphere and the Life Sphere that Nian Bing absorbed on the Divine Continent were the most vast and extreme forms of primal energy, two extreme energies. Either one was far stronger than the ultimate Xijing Acupoint.",

    "content": "However, it was precisely because these two forces were too powerful that Nian Bing could not truly use their abilities. Under the combined efforts of Ka'ao and Tian Xiang, these two exceptionally concentrated energy spheres could be said to be seeds planted by them on Nian Bing. Life and death were in a delicate balance within Nian Bing's body, neither usable by him nor harmful to his body. The existence of these two energy spheres also allowed Nian Bing to resonate with the pure primordial energy between heaven and earth. After waking up on the Continent of the Gods, he cultivated for another half a year. This half-year was not wasted; not only did his magical power increase, but his primordial energy also underwent a qualitative change. If Nian Bing had not deliberately cultivated his primordial energy, his Xi Jing acupoint would have already opened. And today, just as Xi Lun exploded his Xi Jing acupoint, an invisible fluctuation occurred in the hall of primordial energy. This fluctuation infected Nian Bing's body, to be precise, it infected the primordial energy within his body. After killing Xi Lun and undergoing recovery cultivation, his own primordial energy, under the infection of this fluctuation, mysteriously communicated with the essence of heaven and earth, pushing him towards another advancement.\n\nWhen the wondrous vortex reached Nian Bing's abdomen, its tip stopped three inches below his navel. Nian Bing's entire body trembled violently. At the tip of the vortex, he clearly felt something break open. Immediately after, the previously rotating white vortex began a vigorous compression process. His lower abdomen felt swollen and painful, as if his body were about to explode. Having experienced too many cycles of pain, this amount of pain was nothing to Nian Bing. He watched as the white airflow continuously underwent condensation in his lower abdomen. Just then, he suddenly felt his mind clear. A golden light descended gracefully from the fused Heavenly Eye and Imperial Sovereign acupoints, directly enveloping the compressing milky white primordial energy light mass. The swollen and painful feeling disappeared. Nian Bing watched as the milky white light rapidly contracted under the illumination of the golden light from his Cinnabar Field at the center of his brow. In a short while, it condensed into a white halo three inches below his navel, with blackness in the center. Like a bottomless abyss, the primordial energy he had absorbed poured into the black hole and disappeared. Nian Bing realized that the aura around his body was completely different. He could detect every trace of primordial energy in the air, and this primordial energy seemed to be revolving around the Xi Jing acupoint he had just opened. The seven elemental magic elements were also neatly arranged around his body in bands, driven by this primordial energy, as if awaiting his command. The Xi Jing acupoint, indeed, was the Xi Jing acupoint that guided primordial energy!\n\nAlthough he couldn't explain why, Nian Bing could feel that his Xi Jing acupoint was not in its initial stage, as expected of a newly opened acupoint, but had directly entered the intermediate stage. Nian Bing had clearly observed the energy fluctuations of Xi Lun controlling the primordial energy around his body through his Heavenly Eye acupoint. He found that his current Xi Jing acupoint's ability to control the condensation, contraction, and release of primordial energy was no less than Xi Lun's. An acupoint, upon opening, reaching the intermediate stage meant he would save countless hours in the future, but why? Ah! That's it. It must be his fused Heavenly Eye and Imperial Sovereign acupoint. It was precisely under the illumination of the golden light from it that the Xi Jing acupoint instantly transformed, even saving him the process of enduring pain. The Heavenly Eye acupoint and the Imperial Sovereign acupoint must have undergone an anomaly during their fusion, leading to this situation. If every acupoint he opened in the future could reach the intermediate stage, even if the Heavenly Eye acupoint's ability could no longer be used, it would still bring great benefits!\n\nThinking of this with excitement, Nian Bing felt his chest surge with energy, and he couldn't help but let out a long roar. The sound waves rolled upwards, and every meridian in his body seemed to become active, even his blood boiled.\n\nThe roar continued for the time it takes to eat a meal before stopping. When Nian Bing opened his eyes, he was surprised to find that he was already sitting on the ground, and the luxurious carriage had turned into a pile of debris. Shao Lu, Yu Ru Yan, and others, as well as Mu Jing and her subordinates, were all standing at a distance, looking at him as if he were a monster. Nian Bing looked down and breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, his clothes were still there; otherwise, he would have been embarrassed. With a thought, he stood up. Feeling the neatly arranged magic elements and abundant primordial energy in the air, he knew his strength had increased again.\n\n\"Don't look at me like that. I'm not a monster.\" Seeing that everyone was still looking at him with the same expressions, Nian Bing couldn't help but say with a laugh. As he spoke, he moved his feet and appeared before everyone. His powerful physique, combined with his immense magic and mental power, which even he himself couldn't determine the level of, had shaped him into a true powerhouse.\n\nShao Lu mumbled, \"You still say you're not a monster? Good thing I found out early, otherwise, if you exploded, I would have been decomposed like that carriage.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"I don't have that much power, do I, Big Brother? Don't I know how strong your body is?\" With his Xi Jing acupoint opened, his mood was exceptionally good. Everything around him seemed to have become more brilliant than before. It was then that he noticed that the end of the ravine that Shao Lu had cleaved the previous night had actually extended to near where the envoy was stationed. Fortunately, the power had greatly diminished.\n\nMu Jing walked up to Nian Bing, \"Brother, are you really not going to Maple Leaf City with me?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"I've done what I promised you. Jing'er, you must take good care of yourself and remember the promise I made to you back then.\"\n\nMu Jing sighed lightly, \"It's good that you're not going. Once I get to Maple Leaf City, everything will be beyond my control. Brother, you and my sisters-in-law, please take care. I wish you a safe journey.\" Although her emotions were surging within her, she didn't express them excessively. Did she truly only have sisterly affection for Nian Bing? Only she herself knew. However, no matter what she thought, she didn't want to make things difficult for Nian Bing. In her heart, Nian Bing's position was incomparable to anyone else. What could be more important than someone who genuinely cared about her? Even if he only saw her as a sister.\n\nMu Jing left with her envoy. Her desolate gaze as she left did not escape Nian Bing's eyes, nor did it escape Feng Nu and the others. However, Feng Nu and Yu Ru Yan were visibly in low spirits. No one said anything more, they simply watched the Mu Jing caravan depart quietly.\n\n\"Mom, are you worried?\" Nian Bing stood beside Yu Ru Yan. Yu Ru Yan sighed lightly, \"Although neither Feng Nu nor I have ever thought of leaving the Phoenix Tribe, can our actions gain the approval of our tribesmen? Will they still accept us?\"\n\n\"Why not? Mom. There's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time. Perhaps it's because you're too close to the situation that you haven't thought it through clearly.\"\n\nYu Ru Yan was stunned and said, \"What is it? Tell me.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, took Feng Nu's hand, and said, \"Mom. Have you ever considered that if your tribesmen truly no longer acknowledge you, or even hate you, then could you reunite with your own biological daughter? Feng Nu, let me ask you, how have the elders of the Phoenix Tribe treated you? How much importance have they placed on you?\"\n\nFeng Nu said, \"The elders have treated me very well. Every elder in the tribe has treated me very well. They have taught me the Phoenix Tribe's ultimate techniques without reservation, and they have also confirmed me as the Phoenix of Hope during inter-tribal competition. I have never forgotten the kindness of the elders in raising me, which is precisely why I did not dare to accept your feelings back then, and why I must return now.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"That's enough. Mom, don't you understand yet? If the elders had not forgiven you back then, Feng Nu would probably be dead by now. Their kindness to Feng Nu proves that these elders have never forgotten you. They also haven't treated her poorly because she is your daughter with a human. The Phoenix of Hope, in the Phoenix Tribe, must have a very high status, right? Feng Nu being able to become the Phoenix of Hope proves that the elders of the Phoenix Tribe have already forgiven you long ago. Their actions towards Feng Nu prove that they are kind. When you can return with Feng Nu in times of crisis, they will only be happy; they won't make things difficult for you out of selfishness. To take a step back, even if they truly expel you from the Phoenix Tribe, would you not secretly offer help to aid your tribesmen? Therefore, you don't need to worry about anything now. I believe those elders are not unreasonable people.\"\n\nAfter hearing Nian Bing's words, Yu Ru Yan's somewhat dim eyes suddenly brightened. Yes! If the elders had not forgiven her, how could they have allowed her daughter to become the Phoenix of Hope of the Phoenix Tribe?\n\nNian Bing glanced at Lan Chen, who was not far away, and said, \"The one who needs to worry now is Chen Chen. Originally, I believed that your and Feng Nu's strength would be sufficient to handle everything. However, Feng Nu mentioned that Chen Chen's Ice Phoenix's poverty might have a significant impact on this grand ceremony of the Phoenix Tribe. Therefore, I must go with you.\"\n\nLan Chen was also Yu Ru Yan's main concern. Seeing Nian Bing's determined gaze, Yu Ru Yan finally showed a hint of a smile, \"Nian Bing, it seems my daughters' instincts were right.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Of course, I will always protect them. Alright, Mom, we should be on our way. The sooner we arrive at your Phoenix Tribe, the more time we will have for preparations.\"\n\nWithout the burden of the envoy, the group set off again. Nian Bing, using his wind magic, carried Shao Lu in flight, while Feng Nu assisted Long Ling. The group of six headed northwest towards the Langmu Empire.\n\nFlying was naturally much faster than traveling on foot. In just two days, they had approached their destination. From afar, a large area of dense primeval forest appeared below, and even the air in the sky had become significantly fresher. The combination of Nian Bing and these six people could be considered the strongest combination on the Continent of Radiant Light. Lan Chen, who was close to a God Descender, Long Ling, an Ice Mage, Yu Ru Yan and Feng Nu, who were infinitely close to the God Master realm, the Dwarf Warrior Shao Lu, who had reached the God level, and Nian Bing, an Ice and Fire Dragon Mage who had reached the God Descender realm – what a powerful combination! On the way, Nian Bing once joked that if they formed an adventure team, all the mercenary groups on the Continent of Radiant Light would probably be out of jobs.\n\nAs they were about to reach the edge of the Firewood Forest, Yu Ru Yan said, \"Let's go down.\"\n\nLong Ling asked curiously, \"Auntie, aren't we flying directly to the Phoenix Tribe's habitat? This primeval forest is undeveloped, and it might delay our time.\"\n\nYu Ru Yan smiled gently and said, \"This is out of respect for our tribesmen. Our Phoenix Tribe, as long as they are core members with royal feathers, can fly with wings. However, no one has ever soared above their own forest; it would be considered an act of blasphemy against the ancestor Phoenix.\"\n\nThe group landed at the edge of the Firewood Forest. Yu Ru Yan said, \"Nian Bing, if my tribesmen make things difficult for you after we meet them, I hope you can endure it as much as possible, even if it's for Feng Nu and Chen Chen, alright?\" She had witnessed Nian Bing's power, and if his anger were provoked by the provocations of the Phoenix Tribe members, she might not be able to stop him, which was why she had warned Nian Bing in advance.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Mom, please don't worry. I won't argue with the Phoenix Tribe for your sake. I'm no longer the child I was before.\" Looking at Yu Ru Yan's face, which seemed to have never aged, he couldn't help but recall the first time he met her and Lan Chen, and a warmth filled his heart.\n\nWith the help of Nian Bing's Chang Sheng Blade, Shao Lu transformed back into his ordinary human appearance. Hearing this, he said, \"Our clan's ancient texts once recorded that the ancestor of the Phoenix Tribe, the Phoenix, also appeared on the Lost Continent and died during the great war of divine descent. The Phoenix Tribe is a peace-loving race, but at the same time, they are a very exclusive race. Nian Bing, our journey ahead may not be smooth.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"I can endure being hit without retaliating and being scolded without answering back. Big Brother, please bear with me.\"\n\nShao Lu nodded and said, \"We can only do that. Then we can set off.\" After following Nian Bing to the Continent of Radiant Light, Shao Lu had come into contact with many humans, but he never spoke to anyone else, not even Lan Chen and the others. If Nian Bing did not speak, he would silently follow Nian Bing. If it weren't for his earth-shattering strike that day, Yu Ru Yan and the others might not have realized his true identity. After learning that Shao Lu was a dwarf and witnessing his strength, Yu Ru Yan understood that this dwarf was much older than her, and she had always been very respectful towards him on the road.",

    "content": "The name of Firewood Forest came from the Phoenix Volcano in the forest. The volcano erupted once every hundred years, but this primeval forest had never been destroyed. This was all thanks to the Phoenix clan. The reason ordinary humans did not live here was not only due to their fear of the volcano, but also because many fierce beasts lived in this fire forest. As they walked through the rugged forest, Feng Nü introduced the various animals in the forest to Nian Bing and the others.\n\n\"Sister, you said these animals are so fierce, why haven't they bothered us?\" They had been walking for half a day, and it felt like they had traveled a considerable distance, yet Firewood Forest still seemed boundless.\n\nHearing Lan Chen's question, Feng Nü smiled and said, \"Although animals don't have human intelligence, they are very spiritual. In this forest, we, the Phoenix clan, are the kings of the forest. No matter what kind of animal it is, as soon as they sense the aura of our Phoenix clan on us, they will keep their distance and naturally won't dare to offend us.\"\n\nLong Ling giggled and said, \"So animals also bully the weak and fear the strong! Sister Feng Nü, how much further until we reach the Wutong forest where your Phoenix clan resides!\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled slightly and said, \"We'll be there soon. Our travel speed is very fast. This primeval forest has grown for an unknown amount of time. Although it makes people feel like it's endless, in reality, behind the giant trees is our Wutong forest.\"\n\nAs Feng Nü was speaking, Nian Bing's expression suddenly changed, and he looked forward, shouting in a deep voice, \"Who's there?\"\n\nThree lightning-fast figures flashed through the forest. After a few graceful movements, they appeared about thirty feet in front of the group.\n\nThey were three young men, all male. The leader was about Nian Bing's height, with sword-like eyebrows and bright eyes. His ordinary coarse cloth clothing could not conceal his heroic spirit, and his fiery red short hair stood on end. When he landed and stood still, his gaze was fixed on Feng Nü, his eyes constantly fluctuating with desire and some unnamable negative emotions.\n\nFeng Nü was also a little stunned. Looking at this handsome young man, her expression became somewhat stiff, \"Feng Ying.\"\n\nFeng Ying's gaze shifted from Feng Nü to the others with a complex expression. His voice trembled slightly, \"Feng Nü, you've returned, you've finally returned. I thought I would never see you again.\"\n\nFeng Nü forced a smile and said, \"The Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony is about to begin. As a member of the Phoenix clan, how can I not return? Please inform the elders of the clan that I have returned with my mother. We will wait here.\"\n\nFeng Ying was taken aback. \"Your mother? Weren't you orphaned at a young age?\"\n\n\"No, she not only has a mother but also a father. Judging by your age, you might not know me, but your elders definitely will. Go back and tell the elders that Feng Yan has returned with her daughter Lan Chen, Feng Nü, and several friends to participate in the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony. We will wait here.\" The one speaking was Yu Ruyan. Looking at the three young clansmen in front of her and breathing in the familiar air of Firewood Forest, her eyes were a little moist. After decades of separation, she had finally returned to her home. Her emotions were several times deeper than Feng Nü's.\n\nFeng Ying had now sobered up from the initial ecstasy of seeing Feng Nü. He looked at Yu Ruyan, who seemed not much older than Feng Nü, with a hint of confusion and frowned. He whispered a few words to his companion beside him, and a young Phoenix clan member quickly retreated and disappeared into the forest in the blink of an eye.\n\nFeng Ying's eyes were now solely on Feng Nü. Although there were six people in Feng Nü's group, the other five were merely distinguishable by gender in his eyes. As soon as his companion left, he flashed in front of Feng Nü and reached out to grab her, \"You've finally returned. Do you know how much I've missed you during this time? Feng Nü, don't worry, no matter what mistake you've made, I will help you. Don't leave again. You know my feelings. Your trial should have ended long ago. I don't know how many times I wanted to go out and find you, but my father never allowed it.\" His deeply affectionate gaze had already told everyone many things. However, Feng Nü subtly dodged his attempt to grab her.\n\n\"Feng Ying, don't be like this. I will handle my own matters with the elders.\" Feng Nü looked at Nian Bing by her side with a hint of apprehension. Nian Bing's expression hadn't changed, but the stillness in his eyes made Feng Nü feel uneasy.\n\nFeng Ying's expression changed slightly. He reached out to grab Feng Nü's hand again. However, this time Feng Nü retreated more obviously, moving a yard away with a slight sidestep. Feng Ying frowned and looked at her, \"Feng Nü, what's wrong this year? We were already engaged. We were supposed to get married officially after you returned from your trial. I heard my grandfather say that you fell for another man outside. I don't believe it. We grew up together as childhood sweethearts. You couldn't possibly like someone else, right?\"\n\nIf Nian Bing's gaze was merely still before, it had now become icy. He didn't speak or make any moves, just stood there. Long Ling voluntarily held Nian Bing's large hand, but at this moment, she was surprised to find that Nian Bing's hand was as cold as his eyes. At this moment, Nian Bing was waiting for Feng Nü's answer.\n\n\"Feng Ying, listen to me.\" Feng Nü said anxiously. She had naturally noticed the change in Nian Bing's expression. \"Feng Ying, I have two things to do this time. One is to participate in the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony and help our Phoenix clan overcome difficulties. The other is... the other is to break off our engagement. Although we grew up together, I have always regarded you as a friend, not a lover. I'm sorry, Elder Feng Xu was right. I have indeed fallen in love with someone else. He is my beloved. After this ceremony, I will leave with him and focus on being his wife.\"\n\nFeng Ying's whole body trembled, and his eyes immediately became agitated. He stumbled back a step, \"No, I don't believe this is true. You must be lying to me, right? We were already engaged, how could you fall for someone else? You're lying to me, you must be lying to me.\" Feng Nü was the most beautiful woman among the younger generation of the Phoenix clan, and Feng Ying was the most outstanding man among the younger generation. They had grown up together as childhood sweethearts. Feng Ying had always regarded Feng Nü as his future wife.\n\nIn contrast to Feng Ying's agitation, Nian Bing's gaze softened again. He shook his head self-deprecatingly and thought to himself, What's wrong with me? Why would I doubt Feng Nü's feelings for me? Although she hadn't told me she had a fiancé long ago, as long as her heart was with me, what did everything in the past matter?\n\nFeng Nü lowered her head and said, \"I'm sorry, Feng Ying. I know you've been very good to me, but I truly love someone else. He is my husband, and I will only love him in this lifetime. I know this is cruel to you, but it's better to have a short pain than a long one. Since I met you as soon as I returned, I'll make things clear to you first, so as to avoid any misunderstandings in the future. I'm sorry, Feng Ying.\"\n\n\"Sorry? What's the use of sorry? Don't you know that I've poured all my feelings into you? So many girls in the clan have confessed to me, but I've never overstepped, because I already have you in my heart. In my eyes, no one can compare to you. Sorry? Can these three words make up for my love for you?\" Feng Ying roared at Feng Nü, looking as if he had gone mad.\n\nNian Bing moved. He walked slowly to Feng Nü's side, extended his firm and powerful arm, and put it around Feng Nü's shoulder. \"Love cannot be measured by anything else. I hope you can respect Feng Nü's choice and stop making things difficult for her.\"\n\nFeng Ying's expression gradually turned cold. His icy gaze fell on Nian Bing's handsome face, \"He is the one you love?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Yes, I am her husband.\"\n\nFeng Ying took a deep breath, trying to calm his almost exploding blood qi, \"Fine, I challenge you to a duel.\"\n\nFeng Nü's expression changed. She quickly flashed in front of Nian Bing, \"No, Feng Ying, can you not do this?\" Her eyes were already a little red. Although she didn't love Feng Ying, how could she forget Feng Ying's care and concern for her since childhood? She had always regarded Feng Ying as her best friend.\n\nBefore Feng Ying could speak, Nian Bing gently patted Feng Nü's shoulder, \"Feng Nü, this is a matter between us men.\"\n\nFeng Nü's body trembled slightly. She turned to look at Nian Bing. Nian Bing nodded at her gently. A hint of sadness flashed in Feng Nü's eyes, \"I'm sorry, Bing. I, I...\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, tightened his grip on her shoulder, \"No need to say anything. What you just said to Feng Ying has told me everything. Don't worry, I won't hurt him. Love is not wrong. It's a pity that he loves someone who doesn't love him.\"\n\nFeng Nü nodded slightly and turned to walk away. If there was anyone she cared about the most, it was undoubtedly Nian Bing. As a man, Nian Bing would never back down from such a challenge.\n\nFeng Ying was almost bursting with anger. Judging by Nian Bing's demeanor, he clearly didn't take him seriously. He had always had a high opinion of himself. In the Phoenix clan, only he and Feng Nü were most likely to become the next elders.\n\nNian Bing looked up at Feng Ying and asked, \"Here?\"\n\nFeng Ying stared coldly into Nian Bing's eyes. He was suddenly surprised to find that he could not capture anything from Nian Bing's eyes. They were as deep as the ocean. However, at this moment, his heart had lost its reason due to intense jealousy and hatred. He said in a deep voice, \"Here. If you win, I will break off my engagement with Feng Nü. If you lose, please leave Feng Nü's side.\" His upbringing had allowed him to maintain some clarity at this moment.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Okay, then here it is. However, there are some things I want to say upfront. First, I am not fighting you to compete for Feng Nü, because there is no need to compete at all. Feng Nü is not a commodity, she is a person, and she has the right to choose the one she loves. I am fighting you to make you understand that I am stronger than you, more qualified to be Feng Nü's lover, and more capable of protecting her. Second, I also want to tell you that you cannot defeat me.\" His immense confidence made Nian Bing's aura soar. He stood there, looking at Feng Ying, his body as stable as a mountain.\n\nThe Phoenix clan members who came with Feng Ying thought Nian Bing was crazy. He knew how powerful Feng Ying was. However, Yu Ruyan and the others who came with Nian Bing were not surprised at all, because they understood that Nian Bing had the right to say such things and also possessed the strength to back them up. This was a battle between men, and none of them would interfere, as it concerned the dignity of both parties.\n\nNian Bing did not summon his seven divine blades. He stood there leisurely, looking at Feng Ying in front of him. In order to defeat his love rival in front of his beloved Feng Nü, Feng Ying used his full strength from the start. Nine Li Battle Qi surged out, and with a tearing sound, a pair of huge Royal Feathers appeared behind him. When Feng Nü left for her trial, he could not use such an ability, but in the past few years, Feng Ying had made great progress. As the Royal Feathers appeared, golden phoenix flames surged out, the surrounding temperature rose significantly, and the plants withered, creating a simple open space between the two.\n\nNian Bing still did not move. He looked at Feng Ying, his heart exceptionally calm. No matter who the opponent was, Nian Bing would not underestimate him. Faint seven-colored light already appeared around his body.\n\nFeng Ying did not draw the long sword on his back. His body floated about a foot off the ground with the effect of the Royal Feathers. \"Since you don't use a weapon, neither will I.\" With a flash, he had already created a trail of afterimages in the air and arrived in front of Nian Bing, punching Nian Bing's face without any fancy moves. This seemingly powerful punch was actually only thirty percent of Feng Ying's strength. This punch was merely a probe.\n\nNian Bing did not move, nor did he use magic to defend himself. He watched as Feng Ying's punch landed on his face.\n\nWith a bang, Nian Bing staggered back three steps before steadying himself. His head was tilted to the side due to the impact of the punch. Everyone present was shocked that Nian Bing had been hit. Feng Nü, Long Ling, and Lan Chen almost simultaneously cried out in surprise.\n\nNian Bing slowly turned his head back, nodded at Feng Ying, and said, \"Don't hold back, come on.\"\n\nFeng Ying's gaze towards Nian Bing became serious. He knew how much power his punch had. Although thirty percent of his strength was not enough, it was enough to smash a large piece of granite into pieces, yet the other party had only retreated a few steps before stopping. The moment his face made contact with Nian Bing, he clearly felt that Nian Bing had no protective Battle Qi, but his skin was very tough. The solid punch was instantly weakened by more than thirty percent upon contact with his skin. Moreover, the fire attribute of his Nine Li Battle Qi seemed to have had no effect.",

    "title": "Chapter 202: The Encounter of Huo Mulin (Part 2)",
    "content": "Feng Ying charged forward again, this time increasing his attack power to seventy percent. The palm shadows filled the sky, covering almost all possible evasive positions around Nian Bing's body. This was a move Feng Ying was very skilled at, named \"Phoenix Shadow Palm.\" Although the attack power was dispersed, once it made contact with the opponent's body, the scattered Dou Qi would instantly condense, inflicting heavy damage on the opponent.\n\nNian Bing still did not dodge. All the illusory palm shadows thrown by Feng Ying landed in empty space. As their bodies solidified simultaneously, Feng Ying's right palm remained on Nian Bing's chest. With a boom, Nian Bing was sent flying by the massive Jiuli Dou Qi, crashing into a tree that required two people to embrace before he stopped. His chest was already charred black.\n\nSliding down from the tree, Nian Bing did not fall. Standing on the ground, he didn't even glance at the charred mark on his chest and walked step by step towards Feng Ying, saying coldly, \"Again, is this all the strength you have?\"\n\nNian Bing's strong defense ignited Feng Ying's strong fighting spirit. With a fierce roar, his body flickered in the air. His originally solid body instantly became ethereal, charging towards Nian Bing like a cloud of fire. This was the \"Phoenix Illusion Body,\" the third transformation of the \"Nine Phoenix Transformations.\"\n\nSeeing Feng Ying pouncing towards him, Nian Bing no longer took the blows for nothing. Seven-colored light emanated from around his body simultaneously, expanding instantly. As soon as the red cloud transformed by Feng Ying entered the seven-colored light, the red light around his body weakened. When he reached Nian Bing, he had already returned to his original form. He struck Nian Bing's chest with a punch, but this time Nian Bing was not repelled. He just looked at him coldly, \"Do you understand?\"\n\nFeng Ying looked at Nian Bing with a ashen face. He understood, yet he also didn't understand. What he didn't understand was how Nian Bing broke his hard-earned third Phoenix transformation. What he understood was that he was no match for the man in front of him. The opponent had broken his three attacks relying solely on defense. If he had attacked him, could he have resisted?\n\nFeng Ying looked at Nian Bing with complex eyes, retracted his fist, and retreated three steps, taking a deep breath. He nodded forcefully and said, \"I understand. Perhaps, Feng Nu's choice was correct. Perhaps, you are indeed more suitable for her than I am.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"You understand the gap in strength, but you still don't understand a woman's heart. A girl might be attracted to a man with great strength, but it doesn't mean that whoever has greater strength can win her true love. Love has no reason. Your love for Feng Nu is not wrong, so I never attacked you. If you want to challenge me again, I will always welcome it. However, that will likely have to wait until you break through to the seventh transformation of the Phoenix Nine Transformations.\"\n\nFeng Ying looked at Nian Bing somewhat dejectedly. He didn't seem much older than himself, but why was the gap in strength so vast? Of course, he didn't know how much suffering Nian Bing had endured to achieve what he had today, how many times he had lingered on the brink of death. Feng Ying had excellent talent, but without truly experiencing storms, how could he compare to Nian Bing?\n\nJust as Nian Bing and Feng Ying were fighting, in the Phoenix Clan's Wutong Forest, two Phoenix Clan elders were looking at each other with worry.\n\nFeng Kong said, \"Second brother, should we really start the ceremony like this? Although Ying'er already has the ability of the third transformation, I'm afraid this ceremony...\"\n\nFeng Xu sighed, \"What do you want me to do? What choice do we have if we don't go through with it? I will bear the decline of the Phoenix Clan. If it weren't for the lack of outstanding talents in the clan over the years, how would we have fallen into such a state? Perhaps I was wrong back then. If Yan'er were still here, none of this would have happened.\"\n\nFeng Kong fell silent for a moment. In his understanding, Feng Xu had always been a stubborn elder brother. For him to admit his mistakes like this, all these changes were due to the grand ceremony about to take place! Feng Xu looked much older than before. He was already exhausted from pondering how to complete this ceremony every day.\n\nFeng Xu glanced at Feng Kong and said, \"There is no other good way now. This is all we can do. Alright, you don't need to worry too much. Perhaps our ancestor, the Phoenix, can understand our difficulties. The outbreak of this ceremony will not be so strong. Actually, do you know? When I was chasing Feng Yan back then, my heart struggled greatly, but at that time, in front of all the clansmen, I had to do it that way.\"\n\nFeng Kong smiled slightly and said, \"Others may not understand, but how can I not understand? Your pursuit was actually protection! Only after you found they could protect themselves did you leave. Alas, both Feng Yan and her daughter are so outstanding, much more outstanding than we imagined. If the clan didn't have so many rules, perhaps our mood for welcoming the ceremony this time would be extremely relaxed. Even I didn't expect Yan'er's strength to have improved so much, reaching the fifth transformation. It's been so many years, and we finally had a talented person in the Phoenix Clan, only to be expelled by the clan rules.\"\n\n\"Report!\" a young voice sounded from outside. Feng Xu, frowning in the room, said, \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Reporting to the two elders, there are a few people outside. Feng Nu is with them. One of them said that Feng Yan, along with her daughter Lan Chen, Feng Nu, and a few friends, have come to attend the clan ceremony.\"\n\nFeng Xu and Feng Kong simultaneously showed expressions of astonishment. After a brief daze, Feng Kong's face lit up with joy, \"Yan'er is back, Feng Nu is also back, this is truly wonderful! They never forgot the Phoenix Clan. They finally returned at the most crucial moment. Second brother, with their return, all our problems will be solved!\"\n\nFeng Xu's excitement differed from Feng Kong's. He frowned deeply, seemingly thinking about something. After hearing Feng Kong's words, he said, \"No, I'm afraid it's not that simple. If they returned to help us, why would they bring outsiders with them? Let's go and see. If she and Feng Nu have truly repented, then we can rest assured!\"\n\nFeng Ying leaned against the large tree nearby, his eyes vacant as he stared at the sky. The brief battle had completely shattered his confidence. He had never imagined he would lose to someone in such a manner, nor had he ever imagined that such a powerful existence could exist in the world. However, the facts were before him, and Nian Bing's strength gave him a completely new understanding.\n\nNian Bing also stood to the side, waiting with Yu Ruyan and others for the Phoenix clansmen who had gone to report back. Feng Nu held Nian Bing's hand, standing there with her head bowed, not saying a word, like a little wife who had made a mistake, afraid to look Nian Bing in the eyes.\n\nLong Ling and Lan Chen both stood to the side. Yu Ruyan was introducing the various plants in the forest to Xi Lu, seemingly paying no attention to Nian Bing and Feng Nu's situation.\n\n\"Do you have anything to say to me?\" Nian Bing brought Feng Nu's hand to his face. Looking at her long, slender jade hand, a gentle smile appeared on his face.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" Feng Nu seemed to muster all her courage before uttering those three words.\n\n\"No need to say sorry. You've said these three words too many times today. I just want to know why you didn't tell me? Back then, when you refused my affection, besides your clan's rules, there was also this engagement, wasn't there?\" Nian Bing's voice was very calm, but to Feng Nu's ears, it sounded like sarcasm.\n\nFeng Nu nodded gently and said, \"Feng Ying and I grew up together since childhood. In the eyes of the clansmen, we were a match made in heaven. When we were only ten years old, an engagement was set under the auspices of Elder Feng Xu. At that time, I thought there was no difference between a spouse and a friend, and no one had ever told me about the outside world. I treated Feng Ying as an elder brother, as a friend. But when I truly ventured out and started my own experiences, I gradually realized I was wrong. Especially after I met you, I realized how profoundly wrong I was. Friendship and love are completely different, but I knew my responsibility within the clan, so I dared not and could not accept you. However, so many things happened later, even I didn't expect things to develop to that extent. It was only then that I realized that when true love arrives, evasion is useless. That's why I became your Feng Nu. When you became a zombie and went to the Divine Continent, I had even forgotten that I was engaged. Do you know why I didn't tell you? Actually, in my heart, you are a very impulsive person, perhaps due to the parental hatred from childhood, so I was afraid to tell you. Although I don't love Feng Ying, he is my best friend. I was afraid that you would come to the Phoenix Clan and conflict with our clansmen and get hurt, and I was also afraid that you would kill him. Bing, thank you. You are more mature than before. You are no longer the Nian Bing who would impulsively act out of hatred.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"At first, I was indeed a little angry because you concealed such an important matter from me. But when you told Feng Ying that you were my woman, my anger had long since disappeared. The past is the past. Now you are mine, and you will be mine in the future. As long as the love between us does not change, no matter how great the storms, we can always bear them, can't we? Feng Ying is indeed worthy of being treated as a friend. From his appearance to our subsequent battle, I was observing him. Frankly speaking, he is jealous of me, and I am equally jealous of him! I am jealous that he could grow up with you. But from his demeanor, I realized that his character is simple and uncorrupted. How could I harm such a person? Alright, the past is the past. Now, what we have to face is your clan elders.\"\n\nAs soon as Nian Bing finished speaking, his dispersed spiritual power had already locked onto more than ten figures approaching. Although they were still dozens of feet away, Nian Bing's spiritual power clearly judged their movements. Judging from the auras of two of them, they were indeed the elders Feng Xu and Feng Kong.\n\nThe air flowed between the trees, and more than ten figures arrived nearby within a few breaths. Emerging from the dense trees, the first one to appear was none other than the Phoenix Clan Elder Feng Xu. Feng Kong followed closely behind, and the remaining were some Phoenix clansmen Nian Bing had never seen before. Their attire was almost identical, all in ordinary coarse cloth, but each of them possessed restrained essence, clearly indicating they were masters. Indeed, there were no mediocre individuals in the Phoenix Clan!\n\nWhen Yu Ruyan saw the two elders appear, she immediately stopped her conversation with Xi Lu. Feng Xu and Feng Kong also naturally saw her, and at the same time, they saw Feng Nu, Lan Chen, Long Ling, Xi Lu, and Nian Bing around.\n\nWhen the two elders saw Feng Nu and Nian Bing holding hands, their expressions changed slightly, and they stopped their steps.\n\nYu Ruyan stepped forward a few paces and stopped about five feet away from the two elders, respectfully bowing to them, \"Feng Yan, along with her daughter Lan Chen and Feng Nu, has come to attend the clan ceremony.\"\n\nFeng Xu said calmly, \"I thought you would not set foot on this land again. I didn't expect you to return after all. Are you returning solely to attend the clan ceremony?\"\n\nYu Ruyan sighed lightly and said, \"I'm sorry, Elder. I know the choice made back then caused you great pain, but I had to make that choice. Elder Feng Xu, I misunderstood you before. Thank you for raising my daughter into an adult. Although we were separated for twenty years, once I knew my daughter was still alive, all our past grievances are settled.\" Feng Xu not only played an important role in Yu Ruyan's upbringing, but he also had a nurturing kindness towards her daughter, Feng Nu. Although Feng Xu's actions led to the separation of mother and daughter for twenty years, Yu Ruyan had let go of all her hatred. Her return this time was solely to help the Phoenix Clan complete this ceremony.\n\nFeng Xu looked at Yu Ruyan with some surprise, then at Feng Nu beside her, and said, \"You know everything already?\"\n\nYu Ruyan nodded and said, \"Yes, Elder, you hid it from me so well!\"\n\nFeng Xu said coldly, \"If your daughter had truly died by my hand back then, you probably wouldn't be here today.\"\n\nYu Ruyan shook her head and said, \"No, even if Feng Nu had truly died in infancy, I would still have returned. I would first help the clan complete the ceremony, and then I would challenge you.\"\n\nFeng Kong, standing beside them, couldn't wait for Feng Xu to speak before interjecting, \"Everything must be in consideration of the greater good, Yan'er. You are indeed the once hopeful Phoenix of our clan. We didn't misjudge you. Good child, it's good that you're back, it's really good.\" As he spoke, he couldn't help but tug at Feng Xu's sleeve.",

    "content": "Feng Xu's face remained stern, and he said coldly, \"What's going on with them? You should know this is our clan's forbidden area. You and the Phoenix Girl have brought these outsiders here, openly disregarding clan rules. Is this your contribution to the clan?\" Although his words were directed at Yu Ruyan, they undeniably acknowledged her status as a member of the Phoenix Clan.\n\nYu Ruyan looked at the outwardly fierce but inwardly faltering Feng Xu, finding it somewhat amusing. Judging by Feng Kong's expression, the situation of the Phoenix Clan was clearly not optimistic. Yet, Elder Feng Xu was still putting on a show of being difficult about clan rules for her. This Elder Feng Xu was actually a respectable elder, but he was just too stubborn at times.\n\nYu Ruyan knew that the first issue she needed to face upon her return had been resolved. However, the second issue they needed to confront together was not as easy as the first. After all, she had grown up under the care of Feng Xu and Feng Kong, as had the Phoenix Girl. That sentiment would naturally play a crucial role when they returned to the Phoenix Clan. But this second issue concerned the very survival of the Phoenix Clan!\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Yu Ruyan decided to address the problem immediately. She knew that the longer it dragged on, the more disadvantageous it would be. To overcome this second hurdle, everyone needed to work together. With this thought, she looked up at the two elders and said, \"This time, I have not only brought back the Phoenix Girl but also my other daughter. This is Chen Chen.\" As she spoke, she beckoned Lan Chen. Lan Chen walked to her mother's side and stood there. Looking at the members of her mother's clan before her, she felt a turmoil within her.\n\nFeng Xu and Feng Kong's gazes fell upon Lan Chen. This girl, whose appearance was no less striking than the Phoenix Girl's, resembled Yu Ruyan even more than the Phoenix Girl. However, the cold, stern aura emanating from her made the two elders feel that something was amiss. Feng Kong couldn't help but say, \"Since this is your daughter, she must also possess the bloodline of our Phoenix Clan. What is the connection between bringing her back and bringing those outsiders?\"\n\nYu Ruyan sighed and nodded at Lan Chen.\n\nUnder everyone's gaze, a blue halo rose from Lan Chen. The halo drifted outwards, and the icy aura caused these fire-elemental Phoenix Clan members to frown. Just then, a clear phoenix cry came from Lan Chen's mouth. Huge blue wings appeared from behind her, and the beautiful Lan Chen, empowered by those magnificent royal Phoenix wings, floated into the air, suspended serenely in the atmosphere.\n\nFeng Xu and Feng Kong's eyes widened in unison, shocked. They exchanged a glance and said in trembling voices, \"Ice Phoenix.\" While the younger generation of the Phoenix Clan might not understand what an Ice Phoenix represented, how could the two surviving elders not? The hope that had just been rekindled in their hearts immediately plummeted, and their expressions towards Yu Ruyan changed.\n\nYu Ruyan sighed. \"Do the two elders understand now? I brought Chen Chen back to tell you this, so you can be prepared. As for those three outsiders, I had no choice but to bring them back. Because with their strength, they might be able to help us overcome this crisis. I hope the two elders can set aside clan prejudices and allow them to participate in our Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony.\"\n\nFeng Xu's gaze turned exceptionally cold. Feng Kong was about to speak but was stopped by a raised hand. \"Phoenix Clan members, surround them.\" In his ancient and deep voice, over a dozen Phoenix Clan experts swiftly occupied the most advantageous positions, releasing their Nine Li Battle Qi. Including Feng Ying, they all drew their swords. In the Phoenix Clan, an elder's word was law.\n\nFeng Xu looked at Yu Ruyan and said coldly, \"As the former 'Phoenix of Hope' in the clan, you surely understand what an Ice Phoenix represents. 'When the Ice Phoenix appears, the Phoenix ascends.' This saying signifies that the Phoenix Clan is on the brink of destruction. According to clan rules, whenever an Ice Phoenix appears, it must be destroyed immediately. In our clan's history, there have been three Ice Phoenixes, and for the sake of the Phoenix Clan's survival, all of them were executed according to clan rules without exception. Feng Yan, if you still consider yourself a member of this clan, you should know what to do.\"\n\nYu Ruyan's expression changed slightly. \"Elder, if you can spare the Phoenix Girl, can't you also spare my other daughter?\"\n\nFeng Xu looked at Yu Ruyan and sighed, saying, \"Yan'er, after all these years, I'm calling you this again. You don't understand, this time is different from that time. The appearance of the Ice Phoenix threatens the lives of thousands of our clan members. For the Phoenix Clan, I must act this way. Even if it means you won't help us overcome this crisis, I must make this choice.\"\n\nNian Bing strode forward, standing beside Yu Ruyan and Lan Chen, who was displaying her Ice Phoenix wings. \"Elder Feng Xu, could it be that the appearance of this Ice Phoenix isn't necessarily a bad thing? Perhaps the Ice Phoenix's appearance is also an opportunity for the Phoenix Clan.\"\n\nFeng Xu snorted coldly, \"Perhaps? Am I supposed to gamble the lives of thousands of our clan members on your 'perhaps'?\"\n\nNian Bing spoke with a casual tone, meeting Feng Xu's gaze. \"Elder, then do you think these dozen or so people can kill Chen Chen in front of us?\"\n\nFeng Xu looked coldly at Nian Bing. \"You overestimate our Phoenix Clan. With just a call from me, our clan can immediately deploy the Phoenix Wings Array composed of a thousand people. No matter how strong you are, you won't be able to escape. For the survival of our clan, I would rather let this Firewood Forest suffer a calamity.\"\n\n\"Grandfather, no. Perhaps he is right.\" Feng Ying suddenly flew to Feng Xu's side and whispered something in his ear. Although Nian Bing could hear his words through the Heavenly Eye acupoint's energy fluctuation detection, his language was unique to the Phoenix Clan.\n\nListening to Feng Ying's words, Feng Xu's expression changed slightly, and he said decisively, \"No, I cannot take that risk. Yan'er, what is your decision?\"\n\nYu Ruyan's gaze gradually turned cold. \"Elder Feng Xu, then I can only apologize. Chen Chen is my daughter. As a mother, how could I let my daughter die? Elder, the reason our Phoenix Clan is gradually declining is because we have received too little from the outside world. It is due to our closed-off nature that we have reached this current state. The Phoenix Wings Array is indeed our Phoenix Clan's most powerful formation, and its might, combined with the strength of a thousand people, is comparable to Divine Descent, but it is useless to us. Before the Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony is upon us, are you going to cause internal strife within our clan first?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Mom, you don't need to take the lead. You can't blame Elder Feng Xu. They have their difficulties. Perhaps if it were someone else, they wouldn't risk their entire clan for a mere possibility. Elder Feng Xu, I have a proposal.\"\n\nFeng Xu said in a deep voice, \"What proposal?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Since you have great confidence in your clan's Phoenix Wings Array, I would like to try it. If I can break through this array, it will prove that you have no power to stop us from leaving, and Chen Chen will not be killed by you. At that time, you will have no reason not to take the risk. We have come to the Phoenix Clan with the sincere intention of helping the Phoenix Clan overcome its difficulties. If I successfully break through the array, then I ask that you have the Phoenix Clan members temporarily leave the Firewood Forest. Let us and the elders face the Phoenix Nirvana Ceremony alone. This way, even if we fail, we will merely be changing our dwelling place.\"\n\nFeng Xu looked at Nian Bing with a hint of disdain. \"You? You intend to break through our clan's Phoenix Wings Array by yourself? I can agree to your proposal, but what happens if you lose?\"\n\nBefore Nian Bing could speak, Lan Chen's clear, cold voice rang out, \"If he loses, then I will take my own life here.\"\n\n\"Chen Chen,\" Yu Ruyan said urgently. Others might not know the power of the Phoenix Wings Array, but how could she not?\n\nLan Chen smiled slightly and said, \"Mom, don't you think this is the best solution? I don't want to make things difficult for you. I know you have never forgotten everything about the Phoenix Clan. Even Nian Bing is willing to risk himself for the future of the Phoenix Clan and for me. What do I have to fear? I have faith in Nian Bing; he will definitely be able to break through the formation.\"\n\n\"Brother, let me break through this formation with you,\" Xi Lu suddenly said.\n\nNian Bing shook his head. \"No, I will break through the Phoenix Wings Array myself.\" He certainly knew the dangers involved, but he absolutely could not let Xi Lu be involved. Xi Lu's martial arts were extremely overbearing. This time, he not only had to break through the formation but also avoid harming any of the Phoenix Clan members. Otherwise, even if he succeeded, he would incur the enmity of the Phoenix Clan. Therefore, everything had to rely on himself.\n\nRefusing Xi Lu, Nian Bing stepped forward and stood before Elder Feng Xu. \"Elder, as long as I can break out of the Phoenix Wings Array, is that sufficient?\"\n\nFeng Xu said proudly, \"Of course. If you can truly break out of the formation, it will prove you have the ability to break it. I must warn you in advance: once the formation is deployed, the only outcome for the person within who cannot break out is death.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Very well, I understand. Please order your men to deploy the formation.\"\n\nFeng Xu took out a red flute from his embrace and placed it to his lips, blowing a sharp, clear note that drifted through the air with various modulations. Beside him, Feng Kong gave Feng Ying a look and said, \"You will be in charge of the formation.\"\n\nFeng Ying responded with a nod and his gaze fell on Nian Bing. \"Perhaps this is another kind of competition between you and me. Although it is unfair, I want to see how strong you truly are.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"You will see.\" With that, he walked back and sat down cross-legged, sensing the dense innate Qi in the air and beginning to regulate his breathing.\n\nAt this moment, a faint, ethereal voice entered Nian Bing's ears. \"Maintain your posture and do not move. Listen to me. The Phoenix Wings Array is our Phoenix Clan's most powerful formation, and also the strongest joint attack formation. Its power is such that even the Continental's strongest Flame Dragon Knights might not be able to resist it. The greatest feature of this formation is its ability to unite our Phoenix Clan's unique Nine Li Battle Qi. The combined Battle Qi of thousands of people unleashed together produces an effect similar to fire magic. As for how powerful it is, even I haven't seen it, but one can imagine that once the formation is deployed, its power will be no less than Fire Element Divine Descent. The power of the formation is determined by the overall strength of the thousand people within it. The fact that the two elders are not participating now is already a show of mercy towards us. If you want to break this formation, you need to break it from a single point. I hope you understand what I mean. Mom doesn't ask for anything else; you must come out of the formation alive, for your own sake and for Chen Chen's.\" Yu Ruyan's voice carried a hint of heaviness. She hoped Nian Bing could successfully break the formation, but she also did not want her own clansmen to suffer any harm. However, the method of \"breaking from a single point\" required breaking out from the encirclement, and how could that be achieved there?\n\nNian Bing sat cross-legged without moving. The middle-stage Xijing acupoint caused the surrounding innate Qi to continuously merge with his body. Every trace of magical element fluctuation appeared in Nian Bing's perception without omission. A formation of Divine Descent level? Very well, let me experience it.\n\nRed clouds, a stretch of red clouds appeared in the sky above the Firewood Forest. If one could see clearly, they would realize that the patch of red clouds was composed of people radiating red Battle Qi. There were forty rows, with twenty-five people in the first row. The person at the very top unfurled the Phoenix Clan's royal wings, and below him, one after another, they held onto the feet of the person above, suspending themselves in mid-air.\n\nAt first glance, one person carrying the weight of twenty-four others seemed incredible. However, these Phoenix Clan experts had cultivated Nine Li Battle Qi for a long time, and their individual strength was great. Under the influence of Battle Qi, they could make their bodies as light as swallows. Although they could not fly due to the lack of wings, they could minimize their weight to the greatest extent. Therefore, the force that the forty flying Phoenix Clan members with royal wings needed to bear was actually not that great.\n\nSeeing the sky filled with red Battle Qi, Yu Ruyan's expression changed. She hadn't expected that after her years away, so many experts with royal wings would have appeared in the Phoenix Clan. While possessing royal wings didn't necessarily mean Martial Saint level strength, it was enough to prove that the Phoenix Wings Array before them was the strongest formation the Phoenix Clan could deploy.\n\nNian Bing stood up from the ground, casually brushing off the dust from his body, his expression as relaxed as ever, seemingly unfazed by the thousand elite Phoenix Clan members in the sky.",

    "content": "Feng Xu looked at Nian Bing and said, \"It's not too late to regret it now. Over the years, we have carefully studied the Nine Transformations of the Phoenix. We have discovered that the first two transformations of the Nine Transformations of the Phoenix can be triggered by special techniques. In a short period, those with the royal bloodline of the Phoenix clan can reach the second transformation. Although their strength is far inferior to the Phoenix Maiden, with the combined power of a thousand people, do you think you still have a chance?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"How will I know if I can't try? Even Chen Chen has confidence in me, so how could I possibly back down?\"\n\nFeng Xu looked at the young man before him. He didn't quite understand where the young man's confidence came from. Although Feng Ying had already told him that he had lost to Nian Bing, how could one Feng Ying compare to the Phoenix Wings Array composed of the entire Phoenix elite? From the beginning, Feng Xu had no intention of letting Nian Bing actually break the array. He had set up this strongest Phoenix Wings Array not only to intimidate Nian Bing but, more importantly, to show Yu Ruyan that the Phoenix clan indeed had the strength to keep them here.\n\n\"Alright, I'll have them come down and begin.\" Feng Xu's eyes were somewhat cold. The life and death of an outsider meant nothing to him.\n\nYu Ruyan, Xi Lu, Phoenix Maiden, Lan Chen, and Long Ling all came to Nian Bing's side. Five people, ten pairs of eyes were focused on him. Nian Bing said nothing, merely looked at them with a determined gaze. After looking around, he said to Feng Xu, \"Elder, I don't think you need to have them come down. Since it's the Phoenix Wings Array, let's perform it in the air. That way, it won't damage this beautiful primeval forest.\"\n\nFeng Xu looked at Nian Bing with some surprise. His words gained him some favor. He nodded and blew a note with the flute in his hand. The thousand Phoenix clan members, who were about to descend, resumed their previous positions. Just as Feng Xu and Feng Kong thought Nian Bing would use magic to ascend into the air, Nian Bing let out a long chant.\n\nThe clear chanting sound shot straight up to the heavens. He stomped his feet on the ground and suddenly leaped up. Feng Xu and Feng Kong, who had practiced martial arts for many years, could clearly sense that this was not magic, but the power of the human body. Yet, he leaped so high. Seeing Nian Bing's body rise to ten zhang and still continue to ascend, both of them had the same thought: was this person not only a magician but also a warrior?\n\nNian Bing answered them with his actions. Just as his body was about to reach its limit, gray light spots condensed beneath him. A resonant dragon's roar merged with Nian Bing's chanting, soaring into the sky. His momentum instantly surged, not at all inferior to the Phoenix Wings Array in the air, which was beginning to transform, filled with Nine Li Battle Qi.\n\nUnder the stunned gaze of Feng Xu and Feng Kong, Oscar, a gray dragon seven zhang long, suddenly appeared beneath Nian Bing. As Nian Bing's body began to descend, he sat steadily on Oscar's back. The chanting of man and dragon ceased simultaneously. Oscar's enormous dragon wings suddenly spread, carrying Nian Bing soaring into the sky, targeting the center of the Phoenix Wings Array.\n\nFeng Xu's expression changed and he said, \"A dragon? He can actually command a dragon.\"\n\nThe Phoenix Maiden shook her head and said, \"No, that is his friend, and his companion. Or, you could say, a part of his body.\"\n\nNo matter what happened, no matter how surprised the Phoenix clan members in the air were, the Phoenix Wings Array suddenly exploded when Nian Bing reached the center of those forty rows of Phoenix clan people.\n\nThe pervasive red battle qi truly turned the sky into a red ocean, like burning clouds, instantly engulfing Nian Bing's body. Only those who truly faced it could feel how powerful the combined battle qi of a thousand Phoenix warriors was. Even Yu Ruyan and the others standing on the ground could clearly feel the scorching heat continuously emanating from the sky.\n\nThe sound of phoenix cries echoed in the air. The battle between the Dragon Mage and the Phoenix Wings Array had begun.\n\nThe voices of a thousand people speaking simultaneously were as synchronized as one person speaking. With golden flames forming the phoenix and red flames forming the body, the Phoenix Wings Array began to operate. The massive Nine Li Battle Qi transformed into nine giant fire phoenixes in the air, charging towards Nian Bing almost at the same time within the vast red clouds.\n\nAt this moment, Nian Bing sat steadily on Oscar's back. Seven divine magical blades appeared almost simultaneously. Feng Xu and Feng Kong did not notice that when Yu Ruyan and the others surrounded Nian Bing earlier, Xi Lu, who was also transferred to the center, had undergone a significant change in his body because he had returned the Long Sheng Saber to Nian Bing.\n\nThe immense pressure seemed to crush him and Oscar. The scorching air made him feel like he was in a furnace. The surrounding magic elements became extremely weak in front of the nine fire phoenixes that expanded instantaneously. Only the fire element erupted with surging power. The strength of a thousand people was indeed formidable. The attack power unleashed by those nine fire phoenixes instantly was something that even an Ice Goddess Priest would find difficult to contend with. However, although Nian Bing was not an Ice Goddess Priest, and he wasn't confident he could defeat an Ice Goddess Priest, he was a mage with both ice and fire origins, a Dragon Mage, and he had his own methods.\n\nThe opening of the fourth acupoint gave Nian Bing a completely new feeling regarding the use of acupoints. Although he only had one day to adapt to the appearance of the Xijing acupoint, compared to when he ambushed Xilun a few days ago, he had already changed again. His most precious wealth was not the seven divine blades floating around his body, nor the vast and profound magical power within him, but his mental strength, which he unleashed with all his might.\n\nIf it were someone else caught in such a pincer attack, and they were not a fire-element mage, they probably wouldn't be able to exert even ten percent of their strength. However, Nian Bing was different. Through the vast mental strength contained within the Tianyan acupoint and the opened Xijing acupoint, he had communicated with the surging primordial qi of heaven and earth at the moment before he charged into the air. No matter how strong the Phoenix Wings Array was, it would still have flaws, and enough flaws for his mental strength to break through. Therefore, the moment Nian Bing entered this array, the final outcome was already determined.\n\nThe nine giant fire phoenixes, fire phoenixes completely condensed from battle qi, had blocked all possible escape routes for Nian Bing. At this very moment, the seven divine blades around Nian Bing's body lit up. Seven substantial figures of will floated in mid-air as if they had no weight, floating around Nian Bing's body. The sabers in their hands emitted brilliant light, and for a time, the dazzling radiance shot out from the fire clouds, piercing through heaven and earth. The power of divine artifacts was displayed at this moment. Nian Bing placed one hand on his lower abdomen, pointed the other hand diagonally towards the sky, and after a flash of golden light in his eyebrows, seven-colored light dispersed from a single point. Merging with the surrounding blade light, it instantly formed a giant seven-colored vortex. The vortex formed by the strong light instantly expanded, almost in the blink of an eye, completely engulfing the nine giant fire phoenixes.\n\nAt this moment, the sky above Huomu Forest was as if covered by a rainbow, except that it was not the seven colors of a rainbow, but the blue, red, yellow, green, silver, white, and black colors representing ice, fire, earth, wind, space, light, and darkness. Under the effect of the intense light, the nine fire phoenixes condensed by the Phoenix Wings Array suddenly changed. Their size was almost halved in an instant, and their forward speed also slowed down to one-third of their previous speed.\n\nLooking at the blue sky that reappeared, looking at the red clouds that melted like ice and snow, Nian Bing smiled. The seven puppet figures, each holding a divine saber, simultaneously raised their divine sabers high. With a shout from Nian Bing's mouth, a circle of golden-gray light emanated from Oscar's body. The light penetrated directly into the bodies of the seven puppet figures. The next moment, seven beams of light shot into the sky. The light representing the seven magic elements condensed into a single point above Nian Bing's head, a seven-colored point of light. That point of light seemed very small, so small it was almost imperceptible, but it also seemed very large, so large it could encompass heaven and earth.\n\nAt this moment, Nian Bing, standing on Oscar's back, was like a true god descending to earth. He pointed his right index finger at that seven-colored point of light. His heart suddenly became fiery, and even Yu Ruyan and the others on the ground seemed to be able to see the faint smile on his face. It was as if what was before him was not an array that could take his life at any moment, but a game.\n\nNian Bing's index finger moved slightly, gently pushing that point of light upwards. Immediately after, seven streams of colorful light shot back into the seven puppet figures. Almost everyone could see that seven streams of light, like divine chains, descended from the sky, directly landing on the seven puppet figures. The seven Nian Bings with completely different auras instantly became illusory. Then, the sabers in their hands disappeared simultaneously and merged into their bodies. In the light emanating from the sky, their illusory bodies instantly expanded, and each puppet figure underwent a change.\n\nFrom the front, their appearances could no longer be clearly seen. Although their bodies had grown larger, their appearances had become increasingly blurred. Nian Bing smiled, standing on Oscar's back, watching the nine fire phoenixes, which had shrunk by half, gradually charge towards him, but without showing a trace of worry.\n\nThe women in front were somewhat confused. When the charging speed of the nine fire phoenixes suddenly slowed down, and the red cloud formed by the Nine Li Battle Qi had been dispelled by the seven-colored light, Nian Bing could have easily used Oscar's speed to charge out. Although this would be a bit of a trick, it could still be considered breaking the array. After all, to instantly weaken the attack power of nine fire phoenixes formed by a thousand people by half and greatly reduce their forward speed required immense power! However, why didn't Nian Bing do that? Only Lan Chen truly understood Nian Bing's thoughts.\n\nLan Chen's eyes were moist. Looking at the seven expanding light figures, she no longer cared about anything else. At this moment, her heart was filled only with Nian Bing, who was willing to give everything for her, her husband who was willing to exhaust his immense power for her. In fact, as early as when Nian Bing used Tears of the Angel, she had already understood that a man who could even sacrifice his life was worthy of her love. That was why she had resolutely decided to leave the Ice God Tower and become Nian Bing's true wife.\n\nAlthough it sounds slow, from the moment Nian Bing ascended with Oscar's support to the expansion of the seven light figures, only a few blinks of an eye had passed. At this moment, the seven light figures, which had expanded to three zhang, had already shown different changes. This time, the changes truly astonished everyone.\n\nThe changes were almost simultaneous. The blue puppet figure's body changed. It was no longer Nian Bing's appearance. A blue flowing dress formed by blue light shadows appeared around the illusory blue body. Although it couldn't be seen clearly, the blue puppet figure had indeed become a woman. A scepter, five zhang long, appeared in her right hand. On her chest, a ball of blue light shone. Facing outwards, she raised the long scepter in her hand.\n\nThe red figure also changed, but instead of becoming a woman, he became like a mighty general. A phantom fiery red armor appeared on his body. His body, three zhang and four chi tall, clasped his hands together, raising a saber made of flames.\n\nThe green figure was also covered in armor, but unlike the red figure, his body appeared much thinner. Swirling light winds revolved around his body. The leaves, like wind blades, were semi-transparent and covered his body. He held a bottle in his hand, with the mouth facing outwards, as if about to pour something out.\n\nThe yellow figure underwent the biggest change. Not only did he change from male to female, like the blue puppet figure, but he also gained a long dress. At the same time, the yellow light around his original body turned green, a vibrant green full of life. In his hand, he held a light strip like a willow branch, with seven green willow leaves glistening vibrantly on the light strip.\n\nThe silver figure remained male, but he was not wearing armor. A silver robe flickered continuously. His body went through a process of appearing from nothingness. Each time it flickered, the silver light seemed to become brighter. In front of him floated a gate, not yet opened. The magnificent gate was also silver, engraved with countless intricate symbols. However, since all of this was composed of energy and was illusory, no one could clearly see what those symbols were.\n\nThe white figure had now transformed into a sacred golden color. A luxurious golden robe was worn by a beautiful woman with golden hair. Her three-zhang-tall body looked so slender. She looked up at the sky, holding a golden long sword in her hand. The light shining on the sword was as dazzling as the sun. The sacred aura made the air seem sanctified.",

    "content": "The last figure, the black silhouette, was so familiar: the long black trench coat, the tall and sturdy build, and the giant scythe extending five zhang, all of which had appeared several times before. The massive scythe was now held high in a clasped grip.\n\nSeven figures, each with a different manifestation, yet exuding the same aura. Only one word could describe the scene: power. Beneath each of them was a corresponding six-pointed star of the same color.\n\nThe seven figures, completely centered around Nian Bing, raised their weapons outwards. Though they were illusory, they appeared so real. Protected by these seven towering figures, each three zhang tall, the seven-colored light on Nian Bing's forehead seemed to have reached its limit. A condensed white light emanated from his left hand, shielding his abdomen. As the seven colossal figures fully formed, the seven streams of colored light drifting down from the sky vanished. However, everything at this moment was unfolding precisely according to Nian Bing's will.\n\nEveryone facing them was stunned. What was this? What did these seven figures represent? Some could recognize one, others could recognize two. But recognizing just one was enough to infer what the other six represented. This included Fenghuang Nü, Long Ling, Lan Chen, as well as Xiluo and Yu Ruyan. None of them had expected Nian Bing's power to have reached such a level. Gazing at the scene unfolding in the sky, those seven bodies, each three zhang tall, they realized then that Nian Bing was no longer an ordinary person. Even describing him as a god seemed not an exaggeration.\n\nNian Bing spoke, his voice calm, yet emanating from all seven figures simultaneously.\n\nThe blue figure chanted, \"The Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess brings the Staff of the Ice and Snow Goddess.\"\n\nThe red figure chanted, \"The Roar of the Fire God brings the Battle Blade of the Fire God.\"\n\nThe green figure chanted, \"The Whispers of the Free Wind bring the Whirlwind of the Wind God's Bottle.\"\n\nThe green figure chanted, \"The Melody of the Awakening Earth brings the Forgiveness of the Earth Goddess.\"\n\nThe silver figure chanted, \"The Hexagram of a Thousand Transformations brings the Door of Chaos of the Space God.\"\n\nThe golden figure chanted, \"The Dawn that Pierces Heaven and Earth brings the Holy Sword of the Light Goddess.\"\n\nThe black figure chanted, \"The Curse of Eternal Hell brings the Scythe of the Death God.\"\n\nNine Fire Phoenixes, each weakened by half, arrived within one zhang of the seven colossal, three-zhang-tall light projections, but they suddenly halted. The nine massive, fiery red figures seemed to tremble, trembling before the immense aura before them. No one knew why this was happening, but Nian Bing's voice echoed from the center of the seven colossal figures.\n\n\"Release it, the Seven Banishments, Seven Annihilations Curse.\"\n\nThese simple eight characters commanded the seven colossal figures to move. The Ice and Snow Goddess's Staff in the blue-robed woman's hand pointed forward. The Fire God's Battle Blade in the red warrior's hand slashed out. The bottle in the green figure's hand released a mass of pure green wind that seemed both solidified and swirling. The seven leaves on the willow branch in the green figure's hand suddenly detached from the main stem. The silver figure pulled open the door before him. The Holy Sword in the golden figure's hand shot out ten thousand rays of light. The black figure brought up the scythe, representing the god of death, with both hands.\n\nTime seemed to stand still. Not even the thousand elite Phoenix tribe members appearing around them in the sky could forget the scene unfolding before their eyes. The Phoenix Wing Array, condensed with the vast battle energy of the thousand elite Phoenix tribe members, completely vanished as the seven colossal figures unleashed their power simultaneously.\n\nThe nine Fire Phoenixes, within the seven-colored halo, did not even have a chance to struggle before they dissolved into specks of light, eventually being absorbed into the silver door. Everything ended. It was as if nothing had happened. The simple Seven Banishments, Seven Annihilations Curse represented the simultaneous casting of seven forbidden spells! Even the main gods on the continent of gods could not simultaneously wield seven forbidden spells of different elements at the eleventh tier. Yet, Nian Bing had achieved it. The true power of these seven forbidden spells, unleashed simultaneously, was felt only by Xiluo below.\n\nThe gap between the eleventh and twelfth tiers was originally insurmountable. However, these seven fully integrated forbidden spells, at the moment of their simultaneous explosion, not only reached the level of a twelfth-tier Divine Descent spell but also soared to the thirteenth tier. At this moment, Xiluo no longer doubted that Nian Bing had become a god-level master, possibly the first human god-level master on the Continent of Brightness.\n\nThe nine Fire Phoenixes completely disappeared. The thousand elite Phoenix tribe members felt a simultaneous tightness in their chests. The forty strongest Phoenix tribe members, who possessed royal feathers, had their royal feathers on their backs vanish simultaneously. Under the influence of the qi connection and after expending all their battle energy, the thousand Phoenix tribe members floating in the air could no longer control their bodies.\n\nFeng Xu's expression changed, and Feng Kong's expression also changed. Their bodies flickered almost simultaneously, but their hearts were filled with sorrow. No matter how strong they were, they were only two people. How could they possibly save all thousand tribesmen falling from the sky at the same time? Just as their hearts sank into despair, a vast expanse of green light suddenly floated in mid-air. The green light permeated the entire sky, enveloping every Phoenix tribe member falling from the sky.\n\nThe vast green light disappeared, but beneath each Phoenix tribe member, a patch of green light floated. What was that? It was a common third-tier Levitation spell from the wind element, easily cast even by an intermediate mage. However, these levitation spells had now become life-saving treasures. Nian Bing's body seemed to turn green as well. Oscar's wings retracted, and he descended from the sky.\n\nFeng Xu and Feng Kong were stunned once again. Casting over a thousand Levitation spells simultaneously, and after having simultaneously cast seven forbidden spells, Nian Bing was truly no longer someone they could describe as human in their eyes. Their hearts trembled. It was only after the thousand tribesmen landed safely on the ground that their suspended hearts returned to their places.\n\nA simple battle, the total time not exceeding half a meal. Yet, it had completely changed the perception of the Phoenix tribe members. After landing, Feng Ying turned and walked towards his own home within the Phoenix tribe. He knew that in his lifetime, he would never be able to challenge this love rival.\n\nA simple battle, and Nian Bing had won. The price of victory was merely that the thousand Phoenix tribe members had consumed a large amount of battle energy. However, not a single one of the thousand Phoenix tribe members who attacked Nian Bing simultaneously suffered any damage.\n\nEven the youngest and most foolish Phoenix tribe member present could understand, after the nine Fire Phoenixes disappeared and saw the seven colossal figures still existing, that it would only take a wave of Nian Bing's hand to take their lives. Yet, he had not done so. After the nine Fire Phoenixes disappeared and as they were falling from the sky, the seven colossal figures turned back into seven blades with a casual wave of Nian Bing's hand and reintegrated into his body. Immediately afterward, the thousand Levitation spells that saved their lives appeared.\n\nWhen Nian Bing landed, Oscar had already disappeared. Nian Bing's complexion was slightly pale, but the smile on his face remained unchanged. He landed directly in front of Lan Chen, opened his arms, and embraced her trembling delicate body. \"Chen Chen, I haven't disappointed you. I did it.\"\n\nLan Chen clung tightly to Nian Bing's embrace. \"If your Seven Banishments, Seven Annihilations Curse couldn't deal with the Phoenix Wing Array just now, what would you have done?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said with ease, \"I don't know. I had two choices: one was to use the Life Curse again, and the other was to detonate one of my acupoints.\" He spoke lightly, but everyone nearby heard him. The meaning behind these casual words was so heavy.\n\n\"I understand,\" Lan Chen's voice was very calm, but she clung to Nian Bing very, very tightly.\n\nThe thousand Phoenix tribe warriors retreated silently, and the heat in the air gradually dissipated. The sky returned to a clear blue, and the volatile magical elements gradually stabilized.\n\nLan Chen embraced Nian Bing's body. She could feel that Nian Bing's body weight was almost entirely supported by her. Nian Bing hugged her quietly without moving, but the innate qi and magical elements in the air were surging rapidly towards his body. The magic he had just cast not only required extremely high control of magic power and external innate qi but also placed an unprecedented burden on his mental power. To control the simultaneous detonation of seven forbidden spells without harming anyone required a level of mental control that was almost astonishing. Not only did he achieve this, but after the seven forbidden spells concluded, he also simultaneously cast a thousand Levitation spells, accurately appearing beneath each Phoenix tribe member, safely bringing them to the ground. Nian Bing's body was now extremely depleted. Even so, after landing, with the protection of others, he immediately helped Xiluo restore the appearance of his Long Life Saber. If not for the newly opened Western Meridian Acupoint allowing him to draw upon innate qi for the magic attack, the instantaneous thirteenth-tier power would have been impossible. With Nian Bing's strength, breaking through the Phoenix Wing Array was not necessary in such a manner. However, to create complete deterrence for the Phoenix tribe, to make them completely abandon the idea of killing Lan Chen, he had to do this.\n\nFeng Xu and Feng Kong appeared and stood behind Nian Bing. Feng Xu's gaze was complex. The unfathomable depth of the young man before him gave him a strong shock. He had never imagined that there could be someone in this world who could deal with the Phoenix tribe's Phoenix Wing Array in this way. Nian Bing did not break through the array; instead, he completely dismantled it. Destroying the Phoenix tribe would not be difficult for him. Even if he and Feng Kong presided over the array, the result would be no different. What was even more valuable was that after dismantling the array, he had not harmed a single one of his tribesmen. Nian Bing had proven through his actions that their arrival this time was indeed to help the Phoenix tribe. Although Feng Xu was somewhat unwilling to admit that this was true, he still uttered with some difficulty, \"Thank you.\"\n\nNian Bing released his arms around Lan Chen. In this short period, his mental power had recovered somewhat, and he showed no outward signs of weakness. He turned to face Feng Xu and said, \"Elder, there's no need for politeness. As long as you remember the bet between us. I am indeed an outsider and should not interfere in the internal affairs of the Phoenix tribe. However, I hope to make my own contributions to deal with the imminent tribulation facing the Phoenix tribe. To be frank, I am not doing this for the Phoenix tribe, but for Feng Nü, for Chen Chen, and for my mother.\"\n\nFeng Xu sighed and said nothing further. He turned and walked into the depths of the Fire-Wood Forest. Feng Kong said, \"Come, follow me.\"\n\nYu Ruyan walked to Nian Bing's side and took his hand. A gentle and warm stream of battle qi was injected into Nian Bing's body, nourishing his meridians. Nian Bing smiled slightly and nodded at Yu Ruyan, indicating he was fine. Only then did everyone follow the two elders towards the true dwelling place of the Phoenix tribe.\n\nAfter they passed through a dense forest, the giant volcano finally appeared before them. In fact, Nian Bing had already seen the volcano from the air when he was breaking the array. Now, the volcano appeared even more vivid. Looking up from below, the volcano was at least nearly a thousand zhang tall, but there were no clouds encircling its summit. The flat, as if chiseled by a knife, mountaintop could be clearly seen. The trees of the primeval forest changed from being diverse to being singular. Large areas of paulownia forests appeared before everyone. Within the paulownia forest, there was a stone-paved path about a zhang wide, extending into the forest. The temperature here was noticeably higher than in the previous forest, and warm air currents nourished the bodies of Nian Bing and the others. Yu Ruyan's eyes became moist. After many years apart, she had finally returned to her homeland.\n\nFollowing the stone-paved path, after about the time it takes to eat a meal, a simple village appeared before them. There were several fields surrounding the village, and some Phoenix tribe members were diligently cultivating them. The wooden houses within the village looked very neat, arranged in an orderly fashion. Thousands of wooden houses were arranged in a strip around the foot of the volcano. Led by Feng Xu and Feng Kong, everyone walked into the village. Wherever they passed, the Phoenix tribe members they encountered respectfully saluted the two elders and cast curious glances at Nian Bing and the others.\n\n\"Ah! Isn't this Feng Nü? Girl, you're back.\" An aged voice rang out. An elderly Phoenix tribe member called out to Feng Nü from in front of his house.\n\nFeng Nü hurried forward and respectfully said, \"Grandpa Song, how are you? It's been a long time. You still have so much spirit.\"",

    "content": "The old man chuckled, \"No, no, I'm old, old. Little girl, I haven't seen you in so long, Grandpa really misses you! What, is your external training over? Or did you come back specifically for the grand ceremony? You're not leaving this time, are you? While you were away, I often heard that little hawk, Xing, mentioning you. He's happy now. You're all grown up, it's time to arrange your marriage soon.\"\n\nThe Phoenix Goddess looked a bit awkward, unsure how to answer. At that moment, Yu Ru Yan arrived beside her, \"Uncle Du, do you still recognize me?\" Her voice trembled slightly as she stepped forward and took the old man's hand.\n\nFeng Du peered closely with his dim, old eyes at Yu Ru Yan's slightly excited face. He showed a look of thought, then suddenly, surprise flickered in his eyes, \"Ah! You, are you Xiao Yan?\"\n\n\"It's me! Uncle Song.\" Tears streamed down Yu Ru Yan's face. Seeing her clansmen again, seeing this uncle who watched her grow, her heart trembled. Intense emotions erupted as she tightly gripped the old man's hand.\n\nFeng Song's body trembled with excitement. \"Xiao Yan, it's actually Xiao Yan who's back! I heard Feng Kong say you were already dead. Girl, you caused quite a stir back then!\"\n\nYu Ru Yan, with tear-filled eyes, said, \"No, I'm not dead. Uncle Song, I...\"\n\nFeng Song smiled, \"Alright, it's good that you're back. Let the past be the past. Who's to say who was right or wrong? Feng Xu, Feng Kong, you are not allowed to trouble Xiao Yan, do you hear me?\" Feng Xu's expression remained somewhat somber, but he nodded. \"Big brother, don't worry. We won't make things difficult for her. Please rest well and take care of yourself.\"\n\nFeng Song patted Yu Ru Yan's hand and said, \"Alright, you all go. Just come visit this old man when you have time.\"\n\nWhile Yu Ru Yan and Feng Song were talking, the Phoenix Goddess quietly told Nian Bing that among the five great elders of the Phoenix clan, Yu Ru Yan's father, who was her maternal grandfather, was the first. Elder Feng Song ranked second, followed by Feng Xu, Feng Kong, and another elder. During a battle with external enemies, the fifth-ranked elder died, and Elder Feng Song was severely injured. Although he saved his life, he lost the battle qi he had cultivated for many years, which is why he appeared so frail. Even so, Elder Feng Song held a high position within the Phoenix clan. He insisted on not serving as an elder anymore, so Feng Xu and Feng Kong moved up one rank to second and third, respectively. To commemorate Yu Ru Yan's deceased father, the title of First Elder remained reserved.\n\nAfter bidding farewell to Feng Song, led by Feng Xu and Feng Kong, they arrived at a large house in the center of the Phoenix village, which served as the place for Phoenix clan discussions. The interior of the wooden house was simple, with ten-foot rattan chairs placed on both sides. In the front center were two chairs. Feng Xu and Feng Kong walked to the innermost seats and sat down, signaling Nian Bing and the others to be seated.\n\nFeng Xu's expression softened slightly. Looking at Nian Bing, Yu Ru Yan, and the others, he said, \"The Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony is a top priority for our clan. In all the years of the Phoenix clan's legacy, this is the first time an outsider will participate. Since you insist on protecting Bing Feng, what suggestions do you have?\" Yu Ru Yan said, \"Elder Feng Xu, as Nian Bing previously mentioned, the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony this time, due to Chen Chen's Bing Feng body, might trigger the eruption of the Phoenix True Fire from the Phoenix Volcano. As Nian Bing said, let's have our clansmen temporarily withdraw from the Wutong Forest and return after the ceremony. Before returning, I also carefully considered it. The six characters 'Bing Feng appears, Phoenix ascends' signify the precursor to the eruption of the Phoenix True Fire according to our clan's ancient texts. However, no one knows if this is good or bad. You are now the Chief Elder of our clan, so can we thoroughly check the records in our clan's ancient texts, perhaps to find some clues?\"\n\nFeng Xu shook his head. \"As an elder of the Phoenix clan, I have long memorized our clan's ancient texts. There are only those six characters recorded about Bing Feng, which is why I insist on following the clan rules. I must admit that we currently lack the ability to fulfill the clan rules. Facing the upcoming grand ceremony, all we can do is do our best to prevent any damage to our homeland caused by the eruption of the Phoenix Volcano. According to clan records, the Phoenix Volcano represents the rise and fall of our Phoenix clan. Our ancestors, the great Phoenixes, perished in this volcano. Therefore, this is the Phoenix clan's only land of hope, and it can never change. If the volcano erupts and destroys the entire forest this time, it will signify the demise of the Phoenix clan.\"\n\nHis words were heavy, and everyone present could understand the gravity of his meaning. Although he had lost the bet, this elder was reluctant to face the Phoenix True Fire. Yu Ru Yan said decisively, \"In that case, please rest assured, elders. Unless Feng Yan dies, we will absolutely not allow the Phoenix True Fire to harm our homeland of tens of thousands of years.\" Feng Xu sighed, \"If you can help our clan safely pass the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony this time, I can make an exception and allow you, Feng Nü, and even your other daughter to return to the Phoenix clan. But you must understand, if we fail, you will become sinners of the Phoenix clan. Yan'er, it's not too late to change your mind. For the survival of the Phoenix clan, sacrifice is the best choice.\"\n\nYu Ru Yan smiled, first looking at Nian Bing. \"Elder, if it were Feng Yan who had never left the Phoenix clan, perhaps she would have made that choice. However, having lived outside for so many years, there is nothing more important to me than family. Moreover, as the saying goes, a wife follows her husband. Chen Chen and Feng are already Nian Bing's wives. Even if I agreed, would he?\"\n\nThe gazes of both elders fell on Nian Bing. Nian Bing did not need to answer. They naturally knew the answer. From his previous Seven Forbidden Artifacts and Ultimate Curses, they understood that killing Lan Chen was absolutely impossible. Moreover, Nian Bing's mercy earlier had already given them enough face. If they insisted on killing Lan Chen, the Phoenix True Fire might not have appeared yet, and the Phoenix clan would have been destroyed by this unfathomable Dragon Mage. Besides, there was Yu Ru Yan, who could already be called the strongest expert of the Phoenix clan, and Feng Nü, the hope of the Phoenix clan.\n\nNian Bing said, \"I'm afraid none of you elders have ever seen what the Phoenix True Fire looks like. Since there has never been an eruption of Phoenix True Fire caused by Bing Feng, we must try. Mother is right. As long as I am here, I will not allow anyone to harm my beloved. Just as the survival of the Phoenix clan is the most important thing to you elders, my wife is equally important to me.\" Feng Xu nodded. For the first time, he felt that the decision he had made was so helpless. \"There are still twenty days until the eruption of the Phoenix Volcano. At that time, I will risk my old life and try it with you. Feng Kong, in ten days, lead our clansmen to withdraw from the Wutong Forest and await my news. If the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony is successfully completed, you can bring the clansmen back. Otherwise, you will have to find another place to be the resting place for our clansmen. The future of the Phoenix clan is entrusted to you.\"\n\nFeng Kong said anxiously, \"Second brother, how can this be? As an elder of the Phoenix clan, how can I not participate in the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony? I want to stay and participate in this ceremony with you.\" Feng Xu said angrily, \"Nonsense! The future of the Phoenix clan is the most important thing. If there is no elder to lead, our clansmen will only fall apart. Feng Kong, can't you distinguish between what is important and what is not? This is an order. As the Chief Elder of our clan, this is my command to you.\"\n\nFeng Kong looked at Feng Xu dazedly. Feng Xu was also looking at him. After so many years as brothers, how could he not understand his second brother's intentions? A bitter smile appeared on his face, and he said with great difficulty, \"Yes, Feng Kong obeys. Second brother, I believe everything will be successful. Heaven will not let my Phoenix clan decline like this.\"\n\nLooking at the somber expressions of Yu Ru Yan, Feng Nü, and the two elders of the Phoenix clan, Nian Bing deeply felt the immense responsibility he carried. He said nothing more; only practical actions could prove everything. Nian Bing and the others were arranged to stay in the Phoenix village. Surprisingly, during these twenty days of waiting, Nian Bing did not indulge in intimacy with any of his wives, and even the time he spent with them became very limited. He and Dao Lu shared a room, and for two hours each day, they were almost entirely in cultivation. What could be done in a mere twenty days? Nian Bing did not know either, but he understood that every bit of strength he gained would increase his chances when facing the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony.\n\nTwenty days passed in the blink of an eye. Lan Chen sat cross-legged on her bed, meditating. Since seven days ago, her body had begun to feel a strange sensation. The ice magic power within her was like boiling water, often fluctuating unstably. Her internal energy had also become very unstable, and various emotions arose for no reason. Feng Nü, sharing a room with her, would help her sister stabilize her internal energy whenever Lan Chen's body felt unusual. Feng Nü noticed that Lan Chen's ice magic power seemed different than before, as if something had been added, but she couldn't quite explain what that something was. The twenty days had arrived, and according to the Phoenix clan's ancient texts, today was the day the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony would be held.\n\nTen days earlier, Feng Kong had led all the Phoenix clansmen away from the village where they had lived for countless years. As Feng Kong was leaving, he tightly grasped Yu Ru Yan's hand. Although he said nothing, how could Yu Ru Yan not understand his meaning? This was the homeland of the Phoenix clan. Leaving this habitat filled with pure fire elements, the Phoenix clan could no longer produce powerful warriors. This Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony, as the two elders had said, would determine the survival of the Phoenix clan. Yu Ru Yan had made all the necessary preparations, knowing what she had to do.\n\nThe Wutong Forest became unusually quiet, as if all the creatures in the forest had vanished into thin air. The ground vibrated slightly, and the fire elements in the air became twice as volatile as usual. Nian Bing and Dao Lu walked out of the room together. They exchanged a smile, both knowing that they were about to face the eruption of the Phoenix Volcano during the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony. Nian Bing had never experienced a volcanic eruption before, but Dao Lu had experienced countless. In the environment of the Divine Continent, volcanoes erupted frequently. He was all too familiar with such natural disasters.\n\nYu Ru Yan, Feng Nü, Long Ling, and Lan Chen, along with Feng Xu, also walked out of their rooms. They gathered together. Feng Xu's expression appeared unusually solemn as he looked at the Phoenix Volcano, hundreds of feet away from the Phoenix village. He said in a deep voice, \"It's time. Let's go. The eruption of the Phoenix Volcano will bring out the Phoenix Flames and a massive amount of lava foam. What we need to do is suppress this lava foam from spreading and keep it within the volcano until the volcano calms down. Our clan's Nine Li Battle Qi cultivates the Phoenix Flames. Under normal circumstances, Phoenix clan members participating in the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony, as long as their strength is sufficient to suppress the volcanic eruption, will not only be unharmed but will also receive a certain boost in their cultivation due to the dense Phoenix Flames.\" He then glanced at Lan Chen as if subconsciously. \"However, the situation today is different. What kind of scene will emerge is entirely unknown, so please be careful. Follow me.\" With that, he spread his figure and moved lightning-fast towards the Phoenix Volcano. Feng Nü, Yu Ru Yan, and Lan Chen unfolded their royal feathers, Long Ling used Blizzard, and Nian Bing and Dao Lu leaped up simultaneously. The seven of them headed towards the Phoenix Volcano.\n\nThe Phoenix Volcano, on the surface, looked like an ordinary mountain, except that no life grew on it. As soon as they began the ascent, everyone clearly felt a scorching heat emanating from the mountain body, with heat surging to erupt. The surrounding air seemed to have become distorted, but this heat did not greatly affect them. Nian Bing gave the Sigh of the Ice Goddess to Long Ling and guarded Bing Yun himself. Relying on the cold qi from the Morning Dew Saber, Long Ling was minimally affected by the scorching aura. Nian Bing, using his Heavenly Eye domain, helped Bing Yun dispel the surrounding scorching aura. Twenty days ago, even the nine fire phoenixes transformed by the powerful Phoenix Chen Yi Grand Formation were weakened by half within Nian Bing's fully exerted Heavenly Eye domain, so this heat was not a threat at all.\n\nThey were all powerhouses among humans. A thousand-zhang peak might take ordinary people a whole day to climb, but for them, it was incredibly simple. In a quarter of an hour, they had ascended from the base to the summit. Within the embrace of the volcano, immense fire energy continuously flowed from the summit. When they reached the summit, Nian Bing immediately noticed that the summit of this massive volcano bore some resemblance to the Death Lake on Green Mountain, except there was no lake water here, but a reverse conical pit. The deepest part of the pit was about a hundred feet. Around this conical pit, there were five huge golden runes—patterns of five phoenixes, each in a different posture. Currently, the five runes were emitting a faint golden light, and from the deepest part of the conical pit, thick smoke was continuously rising.",

    "content": "The surrounding rocks grew scorching hot, the air distortions becoming more apparent, and waves of heat continuously emanated outwards from the volcano's center.\n\nFeng Xu said, \"Those five golden phoenixes are seals left by our ancestors. When we inject the Nine Li Battle Qi into them, we can activate their sealing power to restrain this volcano. Yan'er, when the ceremony begins, we will each control two seals, and the Phoenix Girl will control one. Nian Bing, you act according to circumstances, just remember to contain the erupting magma within the volcano. The volcano erupts most fiercely in its initial stages; as long as we can endure this period, it will become easier to handle. However, today's changes might be different.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"I understand, Elder. Rest assured, we will do our best. Brother Xi Lu, you protect Ling'er, and I will protect Chen Chen.\"\n\nYu Ru Yan said, \"Elder Feng Xu, you only need to control one seal. Let me and the Phoenix Girl each control two seals.\" The five seals were originally meant to be controlled by five elders.\n\nFeng Xu was startled and said, \"How can that be? In the past few years, my Phoenix Nine Transformations has finally broken through again, reaching the fourth transformation of Phoenix Shadow Split. Although controlling two seals is slightly strenuous, it should still be manageable.\"\n\nThe Phoenix Girl said, \"Elder, as Mother said, let me control two seals. Don't worry, I am confident I can complete it. I have already reached the sixth transformation of Phoenix Nine Transformations, the Phoenix.\"\n\n\"What?\" Feng Xu was stunned. He could hardly believe his ears. When the Phoenix Girl left the Phoenix clan, the clan had not yet discovered the special cultivation methods for the first two transformations of Phoenix Nine Transformations. At that time, the Phoenix Girl could barely even manifest the second transformation, Royal Feather. Yet, now she was telling him she could use the abilities of the sixth transformation. How was this possible? In the history of the Phoenix clan, no one had ever progressed so quickly. He didn't know, of course. Under the effect of the Tears of the Angel, which Nian Bing had unleashed at the cost of his life, the Phoenix Girl had undergone a transformative change. Coupled with the opening of the Celestial Eye acupoint, her cultivation speed had entered an entirely different realm. In a year and a half, her strength had made a qualitative leap. Even Yu Ru Yan was no match for the Phoenix Girl, who now possessed an opened Celestial Eye acupoint. Among the three members of the Phoenix clan present, the Phoenix Girl was the strongest. And among all seven people present, Feng Xu was the weakest in terms of strength. Even Long Ling had reached the level of an Ice Element Archmage, and with the advantage of her Celestial Eye acupoint, her strength was no less than Feng Xu's.\n\nFeng Xu cast a doubtful glance at the Phoenix Girl and said, \"Alright then, let's begin now.\" He also wanted to see if the Phoenix Girl's sixth transformation was real or not. If the Phoenix Girl had truly reached the sixth transformation, then even though only three of them were present today, the intensity of the Nine Li Battle Qi unleashed would likely be no less than that of five elders who had reached the third transformation.\n\nFeng Xu's expression became extremely serious. Feeling the heat and increasingly intense vibrations emanating from the Phoenix Volcano, he bit the middle finger of his right hand. Wrapped in golden Nine Li Battle Qi, he floated out and shot towards a golden phoenix symbol closest to the mountain wall like lightning. As he made his move, Yu Ru Yan and the Phoenix Girl simultaneously bit the middle fingers of their hands and flicked out two drops of blood each towards the other four phoenix patterns. They were both once the phoenixes of hope for the Phoenix clan, and naturally knew what to do at the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony. The five drops of blood landed on the five phoenix patterns almost simultaneously.\n\nA strange scene occurred. Stimulated by the blood of the Phoenix royal lineage, the five golden phoenix patterns seemed to come alive. With flashes of golden light, the five phoenixes transformed into countless streaks of golden light and soared into the sky. The scorching air currents in the sky were instantly absorbed by more than half by these five golden phoenixes, and the air immediately became cooler. However, just as everyone felt the ancient sealing power of the Phoenix clan begin to take effect, the Phoenix Volcano beneath their feet violently shook, and surging fire energy erupted with immense power. With a loud boom, accompanied by countless stones and dust, a fiery red light shot up from the center of the Phoenix Volcano, reaching a height of a hundred zhang in the sky in the blink of an eye. The surrounding air became completely distorted, and the scorching airflow rose to its extreme. Even Long Ling, protected by the Morning Dew Blade, paled slightly and only stabilized her body with the protection of Xi Lu's black Battle Qi. Nian Bing opened his Celestial Eye domain, enveloping himself and Lan Chen, and the domain's ability played a significant role in weakening the expansion of fire elements.\n\nThe five golden phoenixes that had just risen into the sky were immediately scattered to the sides by the sudden eruption of the volcano. At this moment, the five golden phoenixes also began to play their intended roles. Golden flames shot out in all directions, condensing into a huge light shield that completely encased the erupting lava, including the stones and dust, preventing them from spreading outwards.\n\n\"Royal Feather!\" Feng Xu shouted, and fiery red wings floated out from behind him, carrying his body into the air. Two streams of surging golden flames were injected into the central golden pillar of light, merging with the golden phoenixes he had activated earlier with his royal bloodline. At the same time, the Phoenix Girl and Yu Ru Yan took the same action, except that the phoenix flames they released from each hand merged into one golden phoenix each. The five golden phoenixes, which had been swaying precariously from the impact of the volcanic eruption, regained their brilliance under the joint efforts of the three. They forcibly suppressed the erupting volcanic ash from spreading outwards. The volcano's tremors intensified, each eruption stronger than the last. The bodies of the three floating in mid-air also advanced from the second transformation, Royal Feather, to the third transformation, Phoenix Phantom Body.\n\nThree ethereal golden-red figures flapped their wings behind them, controlling their bodies. Their constantly shifting forms indicated the immense pressure they were enduring.\n\nThe Phoenix Girl exchanged a glance with her mother. Their thoughts were in sync. Three Phoenix clan members who had reached the Phoenix Phantom Body were not enough to control the five golden phoenix seals with optimal effect. Therefore, they unhesitatingly chose to transform further. Six ethereal figures appeared out of thin air. As they transformed, the phoenix flames injected into the golden phoenixes multiplied exponentially. The surging golden light completely suppressed the volcanic eruption. The five golden phoenixes, lifelike, circled in the air, preventing the scorching airflow from being released. The Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony truly began at this moment.\n\nWith two at the fourth transformation and one at the third, fully unleashing the potential of the phoenix seals, Feng Xu felt the pressure greatly reduced. The three people maintained the energy increase for the seals, all secretly breathing a sigh of relief.\n\nNian Bing and the other three stood at the edge of the volcano, watching. After the seals had fully activated, the scorching heat in the surrounding air had noticeably decreased. Although the power of the volcanic eruption continued to increase, it was clearly not easy to break through this seal. Nian Bing concentrated his mental power, ready to act at any moment. On the other side, Long Ling had already begun chanting incantations, and Xi Lu had also taken out his Godslayer Battle Axe.\n\nIf it were the previous Phoenix Submersion Grand Ceremony, the three of Feng Girl would only need to sustain their efforts until the volcanic eruption subsided from its peak, and the ceremony would be successfully completed. However, this eruption was indeed different from the past. The records of the Phoenix clan were not wrong. Just as they were gaining control of the situation, Lan Chen, standing beside Nian Bing, began to change.\n\nLan Chen clearly felt her body becoming unusually hot. This heat was not due to external heat but emanated from within. Her ice magic power had not decreased; on the contrary, it was strengthening. However, the sensation of heat grew more and more intense, as if it were burning her body completely. She gritted her teeth, enduring the upward-driving pain, but the heat within her body had already begun to spread outwards. Nian Bing, who had been holding Lan Chen's hand, immediately noticed the change in her body. Lan Chen's small hands were always cold, but he was surprised to find that her normally cold hands were now scorching hot. Startled, he turned to look at Lan Chen and was about to ask when he saw Lan Chen's face contorted in pain. Immediately after, blue wings unfurled from Lan Chen's back. She let out a cry of pain and her body involuntarily shot up into the sky.\n\nNian Bing was startled and quickly cast a wind-elemental flight spell on himself to chase after Lan Chen. But at this moment, Lan Chen's body underwent three consecutive transformations. The three transformations were completed almost instantly, each transformation strengthening her phoenix transformation by one level, advancing directly from Royal Feather to Phoenix Wingbeat Five-Colored Movement. The three blue figures simultaneously turned five-colored. Lan Chen let out another cry of pain, and the three bodies flew off in three different directions. The wildly surging five-colored light moved rapidly, and with each surge, it brought with it a powerful aura.\n\nFeng Xu, flying in the air, was still fully controlling the golden phoenix seals and could not spare himself to stop Lan Chen. But when he saw Lan Chen go through the transformations of Phoenix Shadow Split and Phoenix Wingbeat Five-Colored Movement successively, a strong sense of unease surged in his heart. He roared, \"Quick, stop all her actions!\"\n\nWithout Feng Xu's command, Nian Bing had already reacted quickly. He lunged towards the central Lan Chen himself, and at the same time, his body split into four Shadow Puppets. The Wind Shadow Puppet and Dark Shadow Puppet moved towards the leftmost Lan Chen, while the Space Shadow Puppet and Light Shadow Puppet pursued the rightmost Lan Chen. In this critical moment, Nian Bing's Celestial Eye domain was fully activated, and his speed, along with that of his four Shadow Puppets, reached its limit.\n\nHowever, Lan Chen, who had entered the fifth transformation of the Phoenix, also reached her speed limit. After splitting into three figures, she instantly darted towards the central golden phoenix seal. Her body seemed to be struggling, but it appeared as though this forward dash was beyond her control. From the edge of the volcano to the center was only a short distance. Just as she was about to rush into the golden seal, Nian Bing and the four Shadow Puppets finally arrived in time, blocking Lan Chen's path. Seeing Lan Chen's current state, Nian Bing couldn't help but be startled. Lan Chen's eyes had turned completely ice-blue, filled with pain, and five-colored light surged all over her body. Seeing Nian Bing's obstruction, she actually raised her hands and unleashed a surge of five-colored light towards Nian Bing and the four Shadow Puppets.\n\nNian Bing knew that of the three Lan Chens, only one was real. However, under the effect of Phoenix Shadow Split, he could not distinguish which one was real and which was fake. His rich combat experience greatly helped him. Without hesitation, he and the four Shadow Puppets immediately lunged forward. The first to take effect were the Space Shadow Puppet and the Light Shadow Puppet. Under Nian Bing's immense mental power, he divided his consciousness into five streams, controlling his own body and the four Shadow Puppets separately. Pure light elements surged out, enveloping Lan Chen's body. It was clearly a high-level healing spell that neutralized the five-colored light Lan Chen unleashed. Just as Lan Chen's charging momentum slightly slowed down, the Space Shadow Puppet emitted a silver light and, with a spatial teleportation, sent Lan Chen to the edge of the volcano. At this time, the full power of Lan Chen's attack was displayed, but she was already far from the volcanic eruption's central light column.\n\nMeanwhile, Nian Bing himself and the Earth and Wind Shadow Puppets were not idle. Nian Bing's approach was simple. Disregarding the high temperature of the five-colored flames, he rushed forward and embraced the Lan Chen in front of him. Of course, this was not a rash action. Although the Celestial Eye domain had no offensive capabilities, its defense, amplification, and weakening effects were extremely powerful. Especially after Nian Bing's Celestial Eye acupoint reached its ultimate state, his Celestial Eye domain had reached a new height. Twenty days ago, it was also with the cooperation of the Celestial Eye domain that he was able to significantly weaken the attack power of the Phoenix Wing Array and then, through amplification, complete the thirteenth-order Seven Forbidden Seven Absolute Curse. Under the effect of the Celestial Eye domain, as Nian Bing embraced Lan Chen's body, her attack landed on Nian Bing's chest. Nian Bing grunted, and the seven-colored light of the Celestial Eye domain surged simultaneously. While being attacked, he minimized the fire elements attached to the attack. Lan Chen was not a warrior but a mage, so the attack launched by her palms would naturally not cause Nian Bing any harm. Holding her body, Nian Bing suddenly accelerated and followed the Space Shadow Puppet and Light Shadow Puppet back to the edge of the volcano.\n\nThe Earth Shadow Puppet and Dark Shadow Puppet adopted the same direct approach. Black Emperor, as the strongest of the Shadow Puppets, had long been in sync with Nian Bing's intentions. Although Lan Chen had already used the fifth transformation of the Phoenix Nine Transformations, how could she be a match for Black Emperor?\n\nThe Demon Devouring Blade drew an arc in the air, instantly creating a black void that completely swallowed the surging five-colored flames. The next moment, the Wind Shadow Puppet, carrying a green tornado, swept up Lan Chen's body and sent her flying towards Nian Bing.",

    "content": "Though all of this happened in a mere instant, Nian Bing had already exerted his full strength. All his Shadow Puppets unleashed their strongest abilities, managing to halt Lan Chen, who had reached her fifth transformation. At this moment, he had but one thought: to obey Feng Xu’s words and prevent Lan Chen, now split into three figures, from approaching the central seal before the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony was completed.\n\nBut would it truly go smoothly? The three Lan Chens, brought back to the volcano’s edge by the combined efforts of Nian Bing and his Shadow Puppets, all paused for a moment. However, their ethereal forms suddenly grew stronger. Only their three pairs of blue eyes remained so real. A clear phoenix cry simultaneously erupted from all three figures, and light burst forth. Nian Bing felt the figure in his arms vanish as Lan Chen transformed into blue light and ascended into the sky. He watched as the three figures merged into one.\n\nA five-colored light instantly flared, coalescing into a giant phoenix soaring in mid-air. The phoenix’s eyes were ice-blue. Its massive wings spanned ten feet, and its five-colored body rapidly expanded upon the air cushion. The light radiating from its five-colored flames was no weaker than the seal formed by the five golden phoenixes.\n\nFeng Nu and Yu Ruyan watched in astonishment as Lan Chen broke through her bottleneck to reach the sixth transformation. They were greatly alarmed. While an increase in power was usually a good thing, in this situation, it indicated a significant problem with Lan Chen herself. Her increased strength would only complicate matters. Without hesitation, Feng Nu and Yu Ruyan both moved. Yu Ruyan’s three separated figures simultaneously glowed with five-colored light, instantly ascending to the fifth transformation of the Phoenix Nine Transformations. Feng Nu’s three figures fused together even faster, skipping the fifth transformation entirely. Utilizing her control over her own energy through the Heavenly Eye acupoint, another giant phoenix appeared in the air. However, the phoenix formed by Feng Nu had entirely red eyes, as clear as rubies.\n\nFollowing Feng Nu’s transformation, Yu Ruyan’s three figures, after their five-colored fifth transformation, also fused. They moved from the fifth to the sixth transformation, and another giant phoenix appeared in the sky. The phoenix formed by Yu Ruyan had emerald green eyes. Three giant phoenixes floated in the air. Having entered the sixth transformation, Feng Nu and Yu Ruyan’s powers surged instantly. Yu Ruyan alone was easily cooperating with Elder Feng Xu to control the seal resisting the volcanic eruption. Feng Nu circled in the air and met Lan Chen from below.\n\nNian Bing also ascended into the air at that moment. The Shadow Puppets were fully withdrawn, and gray light condensed beneath him. Oscar’s massive form appeared out of thin air. His dragon wings spread wide, carrying Nian Bing a step ahead of Feng Nu to intercept Lan Chen. Although also transformed into a sixth-transformation phoenix, Lan Chen’s five-colored phoenix was twice the size of Feng Nu’s and Yu Ruyan’s. Her immense body was even larger than Oscar’s. She floated in mid-air, and contrary to everyone’s worries, she did not charge directly towards the light pillar of the volcanic eruption. Instead, she simply floated there, her five-colored aura rippling in waves. Her blue eyes flickered with a struggle, but Lan Chen was still unable to control her body. Feng Nu flew to Nian Bing’s side, and they also remained still. With each passing moment, the completion of the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony gained an extra minute of certainty. At this point, the volcanic eruption had begun to weaken from its initial intensity.\n\nJust then, a blue light shield enveloped Lan Chen’s body from behind. The aura was clearly that of ice. Although the light shield was not strong, it caused the flames around Lan Chen’s body to contract. It was a magic from Dragon Spirit. Fearing she might harm Lan Chen, Dragon Spirit used the Sigh of the Ice Snow Goddess as her magic staff to cast this spell, employing an ice-type sealing technique.\n\nBut just as Dragon Spirit’s magic began to take effect, a strange scene unfolded. The flames clearly burning around Lan Chen’s body instantly devoured the ice-type sealing spell. Immense, scorching energy continued to surge. However, the heat was not like ordinary flames; it seemed to be a cold heat. The two opposing sensations made both Feng Nu and Nian Bing feel that something was amiss. At that moment, the five-colored flames around Lan Chen’s body began to change. The five-colored light, as it rippled, began to shift towards a pure color. The ground beneath Lan Chen suddenly split open without warning, and a surge of magma shot upwards, integrating into Lan Chen’s body from below. Immediately, the five-colored flames around Lan Chen’s body transformed, turning blue like her eyes. The magma was absorbed completely by her body without any leakage. Blue flames gently wafted, and the blue phoenix appeared so captivating.\n\nFeng Nu gasped in surprise, “Phoenix Nine Transformations, seventh transformation, Phoenix True Body. Ah! No, this is Yin Fire.”\n\nBefore Feng Nu and Nian Bing could reach her, Lan Chen spat out a stream of blue flame. The flame was not directed at Nian Bing and Feng Nu but at the ground. Nian Bing quickly understood the meaning of this Yin Fire. On the surface, there was no scorching aura, no grand display, and no booming sound from the flame’s explosion. However, the rocks on the ground instantly disintegrated. As soon as the vaporized rock disappeared, another surge of magma erupted. Perhaps triggered by the Yin Fire, the entire Phoenix Volcano began to shake violently. The energy at the volcanic eruption site, which had been completely resisted by Yu Ruyan and Feng Xu, instantly increased tenfold. The crater abruptly expanded outwards, and fiery red magma continuously spread. Under the intense impact, the five golden phoenixes disappeared with golden light. The five-colored phoenix formed by Yu Ruyan flashed in the air, catching Feng Xu from mid-air, and instantly retreated from the crater’s vicinity. By this point, the volcanic eruption was beyond their control.\n\nFollowing this, magma erupted in successive waves from the conical crater. The gaps gradually connected. In just a few breaths, the entire volcano had fully erupted. A massive pillar of fire, hundreds of times larger than before, spewed scorching flames into the sky, turning the entire sky a fiery red due to the intense heat.\n\nXie Lu, without delay, had already flown down the mountain with Dragon Spirit. In such intense heat, apart from fire elements, no other magical elements existed in the air. Therefore, Dragon Spirit could not fly and could only retreat instantly under Xie Lu’s guidance. The lava erupted from the volcano was fiery red with flecks of golden light. The immense and scorching energy was unbearable even for Nian Bing and Oscar. Although the Heavenly Eye domain was powerful, facing such a fierce roar of nature, they could only retreat. Oscar spread his wings wide, carrying Nian Bing, and instantly escaped the volcanic eruption zone.\n\nFeng Nu and Yu Ruyan followed suit and retreated. However, when everyone had left the crater, they were horrified to discover that Lan Chen’s body had been swallowed by the erupting lava.\n\nYu Ruyan and Nian Bing let out cries of grief almost simultaneously. Nian Bing leaped from his body, intending to rush towards the volcano, only to find that there were no wind or ice elements left in the air for him to fly. Oscar caught his body again and, no matter how Nian Bing pleaded, refused to carry him towards the violently erupting lava. He wasn’t doing it for himself but to protect Nian Bing. Nian Bing’s mind was filled with Oscar’s reassurances, but at this moment, how could he listen? Lan Chen had been completely swallowed by the volcanic eruption’s magma, which felt like it had swallowed his heart, plunging him into an abyss of pain. He shouted madly, wanting to summon his Shadow Puppets to carry him into the scorching magma. But at this moment, all the Shadow Puppets refused his request. As the sword souls of divine artifacts, they had their own consciousness and could not watch their master go to his death in vain.\n\nNian Bing’s heart shattered. His heart was broken in the surge of emotions, but while he could not act, it did not mean Feng Nu and Yu Ruyan could not. A strange scene occurred: the phoenixes formed by Feng Nu and Yu Ruyan both changed from five-colored to pure red. If it were any other time, they might have excitedly discovered they had entered the seventh transformation of the Phoenix Nine Transformations, the Phoenix True Body. But now, they had no mind to care about their own strength. Although the Phoenix Tribe was fire-elemental, even their bodies could not withstand the lava’s high temperature of thousands of degrees! Yu Ruyan rushed forward first, heading straight for the lava, but Feng Nu was faster. She reached the vicinity of the crater before Yu Ruyan. She sharply turned back, and a scorching red airflow burst forth, forcefully stopping Yu Ruyan’s charge. “Mom, let me go.” Before Yu Ruyan could react, the fire-red phoenix formed by Feng Nu plunged headfirst into the wildly surging volcanic eruption.\n\nYu Ruyan’s body was forcefully thrown back. When she tried to charge forward again, a gray barrier blocked her. Oscar, carrying Nian Bing, flew at the fastest speed, but could only stop Yu Ruyan. Feng Nu, meanwhile, had already disappeared. Tears streamed down Nian Bing’s face, “Mom, don’t.” His heart felt as if it shattered in an instant. Both his wives had charged into the sea of fire that resembled hell. In truth, how could he not want to charge in himself? But at this critical moment, he had to stop the impulsive Yu Ruyan first. Nian Bing deeply regretted it, regretting why he had agreed to return with Feng Nu, why he had brought Lan Chen back to the Phoenix Tribe. If they hadn’t come to the Phoenix Tribe, how could they have faced this sudden change? Nian Bing realized at this moment how powerless he was in the face of nature’s roar. The complete volcanic eruption in front of him caused all magical elements other than fire elements in the vicinity to disappear, forming a magical vacuum. No matter how strong his mental power was, without magical elements to command, how could he possibly rush in? The flames, carrying golden light spots, were filled with abnormally scorching air currents. Was this what was called the Phoenix True Fire? Nian Bing also knew that Oscar and the Shadow Puppets were right. Although he possessed fire magic and a resilient body, once he rushed into this surging magma, he would be utterly unable to escape. Therefore, earlier he had wanted to break away from Oscar and charge into the crater alone.\n\nAt this moment, Feng Xu was quietly watching the surging volcanic explosion a hundred feet away. Strange light flickered in his eyes, and he muttered, “Strange, very strange!” Five-colored light emanated from his body. His ethereal form changed from one to three. Just moments ago, during the brief instant of the complete volcanic eruption, he clearly felt the Jiu Li Dou Qi within him ignite as if it had been lit, instantly reaching a level he had never achieved before, directly crossing two stages from the third transformation to the fifth transformation. This was something he had never even dared to imagine.\n\nYu Ruyan said sharply, “Nian Bing, get out of the way. I’m going in to save my daughter. Don’t worry about me. If anything happens to them, what’s the point of me living?”\n\nNian Bing looked at Yu Ruyan dazedly. Suddenly, his eyes became firm, and he nodded. “Alright, Mother. Then you take me inside.” Even though he knew it was suicide, when both his wives were in such grave danger, he would never back down. Oscar refused to go with him. His energy body could actually sustain itself externally, but it couldn’t form a physical body, much like the undead. However, his soul had already merged with this energy-formed body. As long as he could continue to cultivate, and when the Dragon God Heart Method reached a certain level, he might be able to reconstitute a physical form. It was just that his self-cultivation would be slower than cultivating within Nian Bing’s body. At this point, he could no longer afford to be cautious. If they could not live together, he hoped they could die together. This was Nian Bing’s only thought. With that, he had no further hesitation.\n\nUpon hearing Nian Bing’s words, Yu Ruyan was also stunned. Just as she was wondering what to do, Feng Xu’s voice suddenly rang out, “Wait a moment, don’t be rash.” The three Feng Xus simultaneously flew in front of Nian Bing and Yu Ruyan. The three figures merged into one, becoming the Phoenix Tribe’s chief elder, radiating five-colored light. Feng Xu said, “Don’t be rash. Listen to me first. Feng Nu and Lan Chen might not be in trouble. Perhaps, being in the magma isn’t a bad thing for them, but rather a good thing.”\n\nYu Ruyan anxiously asked, “Elder, speak quickly. Is there any record in our Phoenix Tribe’s ancient texts?”\n\nFeng Xu shook his head and said, “No, the tribal texts do not record the current situation. However, haven’t you noticed something? This is the first time there has been such an intense volcanic eruption. But we are very close to the crater, yet the temperature hasn’t increased much compared to before. Moreover, haven’t you noticed that the erupted magma hasn’t spilled out of the volcano, nor has any magma fallen from the sky?”",

    "content": "Upon hearing Feng Xu's words, Nian Bing and Yu Ru Yan noticed that the lava erupting from the volcano, accompanied by a faint golden glow, shot straight into the sky. However, this pillar of lava seemed to be constrained, just like during the previous volcanic eruptions within the five Golden Phoenix seals. Although it was erupting wildly, no lava leaked outwards. As Elder Feng Xu said, their location only had rich fire elements, but the temperature hadn't risen much. The surrounding air was slightly distorted, but the temperature was still bearable.\n\nThis discovery immediately reignited a sliver of hope in Nian Bing and Yu Ru Yan's hearts. Nian Bing said, \"Elder Feng Xu, what should we do now? Should we just wait like this?\"\n\nFeng Xu nodded and said, \"Yes, we wait. 'Ice Phoenix appears, Phoenix ascends.' This prophecy is of utmost importance in our Phoenix clan's ancient texts, and everything happening before us indicates that this is no ordinary volcanic eruption. There must be a secret within it, so we must wait. I believe that when the volcanic eruption ends, the truth will be revealed to us. We are descendants of the Phoenix, and our ancestors would not abandon us. Nian Bing, do you remember what you said to me when you first came to the Phoenix clan? Looking back now, what you said makes a lot of sense. The appearance of the Ice Phoenix and the ascension of the Phoenix may not be a bad thing; it could even be an opportunity for our Phoenix clan. Now, Feng Nu and Lan Chen are in the midst of this intense eruption of the Phoenix Volcano. If the epoch was indeed triggered by the Ice Phoenix, then perhaps they have already obtained the true power of their ancestor, the Phoenix. Therefore, we must wait; it is the only way.\"\n\nYu Ru Yan pondered, \"I'll charge in to take a look. Perhaps my presence can help them.\"\n\nFeng Xu quickly said, \"No, you cannot go in. What I've said is merely conjecture, and the lava temperature is extremely high. If anything goes wrong once you enter, it will be troublesome. Yan'er, don't forget that Feng Nu and Lan Chen are both your daughters. They are connected by blood; one is the Ice Phoenix, and the other is the Fire Phoenix. With their strength at the seventh transformation, if they cannot survive until the end, your going in would be a futile sacrifice. If they are obtaining an opportunity, then your interference could greatly affect them. Therefore, we can only wait now.\"\n\nLong Ling and Xi Lu stood at the foot of the mountain, watching the people in the sky. Long Ling was the weakest at this moment. She had lost her ice magic, and besides her Heavenly Eye acupoint, which allowed her to observe, she was no different from an ordinary person. Thus, she could only wait anxiously. Xi Lu wanted to go up to help Nian Bing and the others, but Long Ling had lost her magic. If the lava eruption changed unexpectedly, she wouldn't even be able to run. Since Nian Bing had entrusted his wife to his protection, how could he leave his post? If something happened to Long Ling, wouldn't it be even more troublesome? Therefore, Xi Lu stayed by Long Ling's side, observing the situation above with her. Due to the speed of the previous events and the brilliance of the various lights, they hadn't noticed that Feng Nu and Lan Chen had already been swallowed by the overwhelming lava.\n\nTime ticked by, but the volcanic eruption became increasingly fierce, and the surrounding temperature finally began to rise. The golden light within the lava also began to strengthen. Nian Bing cast a fire magic, tentatively trying to extract some lava to feel its current state. However, he was horrified to discover that his ninth-tier fire magic, \"Right Hand of the Fire God,\" although elevated from ninth to tenth tier due to the surrounding fire elements, melted the moment it touched the golden-red lava.\n\nIf someone had told Nian Bing before that fire magic could also melt, he would have scoffed, but now the fact was right before his eyes. The Purple True Fire had the highest temperature among fire magic, but it was nowhere comparable to the golden flame before him. Could this be the Phoenix True Fire? What kind of creature was the Phoenix? According to what the Dragon Kings had told him back then, when the Phoenix was alive, its power should have been comparable to that of the Dragon God, meaning it was a being close to the fourteenth tier. Although there was only one Phoenix, its strength should have been equivalent to that of the dragons, becoming the strongest creature in the world. Could fourteenth-tier flames possess such intensity? If so, how terrifying would the power of the Four True Gods, like Ka'ao, who reached sixteenth tier, be!\n\nNian Bing's confidence had greatly increased after killing two divine beings recently and further improving his strength by opening the Xi Jing acupoint. However, facing the Phoenix True Fire at this moment, he once again felt that the gap between himself and the strongest was like an insurmountable chasm. How much cultivation would his magic require to reach the strength of the fourteenth tier? Ka'ao had once told him that if he could fully open seven acupoints, possess three Imperial acupoints, and master the two energies of life and death within his body, harmonizing them for his use, then he might also reach the strength of the True God's sixteenth tier. Opening seven acupoints, Nian Bing felt, was not extremely difficult, especially since he had already opened his Heavenly Eye acupoint and the most difficult Imperial acupoint. The Li Zhong and Xi Jing acupoints had also reached the mid-stage. With the Xi Jing acupoint, opening the Fang Jia acupoint was imminent. The Di Ling and Ting Yun acupoints, which had relatively lesser effects among the seven major acupoints, should also not be too difficult. However, the biggest problem now was the Imperial and Heavenly Eye fusion acupoint between his eyebrows. If he couldn't liberate the Heavenly Eye acupoint and fully release his spiritual power, it was unlikely he could control the two energies of life and death within his body his entire life, and it would also be difficult to open another Imperial acupoint. But even Ka'ao had no solution for his current situation, so what else could he do?\n\nCultivation, only through continuous cultivation and experience could he gain more understanding. Nian Bing, realizing his lack of strength, suddenly had the idea of going into seclusion for arduous practice. However, his mood was currently very low. While cultivation was important, the lives of Feng Nu and Lan Chen were even more important. Only when they were out of danger could Nian Bing settle down and develop.\n\nThe wait was painful and long. Not to mention Nian Bing and Yu Ru Yan, even Feng Xu was gradually becoming anxious. The volcanic eruption before him was indeed strange, but he couldn't be certain of the mysteries produced by this eruption. He carefully pondered all the records in the Phoenix clan's ancient texts, but those records did not provide any methods to deal with the current situation. Wait, there was nothing else to do but wait.\n\nTime passed by second by second. Nian Bing, Yu Ru Yan, and Feng Xu had all retreated another hundred paces. The temperature near the volcano was simply too high, seemingly from the continuous heat released by the Phoenix True Fire.\n\nAn hour later, the lava erupting from the volcano gradually stopped increasing in intensity. However, its color changed, from the original golden-red to alternating flashes of red and blue light. The temperature also completely exploded from that moment on, forcing Nian Bing and the other two to retreat. Both Feng Xu and Yu Ru Yan felt that within this scorching aura, their Nine Li Battle Qi became more solidified. But their primary concern was still the safety of Lan Chen and Feng Nu. In Feng Xu's heart, the safety of Lan Chen and Feng Nu also related to the future of the Phoenix clan! If the prophecy \"Ice Phoenix appears, Phoenix ascends\" could truly bring about an opportunity for the Phoenix clan, then it would greatly contribute to the clan's development. The biggest problem facing the Phoenix clan now was the decreasing number of people with royal bloodlines. Once the royal bloodline disappeared in the near future, it would be equivalent to the disappearance of the Phoenix clan. After all, the Nine Transformations of the Phoenix was the true ability possessed by the Phoenix clan!\n\nThe golden flame eruption of the Phoenix Volcano had now reached a saturated state. Each flash of light caused a fluctuation of heat outwards, and the heatwaves swept through the air, leaving no trace of clouds within a radius of dozens of miles. The clear blue sky was rendered by the golden flames, a brilliant blue-gold that seemed to herald something.\n\nNian Bing had more than once wanted to use his magic power to condense magic elements from afar to counteract the volcanic eruption. However, after several attempts, he didn't even have a sliver of success. Just as he had judged, the intensity of the Phoenix Volcano when fully erupting the Phoenix True Fire had reached the fourteenth tier. Even if he and Xi Lu joined forces and unleashed their strongest attacks, they couldn't stop this flame from erupting, let alone stop it. What made them hesitant was that once the attack's power was too great and damaged the structure of the Phoenix Volcano itself, it might expand the eruption area, which would then be truly irrecoverable. Therefore, no matter how unwilling Nian Bing was, he had to continue waiting.\n\nAn hour passed, then another hour. From early morning until evening, the golden flame showed no signs of disappearing. Even when he had used the Seven Forbidden, Seven Ultimate Spell, Nian Bing hadn't felt as exhausted as he did now. The fatigue was not from his body but entirely from his spirit. Worry, regret, and various other emotions continuously stimulated him. He could only force himself to remain calm and suppress the urge to rush into the Phoenix Volcano.\n\nAs night fell, the golden flame became even more prominent in the sky. Just as Nian Bing, Yu Ru Yan, and Feng Xu were reaching the limits of their physical and mental endurance from waiting, the golden flame of the Phoenix Volcano eruption finally showed a change.\n\nThe surging golden flame suddenly paused for a moment. Following that, the golden light, which was indistinguishable from lava or a fiery eye, quickly condensed in the air. A massive golden phoenix, occupying the entire mountaintop of the volcano, appeared. With each flap of its vast, hundreds of zhang wide fiery wings, its body rose a little higher.\n\nThe Phoenix flapped its wings and cried out, its clear phoenix cry causing Nian Bing and the others' hearts to leap into their throats. At this moment, the golden phoenix actually soared into the sky, transforming into a massive beam of golden light and flying upwards. The golden light grew smaller and smaller in the sky, whether due to the increasing distance or the continuous consumption of energy.\n\nNian Bing was extremely anxious. With Oscar's help, he immediately chased after the Golden Phoenix. However, the speed at which the Golden Phoenix ascended was truly terrifying. Even with his full speed, he could only watch as the massive phoenix disappeared.\n\nFeng Xu watched this strange spectacle thoughtfully and murmured to himself, \"Ice Phoenix appears, Phoenix ascends. The Phoenix has ascended, but what has this brought to our Phoenix clan?\" At this moment, his mood had relaxed somewhat. After all, the six ancient words had not brought destruction to the Phoenix clan.\n\nJust as Nian Bing gave up chasing the massive golden phoenix in the sky and prepared to return to the volcano to investigate, the phoenix cry suddenly became clear again. When he looked up, he saw the golden phoenix returning, flying back at twice the speed it had ascended. Suddenly feeling a surge of intense heat, before Nian Bing could give an order, Oscar had used his fastest possible speed to escape the path of the Golden Phoenix's return.\n\n\"Chih—\" A sound like water meeting fire erupted as the Golden Phoenix plunged into the volcano. In an instant, the golden light completely vanished, replaced by two beams of light, one blue and one red, rising. However, these two beams of light did not ascend further but condensed into two massive phoenixes, one blue and one red, each occupying half of the volcano's summit.\n\nSeeing this, Nian Bing's heart trembled. The aura of ice and fire made him clearly feel that his beloved wife still existed. The spiritual resonance generated by his Heavenly Eye acupoint had told him everything. Nian Bing had never felt so excited, so happy. All the waiting was finally over. With tears streaming down his face, he looked at the two massive phoenixes at the volcano's summit, shining with dazzling light.\n\nSmiling slightly, a powerful divine light flickered in Nian Bing's eyes. He brought his hands together in front of his chest. For the first time, he felt as if he had faith. He was thanking heaven for returning his beloved wife. At this moment, everything around him was so beautiful.\n\nThe light of the red and blue phoenixes gradually dimmed. The Phoenix Volcano, which had erupted for a full day, also gradually calmed down. If not for the surrounding volcanic rock still showing a dark red color due to the previous high temperature, it seemed as if the previous volcanic eruption had never happened. After all, this volcanic eruption had not caused any damage to the surroundings.\n\nWhen the red and blue lights finally dimmed, Nian Bing and Yu Ru Yan almost simultaneously plunged into the volcano. Elder Feng Xu, however, knelt at the edge of the volcano, slowly bowing towards the center of the crater. Tears welled up in his eyes, and he thanked heaven in his heart.",

    "content": "At the same time, he also prayed for the ancestors of the Phoenix tribe, the Ice Phoenix, who had sacrificed for the six words \"Ice Phoenix Appears, Phoenix Ascends.\" Excessive obsession and stupidity had caused the Phoenix tribe to miss opportunities to become strong several times. Now, without even needing to look into the crater, he could clearly feel that the Phoenix tribe's spring had arrived.\n\nTwo phoenixes stood quietly in the center of the crater. The blue one, with feathers like transparent sapphires, had deep, cold blue eyes. Its body, five zhang long, trembled slightly at the crown on its head, emitting a sacred aura. Its constantly flashing blue feathers were captivating.\n\nThe red phoenix possessed majestic red eyes. Its body was the same size as the blue phoenix, but its feathers were like carved rubies, shining with brilliant light. The icy aura of the blue phoenix and the scorching aura of the red phoenix were fundamentally different and should have been hostile energies. However, at this moment, these two energies intertwined intimately, with red and blue light alternating. The two phoenixes gazed at each other, spread their wings, and two clear, soaring phoenix cries rose to the sky, entwining as they ascended.\n\nYu Ruyan grabbed Nian Bing, who was about to rush forward, and choked out, \"Phoenix Eight Transformations, Phoenix Awakens, Body Becomes Phoenix.\"\n\nThe \"Phoenix Six Transformations, Body Like Phoenix\" referred to members of the Phoenix royal bloodline using pure energy to transform five-colored flames into the shape of a phoenix, thereby unleashing greater attack power. The \"Phoenix Seven Transformations, True Phoenix Body\" was when the five-colored flames turned pure, and the body expanded, truly activating the power of the phoenix. Therefore, the seventh transformation was a crucial bottleneck in the nine transformations. However, while both could transform into phoenix forms, they were still energy-based phoenixes. But the eighth transformation before them was a completely different concept, changing from \"body like phoenix\" to \"body becomes phoenix.\" What appeared before Yu Ruyan and Nian Bing were two fully materialized, real phoenixes, one blue and one red, no longer mere energy!\n\nThe red and blue lights gradually dimmed amidst the entanglement. The auras surrounding the two phoenixes also calmed. Their gazes simultaneously turned towards Nian Bing and Yu Ruyan. With a gentle beat of their massive wings, their five-zhang bodies stood upright. Immediately, their red and blue bodies glowed again, but this time the light was gradually shrinking. When the light reached human height, Nian Bing found two sacred, delicate bodies before him.\n\nIn the faint blue light, Lan Chen, completely naked, smiled at Nian Bing. There was no hint of shyness on her face, only deep emotion. Her fair skin, bathed in the blue glow, was like an ice goddess descended from heaven.\n\nIn the faint red light, Feng Nu, also completely naked, quietly gazed at Nian Bing. Her smile was equally captivating, and her skin, under the red glow, appeared so rosy and translucent. Her warm aura also warmed Nian Bing's heart.\n\n\"Chenchen, Feng Nu.\" Nian Bing could no longer resist the excitement of regaining them. He lunged forward, embracing Feng Nu and Lan Chen tightly. His heart trembled. Holding their breathtakingly beautiful bodies close, he didn't want to know what had happened. He just wanted to cherish and adore his wives, never letting them leave his side again. The near-perfect naked bodies did not stir any male desire in Nian Bing. At this moment, the overwhelming emotions in his heart had completely dispelled all other negative feelings. His heart held only his wives!\n\nAfter a long while, the three slowly separated. Nian Bing opened his spatial ring and took out two sets of coarse cloth robes to cover their alluring bodies. At this moment, Yu Ruyan stepped forward, and Xi Lu and Long Ling also came up from the foot of the mountain. It was their arrival that made Nian Bing reluctantly break away from the warmth.\n\n\"Mom—\" Feng Nu and Lan Chen simultaneously rushed into their mother's embrace. Not only was Nian Bing excited, but they were equally moved. The feeling of being reborn filled them with indescribable emotions. It was impossible not to feel a lingering fear.\n\nYu Ruyan hugged her two daughters, tears streaming down her face. Her worries were no less than Nian Bing's. Her daughters were her lifeblood. Seeing them safe and sound, Yu Ruyan felt incredibly happy.\n\nFeng Xu had also finished praying and stepped into the crater. Looking at Yu Ruyan, Feng Nu, and Lan Chen, he finally felt for the first time that it was time to change the Phoenix tribe's rules.\n\nThe emotional embrace moved from Yu Ruyan to Long Ling. The three women embraced and wept. Having lived together for so long, they had developed sisterly affection. It took a full half an hour for everyone's emotions to gradually calm down.\n\nBefore anyone could ask, Lan Chen and Feng Nu explained the events. After hearing their account, everyone truly understood the meaning of \"Ice Phoenix Appears, Phoenix Ascends.\"\n\nWhen Lan Chen lost control of herself, she discovered that her rich ice magic power had mutated; ice could burn, something she had never imagined before. But it was true, and it was precisely because of the mutation of her magic power that the subsequent changes occurred. When she completed the seventh transformation, to Feng Nu's gasp, Lan Chen realized that the blue flames burning within her were actually Yin Fire. Yin Fire was not a dark fire but also a pure fire. Just as she was wondering why this was happening, the Phoenix Volcano erupted.\n\nThe massive True Phoenix Fire made Lan Chen believe her life had reached its end. But to her surprise, she felt no heat from her surroundings. Instead, she entered a vast golden space. Shortly after entering this space, Feng Nu also rushed in. Since childhood, she had cultivated Phoenix Flame, and her Nine Li Dou Qi was extremely pure. But when she also entered this space, these sisters felt a strange aura, as if they were one. Whatever one felt, the other could clearly perceive, even their expressions and body movements became identical.\n\nA golden phoenix appeared in the golden space. The Golden Phoenix was in an energy form. In that instant, a memory appeared in both Feng Nu and Lan Chen's minds – a memory from ancient times.\n\nIt turned out that during the Great War of the Gods, the Phoenix, like some of the Dragon tribe, was part of the Lost Continent, and the Phoenix was the totem of the entire Lost Continent, revered by all humans on the Lost Continent. When the final war broke out, the sole Phoenix became the only powerful being on the Lost Continent capable of contending with the main god. Under its leadership, the combined forces of humans, elves, and dwarves launched a fierce attack. In this war, the Phoenix exerted its full power. It was through its all-out effort that it bought the Lost Continent time to achieve victory. The Phoenix's greatest advantage was not its strength but its near-invincibility. Each time it died defending against a main god, it would be reborn from the ashes, using its power to block the assistance of three main gods to the divine beings on the Divine Continent. Its consumption was undoubtedly immense. However, even the most powerful immortality was composed of energy. After the Phoenix's repeated and significant expenditures, it could no longer fully resurrect. By then, one of the main gods it fought against had already been killed by it. The Phoenix knew it could not continue fighting, so it chose to leave. Death might bring honor, but if it truly died, the Lost Continent would have no chance if it failed. Therefore, it chose to leave, first leaving a spark of hope for the Lost Continent.\n\nThe Phoenix left the battlefield in a state of suspended animation and came to the Yangguang Continent. It soon found this volcano located in the Langmu Empire. It passed on its bloodline to the local humans and disseminated its cultivation methods. Afterward, its remaining energy entered the volcano and fell into slumber. These humans were the predecessors of the Phoenix tribe.\n\nThe Phoenix's slumber was a process of cultivation. After slumbering in the volcano for a thousand years, it discovered that it could never recover its original abilities. Its spiritual imprint had been fatally damaged in the fierce final battle on the God-forsaken Continent. All it could retain was a wisp of consciousness and the pure True Phoenix Flame. It was waiting, waiting for the humans of the Phoenix tribe who inherited its bloodline. All it could do was nurture a new Phoenix to replace it. This new Phoenix could be a human in the Phoenix tribe who possessed the Ice Phoenix physique. But how could it know that the scriptures formed from the memory it left to the Phoenix tribe had misunderstood its meaning? Only after ten thousand years was its wish truly fulfilled.\n\nThe Ice Phoenix's energy was extremely yin and frigid. However, as the saying goes, when extreme cold reaches its limit, it transforms in the opposite direction. It was precisely in this transformation that the Yin Fire generated by the Ice Phoenix could inherit the Phoenix's energy and communicate with the Phoenix's residual soul during the eruption of the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony, obtaining the true Phoenix Flame.\n\nThe Phoenix had not expected its wait to be so long. The energy it accumulated was far more immense than it had imagined. But if this energy were to be borne by a human with the Ice Phoenix physique, the outcome would be unknown. However, with its damaged spiritual imprint, it could only gamble. But what it didn't expect was that when the Ice Phoenix was under its control, a pure-blooded Fire Phoenix appeared. Witnessing this situation, the Phoenix was greatly delighted. It was then that it evenly imparted its own True Flames to the sisters Feng Nu and Lan Chen, causing their Phoenix Nine Transformations to leap to the eighth transformation. This was still because their bodies could not fully absorb the True Phoenix Flame. The Phoenix left seeds of True Flame in their bodies. Once the time was right and their power could reach the ninth transformation, two new phoenixes would be born. Although they also possessed human bloodlines, they were still true phoenixes, and there was no doubt about this.\n\nAfter listening to Lan Chen and Feng Nu's narration, Yu Ruyan smiled. Feng Xu, however, bowed solemnly. \"Phoenix Elder Feng Xu, I welcome the two clan leaders. On behalf of the Phoenix tribe, I request the two clan leaders to preside over our tribe's affairs.\" From its inception, the Phoenix tribe had clan leaders, who were the Phoenixes themselves. All members of the Phoenix tribe believed the Phoenix was immortal, so for ten thousand years, they had been waiting for their clan leader's revival. At this moment, Lan Chen and Feng Nu had clearly become the new Phoenixes. While filled with regret, Feng Xu was also brimming with excitement. With these two peerless powerhouses, the Phoenix tribe's spring had finally truly arrived.\n\nFeng Nu stepped forward and helped Feng Xu up. \"Elder, please don't do that. Actually, we ourselves did not know so many things would happen. We are still young, and the overall affairs of the Phoenix tribe still require your experience to preside!\"\n\nFeng Xu smiled slightly and shook his head. \"No, I am truly old. When one is old, their mind becomes slow. Through this Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony, I understand that it is time for our Phoenix tribe to begin its reform, and this reform requires the two clan leaders to complete. No matter what changes you make to the Phoenix tribe's rules, I will always support you. For the future of thousands of Phoenix tribe members, please stay, two clan leaders.\" As he spoke, his gaze fell on Nian Bing with some pleading. He knew that whether Feng Nu and Lan Chen were willing to stay was directly related to Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing remained silent and looked at Feng Nu and Lan Chen. \"You have the right to choose your own destiny. Elder Feng Xu is right; the Phoenix tribe indeed needs you now, needs strong individuals like you to lead the Phoenix tribe's development. There is still some time before my battle with the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, so we will stay with the Phoenix tribe for now. As for your choice then, I will listen to you.\" The situation of the Phoenix Nirvana Grand Ceremony was settled. Nian Bing knew that he would face several difficult moments. In fact, he wanted Feng Nu and Lan Chen to stay, and even Long Ling. That way, his choices would have fewer constraints. Although the strength of Feng Nu and Lan Chen had greatly increased after reaching the eighth transformation, Nian Bing concluded through observation with his Heavenly Eye acupoint that they had just entered the eighth transformation and their strength was still on the verge of the thirteenth rank. If they encountered masters from the Divine Continent, they would still be in danger. Moreover, no one could say for sure what would happen during Xie Yue's ritual to summon back the Lost Continent.",

    "content": "Lan Chen smiled and said, \"What? Do you think I'm fat? Do I need to lose weight?\n\nNian Bing reached out and hugged Lan Chen's slender waist, laughing, \"How could that be? Our Chen Chen has the best figure. Come on, even though it's just potatoes, I promise I'll make sure you all eat deliciously.\" When it came to cooking, no one could intervene. Nian Bing found some rocks nearby and piled them together, then wove a net-like frame from the vines in the thorns and placed it on top. He melted the dirt off the potatoes with ice magic, rinsed them, and then placed them one by one on the frame.\n\nWith a flick of his finger, a ball of flame ignited beneath the vine net, bringing a bit of warmth to the cold weather.\n\nXie Lu said, \"Brother, if you roast potatoes like this, what if the vines break later?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Brother, don't worry. I've infused the vines with earth element, so they won't break easily. Actually, do you know what? This is what I loved to eat most as a child. I remember when my father and I were still together, we lived in Duotian City. I was about five or six years old. Because the disciples of the Rong family treated my father and me badly, I often sneaked out to play alone. Sometimes by myself, sometimes with Brother Rong Bing. We would go to the countryside with some potatoes, build a small stove with stones, and roast potatoes on sticks. It didn't require any special skills or complicated procedures. As long as the potatoes were cooked, the skins would naturally fall off, and then we could just sprinkle some salt on them and eat. Whenever we went to the countryside to roast potatoes, those were the happiest days of my childhood. Although it wasn't considered a delicacy, I truly ate them deliciously back then. Whenever this time came, I would think of my mother. I really miss her.\n\nLan Chen hugged Nian Bing from behind and said softly, \"You'll see her soon. Although Master sealed Sister Bing Ling, she never harmed her and often went to see her. I know that Master never really wanted to kill Sister.\"\n\nNian Bing patted Lan Chen's hand and said, \"Don't worry, I'm fine. Since my father was also taken away by your master, the day I left Chongbing Divine Tower, I learned to be strong. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here today. Come, wait for your roasted potatoes.\"\n\nPotatoes were certainly not a delicacy, but the three of them ate their dinner with unusual sweetness. Lan Chen, who usually didn't eat much, ate a lot today. These potatoes, sprinkled only with salt, seemed to let her see Nian Bing's childhood.\n\nFor them, who possessed great strength, sleep was no longer a necessity. After dinner, the three of them did not fly. They identified their direction and walked towards the Divine Ice Tower.\n\nFeeling the cold air, Bing Yun's complexion became slightly rosy. After all, she had lived in this cold land for nearly twenty years, and this environment was the most suitable for her. At this time, there were still nine days left until the battle between Nian Bing and the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess.\n\nThree days later, Nian Bing and his companions had arrived at Ice Moon City, the capital of the Ice Moon Empire, which was closest to the Divine Ice Tower. Nian Bing did not go to the Ice Moon Empire's imperial palace, nor did he meet his subordinates in the Blood Lion Cult. Upon arriving at Ice Moon City, he found an ordinary inn and checked in. Before facing a major battle, he entered a state of quiet cultivation once more.\n\nDivine Ice Tower.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess stood quietly in her room at the top of the tower, looking at the gray sky outside through the triangular window. Her heart was calm, and her expression was no longer as icy as before. Looking at the distant horizon, she sighed softly, \"What is to come, will eventually come. I have been waiting for this day for a long time. Bing Ling, you have been waiting for a long time too.\"\n\nThere was a knock on the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" a faint frost re-covered the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's face.\n\nThe door opened. A woman in an Ice Snow Priestess robe walked in. She said respectfully, \"Priestess, what are your orders?\"\n\nWith a flash of light in her hand, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess produced a scroll in her palm. \"I will entrust this scroll to you for safekeeping for now. If I die in tomorrow's battle, you will open this scroll and announce my decision in front of all the disciples of the Divine Ice Tower.\"\n\n\"Priestess, you...\" The Ice Snow Priestess's expression changed slightly. Although she looked only in her forties, she was actually over seventy years old, making her one of the oldest disciples of the Divine Ice Tower.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess waved her hand and said, \"Don't say anything more. I have waited too long for this day. Do as I say. Remember my command: no disciples of the Divine Ice Tower are to participate in tomorrow's battle, or they will be punished according to the tower's regulations. Do you understand?\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Priestess wanted to say something more, but looking at the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's icy face, she couldn't bring herself to speak.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's expression softened slightly. \"Don't worry, this might be the best ending for me. Twenty years ago, perhaps I shouldn't have existed in this world. Bing Qing, thank you for your support over the years. Alright, you may leave now.\"\n\nBing Qing silently withdrew from the room. After she closed the door, she couldn't help but sigh and mutter to herself, \"Priestess, why must you do this? Perhaps only I know the pain in your heart.\"\n\nFor exactly one hundred days since Nian Bing and the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess made their agreement, the Divine Ice Tower became exceptionally quiet. At this time, all the disciples of the Divine Ice Tower were sitting in silent cultivation within the tower, their hearts heavy. For the first time in many years, someone dared to challenge the dignity of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess at the Divine Ice Tower, but they were strictly forbidden from participating. They could only wait, believing that as the closest to the gods, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess was invincible.\n\nSilently walking to this land that was both strange and familiar, Nian Bing stopped and looked at the towering castle-like tower not far away. Once upon a time, this place, the most terrifying in his memory, had caused him to wake up from nightmares many times. He had finally arrived, and everything would end today. Everything might also begin today.\n\nThe Divine Ice Tower, like a miniature city, was surrounded by walls as high as fifteen feet. Outside the walls was a moat twenty feet wide, which flowed for only two months each year. The Divine Ice Tower was a mystery to anyone who did not belong there, and it was equally mysterious to Nian Bing. Nian Bing still clearly remembered. The last time he came here with his father, his father's powerful fire magic was swallowed by the vast ice and snow, and his mother and father never even touched each other's clothes until the moment he escaped.\n\n\"Father, Mother, Nian Bing is here,\" Nian Bing called out in his heart, his eyes becoming a little misty. Ten years. Ten years of hard work. He had worked so hard to be able to challenge them honorably today. Ten years, over three thousand days and nights, he had thought of his parents incessantly.\n\nA blue light lit up from the highest point of the Divine Ice Tower, and snowflakes as large as goose feathers swirled around the spire. The weather today was clear and bright. The sky was vast and cloudless. The sudden appearance of snowflakes seemed a little abrupt, but it fit perfectly with the cold surrounding space.\n\nHer body, draped in a blue dress, fluttered amidst the large snowflakes and slowly descended to the ground.\n\nNian Bing's agitated heart calmed down. His golden hair scattered behind him, and his deep blue eyes shone like stars. With determined steps, he walked forward to meet her.\n\n\"You've come,\" the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said, exuding an otherworldly aura as she landed.\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Priestess, you invited me, so how could I not come.\"\n\n\"Are you alone?\" the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess asked faintly.\n\nNian Bing said, \"Our matters should naturally be resolved by ourselves. If I win, please let my parents go.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess replied coldly, \"We'll talk about that after you win.\"\n\nA chilling aura rose around the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, and the piercing aura caused the surrounding air to gradually form a layer of mist, making everything around them blurry. Even the sunlight could not dissipate this ice mist. Golden light emanated from the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's chest, abdomen, and right hand. Her vast aura continuously increased, and a milky white radiance gradually enveloped her body. Her gaze was cold, never leaving Nian Bing's body.\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"It seems my judgment was correct. How could the middle-stage Xijing acupoints not have the Fangjia acupoint? Priestess has been hiding her strength all along, opening four acupoints including the Huangji acupoint. Even on the Continent of Gods, you would absolutely be a top-tier expert.\" Although he spoke, he did not stand idle. A soft, multicolored light slowly revolved around his body. With every opening and closing of his profound eyes, lightning flashed. His previously ordinary demeanor instantly transformed into a sharp blade.\n\nThe two looked at each other. At their level, incantations were no longer important. They could unleash instant magical attacks on each other at any time by activating their acupoints.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess was like an ancient, unmelting block of ice, while Nian Bing was like a drawn sword. For the duration of a meal, neither of them made a move, simply staring at each other. Nian Bing's Tianyan acupoint was fully open, searching for any flaw in the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, but to his surprise, the golden light emanating from the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, combined with the soft white light from the Fangjia acupoint, had rendered her body completely impenetrable.\n\nNian Bing was searching for the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's weakness, and similarly, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess was also looking for his. A magic expert of Nian Bing's level could no longer be destroyed by mere pressure. However, Nian Bing, bathed in the soft multicolored radiance, also showed no flaws. The two stared at each other, each condensing the necessary innate qi. Soon, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess discovered that the innate qi gathered around Nian Bing's body was much more abundant than her own. Although both of their Xijing acupoints were in the middle stage, Nian Bing, relying on the powerful mental strength brought by the Tianyan acupoint, could more easily control the surrounding innate qi. However, he also discovered that while he could weaken any elemental domain of the Tianyan acupoint, he had lost the ability to weaken when facing the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's ice magic. The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, who collected ice elements based on the Huangji acupoint, did not give him such an opportunity.\n\nFinally, it was the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess who moved first because she suddenly felt something was amiss. Although she couldn't quite explain why, she felt that Nian Bing seemed to be intentionally confronting her like this. Moreover, the more abundant the innate qi gathered around Nian Bing's body, the more disadvantageous it was for her, so she chose to attack first.\n\nA large expanse of ice mist rose, instantly enveloping the entire battlefield and obscuring their vision. In that instant, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's attack began. Nian Bing's Tianyan acupoint clearly perceived a massive, sharp, cold force coming straight at him. Without hesitation, his body instantly shifted sideways. At the same time, his Tianyan domain opened wide, pushing back the surrounding ice mist. He reached forward with his right hand, and the Right Hand of the Fire God quietly emerged, meeting the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's attack.\n\nWhat would happen when ice met fire? Anyone could probably tell. The two opposing energies counteracted each other, and whoever had greater strength would gain absolute dominance. The Right Hand of the Fire God that Nian Bing unleashed was no longer simply the Right Hand of the Fire God, because this giant hand was purple.\n\nA huge vortex appeared in the widespread ice mist, and then, a clear space emerged between Nian Bing and the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. The Right Hand of the Fire God disappeared, and the Ice Snow Goddess's attack also vanished. The battle had begun, and there was no reason to stop.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess's body swayed slightly, and in an instant, she transformed into nine. Nine identical figures lined up in an arc before Nian Bing. The Ice Shadow Technique, which condensed ice powder from the air to refract light and create eight illusory bodies. The quality of the Ice Shadow Technique depended on the realism of the illusory shadows. The eight figures conjured by the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess were identical to her true form, and there was no way to discern any flaws. Immediately after, nine enormous ice blades tore through the air, slashing directly at Nian Bing.\n\nThe deep blue ice blades, like purple flames, represented the pinnacle of ice. Nian Bing did not believe that eight of these nine ice blades were fake. The seven divine blades he hadn't seen in a while appeared simultaneously. Immediately after, the blade light converged in the air, and a multicolored radiance emerged. Seven beams of light merged into a solid barrier before Nian Bing, meeting the ice blades attacking from below by the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess head-on.\n\nBoom—, the first loud explosion occurred, and both their bodies swayed simultaneously, retreating three steps. The Ice Snow Goddess Priestess had the defense of the Fangjia acupoint, while Nian Bing had the Tianyan domain. In this first collision, neither of them gained any advantage.",

    "content": "The seven divine sabers paused slightly in mid-air, and then, seven Shadow Puppets appeared simultaneously, transforming into seven beams of light and charging towards the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's nine figures from different directions and positions.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's eyes flashed with cold light. The nine figures merged into one. The golden light in her right hand suddenly intensified, and a deep blue spear appeared in her hand. The spear instantly extended to twenty feet long. As the seven Shadow Puppets closed in from dozens of feet away, the spear had already been immersed in the light of the Emperor's Capital Acupoint and turned golden. Then, with a slight flick of her wrist, the spear shot out silently.\n\nThe golden spear, its icy aura completely restrained, gave Nian Bing a strange feeling. The space around the golden spear was distorting, and facing this spear, his seven Shadow Puppets seemed destined to be hit no matter which direction they advanced. What was going on? Nian Bing was shocked and gained a new understanding of the Emperor's Capital Acupoint.\n\nHe wanted to control his Shadow Puppets to scatter, but at this moment, he found that no matter how he controlled them, his Shadow Puppets seemed to be locked onto by the attractive golden spear. The domineering spear seemed intent on destroying all seven Shadow Puppets simultaneously, with their ultimate destination being his own heart.\n\nNian Bing naturally would not wait for death. His mental power instantly expanded, and the seven Shadow Puppets, which were charging forward at full speed, were forcibly stopped. The seven divine sabers were raised simultaneously, and the seven-colored light condensed into one, with ice as the body, fire as the blade, and the other five elements as the soul. They suddenly slashed forward.\n\nWith a slight smile, Nian Bing brought his hands together in front of him, his eyes flashing with divine light. His mental power was fully concentrated, controlling his seven types of magic power to absorb the innate energy in the air to the greatest extent.\n\nThe golden spear's forward momentum did not appear fast, but when the seven Shadow Puppets' slash was halfway through and their energy had not been fully released, the golden spear had already struck the middle of the seven-colored slash, the point where all energy was most vulnerable.\n\nA sound like shattering glass echoed in Nian Bing's mind. The seven Shadow Puppets were thrown outwards in all directions, and the volume of the golden spear was reduced by half, but it continued to fly towards Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing's expression changed slightly. He hadn't expected the power of the Emperor's Capital Acupoint to be so overbearing, but he vaguely guessed that the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's Emperor's Capital Acupoint was probably no longer as simple as it was in the early stages. At least compared to the last time he saw her, her aura was significantly stronger. Facing the perfect combination of the domineering aura from the Emperor's Capital Acupoint and the ice, Nian Bing, though surprised, was not flustered. He instinctively took a step back. He didn't cast any more magic to defend or attack. Instead, he spread his arms and met the attack with his chest.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess was stunned, a hint of regret flashing in her eyes. However, this Emperor's Capital Ice God Spear was an attack she had unleashed with all her might, and with her mental power, she couldn't retract it. She didn't understand why Nian Bing was doing this. Did he not care about his parents anymore? Did he want to commit suicide? No, that was impossible! No matter how she guessed, she couldn't figure out Nian Bing's current actions.\n\nNian Bing gave the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess the answer with his actions. When the Emperor's Capital Ice God Spear reached him and struck his chest, his body moved slightly, ensuring that the Emperor's Capital Ice God Spear hit the exact location of his Zhonggu Acupoint.\n\nInstantly, Nian Bing clearly felt a domineering aura that seemed capable of tearing everything apart. The sensation of the Emperor's Capital Acupoint was clearly imprinted in his mind. The Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess saw a strange scene. The Emperor's Capital Ice God Spear, as it hit him, turned into specks of golden light and scattered. It didn't shatter on its own; rather, it was ground into powder by a black and white mixed airflow that erupted from Nian Bing's chest. The Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess clearly felt that the immense airflow was terrifying, containing two completely opposite auras. Although it was only a fleeting moment, under the influence of the aura, she felt a dullness in her chest, and an unspeakable pain spread throughout her body. She couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of blood with a \"wow,\" and only then felt much better. Just as Nian Bing had felt when facing the Emperor's Capital Ice God Spear, she was now filled with shock. What power was that spatial energy?\n\nNian Bing's condition was no better than the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's. His face turned pale, and he also spat out a mouthful of blood. Staggering back a few steps, he finally managed to steady himself.\n\nAlthough Nian Bing's physical strength was extremely high, he couldn't withstand the attack of the Emperor's Capital Ice God Spear. The reason he was unharmed was because of his Zhonggu Acupoint. Before leaving the Continent of Gods, Kao had told him that although he couldn't use the Zhonggu Acupoint due to the absorption of the Death Sphere, at that point, not only was there the Death Sphere, but also the Life Sphere. Both of these energies were the purest and most immense energies in the world. Although Nian Bing couldn't use them, that point of his Zhonggu Acupoint had become the most solid point. Kao and Tianxiang had both said that even they, if they were to attack only that point, would not be able to harm Nian Bing. Therefore, when Nian Bing saw that the Emperor's Capital Ice God Spear from the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess was a point attack, he boldly chose to face it in such a manner. It was precisely by relying on the powerful auras of life and death that he was able to turn the disadvantageous situation into a balanced one. Nian Bing was injured not because his Zhonggu Acupoint was breached, but because the energy generated by the explosion of the Emperor's Capital Ice God Spear had a certain vibrational effect on his body, which was something he had not anticipated, thus causing him injury.\n\nThe seven Shadow Puppets returned to Nian Bing's side, but their energy bodies, which were almost solid, had become somewhat illusory. The power of the seven divine sabers had not been fully unleashed. Facing the domineering Emperor's Capital Ice God Spear, their own energy had suffered significant damage. With the help of the mental power from Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye Acupoint, the seven Shadow Puppets continuously absorbed the innate energy in the air to replenish themselves.\n\nNian Bing looked at the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess and said, \"As expected of the greatest magician who has roamed the continent for many years, you are truly well-hidden!\"\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess replied, \"Aren't you the same? You have many more secrets than I do.\"\n\nNian Bing touched his chest and said, \"Secrets are relative, esteemed Priestess. Let us continue.\" The seven Shadow Puppets disappeared. They all had their own souls. Nian Bing absolutely did not want to see them suffer fatal damage, as that would not only represent his divine sabers but also Black Wu Huang and the six Dwarf masters.\n\nThe seven divine sabers floated around Nian Bing's body. The Ice and Snow Goddess's Sigh and the Roar of the God of War entered his control. With a slight flick of his wrist, two divine sabers drew a huge triangle, and the surging ice and fire energies harmoniously condensed together, forming an ice-and-fire dual-element magic array. It had been a long time since he had used his most proficient skills. However, facing the formidable Emperor's Capital Acupoint of the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, Nian Bing dared not hold back any longer, so he unleashed his full power.\n\nNian Bing's ice magic was naturally not as powerful as the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's, but he also had fire magic. Two figures gradually appeared behind his body. The three-zhang-tall figure had appeared once in the Phoenix clan: a graceful figure in a blue dress, and a roaring fire god in fiery red armor. They appeared behind him. The two sabers in Nian Bing's hands disappeared simultaneously, and the six-pointed star he had drawn was already emanating its aura within a ten-zhang radius. Ice and fire, two different auras, continuously rose around his body. One blue and one red, two beams of light descended from the sky, falling onto the two figures, causing their illusory bodies to gradually become clearer.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's expression changed repeatedly. \"Summoning of the Ice and Snow Goddess, Summoning of the God of Fire. Has your Western Meridian Acupoint reached the ultimate stage?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head. Even at this moment, he could still speak, \"No, my Western Meridian Acupoint, like yours, is only at the intermediate stage. However, there is something you probably never knew. With the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, even though my Western Meridian Acupoint is only at the intermediate stage, combined with the control of energy from the mental power in the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, I can completely unleash the power of the ultimate Western Meridian Acupoint. Come, receive my strongest ice-and-fire dual-element attack.\"\n\nAlthough the power of the Seven Forbidden Seven Absolute Curses was immense, the magic power and mental power it consumed were also extraordinarily vast. By linking the seven different magics into a chain reaction, it unleashed an attack far greater than the combined force of the seven magics. However, the Seven Forbidden Seven Absolute Curses also had their own drawbacks, which was the extremely long time it took to condense energy. Furthermore, it couldn't bring all of their energy to its peak, only maintaining the power of an eleventh-tier forbidden curse. The ice-and-fire dual-divinity summoning that Nian Bing was currently performing was different. As a master of the ice-and-fire dual elements, ice and fire magic were his most proficient skills. As the illusory figures gradually turned into solid forms, these two eleventh-tier forbidden curses had entered the power level of a twelfth-tier divine descent technique. When Nian Bing's ice-and-fire dual elements could only unleash fourth or fifth-tier magic, the combined attack of ice and fire could already double its power. And the joint use of the two ice and fire divine descent techniques, manifested in the form of ice-and-fire dual elements, could only be described as terrifying.\n\nAlthough Nian Bing's body was already injured, he still chose this method of attack without hesitation. This was not because he had gone mad, but because he had absolute confidence. Although the ultimate Heavenly Eye Acupoint had enhanced the ability of physical mental power attacks, the mental power it consumed was immense. Nian Bing could completely control these two divine descent techniques with his vast mental power. With the significant release of his own magic power, combined with the innate energy brought by the fusion of the Heavenly Eye Acupoint and the Western Meridian Acupoint, the energy of the ice and fire dual deities was continuously condensing.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess raised her spear, and the God of Fire raised his battle saber. The powerful attack was about to be unleashed.\n\nIf the Emperor's Capital Acupoint was the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's greatest reliance, then the ice-and-fire dual elements were Nian Bing's strongest ability.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess looked at the increasingly clear Ice and Snow Goddess before her, and a sense of amusement arose in her heart. As the Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess, she was actually going to face the attack of her own faith. However, from the moment Nian Bing began to condense his magic power, she had also started to act.\n\nRaising her head, she looked at the azure sky. All the ice mist had dispersed, and layers of deep blue ice crystals condensed on the surface of her body. Her right hand slowly pointed towards the sky, and golden light covered her body. Wrapped in the ice crystals, her body was soon propelled to become a body encased in deep blue solid ice. As the solid ice continued to increase, her body gradually expanded, while her raised right hand continuously emitted layers of golden luster, dyeing the deep blue ice crystals golden.\n\nNian Bing's expression changed slightly. He realized that the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess was also performing an Ice and Snow Goddess Summoning, but her summoning was much more powerful than his. Under the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's summoning, a figure appeared before him, wearing blue armor, no, golden armor. That golden body, besides its icy aura, also possessed holiness and majesty. An immense aura continuously spread outwards. As her body also expanded to three zhang, it coincided with the moment Nian Bing's condensed magic power reached its peak.\n\nWithout any hesitation, Nian Bing's forehead turned completely golden. Without the confidence to defeat the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, he desperately activated his peculiar acupoints that were fused together.\n\nAn unexpected event occurred. As the golden Ice and Snow Goddess formed by the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's condensation generated immense pressure from the golden light at Nian Bing's forehead, her originally extremely majestic body actually swayed, and the golden light on her body weakened slightly.\n\nNian Bing's eyes lit up. He knew his chance had arrived. The two enormous figures behind him, which had become solid, glided out with red and blue afterimages, charging out at a speed imperceptible to the naked eye. The battle saber of the God of Fire and the spear of the Ice and Snow Goddess met in mid-air. Red and blue light instantly expanded to every corner of the surroundings. Two giant saber shadows appeared behind them, which were precisely the Ice and Snow Goddess's Sigh – the Morning Dew Saber – and the God of Fire's Roar – the Sunward Saber.\n\nThe strongest ice-and-fire dual-element magic that Nian Bing could unleash, the two divine descent techniques condensed with ice and fire, erupted.\n\nThe sky changed. The azure sky suddenly pushed out its radiance. Everything around seemed to disappear in an instant, and both Nian Bing and the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess arrived in another realm. Everything around turned into an ice-fire hell. The ice-and-fire dual-element spring of the Dual Divinity Summoning, in an instant, unleashed power that surpassed that of the Seven Forbidden Seven Absolute Curses from seven days ago.",

    "content": "The golden Ice and Snow Goddess, after a brief moment of stunned silence, immediately reacted. Her body and spear became one, and a massive cone of golden light shot straight towards the ice and fire hell. The power of the Imperial Acupoint was raised to its limit, and the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess revealed her true strength.\n\nThe four major acupoints simultaneously released all their energy, which condensed at the Lì Zhōng acupoint, causing years of cultivated energy to explode in an instant. The congenital qi absorbed by the Xī Jīng acupoint and the defensive energy released by the Fāng Jiǎ acupoint were completely fused into the golden Ice and Snow Goddess. As both sides knew that skill could no longer be the deciding factor, they both chose the most primitive method of attack: energy collision.\n\nThrough the Tiān Yǎn acupoint, Niàn Bīng could truly see every change in the energy from the moment it attacked until it made contact. The golden, red, and blue light instantly merged together, changing the colors of heaven and earth, and the ground trembled. It was the power of an ending.\n\nDestruction. They brought destruction. Niàn Bīng himself never expected that their strongest attacks would bring such terrifying results.\n\nThe three beams of light caused everything around them to lose its brilliance. Both Niàn Bīng and the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess felt their six senses disappear in an instant. Even Niàn Bīng's Tiān Yǎn acupoint could only maintain a sliver of clarity.\n\nThere was no massive explosion as imagined. Everything around them seemed to have disappeared...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Niàn Bīng's six senses gradually returned to him. He naturally remembered that he had promised Lán Chén not to kill her master, but in that moment, he had no other choice. If he hadn't gone all out, it would have been death. The Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess, who had hidden most of her strength, was even stronger than ordinary Earth God level experts on the Divine Continent!\n\nEverything gradually returned to calm. What Niàn Bīng saw was a scene he would never forget. The Ice God Tower had disappeared. All he could see was the earth and rocks in the distance. The ground was as smooth as a mirror, as if it had formed a layer of crystal, shimmering with faint blue and red. Looking up at the sky, he felt as if he had entered a basin, surrounded by towering mountains. But why were these mountains flat? The mountain walls, hundreds of feet high, were also exceptionally smooth, even similar in structure to the ground.\n\nThe air was filled with scorching fire elements and violent ice elements. These two elements permeated the entire basin with a faint mist of red and blue. Niàn Bīng slowly stood up from the ground. He found that his clothes were not damaged, not even a speck of dust. The surroundings were unusually quiet.\n\nHow did I get here? This was the question Niàn Bīng wanted to ask the most, but on the ground that spanned tens of square kilometers, no one could answer him. Niàn Bīng found that the canyon was long and narrow, extending horizontally to both sides, and at a glance, he couldn't see the end.\n\nHe coughed, and a dull pain in his chest eased slightly with the nourishment of the life essence contained within the Orb of Life. He subconsciously reached up to his face and felt a hand full of blood. When he condensed an ice mirror to look at himself, he was startled. Was this person bleeding from all seven orifices himself? I didn't die, so what was the outcome of the battle?\n\nAs he looked around and pondered his location, a graceful figure staggered to her feet about two hundred feet away. Her movements were somewhat slow. Her blue hair was disheveled, and it was the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess did not bleed from all seven orifices like Niàn Bīng, but her pretty face had turned as white as paper. As soon as she stood up, the first thing she said was: I'm not dead yet? Why am I not dead yet?\n\nNiàn Bīng looked at the woman he had always considered his strongest opponent with amusement. \"Do you think dying is so easy? If you have too many responsibilities on your shoulders, it's not that easy to die. Where are we?\"\n\nNiàn Bīng shook his head and said, \"That's what I wanted to ask you too.\"\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess's senses gradually cleared. She felt the turbulent magic elements in the air, looked at the vast basin nearly a thousand feet wide with no discernible end, and said somewhat blankly, \"How would I know where this is?\" Her body swayed, and she let out a \"wow\" as she vomited a mouthful of blood.\n\nJust as Niàn Bīng was about to mock his opponent, his entire body's meridians ached, and he also began to spit blood. Both their bodies swayed simultaneously, and they both fell to the ground. They both knew that the battle was not over. No matter where they were, one of them had to emerge as the victor today.\n\nLooking at each other, they each desperately absorbed the turbulent magic elements in the air with their own abilities.\n\nNiàn Bīng discovered through internal observation that more than seventy percent of his magic power had been consumed. Although the most powerful Ice and Fire Originating Magic had absorbed a large amount of congenital qi, it had also consumed most of his energy. However, he was fortunate that both the Ice and Fire Divine Blades had returned to his body and were not lost, although their light had dimmed considerably, indicating the enormous consumption of energy. They didn't know how powerful their attack had been, nor did they know what level of destructive power their energy explosion had reached.\n\nAfter only the time it takes to eat a meal, the Ice and Snow Goddess was the first to stand up from the ground. Niàn Bīng saw the golden light flashing in her right hand. Niàn Bīng also stood up, unleashing a faint seven-colored halo without showing weakness.\n\n\"I have a suggestion. How about we go up and see where we are before we fight again?\" Niàn Bīng said.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess snorted dismissively. \"Can you still fly?\"\n\nNiàn Bīng let out a cold snort, \"Don't underestimate your opponent.\" He stomped on the ground and leaped high into the air. Gray light points condensed beneath him, and a clear dragon's roar echoed through the valley. The Little Dragon King finally appeared.\n\nIt wasn't that Niàn Bīng didn't want him to help, but in the previous battle, Niàn Bīng had refused the Little Dragon King's repeated offers to fight. Oscar was the only child of the Light Dragon King and the Dark Dragon King, and also Niàn Bīng's friend. He absolutely did not want his friend to be seriously injured because of his affairs. The strength of the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess was far beyond his expectations, so he would rather face her himself than let Oscar get involved and be harmed in any way.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess looked at the seven-zhang-long gray giant dragon with surprise. Her expression changed slightly, but after a moment, it returned to normal. A hint of faint melancholy flashed in her beautiful eyes. A snowstorm appeared beneath her feet, lifting her body as she floated away, heading towards the mountain valley hundreds of feet high.\n\nNiàn Bīng and she maintained a certain distance. As they reached the summit, they were stunned because they finally discovered where they were.\n\nIn front of the Ice God Tower, where Niàn Bīng and the Ice Goddess Priestess had previously fought, there was a vast plain where only a few cold-resistant plants could grow. The flat plain was very suitable for carriages to travel. And right in the center of this plain, it had now become unrecognizable. A deep沟渠 (gōuqú - ditch/chasm), spanned the plain. This was the valley where they had been before!\n\nNiàn Bīng stared blankly at the hundreds of anxious ice mages by the side of the ditch, then looked at the still majestic Ice God Tower not far away. He knew that all of this was real. His gaze fell on the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess. \"Did we do all of this?\"\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's surprise was no less than Niàn Bīng's. Such a massive destructive force, extending to the distant enormous ditch, deeply shocked her. She felt a sense of lingering fear. If the explosive force generated by their collision had not been horizontal but vertical or circular, the Ice God Tower would likely have ceased to exist.\n\nHundreds of ice mages looked at Niàn Bīng and the Ice Goddess Priestess flying in the sky, their eyes filled with strong awe. Having caused such a scene, could they still be called human? Was this the work of mortals?\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess sternly shouted, \"Have you forgotten what I said? Who told you to leave without my command? All of you, go back.\"\n\n\"Priestess.\" All the ice mages knelt down. Bing Qing, kneeling at the very front, said with tears streaming down her face, \"Let us face the crisis of the Ice God Tower together...\"\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's expression turned extremely cold. \"I'll say it again. All of you, go back, or from today onwards, the Ice God Tower will cease to exist.\"\n\nThe ice mages did not expect the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess to say this. They silently got up and left.\n\nNiàn Bīng quietly watched the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess do all this, and a sense of admiration arose in his heart. \"Priestess, do you think you still have a chance?\" As he spoke, a milky white glow rose around Niàn Bīng's body, symbolizing the milky white glow of the Fāng Jiǎ acupoint. Although on the surface, he looked more tragic, in reality, his injuries were lighter than the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess's. During his cultivation in the Phoenix clan, he had opened the Fāng Jiǎ acupoint, and due to the effects of Tiān Yǎn and Huáng Jí, it had reached the intermediate stage as soon as it was opened. As a powerful expert who had opened five acupoints, even though three of them could not be truly used, in terms of overall strength, he was now comparable to the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess turned to Niàn Bīng. Through the previous battle, she certainly felt that the gap between her strength and Niàn Bīng's was very small, and Niàn Bīng's powerful combat strength had left a deep impression on her. If it were just a battle between them, she firmly believed that with the Imperial Acupoint, she would still have a chance. However, looking at the dragon beneath Niàn Bīng's feet and the gray scales gradually emerging from Niàn Bīng's body, she knew she had reached a dead end. However, her eyes did not change at all, and she said calmly, \"Our battle is to the death. Killing me is your true victory.\"\n\nNiàn Bīng took a deep breath. Did one of them really have to die before they would let go? Chenchen told me that you didn't kill my parents. As long as you release them, our battle is unnecessary. I don't want to continue the grievances of more than ten years. It's not too late to let go now.\"\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess smiled. This was the first time Niàn Bīng had seen her smile, but her smile was somewhat crazed, somewhat mournful. \"Stop?\" If I had been able to stop more than twenty years ago, then I wouldn't be who I am today.\"\n\nNiàn Bīng said, \"Do we really have to self-destruct our acupoints to end this battle?\"\n\nThe Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess said coldly, \"Self-destructing acupoints? That's something only cowards would do. As the master of the Ice God Tower, I will never make that choice. For so many years, you are the first person to see my true strength.\" As she spoke, her body suddenly changed. The original blue light was overlaid with layers of red light.\n\nIf he weren't sitting on Oscar, Niàn Bīng would have probably fallen on the spot. His eyes showed an expression of extreme shock. \"No. This is impossible. You, how are you also an Ice and Fire Originating Mage?\"\n\nThe red light emanating from the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess was something Niàn Bīng was very familiar with. That was the symbol of the two magic elements of Ice and Fire Originating! What surprised Niàn Bīng was not that her strength suddenly increased. Even if she were a dual-element mage, she couldn't defeat him now. But how could she be a dual-element mage?\n\n\"Senior Sister, stop,\" a trembling voice came from afar. That heavenly voice not only made Niàn Bīng's body freeze but also caused the Ice and Snow Goddess Priestess to instantly freeze.",

    "content": "Far away, four figures flashed towards their location like lightning. The Priestess of the Ice Goddess trembled all over. She never imagined she would face such a situation.\n\nUnlike the Priestess of the Ice Goddess, when Nian Bing heard the ecstatic, celestial sound, his body trembled violently. The next moment, he had detached from Oscar's body, condensed all his remaining energy, and, propelled by the wind, rushed towards the four figures at maximum speed.\n\nTen years. Although it had been a full ten years, that voice was still so familiar, so dear. Every drop of blood in Nian Bing's body boiled at this moment. He had waited for this moment for far too long.\n\nStill several yards away from the four figures, Nian Bing suddenly fell to his knees. Due to his rapid forward momentum, his body slid forward another yard before stopping. His clothes, which had not been damaged during the fight with the Priestess of the Ice Goddess, were now slightly torn at the knees. However, Nian Bing could not attend to anything else at this moment, his gaze completely focused on the four people before him.\n\nThe four arrived almost side by side. On the far left was Bing Yun, dressed in a blue magic robe. Since awakening the Royal Feathers, she no longer needed magic to fly. Her massive blue wings allowed her to soar through the air at will. On the far right was the dwarf warrior Xi Lu, clad in black armor, with faint black energy swirling around his body. Although his aura was restrained, one could still feel his powerful inner presence.\n\nThe two in the middle were dressed in ordinary cloth robes, but even these could not conceal their extraordinary bearing. The one on the left was tall, with long golden hair cascading over his broad shoulders. His handsome face was as chiseled as if carved by a knife. A ball of flame burned beneath his feet, propelling him forward. Nian Bing resembled him in seven out of ten facial features, but this person appeared more mature. The ravages of time had left some traces on his face. While he lacked some of Nian Bing's youthful spirit, he possessed more maturity. Beside him stood a woman with blue hair reaching her waist, appearing to be in her late twenties. Her sapphire eyes were filled with emotion, and tears flowed down her face in her excitement, causing her body to tremble slightly.\n\n\"Dad, Mom.\" The simple two words broke the silence of the air in Nian Bing's choked voice, as if everything had stopped. Lan Chen and Xi Lu stood aside, watching the middle-aged couple approach Nian Bing. They were Nian Bing's parents, Rong Tian and Bing Ling! Ten years. The family of three finally reunited before the Ice God Tower. Everything seemed to have changed, but their familial bond had never weakened.\n\nBefore Nian Bing began his battle with the Priestess of the Ice Goddess, fearing she might break her promise after the fight, he had instructed Lan Chen and Xi Lu to sneak into the Ice God Tower from another direction. Although the Ice God Tower was heavily guarded, Lan Chen was intimately familiar with the tower's arrangements. With the help of the Dark Demon Rats, they entered the Ice God Tower through underground passages. Led by Lan Chen, they found the location where Rong Tian and Bing Ling were sealed. With the strength of Xi Lu and Lan Chen, they forcibly broke the seal from the outside and rescued Nian Bing's parents.\n\nThey arrived just as Nian Bing and the Priestess of the Ice Goddess were about to fight to the death.\n\nEvery step Bing Ling took forward was difficult. Seeing Nian Bing, who was weeping before her, her heart trembled violently. Nian Bing, kneeling on the ground, crawled forward a few steps on his knees, looking at his mother from a short distance. \"Mom, it's Nian Bing, it's Nian Bing!\"\n\nBing Ling could no longer contain her emotions. With a heartbroken cry, \"Child,\" she embraced him tightly. Mother and son wept uncontrollably, the years of separation and pent-up emotions erupting in an instant. Their hearts trembled, and profound familial love surged through every tiny part of their bodies. Nian Bing had finally seen his parents again, his lifelong wish fulfilled in an instant. His grief and suppressed emotions of years past burst forth.\n\nRong Tian stepped forward, his lips trembling, unable to control his tears, which were tears of pure joy. Opening his broad, strong arms, he embraced his beloved wife and son. They were reunited, the family of three finally together.\n\nThe Priestess of the Ice Goddess had landed at the edge of the chasm and watched Bing Ling's family reunite. A complex light flickered in her eyes. She stood there without moving, and the light emanating from her body gradually dimmed. Xi Lu kept his gaze fixed on the Priestess of the Ice Goddess, his Godslayer Axe flickering with black lightning. If the Priestess of the Ice Goddess made a move against Nian Bing's family, he would not hesitate to launch his strongest attack.\n\nThe Priestess of the Ice Goddess's gaze fell on Lan Chen. Seeing the blue wings behind her, a hint of surprise appeared. After a brief moment of astonishment, her gaze softened considerably. \"You released them?\"\n\nLan Chen folded her wings and knelt down with a thud, lowering her head. \"Master, it was me. Nian Bing and they have suffered enough. Master, I am sorry, I disobeyed your wishes. But, I do not regret it.\"\n\nThe Priestess of the Ice Goddess did not blame Lan Chen. With a soft sigh, she said, \"You have grown up. Perhaps, this is the best outcome. Get up. I am not your master.\"\n\nLan Chen's body shook, and she exclaimed, \"Master, you...\"\n\nThe Priestess of the Ice Goddess said calmly, \"I am not speaking in anger. Jie was never your master. Perhaps, this is the best outcome. Now, they also have the ability to protect themselves, and they have such an outstanding son. No matter what happens in the future, I believe their family will be able to face it well. It is over, everything should be over.\"\n\nAt this moment, seeing the sudden appearance of Lan Chen and the other three, the disciples of the Ice God Tower quietly gathered around, forming a semi-circle behind them. At the mere command of the Priestess of the Ice Goddess, they would immediately attack without hesitation.\n\n\"Child, you have grown up.\" Bing Ling helped Nian Bing, who was kneeling on the ground, to stand. Looking at his figure, which was a bit taller than Rong Tian, and at his blood-stained face, Bing Ling's eyes were filled with affection. Her son, her son had grown into a man, becoming as handsome as his father, and possessing such great strength. It was enough, this was enough. What more could satisfy her than this?\n\nNian Bing wiped away his tears and looked at his mother, who seemed to have changed little with the years. His heart continued to tremble. \"Mom, Mom—\"\n\nHow many years had it been? How he longed to call out to his mother like this! Now his mother stood before him, yet it felt like a dream. His current feelings could not be described as mere excitement.\n\n\"Yes! Our child has grown up. He is a true man.\" Rong Tian wiped away his tears, looking at his son with immense pride. Although the previous battle had not ended, the huge chasm before them had proven everything. Ten years. After ten years, his son had come here with his strength to save his wife and himself. He had grown up. The tempering of the world had turned him into a strong figure on the continent. What could make him prouder than having such a son?\n\n\"Bing Qing, come here.\" The Priestess of the Ice Goddess's suddenly raised voice startled the family of three. They all turned their gazes towards the supreme ruler of the Ice God Tower.\n\nBing Qing emerged from the crowd of Ice God Tower disciples and, under the influence of the blizzard, reached the Priestess of the Ice Goddess at maximum speed and knelt down.\n\nThe Priestess of the Ice Goddess said calmly, \"I never expected the final outcome to be like this. Everything is different from what I imagined. Bing Qing, give me that scroll. It seems the contents of the scroll will have to be announced by me personally.\"\n\nAt this moment, the area before the Ice God Tower fell silent. Taking the scroll handed to her by Bing Qing, a golden light flashed in the Priestess of the Ice Goddess's hand, and the scroll turned into powder, scattering in the wind. Her gaze was calm as she looked at Bing Ling's family, a hint of sadness on her face. \"Why did you stop me? Do I not even have the right to choose my own destiny? I have lived half my life for others. Why would you still interfere with my final decision?\"\n\nBing Ling looked at the Priestess of the Ice Goddess. Her initial excitement at seeing Nian Bing gradually subsided. With a sigh, she said with some bitterness, \"Sister, why do you put yourself through this? Life is not just about suffering! For your own sake, you should live well, live for yourself, and take care of yourself.\"\n\nStanding beside Bing Ling, Nian Bing was slightly taken aback. Why would his mother call the Priestess of the Ice Goddess \"Sister\"? His mother seemed to have called her that when she first appeared. But at that time, he thought he had misheard. Now, his mother's words proved he hadn't. But wasn't the Priestess of the Ice Goddess his master? How could the generation gap be so confused?\n\nA deep look appeared in the Priestess of the Ice Goddess's eyes. \"Live for myself? Can I still live for myself? You say it so easily! Can I start over? In my early years, I lived for my father's revenge. Later, I lived for my master. Now, I am powerless to continue the mission left by my master. Perhaps, I truly have the right to choose my own future. But, can I still?\"\n\nBing Ling said emotionally, \"Yes, of course, you can. Sister, as long as you are willing to try, I believe you will find yourself again and regain everything you deserve. Nothing is over, far from over. For your life, you should seek! Sister, you carry too much on your mind. It's time for a change. Forget everything from the past and start anew. I want to see you smile from your heart like we did when we were young. I want to see the good sister you once were. Don't torture yourself anymore. You have suffered enough. Promise me, okay? You don't need to think about anything else. Everything has become history. We must look forward, always forward.\"\n\nThe Priestess of the Ice Goddess took a deep breath, her full chest rising and falling. At this moment, she seemed liberated, exhaling a long sigh. \"Yes! Perhaps, I really should look forward. Only by casting aside all attachments can I do what I want to do. Bing Qing, and all disciples of the Ice God Tower, hear my command.\"\n\nLan Chen remained kneeling, and Bing Ling also knelt. They had never stopped considering themselves disciples of the Ice God Tower. All other disciples also knelt. The only ones remaining standing were Nian Bing and his father, the Priestess of the Ice Goddess, and Xi Lu, the four of them.\n\nThe Priestess of the Ice Goddess's voice became very calm. \"From today onwards, I will sever ties with the Ice God Tower. From now on, I will have no further relationship with the Ice God Tower.\" As soon as she spoke, a ripple of astonishment went through the crowd. All the disciples of the Ice God Tower focused their gazes on the Priestess of the Ice Goddess, their eyes filled with shock. Only a faint smile appeared on Bing Ling's lips. Nian Bing looked at the Priestess of the Ice Goddess in surprise; he didn't understand what was happening.\n\nThe Priestess of the Ice Goddess's eyes radiated authority. Years of accumulated prestige made all the disciples bow their heads. No one dared to utter any words of doubt. The Priestess of the Ice Goddess said calmly, \"After I leave, the position of Priestess of the Ice Goddess of the Ice God Tower will be inherited by Bing Ling. From today onwards, you will all obey her commands. As the Tower Master of this tower, she has the right to change any tower rules. You do not need to doubt her strength. Our Ice God Tower does not have only me as a Divine Descendant Master; Bing Ling's strength is no less than mine. The Ice God Tower will forever remain the Ice God Tower it was. I am leaving. Perhaps, all of this has truly become an illusion. Chen Chen, remember, if we have a chance to meet again in the future, you may call me 'Sister'.\"\n\nAfter saying all this, the Priestess of the Ice Goddess appeared much more relaxed. Although there was still no smile on her face, her gaze had become very peaceful. Looking at the distant horizon, she seemed to be contemplating something.\n\nThe disciples of the Ice God Tower remained kneeling. The sudden change was indeed difficult for them to accept. The older disciples of the Ice God Tower certainly knew of Bing Ling's existence. They never imagined that the Priestess of the Ice Goddess would suddenly pass the position of Tower Master to her. Everyone harbored doubts, but they dared not disobey the wishes of the Priestess of the Ice Goddess.\n\n\"Have you all understood what I said?\" The voice, carrying a hint of remoteness, came from the Priestess of the Ice Goddess.\n\nBing Qing was the first to respond, \"Yes, Your Eminence. However, no matter what decision you make, you will always be our Eminence.\" Saying this, she respectfully kowtowed three times to the Priestess of the Ice Goddess. Among those present, besides Bing Ling, only she knew how much the Priestess of the Ice Goddess had sacrificed for the Ice God Tower. At this point, she would absolutely not stop the Priestess of the Ice Goddess from leaving, because she knew that only by truly leaving could the Priestess of the Ice Goddess possibly live a happy life of her own.",

    "content": "All the disciples of the Ice God Pagoda made the same movements as Bing Qing.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess’s gaze fell on Bing Ling. Bing Ling stood up and walked step by step in front of her, smiling, \"Sister, you've finally come to your senses. Go, do as you think best. I believe our sisters will meet again, but at that time, I hope to see a completely different you. Don't worry about the Ice God Pagoda; I will do my best. It's time for me to take over this responsibility.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess revealed a faint smile, took Bing Ling's hand, and said, \"On behalf of our master, I forgive you.\"\n\nBing Ling trembled all over, \"Sister...\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess smiled and said, \"Do you know? Actually, until the day our master died, she never truly blamed you. She loved you too much. In her heart, your position was always more important than mine. Although I received everything that should have belonged to you, neither of us was happy. Now, it's truly time to change everything. After I leave, you can change anything in the Ice God Pagoda without worry. Our master, if she knew, would support you. The tragedy that happened to us should not happen to the disciples. I believe you understand what I mean.\"\n\nBing Ling nodded and said, \"Sister, when do you plan to leave?\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess said, \"There's no need to pick a special day; I'm leaving now. I am no longer a member of the Ice God Pagoda. You are the new Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. I believe the Ice God Pagoda will flourish even more in your hands, won't it?\"\n\nShe released Bing Ling's hand, and a faint wind and snow condensed beneath her feet. Her beautiful, delicate body slowly lifted off the ground. Wrapped in a faint blue light, she ascended into the sky. She was leaving, leaving the place she had spent almost her entire life.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" Nian Bing shouted urgently. As he spoke, he dashed to his mother's side.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess looked at him calmly. \"Let's consider today's battle my loss. If we continued fighting, you would have been the victor, just with different degrees of damage. Your parents are already by your side. Is there anything else you need?\"\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath. \"Priestess, I think I will continue to address you this way. Although I don't know the exact relationship between you and my mother, saving my parents is the most important thing for me coming to the Ice God Pagoda. At the same time, I want to ask you something. I hope you can answer me, alright?\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess was slightly stunned. \"What do you want to ask? Go ahead and ask.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"I heard your Pagoda has a disciple named Bing Jie, is that right? May I ask where she is now?\" He had asked Lan Chen about Bing Jie, but Lan Chen had told him blankly that there was no such person in the Ice God Pagoda.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess Priestess and Nian Bing's mother, Bing Ling, were both stunned for a moment. After exchanging a glance, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess looked up at the sky and sighed, \"There used to be someone named Bing Jie in the Ice God Pagoda. However, the Bing Jie of today is dead.\" Without another word, her body suddenly accelerated, heading into the distance.\n\nNian Bing watched somewhat blankly as the blue figure gradually turned into a blue dot. He couldn't help but feel a little dejected. \"Dead. So, there really was such a person. She's dead. Perhaps this is the best outcome. Master, I bless you. I hope you can meet in the afterlife.\" The name Bing Jie that Nian Bing spoke of was told to him by the God of Cooking, Zi Xiu. Back then, he had a cooking competition with the God of Cooking to obtain information about his master's enemy. Finally, after losing the competition, the God of Cooking told him this name and that Bing Jie was a disciple of the Ice God Pagoda. Nian Bing found it strange at the time because his master lost to fire magic, so why would this person be a disciple of the Ice God Pagoda? She was his master's lifelong love and had also harmed him for half his life. Coming to the Ice God Pagoda, his main purpose was to save his parents, and he also longed to meet this person, not for revenge, because he knew very well that his master did not wish for him to avenge him. Having lived with Cha Ji for eight years, Nian Bing understood that although Cha Ji resented that woman somewhat, his feelings were more of love. He had never forgotten the woman named Bing Jie.\n\n\"Child, how did you know about Bing Jie?\" Bing Ling asked with some curiosity.\n\nNian Bing said, \"I heard it from a senior. Mom, is Bing Jie really dead?\"\n\nBing Ling sighed and said, \" The Bing Jie of the past is indeed dead. I know you must have many questions you want to ask me now. Let's go back to the Ice God Pagoda first. Bing Qing Sister, please lead the disciples of this Pagoda back to their posts.\"\n\nBing Qing respectfully replied, \"Yes, Priestess.\" As she spoke, she stood up and issued several commands. The somewhat dazed disciples of the Ice God Pagoda then retreated into the Ice God Pagoda one by one.\n\nBing Ling took Nian Bing's hand, and on the other side, she held her husband. Together with Lan Chen and Xun Lu, they also entered the Ice God Pagoda.\n\nUpon entering the Ice God Pagoda, Nian Bing realized it was indeed a magical place. All the decorations inside the pagoda were made of crystal-like ice. Under the refraction of the light outside the window, it gave off a dazzling beauty, as if they were in a crystal palace.\n\n\"Child, this Ice God Pagoda was built by our master using thousand-year-old cold ice brought back from the far north with her powerful magic. It consumed a large amount of manpower and resources. Cultivating in this Pagoda is twice as effective for ice mages. Look, every piece of ice bears the trace of our master!\"\n\nNian Bing glanced at Lan Chen beside him. The doubts in his heart grew stronger. Wasn't his mother's master the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess? But why did she call the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess \"Sister\" earlier? What was going on?\n\nEveryone arrived at the top of the Ice God Pagoda, in the exclusive room of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess. Inside the room, everything was tidied up very cleanly. In the center was a huge circular ice bed with a diameter of one zhang. A faint ice mist emanated from the blue ice bed, bringing a touch of coldness to the room.\n\nBing Ling smiled and said, \"This bed is what our master was most proud of. Although it's not a divine artifact, it's carved from a single piece of ice jade, which is very rare and the essence of ice. Bing Yun, I believe you've also cultivated on this bed.\"\n\nLan Chen nodded and said, \"Yes, this is something unique to our Ice God Pagoda. Only the Pagoda Master and her direct disciples can cultivate on it. If it weren't for this ice jade bed, my magic wouldn't have improved so quickly.\"\n\nBing Ling released her husband's and son's hands, walked to the ice jade bed, and reached out to touch it, feeling the extremely cold energy. A trace of reminiscence appeared in her eyes. \"Yes! On this bed, we have gained so much. Bing Yun, there are some things that even you don't know. Only a few people from our generation truly understand the inside story. Now, this secret needs to be told. Perhaps I won't be in the position of Pagoda Master for too long. In the future, you will be my successor. Oh, right. I haven't thanked you for helping Nian Bing rescue me this time. I never expected that the youngest disciple of our generation would be so adaptable. Thank you, little junior sister.\"\n\nLan Chen's face turned red, and she lowered her head. \"Sister, I... I don't think I can stay in the Ice God Pagoda, and I also cannot be the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess in the future.\"\n\nBing Ling looked at her with some surprise. \"Bing Yun, why? I often hear my sister say that you are even more outstanding than we were back then. It would be most suitable for you to inherit the Ice God Pagoda in the future. Why don't you want to be the Pagoda Master?\"\n\nLan Chen secretly glanced at Nian Bing, who was also looking at her. Hearing her mother's question, she quickly said, \"Mom, I'm afraid Bing Yun can no longer be your junior sister. She should also call you Mom. She... she is already my wife.\"\n\nIt turned out that earlier, when Lan Chen and Xun Lu rescued Bing Ling and Rong Tian, they were in a hurry. They were also concerned about the battle Nian Bing was in, so they didn't have time to explain. Bing Ling naturally recognized her. Hearing that her son had arrived, she hurried out without thinking too much. Hearing Nian Bing's somewhat awkward words at this moment, Bing Ling and Rong Tian exchanged glances.\n\nLan Chen felt a little uneasy, fearing that Bing Ling and Rong Tian would look down on her as their daughter-in-law. She lowered her head and fiddled with her clothes, unsure of what to do. Fortunately, Nian Bing timely held her small hand, giving her some confidence.\n\nRong Tian smiled. \"Good boy, you truly are my son. I didn't expect you to learn this from me too, just like your old dad, you've won the love of an ice beauty. Good, that's wonderful. I often hear your mom say that Bing Yun is the most beautiful and has the best aptitude among the Ice God Pagoda disciples of their generation. Your eyesight is good, son!\"\n\nSeeing his father smile, Nian Bing's heavy heart finally settled. \"Yes! Isn't this all due to your good teaching?\"\n\nBing Ling said grumpily, \"What 'yes'? You're so young and you've already seduced our Yun'er.\"\n\nNian Bing said somewhat wronged, \"Mom, I'm already twenty-one years old. Is it too much for a man my age to have a wife?\"\n\nBing Ling was stunned. In her heart, she had always regarded her son as a child. Yes! Ten years had passed, and her son had grown up. It was time for him to get married. Time passed so quickly. For more than ten years, she hadn't fulfilled her duty as a mother. Although it wasn't what she wanted, looking at Nian Bing's handsome face, Bing Ling's eyes reddened again. She reached out and hugged her son's tall body, choking, \"Child, you've suffered all these years.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes also reddened. Thinking of the years without his parents, he felt a surge of bitterness. Seeing his parents again, his heart became exceptionally full. Just as sadness was about to rise, he heard Rong Tian say, \"Alright, alright. Today is a joyous occasion for our family reunion. Don't cry anymore. We should talk about happy things. Ling'er, don't you want to hear how our son has lived all these years?\"\n\nBing Ling and Nian Bing, interrupted by Rong Tian, felt their sadness lessen somewhat. Nian Bing said softly, \"Mom, is it okay for Bing Yun to be your daughter-in-law? Her real name is Lan Chen. You can call her Chen Chen. Actually, before coming here, she had already left the Ice God Pagoda. Just like you and Dad back then. You must agree to our matter!\"\n\nBing Ling took Lan Chen's hand and Nian Bing's hand, sighing, \"Of course, it's your blessing to be able to marry Chen Chen. How outstanding she is! How could I refuse? Chen Chen, don't worry. Even if you become the Pagoda Master of the Ice God Pagoda, you can still get married. The rules of the Ice God Pagoda must be changed. Otherwise, who knows how many tragedies will occur in the future. I never want what happened to Rong Tian and me to happen again.\"\n\nLan Chen's pretty face had long since turned red. She didn't have as thick skin as Nian Bing, but hearing Bing Ling's approval, she couldn't help but look up, tears shimmering in her eyes. After all, only by gaining the approval of Nian Bing's parents would she truly be considered Nian Bing's wife. Thinking of this, she almost instinctively said softly, \"Thank you, Mom.\"\n\nHearing the word \"Mom,\" Bing Ling felt a warmth fill her heart. \"Good child, quickly tell Mom when you got married.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Mom, we haven't officially married yet, but Chen Chen will definitely be my wife. Actually, those wedding ceremonies are useless. As long as we recognize each other and you recognize us, isn't that enough?\"\n\nBing Ling said grumpily, \"You think very highly of yourself, trying to trick the girl into your hands so quickly! I know Chen Chen's family background, and her parents are also prominent figures. How can we wrong her? After things here are settled, find some time, and your dad and I will personally go to the Oran Empire to propose. It must be done grandly. She is their only daughter, and you are our only son!\" Although she had been with her beloved husband all these years, the long years of loneliness made Bing Ling crave excitement in her heart, let alone that it would be her son's wedding!\n\nNian Bing mumbled softly, \"If you go to propose in person, you'll be tired. You'll have to propose three times.\"\n\nBing Ling had excellent hearing. \"What did you say? Three times?\"\n\nNian Bing stuck out his tongue, but he didn't dare to hide it from his parents. He quickly explained the situation with the three girls. When Bing Ling and Rong Tian heard Nian Bing say that he already had three wives, and that they were all so outstanding, they were stunned. After a while, they finally came to their senses.\n\nRong Tian praised, \"Good, truly my good son, you're capable! You married three at once. It seems our family will have successors.\"",

    "content": "Bing Ling rolled her eyes at him and said, \"What? Are you envious of having two wives? Do you want to try marrying three?\"\n\nRong Tian's expression changed. He said righteously, \"In my entire life, I have only admired Bing Ling. No matter how beautiful any other girl is, she cannot compare to my wife.\" The seriousness on his face was clearly feigned. However, Bing Ling seemed to buy it. Her displeasure vanished, and she smiled gently at him. Rong Tian returned her smile, and everything was understood without words.\n\nSeeing his parents' affection, Nian Bing felt even warmer. \"Mom, this marriage isn't urgent. Can you first tell me what exactly happened with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess today? Why did she look so strange? Isn't she your master? How did she become your senior sister? Did I hear wrong? Though, I think I heard you call her 'senior sister' several times.\"\n\nBing Ling sighed and said, \"You didn't mishear. She is indeed my senior sister. Didn't you ask if the person named Bing Jie existed in the Ice God Tower? She does exist in the tower, and Bing Jie is my senior sister! She told you she was dead, referring to the former Bing Jie. The current Bing Jie has been reborn.\"\n\nNian Bing's whole body trembled. He was stunned and unable to speak, his mouth agape. \"No way, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess is the lover of my master, the Ghost Chef, Cha Ji? This is too absurd.\" However, he recalled the moment during his decisive battle with the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess when she suddenly transformed into a dual Ice and Fire element mage. He started to believe it.\n\nBing Ling continued, \"Yes, she is my senior sister. In fact, the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess you remember is already dead. That was my master! Over ten years ago, after Master brought me back to the Ice God Tower, her mood was affected, and her cultivation advanced too rapidly, causing her to go berserk. At that time, I really regretted it, thinking that Master had become like that because of me.\n\nIn the Ice God Tower, Master had two direct disciples: myself and my senior sister, Bing Jie, who is the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess you met. After Master went berserk, she forcibly suppressed her injuries. She didn't blame me further and even offered to pass on the position of Ice God Tower Master to me. She decided to hold a ceremony to bestow the Tower Master position upon me in front of all the disciples of this tower. But on the day of the disaster relief, you and your father came. Seeing you both, how could I have the heart to become the Ice God Tower Master? I was afraid you would be harmed. Later, I gave you that Ice Snow Goddess Stone. After you left, your father and I were sealed by our disheartened Master. At that time, Master was on the verge of being unable to suppress the backlash from going berserk. The Ice God Tower was the crystallization of her life's work, and she had to find someone to inherit it. And that person was my senior sister.\"\n\nBing Ling paused at this point before continuing, \"It's no wonder that people in the tower didn't know about my senior sister's existence. Although my senior sister joined the sect earlier than me, her talent was slightly inferior to mine. Moreover, her constitution was very peculiar; she had a dual Ice and Fire elemental body, Nian Bing, you are the same in this regard. Master took her as a disciple precisely because of the special nature of her body. Although senior sister cultivated diligently, her comprehension was always a bit lacking, which greatly displeased Master. Therefore, she never intended to pass on the Tower Master position to her. Later, senior sister suddenly disappeared after returning home to visit her relatives. At that time, your father and I hadn't met yet, and I was still in the tower. Senior sister's disappearance lasted for a long time. When she returned to the Ice God Tower, she had changed completely, becoming unusually silent. She would often hide in a corner and cry by herself. Senior sister and I had always had a very good relationship. Although Master was extremely displeased with senior sister's state and punished her with solitary confinement, forbidding her to leave her secluded cultivation place until she reached the Magus realm, I was able to see her frequently due to Master's favor.\n\nIt was for this reason that most disciples in the tower only knew that Master had me as her only direct disciple. Only a few elder sisters knew about Senior Sister Bing Jie's existence. One day, I found an opportunity to sneak into the place where senior sister was in solitary confinement. It was only then that I learned what had happened to senior sister. It turned out that when senior sister returned home to visit her relatives, she discovered that her father was dying. Senior sister had lost her mother in childhood, and her father had raised her. To her, her father was the most important person. His death caused a significant change in her mindset. Her father was originally a chef, and he died of depression after a competition with a very famous chef in the Culinary God Competition. At the time of his death, her father died with his eyes open, always thinking of defeating that chef. For this reason, senior sister vowed to defeat the person who caused her father's death through her culinary skills and ruin his reputation. It was also because of this incident that senior sister disappeared during that period. She apprenticed herself to a friend of her father's and studied culinary arts for a while. Later, I don't know how, she managed to defeat that enemy and even forced that chef to cripple his own tendons and retire from the culinary world. Tragically, during her interactions with that chef, she fell in love with him.\n\nIt was precisely because of this that senior sister's life was destined to be tragic. Although her person had returned, her heart was already broken. She knew very well that the chef she loved always put culinary arts first in his life, and she had ruined his life. How could the two of them be together? Therefore, everything ended. Everything turned into a bubble. Senior sister could only return and silently bear her inner torment in solitary confinement. She was a very pitiful person.\"\n\nNian Bing said with a wry smile, \"The master she apprenticed herself to was probably Zi Xiu, known as the 'Humpback Culinary God', right? Mom, I know who this person your senior sister fell in love with is; it's my master, Cha Ji, known as the 'Ghost Chef' in the culinary world. What happened next?\"\n\nBing Ling looked at Nian Bing in surprise before saying, \"Senior sister remained in confinement, enduring her pain and cultivating magic. Several years later, when I left the Ice God Tower, I met your father, and later, you were born. It wasn't until I had my own lover that I understood senior sister's sadness more deeply. Later, you and your father came to find me. Master was extremely disappointed in me and, in her helplessness, released senior sister, who had already reached the Magus realm. Your father and I were then sealed in the solitary confinement place where senior sister cultivated. Shortly after, senior sister came to see me. She told me that Master had died and passed on the position of Ice Snow Goddess Priestess to her. However, because senior sister had never appeared in the Ice God Tower, she had no authority. Therefore, Master ordered her to change her appearance using magic, to resemble Master and continue the glory of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess.\n\nBefore her death, Master also transferred her magical power to senior sister through a special method, allowing her to instantly become a new Divine Descendant and open two acupoints. Master's dying instruction to senior sister was not to let your father and me out unless I could surpass senior sister in strength one day. Senior sister dared not disobey Master's orders, and at the same time, she feared that the Rong family would hunt us down, so she kept us there. Child, you should understand now that senior sister would absolutely not harm your father and me.\"\n\nLan Chen exclaimed, \"Senior sister, no, Mom, are you saying that the one who has been teaching me magic all this time wasn't Master, but Senior Sister Bing Jie? But I didn't feel any difference between her and Master!\"\n\nBing Ling smiled and said, \"Silly child, you were still young then. Around the time you were less than ten years old, Senior Sister Bing Jie had already taken over Master's position. With her familiarity with Master and her magical strength, how could you possibly have noticed? As you grew up, you became accustomed to senior sister's aura, and naturally, nothing would happen. In fact, you have never truly seen Senior Sister Bing Jie's appearance. Now that she is gone, if I'm not mistaken, she must have gone to seek her lover. I hope she can find him. If that person can forgive senior sister, perhaps senior sister's later half of her life will become happy, which is what I most wish to see. I will bless her.\"\n\nNian Bing said with a bitter smile, \"Mom, that is probably not going to happen. Because my master is already dead.\"\n\nBing Ling trembled violently. She exclaimed, \"What? You're saying that person is already dead?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Years ago, when I left Peach Blossom Forest, Master had already died. Perhaps your senior sister doesn't know that Master had been living in Peach Blossom Forest, not too far from here. Perhaps Master had always hoped to see your senior sister. But this is the Ice God Tower. With Master's strength, apart from his culinary skills, he had no other abilities. How could he possibly come here?\"\n\nBing Ling looked at Nian Bing with a dazed expression. \"Dead, he's actually dead. If senior sister knew, I'm afraid...\"\n\nNian Bing sighed. \"Perhaps this is also the punishment she deserved. Back then, although my master defeated her father, it was in a formal competition. Originally, she shouldn't have harbored any thoughts of revenge, let alone ruined my master's pair of naturally gifted hands. The mistake has already been made. Even if my master were alive, the knot in his heart wouldn't disappear so easily. Everything has passed, and my master is already dead. Mom, please don't worry about it anymore. Let everything unfold naturally. Back then, if it weren't for my master, I would have probably died long ago. You wanted to hear my story, didn't you? Then I will tell you.\"\n\nNian Bing continued his story from morning until night. He tried his best to conceal the situations where he had been in danger, merely recounting his experiences. When Rong Tian learned that Nian Bing had been allowed to rejoin the Rong family by Prince Rong Qin, his eyes welled up with tears. Just as Bing Ling had always considered herself a disciple of the Ice God Tower, he had always considered himself a member of the Rong family.\n\nA full day passed. Nian Bing realized that today seemed to have passed particularly quickly. Although Bing Jie's matter had brought back memories of his deceased master, he still felt happiness upon seeing his parents. In front of his parents, he no longer needed to be so strong. In front of his parents, he could always be a child.\n\nAnother benefit of the Xi Jing acupoint gradually manifested. The self-nourishment of Innate Qi continuously restored Nian Bing's physical functions. His injured arm was slightly better than that of the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess Bing Jie. Under the effect of Innate Qi, although his strength had not fully recovered, his injuries were gradually improving. Moreover, he also had light element magic. Recovering to his optimal state was only a matter of time.\n\nAt this moment, Nian Bing had already begun to recount the affairs of the Divine Continent and Xi Lu. After hearing Nian Bing's description of the Divine Continent, Rong Tian and Bing Ling's expressions became much more solemn. Rong Tian asked, \"Nian Bing, have you discussed this matter with your grandfather?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"I have already discussed it. Grandpa didn't give me any specific advice, only letting me handle it myself. Moreover, what I know about the Divine Continent's movements is still just speculation; I cannot draw a conclusion yet. Dad, what do you think I should do? Should I help the Lost Continent return, or should I prevent its return?\" As he said this, he specifically glanced at Xi Lu. Xi Lu's face showed no expression, while Chen quietly listened beside him.\n\nRong Tian fell into thought. Nian Bing was also thinking. Now that his parents had been rescued, and the matter of the Phoenix Clan had been resolved, the most important issue for him was to face the impending Yin Extreme Day. If he chose to prevent the Lost Continent's return, it would be very easy. With the strength of the experts from the Divine Continent and the Seven Dragon Kings, that lich Xie Yue would have almost no chance. However, he truly did not want to associate with those gods. Although Nian Bing did not know the whereabouts of other gods, he was certain that these gods must have already caused a lot of trouble for the Yang Guang Continent. He really did not want the Divine Continent to continue to exist in this state. Otherwise, once these gods returned to the Divine Continent, the situation on the Yang Guang Continent would inevitably spread there. At that time, who could guarantee that gods would not arrive on this continent in large numbers? What would they bring? What would happen? The only word Nian Bing could think of was disaster.\n\nThe threat of the Divine Continent was immense, but Nian Bing also thought of the unpredictable Lost Continent. A full ten thousand years had passed! Who knew what changes the Lost Continent had undergone? If the people of the Lost Continent had also become like those of the Divine Continent, once they returned, their destruction might not be any less than that of the Divine Continent, and they might even bring greater trouble. What troubled Nian Bing the most was the legend that whoever summoned the Lost Continent back with the Bottle of Mo'udas' Seal would become the master of the Lost Continent. If Xie Yue, that despicable fellow, became the master of the Lost Continent, then the calamity for the Yang Guang Continent would also arrive.",

    "content": "Thinking of these, Nian Bing's heart became even more chaotic.\n\nBing Yun stood behind Nian Bing, her hand always on his shoulder. Her pure innate energy continuously helped Nian Bing recover from his injuries. Although her innate energy was not strong enough, the constant transmission greatly increased Nian Bing's recovery rate.\n\nXi Lu suddenly spoke, \"Nian Bing, you don't need to feel troubled because of me. Do what you want to do. As a person from the Lost Continent, I will only strive for the Lost Continent. Even if we stand on opposing sides, I will never blame you. We will always be good brothers. Fighting for ideals is our dwarf tradition.\"\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile, \"The most difficult thing for me now is that I don't know which decision is the correct one. I also don't know what I should do. However, as things stand, the Divine Continent is definitely difficult to deal with and might bring about a crisis. From historical records, the Lost Continent only wishes to gain freedom. Their reputation is much better than the Divine Continent's. Although most of the information I know comes from the historical records of the Lost Continent, I will never forget what Dragon God said back then. Moreover, as you know, there are still those three terrifying True Gods on the Divine Continent. Even if the continent becomes stronger than before, they may not be able to contend with those three True Gods. I have dealt with the God of Order once. In my perception, that guy is no different from an ordinary god-person. Such a powerful being as him actually ambushed me. I am more inclined to have the Lost Continent return. Perhaps only by stirring the waters first can the Brilliance Continent and peace be guaranteed. At that time, the Divine Continent will definitely focus all its efforts on the Lost Continent. However, if I do this, I will be helping that guy Xie Yue. If that evil existence rules the Lost Continent, it will be a disaster for the continent itself. Moreover, I am unwilling to be an enemy of Brother Xi Lu, and at the same time, I am also unwilling to be an enemy of the Seven Dragon Kings!\"\n\nHearing Nian Bing say this, Rong Tian's eyes suddenly lit up, \"Nian Bing, I have a solution.\"\n\nNian Bing was overjoyed. No matter who it was, one always admired their father, and Nian Bing was no exception. Even though he now had great strength, Rong Tian still held a very high position in his heart. \"What solution, Dad, tell me quickly.\"\n\nRong Tian gave a wry smile, \"Actually, this is also a not-so-good solution. Listening to what you just said, I'll analyze it for you. Your current impression of the Divine Continent is very bad, and you fear they will pose a threat to our Brilliance Continent. But regarding the Lost Continent, you are afraid that the Lich will rule the Lost Continent, not only bringing threats to our Brilliance Continent, but the people of the Lost Continent themselves will also face trouble. Since this is the case, there is now a ready-made solution. You really dislike those evil fellows, and your feeling is correct; they absolutely cannot be allowed to rule the Lost Continent. But the threat from the Divine Continent is more obvious now. Since this is the case, we can imagine that what you worry about most is the legend of the Lost Continent, the legend of the curse of the seven bottles. Then, whether this legend is true or false, we can make preparations to avoid the crisis brought by this legend.\"\n\nNian Bing already understood his father's meaning a little. He hesitated and said, \"Dad, you mean...\"\n\nRong Tian smiled and nodded, \"That's right. Since Xie Yue can summon people to bring back the Lost Continent, why can't you? If the Lost Continent finally submits to you, and you become the new ruler of the Lost Continent, then all problems will be solved, won't they? Whether it's confronting the Divine Continent or preventing the Lost Continent from harming the Brilliance Continent, it will no longer be a problem.\"\n\nHearing Rong Tian's words, Xi Lu's eyes lit up first, \"Yes, Nian Bing, Uncle's suggestion is really great. How did I not think of it? If you can become the new master of the Lost Continent, then what do we have to worry about? That's great, this is truly a wonderful idea!\"\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile, \"I don't want to be the master of any continent. Brother Xi Lu, you are originally from the Lost Continent, and I also feel that Father's suggestion is very appropriate. Then, let you be the master of the Lost Continent.\"\n\nXi Lu was startled and repeatedly waved his hands, \"No, I absolutely cannot. I only know how to fight. When it comes to this aspect, even a hundred of me can't compare to one of you. Moreover, according to our clan's records, although the various races on the Lost Continent are very united, the ruler of the Lost Continent has always been a human. It's not because of racial discrimination, but because humans have always been the most intelligent among all races. Don't push it away. If this is how it's resolved, it will be a win-win situation for everyone. As for the Seven Dragon Kings, we can find another way to deal with them. I think the dragon race doesn't have a good impression of the Divine Continent itself, so they might not stand on the side of those god-people.\"\n\nNian Bing did not refuse Xi Lu's suggestion. He knew that it was not the time for politeness. After thinking for a moment, he said, \"Father's method is good, but there are still many problems before us. Firstly, we don't know how to summon the Seal Bottle of Meodas. If we want to seize control of the Lost Continent at the last moment, we have to deal with the devil. Xie Yue is not easy to deal with, and with his cunning, we may not succeed. Secondly, once the Lost Continent truly appears, it is equivalent to actively provoking the Divine Continent. The Divine Continent, which was originally self-sealed, will definitely unseal itself at the first opportunity and launch an attack on the Lost Continent. At that time, war will be inevitable. Although I am not from the Lost Continent, I do not wish to see the Lost Continent devastated!\"\n\nRong Tian said, \"Son, I understand your thoughts. But don't you think you are a bit of a coward? What is bound to happen will happen. Even if the Lost Continent does not appear, with the situation on the Divine Continent, one day, they will leave that hell-like land and step onto our homeland. Since that's the case, why don't we change from being passive to active? Only in this way can we hold the initiative in our own hands. As for the problems you mentioned earlier, we can plan carefully and do our best to achieve them.\"\n\nListening to his father's words, Nian Bing nodded firmly. He realized how good it felt to have his father by his side. He didn't need to have any doubts about what his father said. Back then, Nian Bing had to be very careful with Prince Rong, but with his own father, what else could he not trust? \"Alright, if that's the case, let's leave it like this for now. There are about three more months until the Day of Ultimate Yin. During this time, I need to make arrangements. Although the strength of ordinary humans is far inferior to god-people, this is our territory after all. There are still many things that can be utilized.\"\n\nBing Ling smiled and said, \"Son, your father and I never imagined that your experiences over the past ten years would be so rich. You have spent too little time with us, and we have never fulfilled our responsibilities as parents. No matter what decision you make, your father and mother will stand by your side. For the past ten years, although your father and I were sealed, we never stopped practicing magic. Although my master died back then, and she was very disappointed in me, before she died, she had her senior sister give us her magic experience accumulated over the years. Now, I have reached the strength of an Ice Element Divine Descender Master. Your father's improvement is slower due to the environment here, but he is already a Fire Element Archmage. When you need it, your father and mother will be your assistants.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes were a little moist. Looking at the kind smile in his mother's eyes, he secretly told himself that no matter the outcome of this matter, his parents must not be involved. This was because he did not want to see his parents, who had finally escaped from suffering, be harmed again. Although he thought this way, Nian Bing did not show it on his face. He just nodded slightly.\n\nLan Chen smiled and said, \"Nian Bing, we've been talking all day, and everyone is tired. You still need to heal. I'll go get some food, and then everyone should rest early.\"\n\nAs soon as he heard the word \"eat,\" Nian Bing quickly said, \"Then I'll do it. Do you and Mom know? When I was learning culinary arts with my master, I always thought about how wonderful it would be if I could cook a meal for you myself! But I always thought you were dead back then, and every time I thought of this, my heart felt very distressed. Today, I must let you taste my cooking with your own mouths.\"\n\nBing Ling said with some concern, \"Silly child, what we eat is not important. As long as you are safe and sound, that is our greatest happiness. Listen to me, you are not allowed to work hard anymore today. Do you think my senior sister's strength is a joke? Although I have worked hard all these years, I know that compared to my senior sister who inherited my master's abilities, I am still quite far behind. You had a big fight with her and have not rested at all, so your body will not be able to take it. Alright, listen to me, you rest well today. There will be plenty of opportunities to cook for us in the future.\"\n\nAlthough Nian Bing was a little disappointed, he would not refuse his mother's words. He could only look at Rong Tian for help. Rong Tian jokingly said, \"Don't look at me. Don't you know that your mother is now the respected Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess? Our family has the final say.\"\n\nBing Ling's pretty face turned red, \"You're so annoying, you just like to tease me. Alright, Chen Chen, ask the disciples of the Ice God Tower to bring some food up. Alas, starting tomorrow, it seems I will also be busy.\" Newly taking over the position of Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess was not a simple matter of succession; she still had many things to do. Among the mages in the conflict zones, there were not a few powerful ones. Making them sincerely submit was not an easy task.\n\nLan Chen left the room. Bing Ling pulled Nian Bing to the side and enveloped herself and her son with magic, ensuring their voices would not be heard. She whispered, \"Nian Bing, are you and Chen Chen really married?\"\n\nNian Bing scratched his head, \"Mom, we can't really say we're married, but we are together.\"\n\nBing Ling suddenly realized, \"So that's how it is. I wish Chen Chen was still a virgin. Nian Bing, your father and I weren't by your side since you were young. If you don't understand anything about matters between men and women, you can ask your father.\" Saying this, her face couldn't help but turn red.\n\nNian Bing was speechless, \"Mom, are you sure you're not mistaken? I, I actually... Chen Chen and I have already... how could she still be a virgin?\"\n\nBing Ling chuckled, \"How could I be mistaken? How could I be wrong about this? The Ice God Tower has its own special methods for identifying virginity. Look at Chen Chen, there's a moist film on her eyes... why am I telling you this? Anyway, what I mean is, she is still a virgin.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at his mother blankly. His mother didn't seem to be joking, but he and Chen Chen had already had relations. What was going on? Suddenly, a flash of inspiration struck him, and he understood immediately. The reason his mother said Bing Ling was still a virgin was probably related to the changes in Phoenix Volcano. Could it be that because of the phoenix's rebirth, her body had also returned to its perfect virgin state? Thinking of this, Nian Bing's heart couldn't help but feel a surge of heat.\n\nNian Bing stayed at the Ice God Tower for a full half month before reluctantly leaving. Bing Ling had become the new Priestess of the Ice and Snow Goddess, and she and Rong Tian naturally didn't have to go to the Phoenix Clan. This also fulfilled one of Nian Bing's ideas; he hadn't planned to return to the Phoenix Clan in the short term anyway. When Nian Bing left the Ice God Tower, he left Lan Chen behind. Besides needing Lan Chen to help his mother with the affairs of the Ice God Tower, he also had a bit of his own selfish motive. Of course, he would definitely not let Lan Chen know these things. These days, he had wanted to try with Lan Chen to see if she was still a virgin, but he never got the chance. Because of the succession of the Ice and Snow Goddess, the Ice God Tower fell into temporary chaos. Lan Chen was busy modifying the rules of the Ice God Tower with Bing Ling every day. When she was resting at night, seeing how tired she looked, how could Nian Bing bear to ask for anything more?\n\nThe cold wind blew, and the characteristic cold currents of the Ice Moon Empire had swept across the entire north. Traces of ice and snow could be seen in every corner of the empire. After breakfast, Nian Bing and Xi Lu left the Ice God Tower.\n\nWalking on the main road, Xi Lu said, \"Nian Bing, I really envy you!\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Brother, do you know why I used the Longevity Blade to change your appearance and why it went so smoothly? Actually, I can feel that your mother's soul is within the Longevity Blade. Actually, she has never left you.\"",

    "content": "Xi Lu stopped, his voice trembling, \"Are you, are you telling the truth?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"Yes, don't you find the aura of the Longevity Blade very familiar?\"\n\nXi Lu's eyes welled up a little. He lowered his head and looked at his own tall frame, lost in thought.\n\nNian Bing put an arm around his shoulder, \"Brother, thank you.\"\n\n\"Thank me? Thank you for what?\" Xi Lu looked at Nian Bing in surprise.\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Thank you for always being by my side and supporting me! No matter what I do, you're always there. You know? It feels so good to have you. With us brothers together, we're unstoppable.\"\n\nXi Lu smiled, \"However, you really are quite heartless. To just leave like that. Kong Dong, spend more time with Uncle and parents.\"\n\nNian Bing forced a smile, \"I don't want to leave either! But the situation is tense now, and I have no choice but to go. Since I've decided to help the Lost Continent return, I have to deal with many things in advance. Once this matter is successfully completed, I won't have any important matters left to attend to. Then, I can properly spend time with my parents.\"\n\nXi Lu sighed softly, \"Nian Bing, perhaps they didn't expect it, but I'm by your side every day, and I know your thoughts to some extent. When you were at the Phoenix Clan, you left immediately after cultivating, and you left the Phoenix Girl and Dragon Spirit behind. And this time, when you went to the Ice God Tower, you also left Lan Chen behind, saying you had business in Ice Moon City. Actually, you don't want them to accompany you on adventures. I think if it weren't for my connection with the Lost Continent, you might have tried to find a way to keep even me in one place.\"\n\nNian Bing forced a smile, \"How could that be? Brother, I will definitely take you with me.\"\n\nXi Lu laughed jokingly, \"Alright, brother. I know you're doing this for our own good. But you can't disregard your own safety either! If something happens to you, the world might fall into chaos.\"\n\nLooking at Xi Lu's smile, Nian Bing couldn't help but smile wryly, \"Brother, you didn't tell them about this, did you? I thought I was acting very naturally and didn't reveal any flaws. How could you have guessed?\"\n\nXi Lu smiled slightly, \"Yes, I don't think they've guessed your intentions yet. I could guess because I care too much about the matters of the Lost Continent. Every time you mentioned the situation of the Lost Continent, I paid special attention. So, I discovered a problem. When you mentioned the upcoming unsealing of the curse of the Bottle of Moordas, you only said it was in a place of extreme Yin, but you never revealed the exact location. It was from this point that I judged you didn't want them to accompany you on adventures. Am I right?\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment, \"Brother, you're really observant. Indeed, I don't want them to accompany me on adventures. You know, when that day comes, how many powerful experts will gather in that place of extreme Yin? Especially since we've decided to help the Lost Continent return, it's equivalent to deciding to oppose the Seven Dragon Kings and all the divine beings. Danger is inevitable, so...\"\n\nXi Lu raised his hand to stop Nian Bing from saying more, \"I understand what you mean, you don't need to explain. Just remember not to leave me behind when the time comes. I can understand your feelings. If it were me, I might do the same.\"\n\nNian Bing breathed a sigh of relief, \"Thank you, Brother. Let's hurry. My trip to Ice Moon City is not a pretense. I really have business to do there. Since we've decided to help the Lost Continent return, we must consider the possible changes once the Lost Continent returns. You know, the Lost Continent borders our continent and the Divine Continent. Therefore, important locations must be heavily guarded to prevent any unforeseen events.\"\n\nXi Lu suddenly realized, \"So that's how it is. You've thought of everything. It seems your identity as the leader of the Blood Lion Cult will come in handy again.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"Not just the identity of the Blood Lion Cult leader. The previous location of the Lost Continent was connected to our Radiant Continent in the Tian Dang Mountain Range. At that time, it was the location of the Orlan Empire, and it was also very close to the Ice Moon Empire. So, what we need to do now is to station a strong force there, and it must be all experts. This requires the cooperation of the two major empires' officials. I think there will be no problem with the Ice Moon Empire, and with Luo Rou as the prime minister in the Orlan Empire, with her intelligence, she should also succeed. Once the worries are gone, we can proceed with peace of mind.\"\n\nXi Lu said, \"Yes, proceed with peace of mind. However, have you thought about how we should do it? Before leaving the Ice God Tower, you said you would discuss it with Uncle and parents after returning from the Ice Moon Empire. But looking at you now, I don't think you plan to go back.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Brother, you say you're not smart? That's right, I don't plan to go back. However, I haven't figured out the strategy yet. Yue Xie's side is still weaker, but Yue Xie is a lich, and his strength should not be underestimated. Last time, in the battle with the Seven Dragon Kings, he never used his full strength. I have no idea what his true strength is. Moreover, he has several subordinates with very strong abilities. It's already very difficult for the two of us to deal with them all. As for the Seven Dragon Kings and the divine beings, there's no point in even thinking about resisting them. There's no chance. Now there are still more than two months left, and I need to think carefully to find the best solution.\"\n\nXi Lu smiled, \"Okay, no matter what method you find, I will support you. I really want to see what the place where our ancestors lived looks like. I wonder how our clansmen on the Lost Continent are doing.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"We will definitely succeed.\"\n\nXi Lu smiled slightly, \"I also deeply believe that.\"\n\nThe two of them didn't advance quickly. They left the Ice God Tower in the morning and arrived at the Ice Moon Empire at noon. As soon as they entered the city, Xi Lu told Nian Bing that he was hungry. Looking at Xi Lu's eager eyes, Nian Bing knew he wanted to eat something he made again. Thinking of food, Nian Bing felt a little lost. During the half-month stay at the Ice God Tower, he had been cooking for his parents. He was surprised to find that his culinary skills had not only not declined but had become more precise with the increase of his own energy, making his dishes taste even better. If it weren't for the important matters at hand, he really wanted to have a competition with Xiao Tian, the winner of the competition, to see whose culinary skills were more advanced.\n\n\"Brother, what do you want to eat?\"\n\n\"Anything you make will do. I really indulged myself at the Ice God Tower this time. Nian Bing, your cooking is getting better and better. Do you know that even though it's only been half a month, Uncle and Aunt's complexion has clearly improved, and their appetite has increased significantly? I wonder if they will be able to get used to ordinary food after you leave.\"\n\nNian Bing forced a smile, \"There's nothing we can do about it. Brother, let's go. We'll find a restaurant, and I'll figure out a way to cook for you.\"\n\nSince Yan Feng ascended the throne, the Ice Moon City has become more prosperous with the stability of politics. As the capital of the entire Ice Moon Empire, this is naturally even more evident. The shops along the roads are very lively. From a distance, Nian Bing could see a fairly large restaurant. He nodded to Xi Lu, and the two of them walked towards the restaurant.\n\nAs soon as they reached the entrance, a waiter greeted them, \"Gentlemen, would you like to dine? We have not only various local delicacies but also food from other empires. And the prices are very reasonable.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Okay. We'll eat here.\" The two were led by the waiter into the restaurant's main hall. They were very casual people and found a table by the window to sit down. This restaurant was of medium size. It was lunchtime, and although it wasn't full, there were still seven or eight out of ten customers, and the business looked quite good.\n\nThe waiter first poured hot tea for Nian Bing and Xi Lu to warm them up, then came over with the menu.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"Okay, we don't need a menu. Let's negotiate with your boss. We'd like to borrow the kitchen to cook something.\"\n\nThe waiter was clearly encountering such a request for the first time. However, the service staff here were quite well-trained. After a slight pause, he replied, \"I'm sorry, sir, but our kitchen is not open to the public. If you really want to cook yourself, I will need to ask our boss for permission.\" He looked at Nian Bing with much more caution. In the culinary world, there are occasional instances of people coming to challenge others, but this mostly happens in some famous high-class restaurants. As for them, they could only be considered medium-class. Although their dishes had some specialties, they were still a far cry from high-class restaurants. Such challenges had never happened before.\n\nNian Bing waved his hand to let the waiter go. After a while, a middle-aged man in splendid attire walked over. He was of medium build, with an ordinary appearance, and had a face full of smiles, clearly a smooth-talker. Although his clothes were luxurious, they were dark in color and not very conspicuous.\n\n\"Gentlemen, our waiter mentioned that you have some special requests.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"Yes, we'd like to borrow your kitchen to cook something for ourselves. We've gotten used to eating our own cooking, and outside food always tastes a bit off. This will be the payment.\" As he spoke, he flicked a purple crystal coin, which landed in the middle-aged man's hand.\n\nThe middle-aged man was stunned for a moment. Looking at the purple crystal coin in his hand, his smile became even more amiable. However, he calmly placed the purple crystal coin on the table and pushed it back towards Nian Bing, \"I'm sorry, sir, but our kitchen really cannot be opened to outsiders. Please forgive us. Actually, our dishes taste quite good. How about you try them?\"\n\nNian Bing was somewhat surprised. A single purple crystal coin was enough for two people to have a grand meal in the most luxurious restaurant, yet the man was unmoved, which truly surprised him. \"Why? Is it because I didn't offer enough money?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man shook his head, \"No, you offered enough money. I can also guess that your culinary skills must be very high, but for the dignity of our restaurant, I cannot allow you to cook here.\"\n\nNian Bing suddenly understood. He realized that the other party had mistaken them for challengers. But it was understandable, as not many restaurants would allow outsiders to cook. He smiled slightly, \"If that's the case, then forget it. Brother Xi Lu, let's go to another place to eat.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Nian Bing stood up, and Xi Lu followed him. Since they wouldn't let him cook here, Nian Bing thought he would have to go back to the Ice Moon Hall of the Blood Lion Cult. The kitchen there would surely not refuse him. Just as the two were about to leave, they heard the middle-aged man suddenly say, \"Wait a moment, please stay, gentlemen.\"\n\nNian Bing turned back, \"What? Is there something else?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man said, \"Looking at you two, you should be chefs, right? Only chefs would find other people's cooking unpalatable. Our restaurant is currently looking for two chefs. If you are willing, the remuneration can be discussed.\"\n\nNian Bing and Xi Lu exchanged glances, and both of them couldn't help but laugh. Not to mention Xi Lu, but with Nian Bing's status, how could he possibly work as a chef in a restaurant now? Even if he were to work, it would have to be in a top-tier restaurant like Qing Feng Zhai.\n\nSeeing their smiles, the middle-aged man felt a bit awkward. He quickly said, \"Although our restaurant is small, business has always been good, and we always treat our chefs well. You might as well state your terms.\" In his opinion, chefs who dared to come and challenge must have good culinary skills. But how could he have known that Nian Bing and Xi Lu were only here for their own food?\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Thank you for your appreciation, but I don't think it's necessary. Brother Xi Lu, let's go.\" The two turned to leave. Just as they reached the entrance, a warrior in samurai attire suddenly came forward. Nian Bing and Xi Lu didn't pay much attention at first, but as the warrior approached them, he showed no intention of avoiding them, causing the two to stop simultaneously.\n\nAs the two stopped, the warrior also stopped. After glancing at Nian Bing, he quickly lowered his head and said, \"Are you two going to the Warrior Guild?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred, \"That's right, we want to learn some lion dance techniques, especially the bright yellow lion, I'm very interested.\"\n\nThe warrior's face showed respect, and he quickly said, \"Then follow me.\" Saying that, he turned and walked away. Nian Bing secretly praised the Blood Lion Cult. As expected of the strongest underground force on the continent, as soon as he arrived in Ice Moon City, he was discovered by the organization's informants. The words he had just spoken were a code within the Blood Lion Cult. The warrior would naturally understand.",

    "content": "The three walked quickly. In no time, they arrived at the Warrior's Guild. Under the guidance of a warrior, they passed through the chaotic hall and arrived at the back chambers of the guild. At this point, the warrior respectfully said, \"This subordinate greets the Pope. Please wait in the meeting room, Pope. I will go invite the Hall Master over now.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and nodded, \"You go ahead. Oh, right, have the kitchen prepare some ingredients. I'll be heading over later.\" The warrior agreed and turned to leave. Nian Bing, with Shi Lu, entered the meeting room and sat on the comfortable sofa. Although they didn't feel tired from walking to Ice Moon City, sitting on this exceptionally accommodating sofa made their whole bodies feel comfortable. As soon as they sat down, someone immediately brought them tea and refreshments. The meeting room was still the same as before. While it couldn't be called luxurious, it was very clean and tidy, leaving a good impression.\n\nIn a short while, Yin Dang's voice could be heard from outside, \"Pope, Yin Dang requests an audience.\" His voice had a strong penetrating quality, drifting directly into the room.\n\n\"Come in,\" Nian Bing said with a faint smile.\n\nThe door opened, and Yin Dang, dressed in a blue robe, walked in. His clothes were very thin, showing no sign of him being in the cold environment of the Ice Moon Empire. He truly was a master of the Martial Saint level. Upon seeing Nian Bing, Yin Dang's eyes clearly showed excitement. He smiled and said, \"Pope, it's been some days since I last saw you. You are truly like a divine dragon, seldom seen!\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Come, Hall Master, please sit. I've appeared now, haven't I?\"\n\nYin Dang knew Nian Bing wasn't one for airs. He directly walked to sit opposite him and asked, \"Pope, what are your commands?\"\n\nNian Bing pondered, \"There are a few things to do. I have a secret letter here. You must deliver it to our Hall Master in the Oulan Empire using the fastest method. Please ask him to execute it according to the letter.\" As he spoke, his hand flashed with silver light, and a letter appeared out of thin air in his grasp. Now was the time to act. With Luo Rou in the Oulan Empire, it was the best opportunity for infiltration. This letter not only contained Nian Bing's instructions for the Oulan Hall but also the necklace Luo Rou had given him back then, though he had kept the red gem for himself.\n\nYin Dang took the letter and respectfully said, \"This subordinate will handle it as quickly as possible and ensure the mission is completed.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"This letter is extremely important. It must not fall into the hands of outsiders, or it will have a significant impact on our church. The person delivering this letter must be reliable, understand?\"\n\nYin Dang nodded. \"Pope, rest assured. Our church has special methods for sending messages. It will not be mishandled.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"That's good. This is the first matter. You should handle it as soon as possible. What is the situation in the Ice Moon Empire now? Have there been any changes?\"\n\nYin Dang shook his head. \"No, the situation in the Ice Moon Empire is very good now. Everything is under our control, and the pace of development is much faster than before. With me and Elder Xue Po here, you can rest assured, Pope. Do you have any instructions for our Ice Moon Hall during your visit this time? I think of your visit every day.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Thinking of me coming? You're probably hoping I'll bring some benefits, aren't you?\" After the \"Change of Sky\" operation was completed, the Ice Moon Hall, which was previously in the middle to lower ranks of the Blood Lion Cult, leaped to become the first major hall. The status of each hall depended on their strength. The Ice Moon Hall controlled almost the entire Ice Moon Empire, naturally becoming the most powerful force within the Blood Lion Cult. Yin Dang also benefited greatly from the \"Change of Sky\" operation. When Nian Bing was in the Hua Rong Empire, he had discussed with the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion. It was decided that Yin Dang, like Xue Po, would become an external elder of the Blood Lion Cult. When they were older, they would retire to the Blood Lion Hall. Although external elders did not have the almost absolute power of the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion over all matters of the Blood Lion Cult, their authority was already very significant.\n\nYin Dang rubbed his hands and chuckled, \"This subordinate would not dare. However, if you have any matters that require this hall to handle, Pope, please do not hesitate to command. My subordinates are all elites among elites, and I guarantee they will handle it properly.\" Regarding this young Pope, Yin Dang, who had interacted with him frequently, as well as the other Hall Masters who had never met Nian Bing, no longer held any contempt. Just that one \"Change of Sky\" operation brought benefits to the Blood Lion Cult unseen for a century. This great merit had completely stabilized Nian Bing's position within the Blood Lion Cult, with no further issues.\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment and said, \"There are indeed some matters that will trouble you. How about this: the Ice Moon Hall has now entered the right track and has no major issues for the time being. Select a group of elites from your hall. The number doesn't need to be large, a hundred people are sufficient, but they must be the strongest experts in the Ice Moon Hall. The most important point is that they must unconditionally execute the orders I issue, without asking any questions. You will lead this team of one hundred people. As for the benefits you want, it will depend on whether your team of a hundred people has the ability to obtain them. At the same time, convey my Pope's order, commanding the five hundred Blood Guards of the Blood Lion Hall to arrive at Ice Moon City as quickly as possible to rendezvous with your team of one hundred people. It would be best if they arrived within half a month. If the elders have any doubts, tell them I have important matters to attend to.\" The Blood Guards were the strongest killing force of the Blood Lion Cult, directly obeying the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion. Only when the Seven Elders signed an order simultaneously could this strongest assassination force of the Blood Lion Cult be mobilized. Even if the Pope wanted to mobilize them, he would have to obtain the consent of the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion. However, with all that Nian Bing had done for the Blood Lion Cult now, the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion would naturally not refuse his request to mobilize these personnel. In the \"Change of Sky\" operation last time, the strength of the Blood Guards left a deep impression on Nian Bing. Five hundred people, after finally breaking into the imperial palace, suffered no losses, and very few were even injured. This was not because each of them was individually strong. There was extremely clever coordination among these five hundred Blood Guards, and each of them was a death-seeking warrior who would kill without blinking. Coupled with their application of poisons, they possessed extremely powerful offensive capabilities. Before the \"Change of Sky\" operation last time, the Blood Guards rarely attacked in groups of more than fifty people. Their greatest achievement was to assassinate hundreds of experts from an underground force with the coordination of thirty people, suffering no losses themselves.\n\nUpon hearing Nian Bing's words, Yin Dang immediately became excited. \"What? Pope, are we going on another major operation? Rest assured, I can select a hundred elite experts within three days. This time, no matter what the operation is, you must take me with you! Rest assured, if any of my subordinates dare to disobey orders, I'll be the first to take their lives.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"The experts you select must not only be strong but also absolutely reliable. Hall Master Yin, I must tell you in advance that this operation is not like the previous 'Change of Sky' operation. This operation is more dangerous than that one. However, the benefits we gain will be difficult to see on the surface.\"\n\nYin Dang was stunned for a moment, but then resolutely said, \"Pope, as long as it is your command, our Ice Moon Hall guarantees to execute it without any doubt.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded with satisfaction. \"That's good. Although this operation is dangerous, for the hundred-person team you select, there will be some benefits. Of course, the prerequisite is that they must successfully complete the mission and return alive.\" As the \"Utmost Yin Day\" was approaching, without the help of Feng Nu and others, Nian Bing could only think of his own Blood Lion Cult experts. However, to avoid affecting the future of the Blood Lion Cult, he did not want too many people involved in this potential crisis.\n\nYin Dang said, \"Pope, will you be staying here with us during this time? Oh, right, there's something else I need to report to you.\"\n\nNian Bing was taken aback. Just as he was about to ask, the Tianyan acupoint between his eyebrows suddenly twitched slightly. A familiar and powerful mental fluctuation caused him to be inwardly startled. Since returning to the Yangguang Continent, this was the strongest mental fluctuation he had felt. Even masters like the divine being Xilun and the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess Bing Jie did not possess such strong mental fluctuations as the newcomer.\n\nThe door opened, and a figure rushed in, \"Nian Bing brother!\" a choked voice sounded. The slender figure suddenly threw herself into Nian Bing's arms and burst into tears.\n\nNian Bing had excellent eyesight. Although the person who rushed in moved quickly, he still saw who it was. Among the people he knew, only she would address him this way. This was Maomao.\n\nMaomao's cries were filled with sorrow. Clinging tightly to Nian Bing's chest, she seemed to have grown a bit taller in the days they hadn't seen each other. Her cries brought a sense of unease to Nian Bing. He looked up at Yin Dang, showing a questioning look. Yin Dang nodded at him, signaling that what he was about to say was about Maomao. Nian Bing waved his hand at Yin Dang. Yin Dang understood and retreated, closing the door properly.\n\nNian Bing stroked Maomao's soft long hair, gently patting her back and channeling streams of gentle light elemental energy into her body to calm her extremely agitated emotions. \"Maomao, be good, quickly tell brother what happened. Why are you at the Ice Moon Hall? Did someone bully you?\"\n\nMaomao's cries were still filled with sorrow. Under Nian Bing's comfort, her body, which had been trembling with excitement, gradually calmed down.\n\nNian Bing's uneasy feeling intensified. Although he hadn't had time to observe closely, Maomao's presence gave him a completely different feeling than before. Nian Bing had known Maomao for a long time. In his impression, Maomao had always been a happy little girl. Although she was only three years younger than Lan Chen and Long Ling, Nian Bing had always treated her as a younger sister. Since he met her, this was the first time he felt such deep sorrow from this cute white girl. He vaguely guessed that something major must have happened. What surprised Nian Bing the most was the mental fluctuation emanating from Maomao. While her mental fluctuations were unstable due to her emotional agitation, they were extraordinarily powerful, so powerful that even Nian Bing was secretly astonished.\n\nAfter a long time, Maomao's cries finally subsided. Under Nian Bing's persuasion, she sat down. Her eyes had become red, her pretty face was noticeably thinner than before, her complexion was pale, and her eyes were vacant. She was still sobbing, but in contrast, a powerful aura emanated from her. The invisible mental fluctuations spread into every corner of the room. Maomao seemed to have grown a bit compared to before. The childlike innocence had disappeared from her face, replaced by endless sorrow in her beautiful eyes.\n\nNian Bing took Maomao's small hand and said, \"Maomao, what happened? Why are you crying so sadly?\"\n\nMaomao's eyes turned red, and she almost burst into tears again. She choked and said, \"Nian Bing brother, now that I've seen you, you must seek justice for Maomao! Maomao, Maomao only has you as family now.\"\n\nNian Bing was greatly shocked and immediately guessed some of it. He said in a deep voice, \"Maomao, calm down first. Did Uncle Xilade have an accident?\"\n\nMaomao nodded, and tears flowed down again. She clenched her hands tightly. For the first time, Nian Bing saw intense hatred in her eyes.\n\n\"Father is dead, Mother is dead, all my tribesmen are dead. Only I am left. Maomao is all alone. Nian Bing brother, Maomao is so pitiful! You must seek justice for Maomao!\"\n\nAlthough he had guessed some of it, when Maomao spoke of the annihilation of her entire tribe, Nian Bing couldn't help but reveal a look of horror in his eyes. Although the white people were not the strongest tribe, they had always kept their distance from human society, similar to the Phoenix tribe, living self-sufficiently. Furthermore, although the white people could not cultivate battle qi or magic, their innate powerful mental strength was their best defense. Although not many could become Summoning Mages, the impression Xilade left on Nian Bing was extremely deep. His summoned pets were a nightmare for ordinary mages. As a summoner who had reached the Archmage realm, who could kill Xilade and completely destroy the white tribe? Nian Bing secretly pondered. There were very few groups on the continent with such strength. Even for himself now, the possibility of completely defeating Xilade was not too great.\n\n\"Maomao, tell me, what exactly happened? Didn't your father summon the Wind Dragon King, Calodiris?\" With the Dragon King by his side, even a level thirteen expert might not be able to harm Xilade.\n\nMaomao said, \"Uncle Calo wasn't here. He hasn't returned. However, Father said that even if Uncle Calo were here, we would be unlikely to escape disaster. It was so scary, so scary. There was blood everywhere, so much blood.\" As she spoke, intense fear unconsciously appeared in her eyes, and her body trembled again. She threw herself into Nian Bing's arms.\n\nNian Bing hugged Maomao's soft body and said, \"Maomao, don't be afraid. With Nian Bing brother here, no one will hurt you. Calm down a bit and tell brother what happened, so brother can help you get revenge.\"",

    "content": "In Nian Bing's warm embrace, Mao Mao indeed calmed down considerably. She nodded and said, \"That day, the weather was very good, the sun was very warm. After Brother had me sent back last time, Father didn't say anything to me, just told me to keep practicing magic. Mao Mao dislikes being lonely the most, so while they weren't paying attention, I sneaked out. I just wanted to go play nearby and then go home. Last time I snuck out, Mother was very sad, and although Mao Mao wanted to come out and find Brother, I was afraid Mother would be sad again, so I didn't dare to go far. But when I went back, everything had changed. Everything had turned red. Our valley, where we white people live, was filled with fire and blood. Uncle was dead, Sister Xiling was dead, they were all dead, all dead.\" At this point, Mao Mao was sobbing uncontrollably. Nian Bing gently patted her back, waiting for her to continue.\n\n\"When Mao Mao didn't know what to do, completely stunned, I suddenly saw several people. There were six of them in total, and they were all dressed very strangely. They were devils. Mao Mao is certain, they must be devils. They were chasing our remaining tribespeople. Father tried his best, summoning all his pets, but he could only watch them die one by one. Father was protecting Mother, but those people were too powerful. Even when Father and Mother joined forces, they couldn't defeat them. They only sent out two people, and Father and Mother were both heavily injured. Mao Mao was so scared, I was really scared then, but I was even more afraid of Father and Mother getting hurt, so I ran over and summoned my little pets to join the fight. At that time, Father looked so scary. He told me to run quickly, but Mao Mao didn't know how to run anymore. I remember the six people very clearly. Their speed was like flying. Our tribespeople were all killed in no time. Many sisters and aunts were also forcibly held down on the ground, and they were doing some strange things. Father kept asking them who they were and why they were attacking us white people. Those people looked hateful and terrifying. They said they were gods and that we white people had violated the gods' will, so we had to die.\"\n\n\"Bastards.\" Xi Lu let out an angry roar and slammed his palm onto a nearby coffee table, turning it into dust. Although Mao Mao's explanation wasn't very clear, both he and Nian Bing understood that the ones who destroyed the entire white tribe were the Divine People from the Divine Continent. Intense hatred surged within Nian Bing. He hadn't been entirely firm about helping the Lost Continent return, but the actions of the Divine People and Mao Mao's sorrow ignited a flame in his heart. At this moment, he no longer had any hesitation. The Divine People, these despicable Divine People, didn't even spare the white people.\n\nMao Mao wiped the tears from her face and said, \"Father became very scary then. Seeing that all the tribespeople were dead, Father and Mother's eyes turned red. They used a special method to greatly enhance their mental power. They directly attacked with their mental power, causing those bad guys to be momentarily stunned. Then Father and Mother, carrying me, escaped on Little Stutter.\"\n\nNian Bing was startled, \"Little Stutter?\"\n\nMao Mao said, \"It's that Golden-Backed Earth Dragon King we were together with last time! Father deliberately trained it, causing it to evolve very quickly. It can already say some simple words, but it stutters, so I call it Little Stutter. If Little Stutter hadn't blocked some attacks, Father and Mother would probably have died too.\"\n\nNian Bing said sadly, \"What happened after that? Since you escaped, where are Uncle Xilard and your mother?\" As he asked, he stroked Mao Mao's hair, giving her a sense of security in his arms. This allowed Mao Mao, despite her agitation, to recount her tragic experience.\n\nMao Mao sniffled and said, \"Although we escaped, Father said those people would catch up soon. Little Stutter's speed couldn't shake them off, even flying was difficult. At that time, Father and Mother were already quite injured. Father originally wanted to let me and Mother go first, but Mother refused no matter what. They argued for a while, and in just a moment, those figures could be seen behind us. Although Little Stutter could fly, it could only fly low, and it wasn't faster when flying than when running on the ground. Seeing that those people were about to catch up, just when Mao Mao thought she would die like her tribespeople, Father summoned his last summon, and Mother did too. Among our white tribe, any summoner has their own life-bound sacred beast. Although it's the most powerful pet, it's also closely related to the summoner. If something happens to the life-bound sacred beast, the summoner will also die.\"\n\nNian Bing was a little surprised, \"Life-bound summon beast? Isn't Uncle Xilard's life-bound sacred beast the Wind Dragon King Carolodilis?\"\n\nMao Mao shook her head and said, \"No, it's not. Although Uncle Carol is the strongest summon beast, he doesn't belong to my father. My father and mother's life-bound sacred beasts are a pair of Seven-Colored Phoenix Tigers. Phoenix Tigers are incredibly powerful, and the Seven-Colored ones are kings among Phoenix Tigers, very formidable. Moreover, as Father and Mother's life-bound sacred beasts, they possess stronger abilities than ordinary Phoenix Tigers. Whatever mental magic Father and Mother can use, these Seven-Colored Phoenix Tigers can also use, even unleashing their strongest power. This life-bound sacred beast is something every summoner in our white tribe cultivates from the moment they are confirmed to become summoners. They are symbiotic with the summoner. Life-bound sacred beasts cannot be used lightly. Each time they are used, the summoner's own lifespan is reduced based on the energy consumed by the life-bound sacred beast. Therefore, the summoning of life-bound sacred beasts is also called the final summon of our white tribe. Father and Mother had already summoned their life-bound sacred beasts once before in the tribe, cooperating with our tribespeople to attack those guys. However, those guys were really too powerful; even their life-bound sacred beasts were useless against them. But this time it was different. Father and Mother, almost simultaneously, merged their blood with their life-bound sacred beasts, unleashing their strongest power in an instant to attack those six bad guys. With the merging of blood, the life-bound sacred beasts can unleash more than three times their usual power and become extremely ferocious. However, with the merging of blood, the ultimate result is the death of both human and beast, because the merging process has exhausted the full potential of both the life-bound sacred beast and the summoner. This method is only used when it's known that they cannot resist, and once used, it cannot be undone.\" Speaking to this point, Mao Mao choked up again, and the front of Nian Bing's robe was soaked with her tears.\n\nNian Bing felt a deep sadness. Looking at Mao Mao's tear-filled eyes, his heart ached. He had always treated Mao Mao as his little sister. The once happy and carefree Mao Mao had become a homeless orphan because of the appearance of those Divine People. What was all this for? Why would those Divine People treat the peace-loving white people so cruelly? Although he couldn't bear to hear Mao Mao continue, he was eager to understand the whole process. He could only comfort Mao Mao's deeply wounded heart while asking softly, \"Then what happened? Uncle Xilard and your mother...\"\n\nMao Mao kept her head bowed. \"They died. Father and Mother both died. However, one of those six bad guys also died under the full attack of the suddenly transformed Seven-Colored Phoenix Tigers. The rest were also injured. After merging their blood, the Seven-Colored Phoenix Tigers' combat power increased linearly until the moment of their death. Therefore, the merging of blood, as the summoner's final desperate spell, is very difficult for enemies to withstand unless the power difference is too great. Unfortunately, life-bound sacred beasts are too difficult to cultivate. Only a dozen or so people in our tribe had life-bound sacred beasts, and only Father and Mother could perform the blood merging. Otherwise, no matter how powerful those bastards were, they would have paid a heavy price for killing my tribespeople. Those bad guys are very cowardly. After one of them died and the others were injured, they suddenly ran away. At that time, the Seven-Colored Phoenix Tigers themselves were at the end of their strength, and could have exploded at any moment due to their own energy. Unexpectedly, they scared those guys away.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned, \"Scared away?\" Thinking of the Divine People's selfishness and their preciousness for their own lives, Nian Bing naturally understood why they ran. Perhaps they didn't necessarily not understand that the two Seven-Colored Phoenix Tigers were at the end of their strength, but they were unwilling to suffer any harm themselves, so they chose to retreat. After all, for them, nothing was more important than life.\n\nMao Mao nodded and said, \"Yes! They ran away then. Mao Mao was crying the whole time. I was afraid something happened to Father and Mother! Those guys were too powerful. Father said each of them could defeat Father. But if they were so powerful, why did they target our white tribe? Even when Father and Mother died, they didn't understand why. After those people ran away, Father said they would definitely come back. But Father and Mother couldn't move after using the blood merging, and their complexions were so scary, so scary. Mao Mao was so scared, so scared. Father said they wouldn't live any longer, but fortunately, those people ran away early, which gave them some opportunity. Father and Mother said they wouldn't die, they would always be with Mao Mao. Then, they used our white people's unique spiritual flames to burn their bodies, and with the final help of the Seven-Colored Phoenix Tigers, they transformed into energy and stayed in my body. Before Father and Mother disappeared, Father told me to come find you and asked you to protect me. Then he told me to practice our white people's summoning techniques diligently and not to seek revenge for them unless I had absolute confidence.\"\n\nNian Bing said thoughtfully, \"So, are Uncle Xilard and your mother dead or not?\"\n\nMao Mao looked a little lost. \"I don't know. The tribal texts should have records about this, but I haven't really read them. The tribal texts were all destroyed by those bad guys. After Father and Mother died, I rode Little Stutter to come find you here. Those bad guys didn't chase me. I don't know if they were scared or if they didn't catch up. Brother Nian Bing, are Father and Mother really dead?\"\n\nHearing Mao Mao ask him back the question he had just asked her, Nian Bing suppressed his grief and looked at Mao Mao's expectant eyes. He forced a smile and said, \"Of course not! How could they bear to leave Mao Mao? I've encountered this situation before. In a certain sense, your father and mother exist in another form. Perhaps, one day, when your strength is sufficient, you will be able to awaken them. Mao Mao, whether it's to avenge your father and mother or to awaken them, you must work hard from now on. Don't worry, with me, those bad guys definitely won't find you. I will do my best to help you get revenge.\" He didn't quite know how to comfort Mao Mao now. Although he had killed two Divine People before and dealt with Divine People, Nian Bing hadn't expected that these Divine People, besides their formidable strength and selfishness, were also so cruel. Extermination, that was extermination! If their goal was to destroy all races on the Divine Continent one by one, then his choice was not wrong. No matter what problems the Lost Continent had, they were not as direct as the problems brought by the Divine Continent. The deaths of the Xilard couple had completely dispelled Nian Bing's last bit of hesitation. Mao Mao nodded seriously and said, \"Brother, Mao Mao will definitely work hard. After Father and Mother's energy entered my body, Mao Mao's mental power has grown a lot, and my little pets have also evolved very quickly. Mao Mao must avenge Father and Mother. Brother Nian Bing, Mao Mao only has you as family now, so don't leave Mao Mao like Father and Mother!\"\n\nNian Bing hugged Mao Mao, \"Don't worry, Brother will always protect Mao Mao. Mao Mao, you've lost weight, look. Brother will cook something delicious for you, okay?\"\n\nMao Mao blinked her beautiful big eyes and nodded. Looking at her tearful face, Nian Bing felt a surge of affection. He took her to the kitchen and displayed his exquisite culinary skills, preparing a table full of delicious dishes. However, when the food was served, not only Nian Bing, but even Xi Lu, who was usually a big eater, had a poor appetite. Mao Mao, after Nian Bing's coaxing, only managed to eat a little.",

    "content": "三天後。\n\n一支由一百多人組成的小隊進入了冰月城外不遠的山脈之中。這片山脈，正是當初念冰抓了冰雲後所隱藏的地方。這裡，曾經給他留下了太深的印象，而這一次，他要做的事卻完全不同。冰月堂堂主銀碭的效率很高，兩天時間，他就已經聚集了冰月堂中最精銳的高手，這些人經過他仔細的篩選，最差的也有大劍師的實力，其中半數更是達到了武鬥家級別，甚至還有兩名武聖級別的高手，可謂聚集了冰月堂幾乎所有戰鬥實力。\n\n念冰在這兩天的時間內也沒有閒著，他到冰月帝國皇宮見了燕風，就在他帶領這百餘人來到這片山脈之時，冰月帝國一個由五萬人組成的精銳軍團，在帝國元帥雪魄的帶領下，已經朝奧蘭帝國進了。比起上次變天行動之時，念冰變得更加成熟了，既然要做，他就會考慮到一切有可能發生的事。在他給血獅教奧蘭堂的信中，還專門有一封給奧蘭帝國宰相洛柔的信，在信中，他仔細的將遺失大陸<sup>1</sup>有可能歸來的消息告訴了洛柔，請她安排軍隊與冰月帝國派去的軍團匯合，在天盪山脈附近駐紮，如果遺失大陸歸來後發生不可預料的事，那麼，兩國聯軍就能在第一時間快速反應，盡量避免損失。不論是燕風還是洛柔，他們對念冰的信任都不需要多少理由，更何況遺失大陸的事如此重大，念冰在去見燕風之前信就已經送出。正是因為他相信燕風和洛柔對自己的信任。他並沒有想過憑藉兩**隊去對付那些神人，畢竟，到了他們這個級別，數量已經很難起到決定性作用了。冰月、奧蘭兩國都開始了自身地快速發展，念冰自然不希望他們有太大的損失。只要天盪山脈那邊沒有了後顧之憂，念冰也可以放手去做自己要做的事了。\n\n關於神之大陸<sup>2</sup>和遺失大陸的事，念冰詳細地與燕風交流了一整天，他並沒有隱瞞自己對這兩片大陸的任何認知，在與燕風商量後，燕風決定在物質上全力支持念冰，只要他有所要求，一概應允。他本來打算招募一批帝國中的精銳武士供念冰驅使，卻被念冰拒絕了。血獅教的秘密。念冰是不可能讓他知道的，更何況。念冰需要的是一支完全能夠聽從自己指揮的隊伍。還在冰神塔的時候，念冰已經有了自己的打算，為了即將到來的危機，他心中已經想好了全盤計劃，雖然他的計劃並不是完美的，但面對實力如此強大的神人，他也只能盡自己的全力去做了。\n\n舃鹵依舊是原來的樣子。在長生刀的作用下，他就像一名威武的人族武士，念冰拉著貓貓的手，三人走在隊伍的最前端。此時，已經是冰月帝國最冷的時節，念冰特意命人給貓貓趕製了一件厚厚的裘皮大衣禦寒，畢竟，與白人與生俱來的強大精神力相比，他們自身的缺點也很明顯。不能修煉魔法和武技的身體，使他們與普通人並沒有太大區別，對於這個可憐的小妹妹，念冰悉心呵護，惟恐她受到一點傷害。\n\n一邊走，舃鹵用鬥氣傳音向念冰問道：「兄弟，我們這是要到什麼地方去？你這血獅教的屬下確實不錯，一百多人，卻沒有任何混亂。」\n\n念冰回頭看了一眼身後的隊伍，在他背後不遠處，就是冰月堂堂主銀碭，而銀碭身後的百人，都有序地前行著，雖然這片山脈中風雪極大，天氣寒冷，但正像舃鹵所說的那樣，他們始終都能保持著整齊的隊形，沒有任何混亂之處，而且一個個面容平靜，相互之間並不交談，一邊走著，只能聽到呼嘯的北風和眾人輕巧的腳步聲，這批人讓念冰很滿意，群戰並不比單體作戰，不是僅僅依靠個人實力就能夠決定勝負的。配合更為重要，尤其是在聽從指揮這一項上，恐怕沒有比血獅教教眾再適合的人選了。離開冰月城時，念冰已經命銀碭留下人手通知即將到來的五百血衛，只要他們一趕到，就立刻會來這片山脈與自己匯合。時間不長，還有兩個月，但在這兩個月內，念冰要做的事卻有很多。\n\n隊伍中最輕鬆的就要屬貓貓了，在念冰施展的風翔術<sup>3</sup>作用下，她一直都是雙腳離地，自己根本不用出力，被念冰拉著前行。\n\n「念冰哥哥，我們什麼時候到啊！這裡好漂亮哦。」由於不用自己走路，又有念冰施展的魔法結界相互，她根本感覺不到周圍的寒冷，柔軟的裘皮大衣穿在身上說不出的溫暖。這幾天，在念冰的勸說下，單純的貓貓已經逐漸從悲傷走了出來，今天一大早他們就踏上了前進的旅途。這片山脈雖然環境惡劣，但卻能看到不可多得的冰川，那晶瑩如玉的寒冰她還是第一次見到。這裡的雪並不是很大，但風卻異常凜冽，在寒風的吹拂下，飛舞的雪花和周圍隨處可見的銀白色冰川給人一種朦朧的美感，太陽的光芒並不是那麼充足，周圍一切都是白茫茫的。\n\n念冰握緊貓貓的手，微笑道：「不遠了，你看到前面那片冰川了麼？只要到了那裡，我們也就到地方了。貓貓，你冷不冷？」\n\n貓貓搖頭道：「不冷，可暖了，哥哥，在你身邊真好。我們來這裡是幹什麼呢？」\n\n念冰道：「等我們到了地方你就會知道了。不過，哥哥可要提前告訴你，我們來這裡可不是為了玩的。雖然你並不是我訓練的目標，但是，你也不能懈怠，讓你那些寵物們好好練習，它們越厲害，你自然就會變得越厲害了。」\n\n念冰所選的地方是這裡整片山脈中最大的一片冰川，到處都可以看到那巨大地冰掛。光滑的表面上極難借力，想要攀登上去非常困難。當來到這片冰川前，念冰停了下來。看著眼前巨大的冰川，他眼中流露出一絲冷意。身後的銀碭來到念冰背後，低聲道：「教主，我們要怎麼做？」\n\n念冰淡然一笑，道：「銀堂主，你看這此起彼伏的冰川，確實是大陸上最美的景色之一啊！今後兩個月，這裡就是我們生活的地方。傳我命令，每個人在這冰川的峭壁上開鑿一個冰\n\n今後，冰洞就是你們居住的地方，這是今天的第一個任務。」\n\n銀碭沒有任何疑惑，點了點頭，大喝道：「教主有命。本教弟子聽令，冰川開洞，一人一洞，居住之用。能力強者在上，依次向下，開始。」\n\n銀碭一聲令下，一百名冰月堂屬下全部動了起來。一上午的趕路，寒冷的天氣雖然令他們有些消耗，但卻並沒有太大的影響，一道道矯捷的身影騰身而起，朝那滑不溜手的冰川上撲去，一時間鬥氣光芒閃爍，冰川上不斷傳來清脆的聲音。\n\n冰月堂弟子大多使用的是刀，在鬥氣的灌注下，刀成為了支撐他們身體的工具。在冰川上開鑿冰洞，最難的就是開始的過程，因為在冰川上很難借力。所以，一切都要靠自己對鬥氣的巧妙應用才有可能成功。看著冰月堂這百名精銳的動作，念冰滿意地點了點頭，這些屬下不愧是在北方長大的，他們並沒有直接用鬥氣去轟擊冰川，因為那樣很容易引起冰川龜裂，都是將鬥氣灌注在刀上，直接從冰川上開鑿冰洞。\n\n對於普通人來說，這是一個不可能完成的任務，但是對於這些至少是大劍師的高手，開鑿冰洞並不如何困難。不到半個時辰，最前面的冰川上已經整齊排列出一個個冰洞，冰洞雖然不算太深，但這些生長在北方的高手們都很有經驗，冰洞內是彎曲的，這樣就可以避免外面的寒風直接吹到身體，盡量保持身上的熱量。在出發前，念冰明令要求，任何人不許穿戴厚實的衣物，也不許攜帶，這就對他們的禦寒能力要求很高。\n\n銀碭飄身而落，他屬下的冰月堂弟子們重新排列好隊伍，「回稟教主，冰洞開鑿完畢。」\n\n念冰的目光掃向眾人，此時，就能看出能力的高低了，銀碭和那兩名武聖級別的高手依舊是一臉輕鬆之色，仿佛並沒有做過什麼似的，而那些武鬥家級別的也只是身上冒起一些熱氣，臉色微紅，氣息比先前粗重了一些。而最差的大劍師級別的就不是那麼輕鬆了，胸脯隨著喘息聲不斷起伏著，臉色通紅，顯然消耗不小。\n\n念冰向銀碭點了點頭，平靜的道：「你們都是本教精銳，今天我帶你們來到這裡，想必很多人還不知道因為什麼。我現在就告訴你們。」他的聲音並不高，但在精神力的覆蓋下，每個人都能夠清晰的聽到每一個字。「在兩個多月後，我將帶領你們與本教的五百血衛一起執行一個重要的任務，我想，你們也能想像的到，需要五百血衛一起參加的任務有多麼艱鉅。而在這之前的兩個月，就是我帶你們集訓的過程。兩個月的時間不算長，但也不算太短，我只是希望你們明白，現在多努力一些，在執行任務的時候，就更有可能保住自己的性命。我知道，本教弟子，都是不畏死亡的勇士。但如果能夠不死，恐怕誰也不願意離開這個世界吧。其他的我不多說了，從現在開始，我所下達的每一條命令，你們都必須立刻執行，如果誰有懈怠，我不會懲罰他，也不會殺他，但是，我卻會讓他離開這集訓的團隊。冰月堂是一個團結的集體，我希望最後不要看到有一人掉隊，否則，那將是整個冰月堂的恥辱。你們明白了麼？」最後幾個字，念冰的聲音驟然提高，精神力覆蓋到每一個人，在那穿刺極強的聲音中，所有冰月堂弟子都是全身一振，精神明顯變得興奮許多。\n\n「明白了。」龐大的聲浪響起，每個人都挺直了自己的腰杆，他們寧可面對死亡，也絕不願意成為恥辱，那樣，活著比死了更加難受。\n\n念冰微微一笑，滿意的看著這些血獅教培養起來的下屬，道：「好，那你們現在即將迎來的，將是第二個挑戰。記住我的話，誰也不許到冰洞中隱藏，這裡是你們的陣地，你們要做的，就是同心協力，相互幫助，守護好這片陣地，在你們身邊的，都是你們的戰友，你們的夥伴，你們的兄弟，我希望，最後在這裡，依舊能看到一百零一個人，好了，你們準備吧。」隨著念冰的話語，隆隆巨響聲從上方逐漸傳來，包括冰月堂堂主銀碭在內，這些血獅教的教眾們臉色終於變了，隨著隆隆聲響越來越大，他們都明白即將發生的事，而這一切還是他們自己引起的。\n\n連綿起伏的冰川之後，是一座巨大的雪山，即使在冰月帝國最暖的夏季，半山腰以上也在白雪覆蓋之中，而現在這極寒的天氣下，整座高峰都是白色的厚實的積雪在先前那突然出現的巨大聲浪中塌陷，雪花，本是無法傷人之物，但是，由積雪組成的雪崩，卻是大自然最難抗拒的幾種災難之一，雖然並不像火山爆<sup>4</sup>威力那樣強大，但雪崩的速度以及雪崩時覆蓋的面積，卻是火山爆無法比擬的。\n\n念冰一手拉著舃鹵，一手拉著貓貓，在清風吹拂下漂浮在半空之中，貓貓有些疑惑的道：「念冰哥哥，你是故意的對不對？你剛才誘他們大聲答應，就是為了這個雪崩吧。」看著那聲勢浩大的積雪澎湃而下，其中還夾雜著些堅硬的冰屑，咆哮著，衝擊著，只是一瞬間已經來到山下，將最裡面的冰川覆蓋了，數次呼吸後，已經如同巨大的冰雪怪獸一般吞噬向最後一片冰川下的血獅教眾人。\n\n念冰微微一笑，道：「他們的聲音未必能夠引起這麼大的雪崩，不過，剛才我每說一句話，都包含著精神震盪，有這些精神震盪的能量，雪山上的積雪已經鬆動，這次雪崩，你可以理解為是我故意的。只有在極端惡劣的環境下，才能培養出他們更強的實力。在這大自然的災難面前，他們想平安度過，就必須要相互配合，只有彼此協作，相互幫助，才有可能成功。」\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> 遺失大陸 (Yíshī Dàlù): Lost Continent\n<sup>2</sup> 神之大陸 (Shén zhī Dàlù): Continent of Gods\n<sup>3</sup> 風翔術 (Fēng Xiáng Shù): Wind Soaring Technique\n<sup>4</sup> 火山爆 (Huǒshān Bào): Volcanic Eruption",

    "content": "As Nian Bing's words fell silent, the Blood Lion Cult members below immediately reacted to Yin Dang's command. Though surprised, the hundred and one disciples formed a neat vertical line without panic. Yin Dang stood at the front, his long saber held high, a surge of fire-attribute battle qi condensing on it. Even in this icy wasteland, fire elements were weaker than ice, but he was a Warrior. Environmental impacts on battle qi were far less significant than on magic. The scorching airflow distorted the air around him. Yin Dang stood with his feet apart, his gaze fixed on the roaring \"Snow's Howl\" descending before them.\n\nNian Bing, floating in mid-air, couldn't help but praise internally. While an avalanche was terrifying, it was ultimately a indiscriminate, large-area impact. Under Yin Dang's command, all disciples were arranged in a single file. This meant only the person at the very front would face the surging snow, while those behind would be affected by the residual force, making them much easier to deal with. Yin Dang, by standing at the forefront himself, had done what a Hall Master should do. If the Ice Moon Hall wanted to remain disunited, it would be impossible now.\n\nA burst of fire erupted amidst the roar. A full display of a Martial Saint's power within the rumbling avalanche immediately produced a piercing shriek. Red light was insignificant compared to the surging snow mist. A ten-zhang-long stream of fire battle qi formed a straight line in the air. When the leading fire-elemental energy contacted the front of the avalanche, it exploded. A massive flame spread outwards, momentarily blocking the ice and snow surging towards Yin Dang's position, while the snow on both sides continued to crash down.\n\nWithout hesitation, Yin Dang leaped up, and a figure behind him swiftly floated forward, replacing his previous position. The long saber in his hand struck out without pause, releasing a ball of green light with a clearer shriek that blasted forward. At this moment, Yin Dang's full-force battle qi had been engulfed by the avalanche, and the snow behind was already upon them.\n\nThe green light also exploded as the avalanche charged forward. However, this time, it was wind-attribute battle qi that dealt with the avalanche. The explosion of wind battle qi was spiral-shaped. The massive battle qi formed a rapidly rotating mini-tornado before the avalanche. While this tornado wasn't as magnificent or as wide-reaching as a magical whirlwind, its condensation was far beyond that of ordinary wind magic. For a moment, the descending snow was again obstructed. Anything that came into contact with the wind battle qi was immediately swept aside, adding momentum to the snow crashing down on the sides.\n\nAt this moment, the Martial Saint using wind battle qi also leaped back. The last Martial Saint, like a shifting phantom, arrived at the very front. He was the only one among the hundred and one disciples not using a weapon. With fists clenched, he simply adopted a horse stance, let out a low cry, and simultaneously punched out with both fists. Yin Dang's fire battle qi could deflect a large amount of the snow's impact with the \"Unload\" technique. Although battle qi's intensity was greater than magic, its duration could not be compared to magic. At this moment, the green tornado was gradually weakening, and the snow on the sides was converging in the center. Two earthy yellow lights met the fists. It was a straightforward attack. Earth-attribute battle qi's defensive properties were stronger than other attributes. Moreover, this Martial Saint, who appeared to be around sixty years old, possessed a purity of battle qi that surpassed even Yin Dang, the Hall Master of Ice Moon Hall. As the yellow battle qi surged forth, it created explosions in the air with every inch it advanced. Each step forward caused the two balls of yellow light to shrink. When the wind tornado disappeared and the avalanche fiercely surged forward, the two balls of yellow light had shrunk from the size of a human head to the size of a fist. The Earth-attribute Martial Saint let out another great shout and forcefully brought his hands together in front of him. The two balls of earthy yellow light suddenly merged. Immediately, a roar, no less than that of the avalanche, erupted. Amidst the swirling snow, a massive explosive force directly extended ten zhang outwards from the center of the explosion. What was most remarkable was the Martial Saint's exquisite control over his battle qi, causing the expansion of the battle qi explosion to follow almost precisely his intended direction, rolling back against the avalanche. This bought more time for those behind him.\n\nWith three Martial Saints attacking in turns, their speed could be gauged by the time it took for the avalanche to descend. From the moment Yin Dang launched his first attack, the avalanche had already begun its descent with extreme ferocity. By the time the three Martial Saints completed their first round of interception, the snow on the sides had just grazed past the three of them. Over a distance of fifteen zhang, the three Martial Saints had each unleashed a full-power attack, barely halting the frontal impact of the avalanche. As the snow mist surged past, the Warriors behind them moved in unison, their battle qi emanating from their bodies and spreading outwards to protect their flanks. The strongest Martial Artists at the front, before the three Martial Saints had even leaped up and landed, unleashed several palm strikes forward, meeting the avalanche's impact head-on, allowing Yin Dang to land and commence the second round of attacks. The avalanche's momentum was too fierce. From Yin Dang's position, only a terrifying snow mist was visible, making it impossible to determine how long the avalanche would last.\n\nBeside Nian Bing, Xi Lu said with some surprise, \"Nian Bing, their method is very effective. Even I couldn't resist such a strong avalanche for a long time and would certainly be buried. Then I'd have to break out of the snow by myself. But their tactics are very well-executed, allowing for almost continuous attacks. Although this avalanche is powerful, as long as they can hold on for a while, they will definitely be able to handle it. However, dealing with this avalanche requires a considerable amount of battle qi. I estimate that at most five of them can attack forward simultaneously.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"The strategy they are using is wolf pack tactics. In the wilderness, for wolf packs to survive in cold environments, they must accurately judge the direction when the cold wind appears. With the alpha wolf at the front and the rest of the wolves behind, arranged in a vertical line, when the alpha wolf can no longer withstand the cold wind, it will move to the rear to rest, and the second wolf will take its place, and so on, until they endure the cold wind. Yin Tang and the others are using this tactic now, though it is much more difficult for them to apply, as they are facing an avalanche.\"\n\nNian Bing understood what Xi Lu meant by five people attacking simultaneously. In a vertical formation, only the first person could attack forward. The people behind could attack forward from the left and right shoulders and the left and right waist of the person in front, instantly achieving the effect of five people attacking together. While they were talking, the three Martial Saints in front had completed three rounds of attacks, and the avalanche had approached within ten zhang from their position fifteen zhang away. The three Martial Saints had each unleashed three consecutive full-power attacks, consuming a great deal of battle qi. As they leaped up for the last time, Yin Dang gave the order.\n\nThe three Martial Artists behind simultaneously attacked, pushing out a palm strike, and as their battle qi blasted forth, the three leaped up. Like Yin Dang and the other three Martial Saints, they lightly tapped on the shoulders of their companions and retreated to the rear of the formation. The Martial Artists and Warriors behind them, in groups of three, each pushed out a palm strike and immediately took flight. They resisted while retreating, forming a beautiful arc in the air. Each person moved without any pause or hesitation. Their coordination was extremely precise, both resisting and retreating. For a moment, they managed to prevent the avalanche's forward momentum from accelerating, allowing it to approach them only inch by inch. When the attack reached the Martial Artists of the Grand Swordsman level, it was changed to groups of five. Similar battle qi strikes achieved roughly the same effect. At such a time, if even one group had a problem, it would immediately cause a complete collapse of the formation. However, these hundred experts of the Ice Moon Hall showed no signs of panic, repelling the avalanche's attacks wave after wave as they gradually retreated.\n\nAlthough the avalanche's power was immense, it came and went quickly. The fierce impact lasted for a short while before moving away from Yin Dang and the others and continuing its charge downwards. Beneath the original glacier, a strange scene unfolded. Where Yin Dang and the hundred people in the isosceles triangle formation were, deep ravines had been formed. On both sides were snowdrifts up to three zhang high, and they remained in a vertical formation within these ravines. Including the three Martial Saints, everyone was breathing heavily. After three cycles of resistance, everyone's consumption was enormous.\n\nNian Bing, along with Xi Lu and Mao Mao, floated down onto the snowdrifts beside the ravine. Under the effect of the Wind Soaring Technique, they left no trace on the snow. Nian Bing's voice reached every member of the Ice Moon Hall, \"How do you feel? This is the power of nature. However, the avalanche's impact only descends along the mountain's slope. What do you think was the power of this impact? I can tell you that if measured by magic, this avalanche's impact is equivalent to the energy of a Divine Descent spell, but in terms of impact power, it is at most at the level of a forbidden spell. This is because the avalanche's coverage is too vast and it is not artificially controlled, causing energy dispersion. If you encountered a Divine Descent Master, then an avalanche spell would not be something you could resist with this method. I allowed you to experience this avalanche baptism for two reasons: first, to see your level of cooperation, and second, to inform you that in two months, we will be facing ten enemies whose strength reaches or even exceeds that of a Divine Descent spell capable of unleashing an avalanche. In two months, I hope you can undergo significant changes. Two months is not a long time. Whether you can destroy enemies in battle while preserving your own lives depends on your own abilities. You can rest in place for one hour. After one hour, you must find your own ice cave in the snowdrift; I have said that it will be your resting place for the next two months. I will give you a total of three hours. After three hours, I will inform you of the training plan for this two-month period. This plan is extremely difficult, so I hope you are mentally prepared.\"\n\nEven if the warriors of the Ice Moon Hall were mentally prepared, they could not have imagined the training Nian Bing had in store for them. Three hours later, when Nian Bing announced his plan, all hundred and one of them were stunned, staring blankly at the Blood Lion Cult Leader before them, none daring to believe it was true.\n\n\"Cult Leader, you mean you want us to level this snow mountain in two months?\" Yin Dang couldn't believe his ears. The tallest snow mountain in this range was thousands of zhang high. Let alone two months, they couldn't flatten the snow mountain in two years! This was simply an impossible mission.\n\nNian Bing looked at the majestic snow mountain standing hundreds of zhang away and said calmly, \"That's right. In two months, all one hundred and one of you will be divided into three groups, led by three Martial Saints, including Hall Master Yin. The strength will be evenly distributed. Each group will train for four hours a day. You can use any method you can achieve to forcibly confront the snow mountain. In two months, this place will become flat land. In about half a month, when the five hundred Blood Guards arrive here, they will do the same as you, with six hundred people attacking the snow mountain together. Except for the four hours of attacking the snow mountain each day, you will remain in the ice caves for self-cultivation and recovery of battle qi consumed during training. I will be responsible for food and water, so you don't need to worry.\"\n\nYin Dang said with difficulty, \"But, Cult Leader, this is truly too difficult. Let alone us, even one hundred Martial Saints couldn't complete this mission!\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes flashed with cold light. \"How do you know it's impossible if you haven't tried? I've measured it. Half of this snow mountain is covered by ice and snow, and the other half is rock. I hope you can understand a principle: as long as you work hard, nothing is impossible. Watch.\" As he spoke, he leaped into the air, and green light points condensed beneath him, as if a cloud were supporting Nian Bing's body as he floated up. Everyone's gaze followed Nian Bing into the sky. These elites of the Blood Lion Cult's Ice Moon Hall quickly witnessed their Cult Leader's strength.\n\nWhen Nian Bing floated to an altitude of nine hundred zhang, he stopped. Golden light flashed at his brow, and countless black light points converged into black light bands, gathering towards his body. Slowly, Nian Bing raised his right hand, and a giant black shadow, six zhang high, gradually appeared behind him. Although he was far from the ground, he deliberately dispersed the surrounding ice mist, allowing his subordinates below to clearly see what he was doing.\n\nThe six-zhang-high black figure gradually became clear. Beneath the black robe, it exuded a gloomy aura, making even the sun in the sky dim. Nian Bing's lower abdomen, touched by the golden light from his brow, also turned golden. The surrounding black energy condensed even faster as he raised his right hand, and the giant black shadow behind him also raised its right hand. Surging dark elemental energy, filled with corrosive and dark auras, condensed in the black figure's large hand. A giant scythe, ten zhang long with a seven-zhang-long blade, gradually took shape. Seven black gems were embedded on the scythe's blade. Although they were the same color as the blade, they emitted a terrifying aura. Nian Bing's pair of deep blue eyes turned deep black at this moment, and faint seven-colored light emerged, completely enveloping him and the black figure behind him. A low voice echoed throughout the entire mountain range, \"Death—God—Scythe—.\"\n\nNian Bing swung his right hand horizontally, and the giant black figure behind him also swung its right hand and the giant scythe held in its right hand. Those below saw a black curtain of light slash horizontally. As they gaped in astonishment, the black curtain of light had already infiltrated the mountainside nine hundred zhang up. As if nothing had happened, Nian Bing's black figure behind him gradually faded. However, a diagonal black mark appeared on the white snow mountain. Suddenly, the black mark seemed to light up. Immediately, the mountain peak above the mark moved. It moved slightly, then faster and faster. The mountain peak, which was a hundred zhang high, slowly moved along the diagonal mark. The moment the peak completely separated from the mountain body, all the disciples of the Ice Moon Hall would never forget what they saw. The peak slid sideways along the mountain body. A thunderous roar, at least ten times louder than that of the previous avalanche, erupted as the peak plunged into the valley.\n\nThe entire mountain range trembled violently because of Nian Bing's powerful strike. For a moment, countless snow peaks triggered avalanches, and the entire mountain range sobbed because of Nian Bing's peerless strike.\n\nThe earth's trembling lasted for a full quarter of an hour. When everything calmed down, the original thousand-zhang peak was truly only nine hundred zhang, with its tip gone. Nothing could be more real.\n\nNian Bing's body slowly descended from the sky, his expression unchanged. Among those present, only Xi Lu understood. Nian Bing's previous strike clearly displayed the strength of a level thirteen being, no longer just an eleventh-level Dark Forbidden Spell. Under the amplification of the Heavenly Eye domain and the innate dark attribute qi generated by the full operation of the Western Scripture acupoints, the level thirteen attack had flattened the peak. Xi Lu believed that even he, using the power of the Dwarven Axe for his strongest attack, could only achieve a similar effect, yet Nian Bing appeared so relaxed, as if all of this were nothing.\n\nIf the warriors of the Ice Moon Hall were filled with surprise and confusion when Nian Bing announced the training methods, then at this moment, their emotions had transformed into deep shock. Everything Nian Bing had done was beyond words for them. The mission Yin Dang had described as impossible was completed by Nian Bing by one-tenth in an instant. Perhaps the hundred zhang area of the peak was not as large as the base, but now, no one doubted that Nian Bing could level this snow mountain by himself. With a ratio of one hundred and one to one, no one uttered any further objections. In their eyes, this young Cult Leader of the Blood Lion Cult had become a divine being. If any disciples of the Ice Moon Hall had previously been unconvinced of Nian Bing, after witnessing the kiss of the Death God Scythe, they had no further doubts. Respecting the strong was an eternal principle. Nian Bing did not waste more words; he showed his subordinates through his actions what a true powerhouse was.\n\nFloating down, Nian Bing was still wearing his simple cloth clothes. However, in the eyes of his subordinates, Nian Bing now appeared exceptionally tall, as unassailable as the snow mountain.\n\nWithout further explanation, Nian Bing directly issued the order, \"Hall Master Yin of the Ice Moon Hall, lead your thirty-three subordinates and begin mountain destruction training. They will be replaced after four hours. The rest will rest in the ice caves.\"\n\n\"Yes, Cult Leader.\" The hundred and one voices seemed to come from one person, their synchronized sound filled with absolute reverence. Yin Dang glanced deeply at Nian Bing and, with his thirty-two subordinates, headed towards the summit at the fastest possible speed. The remaining sixty-odd people silently walked towards the ice caves nearby and began cultivating within them.\n\nXi Lu gave Nian Bing a thumbs-up, a smile of approval on his face. Nian Bing returned the smile and said, \"I think these two months will be very beneficial for them. Now, I should also prepare some things for my subordinates. Mao Mao, you and Brother Xi Lu stay here. You practice your mental magic and release all your little pets to join the Ice Moon Hall members in destroying the mountain.\"\n\nMao Mao asked curiously, \"Nian Bing brother, what are you going to do? Won't you stay with Mao Mao?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"Brother has some matters to attend to. I'll be back within two days. During these two days, my subordinates will have no food and will expend so much physical energy. This will be a great test for them, but as long as they endure these two days, their strength will surely improve. Training isn't just about external factors; it also needs to start from within the body. Mao Mao, Brother Xi Lu has enough dry rations for you for two days. Be good and obedient. Nian Bing brother will be back soon and will definitely bring you delicious food.\"\n\nAlthough Mao Mao was reluctant, she knew Nian Bing had important matters to attend to and could only nod helplessly, \"Nian Bing brother, then you must go and come back soon.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and nodded at Mao Mao, then leaped into the air. If the subordinates of the Ice Moon Hall could see what their Cult Leader was doing now, they would likely be even more astonished. Gray light points condensed beneath Nian Bing. Oscar let out a joyous dragon roar, spread his vast wings, and enveloped in gold-gray light, whisked Nian Bing away in the blink of an eye from Mao Mao and Xi Lu's sight.\n\n\"A dragon! It's a dragon! When did Nian Bing brother become a dragon summoner? But his summoning method is so strange,\" Mao Mao said with some confusion, looking in the direction Nian Bing had disappeared.\n\nXi Lu smiled slightly and said, \"Your Nian Bing brother always does something marvelous. Mao Mao, you should start cultivating too. Let Brother Xi Lu see your summoned beasts.\" Xi Lu genuinely liked this little sister, perhaps because they shared the same fate of losing their parents. From the first time he met Mao Mao, Xi Lu felt a desire to protect her.\n\nMao Mao said excitedly, \"No problem. Brother Xi Lu, watch this. My little pets have all evolved to be very powerful. In the name of my Xi Yun, I summon you, Sweetie, Lightie, Na Na, Strongie, Official!\" If Nian Bing were here, he would be astonished to find that what Mao Mao was performing was a group summoning technique, which was at least several times more difficult than her previous single summons. Faint silver light enveloped Mao Mao's body. She pointed her hands in front of her, and a silver light circle with a diameter of three zhang appeared out of thin air. Immediately, five figures of black, white, red, black, and pink colors emerged from the silver light. As they extended outwards, these five figures gradually grew larger. When they landed on the ground, their true forms were revealed.\n\nXi Lu was initially puzzled, wondering what \"sweet\" and \"light\" meant and if they were edible. But when he saw Mao Mao's summoned beasts, he couldn't help but be surprised. The five beasts varied in size, but all exuded powerful auras. He recognized one of them: that fat, mountain-sized body, wasn't it Nian Bing's Dark Demonic Rat? How did it become Mao Mao's pet?\n\nMao Mao said proudly, \"Brother Xi Lu, let me introduce them to you.\" As she spoke, she pointed at the mountain-like big rat and said, \"This is Sweetie, a Dark Demonic Rat. Its best ability is digging and defense. It's a mixed beast of dark and earth elements. It has now evolved to the fifth stage and can manipulate some dark and earth magic. Its own defense is very strong, like a moving fortress, making it one of the best defensive pets. Oh, Nian Bing brother also has a Dark Demonic Rat, and his Dark Demonic Rat is Sweetie's mother.\"\n\nHearing Mao Mao say this, Xi Lu finally understood and exclaimed, \"Indeed, the Dark Demonic Rat's digging skill is quite impressive. When I helped Nian Bing rescue his parents, I relied heavily on that big rat.\"\n\nMao Mao's hand moved from the black Dark Demonic Rat Sweetie to the white figure beside it and said with a smile, \"This is Lightie, the big cow Lightie. It's a Golden Bull with explosive power, known for its 'golden milk.' Lightie's ability is milk spray. It has also evolved to the fifth stage. Now, Lightie can not only spray golden milk with very strong attack power, but its milk also has auxiliary effects. As long as other pets drink its milk, they can instantly enter a berserk state, increasing their strength by 1.5 times their normal level. Lightie is relatively proficient in attack and support, considered a semi-offensive, semi-support pet.\"\n\nThe current \"Lightie\" was completely different from what Nian Bing had seen before. Its fur was mainly white, with black only on its back. Before the second stage, its size was no different from an ordinary dairy cow. But now it had grown to a giant dairy cow, three zhang long and two zhang high. Its black and white fur was extremely lustrous. The horns that shouldn't have appeared on a dairy cow's head were now present. They were a pair of lustrous white horns. Beneath its belly, eight large golden udders hung down, emitting a strange fragrance. Its pair of huge cow eyes were fixed on the red figure beside it.\n\nMao Mao followed the gaze of the dairy cow Lightie to the red figure. Among the five pets, this golden-red figure was the most beautiful. It was about one zhang long, and its golden-red fur emitted a dazzling brilliance. Na Na was much prettier than before, especially its large tail, which looked extremely beautiful. Below its tail grew a golden-red spur about three feet long. It lay lazily on the ground, its only unchanged lewd gaze fixed on the golden udders beneath the dairy cow's belly, as if ready to attack at any moment. Lightie seemed helpless against it. Although vigilant, it did not dodge. Mao Mao said with a smile, \"Na Na is the strategist among my little pets, or rather, the fox-head strategist. Don't look at its beautiful appearance; it's actually full of tricks. It's also the only fully supportive pet among my little pets, also called a harassment type pet. Although it doesn't have much attack power, its role is quite significant. After evolving to the fifth stage, Na Na now has five skills, making it one of the pets with the most skills. It can cause a lot of trouble for enemies with its skills. Its own name should be 'Golden Lewd Fox.' It was originally the natural enemy of Lightie, and Lightie's golden milk is very beneficial to it, acting as the best tonic. Therefore, Lightie hates it the most, but it always clings to Lightie, drinking Lightie's milk whenever it has the chance. As for its skills, you will definitely see them in the future. Although it's not the most powerful one, it's definitely the most important one. Its lewdness and depravity are the nightmare of all enemies, and even their own allies.\"\n\nNa Na clearly heard Mao Mao's words. Its lewd gaze flickered, and its mouth curved into what seemed like a lascivious smile. Seeing its expression, even Xi Lu couldn't help but be surprised. Humans could be lewd, but compared to the lewd gaze of this fox, they were far inferior. Na Na's gaze fell upon Mao Mao's well-developed delicate body. Mao Mao's pretty face blushed, and she glared, \"What are you looking at? Be careful, I'll castrate you and make you a eunuch fox.\" Upon hearing this, Na Na quickly shrank back, covering its head with its large golden-red tail, not even daring to look at the dairy cow Lightie.\n\nMao Mao continued, \"As for the fourth one, it's my cockroach Strongie. Cockroaches are relatively special pets. It's an Illusionary Demonic Cockroach, and its best ability is illusion, also known as self-illusion. Strongie's own attack ability is also reflected in its illusions. After reaching the fifth stage, it can transform into any of my pets using its special abilities and possess half of their attack power. Although Strongie's attack power isn't very strong, its defense and illusions are the best way to protect me. Its escape speed is also very fast, and if it cooperates with Sweetie, it can take me away quickly underground. Unfortunately, they cannot escape mental lock tracking, otherwise, Father and Mother wouldn't have...\" Mentioning her parents, Mao Mao's eyes instantly turned red, and her expression became considerably melancholic.",

    "content": "A six-zhang-tall black figure gradually became clearer. Beneath the black robe, it exuded a somber aura, causing even the sun in the sky to dim.\n\nNian Bing's lower abdomen, touched by the golden light from his brow, also turned golden. The surrounding black energy, as he raised his right hand, condensed even faster. The colossal black shadow behind him similarly raised its right hand, and surging dark elements, filled with corrosive and gloomy energy, condensed in the black figure's large hand. A giant scythe, ten zhang long with a blade seven zhang long, gradually took shape. The scythe's edge bore seven black gemstones. Though the same color as the blade, they emanated a terrifying aura.\n\nNian Bing's deep azure eyes turned a profound black at this moment, with a faint seven-colored light emerging, completely enshrouding him and the black figure behind him. His low voice echoed throughout the mountain range, \"God -- Reaper's -- Scythe --.\"\n\nNian Bing's right hand swung horizontally. The colossal black figure behind him also swung its right hand, and the giant scythe grasped in its right hand. Below, the onlookers saw a black curtain of light slash horizontally. As they widened their mouths in astonishment, the black light curtain had already invaded the mountainside nine hundred zhang up the Snow Mountain. It was as if nothing had happened. The black figure behind Nian Bing gradually faded.\n\nHowever, a diagonal black mark appeared on the pure white Snow Mountain. Suddenly, the black mark seemed to flash. Immediately, the mountain peak above the mark moved. It moved slightly, then faster and faster. The mountain peak, a hundred zhang high, slowly shifted along the slanting mark. The moment the peak completely separated from the mountain body, all the Ice Moon Hall disciples would never forget the scene before them: the peak slid sideways down the mountain body.\n\nA thunderous roar, at least ten times louder than a previous avalanche, erupted as the peak plunged into the valley.\n\nThe entire mountain range trembled violently, shaking from Nian Bing's powerful strike. In an instant, countless snow peaks triggered avalanches, and the entire mountain range wailed due to Nian Bing's peerless blow.\n\nThe earth's trembling lasted for a full quarter of an hour. When everything calmed down, the original thousand-zhang peak was genuinely left at nine hundred zhang. The peak was gone, and nothing could have been more real.\n\nNian Bing's body slowly descended from the sky, his expression unchanged. Among those present, only Xi Lu understood. Nian Bing's previous strike was clearly the power of a thirteenth-rank, no longer an eleventh-rank dark forbidden curse. Amplified by the Heavenly Eye domain and the innate dark energy from the full operation of the West Meridian acupoint, the thirteenth-rank attack had leveled the peak. Xi Lu believed that even he, with the full might of the Dwarf God Axe, could not achieve such an effect with his strongest attack, yet Nian Bing appeared so relaxed, as if it was nothing.\n\nIf the warriors of the Ice Moon Hall were filled with surprise and confusion when Nian Bing announced the training methods, their feelings had now transformed into deep shock. Everything Nian Bing had done was beyond words for them.\n\nThe mission that Yin Dang had deemed impossible was now one-tenth completed by Nian Bing in an instant.\n\nPerhaps the hundred-zhang area of the peak was not as large as the base, but no one doubted now that Nian Bing could level this Snow Mountain with his own power. One hundred and one to one; no one could voice any dissent. In their eyes, this young leader of the Blood Lion Sect had become a god-like existence. If any Ice Moon Hall disciple had previously harbored disrespect for Nian Bing,\n\nafter witnessing the Kiss of the Death Reaper's Scythe, they had no further doubts. Respecting the strong was an eternal truth. Nian Bing did not waste further words; he used his actions to show his subordinates what true strength was.\n\nAlighting softly, Nian Bing was still dressed in his coarse cloth clothes. However, in the eyes of his subordinates, Nian Bing now appeared exceptionally tall, as unscalable as the Snow Mountain.\n\nWithout further explanation, Nian Bing directly issued an order: \"Ice Moon Hall Master Yin Dang, lead your thirty-three subordinates and begin the mountain destruction training. Rotate every four hours. The rest will rest in the ice caves.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sect Leader.\" The hundred and one voices seemed to come from a single person, their synchronized sound filled with utter respect. Yin Dang gave Nian Bing a deep look and, with his thirty-two subordinates, headed towards the summit at the fastest speed. The remaining sixty-odd people silently walked towards the nearby ice caves, each beginning their cultivation within.\n\nXi Lu extended his thumb to Nian Bing, a smile of approval on his face. Nian Bing returned the smile and said, \"I believe these two months will be very beneficial for them. Now, I should prepare some things for my subordinates. Mao Mao, you and Brother Xi Lu stay here. You practice mental magic and release all your little pets to join the Ice Moon Hall disciples in destroying the mountain.\"\n\nMao Mao asked curiously, \"Brother Nian Bing, what are you going to do? Aren't you staying with Mao Mao?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Brother has some business to attend to. I will return within two days. During these two days, my subordinates will have no food to eat and will expend so much physical energy. This will be a great test for them. But as long as they persevere for two days, their strength will surely improve. Training is not only about external factors; it must also begin from within the body. Mao Mao, Brother Xi Lu has enough dry rations for you to eat for two days. Be good, Brother Nian Bing will return soon, and I will bring you back some delicious things.\"\n\nAlthough Mao Mao was reluctant, she knew Nian Bing had important matters to attend to and could only nod helplessly. \"Brother Nian Bing, you must return soon.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and nodded at Mao Mao, then floated away. If the subordinates of the Ice Moon Hall saw what their Sect Leader was doing now, they would likely be even more astonished. Gray light points condensed beneath Nian Bing. Oscar let out a joyful dragon's roar, spread his broad wings, and enveloped in golden-gray light, took Nian Bing away in the blink of an eye, disappearing from Mao Mao and Xi Lu's sight.\n\n\"A dragon, it's a dragon! When did Brother Nian Bing become a dragon summoner? But his summoning method is so strange,\" Mao Mao said, looking somewhat puzzled in the direction Nian Bing disappeared.\n\nXi Lu smiled slightly and said, \"Your Brother Nian Bing always does wonderful things. Mao Mao, you should start your cultivation as well. Let Brother Xi Lu see your summoned beasts.\" Xi Lu genuinely liked this little sister, perhaps because they shared a similar fate, having both lost their parents. From the first time he saw Mao Mao, Xi Lu felt a desire to protect her from the bottom of his heart.\n\nMao Mao said excitedly, \"No problem. Brother Xi Lu, look! My little pets have all evolved to be very powerful. I summon you in the name of Xi Yun, come out, Tian Tian, Dan Dan, Na Na, Qiang Qiang, Guan Guan!\" If Nian Bing were present, he would be astonished to find that Mao Mao was using a group summoning technique, which was several times more difficult than her previous single summons. A faint silver light surrounded Mao Mao's body. She pointed her hands in front of her, and a silver light star with a diameter of three zhang appeared out of nowhere. Immediately, five figures of black, white, red, black, and pink colors emerged simultaneously from the silver light. As they extended outward, these five figures gradually grew larger. When they landed on the ground, they had revealed their true forms.\n\nXi Lu was initially wondering what \"sweet\" and \"light\" were, could they be eaten? But when he saw Mao Mao's summoned beasts, he couldn't help but be surprised. The five beasts, varying in size, all exuded powerful auras. Xi Lu recognized one of them: its obese, mountain-like body, wasn't that Nian Bing's Dark Demon Rat? How did it become Mao Mao's pet?\n\nMao Mao said proudly, \"Brother Xi Lu, let me introduce them!\" As she spoke, she pointed to the mountain-like big rat and said, \"This is Tian Tian, a Dark Demon Rat. It is best at digging and defense, belonging to the dual dark and earth element magical beast. It has now evolved to the fifth stage and can manipulate some dark and earth element magic. Its own defense is very strong, like a mobile fortress, making it one of the best defensive pets. Oh, and Brother Nian Bing also has a Dark Demon Rat, and his Dark Demon Rat is Tian Tian's mother!\"\n\nHearing Mao Mao's words, Xi Lu finally understood and exclaimed, \"Indeed, this Dark Demon Rat's digging skills are truly remarkable. When I helped Nian Bing rescue his parents, I was greatly indebted to that big rat.\"\n\nMao Mao's hand moved from the black Dark Demon Rat Tian Tian to the white figure beside it and said with a smile, \"This is Dan Dan, Big Milk Cow Dan Dan. It's a golden bull with immense milk, known for its 'explosive golden milk.' Dan Dan's ability is milk projection. It has also evolved to the fifth stage. Now, Dan Dan can not only project golden milk with strong attack power but also has support effects. As long as other pets drink its milk, they can instantly enter a berserk state, increasing their strength by 1.5 times their normal level. Dan Dan is relatively adept at attack and support, being a half-attack, half-support pet.\"\n\nThe current milk cow Dan Dan was completely different from what Nian Bing had seen before. Its fur was predominantly white, with black only on its back. Before the second stage, its size was no different from an ordinary milk cow, but now it had grown to be three zhang long and two zhang tall, a giant milk cow. The black and white fur appeared extremely lustrous. Horns, which should not appear on a milk cow's head, had grown on it – a pair of lustrous white horns. Beneath its belly, eight large golden udders hung down, emitting a peculiar fragrance. Its huge cow eyes were staring at the red figure beside it.\n\nMao Mao followed Dan Dan's gaze to the red figure. Among the five pets, this golden-red figure was the most beautiful. It was about one zhang long, and its golden-red fur emitted a dazzling radiance. Na Na was much more beautiful than before, especially its huge tail, which looked extremely gorgeous. Below its tail, a golden-red stinger about three feet long had grown. It lay lazily on the ground, its only unchanged lewd gaze fixed on the golden udders beneath the milk cow's belly, as if ready to strike at any moment.\n\nDan Dan seemed helpless against it. Although vigilant, it did not dodge. Mao Mao smiled and said, \"Na Na is the 'dog-headed strategist' of my little pets, no, it should be a 'fox-headed strategist.' Don't be fooled by its beautiful appearance; it's full of mischief.\n\nIt is also the only fully supportive pet among my little pets, or you could call it a harassment type pet. Although it doesn't have much attack power, its role is not small. After evolving to the fifth stage, Na Na now has five skills, making it one of the pets with the most skills. It can cause great trouble to enemies with its skills. Its actual name should be Golden Lewd Fox. It was originally Dan Dan's natural enemy. Dan Dan's golden milk is very beneficial to it, acting as the best supplement, so Dan Dan hates it the most. However, it always clings to Dan Dan, drinking Dan Dan's milk whenever it has the chance. As for its skills, you will definitely see them later. Although it is not the most powerful, it is definitely the most important. Its lewdness and promiscuity are a nightmare for all enemies, and even their own allies.\"\n\nNa Na obviously heard Mao Mao's words. Its lewd gaze flickered, and its mouth curved, seemingly chuckling lewdly. Seeing its gaze, even Xi Lu couldn't help but be surprised. Humans could be lewd, but compared to this fox's lewd gaze, it was far inferior. Na Na's gaze fell on Mao Mao's well-developed delicate body. Mao Mao's cheeks blushed, and she chided, \"What are you looking at? Be careful, I'll castrate you and make you a eunuch fox.\" Upon hearing this, Na Na quickly retracted its head and covered its head with its golden-red tail, not even daring to look at the milk cow Dan Dan.\n\nMao Mao continued, \"As for the fourth one, it's my cockroach Qiang Qiang. Cockroaches are relatively special pets. It's an illusion magic cockroach, and its best ability is illusion, also known as original body illusion. Qiang Qiang's own attack ability is also reflected in its illusions. After reaching the fifth stage, it can transform into any of my pets with its special ability and possess half of their attack power. Although Qiang Qiang's attack is not very strong, its defense and illusion are the best abilities to protect me. It's also very fast at escaping. If it cooperates with Tian Tian, it can take me underground and escape quickly. Unfortunately, they cannot escape spiritual power lock tracking, otherwise, Dad and Mom wouldn't have...\" Mentioning her parents, Mao Mao's eyes immediately reddened, and her expression became considerably dejected.",

    "content": "舄鹵 had been in the human world for some time. Seeing Mao Mao's expression, he naturally knew she was upset. He quickly pointed to the last pink creature and said, \"What about this one? Is this a pig? I've never seen such a big pig before. Is it powerful? This guy is really fat. I wonder how much it weighs.\" He spoke naturally, and indeed, it was his first time seeing such a large pig, and a pink one at that. Guan Guan's body was so magnificent that it was even a bit larger than the big rat Tiantian. Its entire body was like a giant sphere, having long lost its former adorable appearance. Even standing there, its entire body trembled with fat, yet it exuded a kingly aura, with a proud expression.\n\nHearing Xi Lu's words, before Mao Mao could speak, Guan Guan grunted twice and actually said in a deep, muffled voice, \"What's wrong with being fat? Haven't you heard that spherical is also a figure?\"\n\nXiu Lu was so surprised his mouth fell open. He had seen many magical beasts, but even the few subdued by Nian Bing were considered powerful magical beasts on the Divine Continent, and none could speak human language.\n\nSeeing Xiu Lu's surprised look, Mao Mao's sadness lessened slightly, and she smiled, \"Guan Guan is very smart. Because it has a tail like a chrysanthemum on its back, it's named the Pink Chrysanthemum Pig. Although the name sounds ordinary, it is one of the kings of pets. Its strength is comparable to that of a dragon, and it is also the strongest pet among our White clan. If Guan Guan could have evolved to the sixth rank as it is now when our White clan was attacked, perhaps my parents and I could have escaped safely without them releasing their Natal Sacred Beasts. Guan Guan has very strong defenses, and its attack power is even more formidable. It only has one skill, but this single skill makes its attack power comparable to that of the dragon clan. Its skill, Beast Blood Boil, has reached a considerable level of attack power after it reached the sixth rank. Although it's not as powerful as Nian Bing's mountain-splitting strike earlier, it can still cause the earth to shake and mountains to tremble.\"\n\nChrysanthemum Pig. This is truly a strange species. Xiu Lu observed Guan Guan. Guan Guan's pig eyes, much larger than before, were also staring at him, with hot air spewing from its large nostrils.\n\nMao Mao giggled and said, \"Alright, little pets. Go, it's time to break the mountain.\" At her command, the four pets, excluding Nala the fox, were about to move when Xiu Lu stopped them. \"Wait a moment, Mao Mao.\" Although Xiu Lu didn't know the full strength of these five pets, he had dealt with the Dark Magic Rat. The formidable earth-piercing ability of Tiantian's mother had left a deep impression on him. \"Mao Mao, I think it's best not to have these pets of yours participate in breaking the mountain. I think Nian Bing definitely doesn't know how strong your pets have become. If they participate in the mountain-destroying operation, I'm afraid Nian Bing's subordinates will have less experience. You should recall them. However, this fox always looks lazy. I think it can be allowed to train.\"\n\nNala, who had been lying on the ground, heard Xiu Lu's words and suddenly stood up. The lewdness in its eyes turned into anger. It whined a few times, baring its teeth and emitting a hostile aura.\n\nMao Mao said, \"That's right! Nala doesn't have much attack ability and is very lazy. Although it has been evolving rapidly recently, its body really needs some exercise. Nala, you go then.\"\n\nThe dairy cow beside them mooed with schadenfreude, excitedly rolling on the ground. Nala whined twice more, seemingly begging for mercy.\n\nMao Mao snorted, \"What are you so happy about, Dandan? Go, you and Nala go together. Your attack power isn't very strong either. It's a good chance to train together with Nala.\"\n\nAs she spoke, her hands flashed with silver light, and she recalled Guan Guan the Chrysanthemum Pig, Qiangqiang the Phantom Magic Cockroach, and Tiantian the Dark Magic Rat.\n\nThe dairy cow's joy turned to sorrow, and it froze for a moment. Nala was extremely fast, turning into a golden-red figure and instantly appearing beneath Dandan. It sucked greedily a few times on the golden milk, and before Dandan could react, it let out a lewd and suggestive cry and quickly ran towards the snow mountain.\n\nXiu Lu laughed heartily, \"Your pets are truly spirited. Mao Mao, you wait for me here. I'll follow and take a look, lest your Nian Bing brother's subordinates accidentally harm your pets due to their ignorance.\" His black figure sprang up, and Mao Mao was astonished to see Xiu Lu flash and catch up to the fox's side. Dandan, meanwhile, let out angry roars as it followed them up the mountain.\n\nRiding on Oscar's back, although the little dragon king flew extremely fast, Nian Bing felt very stable. Even the strong wind caused by the rapid flight was blocked by the gray airflow emitted by Oscar, causing no discomfort to his body. The person and the dragon were connected in mind, and without Nian Bing's deliberate command, Oscar knew where to fly. At his speed, it would take at most two days to cross this thousand-mile distance and reach Nian Bing's destination. Since leaving the snow mountain, Nian Bing had begun his cultivation on Oscar's back. Facing great changes, he would not miss any opportunity to cultivate.\n\nIn the dim room, Xie Yue opened the window. He didn't turn on the lights, supporting himself with both hands on the windowsill, and looked up at the silent night sky. The night was exceptionally clear today, with not a single trace of dark clouds. The crescent moon, showing half of its curved face, was exceptionally beautiful against the backdrop of the surrounding varying starlight. Its soft white light brought a touch of vitality to the earth.\n\n\"It seems tomorrow will be a sunny day,\" Xie Yue muttered to himself.\n\n\"Lord Xie, what are you thinking about?\" A charming voice sounded from behind Xie Yue. A pair of fair arms, devoid of any blood color, wrapped around Xie Yue's shoulders. A seductive body pressed against his back.\n\nXie Yue patted the small hand embracing him. \"What else could I be thinking about? A thousand years of effort, and my dream is about to come true. How can I not think about it?\"\n\nThe Vampire Queen Saina leaned against Xie Yue's cold, unfeeling body and whispered, \"Yue, do we really have to do this this time?\"\n\nXie Yue grabbed Saina's hand and suddenly turned around. \"What, you're reluctant? I only know that she must become the sacrifice. As for what she will eventually become, I don't know. She is my daughter too. Do you think I don't feel pain? However, a thousand years have passed, and with a bit of luck, today's situation has come about. I've thought about this for too long. Daughters can be reborn. But my wish may only have this one chance.\"\n\nSaina was silent for a moment. She lowered her head, not meeting Xie Yue's glowing green eyes. After a long time, she said somewhat reluctantly, \"Yue, it's not just for Youyou, but also for us. The Seven Dragon Kings are not fools. They have been looking for us. If they really come at that time, I'm afraid we won't be able to resist them! Yue, you are the most outstanding genius in our dark world for a thousand years. We finally obtained the Seal Bottle of Moordas, and not a single mistake can be made.\"\n\nXie Yue released Saina's hand. \"I understand what you're saying, but no matter what we face this time, no one can stop me from doing this. Saina, your vision is not far-reaching enough. I'm afraid what we are about to face is no longer just the Seven Dragon Kings. It seems we need to bring out all our preparations from the past years. We don't seek merit, only to delay enough time. When I become the master of the Lost Continent, nothing can be changed. After so many years of hard work, I absolutely cannot let this opportunity slip away, no matter the cost. I must succeed.\"\n\nSaina's body trembled. \"Yue, you mean...\"\n\nXie Yue nodded. \"I can't worry about that much anymore. I must do this. As long as we succeed, even if we become public enemies of the Radiant Continent, so what? I've already sent people to prepare. Now, no one can stop my resolve. Saina, you are my wife. I hope you will assist me with all your might.\"\n\nSaina sighed softly. \"No matter what you decide, I will help you with all my might. Since the day I followed you, everything of mine has belonged to you.\"\n\nThe green light in Xie Yue's eyes softened slightly. He embraced Saina. \"Alright, don't be sad. Youyou might not be in any danger.\"\n\n\"Report,\" a deep voice came from outside the room.\n\nSaina left Xie Yue's embrace and quietly disappeared into the darkness. Xie Yue said calmly, \"Come in.\"\n\nA sturdy black figure pushed the door open and knelt on one knee, respectfully saying, \"Lord Xie.\"\n\nXie Yue nodded. \"Ping Chao, how are the preparations for what I asked you to do?\"\n\nPing Chao looked up at Xie Yue. \"Everything is ready. You can start at any time.\"\n\nThe light in Xie Yue's eyes flared. \"Good, you've done well this time. I will reward you handsomely in the future. Go, take Youyou to the Underworld Cave first. It's time to start the arrangements.\"\n\nPing Chao respectfully agreed and turned to leave. The green light in Xie Yue's eyes turned an evil red, with cold light flashing continuously. \"Saina, we are about to begin.\"\n\nPing Chao left Xie Yue's room. His body trembled slightly. He looked up, and a struggle appeared on his pale and handsome face. Suddenly, as if he had made a decision, he quickened his pace outwards. The vampire count-level skin allowed him to quickly reach his destination. From a distance, he already saw the slender figure.\n\nYouyou was squatting on the ground, using a small twig to tease two crickets in a round box. \"Go, General! You're so stupid! Careful, careful, it's biting your leg.\"\n\n\"Youyou,\" Ping Chao stood behind Youyou, a trace of tenderness in his eyes, but his fists were clenched tightly.\n\nYouyou looked up and saw the gentle light in Ping Chao's eyes. She giggled and said, \"Brother Ping Chao, you've come at the right time. Look, my General is so powerful! Ah! You didn't call me by the wrong name today. Good, you deserve a reward. Brother Ping Chao, what do you want me to reward you with?\"\n\nPing Chao sighed and walked to Youyou's side, squatting down as well. He said in a low voice, \"Then reward me by listening to me say something.\"\n\nYouyou was taken aback. \"Brother Ping Chao, you're usually very quiet. What's wrong today? Say what you want to say.\" Since she was born, Ping Chao had been like this. From childhood to adulthood, everything about her had been taken care of by Ping Chao. To her, Ping Chao was like a brother and a father, much more affectionate than her own parents. Although he didn't talk much, his concern for her was exceptionally genuine. Therefore, if Youyou were to say who her most important person was, it would definitely be Ping Chao.\n\nPing Chao took a deep breath, calming his turbulent emotions, and said in a low voice, \"Youyou, I'll take you away. We'll go far, to a place no one can find, okay?\"\n\nYouyou blinked her big eyes at Ping Chao and chuckled, somewhat teasingly, \"Brother Ping Chao, aren't you trying to elope with me? Aren't you afraid my father will kill you?\"\n\nUsually, when Youyou teased Ping Chao, he would blush easily. However, today, his expression remained unchanged, still so pale. \"Youyou, I'm not joking. Come with me.\"\n\nYouyou frowned slightly. \"Why?\"\n\nPing Chao took a deep breath. \"Youyou, you've called me brother for so many years. Do you trust me?\"\n\nYouyou nodded. \"Of course I trust you, Brother Ping Chao. What's wrong with you today? It's so strange! I've never seen you like this before.\"\n\nPing Chao sighed softly. \"If you trust me, then come with me. I won't harm you. Don't ask too many questions, okay? There are some things I don't want you to know.\"\n\nYouyou stood up, pouting. \"No, if you don't explain clearly, how can I go with you? You know my father's temper. If I run away with you privately, won't he kill you?\"\n\nPing Chao anxiously said, \"I want to take you away precisely because I'm afraid of your father!\" As soon as he said it, he realized he had let it slip.\n\nYouyou's expression changed slightly. She grabbed Ping Chao's sleeve and said, \"Brother Ping Chao, tell me quickly, what exactly is going on? What happened to my father? What is he going to do?\"\n\nPing Chao sighed inwardly, knowing he couldn't hide it anymore. He understood Youyou's temper too well. If he didn't explain things clearly, she wouldn't go with him. He stood beside her and said, \"Youyou, Lord Xie should have told you about the summoning of the Seal Bottle of Moordas. Do you know that this summoning requires the Dark Saintess as a sacrifice, and the seal can only be unsealed under special conditions.\"",

    "content": "Yōuyōu was a very intelligent girl. Though Pingchao spoke vaguely, she immediately understood. Her expression changed slightly as she said, \"Brother Pingchao, are you saying I'm that Dark Saintess? No, that's impossible. How could Father use me as a sacrifice? You must be lying to me, right?\" She shook Pingchao's hand forcefully, but her face had already turned somewhat pale.\n\nPingchao sighed deeply and said, \"Yōuyōu, I am a vampire. From the day my vampire body awakened, I have followed Lady Sina, your mother. With Lady Sina's help, I've been able to continuously advance and reach my current level. Lord Xiexu is Lady Sina's husband and the ruler of our Dark World. We all belong to the darkness. I've grown weary of this Dark World. You should understand that for us in darkness, it's not just about freedom. Our principle has always been to stop at nothing to achieve our goals. Lord Xiexu has been preparing for hundreds of years to unseal the Bottle of Mo'audas. At this time, who can stop his will? Yōuyōu, I know you will be very sad to hear this, but I have no choice but to tell you. When Lord Xiexu decided to have you, his daughter, it was with a purpose. You grew up under Lord Xiexu's upbringing, and under his deliberate cultivation, you became the Saintess Body of our Dark World. Lord Xiexu's goal is for the upcoming moment. Yōuyōu, I can't bear it, I can't bear to see you like this... Come with me. As long as I have a breath left in me, I will always protect you. Yōuyōu, I only wish to stay by your side forever, to always be your Brother Pingchao. I don't want you to get hurt in the slightest! If I could exchange my life for yours, I would willingly do so. You are seventeen years old now. For seventeen years, I have hardly left your side for a single day. Seventeen years, watching you grow into a graceful young lady. Although I am also a member of the darkness, I absolutely refuse to see you harmed! Believe me, I am not lying to you. I am willing to swear on my life and soul.\"\n\nYōuyōu was completely stunned, looking into Pingchao's sincere eyes. She knew in her heart that everything Pingchao said was true. In her opinion, Pingchao didn't seem like someone from the Dark World. He had never lied to her since she was little. Why? Why did her father want to make her a sacrifice? Was his decision to have her born also with a purpose? Even though she knew this was the truth, she couldn't accept it in her heart. Yōuyōu's originally rosy cheeks turned even paler, and two faint green lights gradually lit up in her dark eyes. Traces of an evil aura emanated from her body. Her heart was so cold, so cold.\n\n\"Yōuyōu, what's wrong? Don't scare me, okay?\" Pingchao looked at Yōuyōu with concern. In his eyes, Yōuyōu had always been a happy little girl. He had never seen her like this before.\n\nYōuyōu shook her head and smiled sadly. \"Brother Pingchao, do you think I can leave? Don't you know Father's style? When he decides to do something, he considers everything that might happen. I am his daughter, his blood flows through me. No matter where I run, he can find my presence. I cannot leave. Running away is useless.\"\n\nPingchao said anxiously, \"Then are you willing to be the sacrifice to break the seal? Yōuyōu, now we can only try. Come with me, let's go as far as possible.\"\n\nYōuyōu continued to shake her head. \"Thank you, Brother Pingchao. You know what? In Yōuyōu's heart, you are always the most important. I'm really happy that you could say these things to Yōuyōu today. Actually, I know that all of Father's subordinates, including you, have been cursed by him. If you take me to escape, Father only needs a spell to plunge you into eternal damnation. You are sacrificing your own life for mine! How could Yōuyōu do that? Brother Pingchao, do I look good today?\"\n\nPingchao was stunned for a moment. The Yōuyōu before him was wearing a dark green long dress. Although she wasn't very tall, her delicate figure was so captivating. Even though her eyes were filled with sadness, it couldn't hide her stunning beauty. Having inherited the appearance of the Vampire Queen Sina, she was naturally beautiful, so movingly beautiful. Pingchao suddenly realized that the seventeen-year-old Yōuyōu was no longer a little girl. She had grown up. The faint green light flashing in her eyes made Pingchao, a vampire count, feel a pang of melancholy. He nodded firmly and said, \"Yes, you are very beautiful.\"\n\nYōuyōu took Pingchao's big hand and said, \"Thank you, Brother Pingchao. You don't need to say anything more. Since Father has decided to do this to me, I have no other choice. Brother Pingchao, I know you like Yōuyōu, and Yōuyōu likes you too. Although I usually bully you, in Yōuyōu's heart, you are the most important. I cannot go with you. I am willing to accept my fate.\"\n\nPingchao's whole body trembled. He tightly grasped Yōuyōu's hand, his body shaking slightly with excitement. \"No, Yōuyōu, you must come with me! Even if I have to force you, I will take you away!\"\n\nYōuyōu let Pingchao hold her hand and said sadly, \"It's useless. Whatever we do, it will only be futile. Why bother? Brother Pingchao, no matter what happens, Yōuyōu hopes you can live well. You are a good person, you shouldn't belong to the darkness. Before the ritual to unseal begins, I will definitely make Father lift your curse and let you leave here.\"\n\nJust as Pingchao was about to say something else, a low, cold voice suddenly sounded, \"Yes, whatever you do is futile. Pingchao. How dare you. It seems my judgment was not wrong.\"\n\nA dark aura instantly permeated the small courtyard. The moonlight and starlight in the sky dimmed completely at this moment. An evil aura enveloped everything around. A black figure slowly walked over, as if appearing out of thin air. His handsome, wicked face showed no expression, but his red, evil eyes were filled with a malevolent aura.\n\n\"Lord Xiexu.\" Pingchao was greatly alarmed and quickly let go of Yōuyōu's hand. The pressure accumulated over many years caused him to instinctively bow. Facing Xie Yue, he couldn't even muster a thought of resistance. Yōuyōu stepped forward, blocking Pingchao, and looked coldly at her father without a word. Even if Xie Yue's heart was hard, under his daughter's intense gaze, the killing intent in his eyes couldn't help but disappear. He sighed lightly and said, \"Yōuyōu, you know everything. Actually, you would have found out sooner or later. Pingchao has taken care of you for many years, and I expected him to tell you these things today.\"\n\nYōuyōu calmly asked, \"Father, I just want you to tell me yourself. When you and Mother had me, was it to break the seal on the Bottle of Mo'audas?\"\n\nXie Yue was startled, but he did not deny it. He nodded and said, \"That's right. Everything Pingchao just told you is true. When I decided to have you, my daughter, it was to break the seal on the Bottle of Mo'audas. Yōuyōu, perhaps all of this is too cruel for you. However, no matter what you think, I must do this. I have waited for this day for far too long. Father is sorry to you. Although it pains me to have to sacrifice you to break this seal, Father's heart is not at ease, but I have no choice.\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Yōuyōu interrupted Xie Yue. \"I understand, Father.\" She pronounced the word \"Father\" with particular clarity, which sounded so desolate in the night. A faint smile appeared on her face. Yōuyōu said, \"Since I was destined for that day from the moment I was born, how can I decide my own fate? My life was given to you, so returning it to you is nothing. Father, don't worry, I am willing to help you. No matter what you ask me to do, Yōuyōu will do as you say. I am your daughter, and I am also your tool. A tool should fulfill its responsibilities.\"\n\nXie Yue's entire body trembled. Even as the ruler of darkness, he was not without emotion. Looking at Yōuyōu's calm gaze and hearing her call him \"Father,\" Xie Yue hesitated for the first time. He doubted if his choice was correct. However, this hesitation only lasted for a moment. \"Yōuyōu, you are Father's only daughter, both now and in the future.\"\n\nThe smile on Yōuyōu's face twitched. \"Does that matter anymore? For me, it has no meaning. Father, you don't need to say more. I understand your meaning, and I will do what you ask. However, I hope you can grant me one condition, a not unreasonable condition.\"\n\nXie Yue nodded and looked at Pingchao, who was kneeling on the ground. \"Are you asking me to spare his life?\"\n\nYōuyōu replied, \"That's right, that's it. Father, if I'm not mistaken, offering the Dark Saintess as a sacrifice, if I cooperate with you and do exactly as you say, will make the ritual go more smoothly, right? If I resist, or if I have any intention of resisting, you might succeed, but it won't be as smooth. My request is simple: you cannot kill Brother Pingchao, and you must lift the curse on him. During the time before the ritual begins, I hope he can stay by my side. And when the ritual begins, please let him leave and never do anything against him, let him live his own life.\"\n\nXie Yue looked deeply at Yōuyōu and said calmly, \"You are indeed my daughter. Are you threatening me?\"\n\nYōuyōu met her father's gaze without yielding. \"You could say that. However, I believe you will agree. In the face of better interests, my father always knows how to choose.\"\n\nXie Yue nodded and said, \"Alright, I can agree to that, but don't forget your promise.\"\n\n\"No, Yōuyōu, you can't agree!\" Pingchao suddenly stood up, blocking Yōuyōu. He said sadly, \"Lord Xiexu, please spare Yōuyōu. She is your own daughter!\"\n\nXie Yue's eyes flashed with cold light. \"This is a father and daughter's conversation, what business is it of yours to interrupt? Get aside, or I might change my mind.\" With a casual wave of his hand, an invisible dark aura enveloped Pingchao's body, throwing him to the side.\n\nYōuyōu did not move, nor did she look at Pingchao who was thrown aside. \"Father, since I have promised, I will not go back on my word. Shall we swear with our souls?\"\n\nXie Yue frowned and looked at Yōuyōu. \"You don't trust me?\"\n\nYōuyōu said with a hint of disdain, \"Should I trust you? You once taught me that we are people of darkness, and human promises are the most boring things. Compared to promises, I believe your oath more. Only by swearing on one's soul does it have a binding effect on people of darkness. You taught me all this, have you forgotten?\"\n\nXie Yue nodded and said, \"Good, I promise you. Then let us swear together.\" In the darkness not far behind Xie Yue, tears were continuously streaming down Sina's face, but she did not stop any of this from happening, because she knew it was not something she could stop. Everything before her was what she least wanted to see, but she could only watch it unfold.\n\n...\n\nBoom, boom, boom, boom, boom... Muffled sounds continuously came from the summit of the snow mountain. It had been a full two days. The hundred experts from the Ice Moon Hall of the Blood Lion Sect continued their cultivation process in three shifts without interruption. For two days, they had exerted their full strength in this mountain-destroying operation. However, the snow mountain was truly too vast. When they saw Nian Bing casually unleash his Death Scythe, easily cutting off a tenth of the mountain, they already felt that this operation seemed less difficult than it looked. But when it came to doing it themselves, they deeply understood the gap in strength. After two full days, they had accomplished very little. The snow mountain, which was over nine hundred zhang high, had only lost one zhang in height in total after the continuous efforts of the three shifts. Moreover, the deeper they went into the mountain, the larger the volume became. Judging from the current situation, even if they all worked together like this, it would take ten years to destroy the snow mountain before them.\n\nMao Mao and Xīlǔ watched the busy figures on the snow mountain summit from afar, feeling a sense of admiration. Two days had passed. Although Nian Bing was not present, these people had not slacked off in the slightest. They had been working hard every day, using their Dou Qi without reservation. Although their combat power was constantly declining due to not eating, and they could only quench their thirst and hunger with ice and snow, they had not given up.",

    "content": "The unyielding spirit of their effort, however, earned even Xu Lu's silent admiration. Watching those people work in an orderly fashion, Xu Lu and Maomao had already distributed the extra dry rations they had brought. While it might not have helped much, it was better than nothing. Xu Lu had originally wanted to hunt some game for them, but he was stopped by Yin Dang. Yin Dang's reasoning was simple: when Nian Bing left, he had specifically instructed Yin Dang to be responsible for all logistical work. If their group ate anything else, it would be a violation of the Sect Leader's orders, and the members of the Blood Lion Sect would absolutely not do such a thing. Even the dry rations Xu Lu gave them, Yin Dang only distributed to a few of his subordinates who were weakest and struggling to hold on. Therefore, Xu Lu could only give up on the idea. He let them continue their efforts.\n\n\"Brother Xu Lu, it's been two days. Why hasn't Brother Nian Bing returned yet? Didn't he say he'd be back in two days? Where exactly did he go?\" Maomao looked around.\n\nXu Lu smiled and said, \"Your Brother Nian Bing has always been thoughtful. Since he said he'd be back in two days, he'll definitely be back today. I think he must have gone to prepare the logistics. He'll definitely bring back some food this time, after all, these people have been hungry for two days and have to expend a lot of energy every day. If this continues, there might not be many who can hold on.\"\n\nAs they were speaking, a red light emanated from the summit of the snow mountain. The light covered almost the entire summit, and in an instant, the sounds of Dou Qi's impact became more frequent. Rays of Dou Qi of various colors continuously exploded, as dazzling and beautiful as fireworks. Maomao laughed, \"It must be that guy again. He's really lazy, not doing anything himself, just constantly releasing his abilities.\"\n\nXu Lu said, \"This is already good. Without the help of you, this fox, your mountain-destroying operation would have become even more difficult. It's a pity we can't see it from below. Perhaps your cow is also providing them with considerable help up there. Fortunately, I didn't let your other pets go up with them, otherwise, their mountain-destroying operation would have been much easier.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Xu Lu's expression suddenly changed. His gaze became sharp, and he looked at a point not far from him. Maomao was talking face-to-face with Xu Lu. Seeing him suddenly stop and look to the side, and his aura becoming obviously sharper, she couldn't help but follow his gaze. The place Xu Lu was looking at was an open space; there was nothing there. Just as Maomao was wondering, the air in the place Xu Lu was looking at suddenly distorted slightly. Under Maomao's astonished gaze, a faint silver light lit up, and a silver door appeared out of thin air. The silver light rippled in a circular pattern. A tall figure stepped out from behind the door, a smile on his face, appearing before the two of them. Who else could this sudden appearance be but Nian Bing?\n\n\"Brother Nian Bing,\" Maomao pounced excitedly, grabbing Nian Bing's large hand and shaking it vigorously. \"Brother, you're finally back! Maomao missed you. Brother Xu Lu said you went to get food. What exactly did you bring back! Did you bring anything delicious for Maomao? Maomao hasn't been lazy these past two days, you know. I've been diligently practicing mental magic.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"It's good that you haven't been lazy. Of course, Brother brought back delicious things. Here, this is for you.\" With a flash of silver light in his hand, a large bag of food appeared out of thin air. Maomao snatched it and eagerly opened the bag, revealing all sorts of snacks, unique to Ice Moon City. Maomao jumped up excitedly and kissed Nian Bing on the cheek, \"Brother Nian Bing is the best!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and asked, \"Brother Xu Lu, have there been any incidents these past two days?\"\n\nXu Lu replied, \"Your subordinates have been working very hard. Where did you go? How did you return using spatial magic?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Only spatial magic could get me back in the shortest amount of time! This trip wasn't in vain. I've left a spatial coordinate there, so I won't need to fly for a long time when I go there again.\" It turned out that before he left, he had used magic to leave his spiritual imprint here for positioning. After reaching his destination and completing his tasks, he first used spatial magic to return to Ice Moon City, where he had left his positioning mark, bought some food for Maomao, and then rushed back here.\n\nXu Lu said, \"Your subordinates are starving. Hurry up and get them something to eat, otherwise, I don't think they have much combat strength left. Nian Bing, isn't it a bit too difficult to have them excavate this snow mountain? Even a Martial Saint realm expert, with a full-power attack, can only clear an area of a few yards around them in this hard snow mountain, not to mention their Dou Qi is limited.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"It's precisely because it's difficult that I'm having them do it, otherwise, it wouldn't have any effect. I'm having them carry out this mountain-destroying operation not only to enhance their strength but also to help them build confidence. Brother, just watch, it won't be long before the benefits of this mountain-destroying operation become apparent. It's time to get them something to eat.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a mass of earth-yellow light appeared in Nian Bing's hand and was injected into the ground beneath his feet. Under the control of his immense spiritual power, the ground began to vibrate slightly, and the earth rolled up, solidifying into a huge stove. With a flash of silver light, a large pot with a diameter of nearly ten feet appeared out of thin air, settling firmly into the stove. This large pot was specially ordered by Nian Bing to be made in Ice Moon City, and it was precisely because of the crafting of this pot that he was delayed for several hours. With a slight smile, a faint divine light appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. Ice elements condensed in the pot, and with the assistance of fire elements, a pot half-full of clear water appeared in a short while.\n\nMaomao was already happily eating her snacks nearby, watching Nian Bing's actions as she ate.\n\nSilver light appeared in Nian Bing's hand again, and several fist-sized, dark green objects fell into the pot. Xu Lu counted them roughly; there were dozens of them. Nian Bing's left hand flashed with firelight, and the stove immediately became hot. Under the intense heat of his fire magic, the pot half-full of clear water quickly began to boil. Flicking his fingers, several streams of colored wind elements floated into the pot, grinding the dark green objects into pieces. Instantly, the clear water in the pot turned into a pot of dark green liquid, and a pungent, fishy smell wafted out. Xu Lu frowned slightly and involuntarily stepped back a few paces.\n\nMaomao also smelled the fishy odor emanating from the pot and couldn't help but run to the side, saying, \"It smells so bad! Brother Nian Bing, what is this? The food you made before was always delicious.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"This time is different. I'm not making food for them to eat. Besides, they are not suitable for eating delicacies now. Excessive comfort and enjoyment will only numb their nerves due to relaxation. As the saying goes, 'Bitter medicine is good for illness.' It's not for you to drink anyway.\" The dark green liquid churned and boiled, and the pungent smell became even stronger.\n\nNian Bing looked up at the summit of the snow mountain. A flash of divine light appeared in his eyes, and he said, \"Yin Dang, order all members of this sect to gather here immediately. Everyone.\" His voice was not loud, but with the aid of spiritual power, it steadily reached the mountaintop a thousand feet away. Upon hearing Nian Bing's voice, Yin Dang, who was in the midst of training, immediately led his men down the mountain quickly. At the same time, he sent out a signal to call the disciples who were cultivating.\n\nIn a short while, all one hundred and one people appeared before Nian Bing. Nian Bing's gaze swept over them, and he saw that everyone, including Yin Dang, had somewhat pale faces, clearly due to exhaustion. It was indeed difficult for them to work hard to split the mountain in this icy and snowy environment.\n\nAll one hundred and one people saw the large pot in front of them and smelled the nauseating fishy odor in the pot. Although they stood with their backs straight, they couldn't hide the fatigue on their faces.\n\nThe flame in Nian Bing's hand had stopped, and the dark green liquid in the pot had also stopped boiling. With a flash of silver light in his hand, a ladle appeared. He walked up to Yin Dang and handed him the ladle, saying calmly, \"Starting with you, everyone drinks three ladles. No spitting. After drinking, sit here and cultivate immediately.\"\n\nYin Dang was stunned for a moment, looking at the large pot with some confusion, and subconsciously asked, \"Sect Leader, can that thing be eaten?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Do you think I'm giving you poison? Feng Yue Mobile Reading Network! I can tell you honestly, this thing tastes very bad, but you must drink it. Don't you want to drink it?\"\n\nYin Dang shook his head and said, \"Let alone just being unpalatable, even if it were truly poison, as long as the Sect Leader commands it, we would never disobey.\" As he spoke, he strode to the pot, scooped up a large ladleful of the dark green liquid, closed his eyes, and sent it into his mouth. Although he drank it resolutely, it was only then that he truly understood what Nian Bing meant by \"tastes very bad.\" It was the first time in his life he had ever tasted something so unpalatable. The taste was indescribable; even excrement and urine wouldn't be this awful.\n\nThe fishy smell was both sour and astringent. The most unbearable thing was its extreme bitterness. Having not eaten for two days, suddenly drinking such a fishy broth made Yin Dang's stomach churn, and his face instantly became even paler. His chest and abdomen heaved, and just as he was about to vomit, a gentle energy was injected into him from behind. A pure and comfortable light element was softly infused into every corner of his body, forcibly suppressing the churning liquid. Yin Dang's face turned red then white, and he finally managed to suppress the urge to vomit. Looking at the pot of foul-smelling liquid before him, he, a Martial Saint, couldn't help but show a trace of fear. Was this something humans could drink? What exactly had the Sect Leader brought? As he hesitated, Nian Bing's voice came from behind him, \"Quick, two more ladles.\"\n\nIf Yin Dang had been full of courage when drinking the first ladle, then now he truly lacked the courage to drink anymore. Turning around, he looked at Nian Bing, whose expression was calm, and said with a wry smile, \"Sect Leader, can I not drink it? This, this...\"\n\nNian Bing's expression was very calm, but his tone was exceptionally firm, \"No, you must drink it. This is an order. Are the disciples of our Blood Lion Sect, who are not even afraid of death, afraid of a pot of this soup?\"\n\nSoup? Could this be called soup? Yin Dang still hesitated, his mouth still filled with that bitter taste. His face changed several times, and finally, he scooped up the second ladleful. The foul-smelling liquid was sent into his mouth again. It was still sour, astringent, and bitter, an extremely unpleasant sensation. But when he swallowed the fishy broth for the second time, Yin Dang suddenly felt a cool sensation rising from his lower abdomen. The nausea that should have appeared did not recur. Although the bitter and astringent taste still made him grimace repeatedly, it was not as uncomfortable as when he drank the first ladle. Without any hesitation, since it was so unpalatable, rather than savoring the bitter taste bit by bit, it was better to do it all at once. He immediately scooped up another ladleful and swallowed it. After three ladles, he couldn't help but let out a long sigh. The cool energy within him also became exceptionally clear. Seeing Nian Bing's satisfied gaze, he nodded to his subordinates, and another Martial Saint came forward, taking the ladle from his hand. Since Yin Dang had set an example, no one could refuse to drink.\n\nJust as the second person was about to drink, Yin Dang suddenly felt the cool energy in his lower abdomen gradually become scorching hot, as if the burning sensation was about to incinerate his meridians. In surprise, he couldn't help but look at Nian Bing. Nian Bing stepped forward, placed a hand on Yin Dang's shoulder, and said, \"Go sit aside and cultivate in place. Everyone, remember, only by enduring hardships can one reach greatness. That's right, the taste of this pot of fishy broth is probably much worse than anything you've ever drunk before, but I demand that you must drink it. After experiencing the suffering of today, you will become stronger when you encounter anything in the future.\" As he spoke, he struck the back of the Martial Saint who had just drunk a ladleful and was about to vomit, forcing him to swallow it down.\n\nYin Dang had already moved to the side and sat on the ground to cultivate. The willpower of the second Martial Saint was not as strong as Yin Dang's. Under the pressure of Nian Bing's innate energy, he drank the first ladle, and he felt dizzy, the painful feeling in his stomach making him wish he were dead. He truly lacked the courage to drink any more. However, Nian Bing had no intention of letting him off. His Sky Eye domain, under the effect of his powerful spiritual power, directly restrained his body. Xu Lu, who had received a nod from Nian Bing, forcibly poured two more ladles into him, completing the task as if he were force-feeding a duck. Also feeling the cool airflow within his body, this Martial Saint felt as if he had walked through hell. When the Sky Eye domain was released and Xu Lu led him to the side, he felt as if his entire body was exhausted. He sat down heavily next to Yin Dang and immediately began to cultivate.",

    "content": "Nian Bing waved his hand, and the third person walked over. Drinking this bloody juice had little to do with strength; willpower and courage were more important. From the first Yin Dang to the last great swordsman, Nian Bing had been observing. Overall, the elites of Ice Moon Hall had good willpower, with none truly resisting. When the last person finished three dippers, there was very little of the bloody juice left in the pot. One hundred and one people sat around the area, faint鬥氣 (dou qi) light surrounding their bodies as they cultivated.\n\nXi Lu whispered, \"Nian Bing, you little brat, you're truly ruthless! Looking at them, this stuff must be incredibly hard to swallow, right?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"Brother Xi Lu, there's still a little left. Why don't you have some? If you haven't truly tasted it, you'll never know the real flavor.\"\n\nXi Lu repeatedly waved his hands. \"Forget it, I don't have a masochistic tendency. Why don't you drink it yourself? If you're willing to drink it, I'll join you for a couple of sips.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at his subordinates sitting around, a flash of light in his eyes. He didn't say anything. Grasping the edge of the pot with both hands, he lifted the nearly meter-wide pot, brought his mouth to the rim, tilted it, and began to drink large mouthfuls. He even drank seven or eight gulps. When he handed the iron pot to Xi Lu, his expression didn't change at all, as if it were just ordinary soup.\n\nXi Lu stared at Nian Bing, dumbfounded, trying to find a flaw in his expression. But he was disappointed. Nian Bing showed no change, still smiling at him.\n\nXi Lu gritted his teeth and, imitating Nian Bing, began to gulp it down. The moment the first mouthful of bloody juice entered his mouth, his body stiffened. But he didn't stop, and drank all the remaining bloody juice. While Nian Bing endured the churning in his chest and abdomen, he secretly praised Xi Lu's willpower, knowing it was incomparable to ordinary people, especially given his time spent on the Divine Continent.\n\nWith a bang, Xi Lu placed the iron pot on the stove, gasping for cold air. \"I, I'll be damned! Nian Bing, is this stuff meant for humans to drink?\"\n\nNian Bing laughed heartily. \"Not for humans to drink? At least all one hundred and three of us have drunk it. Let's call this 'Man's Soup.' Only true men dare to drink it.\"\n\nXi Lu glared at Nian Bing irritably. Suddenly, his expression changed from displeasure to surprise. He exclaimed, \"Nian Bing, what exactly is this stuff? It feels so comfortable.\" His strength was naturally incomparable to people like Yin Dang. Under the effect of his powerful internal dou qi, Xi Lu clearly felt a wave of heat nourishing his meridians. His entire body felt warm and incredibly comfortable, as if every muscle was filled with strength. Even the speed of his dou qi circulation became faster as his blood flowed. It was known that Xi Lu had cultivated for many years on the Divine Continent, and even spiritual medicine had little effect on him. Yet, after drinking the bloody juice in the pot, he immediately felt its nourishing effects, greatly astonishing Xi Lu. Only then did he understand how good Nian Bing was to his subordinates. Something that could produce such an effect was naturally extraordinary. Nian Bing had managed to acquire so much of it. Although the taste was terrible, its effects were immense.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"I've eaten this stuff a long time ago. It's because of its effects that my body became much tougher than that of ordinary mages.\" The dozens of dark green objects he brought back were actually the iron-thread snake gallbladders that the Fire Dragon King Galadris had given him. The iron-thread snake was a unique creature in the Heavenly Pendulum Mountain Range, tough all over, immensely powerful, and possessing a potent poison. Its gallbladders were absolutely nourishing treasures. Nian Bing had eaten many with Galadris's help, and even his body, which had never cultivated dou qi, had become exceptionally resilient. The day before yesterday, after leaving this place, Nian Bing's destination was the Heavenly Pendulum Mountain Range, where he had hunted dozens of iron-thread snakes and brought back the precious prey. Because of the presence of the Fire Dragon humanoids and Galadris's former lair, few people ventured into the Heavenly Pendulum Mountain Range. As a powerful species, iron-thread snakes had reproduced prolifically at that time. Therefore, even though Nian Bing had no experience catching snakes, he quickly brought them back.\n\nXi Lu gave Nian Bing a thumbs-up. \"Good stuff, it really does feel good to drink! Just as you said, good medicine tastes bitter but benefits health. If there's more next time, I'll have some more.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Brother, with your physique, drinking this won't have much of an effect. However, for our subordinates, the effects are excellent! Alright, the bitter part is done, it's time to get something to eat for them. Otherwise, when they wake up from their cultivation, they'll definitely say their leader is unkind.\" As he spoke, silver light flashed in his hands, and several thick iron-thread snake carcasses appeared out of thin air.\n\nMao Mao was excitedly eating her delicious snacks. She hadn't even paid attention when Yin Dang and the others drank the bloody juice. Suddenly seeing so many snake carcasses, out of her feminine nature, she let out a scream and quickly hid behind Xi Lu. A faint fluctuation appeared in the air. Including Nana the fox and Dandan the cow, who had been on the mountaintop earlier, all five of her pets appeared almost simultaneously. They looked around as if facing a great enemy. Mao Mao's mental power had reached a very high level; when she encountered danger, her pets would automatically appear to protect their master.\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Mao Mao, don't be afraid, these are dead. Look, your fox knows what's good!\" As he spoke, he looked at his five pets, who had advanced to the fifth rank, with surprise. The formidable aura of these five large creatures seemed no less than the magical beasts he had brought back from the Divine Continent. Although their attack power might not be superior to those magical beasts, based on their aura and energy fluctuations, these five pets seemed to have a special coordination. Just like now, when Nana the fox, as if seeing a beautiful female fox, rushed towards the pile of iron-thread snake carcasses, Sweetie the dark magic rat's aura became unusually sharp, and Dandan the cow stood upright, revealing its eight golden udders. Pink Piggy Guan Guan also stepped forward a few paces, its large ears spread to its sides, seemingly ready to pounce at any moment. Strongy the cockroach was behind the other pets, but unstable energy fluctuations appeared around its body.\n\nNana the fox was not polite at all. She grabbed a smaller iron-thread snake in her mouth and ran back. Her front claws were very sharp. Even the tough skin of the iron-thread snake was easily peeled open under her claws. She opened her foxy mouth, her lecherous eyes filled with a bit more greed, and began to eat the snake meat in large mouthfuls. The gallbladders of the iron-thread snake were naturally the best treasure, but these gallbladders also had excellent nourishing effects.\n\nNian Bing's eyes sparkled with brilliance. Seven Shadow Puppets appeared simultaneously. The light from seven divine blades brought a misty aura to the flat ground. Under Nian Bing's mental power, the seven Shadow Puppets moved together, pouncing towards the pile of iron-thread snake carcasses. Seven-colored lights flashed simultaneously, and under Nian Bing's mental guidance, they began their work.\n\nYin Dang gradually awoke from his cultivation, feeling warm all over and incomparably comfortable. His internal blood and qi were in perfect harmony. The cold and hunger of the past two days seemed to have completely disappeared at this moment. His spirit was even better than when he first arrived at the snowy mountains. Huh? What's that smell? Yin Dang, who had just awakened, hadn't even opened his eyes yet, but he inhaled deeply. It smelled so good!\n\nOne hundred and one elites of Ice Moon Hall awoke one after another. They saw dozens of huge wooden racks, each with a strange large strip of meat threaded onto it. Nian Bing stood not far away, emitting dozens of streams of green light from his hands, wrapping around the wooden racks and rotating slowly. Behind each wooden rack, a mass of red flame burned. Strangely, these flames were not caused by anything burning; it was as if the air itself was their fuel. The waves of rich aroma were emanating from this roasted meat.\n\n\"Sect Master.\" Yin Dang walked to Nian Bing's side and respectfully called out. Even the dullest person could now understand that the bloody juice they had drunk earlier was definitely a good thing. At the very least, it had dispelled their fatigue. Although they had only cultivated for less than an hour, the effect was surprisingly good. The comfort they felt throughout their bodies greatly increased the confidence of these Ice Moon Hall elites in Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"The bloody juice probably didn't taste good. You'll be compensated soon. This roasted meat is naturally juicy and doesn't need oil. I didn't have time to buy more seasonings, but the meat itself is tender and fatty. As long as the heat is controlled well, simply sprinkling some salt will make it quite delicious. There are too many of you, so please bear with it.\" Although his magical cultivation was profound, preparing food for over a hundred people alone was indeed difficult, so he could only use wind magic to assist in roasting the meat. And these meat strips before them were the skinless meat of the iron-thread snakes processed by the Seven Shadow Puppets. Dozens of iron-thread snakes of various sizes, but the meat from these snakes would be enough for over a hundred people to eat for three to five days. Smelling the overwhelming aroma, the warriors who hadn't eaten for two days widened their eyes one by one.\n\nIt had taken Nian Bing quite some effort to handle the venom in the iron-thread snakes' fangs and thoroughly clean their bodies earlier, otherwise, they wouldn't have been roasting for so long. Seeing the eager looks on his subordinates' faces, Nian Bing couldn't help but smile. \"Eager to eat? Take the salt and sprinkle it evenly on the meat. You can eat it soon.\" With a wave of his hand, dozens of salt shakers appeared out of thin air. Among seasonings, if there was anything most important, it was undoubtedly salt. Other seasonings would change the taste of food, but salt was indispensable. Salt is the essence of all flavors. In the eyes of ordinary people, salt might be the most common and unexceptional seasoning, but without salt, even Nian Bing could not create perfect food.\n\n\"Brother Nian Bing, you're so mean.\" Mao Mao tugged at Nian Bing's sleeve with dissatisfaction. Fortunately, Nian Bing's mental power was strong enough, otherwise, if she pulled like that, the roasted meat would have lost control. Nian Bing asked in surprise, \"Mao Mao, what's wrong? Is Brother Nian Bing upsetting you?\" Ever since he returned, Mao Mao had been eating non-stop! Why was she still blaming him?\n\nMao Mao pouted. \"Of course, you're mean! You bullied me. If you had told me earlier that you could roast meat, Mao Mao wouldn't have eaten so many snacks just now, and I wouldn't be too full to eat much roasted meat now. You compensate me.\"\n\nNian Bing couldn't help but smile and tease. \"I thought it was for something else. So that's it! Brother Nian Bing didn't do it on purpose. You didn't ask me if I could cook, did you? Just eat a little less later. We'll be staying here for another two months, and I'll make sure you eat to your heart's content. However, Mao Mao, don't eat too much, or you'll become a little fat cat.\"\n\nMao Mao stuck out her tongue at Nian Bing, dissatisfied. \"You're the little fat cat! My figure is great, I won't get fat at all. Besides, it's so cold here, how can I not eat more to increase my body heat?\"\n\nThe snake meat was finally roasted. As soon as Nian Bing said \"Let's eat,\" the one hundred and one warriors, including Yin Dang, pounced like wolves and tigers. At this moment, the concept of status seemed unimportant. Yin Dang was slightly slower, and he saw a piece of snake meat he had reached for being snatched away by his subordinate. However, although these warriors were eating with red eyes, they still left the largest roasted snake for Nian Bing and the two others. They understood this rule. Xi Lu was not polite either, laughing heartily as he tore pieces of meat from the roasted snake and ate. Mao Mao's speed was no slower than his, and her eating habits were even more ferocious than Xi Lu's. She didn't look like she had just said she had no room to eat. Although her pets were very tempted, with Mao Mao there, they could only watch with longing eyes. Soon, Mao Mao showed Nian Bing what continuous combat ability meant. Although her eating speed was far inferior to Xi Lu's, from the moment Xi Lu started eating until he was full, she was still eating continuously. She had already gotten a small knife from Xi Lu and ate skillfully, specifically picking the crispy parts. Although her hands and face were covered in oil, she ate with great enjoyment, showing no signs of stopping. Nian Bing was also eating with them, but he couldn't match their speed. As he ate, he couldn't help but think of Phoenix Girl. If Phoenix Girl were here, she would probably eat even more.\n\nThe iron-thread snake grew in the Heavenly Pendulum Mountain Range. The snake meat was tender and fatty. When roasted, it had a special aroma that made one linger. Although Nian Bing only added salt, it highlighted the natural aroma of the iron-thread snake. The delicious roasted meat made every warrior of Ice Moon Hall feel like they were eating unprecedented delicacies.",

    "content": "這或許是與他們先前喝過的鐵線蛇膽熬製的苦湯有關，畢竟，對比實在太懸殊了。在興奮中，這一頓飯足足吃了半個時辰，雖然武士們都像餓狼，但鐵線蛇的數量畢竟太多了，最小的一條也有丈余長，到最後，他們只吃掉了大約五分之一的蛇肉，剩下的，不用念冰說，都被儲藏進了冰川上那些早已開鑿好的冰洞之中。而念冰他們吃的這一條是最大的，也耗費了念冰最多的火魔法力，當念冰、貓貓和舄鹵都吃飽後，長達三丈余的鐵線蛇烤肉還有絕大部分，貓貓隨手一招呼，她那五隻寶貝寵物立刻沖了上去，速度最快的自然是猥瑣的狐狸，其他幾隻寵物較慢，誰說牛隻吃草，貓貓這隻「爆奶金牛」¹吃起肉來絲毫不比別的寵物差，五隻寵物中，以菊花豬「官官」和暗魔鼠「甜甜」的戰鬥力最強，仗著身高體壯，佔據了最好的位置，連蛇骨頭都不放過。最可憐的就是幻影魔蟑「強強」，它先天有缺陷，嘴比其他四隻寵物都要小得多，雖然身材並不小，但吃起來的速度卻要慢得多。\n\n銀碭和屬下們儲存好蛇肉後，排列整齊的隊伍站在念冰面前等候命令，念冰抬頭看了一眼那似乎並沒有太大變化的雪山，淡然道：「你們體力應該也恢復了，肚子也吃飽了，該是繼續完成滅山行動的時候，不要以為我給你們的是一個不可能完成的任務，只要繼續努力下去，你們就會看到奇蹟發生。好了，現在你們就去吧，從明天開始，恢復三撥輪流滅山的順序。」\n\n「是，教主。」吃飽了肚子，這些武士們一個個都有了底氣，在銀碭的帶領下朝雪山山頂而去，看著他們的背影，念冰不禁露出一絲笑容，很快，你們就會感覺到不同了。看著武士們都登山而去，他自己找了個地方盤膝坐下，靜靜的修煉。七彩光暈形成一層保護罩，抵禦著寒風。\n\n正如念冰所想，當滅山行動再次展開後，銀碭他們頓時感覺到了不同，以往他們全力攻擊六、七次後，就需要休息一會兒，但這一次，連續戰鬥十次後，依舊生龍活虎，而且，他們驚訝地發現，自己的力量似乎增強了很多。鬥氣轟擊山體，威力比原先有了顯著的增強，一開始這些武士們還沒有太在意，但當一天下來，雪山整體被炸掉三丈後，他們頓時意識到了自己身體的變化。他們都想到了同樣的問題，腥汁，只有那腥汁是最可疑的，不論是銀碭，還是他的屬下們，都不禁對念冰這位年輕的教主暗暗感激。要知道，一名武士想增強自身實力只有不斷的修煉和實戰，但跟隨念冰來到這片冰天雪地之中，短短數天的時間，他們的實力卻都有了不同程度的增強。原本對滅山行動沒有絲毫信心的他們，已經開始期待著兩個月後訓練結束時自己的情況了。積極性的提高頓時使他們的效率增強起來。\n\n七天後，當停滯在冰月堂小隊進入這片山脈的第十天，太陽剛剛升起之時，一隻雪鷹從冰月城的方向飛來。雪鷹是冰月帝國特有的一種鷹，生性兇猛，只生活在寒冷地區。一旦馴服後，就會成為主人最好的夥伴，這隻雪鷹可以說是銀碭的寶貝。當他看了雪鷹帶來的信後，立刻就從山頂處下來找到念冰。\n\n「教主，血衛已經到了。」聽著銀碭的回答，念冰精神一振，滿意道：「好快啊！」\n\n銀碭微笑道：「教主的吩咐當然快了。七位長老一接到您的命令，就讓五百血衛日夜兼程趕到了冰月城，現在他們正在我的冰月堂總部待命。您看，是不是讓他們現在就過來呢？」銀碭眼中閃爍著淡淡的精華，十天過去了，念冰一共離開了三次，他們也喝了三次腥汁。自從知道了那腥汁奇妙的作用後，再沒有人抱怨，每當看到那一鍋腥臭的汁液時，他們彷彿看到了天下至寶一般，腥汁的味道似乎也不那麼難喝了。十天的時間，他們成長的速度幾乎是以前難以想像的，尤其是自身的體力和鬥氣純度，在不斷的劈山過程中，都得到了極大的提高，又有鐵線蛇和蛇肉的滋補，這些武士們的信心越來越足，從滅山行動開始到現在，整座山除了念冰開始時砍掉的百丈外，他們已經成功的滅掉了二十丈，雖然山體越來越粗大，但是他們卻依舊保持著一定的速度，這就證明了他們的實力在不斷的提升過程中。\n\n念冰微微一笑，搖了搖頭，道：「不用了，我去一趟冰月城帶他們過來吧，正好也看一下我要的東西那邊準備得如何了。銀碭，這邊就交給你指揮，最遲今天晚上我也能趕回來。」不知道冰月城那邊怎麼樣了，自己要的東西「燕風」¹準備了多少。那些才是關鍵啊！畢竟，這些武士再練，也不可能在短短兩個月的時間內能與神人抗衡，這就需要自己設計的那種東西，如果能夠成功的話，雖然只有自己和舄鹵二人，也足夠了。\n\n銀碭道：「教主放心，最近弟兄們越來越有信心了，根本不用刻意叮囑，一個個乾的都賣力氣了。坦白說，從我開始修煉武技到現在，這十天來，是我進步速度最快的十天，教主，謝謝您把這個機會給了我們冰月堂。您儘管放心，我們冰月堂的兄弟一定會盡全力完成任務。」\n\n念冰微微一笑，道：「平時多流汗，戰時少流血。兩個月後將要面對什麼我已經說過，銀堂主，為了兄弟們的生命，你們要更加努力才行。」\n\n念冰把舄鹵留在這裡，帶著貓貓憑藉空間魔法回冰月城去了。在這裡待了十天，也難為貓貓能夠每天塌實的修煉她的精神魔法，這次冰月城，也可以讓她放鬆一下。念冰去的時間並不很長。從清晨到傍晚，當天剛剛擦黑之時，他就已經和貓貓回來了。\n\n銀色的大門在空中閃亮，貓貓第一個跳了出來，緊接著是念冰，舄鹵微笑著迎了上來，他剛要說話，卻看到一個個暗紅色的身影魚貫而出，他們沒有發出任何聲音。這些人剛一出現，舄鹵頓時一驚，因為他從這些人身上感受到了一股凜冽的氣息，雖然殺氣完全內斂，但這些全身暗紅色武士服，身背細劍的武士們，卻給他留下了很深刻的印象。這些人看起來都是三十歲左右，一個個臉上沒有任何表情，出現後，一個個都平靜地站在念冰身後，排成整齊的隊列。從他們身上，舄鹵感受到了血腥的氣息，那股強大的殺機隨著人數的增加不斷升騰著。他們每一個人，都像一柄即將出鞘的利劍一般，似乎隨時都有可能發動最強的攻擊，他們的眼神雖然平靜，但他們的目光卻像毒蛇一般。冰月堂的武士們已經讓舄鹵覺得素質很高，但和這些人身上散發的氣息相比，卻有著不小的差距。看著他們寬厚的手掌，差不多的身材，以及那冰冷的氣質，舄鹵不禁倒吸一口涼氣，這是仰光大陸的人麼？從他們身上散發的氣息來看顯然是經過長時間訓練的，而且，他們絕不是普通的武士，他們的實力，明顯是用鮮血鍛鍊而來。殺手，這是舄鹵最後的判斷。舄鹵的猜測並沒有錯。五百血衛，作為血獅教最精銳的成員，他們平時的作用，就是攻堅，一旦血獅教遇到什麼難以解決的問題或者危機之時，就是他們出去的時候。這五百血衛耗費了血獅教大量的資源，就連原來的五堂，任何一堂的消耗的資源也不如他們來得多。血衛的培養是從小朝廷的，由血獅教中地位最高的血獅堂派遣高手，在民間尋找資質優秀的孤兒，從三歲起開始培養，他們心中灌輸的信息只有服從和殺戮，每一個血獅堂中的血衛，他們開始為血獅堂服役是三十歲，也是人類一生中身體最完美的一個時期，從三十歲到四十五歲，十五年的時間是他們為血獅教服務的時間，過了四十五歲的血衛，會立刻離開血衛的隊伍，由血獅教安排，成為一個普通人，而退役的血衛，在血獅教的地位極高，他們有的擔任下任血衛的教官，有的則到各堂擔任重要職務，無一例外的都會獲得最好的待遇。但是，從血衛這個編制出現之後，最後能夠成功退役的十不足一，可見他們執行的任務有多麼困難了。也正是因為如此，經受過鮮血考驗的他們，是黑暗世界中最強的隊伍。雖然人數只有五百，但當初連念冰的爺爺「融焰」²在擁有了火焰魔龍騎士團¹時，都曾經說過，在現階段，唯一能夠將火焰魔龍騎士團毀滅的，就只有這五百人了。並不是說這些血衛能夠從下面與火焰魔龍騎士團對抗。但是，血衛們受過的訓練，卻始終灌輸給他們一種思想，那就是為了達到目的不擇手段，單是這一點，就算兩個火焰魔龍騎士團，也未必是他們的對手。\n\n看著舄鹵驚訝的目光，念冰微笑道：「大哥，這些就是我們血獅教精銳中的精銳，血獅五百血衛。當初，我幫助燕風登上冰月帝國皇位，最關鍵的皇宮一戰，就是由他們完成的，那時雖然我運用各種形式使皇宮內部空虛，但這五百血衛卻做到了不死一人的奇蹟。」\n\n舄鹵點了點頭道：「不錯，這些人不光是實力強，更重要的是他們身上散發出的那種氣息，連我都有些恐懼的感覺了。念冰，你這個血獅教的勢力還真是強大啊！我看，如果不計犧牲的話，半神³以下的神人⁴，在五對一的情況下，恐怕也難在他們手上討好。」半神，就是指十二階以下的神人，所謂的半神，也就是實力凌駕於武聖⁵和神師⁶之間。舄鹵的判斷非常準確，這些血衛的實力雖然大都在大劍師⁷和武鬥家⁸之間，但是，他們卻完全可以做到狙擊武聖的任務。舄鹵暗暗計算了一下，神之大陸有上萬神人，但是，大部分是最低級的神人，素質甚至還不如眼前這些人。看來，仰光大陸除了頂級高手遠無法與神之大陸相比以外，還是有能夠與普通神人抗衡的力量。\n\n正在舄鹵觀察這五百血衛之時，後面的血衛已經逐漸走出，在隊伍的最後，舄鹵看到了一些奇怪的東西，最後出現的三十名血衛，每三人抬著一個由金屬製作而成的巨大架子，不知道是幹什麼用的，架子前端寬約一丈呈弧形，下面有一個直的圓柱，圓柱底部是圓錐形的尖銳，而圓柱兩旁，各向旁邊延伸出一個方形的支架，支架下面是用熟牛皮墊上的，前面兩名血衛正是用肩膀頂在那裡抬著架子，從最前端的弧形處，一個長達一丈的方形金屬柱向後延伸，而弧形兩端盡頭，則由一根黑色的金屬絲連接而成，金屬絲粗如拇指，看不出是什麼材料。矮人族¹⁰是鑄造的大師，當舄鹵看到這東西時，腦海中立刻開始了飛快的計算，尤其是當他看到那根金屬絲，以及中間那根方形的金屬柱一直向後延伸，以及後面那名血衛抬著的地方時，眼中不禁精光連閃，大叫一聲，「好，真是好東西。」迫不及待的幾步跑上前，就要去摸那巨大的金屬架。\n\n黑色的光芒如同毒蛇之牙一般恍然探出，一瞬間，至少有數十柄細劍指向舄鹵，舄鹵前衝的身體瞬間停止，一層黑色的鬥氣從體內瀰漫而出，他感覺到了危機，那十餘柄漆黑的細劍所指的地方都是他身上的要害，但卻沒有一處重複，強烈的殺機鎖定著自己的身體。\n\n---\n¹ 爆奶金牛 (Bào nǎi jīn niú): \"Bursting Milk Golden Ox\".

    "content": "In this moment, he clearly felt that no matter which direction he moved, these thin swords would immediately attack him. He certainly didn't fear such attacks, but the coordinated threat formed in this instant made his impression of these Blood Guards even deeper. Looking at those emotionless eyes, Xi Lu couldn't help but nod inwardly, \"Impressive, truly impressive.\"\n\nThis all happened in an instant. Nian Bing quickly said, \"Stop, they're our people.\" The black thin swords disappeared silently. The Blood Guards' formation remained just as orderly, their killing intent instantly withdrawn. Even a master like Xi Lu felt a lightness all over his body. It was only then that he could touch the metal frame. His hand, imbued with black fighting spirit, fumbled over the metal frame, especially the curved groove in the center of the black square pillar extending backward. Nian Bing nodded repeatedly, his eyes filled with praise. \"Good stuff, truly good stuff. I didn't expect this level of craftsmanship could be achieved on the Yangguang Continent.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"The Ice Moon Empire is the most skilled forging nation on the Yangguang Continent. Before we came to this mountain range, I spoke with Yan Feng, the King of the Ice Moon Empire, and specifically asked him to have people rush the production. They are still working intensely on the forging there, all the materials are in place, and I believe the items I need will all be completed soon. Two months should be enough.\"\n\nXi Lu didn't turn to look at Nian Bing; his gaze was completely captivated by what was before him. As he touched the cold metal, he murmured, \"Requires two people to carry, the frame can be raised and lowered to accommodate differences in height. This is an alloy. Not simple iron, but a fusion of repeatedly forged fine iron and tungsten steel, possessing excellent strength. And it's made of nearly a hundred strands twisted together, the craftsmanship is already very refined. Such a large crossbow, even I am seeing it for the first time. In the records of our Dwarf race, there were similar heavy siege crossbows on the Lost Continent, but those were eight-bolt siege crossbows meant for city wall defense. Compared to this heavy crossbow, the manufacturing process is more refined, capable of firing eight crossbow bolts simultaneously, and even the strongest fortress shields couldn't withstand its attack. However, although this crossbow can only fire one bolt, its attack intensity far surpasses the eight-bolt siege crossbow. After all, with all the elastic force concentrated on a single bolt, its power is much greater. However, this crossbow also has its own flaws. The sheer amount of resources required for repeatedly forged hundred-refined fine iron combined with tungsten steel and red copper is immense. Moreover, the weight of this crossbow presents a significant problem for magic users. If my judgment is correct, the weight of just one crossbow mechanism would exceed two hundred kilograms.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Indeed, two hundred and fifty kilograms. Brother Xi Lu, you are truly a warrior of the Dwarf race; your judgment is very accurate. Although this crossbow has extremely powerful attack capabilities, its weight becomes its biggest limitation. Without fighting spirit at the level of a Martial Artist, it's impossible to draw the crossbow. Even with the two movable pulleys on each side of the bowstring to reduce the pulling force, it's still not enough. And carrying a two-hundred-and-fifty-kilogram giant crossbow is not something ordinary people can do. Therefore, each of these heavy crossbows requires the coordination of three experts to unleash its power. Furthermore, this is only for single-target attack power. The crossbow's name is 'Godslayer'.\"\n\nXi Lu's entire body trembled. Upon hearing the last two words Nian Bing spoke, he immediately understood Nian Bing's intention and murmured, \"Godslayer, what a Godslayer Crossbow. Nian Bing, did you design this?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"I learned culinary arts from my master since I was young and was very fond of all sorts of craftsmanship, especially crossbows. As a magic user, I was at too much of a disadvantage when fighting against warriors. Unfortunately, I didn't have much money back then, otherwise, I would have definitely made a hand crossbow to carry with me. When I was young, I often fantasized, if I could create a super heavy crossbow, even a Saint-level expert might find it difficult to resist. Of course, the prerequisite is being able to hit the opponent. Therefore, I had some ideas, and later I drew a sketch when I had free time. Before coming here, I gave the sketch to Yan Feng, the King of the Ice Moon Empire. After he dispatched the best weapon designers to improve it, the Godslayer Crossbow came into being. The resources required to manufacture this thing are indeed enormous; the resources needed for one Godslayer Crossbow are enough to equip several heavy cavalrymen. Fortunately, the Ice Moon Empire itself is rich in various ores, allowing them to successfully manufacture these crossbow mechanisms. Initially, there will be ten units.\"\n\nXi Lu placed one hand under the crossbow mechanism, exerted force with his large hand, and lifted the two-hundred-and-fifty-kilogram heavy crossbow with one arm. Even the emotionless Blood Guards on the side couldn't help but show a slight change in expression. One must know that the crossbow mechanism is huge, and Xi Lu was supporting the rear part, while the front of the crossbow mechanism was the heaviest. Therefore, the weight he was bearing now was by no means as simple as two hundred and fifty kilograms. Seeing his relaxed expression, it seemed he wasn't exerting much effort. Moreover, the Godslayer Crossbow didn't even tremble in his hands. One must know that even a strongman with the strength of a thousand jin in his arms couldn't achieve this.\n\nNian Bing's hand flashed with silver light, and a bolt half a zhang long appeared in his hand. He handed the bolt to Xi Lu and smiled, \"Brother, let you test the first shot. Now that this thing is made, I also want to see its power. Under strong elastic force, I haven't set tail wings on this Godslayer bolt. If its straight-line attack distance can reach three hundred zhang, then my goal will be achieved.\"\n\nXi Lu took the iron bolt and couldn't help but laugh, \"What a grand undertaking! With fine iron and red copper for the bolt body, and tungsten steel for the arrowhead, this combined with the Godslayer Crossbow is truly perfect for penetration!\"\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile and said, \"Indeed! The value of this thing is extremely high. If it weren't for dealing with those divine beings, I wouldn't have asked the Ice Moon Empire to forge this for me! Try it, let's see the power.\"\n\nXi Lu nodded, placed the crossbow mechanism on the ground, leaned forward, and easily drew the bowstring, which originally required one foot to be braced on the crossbow, to its full extent. The entire crossbow mechanism made creaking sounds, and the front arc gradually bent. He hooked the bowstring, and the entire crossbow mechanism instantly sprung taut. Xi Lu inserted the Godslayer bolt Nian Bing gave him from the front and chuckled, \"It's got power, I'm also a bit excited.\" He lifted the Godslayer Crossbow again. He brought his eye close to the string, aimed at a snow mountain several hundred zhang away, gripped the handle below with his right hand, a gleam flashed in his eyes, and he instantly pulled the trigger.\n\nA piercing whistling sound accompanied the humming of the bowstring. Everyone only saw an afterimage, which disappeared in an instant. As the afterimage vanished, a huge roar sounded from the snow mountain almost instantly. Everyone stared in amazement as a large amount of snow mist sprayed up from the snow mountain in the distance. Nian Bing's mental power could almost be used as eyes. He clearly saw that on the body of the snow mountain three hundred zhang away, a hole nearly a zhang in diameter had appeared, and the hole was three zhang deep. The power of this single bolt was enough to rival the attack power of a Martial Saint, perhaps even surpass it. Seeing all this, he couldn't help but rejoice in his heart.\n\nXi Lu narrowed his eyes, looked at the large hole in the snow mountain, handed the crossbow mechanism back to the three Blood Guards, his expression subtly fluctuating as if he were contemplating something. Nian Bing walked to Xi Lu's side and said, \"Brother, what do you think of this thing? Used to deal with the divine-level experts of the Divine Continent, if fired in volleys, the effect should be quite good. Moreover, I plan to attach some magic to these crossbow bolts.\"\n\nXi Lu nodded and said, \"With added magic, the lethality will undoubtedly be greater, but I suggest you add single-target attack magic. Utilizing the bolt's penetration, if it's area-of-effect magic, the attack power will be dispersed and may not achieve the intended effect. The straight-line attack distance of this Godslayer Crossbow actually reached five hundred zhang, which is too terrifying. The straight-line attack distance of ordinary bows is only fifty zhang, and even strong bows wouldn't exceed a hundred zhang, while the eight-bolt giant crossbows of the Lost Continent only had a straight-line attack distance of three hundred zhang. The Godslayer Crossbow can unleash such power, which is greatly related to its materials. Such high intensity can only be achieved with these good materials. However, Nian Bing, your Godslayer Crossbow, precisely because of its long range, has some problems arising.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred. He knew that as a Dwarf, Xi Lu's skill in forging was far beyond his own. He quickly and humbly asked, \"Brother, in what aspect is it still lacking?\"\n\nXi Lu said, \"It should be no problem for your subordinates to operate one crossbow with the cooperation of three people, but your Godslayer Crossbow only has a simple mechanical sight. You must understand that human eyesight is limited after all. At a distance of five hundred zhang, even the elves of our Lost Continent would find it difficult to aim accurately. And we need to deal with those divine beings, so attack range is most important for magic users. It's best to inflict damage on the opponent from beyond five hundred zhang. The Godslayer Crossbow has sufficient attack power and range, but without good accuracy, your precious Godslayer bolts may only be wasted.\"\n\nSights? Nian Bing had indeed not carefully considered this issue. Hearing Xi Lu's words, he suddenly understood the relationship between distance and sights. Indeed, aiming solely with the eyes, perhaps only he could lock onto the opponent with his mental power. No matter how much practice his subordinates got, they might not be able to achieve precision. Could it be that the Godslayer Crossbow he had painstakingly commissioned was going to be useless?\n\nXi Lu looked at Nian Bing, whose brow was furrowed, and smiled, \"Brother, don't worry. Have you forgotten what your big brother does? I will solve this sight problem for you.\"\n\nNian Bing's face lit up with joy, \"Brother, do you have a way?\"\n\nXi Lu said proudly, \"We Dwarves are not boasting when we call ourselves masters of the forging world. Although the accuracy required for sights is very high, I am confident I can create them. How about this, you go to Ice Moon City again, and I'll write you a list. Prepare everything on the list for me, and I promise to equip these Godslayer Crossbows with eyes. By the way, how many Godslayer Crossbows are you preparing?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and looked at Xi Lu, \"Six hundred men, naturally means two hundred crossbows. I don't want our Blood Lion Cult's elites to suffer operational damage; the Godslayer bolts are their sharp weapon for dealing with divine beings.\"\n\nXi Lu nodded and said, \"Alright, then I will forge two hundred specialized aiming devices for you. However, your fire magic will be needed to help at that time.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and turned to the five hundred Blood Guards, \"See the snow mountain ahead? There are one hundred warriors from our Ice Moon Hall carrying out a mountain-clearing mission. From now on, you will also participate. The objective is to level this snow mountain. You five hundred people will be divided into three teams, each to merge with the three teams led by Hall Master Yin Dang. He will arrange everything you need to do. You will rotate every four hours, clearing the mountain in cycles.\"",

    "title": "Chapter 217: Starting on the Contest (Part 1)",
    "content": "\"Yes.\" A simple one-word reply, yet it represented the Blood Guards' confidence. Compared to the Ice Moon Hall warriors, they would execute orders from above without hesitation. Even if Nian Bing ordered them to commit mass suicide, they would not resist; executing orders was the Blood Guards' primary principle. Ten colossal God Slaying Crossbows were placed on the ground. Five hundred people transformed into five hundred dark red figures, heading towards the mountain peak. Their black, slender swords – could they be used to cleave mountains? Even Nian Bing was unsure of the answer.\n\nXie Lu used the paper and pen from Nian Bing's spatial ring to write down what he needed. Today was also the day Nian Bing needed to collect Wire-Thorn Snakes again. Carrying what Xie Lu had written, he immediately left the snow mountain and, through long-distance spatial teleportation magic, headed towards the Heavenly Slope Mountain Range.\n\nTime passed day by day. Two months was a long time, but certainly not short. Two months were enough for many things to happen. Yin Dang and his subordinates were greedy for Nian Bing's intensive training, and although the Blood Guards did not speak, they executed Nian Bing's orders even more resolutely. In the blink of an eye, a month and a half had passed. And the tall snow mountain was now only two-thirds of its original size. Such a result, no one could have predicted it except Nian Bing. In a month and a half, a mountain several hundred zhang high had disappeared. When Yin Dang came down from the mountain and looked at the masterpiece he and his subordinates had created, he could not help but sigh in admiration. For this month and a half, they had been living a repetitive life. Every three days, Nian Bing would bring a batch of Wire-Thorn Snakes back, simmering the snake gallbladders into soup for them to drink, and the snake meat as their food. Every five days, Nian Bing would also bring large quantities of vegetables for them to eat with the snake meat. Their strength increased day by day, and although it was directly related to the Wire-Thorn Snake gallbladders, it was also inseparable from their constant efforts. Through continuous release and condensation of Dou Qi, they completely absorbed the energy of the Wire-Thorn Snake gallbladders, and the effect was even better than when Nian Bing had eaten the Wire-Thorn Snake gallbladders back then. After all, they were warriors themselves.\n\nAs warriors who cultivated Dou Qi, their strength improved remarkably. Now, even they themselves did not know what level they had reached.\n\nThe progress of the mountain-destroying operation was recalled from the moment the five hundred Blood Guards arrived. The five hundred Blood Guards did it simply; they did not use their Dou Qi to blast the mountain body. Instead, in the wind and snow, they used their black刺剑 (dagger-sword) to assist their Ice Moon Hall colleagues. Every time their 刺剑 was thrust out, their Dou Qi was completely condensed. The sharp Dou Qi could directly penetrate the mountain body for about a zhang. The strongest Blood Guards could even penetrate three zhang. After a hundred and sixty Blood Guards per team simultaneously pierced the mountain, the experts of Ice Moon Hall would then attack. This way, every Dou Qi attack would save more than three times the Dou Qi compared to a direct attack, yet achieve more than twice the previous effect. This greatly accelerated the pace of mountain destruction. Moreover, whether it was the Blood Guards or the Ice Moon Hall experts, their strength was constantly improving under the nourishment of the Wire-Thorn Snake gallbladders. This led to the current excellent results.\n\nThe experts of Ice Moon Hall initially thought they could contend with the Blood Guards after this period of training. But when the Blood Guards also participated in this intensive training, they dismissed that idea. It was not because their individual strength was inferior to the Blood Guards, but because the Blood Guards made them understand what it meant to be a killer trained from the age of three.\n\nIf measured by Dou Qi, these Blood Guards, whose age did not exceed their early forties, were at most at the level of a Martial Fighter. There wasn't even a single Martial Saint. However, even Yin Dang did not have absolute confidence that he could kill a Martial Fighter-level Blood Guard in a life-or-death battle. The most terrifying thing about these Blood Guards was their invisible killing intent and their tricky attack methods. No matter how they attacked, their poisoned swords attacked in points. The Dou Qi of a Martial Fighter condensed into a point, and the terrifying attack power could only be understood by those who had truly faced it. Moreover, the Blood Guards were not afraid of death. In their minds, their lives belonged to the Blood Lion Cult. For someone who was not afraid of death, even if you could cut them, their sword would likely be inserted into your vital spot at the same time. Originally, when the Blood Guards first drank the腥汤 (bloody soup) made from the Wire-Thorn Snake gallbladders, Yin Dang's subordinates intended to watch the fun. But when they watched in stunned silence as one Blood Guard after another drank three ladlefuls of the腥汤 with unchanged expressions, they could only feel admiration for these elites of elites, called the elites of the Blood Lion Cult. And in the mountain-destroying operation, the Blood Guards were very cooperative with the Ice Moon Hall experts. They were almost tireless, only resting after exhausting every bit of strength and even being unable to lift their swords. Driven by the Blood Guards, although Nian Bing did not have special requirements, the Ice Moon Hall experts' training also became more rigorous. Therefore, after a month and a half, they achieved such results. The thousand zhang snow mountain had less than three hundred zhang remaining. Looking at the results before them, everyone's hearts were filled with confidence.\n\nIf one were to say who worked the hardest during this month and a half, even the Blood Guards who were desperately cleaving the mountain would say it was the Cult Master. Yes, Nian Bing's hard work was evident to all. He not only had to frequently go to the Heavenly Slope Mountain Range to collect Wire-Thorn Snakes, but also to Ice Moon City to purchase some necessities. When he had nothing else to do, he had to constantly work. His work was extremely arduous. Apart from him, it was likely that no magician on the Radiant Continent could do the same thing.\n\nGod Slaying Arrows. The tip of each God Slaying Arrow was inlaid with a thumb-sized gemstone. The gemstones were of two colors: red and blue. What Nian Bing had been doing these days was inlaying red and blue gemstones onto these arrows. Of course, it was not simple inlaying; inlaying was only the first process. Tungsten steel, though hard, was nothing under his Heavenly Fire, which could melt iron and transform gold. The truly difficult part was the process of sealing a Detection Nightmare magic within the gemstone.\n\nMagic scrolls could store magic, and they were made from magic crystal powder. Therefore, magic crystals could naturally store magic. However, the size of the God Slaying Arrows was limited. The widest part was the arrowhead, so the gemstone could only be inlaid there. The thumb-sized red and blue gemstones were not very precious. In the Ice Moon Empire, where ancient minerals were abundant, such a gemstone was worth at most two to three purple gold coins. Even high-grade gemstones rarely exceeded ten purple gold coins. The amount of magical energy stored in a gemstone was directly related to its volume. Such small gemstones were far inferior to those top-quality magic white scrolls. Moreover, the crafting of magic scrolls involved special craftsmanship, making it relatively easier to cast magic spells on them. Sealing magic elements on these ordinary crystals and then activating them with clever incantations was extremely difficult. Even Bing Jie, the former High Priestess of the Ice Snow Goddess, who was known as the number one magician on the continent, would probably have a success rate of no more than one-tenth. Nian Bing had been engaged in such work for the past month and a half. Furthermore, in the gemstones of those God Slaying Arrows, he was storing single-target attack magic of up to the ninth tier.\n\nGod Slaying Arrows with sealed ninth-tier attack magic were true God Slaying Arrows. In later generations, the price of a single God Slaying Arrow would probably be something Nian Bing never imagined. Tungsten steel as the arrowhead, red copper and fine iron as the arrow shaft, plus ninth-tier attack magic. What kind of concept was that? Xie Lu once used the Ice Moon City's twenty zhang thick city wall as a metaphor. It would take three fire-attribute God Slaying Arrows to create a large hole in the Ice Moon City wall, large enough for an army to charge through.\n\nNian Bing's success rate was astonishing to everyone, actually reaching ninety percent. What immense mental power was required for that! After seeing Nian Bing make the tenth God Slaying Arrow, the two words Xie Lu most often uttered were \"monster.\" He also directly called Nian Bing \"monster\" when addressing him. In a month and a half, while busy with other matters, Nian Bing had already produced over twelve hundred God Slaying Arrows, which meant over twelve hundred ninth-tier magic spells! Although he did not cultivate intentionally, the process of making the God Slaying Arrows was a great challenge to his magical power, magic control, and mental strength. Therefore, as a month and a half passed, Nian Bing's own strength had also undergone some changes. Although it was not apparent on the surface, Nian Bing himself knew how important this month and a half had been to him.\n\nIn a month and a half, the items Nian Bing needed had been delivered one after another. Two hundred God Slaying Crossbows were quietly placed in a small mountain hollow nearby. That was also where Xie Lu went most often. He went there every day to inspect the finished God Slaying Crossbows and fine-tune them to make them even more perfect.\n\nThe master blacksmith of the dwarf race was not playing around. Xie Lu used some ordinary materials to compensate for many deficiencies in the God Slaying Crossbows. For example, by installing two iron wheels on the front of the God Slaying Crossbow, it allowed the crossbow to be pulled rather than dragged by vehicles for long-distance travel, enabling one person to complete the task of three. He also made some adjustments to the pulleys and bowstrings. Under his efforts, the attack power of the God Slaying Crossbows increased further. Of course, the most important thing he did was to add a special aiming device to the God Slaying Crossbows. Nian Bing was so busy that he was in a frenzy, and Xie Lu was being somewhat mysterious. Until now, Nian Bing still didn't understand what Xie Lu had been doing all along.\n\n\"Reporting to the Cult Master, the one hundred and one members of our Ice Moon Hall and five hundred Blood Guards of the Blood Lion Cult have all arrived.\" Yin Dang's voice was resonant and powerful.\n\nNian Bing looked at Yin Dang, whose face was now covered in beard and whose hair was disheveled, with satisfaction and smiled, \"Hall Master Yin, you have worked hard.\"\n\nYin Dang turned and retreated to the side. Nian Bing's gaze swept over these six hundred elite members of the Blood Lion Cult. Not having bathed for over a month was definitely not a pleasant experience, but behind their dirty faces, everyone's eyes were much brighter than when they first arrived. Seeing their vigorous spirits, Nian Bing nodded and said, \"Time passes quickly. In the blink of an eye, a month and a half have passed like this. In this month and a half, you have achieved even better results than I expected. The task that seemed impossible to complete is about to be successful through your unremitting efforts. You are indeed the elites of our Blood Lion Cult. Starting today, the training methods will change. The two hundred God Slaying Crossbows are completed, and it's time for you to test them. I don't think you are very much looking forward to this moment, and neither am I. So, starting today, you will enter the process of testing the crossbows. The target is the snow mountain. However, do not rejoice too early, because it is too difficult to make God Slaying Arrows, so your test shots will use wooden arrows. Now, pair up yourselves, three people per team, go and bring out our treasures, and take turns to test-fire.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" Amidst a resounding affirmation, everyone headed towards the mountain hollow. Although they could only shoot wooden arrows, the thought of the immense power Xie Lu displayed during his test shot that day made even the stoic Blood Guards feel their blood surge.\n\nIn a short while, six hundred people carrying two hundred heavy crossbows appeared before Nian Bing.\n\nLooking at their proud and high-spirited demeanor, Nian Bing smiled slightly and walked to a heavy crossbow. He said, \"I will take the first shot, and let you all see the true power of the God Slaying Crossbow.\" As he spoke, he walked to a God Slaying Crossbow, and with a flash of silver in his hand, a God Slaying Arrow appeared. The gemstone on the arrowhead was red.\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Xie Lu flashed beside Nian Bing and smiled, \"Since we are starting the test shots, it's time for you to see my efforts these past few days.\" As he spoke, he reached under the God Slaying Crossbow in Nian Bing's hand and attached a cylinder that fitted the crossbow body. The cylinder was about two feet long and as thick as a child's arm. Each end of the cylinder was inlaid with a red gemstone. The gemstones were very bright and convex.\n\nXie Lu smiled and said, \"This is the aiming scope I made. Each God Slaying Crossbow is already equipped with one, and the accuracy has been adjusted to the best. You just need to bring your eyes close to the gemstone at the back and look towards the other side. You will see a black cross appearing at the red gemstone. Aim at the center of the cross, and any target within five hundred zhang can be easily hit. The crossbow itself is very stable, so the arrows shot are absolutely precise with the help of the aiming scope.\"\n\nNian Bing curiously brought his eyes close to the red gemstone. Instantly, the snow mountain, which was originally hundreds of zhang away, seemed to be right before his eyes. He could clearly see things on the snow mountain. Xie Lu held a round object on top of the cylinder and said, \"Rotate this to adjust the distance. If the distance is very close, you can move the crystal stone on the other side away, so that it won't affect the attack on close-range targets.\"",

    "content": "A black cross was clearly presented before his eyes, revealing a transparent red.\n\nSeeing the clear scenery and this black cross, Nian Bing couldn't help but admire it. \"What a clever design! With this, the Zhushen Ballista's 500-zhang attack range can be maximized.\"\n\nXi Lu said, \"With one hand,\"\n\nThe bowstring pulled the front of the bow body, bending it into an arc. He hooked the bowstring, took the Zhushen Arrow from Nian Bing's hand, and loaded it into the chamber. He said slightly, \"You can start. Choose a smaller target, and you'll know how precise my invention is.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. He held the bow body with one hand and placed the other on the trigger. He gently rotated the crossbow. The crossbow body, supported by two shoulder rests, was equipped with a circular track by Xi Lu. This way, the two in front only needed to stand still, and the person behind responsible for firing the crossbow could easily rotate in any direction to attack.\n\n\"Very well,\" Nian Bing chose a spot in the center of the snow mountain, where there was a protruding rock. He pulled the trigger.\n\nThe piercing shriek that had been heard before left a deep impression on everyone. It was as if the air was being torn apart by the Zhushen Arrow's speed. The arrow created a phantom trail. In an instant, with a huge explosion, the area Nian Bing saw through the aiming scope turned into a sea of fire. The immense roar, along with the remaining nearly 300 zhang of the snow mountain, seemed to tremble. A large amount of ice mist appeared and then vanished in the flames. The roar was not just because of the Zhushen Arrow's attack; a ninth-tier single-target fire magic also played a significant role. According to Nian Bing's design, the magic would only be released when the red crystal was crushed. As for attacks like the Zhushen Arrow, each arrow shot out was almost impossible to retrieve. The two forces combined, and the resulting power could only be described as terrifying.\n\nThe flames didn't burn for long before disappearing. This time, although hundreds of zhang away from the snow mountain, everyone saw the massive crater, five meters in diameter and ten meters deep. Compared to the Zhushen Arrow without added magic, its power had increased several times over.\n\nYin Dang murmured to himself, \"If this thing were used to attack a city...\" He paused. \"What city gate could withstand the power of the Zhushen Arrow?\"\n\nThe ice layer on the snow mountain's surface was completely pierced by this arrow. Through the aiming scope, he saw the scorched rock inside. Nian Bing cheered excitedly, \"Success! One plus one is indeed not as simple as two. In this environment, fire elementals are somewhat restricted, yet it still has such great power. Look, those gods are in trouble.\"\n\nWith such a Zhushen Ballista, even Nian Bing would need to be fully focused to defend against it, and he couldn't withstand dozens of arrows without getting hurt. The combination of ninth-tier single-target magic and the Zhushen Arrow's own power could achieve at least the attack power of tenth-tier magic, with even greater penetration. This was simply the best weapon for war! However, Nian Bing naturally didn't intend to use these things for war, but to deal with certain gods whom he couldn't defeat with his own strength.\n\nXi Lu took the Zhushen Ballista from Nian Bing's hand and said loudly to all his Blood Lion Cult subordinates, \"Everyone, watch carefully. I'll do it three times. Now, under each Zhushen Ballista, such an aiming scope is hidden. When needed, it can be directly turned up, pulled back, and inserted into the card slot. Right now, the crosshairs are properly placed. No need to move. The red gemstone on top has a light-filtering effect, which can prevent strong light from dazzling and achieve better aiming.\" As he spoke, he slowly demonstrated the three steps of assembling and disassembling the aiming scope. It was indeed very simple, and everyone understood it at a glance.\n\nNian Bing thought to himself, \"Brother Xi Lu, if you could inject some light element into the gemstone on your aiming scope, we could also identify targets through it at night.\"\n\nXi Lu's eyes shone with divine light. He slapped his thigh forcefully and said, \"Yes! How did I not think of that? Injecting light elements into these magic stones...\" He continued, \"Perhaps it's difficult for others, but for a monster like you, it's incredibly simple. We can try it first. If it doesn't affect the accuracy, that would be great. With this at night, the Zhushen Ballista can become a sharp tool for assassination.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said to his subordinates, \"Good. From now on, you will line up here. Use the snow mountain as a target and practice. Everyone, familiarize yourselves with the characteristics of the crossbow first. Take turns practicing lifting the crossbow and pulling the string. I will be responsible for the training wooden arrows you need. Don't worry about anything else. If you have any mechanical questions, ask Brother Xi Lu. Let's start now.\"\n\nSeeing that Nian Bing and Xi Lu had each used the Zhushen Ballista once, these elites of the Blood Lion Cult had already understood how to use it. Although the crossbow string was extremely strong, it could still be pulled by masters of the martial artist level. Therefore, in every group of three, there was bound to be a martial artist. They each fiddled with the huge crossbow, instantly becoming busy. However, their movements were very small, for fear of damaging the 250-kilogram heavy crossbow in their hands. Possessing such great destructive power, even the Blood Guards were reluctant to put it down. For a time, they were all engrossed in the process of familiarizing themselves with the Zhushen Ballista.\n\nWhile they were getting familiar with the Zhushen Ballista, Nian Bing was not idle. He didn't inject the light element into the Zhushen Ballista's aiming scope first. Instead, he and Xi Lu came to the mountain hollow where the Zhushen Ballista was originally placed. Xi Lu's hand flashed with black light, and the God-Slaying Axe appeared out of thin air. He chuckled and said, \"Nian Bing, I'll do the chopping, and you'll do the making. What do you say?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"You're quite resourceful. Alright, you do the chopping, but trim off the extra branches and leaves. I only need the main trunk.\"\n\nXi Lu agreed and leaped forward. In this icy and snowy environment, the trees that could survive were all needle-leaved trees. Xi Lu's God-Slaying Axe brought forth waves of black light, and dou qi permeated the air. Tree after tree fell with a loud crash. He didn't need to get close at all; the dou qi emanating from the axe alone could easily accomplish what Nian Bing asked him to do. Every time he trimmed the branches and leaves from a large tree, he would kick the trunk towards Nian Bing. His movements were extremely fast.\n\nAfter a while, Xi Lu's movements slowed down, not because his dou qi was depleted, but because he was stunned by Nian Bing's movements. Nian Bing started working from the first large tree kicked over by Xi Lu. Milky white light enveloped him, and the Long Life Blade Saint Radiance was in his right hand. The weight of the Saint Radiance was nothing to Nian Bing. As soon as the wood reached him, after a brief observation, he could determine the grain within the trunk using his mental power. When he first started learning cooking, observing wood grain and chopping firewood was his initial practice. Looking at the trees before him, he couldn't help but think of his teacher, Cha, and feel a sense of nostalgia. The Saint Radiance blade began to move. Nian Bing now possessed an incredibly vast mental power. Identifying wood grain only required a glance, and he could remember it without omission. With longing for his master, his blade moved. His wrist trembled. Even with Xi Lu's eyesight, he could only see a phantom of the blade. And within that phantom blade, the outer leaves of the wood flew out first. Then, wooden arrows were swept up by the blade light from another direction and landed on the ground, neatly stacked. The main trunk of a large tree was divided into several sections by Nian Bing's lightning-fast blade light. Wherever he passed, only floating wooden arrows could be seen. And the size and shape of these wooden arrows were exactly the same, without any deviation, just like the Zhushen Arrows, with the same thickness. Xi Lu was dumbfounded. \"What kind of saber technique is this? It can achieve such precise cutting so quickly! Each arrow is identical. This requires how much precise judgment! No wonder this guy is definitely a monster.\"\n\nJust as Xi Lu was about to say something, Nian Bing's voice came, \"Xi Lu, Brother! The tree trunks are all used up. You need to speed up.\"\n\nXi Lu: \"...\"\n\n\"Fine, you win.\" While the two of them were busy, in just two hours, over ten thousand wooden arrows were made. When the subordinates of the Blood Lion Cult came to collect the arrows, most of them recognized them as arrows Nian Bing had brought from elsewhere. Only a few people saw the brand new wooden stakes not far away and vaguely guessed that these wooden arrows had just been made.\n\nThe half-month adjustment period quickly passed. The remaining three hundred zhang of the \"Snow Adding Frost\" was not completely destroyed, but it was already riddled with holes. When Nian Bing gave each Zhushen Ballista ten Zhushen Arrows, the two-month intensive training was over. Each group of three, carrying a Zhushen Ballista and five fire, five ice magic arrows, and ten Zhushen Arrows, quietly left the cold world under Nian Bing's leadership.\n\nIf anyone asked where the coldest place on the Aurora Continent was, perhaps any inhabitant of the Aurora Continent would answer, the Ice Extreme Province of the Ice Moon Empire. The Ice Extreme Province was located at the northernmost part of the Aurora Continent. There was only winter here. Even in the warmest season, the temperature would remain around minus ten degrees Celsius. During the severe winter, it had even recorded minus eighty degrees Celsius. The southern end of the Ice Extreme Province was a mountain range. This mountain range was called the Ice Extreme Mountains. This mountain range was the place that produced the most rare ores in the Ice Moon Empire. It was also this mountain range that blocked a large amount of cold air from the north, so that the temperature in Ice Moon City and the Ice Moon Empire south of the Ice Extreme Province was not so terrifyingly low. The coldness of the Ice Extreme Province was indeed too unbearable, so the population living in this province was less than that of a single city like Ice Moon City. In the province, there were only three small cities. Only laborers would come here to mine for ores to obtain the resources for survival. The three small cities in the Ice Extreme Province were arranged in a triangle in the central part of the province. And in the center of these three cities was a place called the Extreme Cold Land of the Aurora Continent. It was an ice field. The harsh environment made it impossible for humans to survive. Many people had predicted that the reason the Ice Extreme Province was so cold was precisely because of this Extreme Cold Land. The shape of the glacier was very special. Outside was a circle of ice about three hundred zhang high. No one knew how long these ice layers had existed or how thick they were. Within this circle of glaciers was a basin. Generally, even if it was an ice field, as long as there was a basin in the middle, the temperature in the basin would be a few degrees higher than the outer glaciers. But here it was different. This basin was the real Extreme Cold Land. Cold winds like ice knives formed small tornadoes in the basin. No animals could survive here. Even exhaling a breath would immediately turn into countless tiny ice crystals. Once encountered by the biting ice dragon, the only outcome was to turn into ice cubes and then be torn into pieces by the biting cold wind. Therefore, this place was also one of the famous death zones on the Aurora Continent.\n\nThe Extreme Cold Land still exuded its coldness as usual. The gloomy airflow could be clearly felt even a hundred miles away. At this time, large numbers of black shadows were heading towards the valley where the Extreme Cold Land was located. Their movements were not fast, but they did not seem to be affected by the gradually decreasing cold. They advanced in an orderly manner. Their steps seemed to be synchronized. At first glance, the mountains were covered with them, numbering over ten thousand. But these ten thousand people made no sound. As they approached the glacier, they began to climb. A strange thing happened. As some of the black shadows began to climb, wings actually grew from behind some of them, and they flew directly to the top of the glacier. Those without wings climbed upwards with their hands and feet directly inserted into the glacier. Their climbing speed on the ice seemed to be much faster than when they were walking. If an ordinary person saw this strange sight, they would definitely think these guys were crazy. It was already the coldest season on the continent, and within a few days, it would be the Great Cold period. The entire Ice Extreme Province would enter a low temperature of minus sixty degrees Celsius, and all work would stop. And this Extreme Cold Land could reach temperatures above minus one hundred degrees Celsius. This was simply not a place where humans could survive. But precisely because of the low temperature, no one would see the sudden appearance of a large number of black shadows heading towards the Extreme Cold Land. Xie Yue floated quietly in mid-air. He wasn't wearing much extra clothing. The surrounding cold gave him a feeling of extreme enjoyment. Of course, he didn't like the simple ice and snow, but rather the primeval yin qi contained within the extreme cold. For a Lich, this kind of primeval qi was extremely precious. Unfortunately, the primeval yin qi here could only last for a few days each year. Otherwise, Xie Yue would never leave here. The reason he was able to cultivate to the Lich realm back then was because he came here every year to absorb the primeval yin qi, making his death body extremely strong.",

    "content": "The Nether Witch Safen floated beside Xie Yue, the grey mist appearing much more condensed than before. \"Ah! This is so comfortable. Lord Xie, why didn't you bring us to such a good place earlier? If we could have found this place before, and cultivated here for ten years, it wouldn't have been so easy for those divine beings to bother us again.\"\n\nXie Yue said indifferently, \"The Innate Yin energy here only lasts for five days each year. Do you think it's here every day? If it were, I would have come long ago. Do you think I need you to tell me? This is the place with the strongest Yin and evil energy on the entire Yangguang Continent. Two days later, the once-in-a-few-hundred-years Ultimate Yin Day will arrive, and that will be our opportunity. I need to cast a spell at the Eye of Ultimate Yin to absorb the world's Ultimate Yin energy and break the seal on the Muordas Seal Bottle. At that time, no matter the cost, you and Sina must command our army to block anyone who tries to interfere.\"\n\nSafen quickly agreed, \"Yes, Lord Xie. Rest assured. This time, we joined forces to perform the Blood Moon Ceremony and summoned an army of 100,000 undead. After I filtered and fused them, the remaining 10,000 are mostly powerful individuals, primarily those who died unjustly. Their resentment is extremely strong, and the Yin and evil energy here is so abundant. It will definitely greatly boost the attack power of our undead army. With this, even if the Dragon Kings come, we can hold them off for a long time. After all, the Yin-absorbing Qi here only suits us and has an inhibitory effect on those guys.\"\n\nThe Blood Moon Ceremony is a very evil spell in undead magic, a 13th-tier Grand Summoning of the Undead. To save his magic power, Xie Yue joined forces with Safen and Sina to perform this evil ceremony. He summoned all the deceased within a certain range who were buried. They were divided into several parts based on their resentment and the condition of their bodies. The main types include zombies, vampires, and specters. Each type is further divided into different ranks. The stronger the person was in life, the stronger their undead form would be after being summoned by the Blood Moon Ceremony, such as the Zombie King leading the zombies, the Vampire King among vampires, and the Necromancer among specters. These high-level undead possess a certain degree of intelligence but are absolutely obedient to their summoner. As a forbidden magic spell, it would provoke immense public outrage. Once discovered, it would inevitably lead to a siege by all the nations on the continent. Therefore, when Xie Yue made this decision, although Sina hesitated, in order to break the seal on the Muordas Seal Bottle, Xie Yue could no longer care about such things and resolutely decided to use this ceremony. For this Blood Moon Ceremony, they massacred several villages in a remote mountain village in Bingyue City and then performed the summoning in a famous cemetery where warriors and mages were buried, which is how they got such a large undead army. After a period of integration, these undead have gained extremely strong combat power, especially in aerial combat. The aerial troops composed of vampires and specters fill Xie Yue with confidence. Even if they can't repel beings like the Seven Dragon Kings, they can at least serve as a deterrent. Once his process of unsealing is complete, everything will be under his dominion.\n\nCold. It can affect humans, but the Innate Yin energy here is what all dark forces love the most. In this place, zombies and vampires can survive without drinking blood, and they will live even better. Seeing the undead army enter the glacier, Xie Yue waved his hand, and under the cover of greenish mist, flew towards the interior of the glacier.\n\nYouyou and Ping Chao silently followed behind Xie Yue. Youyou was wrapped in thick fur, with only her eyes exposed. At this moment, her eyes showed no emotional fluctuations; it was a look of dead stillness. Ping Chao walked beside her, his gaze never leaving Youyou. Originally, Xie Yue had promised to let Ping Chao leave and live a free life, but Ping Chao himself did not leave. He couldn't bear to leave Youyou and insisted on accompanying her at this final moment, so he also came. Sensing the Yin and evil energy around him, his heart grew heavier. He understood that at this point, nothing could be avoided. Since Xie Yue had defied the world and launched the Blood Moon Ceremony, he had understood this Evil Lord's determination. His daughter's life could not compare to his ambition.\n\nJust as Xie Yue led his subordinates into the extreme cold region, about ten miles away, on a small hill, Nian Bing and others were using the aiming scopes of their Godslayer Crossbows as telescopes to observe everything.\n\nPutting down the aiming scope, Nian Bing frowned. \"What is that fellow Xie Yue trying to do? Where did he get so many subordinates? Judging from their movement on the mountain earlier, there are at least tens of thousands of them. If there were such a large group of dark cultivators in the dark world, our Blood Lion Cult should have received news by now. Hall Master Yin, what are your thoughts?\" The sudden appearance of so many dark cultivators made Nian Bing feel suspicious.\n\nYin Dang said, \"Cult Master is right. If there were such a vast evil force, as the strongest underground force, our Blood Lion Cult would not be unaware. However, Cult Master, have you observed carefully? The actions of those dark cultivators seem excessively orderly, like soldiers lined up for inspection. Moreover, these fellows have almost no trace of life aura on them. Wherever they pass, there is complete silence. Looking at it this way, they are probably not true dark cultivators.\"\n\nSilence. Nian Bing naturally sensed it. His body contained the purest death energy. Indeed, those dark cultivators who stepped onto the glacier had no trace of life aura. Originally, Nian Bing thought they were practicing special techniques. After hearing Yin Dang's words, he suddenly felt something was wrong. After thinking about it, he said, \"You mean those are not cultivators? Could it be... could it be undead?\" Thinking of the word \"undead,\" Nian Bing's heart trembled. Yes! Xie Yue, as a lich, was originally the most powerful undead mage. If those were all undead he summoned using undead magic, then this fellow would be too terrifying. He had indeed prepared long ago. It seemed that his thousand-year plan was not in vain. With tens of thousands of undead gathered in the extreme cold region, it seemed he could not act rashly. If his Blood Guards and Bingyue Hall warriors suffered any casualties, he would have suffered a great loss. Thinking of this, the light in his eyes flashed, and he made a decision. He turned to Xi Lu and said, \"Brother, how about we go take a look?\"\n\nXi Lu smiled slightly and said, \"Okay! I also want to see this lich you mentioned. Besides, if we get closer, we can also determine if those guys are really undead.\"\n\nYin Dang was anxious and said, \"Cult Master, you cannot risk going alone! If you must go, let us all go with you. That way, we can support each other.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"No, Xie Yue's subordinates are all undead and very difficult to deal with. Dealing with these guys, mages are much more suitable than warriors. Moreover, although they are numerous, I don't take them seriously yet. Even if Brother Xi Lu and I cannot kill them, as long as we want to leave, Xie Yue's people cannot stop us. Besides, we are going to negotiate. Don't ask too many questions. You just need to follow my orders. Although Xie Yue's evil dark forces are formidable, the guys we need to deal with are even more terrifying. All Blood Lion Cult members, set up the Godslayer Crossbows in place, load the Flaming Godslayer Arrows, and be ready to deal with any possible changes. Remember to hide your figures. If you encounter dragons flying by, do not attack. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, Cult Master.\" Although Yin Dang was unwilling, after these two months of sharing hardships, the subordinates of the Blood Lion Cult had a much deeper understanding and loyalty towards Nian Bing. Including himself, no one was willing to disobey Nian Bing's orders. With the continuous sound of mechanisms, the Godslayer Crossbows were set up. In the not-so-dense coniferous forest on the mountaintop, they had hidden their figures.\n\nNian Bing glanced at Maomao, whose eyes were flickering, and gently rubbed her head. He whispered, \"Maomao, be good. You stay here. Brother Xi Lu and I will be back soon. You must be obedient. It's very dangerous over there. If Brother finds out you secretly followed, Nian Bing brother will be angry.\" He knew Maomao's temper too well. The quieter she was, the bolder her thoughts might be.\n\n\"Wow, Nian Bing brother, how did you know what I was thinking? Okay, okay, I won't go. But you must come back quickly.\" If one were to ask who had increased their strength the most during the two months of intensive training, it would undoubtedly be Maomao. In these two months, her strength had more than doubled. This was not only because she had gradually absorbed the spiritual energy left by her parents but, more importantly, Nian Bing had given her all the magical beasts he had collected from the Divine Continent, including the Dark Demon Rats, to sign contracts with and use. This also fulfilled the wish of the mother and son Dark Demon Rats to be reunited. By possessing over ten powerful summoned beasts, Maomao had become a top summoner. It should be known that whether it was her own summoned beasts or those Nian Bing gave her, each of them was extraordinary in strength.\n\nAfter briefing Maomao, Nian Bing and Xi Lu took to the sky and flew towards the glacier, carried by the blizzard. Nian Bing discovered that in this extremely cold weather, casting ice magic was incredibly easy. Not only was the consumption of magic power incredibly low, but the magic intensity was also greatly increased. The speed of the blizzard and the consumption of magic power were far less than that of the Wind Soaring Technique.\n\nWhile flying, Xi Lu said to Nian Bing, \"Monster, are we playing with fire by dealing with the tiger this time? That fellow named Xie Yue is probably not easy to deal with. Are you ready?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Brother, do you know why I asked you to come with me? It's to gain Xie Yue's trust. I think he won't refuse two experts joining his ranks.\"\n\nXi Lu laughed heartily, \"Yes! You monster always have a way. I'm worrying unnecessarily. You handle everything as you see fit. It feels great to have you around. I don't have to rack my brain.\"\n\nThe ten-mile distance was covered in an instant. The closer they got to the glacier, the more obvious the cold feeling became. Even with Nian Bing's ice magic, the gusts of cold forced him to use his Heavenly Eye Domain for defense to avoid being affected by the cold. At this moment, the area outside the glacier had become calm again. The traces left by the undead army outside the glacier had also disappeared in the snow. In this cold world, the Yin and evil energy made Xi Lu very uncomfortable, whereas Nian Bing, having the purest ball of death within him, did not feel much. The two stopped on the glacier. As soon as they stopped, dozens of greenish lights flew towards them. The evil aura instantly intensified, accompanied by piercing shrieks, and layers of undead mental fluctuations drifted over. Various negative emotions such as death, anger, and fear arose, and dozens of undead simultaneously launched mental attacks on Nian Bing and Xi Lu. Xi Lu's willpower was extremely firm and naturally not something these undead could deal with. Nian Bing stood there without moving. As the dozens of undead gradually approached, the Heavenly Eye acupoint between his eyebrows instantly burst with golden light, and a powerful pressure was released. Amidst the shrill screams, dozens of undead instantly turned into nothingness, and the surroundings returned to a cold environment. Xi Lu snorted dismissively, using mental energy to attack Nian Bing, this monster. Besides courting death, he couldn't think of any other outcome.\n\nNian Bing stood in place and shouted, \"Lord Xie, an old acquaintance has come to visit, and you greet me with undead? Do you think this is how you treat guests?\" With the power of mental energy, his voice traveled far, covering the entire basin within the glacier.\n\nThe undead army in the basin below surged rapidly. Countless undead and vampires flew up and surrounded them from all directions. Two black figures flew ahead first, and they were Xie Yue and the Nether Witch Safen.\n\nUpon seeing Nian Bing's appearance, Xie Yue couldn't help but be surprised, \"You're not dead?\" Back in the Cold Valley, Nian Bing's life-threatening curse to block him had left a deep impression on him.\n\nNian Bing looked calmly at Xie Yue and smiled slightly, \"Lord Xie, I'm not here to be your enemy this time. What a grand display! How about we find a place to talk?\"\n\nAll the undead armies were under Xie Yue's control. He had naturally seen Nian Bing instantly destroy dozens of undead earlier. That golden light had made him feel a trace of fear. This young man before him seemed to have changed a lot, but he couldn't quite explain where the change was. Before he could answer, Safen, who was beside him, screamed, \"Lord Xie, this guy has been mingling with the Seven Dragon Kings! Let me kill him to eliminate future troubles.\" The grey airflow carried piercing screams and instantly spread outwards, and a vast death aura enveloped Nian Bing and Xi Lu.",

    "content": "Xilou stood there, not moving.\n\nHe knew, this didn't require him to lift a finger.\n\nEverything was enough for Nian Bing.\n\nSeeing Safen lunging towards him,\n\nNian Bing disdainfully snorted.\n\nHe raised his right hand.\n\nAs the冥 (Underworld Emperor) who cultivated undead magic alongside Xie Yue,\n\nSafen's strength was far inferior to the corporeal Xie Yue.\n\nUndead magic was merely a branch of dark magic,\n\nIts foundation was still dark elemental energy.\n\nSeven-colored light drifted from Nian Bing's raised right hand.\n\nAmong them, the streak of black light was just one.\n\nIt disappeared. The vast grey airflow around was instantly contained under the shroud of this seven-colored light.\n\nNian Bing reached out.\n\nThat seven-colored ribbon had completely encircled the grey airflow.\n\nThe faint golden light at his brow.\n\nGenerated immense pressure on Safen.\n\nHe didn't even have time to retaliate.\n\nAll the grey mist was already grasped by the seven-colored light's transformed large hand.\n\nAmidst a series of screams,\n\nHe struggled desperately,\n\nBut he couldn't break free from Nian Bing's control. Safen was a little flustered.\n\nHis spiritual imprint was suppressed tightly by Nian Bing,\n\nHe couldn't unleash his full strength.\n\nAnd the seven-colored light that grasped him,\n\nKept weakening his death energy.\n\nThat uncomfortable feeling filled him with dread.\n\nNian Bing didn't even look at Safen.\n\nHe turned to Xie Yue and said, \"Xie Yue,\n\nNow I think we can talk, right? For dark forces,\n\nThere's no more effective method than suppression by force.\"\n\nXie Yue's eyes flickered with green light.\n\n\"Well said, a Innate Domain.\n\nGathering, amplifying,\n\nAttack, defense,\n\nAmplified by one.\n\nYou've become much stronger since we last met. But,\n\nIf you're here for the Seven Dragon Kings and Moardas' Seal Bottle, then\n\nYour outcome will only be one:\n\nDo you recognize it?\n\nCan a mere Innate Domain be enough to convince me? Then you underestimate me, Xie Yue.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled lightly.\n\nAnd said, \"I already said just now,\n\nI'm not here to be your enemy.\n\nBut to discuss some matters with you. If I,\n\nAm here to help you?\"\n\nXie Yue was startled.\n\nAlthough he had made various guesses about Nian Bing's arrival in an instant,\n\nHe never expected Nian Bing to say such a thing. He was surprised and said, \"Help me? You're fighting fiercely with the Seven Dragon Kings,\n\nEven willing to risk your life to protect him.\n\nYou'll help me? Do you take me for a three-year-old child?\" As he spoke,\n\nA large number of vampires had already surrounded Nian Bing and Xilou.\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"No,\n\nI am indeed here to help you.\n\nI am friends with the Seven Dragon Kings,\n\nBut when facing great right and wrong,\n\nI have my own stance. You can also understand it as I'm not here to help you. I've come this time for the sake of Yang Guang Continent,\n\nOr you can say for the long-lost Lost Continent.\n\nAs the Demon Lord, don't you dare not talk with us two? This will do you no harm.\n\nIf we can't reach an agreement, you can still order your subordinates to attack me. If our negotiations succeed,\n\nYou'll gain two more helpers.\n\nSuch a good deal,\n\nWhy wouldn't the Demon Lord do it? His tone was very calm,\n\nWithout revealing any flaws.\n\nThe inscrutable smile on his face made Xie Yue unable to fathom his true intentions.\n\nXie Yue was able to form the current situation,\n\nHis capabilities were beyond doubt.\n\nBut for the sake of opening Moardas' Seal Bottle this time,\n\nHe didn't know how much effort he had put in.\n\nAt this critical moment,\n\nNian Bing's arrival brought him intense crisis,\n\nWhich was why he was so tense. After hearing Nian Bing's words,\n\nHis mind gradually relaxed.\n\nYes,\n\nThere were only two people on the other side.\n\nWhat did he have to fear?\n\nWhen,\n\nXie Yue nodded.\n\n\"Alright.\n\nFollow me.\" The surrounding vampires dispersed.\n\nNian Bing flicked his sleeve,\n\nThrew Safen aside,\n\nAnd with Xilou, soared into the air,\n\nFollowing Xie Yue into the ice valley. As they descended,\n\nNian Bing truly felt the harsh environment.\n\nThe closer they got to the extreme cold land below,\n\nThe stronger this feeling became.\n\nIntense cold,\n\nUnder the action of small tornadoes like ice blades, constantly assaulted from all directions.\n\nAmong the undead army, except for the bodiless undead,\n\nEveryone was covered in a layer of frost. From afar,\n\nHe could see a faint grey-blue airflow constantly rising upwards in the basin,\n\nAnd right at that spot,\n\nA large number of undead were busy doing something unknown.\n\nXie Yue landed on the ground with Nian Bing and Xilou.\n\nThe Vampire Queen Saina and the Underworld Witch Safen both hurried over.\n\nThey looked at Nian Bing and the other two warily behind Xie Yue.\n\nXie Yue dismissed the surrounding undead.\n\nHe said calmly, \"What is it?\n\nYou can speak now.\n\nIf you truly want to cooperate with me,\n\nThen you should show me your sincerity.\n\nHow can I believe you?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly.\n\n\"Since I've come here,\n\nOf course, I have great sincerity.\n\nYour Excellency the Demon Lord,\n\nHow much confidence do you have in opening the seal of Moardas' Seal Bottle?\"\n\nXie Yue said proudly, \"At least seventy percent.\n\nAlthough the Seven Dragon Kings are strong,\n\nBut,\n\nAs you can see my arrangements here.\n\nAlthough I dare not say my undead army can destroy them,\n\nAt least they can stop them until I complete the opening of the seal. For this,\n\nI have made arrangements for too long.\n\nThis time,\n\nNo matter what the cost,\n\nI must complete it.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded.\n\n\"Since you have the heart to unseal and recall the Lost Continent,\n\nThen,\n\nI believe Your Excellency the Demon Lord must have some understanding of the Great War of Divine Remnants back then.\n\nRegarding the Divine Continent's situation,\n\nHaven't you ever thought about the reaction of the Divine Continent if you obtain the seven Moardas' Seal Bottles? Will they allow you to bring back the Lost Continent? The Lost Continent connects the Yang Guang Continent and the Divine Continent.\n\nWhen the Lost Continent returns,\n\nThe threat to the Divine Continent will be immense.\"\n\nXie Yue frowned, \"Don't try to alarm me here.\n\nNo,\n\nThe Divine Continent and the Lost Continent are mortal enemies. But,\n\nThe Divine Continent also has a rule that they cannot freely leave their sealed range.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly.\n\n\"It seems Your Excellency the Demon Lord has done quite a lot of research on the Divine Continent! No,\n\nYou're right.\n\nThe Divine Continent does have such a rule. But,\n\nThe seal must be broken under certain circumstances.\n\nWhen what you do threatens the existence of the Divine Continent,\n\nDo you think\n\nThey will continue to ignore it? I can tell you now,\n\nThe Divine Continent has already broken its own rules.\n\nA total of twelve divine beings have already arrived on the Yang Guang Continent,\n\nSearching for your whereabouts everywhere.\n\nYou hide very well,\n\nThey haven't found you. But,\n\nYou are preparing to break the seal here.\n\nThis Ultimate Yin Land Continent has only one way.\n\nWon't they come looking for you? Twelve individuals with strength not inferior to the Dragon King's Crown,\n\nPlus the Seven Dragon Kings,\n\nYour arrangements might not be enough. \"\n\nAfter hearing Nian Bing's words,\n\nXie Yue's heart was greatly shaken.\n\nIf it was as he said,\n\nAnd the twelve divine beings had already arrived on the Yang Guang Continent,\n\nThen he truly wouldn't have even a sliver of a chance.\n\nWhat kind of strength did divine-level experts possess?\n\nXie Yue roughly knew.\n\nJust as Nian Bing said,\n\nWhen his actions threatened the existence of the Divine Continent,\n\nIt was normal for the Divine Continent to react.\n\nThinking of this,\n\nXie Yue's heart felt a chill.\n\nBut,\n\nDeep down,\n\nHe was still unwilling to admit this.\n\n\"How can you make me believe you?\n\nBased on your word alone?\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly,\n\n\"I know,\n\nYou doubt me. How could I know this?\n\nIn fact,\n\nI just returned from the Divine Continent. No,\n\nPerhaps you don't believe I've been there,\n\nBut you saw what happened last time.\n\nWhy was I able to be resurrected? It was precisely because the Dragon God, out of his kindness to the dragon race,\n\nTook me to the Divine Continent to seek help,\n\nThat I was able to return alive. Before coming here,\n\nI encountered two divine beings,\n\nAnd personally experienced their strength.\n\nOne of the powerful ones had reached the thirteenth tier.\n\nIt took the combined efforts of several of us,\n\nTo kill him.\n\nDo you know why I killed the divine being? Because,\n\nOnce the Divine Continent's seal is completely broken,\n\nIt will bring a great disaster to the Yang Guang Continent. And the Divine Remnant War back then,\n\nAlthough it's unclear who was right or wrong,\n\nThe Lost Continent bravely fought against the Divine Continent only for its freedom.\n\nOh, better for the Lost Continent to be destroyed,\n\nEngage in chaotic war with the Divine Continent,\n\nRather than have the Yang Guang Continent,\n\nThis world I live in, suffer even the slightest harm.\n\nThis is why I chose to cooperate with you.\n\nBelieve it or not,\n\nIn two days,\n\nI think my words will be proven.\n\nNo,\n\nBy then,\n\nIt will likely be too late for you to cooperate with me.\n\nNow, what lies before you,\n\nIs to gamble that I haven't lied to you.\"\n\nXie Yue fell into deep thought.\n\nThe Vampire Queen Saina beside him also fell into thought.\n\nOnly the Underworld Witch Safen yelled,\n\n\"Stop spewing nonsense here!\n\nYou must be a spy sent by the Seven Dragon Kings!\n\nWanting to infiltrate our ranks,\n\nAnd then collude with the Seven Dragon Kings from within and without.\n\nYour Excellency the Demon Lord,\n\nDo not believe him!\n\nOtherwise,\n\nIt will surely bring us destruction!\"\n\nNian Bing glanced coldly at the Underworld Witch Safen.\n\nHis mass of grey mist was now much dimmer than before.\n\nUnder the weakening attack of the Heavenly Eye Domain,\n\nHe would not be able to recover to his best state for at least three hours. Safen,\n\n\"Stop yelling in front of me. Don't think you've survived for thousands of years.\n\nI'll tell you frankly,\n\nAmong the divine beings who came from the Yang Guang Continent this time,\n\nOne is the Holy Master.\n\nDo you think he will let you go?\"\n\nSafen's body trembled.\n\nLast time, when the Holy Master's divine sense activated the Holy Radiance Blade,\n\nHe had just awakened,\n\nHis strength was far from recovered,\n\nAnd he almost turned to dust in the holy aura of the Holy Radiance Blade.\n\nTowards the Holy Master,\n\nHe had an innate fear.\n\nHearing Nian Bing mention these two words,\n\nHis arrogant demeanor immediately subsided.\n\nJust then,\n\nNian Bing raised his right hand.\n\nA black light lit up.\n\nXie Yue instantly became vigilant.\n\nThe green light in his eyes immediately turned blood red.\n\nBut,\n\nThe black light was not attacking him.\n\nInstead, it transformed into a figure,\n\nA figure completely identical to Nian Bing.\n\nOnly everything was black.\n\nGradually,\n\nThis dark figure began to change.\n\nIt transformed into the shape of a middle-aged man.\n\nThis man's face was stern,\n\nHis entire body exuded an invisible killing intent.\n\nHe glanced coldly at the Underworld Witch Safen.\n\n\"Shut your damned mouth.\n\nFor so many years,\n\nYou haven't improved at all. With Nian Bing's strength,\n\nThere's no need to waste words with you.\n\nIf you want to die,\n\nI can fulfill you anytime.\"\n\nHis cold, hard tone was filled with fierce killing intent.\n\nThe Underworld Witch Safen's grey mist instantly stopped fluctuating.\n\nThe fear, at least ten times greater than when he heard the words \"Holy Master,\" instantly permeated him.\n\n\"Great,\n\nIs it you? Is it really you? You're not...\"\n\nHe unexpectedly hadn't died. The grey mist condensed into a phantom human form, kneeling before the black figure.\n\nThe grey light trembled unceasingly.\n\nXie Yue's eyes were filled with shock.\n\nHe knew very well that the person the Underworld Witch Safen called \"Big Brother\"\n\nThere was only one in this world:\n\nThat was the Black Warrior Emperor, one of the eight great heavenly kings of the dark forces back then,\n\nWho had once defeated the Dark Dragon King Kajiouxis in a one-on-one battle. That cold killing intent,\n\nThose deep eyes,\n\nAll filled Xie Yue with shock.\n\nHow could the Black Warrior Emperor be here?\n\nLooking at his appearance,\n\nHe seemed to be without a physical body.\n\nWith a flash of black light in his hand,\n\nThe Demon Devouring Blade jumped into the Black Warrior Emperor's hand.\n\nHe gently stroked the blade.\n\nHe said calmly, \"Safen,\n\nGet up. Because you were once my brother,\n\nI won't treat you unfairly.\n\nBut,\n\nYou must watch your mouth.\n\nCurrently,\n\nNian Bing is my master.\n\nIf you dare to insult him again,\n\nDon't blame me for not remembering our brotherhood.\"\n\nThe Demon Devouring Blade suddenly swung.\n\nA powerful suction force enveloped the Underworld Witch Safen.\n\nSafen screamed.\n\nA stream of dark red light emerged from his body,\n\nDisappearing into the light emanating from the Demon Devouring Blade.\n\nThe Black Warrior Emperor glanced at Xie Yue.\n\n\"What a domineering curse.\n\nIt seems my brother isn't truly submitting to you. Xie Yue,\n\nIn my eyes,\n\nYou are just a follower.\n\nI, in the name of the Black Warrior Emperor, tell you,\n\nEverything Nian Bing said,\n\nNot a single word is false.\n\nHow you decide, depends on yourself.\n\nCooperation requires both sides to show their strength. His,\n\nHad already removed the curse that the Underworld Witch Safen had placed on Xie Yue when he submitted. Now,\n\nThe Underworld Witch Safen was no longer controlled by Xie Yue.\n\nAnd this,\n\nHad long been within Nian Bing's plan.\n\nIndeed,\n\nEverything he had said before,\n\nNian Bing had not lied about a single word.",

    "content": "Safin floated up from the ground, his body still trembling. Compared to Xiyue, he definitely trusted Hei Wu Huang more. Back then, if it weren't for Hei Wu Huang, he would have died countless times already. At least he was sure of one thing: Hei Wu Huang would definitely not harm or use him. In a sense, Hei Wu Huang was not like people from the darkness. Although he was extremely domineering, he had never told a lie in his life. Neither his enemies nor his brothers would doubt his every word.\n\nSafin looked at Xiyue's confused gaze and quickly said, \"Lord Xiyue, this is indeed my elder brother. Although he no longer has a physical body, I will never forget his aura. Only my elder brother would possess such an aura! Brother, how did you survive? Back then, I thought you had already... You're back, brother, I've missed you so much! We were eight brothers back then, and now only the two of us are left. Brother, please don't abandon me again this time.\" Rather than being controlled by the Evil Lord, how could it compare to following an elder brother who cared for him?\n\nHei Wu Huang said calmly, \"I indeed could not resist the Divine Punishment of that year. My physical body was destroyed, but at the moment of its destruction, I extracted my spiritual power and soul, entering the Demon Devouring Blade to slumber. You fool, actually, I have always been by your side, but you only focused on your own cultivation. Fortunately, Nian Bing picked me up; his courage earned my approval. Under the influence of his innate energy, I was gradually awakened, and by absorbing some dark energy, I gradually recovered. Now, like you, I am also an energy body.\"\n\nXiyue looked at Safin and Hei Wu Huang, his eyes flashing. He knew very well that Hei Wu Huang's appearance made it very difficult for him to control Safin any longer, and the situation was no longer under his control. Because Safin was restricted by his Earth Curse, among the undead army summoned during this Blood Moon Grand Ceremony, apart from the vampires controlled by Suna, most of the others were controlled by Safin. What was happening before him now was that Safin no longer needed to be controlled by him; he would definitely stand with Hei Wu Huang. And Hei Wu Huang called Nian Bing his master, so he had no choice. Moreover, in the records of Hei Wu Huang, he had indeed never told a lie. If Nian Bing truly wanted to cooperate with him, why should he turn against them?\n\nUpon thinking of this, Xiyue immediately made a decision, put on a smile, and said, \"Congratulations to Hei Wu Huang on his resurrection. Since you approve, I am naturally willing to cooperate with Brother Nian Bing.\"\n\nWhen Nian Bing made up his mind, he had already discussed Safin's matter with Hei Wu Huang, which led to the current scene. Looking at Xiyue's flickering eyes, he knew that although Xiyue had compromised on the surface, he had not truly recognized the cooperation. Now that Safin was controlled by Hei Wu Huang, it meant indirect control over part of the undead. If, coupled with his six hundred subordinates and two hundred God Slaying Crossbows, Nian Bing was confident that he could completely destroy Xiyue and his undead army. However, he absolutely could not turn against him now because only Xiyue knew the method to summon back the Lost Continent. Therefore, he had to use him to achieve his goal. He patted Xi Lu's shoulder and said, \"Brother, it's time we show Evil Lord our sincerity. Lord Evil Lord, this is my elder brother Xi Lu. He returned with me from the Divine Continent. In the great battle ten thousand years ago, Xi Lu's ancestors participated, and his ancestors came from the Lost Continent. Part of the reason for this action is to allow my elder brother to return to his homeland. With elder brother Xi Lu here, I believe you can trust us now. You must have heard of the persistence of the dwarves.\"\n\n\"Dwarves?\" Just as Xiyue was confused, a yellow light was drawn from Xi Lu and floated into Nian Bing's hand, transforming into an ancient long saber. Xi Lu, clad in black armor and wielding a black battle-ax, appeared before him in his true form. \"That's right, I am the last dwarf from the Divine Continent. Helping my homeland return is my greatest wish. There is no need for us to lie to you about this. It's not that I'm looking down on you; let alone those god-level experts, even if the Seven Dragon Kings combined their Dragon Language Magic attacks, your undead army might not be able to resist for long. If we were with the Seven Dragon Kings, there would be no need to waste our breath talking to you here.\" As he spoke, the God Extinguishing Axe in his hand slashed through the air, a black light ten feet wide shot up into the sky, reaching hundreds of feet high. The cold of the Extreme North seemed to be split by this axe. Several ice tornadoes engulfed by the axe light were instantly cut in half. The wind and snow scattered, as if separated into two worlds.\n\nSeeing this, Xiyue was greatly shocked. His battle qi could extend so far over such a large area, reaching over a hundred feet away. This dwarf alone was enough to contend with him, let alone the unfathomable Nian Bing and Hei Wu Huang. If they teamed up, his chances of success would naturally increase significantly. As Xi Lu said, if they were allied with the Seven Dragon Kings, there would be no need to come here to negotiate with him. With their cooperation, their undead army might not be able to withstand it. Thinking of this, his last trace of doubt disappeared.\n\n\"Good, since you are so sincere, then we can cooperate to bring back the prosperity of the Lost Continent. However, if, as Nian Bing said, at least ten god-level experts have also arrived on the Radiant Continent, plus the Seven Dragon Kings, I'm afraid our combined strength might not be enough to stop them from disrupting the plan. Do you have any good ideas?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"I already have some plans, but I hope to know your specific method for opening the Moudas Sealing Bottle. Only then can I cooperate with you better.\"\n\nXiyue's heart stirred, and his gaze towards Nian Bing became more meaningful. He was not foolish and naturally considered the possibility of doing the work for others. A genuine smile appeared on his face, and the dark red light returned to a dark green. \"The method to open the seal is not difficult; the key is time. I will need at least half an hour to complete the sealing spell. As for the specific circumstances when opening the seal, I am not entirely clear either. In the ancient texts I found, there is only a simple opening method. Therefore, our first priority in cooperation is to delay time.\"\n\nLooking at the smile on Xiyue's face, Nian Bing naturally understood that he would not tell him the truth. However, the half an hour he mentioned should be true, and perhaps it might even be shorter than half an hour. Thinking of this, Nian Bing smiled and said, \"Alright, then we will bet on this half an hour. At that time, Lord Evil Lord, please go ahead and cast your spell to open the seal. As for the task of resisting the Seven Dragon Kings and those divine beings, leave it to me and your undead army. We will cooperate with each other. As long as we delay for half an hour, the Lost Continent can return, and everything there will become much smoother.\"\n\nXiyue was eager for Nian Bing to say this and quickly said, \"That would be best. Then, my wife Suna and Safin will be responsible for the undead army and cooperate with your actions.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Since that's the case, we will head back first. By tomorrow at the latest, I will bring my people to the valley to be responsible for the outer defenses. Please rest assured, I will not let my people enter the basin. Before that, I hope you will have your subordinate undead carve two hundred holes, each about ten feet in diameter, on the inner ice walls of the glacier for my people to hide in.\"\n\nXiyue said, \"This is simple. Safin, you will handle this matter and also escort them out.\" Xiyue naturally had his own plans, and Nian Bing's arrival made him realize that the plans needed to change.\n\nSafin knew that after Hei Wu Huang removed his curse, he had lost Xiyue's trust. Without saying much, he took the three of them, Nian Bing and the others, to fly towards the valley outside. He stopped only after escorting them to the top of the glacier. \"Brother, thank you,\" Safin's voice was filled with emotion. If there was anyone in this world who could make him feel touched, it was probably only Hei Wu Huang.\n\nHei Wu Huang waved his hand. \"You don't need to thank me; thank Nian Bing. I will contact you again. As long as you do as I say from now on, we are still brothers, and I am still your elder brother. At least, by following me and Nian Bing, no matter how this matter is resolved, we will do our best to ensure your safety. Go, don't linger too long, lest Xiyue becomes suspicious.\"\n\nSafin smiled wryly. \"Brother has already aroused his suspicion by lifting the curse for me. Xiyue, this person will never easily trust anyone. Brother, if you really want to cooperate with him, you must be more vigilant. Even up to now, no one, including his wife, has been able to learn the secret of opening the true Moudas Sealing Bottle from him. I only vaguely heard that the opening of the seal seems to be related to his daughter. Please rest assured, I will definitely find out. I will get the three hundred ice caves you need done as soon as possible.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Safin, we don't need to dwell on past matters. Let the past be the past. Although I don't like you, Hei Wu Huang told me that you were the one among the eight Heavenly Kings of the Dark World who shed the least blood. Therefore, I believe we have an opportunity to cooperate. Can you tell me how strong Xiyue's undead army really is?\"\n\nSafin's body, composed of gray mist, rippled slightly. He sighed and said, \"I don't like you either, and I even hate you. However, I have to admit that you are already stronger than me. Seeing your strength, I truly feel that my past time was wasted. The ten thousand undead army in the ice valley are all carefully selected and integrated. Their strength is immense. I think, on the surface, among the three parts of the undead army, I control the spirits and zombies, while Xiyue's wife, Suna, controls the vampires. However, among these ten thousand undead, the strongest hundred or so, composed of the Zombie King, the Necromancer, and the Vampire King, are all under Xiyue's direct control. Those are the trump cards he uses to fight the Seven Dragon Kings. You must not underestimate these kings of the undead army. They not only have their own intelligence but were also top experts in their lifetimes. As for me, I am equivalent to at most three or four of them. If they attacked together, the Seven Dragon Kings' Dragon Language Magic might not be very effective. Xiyue is a cautious person. He wouldn't have come here so easily without some confidence. Actually, you've been deceived by him in one aspect. He had already anticipated that the Divine Continent might send people, but since he insisted on coming to this place, he must have some reliance. As far as I know, Xiyue is the most outstanding lich since the advent of necromancy. He hides himself very deeply. You should be careful yourselves and not be used and harmed by him.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"I have a sense of proportion. Alright, we'll be going now. We'll come here to set up tomorrow. I think the divine beings and the Seven Dragon Kings have likely arrived nearby. The reason they haven't made a move is that they are afraid Xiyue will escape with the Moudas Sealing Bottle, so they will certainly appear only when Xiyue begins to open the seal.\" After reminding Safin, Hei Wu Huang reintegrated into Nian Bing's body, and together with Xi Lu, they drifted away under the escort of the blizzard. Watching their retreating figures, Safin couldn't help but sigh. In two days, the great chaos would begin! No one could predict the final outcome. The original two opposing sides had evolved into three sides. He wondered if Nian Bing and Xiyue, by joining forces, could withstand the attacks of the Dragon Kings and the divine beings.\n\nActually, Safin's judgment was somewhat incorrect. The relationship between the dragon race and the divine beings was not very good, so the current situation should be four sides rather than three.\n\nThe next morning, Nian Bing arrived inside the glacier with his subordinates. Although the elites of the Blood Lion Sect had trained in the cold snow mountains for over two months, it was much colder here compared to the snow mountains. Fortunately, they had drunk a large amount of iron-line snake gall bladder fluid, making their physiques much stronger than before. Coupled with the cold-resistant clothing Nian Bing had prepared for them beforehand, they could barely endure it.\n\nSix hundred people were divided among two hundred caves, with three people per group. Their God Slaying Crossbows were placed at the cave entrances. After simple modifications to the ice caves according to the attack formations required by the God Slaying Crossbows, they rested inside the ice caves. Nian Bing delivered the prepared warming supplies to each ice cave, along with food. His preparations were complete.",

    "content": "At this time, the only one not inside Ice Valley was Miao Miao. Even Xi Lu didn't know where Nian Bing had sent Miao Miao.\n\nXie Yue had not appeared, nor had he paid attention to what Nian Bing and his subordinates had done. However, Nian Bing knew that Xie Yue must be aware of what he had done. Nian Bing also had his own plans. No matter what contingency Xie Yue had prepared, the most important thing for him was to withstand the attacks of the Gods and the Seven Dragon Kings. As for what would happen during Xie Yue's summoning, he would have to rely on himself. With the God-Slaying Crossbows cooperating with the zombie army, he didn't have much to worry about. The two hundred God-Slaying Crossbows' job was to slow down the Gods' attacks. Now, the most important thing for Nian Bing was to grasp the timing of Xie Yue's summoning, as only then could he achieve his goal. He and Xi Lu would become the final decisive force, and now there was also Sa Fen. At a critical moment, with the Black Martial Emperor's effect, he should help their side.\n\nIn the cold canyon, under a gloomy sky, the biting cold made even Nian Bing feel uncomfortable. He and Xi Lu were both meditating in an ice cave; the decisive moment was approaching. When night fell, the temperature inside Ice Valley began to drop continuously and at an extremely rapid pace. If Nian Bing hadn't prepared his subordinates beforehand, they would likely be unable to withstand such cold by now. The atmosphere in Ice Valley was very solemn. Time passed continuously, and the undead army, which did not fear the cold, began to move in an orderly fashion. Around the summit of Ice Valley, zombies holding spears patrolled everywhere. Undead spirits and vampires responsible for reconnaissance drifted in the air. Their blood was cold, and an aura of slaughter and terror filled Ice Valley. At this moment, it could completely be called the Valley of Death.\n\nYou You wore a long black dress, her hair neatly spread down her back, and a black pearl necklace around her neck, which made her look even more radiant. However, her originally large eyes were filled with a deathly silence. Standing with her father beside the ice cave in the center of Ice Valley, from which extreme cold continued to emanate, the sinister aura grew stronger. Xie Yue enveloped himself and his daughter with the green light around him. The stronger this extreme yin energy became, the greater the benefit to him. The dense, dark green light continuously radiated outwards. Every fluctuation not only dispelled the surrounding cold but also absorbed some of the sinister energy to replenish himself.\n\n\"You You, have you memorized the incantation I told you?\" Xie Yue asked in a low voice.\n\nYou You didn't speak, merely nodding silently.\n\nXie Yue sighed and said, \"Daughter, don't blame your father for being cruel. If there were any other way, I would never choose this. Father promises you, if you can remain safe after completing the incantation this time, no matter what you want to do in the future, Father will not stop you. Even if you want to be with Ping Chao, Father will fulfill your wish.\"\n\nYou You said calmly, \"I understand the meaning of the word 'sacrifice.' I am the sacrificial offering. Father, you don't need to say anymore. I understand everything, and I will never be a burden to you. My life was given by you in the first place, so it's nothing to return it to you now. However, you must remember what you promised me. No matter what, you must save Brother Ping Chao's life and let him leave after this is over.\"\n\nXie Yue nodded silently and said, \"Don't worry. Although I'm not a trustworthy person, I will abide by the incantations of the dark world. The evil energy has already begun to surge. As soon as the extreme yin energy appears, it will be time for us to act.\"\n\nYou You said nothing further, slowly closing her eyes. Two crystal tears fell from her face. Although she was protected by Xie Yue's energy, when the tears fell, they still condensed into two clean ice crystals, shattering on the ground.\n\nWhether it was Nian Bing or Xie Yue, at this moment, they were both waiting, waiting for the final moment to arrive.\n\nThe sky gradually turned from pitch dark to bright. The dark clouds above Ice Valley hid the sun from everyone's sight, but the dawn before the storm still appeared. At this instant, the entire Ice Valley seemed to have completely turned into a gray world. The first to act was not Xie Yue, who was guarding the extreme yin eye, but Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing did not expect this extreme evil energy to be so domineering. When he sensed the instant change, without any hesitation, he released his Heavenly Eye Domain. Seven-colored light completely enveloped the ice caves where all his subordinates were located. In that pure magical elemental energy, he could barely isolate the evil energy. Nian Bing gasped. He knew that if his actions had been even a little slower, anyone below the Martial Saint realm among his subordinates would have lost some of their combat power. Furthermore, once contaminated by the sinister energy, it would cause irreversible damage to their bodies.\n\nAt the same time as Nian Bing activated his Heavenly Eye Domain, Xie Yue also moved. Under Nian Bing's mental gaze, he waved his sleeve, and seven black lights instantly appeared, landing steadily around the cave entrance. These were the seven bottles of Moordas' Seal. As soon as the seven black bottles appeared, they were stained with the extreme yin and evil energy, and a faint golden light emanated from the mouths of the bottles.\n\nXie Yue let out a low roar, his eyes instantly turning blood red. He bit his middle finger and flicked seven drops of green blood, imprinting them on the center of the seven bottles. Immediately, the golden light surged. It first condensed together in the air, and then this point of golden light rapidly expanded, forming a golden pillar one *zhang* in diameter that shot up into the sky. A low humming sound, like a Buddhist chant, echoed. Every nerve of Xie Yue was tense at this moment; the critical juncture was finally about to arrive.\n\nYou You stood up straight. At this time, a strange blood-colored pattern had appeared on her forehead, emitting a dark red glow. Without waiting for Xie Yue's command, she raised her foot and stepped into the golden light, simultaneously moving towards the extreme evil eye.\n\n\"No, You You, don't!\" a sharp cry sounded, and a figure flashed forward like lightning.\n\nA blood-red light filled with evil energy flashed in Xie Yue's eyes. He raised his hand and sent out a blast of red light, instantly blasting the figure away.\n\nYou You's body trembled. She retracted her outstretched right foot, and her deathly silent eyes were filled with emotion at this moment. She looked back at the body that had been blasted away.\n\nXie Yue said urgently, \"Quick, don't waste time. Don't worry, he won't be in any danger. I promised you.\"\n\nYou You glanced deeply at her father, then in the direction where Ping Chao had been sent flying. She knew that at this time, Xie Yue would not lie to her. Without further hesitation, she took back her step and finally stepped forward. When her graceful figure and body entered the hazy golden light, she did not fall into the ice eye. Instead, she floated up within the golden light, hovering quietly in the center of the seven Moordas' Seal bottles, about half a *zhang* from the ground. Her hands formed claws, one above the other, positioned evenly in front of her chest. Tears fell from her eyes once again, not tears of sadness, but tears of despair.\n\nJust as You You entered the golden light, the anomaly Xie Yue had been guarding against finally occurred. Two streams of energy, one green and one yellow, shot out from the left side of Ice Valley. The battle energy exploded in the air, scattering sparks of light. Over a dozen figures appeared in mid-air. An intangible pressure emanated from them, so strong that even the extreme evil yin energy could not approach.\n\nHundreds of spears were hurled from the hands of the zombies. The spears carried a ghastly green light. The yellow-green light spots falling from the sky, simultaneously with the throwing of the spears, burst into a faint halo, appearing like a pale green veil that instantly diffused beneath the dozen figures. However, this faint light layer, as it drifted, blocked the thrown spears. No, to be precise, it shattered them.\n\nThe spears, upon contact with the blue-green light, vanished into thin air without leaving a trace. The immense pressure expanded even further, blocking the approaching undead spirits. A low voice rang out, \"Evil can never triumph over justice. By defying the will of God, death will appear before you. Undead in the darkness, will you not end your childish thoughts? Must you only repent when you have nowhere to be buried?\"\n\nAlthough Nian Bing was far from the sudden appearance of these individuals, his spirit couldn't help but tremble when he heard the voice. This was precisely the voice of the Holy Master. In mid-air, the pure white light enveloped the Holy Master's soaring figure. Including the Holy Master, there were a total of eleven people. Although the light around the Holy Master's body was not the strongest, he occupied the central position. Every word he spoke carried a pure aura, causing the surrounding undead spirits to retreat constantly. The Holy Master's divine aura was the nemesis of this undead army!\n\nThe Gods had finally appeared, one more than Nian Bing had expected. Judging by the energy emanating from them, they were within Nian Bing's expectations. If Xilun had not died at their hands, he would have been considered a strong individual among this group. There were a total of eleven people, and at least seven of them had reached the thirteenth rank. Such a powerful combination was understandable why they dared to face an army of ten thousand undead in this manner.\n\nXie Yue seemed to ignore their words and made no move. His hands continuously changed various hand seals, and streams of dark red light were accurately injected into each Moordas' Seal bottle, causing the golden light emanating from the seven bottles to gradually blend with some dark red color.\n\nYou You also seemed unaware of everything happening outside. She finally began to chant her incantation, looking up at the sky, her hands still in the same position. A blood-red point of light appeared between her claws. Her voice during the chanting was very low, but also very calm and very slow. Every word she uttered was exceptionally clear: \"Supre—me—Lord—of—Divine—Flame—King—Controller—of—the—Triangular—Formation—please—listen—to—my—prayer—\"\n\nAlthough she spoke each word very slowly, with every word she uttered, her face became paler, and the blood-red light between her claws became stronger. A faint black mist surrounded her body, and the blood-red symbol on her forehead became even clearer. Enveloped by the extreme yin energy, at this moment, she looked like a queen, a queen in the darkness.\n\nYou You's chanting was so clear that Xie Yue could hear it, Nian Bing could hear it, and the eleven Gods led by the Holy Master could naturally hear it. When she had only chanted the fifth word, the Holy Master raised his right hand, and all eleven Gods attacked simultaneously. Without exception, they all used battle energy. Red, blue, yellow, green, silver, white, black – battle energy of every attribute existed among these Gods. Their movements were extremely fast, so fast that even Nian Bing felt exceptionally surprised. The battle energy lights did not spread over a large area, but each blast of battle energy left long gouges. Battle energy crisscrossed the sky, and the undead spirits surrounding the Gods were instantly driven away by the Holy Master's divine aura. The zombies that frantically charged towards them were pulverized in the battle energy before they even had a chance to fall.\n\nAnd just as the Gods' first wave of attacks began, Nian Bing also gave his signal. At this moment, although he respected the Holy Master, he could not hesitate in the slightest. The power of the Gods, although as he had predicted, the simultaneous actions of eleven experts at the twelfth and thirteenth ranks still shocked him greatly. Moreover, the Seven Dragon Kings had not yet appeared. If these Gods were allowed to charge into Ice Valley, they could interrupt You You's ritual at any time.\n\nWhen You You began to chant the incantation and float in the golden light, Nian Bing realized that he had seen this girl before. Looking at her slightly pale pretty face, Nian Bing felt a sense of unease. However, at this point, there was no time for him to hesitate. The Gods in the sky not only put great pressure on Xie Yue but also on him.\n\nNian Bing waved his hand. Just as the eleven Gods' first wave of attacks had cleared all the zombies on one side of Ice Valley, he waved his hand.\n\nOne hundred red phantoms silently emerged. Just as the eleven Gods simultaneously launched their attack, caught between their old strength dissipating and new strength not yet generated, these one hundred phantom-like lights appeared. The range did not spread out; they completely shot towards the eleven Gods in the air. As the first attack, Nian Bing had not added any techniques to his plan. Because he knew that the Gods were extremely proud, and they would not easily dodge when facing enemies, therefore, this first wave of attack was also the most effective. A total of one hundred fire-elemental God-Slaying Arrows appeared silently.\n\nThe dark red light shadows did not give the Gods much time to react. Among the eleven Gods, even the Holy Master did not take much precaution. Seven of them ignored these red lights and concentrated their battle energy to prepare for their next attack. Only four faintly sensed that something was wrong and unleashed the energy they had just generated with all their might.",

    "content": "An earth-shattering scene unfolded. Above the ice valley filled with sinister energy, the sky instantly turned red. A deafening roar accompanied the shattering of the yellow-green barrier beneath the gods, as just five God-Slaying Arrows obliterated their defensive barrier. The remaining ninety-five arrows, without pause, arrived before the gods the moment the barrier broke.\n\nThe Divine Continent was a place rife with danger. Everyone there had to constantly guard against attacks from magical beasts and their own kind. Though the gods were arrogant, they were also highly vigilant. When the violent explosion sounded and the sense of danger encroached, they reacted in an instant, making the fastest possible response. No one could describe the resplendent scene: the sky was adorned with exceptionally brilliant fireworks, with milky white light spreading instantly, dominated by gold, red, blue, and green light, erupting into a dazzling burst.\n\nHowever, no matter how brilliant these lights were, they couldn't compare to the red light that blotted out the sun and obscured the sky. The fiery aura instantly caused the temperature within the entire ice valley to rise dramatically. On the gods' side, one hundred zhang of the three-hundred-zhang-tall ice valley vanished, and all the gods were, without exception, blasted a thousand zhang away by the immense shockwave.\n\nBelow, Xie Yue's expression changed. The cold in the ice valley instantly weakened, but the sinister energy remained unaffected. However, the scene just now left him dumbfounded. He knew who was responsible, but he never imagined that the help Nian Bing could provide would be so formidable. Seeing this, he couldn't help but be somewhat lost in thought.\n\nOriginally, when the eleven gods appeared, his heart had sunk. Nian Bing had told him the number of gods, but he hadn't fully believed it. It wasn't until the gods launched their first wave of attacks that thousands of zombies were easily destroyed in that single strike that he realized his estimation was mistaken. But before he could regret it, Nian Bing had already delivered a great gift. Xie Yue saw the red light, the sky full of red light, and the exploding energy was the most brilliant sight he had ever witnessed. He knew he was wrong; he had underestimated Nian Bing far too much. With an attack of this magnitude, Xie Yue, at this moment, truly recognized Nian Bing, because he knew that if this attack had been directed at him, he would have had no chance at all. Raising his head, Xie Yue looked at his daughter. The golden light of the Muodas Seal Bottle still existed, unaffected by the red light in the sky, and You You's first incantation had just finished as she began her second. Before dawn today, apart from Xie Yue himself, not even Sina knew that the true officiant of this ritual to open the Muodas Seal Bottle was You You, as an offering!\n\nYou You's voice was unusually calm. After completing the first incantation, the ball of blood-red light between her claws had expanded considerably, growing from a single drop to a small cluster. Her face grew paler, but the black airflow around her body became more condensed. Her eyes had turned blood-red at this moment, a blood-red light filled with the aura of death. The girl, who had transformed into the Dark Queen, began her second incantation, also commencing her process as a sacrifice, \"Most noble King of Demonic Flames, ruler of the four-cornered array, please answer my plea...\"\n\nYou You's voice remained low and clear, transmitting in all directions. However, compared to when they heard her first incantation, the eleven gods' feelings had completely changed. When they heard You You's first incantation, they had been very relaxed. They had been on the Yangguang Continent for some time, and regardless of the humans they faced, their outcome had always been to conquer all and be victorious in all battles. They had not encountered any power that could contend with them on this continent. Although they didn't know why they had lost two companions, given their cold disposition, what did the life or death of their companions matter? Before coming here, only the Holy Master had vaguely sensed that retrieving the Muodas Seal Bottle this time would not be simple. Unfortunately, no one agreed with his thoughts.\n\nUpon hearing the incantation for the ritual, they knew the ritual could no longer be stopped, so they appeared. The first wave of attacks, the zombies in their eyes like ants, was a large portion of them destroyed. Just as their arrogance was about to swell, a nearly devastating blow suddenly appeared.\n\nThe unprecedented intense vibration struck terror into the hearts of the eleven gods. They suddenly realized how close they were to death. In that instant, they almost simultaneously unleashed their strongest potential. Six of the gods, who had already opened their acupuncture points, instantly expanded their defenses to the maximum. To save their lives, they disregarded everything else. Below, the brilliant lights Nian Bing saw were not entirely their battle qi; most of them were protective artifacts they had refined on the Divine Continent.\n\nA thousand zhang away, the eleven gods almost simultaneously spat blood. According to their reaction speed and strength, they had suffered injuries of varying degrees. But what pained them the most was the loss of their protective artifacts. At least half of the treasures used for defense had released their full energy, and most of them were destroyed by the violent bombardment. Waves of scorching airflow surged madly towards their bodies. If they had not lived under the harsh environment of the Divine Continent, even just that scorching, frenzied fire-elemental aura would have rendered them incapable of fighting.\n\nCompared to the gods' shock, Nian Bing frowned. He was not satisfied with the outcome before him. He knew the attack power of the God-Slaying Crossbow only too well. It wasn't that he didn't want to unleash two hundred arrows at once, but with the gods standing so densely packed earlier, if all two hundred God-Slaying Arrows were fired, some of their energy would have been canceled out in the collision, and the effect might not have been better than one hundred God-Slaying Arrows. In Nian Bing's original prediction, these one hundred God-Slaying Arrows were the most crucial component of his entire plan. By exploiting the gods' arrogance, this was the only opportunity, and only this once, to make them truly receive the attack of the God-Slaying Arrows head-on. He thought this wave of attacks would at least kill the weaker gods among them with the God-Slaying Arrows. However, things did not go as planned. Protected by the gods' extraordinary will to survive and their protective artifacts, not a single god suffered a fatal wound.\n\nFrom afar, the gods a thousand zhang away were in an extremely sorry state. None of them had their clothes neatly arranged, and some even had their bodies turned black as if carbonized. However, this did not ease Nian Bing's mood; instead, it became heavier. He knew that the gods' impending retaliation could only be dealt with by the number of God-Slaying Arrows. And it was at this moment that both Nian Bing and the gods heard You You's second incantation.\n\nWhat just attacked us? This was the common question in all the gods' hearts. They cherished their lives greatly, so among the eleven people a thousand zhang away, only the Holy Master was rushing back. The other ten gods floated in mid-air, supporting their bodies with battle qi, treating their injuries while carefully observing the situation in the ice valley. They were unwilling to gamble with their lives. But just as the gods were preparing to wait further, a voice echoed in their ears, and after hearing this voice, the light in each god's eyes changed slightly. The ten did not hesitate any longer and followed the Holy Master, charging forward.\n\nYou You's second incantation continued to be chanted at a slow pace, and at this time, her graceful, slender figure was trembling continuously. \"It's them, it's them. Brother Nian Bing, you must help me kill them. It was them who killed my parents! The one in front isn't here, but the ones behind have all appeared in our homeland.\"\n\nNian Bing glanced back at Mao Mao, his gentle gaze filled with comfort. He said calmly, \"Mao Mao, your enemy is my brother's enemy. As long as I can do it, today will be the day of our revenge.\" His voice was not loud, but every word was firm and powerful. Listening to Nian Bing's promise, Mao Mao's excitement gradually subsided. Looking at the tall figure beside her, she took a deep breath. She knew that she could never block Brother Nian Bing from moving forward.\n\nNian Bing moved at this time. Blue airflow supported his body as he floated out. The ice cave, originally protected by his Heavenly Eye domain, now had a layer of battle qi covering its first entrance. With Nian Bing's warning, and being prepared, it was not so easy for the sinister energy to invade when defended by battle qi.\n\nIn just a few flashes, Nian Bing had already arrived in mid-air. The blizzard made his speed incredibly erratic. Floating in mid-air, Nian Bing directly met the Holy Master. The Holy Master looked somewhat strange at this time, his expression not good. Anyone who had just been bombarded by the God-Slaying Arrows would likely not have a good expression.\n\n\"It's you?\" A hint of doubt appeared in the Holy Master's eyes.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said, \"Isn't it me? Senior Holy Master, we meet again. However, this time, I'm afraid we are enemies rather than friends! Do you really have to prevent this ritual from being completed?\"\n\nThe look of surprise in the Holy Master's eyes disappeared before the other gods arrived. He said coldly, \"This is our mission. Do you want to see a scene of widespread destruction? The Muodas Seal Bottle cannot be opened, otherwise, you should be very clear of the consequences.\"\n\nNian Bing said leisurely, \"I am very clear, of course, but I still wish for the Lost Continent to return. If the Muodas Seal Bottle is not opened, will you gods not cause widespread destruction? I wonder if Senior Holy Master has any feelings about returning to the Yangguang Continent this time. I think you must. Compared to the Divine Continent, this place is paradise. I wonder how long the seals on the Divine Continent can hold out before the gods there return from hell to paradise?\"\n\nThe Holy Master's expression changed slightly. He understood the meaning behind Nian Bing's words. His gaze became somewhat complex, but at this moment, he had no other choice. Before he could speak, a tall, middle-aged man emanating a black aura at his side flashed forward and stood before the Holy Master. He looked at Nian Bing with disdain, \"Human, you are also a running dog of the undead. Since that is the case, you should go to hell. Everyone, hurry up, do not defy God's will. Spread out and charge, beware of sneak attacks.\" This man in black seemed to have greater prestige among the gods than the Holy Master. Under his command, all the gods except the Holy Master instantly separated and charged downwards from different directions.\n\nNian Bing did not move, but his mental power was always connected to his subordinates.\n\nA great net, woven with red and blue, appeared at this moment, and it appeared at the ice walls on the three sides other than where the gods appeared. The two hundred God-Slaying Arrows were not aimed at the gods. Although the shooting speed of the God-Slaying Arrows was as fast as illusions, Nian Bing was very clear that at this speed alone, it could not stop experts above the twelfth rank, because at the twelfth rank and above, warriors could break through the limits of speed and reach another realm. Nian Bing himself also possessed this speed, so he naturally knew what methods to use under what circumstances.\n\nThe moment the great net woven with red and blue appeared, Nian Bing's body disappeared, enveloped in a silver light. For him, every second that could be delayed was a victory. With a step back and forth, although it was only a brief exchange with the Holy Master, a few seconds were still enough to achieve a delay.\n\nWhen Nian Bing reappeared, he had once again come to Mao Mao's side, and that great net woven with red and blue had already exploded. Under Nian Bing's mental control, regardless of whether it was ice or fire, the magical energy in each God-Slaying Arrow was the same, and all possessed his inherent dual nature of ice and fire. And what would happen if fifty fire-elemental God-Slaying Arrows and fifty ice-elemental God-Slaying Arrows collided in mid-air at the same instant? Perhaps only Nian Bing could imagine it.\n\nTwo God-Slaying Arrows, two diametrically opposed attributes, in a violent collision, could unleash energy far more terrifying than pre-fused ice-and-fire magic. And it was at this moment that Nian Bing unleashed this terrifying attack.",

    "title": "Chapter 220: The End of the Divine Arrow (Part 2)",
    "content": "The violent roar was louder than before.\n\nThis was because\n\na simultaneous detonation of ice and fire.\n\nThat immense power\n\ninstantly formed a massive explosion,\n\nencompassing every corner within thousands of feet above the Ice Valley.\n\nThe immense explosive force was condensed and unmoving.\n\nThe explosive effect generated at that moment,\n\neven if ten Rank 13 experts combined their forces,\n\nthe power would be no more than this.\n\nThe large-area explosion naturally could not injure the gods as before,\n\nnor could it bring them such a great impact.\n\nBut\n\nmerely forcing them back\n\nwas enough. The power of Rank 9 God-Slaying Arrows colliding, amplified by the unity of ice and fire, reached Rank 11. What is Rank 11? It's a Forbidden Curse! The power of fifty Forbidden Curses detonating simultaneously is unimaginable, not to mention that such an explosion was limited to the center above the Ice Valley. This violent explosion caused the various magic elements in the air to instantly become rampant, and a magic storm centered on ice and fire continued to rage. As the gods were sent flying back, they couldn't help but have a question: Is this still the Light Continent? Have they returned to the Divine Continent?\n\nAlas, for those remaining zombies scattered on the other sides of the Ice Valley's summit, in the face of such an explosion, they had almost no suspense. Just like the gods when they first appeared, they turned into dust, and the summit of the Ice Valley instantly became pure white. However, the rampant magic elements made the gods' expressions extremely grim. Although they were forced to retreat, their anger reached its peak. At this very moment, a silent figure quietly appeared behind the retreating gods. This figure had only one target: a Rank 12 god, who could barely be called a demigod. He was the unluckiest fellow during the God-Slaying Arrow attack, suffering the most severe injuries. With the second batch of explosions, he was like a startled bird, the first to retreat. Flying with battle qi was inherently a tiring matter. Such a large-scale magic explosion, despite their strong power, they were all warriors. Warriors facing such a direct magical assault would suffer unbearable damage, so he was the first to retreat.\n\nWhen this unlucky god felt a spatial fluctuation behind him, he felt a chilling coldness. The next moment, he saw a headless body floating and tumbling in the air. Immediately after, the body vanished into thin air, silently disappearing without a trace. The last sensation of his life was entering an infinite darkness, where he discovered that death was not so terrifying.\n\nThe silver light flashed again, and the dark figure disappeared along with fan-like black light. At this time, the other gods noticed something was wrong behind them, but eleven of them had become ten.\n\nAlmost all the gods thought that this must have been done by Nian Bing, but amidst the violent shock just now, they really had no way to break through. With the rampant magic raging, coupled with the immense explosive force, they were still human, not true gods, and their endurance had limits. The chained combination of fifty Forbidden Curses was something they could not break through. Perhaps this was temporary, but for now, they had no way.\n\nJust as all the gods were vigilant and observing their surroundings, they noticed that You You's second incantation had finished. The entire space was in a brief calm. Apart from the biting cold wind and the howling from the magic element explosion, there was no human sound.\n\nSilence, deathly silence.\n\nYou You floated in mid-air, clearly feeling an invisible energy continuously pouring into her body. This energy seemed to be from the seven bottles of Mo Ordus' Seal, and although these energies were continuously injected into her body, they were also constantly extracting something from her body. That indescribable feeling made You You's sorrow gradually disappear. The surrounding world seemed to become clearer. She could clearly see Nian Bing's appearance, clearly see Nian Bing commanding his subordinates to force back the gods with the God-Slaying Arrow net, and all this did not bring her any shock. At this moment, she could even clearly see the distance and relationship between the agitated magic elements in the air. This was a miraculous feeling. Although she felt her body was weakened, with every breath, she saw the clear world before her becoming somewhat hazy. She seemed to see another world, a world full of green.\n\nYou You did not pause. She naturally did not know what would happen next, nor did she want to know what would happen next. However, her incantation continued. With Nian Bing's obstruction and help, she continued to chant the incantation her father had taught her.\n\n\"Great King of Netherflame, ruler of the Five-Pointed Star Array, please grant my wish—\"\n\nXie Yue's heart was filled with tension and excitement. Watching his daughter chant the incantation word by word, he knew his long-held dream was getting closer and closer. With the completion of each word in the incantation, he would be one step closer to becoming the King of the Lost Continent. However, he was also a little scared now. The God-Slaying Arrows had left a very deep impression on him. The volley of God-Slaying Arrows could explode in the air and repel all eleven gods. His own valley could also be pierced. With just one round of such power, it was likely that his undead army in the valley, except for a few strong individuals, would not be left. Although he was tense and excited now, he had no doubts about Nian Bing. He knew that if that young man wanted to do anything to him, he would never have waited until now, let alone become enemies with the gods, or even kill a god. Xie Yue was waiting, and at the same time, he was making arrangements. How could his years of hope be protected merely by relying on these undead armies?\n\nThe voice of the third incantation was slower than the previous two. At this time, the red ball flashing with blood light between You You's claws had grown a little larger. Although it was only a little, You You's aura had become different. Nian Bing felt a pure death power from her, while her own life force was rapidly draining. The golden light emitted by Mo Ordus' Seal made Nian Bing feel very strange. Even his Heavenly Eye domain could not probe the properties within the golden light. It was like the gray energy that Oscar had exuded when he first appeared, elusive. The golden light before him had an eerie aura in its flickering, and those auras seemed to be converging towards You You's body.\n\nYou You at this moment seemed to be a bit larger than usual, her body volume had increased. If one looked closely, they would find that it was not her true body that had grown, but the black aura around her body had taken on the exact shape of her body, unlike the oval shape when ordinary people emit energy. In the black radiance, the blood-red symbol between her eyebrows was exceptionally clear, and the red light in her eyes had become even more dazzling. Her claws were held parallel in front of her chest, and You You's aura fluctuations remained stable. However, perhaps because the black radiance around her body was too strong, the original golden-red radiance emitted by Mo Ordus' Seal now had a few black halos.\n\nNian Bing naturally saw You You's change, but he was now too busy to care when You You's incantation would be completed, because he saw ten furious gods. After two consecutive setbacks, the gods' auras had changed. The energy around their bodies was fluctuating unstably. Nian Bing could even see the acupoints on their bodies emitting different lights, bringing them more immense energy. The gods did not approach again, but the energy they were gathering was growing larger and larger.\n\nWhat do these fellows want to do? Nian Bing's doubts grew. He had never underestimated the gods. Facing so many experts, he knew that if he was not careful, he would lose everything. Of course, Nian Bing would not let his allies suffer too much. He knew that Xie Yue was behind him. If he could not resist, he would leave the threat to Xie Yue to handle.\n\nThe gods were floating there. Flying with battle qi was very energy-consuming, but most of them had opened their Heavenly Meridians, and with the constant replenishment of innate energy from the air, supporting flight was not very difficult.\n\nThe Holy Master's voice was a little low: \"Do we really have to do that?\"\n\nThe black-clothed man who had previously berated Nian Bing snorted and said, \"Of course. Do you have a better way? Only by completely destroying this place can we achieve our goal. Did you see those arrows just now? Can you be sure how many more there are? As long as those arrows exist, we can't get in at all. The archers should be hidden on the ice walls. I really don't understand when such powerful magic archers appeared on the Light Continent. If they all attacked, we might not fare well either. Therefore, destroying this place now is the best way.\"\n\nThe Holy Master frowned: \"This Ice Valley is not simple. To seal the Eye of Absolute Cold and Yin within it must mean it has some special features. Once we destroy this place, the cold air will likely flow out, possibly affecting the climate of the Light Continent, causing suffering to countless ordinary humans. Must we really do this?\" The black-clothed man disdainfully said, \"Sentimental, haven't you seen that one of our companions is already dead? We don't want to be the next. To complete the orders from above, we must do this. If you are unwilling, then get out of the way, and we will handle it. Brothers, let us collapse this Ice Valley and see if any magic archers can stop our progress.\" They did not see what attacked them during the first wave, but when the blue net appeared in the second wave, they saw the God-Slaying Arrows. After all, God-Slaying Arrows were not as awe-inspiring as a large number of experts. Seeing that they were just arrows, their mood had relaxed considerably. However, facing the power of the God-Slaying Arrows, they now had no other way. Not being able to break through meant that You You's incantation would continue to be completed, and their mission would be in vain, which was something they could not and would not want to see.\n\nNine balls of battle qi rose with dazzling brilliance as they condensed. That was no longer just the gods' own battle qi, but also the energy they condensed through their Heavenly Meridians or middle acupoints. Whether it was innate energy or compressed battle qi, it possessed terrifying offensive power. Although the Ice Valley was not small in area, the black-clothed man's claim to destroy it was not boastful. Nine gods working together could absolutely achieve this.\n\nWhen Nian Bing saw the immense energy beginning to condense, his expression had already changed. His subordinates were hidden within the ice walls, and the God-Slaying Arrows were powerless to stop such an attack. The only thing he could rely on now was himself. But that was nine gods!\n\nNian Bing had thought of the same problem as the Holy Master. The cold air within the Ice Valley was so low. Once it escaped the restrictions of the Ice Valley, his elite Blood Lion Cult subordinates would be the first to suffer. His preparations were not insufficient, but Nian Bing had not expected the gods to use such an extreme method. Xie Yue naturally wouldn't care about this method, but Nian Bing couldn't ignore it. Tie also wanted his subordinates to mount the God-Slaying Ballistas on the surrounding ice valleys, but although the Blood Lion Cult elites were strong, they were not undead after all. Under such sinister and severe cold, their bodies could not withstand it. Even if they were mounted, they would likely have no offensive power.\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing whispered a few words into Mao Mao's ear and then rushed out without hesitation. With a teleportation, he had already arrived outside the Ice Valley.\n\nSeeing the gods condensing energy hundreds of feet away, Nian Bing moved.\n\nSeven-colored magic power simultaneously converged towards his body from the surroundings. His mid-stage Heavenly Meridians operated at full capacity. Under the expanded seven-colored light, seven faint figures appeared gracefully, accompanied by seven divine blades, surrounding Nian Bing like stars embracing the moon. At this moment, Nian Bing wished he could restore his mental power to a physical attack. Although the gods before him were strong, they were far inferior to the true gods on the Divine Continent. Even the God of Order had once faltered for a moment due to his physical mental attack. Dealing with these gods could potentially result in a few instant kills, making what he had to face much easier.",

    "content": "可惜，希望終究不是現實，該面對的總是自己去面對，看來，想要對付這些傢伙，自己只能用猥瑣一些的辦法了。臉上流露出一絲怪異的笑容，念冰的身體消失了，只是一瞬間，他又回到了原位，彷彿一直都在那裡似的，但他手中，卻多了幾十枝誅神箭。誅神箭他一共製作了兩千支，每一架誅神弩配十枝，現在已經用掉了二百枝。雖然誅神弩無法到外面揮威力，但是，卻並不代表只能用誅神弩射。譬如舄鹵口中的怪物念冰，就有著他自己的辦法，現在，誅神箭在念冰手中，就像是一個個九階的魔法捲軸一般。\n\n誅神箭本身是有限制的，在製作魔法捲軸來說，即便是以念冰現在的精神力，想製造出過八階的魔法捲軸也非常困難，誅神箭之所以能夠成功，主要得益於誅神弩彈出時的速度，念冰在運用了種種技巧試驗後，憑藉瞬間碰撞時的速度才能揮出寶石儲存的爆炸力。而如果誅神箭直接使用，魔法是無法揮的，所以，一般來說，誅神箭想要揮最大效果，必須要有誅神弩。念冰現在要用誅神箭，自身付出的代價也不小，他必須要以自己的魔法力引動才可以。付出的魔法力之多，也要相當於八階魔法，但好處就是，在他的精神力和魔法力催動下，可以同時揮出這些誅神箭的效果。雖然不可能使用太多，但總能在瞬間爆出他需要的威力。\n\n幾十枝誅神箭，連珠而出，一根接一根，在空中劃出一道直線，一紅一藍。再一紅一藍，緊密相連，速度並不快。但眨眼間卻已經來到神人們面前。一朵朵絢麗的紅藍兩色煙花在神人們面前爆開了。\n\n毀滅面積如此之大的冰谷，即便神人們的實力極強，也需要凝聚外界的大師先天之氣才有可能做到，念冰的突然出現，正在不斷凝聚能量的九名神人中頓時分出一人，一拳接一拳的迎上了念冰射出的誅神箭，誅神箭彷彿長了眼睛一般，在距離眾神人還有一丈左右的距離時，前面的紅色誅神箭突然停頓一下。後面的藍色誅神箭頓時撞上。轟然巨響中，爆出一團紅藍色的光芒，強大的衝擊力直接迎向神人的拳頭。\n\n誅神箭接連不斷的轟擊，使神人們面前頓時被一團團紅藍色的光芒所籠罩，雖然分出迎擊的神人實力相當強大，但面對接連不斷的禁咒級別攻擊，應付起來還是有些吃力，只能勉強護住己方陣營，而由於砲火中充滿了狂暴的魔法元素，是所有神人的六感無法探知到前方的一切。當然，他們並不會因此而改變自己的初衷，當所有神人蓄力完畢的剎那，他們同時向冰谷方向發出了自己的合力一擊。\n\n在神人們的意念中，就算念冰再強大，他也不可能抵擋住眾多神人的合力攻擊，如果他適時閃避，那是他的幸運。否則，就會與冰谷一起，成為歷史的塵埃。\n\n九名神人除了那名對付念冰的那位以外，其餘八人合力合擊是極為可怕的，雖然一旁的聖師並不贊同他們這樣做，但在這個時候也不會去阻止他們。畢竟，這確實是一個容易攻入冰谷、化解默奧達斯封印之瓶揭開封印的辦法。\n\n奇異的一幕在此時發生了，八道不同顏色的光芒在空中凝聚成一股巨大的死亡光柱，原本在神人們面前狂暴無比的冰、火兩種元素，在這八道凝聚了神人們鬥氣和先天之氣的全力一擊下瞬間消失，眼前的一切又恢復清晰起來，包括聖師在內，神人們都看到了一幕奇異的景象，那是一面鏡子，一面巨大的鏡子，鏡子的直徑比他們全力一擊還要大上幾分，這面似乎是由冰組成的鏡子呈現出藍黑色，中間閃爍著一圈又一圈的銀色光暈。\n\n這是什麼？神人們也不知道，雖然他們對魔法多少都有些認識，但眼前這怪異的藍黑色鏡子超出了他們所有人的認知範圍，但是，他們對自己的攻擊實力還是非常有信心的，畢竟，就算是主神級別的絕頂高手，也不可能從正面抵擋他們全力的一擊。\n\n但就在這時，神人們卻發現那面鏡子變得傾斜了起來，鏡子向上向後仰起，整面鏡子朝念冰的方向呈四十五度角迎上了他們的轟擊，那一圈圈銀色的光暈突然變得強烈起來，當與那鏡子碰撞的瞬間，鏡子表面似乎變得異常光滑，竟然將那足以毀滅整個冰谷的龐大能量朝空中反射而去。\n\n八股合一的巨大能量斜斜的朝空中射去，原本佈滿陰雲的天空頓時如同沸水入雪一般，迅速的消融著。不算很強烈的陽光從天空灑落，大片的陰雲迅速消失著，陽光普照大地，溫暖悄然降臨，化解了幾分地面的寒氣。\n\n神人們都愣住了，他們簡直無法相信自己的眼睛，更無法相信眼前的一切是真實的。八名神級高手全力一擊，其中不乏十三階的高手，積蓄半天能量全力一擊竟然被如此輕鬆的化解了。這是他們怎麼也不願意承認的事實。\n\n巨大的冰鏡在反射了最後一絲能量後也失去了它的光彩，一道道裂痕呈現在眾神人面前，而此時，他們腳下已經多了一頭神龍，一頭通體閃爍著灰晶色的神龍。坐在神龍背上，念冰的臉色顯得很蒼白，接連噴出幾口鮮血，身體周圍的光芒早已變得暗淡了，就連那七個影傀儡也已經收入了自己的體內，他在大口大口的喘息著。\n\n神人們是驚異的，念冰又何嘗不是？他用誅神箭迷惑眾神的六感後，立刻施展了一個卡奧傳授給他的魔法，這個憑藉精神力、冰系魔法、空間系魔法三種能量融合的空間魔法雖然成功的反射了對方的能量，但是，卻並沒有能將所有能量完全過濾掉，八大神人的合擊實在太強了，魔鏡破碎，穿透鏡子的能量被七名影傀儡聯合擋下了大部分，但念冰還是因為能量的衝擊和自身精神力、魔法力的大量消耗而受了不輕的傷。如果不是他精神力極為強悍，恐怕此時早已虛弱得昏迷了。在危機關頭，奧斯卡自行出現，幫念冰化解了剩餘的衝擊力，但精神力和魔法力的震盪還是讓念冰的實力瞬間大減。此時，在衝擊力的作用下，他已經回到了冰谷上方。\n\n神人們都看到了念冰吐血，此時，他們並沒有再合力發動攻擊。九名神人同時向念冰閃電般追了過來。這麼好的機會，他們又怎麼會放過呢？在他們眼中，只要能將眼前這個小子殺死，就再沒有人能阻止他們完成任務了。\n\n奧斯卡的龍神心訣已經修煉到了第四層，接近第五層的境界，在龍族中，能夠如此快領悟龍神心訣的奧秘，絕對是天才中的天才，這當然與念冰的龐大精神力以及生命、死亡兩種最純淨的能量有關，但他自身的特殊情況也起到了極為重要的作用。可惜的是，對手太強大了，奧斯卡就算綜合所有實力，現在也只能勉強算是一個十二階的高手，與如此眾多的強者相比，它的實力是遠遠不夠的。\n\n灰色的鱗甲覆蓋在念冰和奧斯卡的身上，奧斯卡沒有逃跑，神人們以鬥氣飛行雖然消耗能量極快，但是，飛行的速度卻絕不遜色於他，此時逃跑，是根本不可能的。所以，他們只有面對。\n\n神人們先後經過幾次挫折，此時已經變得極為精明了，最前面的三名神人，在剛一接近冰谷之時，手中頓時出現了屬於他們自己的武器，那是三柄長劍，三道劍光如閃電般劈空而出，劍光在空中分散，化為無數劍氣斬向了先前射出誅神箭的三面冰壁，而其他神人們，則毫無停頓地向念冰撲來。\n\n念冰心中暗嘆，他明白，強者畢竟是強者，雖然誅神箭很強，如果對方只有兩三人，在適合的環境下，很有可能被誅神箭射殺，但是，對方的強者實在太多了，他一看那劍氣發出的力道，就知道自己的屬下們已經幫不上忙了。手腕一振，一個捲軸被他捏碎，金色的光芒沖天而起。\n\n冰壁在神人們剛一出現的時候，就又一次噴射出了一百支雙系誅神箭，而這時，三名神人的攻擊與念冰發出的金光先後出現。\n\n空中亮起一團團紅、藍色的光芒，但是，在劍氣的干擾下，幾乎所有誅神箭都沒有能夠完成冰火同源的威力，單體九階攻擊魔法雖然不弱，但在距離不夠，又沒能以冰火同源提升自己能量的前提下，已經對神人們無法構成威脅。而包括聖師在內的其餘七名神人已經來到念冰面前，聖師的臉色很難看，他沒有向念冰發動攻擊，而是身體一沉，向下方落去，找那些倒霉的亡靈大軍洩去了。而剩餘的六名神人則分別從不同的方向攻向念冰。\n\n就在這時，兩個變化同時出現，一個，就是來自此時最關鍵的人物幽幽，她已經開始了下一句的咒語吟唱，而她身體周圍的光芒也開始發生了變化。\n\n「榮耀——的——龍——炎——王——，六——芒——之——陣——的——掌——管——者——，請——實現——我的——願望——」黑色的氣流似乎變得實質化了，此時，她雙爪之間那血紅色的光球已經變得有雞蛋大小，不穩定的紅光不斷閃爍著，幽幽的雙眼流露出懾人的光彩，在充滿陰邪的氣息中，那暗紅色的眸光竟然散出淡淡的聖潔氣息。一個暗紅色的六芒星從她腳下緩緩浮現，彷彿在襯托著她的身體一般，在她腳下閃爍著淡淡的光彩。而她額頭上那血紅色的符號此時已經噴灑出淡淡的紅色光芒，在額頭前凝結成一個紅色的三角形，與腳下的血紅色六芒星遙遙相對。隨著她這句咒語的吟唱，那抑揚頓挫的聲音每多吟唱一個字，腳下的光芒就會變得凝實一些。\n\n幽幽的變化使神人們的心情變得急切了，雖然他們都知道揭開默奧達斯封印之瓶的過程只是剛剛開始不久，但這個進程每延續一分，對他們來說，就多一分恥辱。作為高傲的神人，他們都憤怒了。\n\n就在幽幽這句咒語開始吟唱的同時，神人們手中的神兵散發出強烈的鬥氣即將向念冰發動毀滅攻擊的同時，另一個變化也出現了。每一個神人頭頂上方突然都毫無預兆的出現了一個銀色的六芒星。沒有任何聲息，那銀色的光芒看上去也十分黯淡，而且氣息隱藏的極為巧妙，並沒有引起神人們的注意。當他們感覺到不對時，六個巨大的身影已經從天而落。\n\n那是六個完全不同的巨大身影，帶來的，卻是異常恐怖的氣息，每一個覆蓋的面積都有數十丈，如同六座小山一般落了下來。\n\n清晰的看到這一幕，本來正準備以空間魔法閃躲攻擊的念冰差點笑出來，這突然出現的六個黑影他都熟悉的很，其中一對大小相似，外貌完全一樣的暗魔鼠正是甜甜和甜甜的媽，母子倆茫然的對視著，不知道發生了什麼，黑色的巨大身體憑空落下，兩鼠索性閉上眼睛，四隻小眼睛閉著，四肢收到身前，來了一個屁股向下平沙落地式，直接坐了下去。\n\n而另外四個黑影的個頭也絲毫不比這對母子小，其中，最有代表性的，就是那兩隻超級豬了，一個是念冰在天香那座綠山上收來的飛天神豬，還有一個就是菊花豬官官，它們的屁股比起暗魔鼠還要大上幾分，尤其是官官屁股後面菊花狀的尾巴，還不斷的搖擺著。",

    "content": "另外兩個體積也不小，一個是爆奶金牛淡淡，另一個是巨大無比的蟑螂。蟑螂的體積顯然是最小的，不過，它在剛一出現的瞬間，就變成了官官的樣子，它特殊能力有一項是模仿，能夠模仿任何魔獸，並且具有其一半的能力，就連體重也模仿了一半。\n\n正準備攻擊念冰的神人們突然感覺到上方傳來的巨大危機，頓時更改了自己的目標，畢竟，自己的生命都是最重要的，比起生命來，殺念冰完全可以放在次要。眼看著六座小山般的巨大身體同時下壓，他們毫不猶豫的收起了自已的兵器，六名神人做出了同樣的動作－－雙手托天式。不過，他們還是小看了官官它們的重量，從空中而落，這些巨型魔獸巨大的身體帶來的衝擊力是神人們無法相象的，六聲慘叫幾乎同時響起，在那六座大山的巨壓下驟然隕落，朝地面墜去。\n\n這傑作自然來自貓貓，貓貓曾經聽念冰講過降伏飛天神豬的過程，對於暗影傀儡用甜甜它媽砸飛天神豬那一幕記憶猶深，在念冰出現危險的同時，她頓時想到了這一招，更何況，她的這些魔獸身體都極為強悍，從空中落下，使者只能是地面。\n\n此時，破壞了誅神箭攻擊的三名神人異常囂張，縱橫的劍氣接連破壞了血獅教高手們動的兩撥誅神箭，劍氣凝結，同時向三面冰壁劈去。在他們動第二撥劍氣的時候，念冰放出的金光在空中已經幻化為一朵巨大的金色菊花。\n\n冰壁在轟然巨響中被削薄近丈，但是，那些襲擊神人們的血獅教精銳們卻已經帶著誅神弩消失了。早在開始準備應付神人們的時候，念冰就做好了充足的預判，當時貓貓失蹤是念冰讓她去執行一個任務。在兩隻暗魔鼠作用下，所有神人所在的冰洞內部，都被挖出了一條通道，在冰山內部的一個空洞中匯合，只要念冰信號一出，這些血獅教地精銳們就會坐滑梯一般從冰洞內部的通道滑走。在內部匯合後撤退。這是保全他們的最好辦法。\n\n而此時，那六名突然被召喚獸們下壓的神人也終於利用自己強的實力在鬥氣減緩官官等召喚獸下壓的同時逃了出去，不過，當他們的身體落到地面時，卻都現自己已經被包圍了，並不是被亡靈軍團包圍，而是被那六隻在地面出大坑的魔獸包圍。\n\n六隻如同山嶽般地魔獸神色不善的看著他們，其中。他們認識的只有那隻飛天神豬，守護綠山的魔獸怎麼會來到了這裡？緊接著，另六名神人大跌眼鏡地是，隨著銀色光影的閃爍。空中又落下三大團黑影，而周圍那六個黑影竟然沒有用任何攻擊手段，直接向他們撞來。憑藉著巨大的身體，將他們所有可以逃脫的路線封死。\n\n從空中落下的，是黑武皇在綠山上收服的九瓜毒蛛、碧目蒼虬和黑虎王，現在，他們已經是貓貓的召喚獸了，如果論體積來說，誰也無法和那巨大的碧目蒼虬相比，單是它自己的身體，就覆蓋了整個上空。一想到碧目蒼虬可怕的防禦力，六名神人絕不會選擇從上方突圍。何況，上面落下的還有它們熟悉的巨毒九瓜蜘蛛和以狂暴聞名的黑虎王。在瞬間地抉擇上，他們選擇了看似肥胖又粉嫩的菊花豬官官，至少從表面看起來，它是最不兇悍的一個。現在，只有找到缺口衝出去，才能避免被壓死的命運。\n\n空中的念冰都楞了一下，他也沒想到貓貓對這些召喚獸的控制居然如此精妙，一瞬間就讓他壓力大減，憑藉召喚獸困住了六名神人還占據了絕對的上風。不過，他此時也沒心情管貓貓了，因為那空中失去目標的三名神人已經朝他沖了過來。\n\n六名神人已經來不及取出兵器了，而且他們也沒想要用兵器，兵器就算能殺死面前這頭豬，也不能阻止它衝來的身體，在生命受到威脅的時候，神人們地配合變得異常默契。同時揮出了他們的拳頭向官官轟去，只要能讓這頭豬減緩衝擊，他們就能找到一絲縫隙衝出去，一旦離開這尷尬的境地，恢復一下先前接連幾次全力攻擊消耗的鬥氣，這些魔獸雖強，但也不是無法毀滅的。\n\n如果現在這六名神人的實力保持在顛峰狀態，官官就算再進化一階，恐怕也要被他們震退，可惜，這六名神人在接連長時間飛行以及全力攻擊和誅神箭下所受的損傷影響下，再加上被這突然出現地九隻巨大魔獸驚嚇中，實力最多也只能揮出五成。\n\n神人們都看到了不可思議的一幕，一隻漂亮的火紅色狐狸出現在菊花豬官官頭頂，那金色的長毛在這冰天雪地之中看起來分外醒目，漂亮的大尾巴向後甩起，露出它那漂亮的狐狸頭，探頭探腦的看著六名神人。一瞬間，六名神人都從這隻金紅色的狐狸眼中看到了一絲戲謔的笑容。狐狸也會笑？神人們心中出現了一絲疑問。緊接著，他們現，這隻狐狸的笑容竟然是那麼猥褻，就像正在準備扒光美女衣服時流氓的眼神，左腿一抬，一股金黃色的尿液從下體噴射而出，頓時淋了菊花豬官官一頭一臉。濃郁的騷氣沖天而起，另其他幾隻魔獸的度頓時減緩了一些，正抬起身體噴射著金色牛奶的爆奶金牛淡淡，一雙牛眼看著官官，流露出幸災樂禍的光芒。\n\n在那金黃色的尿液滑落之時，菊花豬官官變了，它那如同小山一般的肥胖身體瞬間停滯，緊接著，一場不像是豬叫的尖叫聲傳遍整片冰谷，就算是象殺豬時豬出的慘叫，也絕沒有官官此時叫的那麼悽厲。粉紅色的官官身上的顏色瞬間變成了紫黑，一股充滿霸道的紫黑色氣流混合著腥臊的尿氣散而出，豬嘴裡居然長出兩隻黑色的獠牙，一雙豬眼已經變成了血紅的顏色，巨大的鼻孔噴吐著灼熱地氣息，每一次吸氣，或許是因為那腥臊之氣的緣故，都會使它身體周圍的紫黑色氣流霸氣更加充沛。四隻有力的豬蹄同時跺地，巨大的豬體騰空而起。那雙肥碩的耳朵向兩旁張開，體現出平衡的作用，龐大的紫黑色氣流凝結成一股，巨大的豬嘴中咆哮出不像豬的聲音，「騷狐狸，我日，獸血沸騰。」\n\n這一切生的極快，幾乎在六名神人衝出的同時，狐狸那那地尿液就已經噴灑而出了，而當六名神人瞬間加的同時，變成紫黑色的官官也已經沖了起來。六名神人突然都產生出一種強烈地不安，面前的這隻變了顏色的豬。產生的氣息竟然能散出如此霸道的王者騷氣，恐怕……\n\n貓貓此時正裹著大衣藏在一個角落中，她身上有念冰施加的護身封印。使寒冰不至侵襲，此時正瞪大了眼睛看著官官，喃喃的自言自語道：「天啊！那那居然又進化了，它這尿液噬血術居然讓官官達到了進化第七階的頂端。」\n\n轟－－－，官官沒有任何閃躲，直接撞上了六名神人攻擊而來的鬥氣，它那龐大身體所散的紫黑色氣流，居然如同旋渦一般卸去了部分鬥氣衝擊，龐大的身體與六名神人正面撞擊在一起，轟地一聲巨響。神人畢竟是神人，即使只揮出了五成攻擊力，但還是將官官震的飛了出去，但是，他們也被那狂猛無濤的反震之力震的全身麻，只能眼睜睜的看著天上和地下的魔獸將自己合圍了。\n\n眼看碧目蒼虬當頭落下，六名神人在死亡的恐慌下做出了令念冰心跳漏掉半拍的舉動，六股澎湃的能量同時向上衝擊而起是，竟然在沒有回力的情況下將碧目蒼虬掀飛，而他們身體周圍地氣息瞬間強大兩倍。接連向周圍揮出重拳，將衝擊而來的魔獸們一一擊退。\n\n爆穴。居然爆掉了自己的竅穴？念冰心中產生出不可思議的感覺，六名神人同時爆竅穴，這不是有病麼？他們中只要有兩人爆竅穴就足以應對眼前的危機了，但真正的情況卻是六個人爆。不過，轉瞬間他明白過來，以這些神人的自私。誰又願意消耗自己地實力來救別人呢？當最後毫無辦法的時候，他們選擇的都是自救，自然也就出現了眼前的一幕。\n\n一名神人爆竅穴都是可怕的，更何況是全部六名神人了，九隻強大的魔獸威懾力頓時變得小了許多，但是，就在這時，那隻猥褻的狐狸又出現了，它並不是出現在官官頭上，這一次，它從暗魔鼠甜甜背上探出了身體。\n\n念冰這邊也並沒有閒著，他離開了奧斯卡的身體，自己漂浮在半空之中，天眼領域因為精神力受到的震盪暫時無法使用了，但是他還可以瞬魔法，此時，一道黑色的身影代替了念冰原來的位置，滅神斧已經變成了巨大的長柄戰斧，先前偷襲殺死一名神人的舄鹵，神威凜凜的站奧斯卡背上，獨自一人迎上了三名神人的攻擊，有著奧斯卡和念冰的輔助，這三名神人雖然都是十三階的高手，但還是被殺的只能防禦，卻毫無還手之力。\n\n下方的六名神人看到狐狸那那又出現了，因為竅穴爆帶來的悲壯信心瞬間消失了一點，剛才，就是這隻有著猥褻眼神的狐狸撒了泡尿，才使那粉紅色的豬猛的阻止了自己等人衝出去的最後希望，它怎麼又出來了？\n\n狐狸那那的眼神依舊是那麼猥褻，它沒有去看六名神人，骨碌骨碌亂轉的小眼睛去落在了自己同伴們的身上，不論是念冰給貓貓的魔獸，還是貓貓本身的召喚獸，看到這猥褻的眼神，全身都不禁激靈了一下，不好的預感油然而生。\n\n狐狸的動作很敏捷，當它那猥褻的眼神從周圍的同伴們身上掃過後，口中頓時出吱吱的叫聲，身體一轉，狐狸頭藏在兩隻前瓜內側，大尾巴揚起，遮在自己前身上，把屁股高高的撅了起來，露出那根金色的長刺。\n\n剛想動手的六名神人同時停滯了一下，狐狸屁股上會長刺？這到是天下奇聞了，一名惡毒的神人甚至想到，難道這狐狸被人用尖刺插到了屁股里？\n\n但是，很快神人們就又一次領教了狐狸的恐怖，那根尖刺上金光大盛，緊接著，噗嗤一聲輕響，一股黃色的氣體從其中噴涌而出，即使是如此寒冰的環境，也無法影響那黃色氣體威，氣體擴張的度極快，只是一瞬間，就蔓延到所有魔獸和召喚獸們所在的包圍方位，當然，那六名可憐的神人也沒能避免被這黃色的氣體所覆蓋。狐狸吱吱的叫著，它那聲音說不出的猥褻，黃色的氣體瞬間釋放之後，它那大尾巴一擺，已經不知道跑到哪裡去了。\n\n臭，一股惡臭瞬間瀰漫於黃色氣體所籠罩的全部範圍，那絕不是一般的臭。臭到連殭屍和亡靈冤魂們都四散飛逃，那股臭氣，仿佛吃了無數臭雞蛋後釋放的毒氣。此時，神人們才明白狐狸做了什麼，它居然在放屁，而且是如此之臭的級屁。\n\n神人們想起了一句古話，逆風臭死三十里。這裡風雖然不小，但那黃色的氣體卻像凝固了似的籠罩在原本的範圍內，絲毫沒有消散的跡象。\n\n貓貓在角落中出銀鈴般的笑聲，全輔助系的狐狸又怎麼是好對付的呢？作為眾獸中的狐頭軍師，它對魔獸和召喚獸的攻擊控制比自己還要靈活，而它眼前噴的，就是進化後剛剛擁有的級輔助技能，狐屁領域。那不僅僅是一個屁那麼簡單，而是一個以臭氣形成的領域，雖然並不雅觀，但是，那卻絕對是魔獸界最強的輔助領域之一。",

    "title": "Chapter 222 Nian Bing's True Backstage (Part 1)",
    "content": "In the yellow gas, apart from the fleeing fox, the bodies of the nine summoned beasts all solidified for a moment. Following that, the first to change was Guan Guan, who had just been blasted away and chased back. The pitiful Chrysanthemum Pig, which had just turned from purple back to pink, exhibited another anomaly under the stench. However, this time the storm was even more violent. Guan Guan's already huge body instantly grew a few sizes, becoming even more plump. Following that, under the effect of the stench, Guan Guan's pig eyes turned a deeper black. It let out a furious roar, its giant ears flapping as it flew up. A circle of black airflow rose around its body. Its massive body, suspended in mid-air, unleashed another \"Beast Blood Boiling.\" And this time, it was even more terrifying.\n\nMao Mao exclaimed in surprise, \"Wow, no way, ultimate Beast Blood Boiling? This fart is really strong, it actually instantly increased the strength of all magical beasts within the domain range by two stages.\"\n\nAll the magical beasts showed the same changes. Except for the Azure-Eyed Azure Dragon, their eyes all turned black, and their bodies swelled without exception. As Guan Guan attacked, they all used their strongest attack skills, charging towards the six awakened divine beings. At this moment, the divine beings hated the fox with the lewd gaze. However, they no longer had the energy to search for the fox. At this time, the fox, Na Na, was taking big breaths in a corner. Although that fart felt great, its consumption of its own energy was also immense. At this moment, its golden-red fur had become much duller. It was watching the magical beasts enter a berserk state with its small, lewd eyes. The power of his \"Fox Fart Domain\" was immense. As long as it was covered, the coverage area would move with the movement of the magical beasts. Within this domain, all beasts would enter a state of ultimate berserk, which is what Mao Mao called an increase of two stages. Although the duration was not long, magical beasts that suddenly increased by two stages were extremely terrifying. At the same time, humans within this domain would be affected by the stench, and their strength would decrease by about twenty percent. This \"Fox Fart Domain\" was also one of the fox Na Na's strongest support skills. Although the duration of the domain was limited, the time for the divine beings to awaken their acupoints was also limited.\n\nNian Bing, suspended in the air, continuously released magic to assist Xi Lu and Oscar while watching Na Na's actions. Na Na's powerful support domain also startled him. At this moment, he finally understood that among Mao Mao's many summoned beasts, the true king was this seemingly lewd fox. The frenzy of the summoned beasts was so great that even the six awakened divine beings could not break free. They could only defend themselves in a stalemate. Nian Bing understood that if this continued, Mao Mao might personally avenge her parents and tribesmen. Even if he himself wanted to challenge Mao Mao alone with so many pets, victory would only be possible through despicable means.\n\nTime was ticking away. As You You completed her fourth incantation, the red six-pointed star beneath her feet emitted an unusually strong red light. Finally, she began to chant her fifth incantation. Although the divine beings in the field were anxious, they were helpless in the current situation. Nian Bing, Xi Lu, Oscar, and Mao Mao's pets were engaging the nine divine beings. Although the Holy Master was charging into the undead army like a tiger entering a flock of sheep, it was very difficult to charge through in a short period of time. Moreover, beside You You, there was Xie Yue, whose strength was even greater than the Holy Master.\n\nXie Yue was also very surprised at this moment. He had not expected Nian Bing and the others to be so powerful. Those magical and domineering magic arrows, coupled with their own strength, made Xie Yue realize that neither side in the current battle could be dealt with by his subordinates. Now, he was actually feeling a little schadenfreude. With Nian Bing as free labor, his chances of success were even greater.\n\n\"I – am – the – messenger – who – controls – the – scarlet – flames – of – the – mortal – world – and – hereby – request – the – fulfillment – of – the – ancient – forbidden – covenant –\"\n\nYou You's chanting suddenly became louder, and the chanting became faster. Her tone was no longer so unpredictable. Every word rose with the rising intensity. She opened her arms. A red light sphere, now the size of a palm, floated before her chest. The golden light emitted from the seven Myodars Seal Bottles had already been dyed red and black. The light shooting into the sky was becoming more and more solid.\n\nThe seven bottles vibrated continuously, emitting buzzing sounds. Golden symbols flowed on the bottles, and the incantation had entered another stage. At this moment, You You's pretty face exuded an even more sacred aura.\n\nJust then, a resonant dragon roar echoed from afar. The dragon roar was distant and loud. Following that, six consecutive dragon roars responded. The seven dragon roars intertwined in the air, forming a beautiful melody. Seven-colored light accompanied by the dragon roars appeared from afar. Seven colossal figures approached the ice valley at a speed imperceptible to the naked eye. The majestic dragon king aura made the atmosphere within the ice valley even more solemn.\n\nThe Dark Dragon King Kajiotes, whose entire body was black with faint golden light, led the other six Dragon Kings and finally arrived. The situation, which was originally favorable to Nian Bing and Xie Yue, once again became unpredictable. Xie Yue's expression changed slightly. He knew that all he could rely on now was himself and his subordinates. He was very clear about the strength of the Seven Dragon Kings, because they had already forged a deadly feud from the previous incident. Could he hold out for enough time? A trace of coldness appeared on Xie Yue's face, and he raised his right hand. The Zombie King, Vampire, and Necromancers who had always guarded him moved in an orderly fashion.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings finally arrived. Nian Bing's spirits also lifted. Similar to the situation in front, his magic power and mental power had been significantly weakened. Even with the assistance of Xi Lu and Oscar, he could only fight to a draw with the three peak 13th-tier experts in front of him. He was naturally aware of the strength of the Seven Dragon Kings. Kajiotes had certainly reached the 13th tier, and the other six Dragon Kings were also at the 12th tier. Coupled with the Dragon race's naturally powerful bodies, their selfless cooperation, and mysterious Dragon language magic, their overall strength would not be inferior to the ten divine beings in front of them. If the Dragon Kings were determined to destroy the seal, then the only ones who could stop them now were Xie Yue and his undead army in front.\n\nThe dragons' flying speed was naturally extremely terrifying. In a short while, they arrived in the ice valley. The strong pressure brought by the seven giant dragons immediately invigorated the divine beings, causing them to counterattack madly. They even urged the Dragon Kings to quickly deal with You You in front.\n\nNian Bing's left hand held ice, and his right hand held flames. Under the effect of the Sigh of the Ice Goddess and the Roar of the Fire God, the two 11th-tier forbidden spells continuously assisted Xi Lu in his attack. Their goal was to delay, so Xi Lu had not used his strongest attacks until now.\n\nSeeing the arrival of the Seven Dragon Kings, Nian Bing said calmly, \"Do you really have to do that?\"\n\nKajiotes, with a slight frown, looked at Nian Bing and said, \"And you? Have you truly made your choice?\"\n\nNian Bing replied without hesitation, \"Yes, I have made my choice, and I firmly believe that my choice is correct. You also have your own mission. If you want to make a move, then make it. Now, we are fighting for our respective...\" He paused, then continued, \"ideals.\"\n\nThe seven rays of light suddenly converged, and the Seven Dragon Kings in the air transformed into human form. A rare smile appeared on Kajiotes's face. \"Good. Since you have made your choice, then let us fight for our respective ideals.\" Saying that, he waved his right hand. Immediately, without even looking at the three divine beings that Nian Bing, Oscar, and Xi Lu were fighting, the Seven Dragon Kings charged down with their companions.\n\nOne Holy Master might not be enough to collapse the undead army, but with the addition of the Light Dragon King Dimantti, who was also of the light element, and the other six Dragon Kings, the undead army instantly became as fragile as paper. As soon as the Seven Dragon Kings entered the ice valley, they reverted to their original forms, and then they began a sweeping annihilation.\n\nZombies are poisonous, and their attack and defense are not bad, but the Dragon Kings directly ignored them. They didn't even look at the zombies' attacks, turning them into fragments with a casual wave of their hands. As for the potent poison on the zombies, could their abilities break through the Dragon Kings' defensive dragon aura and thick dragon scales? Obviously, the answer was uncertain. Amidst this surging tide of attacks, the undead army on the outer perimeter rapidly decreased like melting snow and ice. The Seven Dragon Kings' targets were You You and Xie Yue in the center. As for Nian Bing and the others in the air, and the magical beasts on the ground, they didn't even look at them.\n\nIn an instant, Xie Yue's side was in dire straits. The ordinary undead army couldn't even delay the Seven Dragon Kings' progress. Just then, as You You's chanting quickened, her fifth incantation finally ended. In an instant, from the light emitted by the seven Myodars Seal Bottles, all the blackness disappeared, replaced by incredibly surging red flames. Yes, it was flames, flames without temperature, flames full of evil. You You's hands returned to the front, transforming into a strange hand shape, and the blood-red light sphere floated quietly above her hands, as if this red light sphere was the source of all the red flames. The sinister energy erupting from the ice cave beneath her feet was continuously absorbed by You You. With every bit absorbed, the red light around her body grew stronger. With the increasingly strong red light, You You's pale pretty face became more prominent. Her slender hands clearly revealed the veins through which blood flowed. Her black eyes had no depth; there was only endless emptiness.\n\nShe opened her delicate lips again and chanted word by word, \"With – blood – and – magic – as – the – lock – and – key – open – the – gate – of – time – and – space –\" The chanting speed slowed down again. With each word uttered, You You's body trembled, and the seven Myodars Seal Bottles also trembled. She seemed to be exerting great effort now, her body swaying precariously in the blood-red flames, appearing as if she could be annihilated at any moment.\n\nXie Yue could see You You's changes, and the Seven Dragon Kings could naturally see them too. The seven Dragon Kings simultaneously let out resonant dragon roars. The seven Dragon Kings simultaneously spat out essence-like dragon breath, instantly clearing an open space. The Fire Dragon King Galamantis and the Ice Dragon King Sasarice simultaneously flew up, heading straight for You You in the air with the aura of ice and fire.\n\nFrom the first shot of the God-Slaying Arrow to the Seven Dragon Kings finally approaching You You, only a quarter of an hour had passed in real time. Within this quarter of an hour, much had happened. And now, it was time for the final critical moment.\n\nXie Yue's body floated up. His eyes had completely turned blood-red. The sinister necromancers chanted in a language incomprehensible to humans. Large amounts of sinister energy permeated the surroundings. Black airflow enveloped them, instantly obscuring You You from the Dragon Kings' sight. Large swathes of black mist emerged out of nowhere, making \"puff\" sounds upon contact with the dragon aura.\n\nThe Zombie King and the Vampires also pounced out, meeting the two rising Dragon Kings. They displayed combat power completely different from ordinary zombies and vampires. Especially the green flying Zombie King, whose body, nearly ten feet tall, directly clashed with the attacks of the two Dragon Kings from below. The Vampire Kings, on the other hand, continuously emanated waves of bloody aura, entangling the two Dragon Kings from the surroundings with lightning speed. With the combined efforts of dozens of Zombie Kings, Vampire Kings, and Necromancers, Galamantis and Sasarice were temporarily forced into a disadvantage, unable to advance further.\n\nA ghastly green skull appeared before Xie Yue. He muttered incantations, and the black mist was dyed black-green by layers of green light emitted from his body. Wrapped in this black-green light, the speed of the vampires and zombies became even faster. The Vampire Kings could even achieve short-distance instantaneous movement. Sasarice and Galamantis, due to their massive bodies, were hit several times, causing them to roar. They continuously spat out large mouthfuls of dragon breath, forcing back the surrounding enemies.\n\nXie Yue's location was directly in front of You You's body. He coldly watched everything that was happening before him, without any sign of panic. His goal, like Nian Bing's, was to delay.",

    "content": "The undead army on the ground had no more fight left, having been swept clean by the remaining five Dragon Kings. Just as the five Dragon Kings were about to take to the sky, a gray airflow suddenly appeared like clouds. Immediately, the bodies of the five Dragon Kings stiffened, and their bodies, which were about to fly up, suddenly fell. To their surprise, they found they had lost the ability to fly.\n\nDimanteiti frowned and said, \"A prohibition curse. It's that Nether-Shaman.\" She began to utter strange intonations, while the other four Dragon Kings, led by Kaji'osi, instantly surrounded Dimanteiti. The dragon language magic of the dragon race finally appeared.\n\nIndeed, the prohibition curse was formally cast by Safen. However, all he could do was temporarily incapacute the flight abilities of a few Dragon Kings. The five Dragon Kings did not rush to attack, but the Grandmaster was now free. Under the effect of battle qi, he soared into the sky, helping Garamantis and Sasariss share some of the pressure. With his holy battle qi, the attack power of the Vampire King and the Zombie King immediately decreased significantly.\n\nJust then, the sky began to change. Without anyone noticing, Youyou's sixth incantation was completed. Blood-red flames shot straight into the sky through the passage formed by Meaudas's Sealing Bottle. The golden symbols on Meaudas's Sealing Bottle emitted strong golden light, and one symbol after another floated out, leaving the bottle and merging into the red light pillar in the sky. The sky seemed to be dyed completely blood-red by the blood-red flames. Even the area where the cloud layer had been formed by the full force attack of the eight divine beings earlier turned blood-red. A giant blood-red gate, of indeterminate size, appeared in the sky. This gate was very simple, without any decorative patterns, with golden patterns around it, and the gate body was completely red. Although it looked like merely a void illusion, pressure suddenly descended. Under the shroud of the red sky, everything around was filled with an ominous aura. The killing intent of the Seven Dragon Kings and the divine beings had also risen. They all knew that they could not let Youyou's incantation continue any longer, otherwise, the seal of Meaudas's Sealing Bottle might truly be opened.\n\nXie Yue looked at the anomaly in the sky and rejoiced. He knew that the moment he had been expecting was about to arrive. The ancient incantation he obtained from the ground was completely correct, and his painstaking efforts were not in vain. Although Youyou's body was shrouded in black and green mist, her voice still came through clearly. At this moment, Xie Yue suddenly felt a little sorry for his daughter. After all, there were still over ten years of affection between them. Even though he was a being of darkness, the familial bond between father and daughter still existed. Youyou's words, \"I will return my life to him,\" lingered in his mind. Xie Yue suddenly had an urge to stop all of this from continuing. However, he was, after all, the Lord of Evil, the master of evil. He suppressed the urge, and his auxiliary dark magic became even more powerful.\n\nThe four Dragon Kings guarding Dimanteiti simultaneously spewed a powerful dragon's breath, charging directly at Xie Yue. They all knew that only by dealing with Xie Yue could they stop Youyou's incantation. Xie Yue sneered, his body flashed slightly, and he retreated into the mist behind him. The breath, led by Kaji'osi, fell into empty space, causing only a slight ripple in the black and green mist. After their attack, Xie Yue reappeared, with blood-red beads surrounding his body.\n\nKaji'osi frowned. \"Dark Magic Artifact: Crimson Devour.\"\n\nXie Yue glanced at Kaji'osi, as if to say, \"You know about the existence of dark magic artifacts too?\"\n\nThe blood-red demonic beads spun rapidly, and circles of blood-red magic artifacts floated out, merging into the black and green mist. Immediately, all the Zombie Kings, Vampire Kings, and necromancers exploded as if they had been injected with stimulants. Garamantis, Sasariss, and the Grandmaster were instantly subjected to a ferocious barrage of attacks, making them unable to bear it any longer. With a muffled thud, they rapidly retreated, evading the sharpness of the undead's attack.\n\nThe true powerhouses among the undead army did not pursue. Protected by the mist, they floated in front of Xie Yue, looking at the Seven Dragon Kings with their lifeless, cold eyes.\n\n\"Purify the flame of sin! Hear my call!\" Youyou's seventh incantation was completed at this moment. A golden flame rose from the mist and shot into the blood-red gate in the sky through the light pillar formed by Meaudas's Sealing Bottle. The gate trembled slightly and opened a crack. Golden light seeped from the crack, and the air seemed to freeze for a moment before returning to normal. A triangular golden symbol appeared above the gate.\n\nDimanteiti's dragon language magic was finally completed. A golden halo appeared above her head. The halo had a diameter of one zhang and floated out. A sacred aura immediately drove away the surrounding evil and charged directly at Xie Yue. However, even the Dragon Kings themselves knew that Xie Yue, who possessed the dark magic artifact Crimson Devour, could not be killed by this dragon language spell of dispelling evil. Therefore, at the same time the golden halo appeared, the Seven Dragon Kings also rushed forward.\n\nAt this moment, a pleasant voice with a cold aura echoed in the air. It was a chanting voice, so fluid and moving, and incredibly fast. It began to chant just as Dimanteiti's dragon language dispelling spell was cast. When the dispelling spell had crossed half the spatial distance and was still some distance away from Xie Yue, the incantation had already been firmly established.\n\n\"Nine Currents' ... Floating Cloud Land... Heaven and Earth Weep... Mountain Skeletons Close... Blue King! Hear the ancient pact!\n\nTo the other shore of time! Let the four cardinal ice elements\n\nHear my request! Witness my devout tears... carrying faint sorrow, traces of longing, and deep fear... Destruction.\"\n\nThe ice and snow in the air condensed almost instantly. A vast icy aura surged forth at this moment. It seemed to be one voice, or perhaps countless voices chanting, as if all the ice elements in the air were instantly gathered. A giant blue ice lotus appeared out of thin air in front of Xie Yue. Dimanteiti's dragon language spell became so insignificant in front of the ice lotus that it was almost instantly swallowed by this ten-zhang diameter ice-blue lotus.\n\nThe pure and beautiful ice lotus, carrying a cold aura and extreme cold energy, seemed to want to freeze everything around it. Even though it was not directed at Xie Yue, Lord Xie Yue, who was closest to the ice lotus, felt an overwhelming, almost irresistible wave of cold. What kind of magic was this? Xie Yue was somewhat stunned. To cast such a high-level ice magic in such an extremely cold place, its power could only be described as terrifying. Even Dimanteiti's dispelling spell, which reached level twelve, seemed like a joke in front of it.\n\nHundreds of figures appeared at the other end of the ice valley. They floated quietly above the ice valley, as if they themselves were ice sculptures. A faint glow emanated from them, exuding waves of cold air. They belonged here, to the cold of this place.\n\nFor one person, clad in a pure white sacrificial robe, a blue ice lotus was embroidered on her chest, exactly the same ice lotus as the one in front of Xie Yue.\n\nA calm and peaceful voice emerged from her mouth, \"Esteemed Dragon Kings, I do not wish to be your enemy, but please do not obstruct the ongoing ritual. For the sake of the humans of the Radiant Continent, I must offend you.\" Her expression was so serene. Although she did not speak to the Seven Dragon Kings, her benevolent gaze had already drifted to Bing Luan, who was fighting the divine beings.\n\nKaji'osi frowned. \"Ice Snow Goddess Priest.\"\n\nThe woman smiled and shook her head, saying, \"I am, but I am not the Ice Snow Goddess Priest you know.\"\n\nThe one who arrived was Nian Bing's mother, Bing Ling, the new generation Ice Snow Goddess Priest, and the most outstanding mages of the Ice God Pagoda. Their individual strength might not be the strongest, but the magic that a hundred ice mages could unleash in this extremely cold environment was definitely extremely terrifying. Here, the magic enhancement they could receive was incomparable to anywhere else on the Radiant Continent. The 'Soul of the Blue Sprite', unleashed by a hundred mages working together, which was that ice lotus, had reached level fourteen.\n\nNian Bing naturally saw his mother's appearance. It was only then that he realized his mother was such a powerful mage. While the magic cast by a hundred ice mages with environmental amplification was indeed terrifying, without Bing Ling, who had reached level thirteen, leading them, they could not have completed a level fourteen supreme magic. One must know that level fourteen meant strength comparable to the main gods of the Divine Continent!\n\n\"Mom—\" Nian Bing's shout resolved the confusion in the Dragon Kings' minds. Just then, two figures, one blue and one red, appeared out of thin air. The red figure embodied extreme heat, while the blue figure emitted a shimmering blue light like a cicada's wing amidst a phoenix cry. With just a flash and a flicker, combined with the attacks of Xiluo, Oscar, and Nian Bing, the three desperately resisting divine beings had no chance to explode their acupoints and turned into dust of history.\n\nA sneak attack, yes, it was a sneak attack. The two who ambushed Nian Bing were both so familiar. They each possessed crystal-clear red and blue wings. After their full-force attack exploded, Nian Bing saw the resentful look on their faces.\n\n\"Why did you abandon us? Can't we help you?\"\n\nChenchen, Feng Nü, you've come too.\" Appearing before Nian Bing were Lan Chen and Feng Nü, who had made a qualitative leap to level thirteen after obtaining the Phoenix Volcano.\n\nFeng Nü said angrily, \"Not only did we come, Ling'er also came. She's with Mom. Just you wait, after this is over, we'll see how we punish you for daring to abandon us, hmph hmph.\"\n\nNian Bing said with a wry smile, \"How could I abandon you? I was afraid you would be in danger!\"\n\nLan Chen stood on the same side as her sister. \"Alright, you don't need to explain. After this matter is over, Mom will decide for us.\"\n\nWith a flash of movement, Nian Bing, along with Lan Chen and Feng Nü, and Xiluo, riding on Oscar's back, arrived in front of Xie Yue. Looking at the Seven Dragon Kings in front of him, Nian Bing shrugged helplessly. \"Brothers, I'm sorry, but it seems you won't be able to stop the ritual for opening the seal.\"\n\nKaji'osi couldn't help but let out a wry smile. He didn't even look at his own son, as if he didn't know Oscar at all. The Nian Bing couple, Xiluo in front of him, plus Xie Yue and the large number of undead powerhouses, plus Bing Ling and those ice and snow mages, there were at least six level thirteen powerhouses. Let alone their inability to disrupt the seal, even if Nian Bing and the others wanted to deal with the Seven Dragon Kings, their side would probably only result in a retreat.\n\nThe scene fell silent. The Seven Dragon Kings seemed to be contemplating something until Youyou's voice changed again, jolting them from their thoughts.\n\n\"Burn all things, flame! Hear my summons!\" Dark flames soared into the sky, turning into a sharp spear that pierced the blood-red gate. The gate opened a bit wider, and the golden light became even stronger. A dark red pattern appeared around the golden triangle on the gate.\n\nKaji'osi said with some dejection, \"It seems we cannot stop it. However, do not think that you can defy the will of the gods this way.\" As he spoke, he transformed into human form. Looking at Nian Bing, his gaze shifted slightly, and he subtly gave a signal.\n\nNian Bing was stunned and felt a sense of unease. At that very moment, a soft and effeminate voice seemed to sound from all directions simultaneously, \"It seems we will be the ones to resolve this in the end. I didn't expect this continent to have so many powerhouses.\"\n\nTwo illusory figures appeared from afar. As soon as Nian Bing's mental power detected their presence, they were still thousands of zhang away from the ice valley. However, by the time the last word of the effeminate voice was spoken, they had already appeared before him.\n\nThey were two men, one wearing red armor and the other black armor. The armor was made of crystalline minerals. Both men looked very ordinary. The man on the left was of medium build, with short gray hair that looked very spirited. Unfortunately, he had a large nose that disrupted the balance of his facial features, preventing him from being described as handsome. The only thing that could be considered unusual was his eyes. A sturdy man actually had a pair of peach blossom eyes, with rippling water in his eyes. He looked at Nian Bing with what he thought was a seductive gaze, making Nian Bing feel a chill. The other man beside him looked even more ordinary, with no distinguishing features, his eyes flashing with extremely yin energy. The aura of the two men was not strong, and their appearance did not bring any pressure. However, what the Seven Dragon Kings had said made Nian Bing's heart skip a beat.",

    "title": "Chapter 223: Killing the Lord’s Sorrow (Part 1)",
    "content": "\"Kajtheosis and his kin pay respects to the two Great Gods.\"\n\nGreat Gods! They were actually Great Gods? Nian Bing's heart trembled violently. He knew Kajtheosis was deliberately reminding him. Even Xie Yue's expression turned grim. On the Continent of Gods, the title of Great God was only for powerhouses of level fourteen and above. The Dragon God had told Nian Bing that most Great Gods were in slumber. Including himself, there were eight Great Gods. Some of them were replacements after the Great War of Divine Remnants ten thousand years ago. However, these Great Gods were at least ten thousand years old. Living for ten thousand years in a human body, their strength was probably only known to those of the same level on the Continent of Gods.\n\nThe effeminate voice spoke again. He seemed in no hurry to stop Youyou from completing the incantation. His eyes rippled as he smiled with his effeminate voice, \"Seven Dragon Kings, there's no need for politeness.\"\n\nKajtheosis said respectfully, \"I apologize, Great Gods. We are incompetent and unable to stop these humans before us.\"\n\n\"It's alright, you've done your best. The strength of these individuals was truly beyond our expectations. It seems the Continent of Aurora is also developing rapidly. Perhaps in a few short years, it will become another Lost Continent.\" As he spoke, a faint killing intent flashed in his eyes. \"Allow me to introduce myself. I am one of the eight Great Gods of the Continent of Gods, Valley Dragon of the God-Mourning Valley. This is Xia Yu of the God-Decay Shrine. With your strength, you should not have remained on this continent. As long as you are willing, I can guide you to the Continent of Gods and become one of the deities. As proud gods, you are far superior to being mere ordinary people here.\"\n\nNian Bing had calculated everything, but he never expected the Great Gods themselves to appear. However, things had progressed to this point, and he could not stop now. He could only place his hopes on Youyou's incantation finishing quickly. Although his companions and he were not as strong as the Great Gods, as long as they could stall until Youyou's incantation was complete, it would be enough.\n\nHe snorted disdainfully. Nian Bing said sarcastically, \"Continent of Gods? A member of the deities? To a place like yours, which is like hell? Lord God-Mourning, I'm afraid you only bring us misfortune.\"\n\nGod-Mourning Valley Dragon paused, his expression changing slightly. \"In that case, have you been to the Continent of Gods before?\" As he spoke, his gaze fell on the dwarf Xi Lu with some confusion. The flowing gaze suddenly became tangible. Xi Lu grunted, his body swaying slightly, and he took a step back on Oscar's back.\n\nNian Bing's eyes changed slightly. Among everyone present, even if Xi Lu wasn't the strongest, he was definitely in the top three. This God-Mourning only needed a glance to make Xi Lu retreat. His strength was indeed worthy of the title of Great God.\n\n\"Whether I've been there or not is for Lord God-Mourning to judge. I didn't expect that two Great Gods would be alarmed this time. It's truly our honor!\"\n\nValley Dragon rubbed the dust off his head, looked down at the red armor on his body, and smiled slightly. \"It seems our arrival was correct. You are much more troublesome than we imagined. Now, it's time for you to make a decision. I give you two choices: one, end the seal and return with us to the Continent of Gods, vowing to become a member of the deities; the other, death—\" He deliberately lengthened the word 'death', and his expression sank. \"You will all die.\"\n\nXi Lu roared, \"Death? Then teach me how to write that word. God-Slaying Slash.\" He swung his massive battle axe and leaped up from Oscar's back. The giant axe brought up a sky-shattering black rainbow and suddenly slashed towards God-Mourning Valley Dragon.\n\nNian Bing had seen Xi Lu's full power before. Seeing him suddenly move, he immediately unleashed his recovered mental energy. The Heavenly Eye Domain instantly enveloped Xi Lu's body, adding a bit more strength to him.\n\n\"Annihila—ting—Soul—Flame—Hear—My—Command—\" Youyou's voice changed once again at this moment. Black light surged from the mist behind Xie Yue and soared into the sky, merging with the giant blood-red gate. The gate opened a bit more. The golden triangle, with its dark red patterns, was immediately surrounded by a black halo.\n\nGod-Mourning Valley Dragon and God-Decay Xia Yu seemed unhurried, as if they hadn't heard Youyou's voice. Valley Dragon watched Xi Lu's attack, raised his right hand, and casually slapped out a palm, meeting Xi Lu's attack.\n\nThe axe light was almost instantly contained. The red airflow didn't seem to possess much power, but within the red airflow, a point of golden light was mixed. Although the golden light was small, it was exceptionally dazzling.\n\nBoom— The collision's shockwave rose into the sky, carrying Xi Lu with it. Xi Lu was blasted hundreds of feet into the sky. Although he gripped his battle axe tightly with both hands, the tiger's mouth had already split open, and the light on the God-Slaying Axe had dimmed considerably. Blood spurted from his mouth. When Xi Lu's body reached its highest point, he seemed to have lost consciousness, and his body tumbled down from the sky.\n\nNian Bing's Heavenly Eye Domain disappeared the moment they collided, shattered by the fierce, surging explosive force. Phoenix Girl soared up and caught Xi Lu. At this moment, the powerful dwarf warrior had fallen into a coma.\n\nSilence, a deathly silence. With just a casual blow, Xi Lu, who had attacked with all his might, was knocked into a coma. What kind of power did this represent?\n\nGod-Mourning Valley Dragon exclaimed, \"It seems I underestimated this dwarf. To be able to only be injured and not killed by my blow, hmm, it seems his strength is not just level thirteen. Now, it's not too late for you to change your minds. Although level thirteen is powerful, the gap between level thirteen and level fourteen is an insurmountable chasm.\"\n\nNian Bing didn't look at Xi Lu but stared intently at the God-Mourning before him, his eyes narrowed into slits. \"Ultimate Realm Royal Pole Acupoint, as expected of the strongest point.\" Others couldn't see it, but how could he, who possessed the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, not see it? When he saw the golden light in those two eyes, he had already judged that Xi Lu would have difficulty confronting Valley Dragon. The ultimate realm Royal Pole Acupoint was truly formidable, and there was a level of difference. Xi Lu had no chance at all.\n\nA level fourteen Great God, a Great God with the ultimate Royal Pole Acupoint, a Great God who had lived for ten thousand years, could they, his companions, contend with him? There was no answer. No one could tell Nian Bing the answer.\n\nValley Dragon's eyes flowed as he smiled, \"Since you know, what are you waiting for? I think the first choice is your most correct choice.\" Although his voice was effeminate, a fierce arrogance emanated from his core. Of course, he had the capital for such arrogance.\n\nNian Bing said helplessly, \"Alright, it seems we have no choice. Attack.\" He shouted the last two words, startling God-Mourning Valley Dragon and God-Decay Xia Yu. At this critical juncture, Xie Yue no longer had any selfish thoughts. His undead powerhouses charged forward immediately. Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye Domain, which had appeared again, had completely turned black. With two clear phoenix cries, one blue and one red, two phoenixes flew up simultaneously, attacking from two different directions. The space between Nian Bing's eyebrows also lit up, and golden light with immense pressure covered the two Great Gods. At the crucial moment, he couldn't afford to conserve his strength. To stall these two, he had to go all out.\n\nA clear and gentle chanting voice sounded. The giant ice lotus that had been stationary floated up, drawing an arc in the air as it descended towards the two Great Gods. At this moment, except for Xie Yue himself, everyone on Nian Bing's side who could attack had done so.\n\nJust as the Saint Master was about to charge out, he was stopped by Kajtheosis. Kajtheosis said in an extremely serious voice, \"With the strength of the Great Gods, do we still need to help? That would be the greatest insult to the two Great Gods.\"\n\nThe Saint Master was stunned, but he immediately understood that the Seven Dragon Kings had no intention of helping the two Great Gods. Just as they had not helped those gods and men when they first arrived.\n\n\"You are absolutely right. No wonder the Dragon God insisted on you becoming his successor.\" Valley Dragon's voice sounded. Amidst the combined attack of everyone, his and Xia Yu's bodies almost simultaneously disappeared.\n\nNian Bing's instant magic attack missed, and he immediately realized something. He shouted, \"Mom, be careful, it's the ultimate Earth Spirit Acupoint!\" Yes, these two Great Gods not only possessed the ultimate Royal Pole Acupoint but also the ultimate Earth Spirit Acupoint, which represented extremes. Only through the Heavenly Eye Acupoint could their movements be tracked. When Nian Bing's attack missed, the Heavenly Eye Acupoint had instantly judged the direction of the Great Gods' attack.\n\nThe mages of the Ice Spirit and the Ice God Tower continued their chanting. Two faint figures, almost a flash, arrived before them. God-Mourning Valley Dragon's golden light appeared again. This time, his target was Nian Bing's mother.\n\nThe giant ice lotus suddenly disappeared into thin air. When it reappeared, it was precisely at the moment of Valley Dragon's attack. The ultimate speed was teleportation, and a level fourteen magic, under the perfect control of the Ice Spirit, had actually reached the ultimate of speed.\n\nValley Dragon and Xia Yu had their reasons for choosing the Ice Spirit, as they both felt that in the current environment, the hundred mages led by the Ice Spirit possessed the strength to stall them. Therefore, the greatest threat had to be destroyed first. At the realm of Great Gods, their attack methods were simple, all of them slapped out a palm. However, Valley Dragon used his right hand, while Xia Yu used his left. As their hands struck out simultaneously, they met the ice lotus condensed by the full power of a hundred mages.\n\n\"Mom—\" Nian Bing instantly transferred himself towards the battlefield. However, at the center of the collision, all the magic elements were distorted. The position where he appeared deviated from the original trajectory. The fierce collision still occurred.\n\nHaloes drifted outwards. Almost instantly, the ice valley disappeared. The entire ice valley completely vanished. What the gods and men hadn't done earlier was accomplished by the full fight between the two Great Gods and the mages led by the Ice Spirit. The shockwave of the explosion caused by that ring, due to the vacuum in the center, allowed Cat Cat and her pets, as well as the gods and men fighting with the pets, to be spared. However, the surrounding glaciers completely disappeared, the ground became flat, as if this place had originally been a smooth ice plain.\n\nGod-Mourning Valley Dragon and God-Decay Xia Yu's bodies only trembled slightly before returning to calm. But the hundred ice mages spurted blood simultaneously. The Ice Spirit, who was leading, turned pale. White light flashed in her chest and abdomen. If she hadn't activated the West Pole Acupoint to absorb a large amount of innate ice essence, and if it hadn't been in the current environment, the ultimate Royal Pole Acupoint burst attack from the two Great Gods would have been enough to make the mages, led by her, disappear like the glaciers. Although they had resisted the attack, the ice lotus had also disappeared. At the same time, the Ice Spirit was severely injured, her vision went black, and she couldn't even maintain the blizzard beneath her, her body falling straight down.\n\nNian Bing, in time, hugged his mother, who was barely breathing. An unprecedented grief and anger surged from his chest. He poured his life essence into his mother without reservation. His eyes had turned blood red. He roared, \"Oscar.\"\n\nA gray figure appeared beside Nian Bing. The next moment, Nian Bing carefully placed his mother on Oscar's back.\n\nValley Dragon and Xia Yu didn't care about Nian Bing's feelings. Seeing that the Ice Spirit was no longer able to fight, they wouldn't bother with the mages who were as weak as ants. The two of them separated, one lunging towards Youyou's direction, and the other heading straight for Nian Bing. From their simple contact, they had already seen that Nian Bing was the leader of this group. Killing him was necessary.\n\n\"Eter—nal—Blazing—Flame—Hear—My—Command—\" Purple flames rose into the sky amidst Youyou's chanting. This was the fourth color of flame. That dark red gate was now half open. Youyou chanted this incantation very quickly because, shrouded by the mist scattered by Xie Yue, no one could see his current appearance.\n\nNian Bing stood straight in the air, looking coldly at God-Mourning Valley Dragon who had arrived before him. \"You hurt my mother.\"\n\nValley Dragon smiled at Nian Bing, \"So what?\"\n\nNian Bing's red eyes revealed a terrifying gleam. \"When I was little, someone took away my mother's love. It wasn't until recently that I saw my mother again. I secretly vowed then that no one could take my mother away from me again, not even true gods.\"\n\nValley Dragon looked at the faint light flashing between Nian Bing's eyebrows. \"With your Heavenly Eye Acupoint alone? Perhaps, in a few hundred years, you too can become a master of my level. However, it is likely you who will die now.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing smiled, a somewhat ferocious smile. \"Oh? Then I'll take a gamble.\"\n\n\"Gamble?\" Gu Long looked at Nian Bing in surprise. Since arriving on this continent, the Brilliance Continent had rekindled a heart that had been dormant for many years. He believed that the God of Misfortune, Xia Yu, on the other side would not allow the process of breaking the seal to continue, so he was not in a hurry to kill Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Yes, a gamble. A gamble on my own destiny, and a gamble on yours.\" His blood-red eyes suddenly returned to normal. The next moment, the light on his forehead suddenly flared, and golden light spread out limitlessly. Nian Bing and Gu Long heard a cracking sound almost simultaneously, and then Nian Bing's body trembled.\n\n\"Four - Realm - Flames - Descend - Upon - Me -\" You You's voice, quickening its pace, rang out again. This time, from the massive blood-red gate in the sky, the four-colored flames that had risen earlier descended together. The mist scattered by Xie Yue actually dispersed, revealing You You in the air.\n\nYou You had changed. Four-colored flames blazed around her body. She was like a queen of flames, her hands reverting to claw shapes and clasped in front of her chest, while the blood-red sphere of light filled all the space between her claws.\n\nXia Yu's strength was indeed terrifying. Whether it was Lan Chen, who had transformed into a phoenix, or Feng Nü, or the powerful King of Darkness, Xie Yue, they could all clearly feel the vast gap between the fourteenth and thirteenth tiers. When Xia Yu reappeared, he tore the Vampire King, the Zombie King, and those necromancers to shreds with his surging battle qi, which was like divine power. They couldn't even get close to him. Feng Nü and Lan Chen had both been repelled. Xie Yue's bloodthirsty absorption had turned into blood-red light spots. His full-powered undead magic was completely immune to the formidable battle qi of a fourteenth-tier being.\n\nXia Yu's body merely swayed slightly before he appeared before You You. He sent a punch from afar towards You You, who was burning with four-colored flames. At this moment, Xie Yue, Lan Chen, and Feng Nü were all powerless to stop him. The attacks from the ice mages who had landed far away could only turn into ice dust before the God of Misfortune's battle qi. His left fist, shining with golden light, projected a golden figure. It was about to rush into the range of the Moordas Seal Bottle.\n\nYou You showed no expression. She looked up at the great gate in the sky. She had completely lost control of her body and could only continue with the incantation. The golden fist shadow, filled with the aura of death, had arrived.\n\n*Pfft*. The golden fist shadow disappeared. You You was still chanting, and the light column formed by the Moordas Seal Bottle was not affected in the slightest. However, outside the light column, another figure appeared, blocking the golden fist shadow.\n\n\"Sina!\" Xie Yue roared, his body flickering as he caught the figure. It was the Vampire Queen, who had not appeared until now. Relying on her Shadow Stealth, she had been guarding You You all along, precisely to prevent anyone from disrupting the incantation.\n\n\"Why, why are you so foolish?\" Xie Yue's eyes were actually a little moist.\n\nSina revealed a bitter smile. \"She is our daughter! Our only daughter. Xie Yue, do you know? I don't love you for your power or strength; I love you. For the sake of fulfilling your wish, what is my life worth?\" With a self-mocking smile, Xie Yue watched his wife's body turn into a puff of dust and drift away. He was stunned. His body trembled. an evil aura surged, and his heart ached violently. Only now did he realize that his cold heart could actually hurt.\n\n*Boom, boom*. The God of Misfortune Xia Yu repelled Feng Nü and Lan Chen with two punches respectively. Once again, they were hit hard at the Emperor's Cavity. The two women had already reverted to their original human forms in the air; they were not truly phoenixes yet. Blood flowed from the corners of their mouths. Heavily injured, they could only rely on their Royal Feathers to maintain their position in the air. They had learned from Lu's lesson before and tried not to engage Xia Yu head-on, which allowed them to last. But now You You was in danger, and they had to attack with all their might, yet the result was still unbearable. A fourteenth-tier deity was too powerful.\n\n\"Five - Realm - Flames - Meet - My - Enemy -\"\n\nXia Yu's figure flashed as he bypassed Xie Yue and delivered another punch towards You You. He wasn't afraid of Xie Yue, but he didn't want to waste time. Xie Yue, at this moment, was still embracing his wife, completely lost in a daze, and did not notice Xia Yu's figure at all. He only muttered to himself, \"Is it worth it? Is all of this worth it?\"\n\nXia Yu was about to succeed, but at this moment, the blood-red light sphere in You You's hand suddenly ignited. It was crystal-clear red flames, burning alongside the other four-colored flames around her body. The Five Realms Flames, yes, they were the Five Realms Flames.\n\nThe golden fist shadow disappeared as it entered the Moordas Seal Bottle, disappearing within the Five Realms Flames. Xia Yu was slightly stunned. Just as he was about to launch another attack, the Five Realms Flames soared into the sky and moved towards the blood-red gate in the heavens. At this moment, breaking the seal had reached its final crucial point. And the instant the Five Realms Flames ascended, Xia Yu, with all his might, was sent flying back.\n\nOn the other side, the God of Slaughter, Gu Long, had fallen into panic. The moment the golden light emanating from Nian Bing's forehead spread throughout his body, a terrifying aura suddenly descended upon Gu Long. Realizing something was amiss, he could no longer wait and immediately attacked Nian Bing. The attack from the Ultimate Emperor's Cavity struck Nian Bing like lightning.\n\nHowever, what met Gu Long's attack was also a golden lightning bolt.\n\nAmidst the violent roars, Nian Bing still floated there, but his body was no longer trembling. Gu Long, however, was repelled more than thirty feet away. Nian Bing's eyes had turned golden at some point. \"I want to try the feeling of killing a god.\" Substantial golden light shot out from his forehead almost instantly. Even Gu Long's Ultimate Earth Spirit Cavity could not allow him to dodge. He struck out with his right hand again, but he was horrified to find that his invincible Emperor's Cavity was penetrated by that faint golden light. Immediately after, Gu Long's body froze. He stared blankly at Nian Bing, his eyes filled with disbelief.\n\nGolden flames continuously spewed from Nian Bing's seven orifices. His golden eyes were filled with ferocity.\n\n*Bang*! Gu Long's head exploded into pieces, brain matter splattering as he died. His body, unprotected by energy, was frozen in an ice dragon whirlwind, then torn to shreds.\n\nWith a flash, Nian Bing appeared before You You, just in time to meet the returning God of Misfortune Xia Yu. Xia Yu's mind was fully focused on destroying the seal and did not expect Nian Bing to arrive in time. He looked at Nian Bing, who was blocking his path and emitting a golden light that filled him with fear, with confusion. \"Where is Gu Long?\"\n\n\"Dead.\" Nian Bing's voice sounded as if it came from hell.\n\nAt this moment, the Five Realms Flames had risen high into the sky and imprinted themselves on the blood-red gate. The gate finally opened, and You You began her final incantation.\n\n\"Heaven - and - Earth - Return - to - Chaos - Within - the - Forbidden - Realm's - Fang - Huang - Ba - Yan - Array - In - splendor - open - it - Moordas's - Seal.\"\n\nAs You You began her final incantation, another golden light drifted out from Nian Bing's forehead and shot towards Xia Yu. Although he did not speak, his gaze was filled with intense killing intent. Xia Yu saw the golden eye that opened on Nian Bing's forehead and suddenly realized something. He roared, and a golden light burst from his left arm. Blood and golden light mixed. He actually severed his own arm with the Emperor's Cavity. A massive golden energy from his head merged with the sudden white light to meet that golden light. Xia Yu himself retreated without any hesitation, disappearing from everyone's sight in an instant.\n\nThe golden light disappeared without a sound, and Xia Yu's arm also vanished simultaneously. Nian Bing floated there quietly, unmoving. The golden light on his forehead flickered continuously, with a brief pause each time it flickered. The killing intent in his eyes gradually receded. Until the last moment before he lost consciousness, he did not turn back to look at You You, who was chanting the final incantation.\n\nOscar's massive body appeared beneath Nian Bing at the fastest speed. Just then, Nian Bing fell. He fell peacefully, landing right beside his mother and falling into a deep sleep, still enveloped in golden light. Oscar, who was connected to him through his heart, could feel the strange aura on Nian Bing. That aura seemed to belong neither to material energy nor to mental power, but to a peculiar mixed energy. Although Nian Bing was unconscious, enveloped in golden light, his aura was stable and powerful, showing no signs of injury.\n\nThe battle below had also entered its final stage. In Fox's extremely potent Fox Fart Domain, Mao Mao's pets erupted with strong combat power. In the stalemate, both Mao Mao's pets and the six deities were sustaining increasing injuries. However, these pets were too massive, and their defensive power was astonishing. The deities, while activating their cavities, were also affected by the stench, weakening their combat power. Every time they tried to concentrate their efforts to kill one or two demonic beasts, they would invariably draw the frenzied attacks of all the demonic beasts. In just a quarter of an hour, the pets' attacks grew fiercer, while their defenses gradually weakened as the immense energy from activating their cavities subsided. They themselves were hoping that the Seven Dragon Kings and the main gods would come to their rescue. However, the Dragon Kings and main gods who appeared one after another did not even glance at them, leaving them to be besieged by the demonic beasts.\n\nFinally, the six deities breathed a sigh of relief. The extremely foul smell disappeared, and the demonic beasts before them all reverted to their original appearances, seeming much weaker. They merely surrounded the area and ceased their attacks. At that moment, the deities, having gained a moment to breathe, looked up at the sky. Although activating their cavities had caused them significant losses, if their leader, the Main God, succeeded, the situation would surely change. However, when they looked up at the sky, they happened to witness Nian Bing suddenly erupting with unbelievable power, instantly causing two Main Gods to die and escape.\n\nThe six deities were stunned for a moment, and then they all made the same choice. They gathered all their remaining energy and flew towards the sky, wanting to quickly escape this terrifying place. If even their boss had fled, what good future could they expect by staying here?\n\nMao Mao was a pure-hearted little girl. At any other time, she would have found it difficult to resort to a massacre. However, today was different. She had seen the six deities being besieged by demonic beasts before, in the territory of the White Race. These six deities had each had the blood of the White Race on their hands. When a pure little girl erupts, she can be very terrifying.\n\nThe divine beasts, led by Guan Guan, had lost most of their offensive power due to excessive consumption of their potential. Their weakness was no less than that of the deities. However, just as the six deities were about to fly up, they all felt a pain in their brains, and their battle qi was instantly interrupted, causing them to fall back to the ground. A faint silver light sealed the sky. Mao Mao was no longer the Mao Mao of the past. At this moment, she had inherited the mental power of her parents. The unique mental magic of the White Race absolutely had a sealing effect on the weakened deities.\n\nThe demonic beasts slowly parted to the sides. The earth trembled with dull thuds. A colossal figure appeared before the deities. They were shocked to see that it was a pure golden figure. Yes, pure gold. A massive body, exuding infinite pressure. With every step it took, they felt an incredibly powerful pressure. They were certain it was a dragon, but unlike the appearance of the Dragon Kings. Although this dragon's wings were broad, its body was even more enormous. Even the Seven Dragon Kings in the sky could not compare to its massive size. Its golden body was covered in extremely thick scales. Seven spikes, each half a zhang long, grew from its back. A long dragon tail trailed behind it, with nine forked tips curled upwards at the end. Its entire body emitted a faint golden light. Seated on the back of this colossal dragon was a little girl. Her body, accentuated by the golden light, appeared so pure. However, at this moment, her large eyes were filled with killing intent.\n\nThe deities had a sense of déjà vu from this colossal dragon. When they had faced the Golden-Backed Earth Dragon King before, Jinbei Dilongwang Xiao Jieba had not yet evolved into its current form. Now, not only had its size changed, but the powerful aura surrounding its body was also far more imposing than before.",

    "content": "That young girl was known to all of them; she was none other than a survivor of the Human race. Connecting this with the magical beasts surrounding them, they immediately understood who their opponents were.\n\nMaomao's eyes flashed with cold light, and the little stutterer's heavy steps suddenly quickened. It charged directly at the six Divine beings. Its massive wings spread to the sides like two giant cleavers, and its dragon tail stood erect.\n\nThe Divine beings, weakened from their spiritual burst, could only show despair in their eyes. At this moment, no one could save them. Their fate, like that of the Humans they had slaughtered, was only the final end.\n\nNine golden lights shot out simultaneously from the little stutterer's tail. In an instant, nine Divine beings spurted blood and were sent flying. They couldn't dodge these energy impacts, which were several times faster than lightning. The last scene they saw in their lives was a golden body rapidly expanding above their own.\n\nYuyou's body, floating in the air, suddenly trembled slightly. A deep sorrow showed in her large eyes, which had returned to black. A faint bloody aura continuously rose, and cracking sounds echoed. The seven Orodath Seal Bottles below her body simultaneously shattered. Seven black streams of air merged into Yuyou's body almost simultaneously. Following this, Yuyou formed a hand seal with her hands and imprinted it onto the air. The black streams of air transformed into a giant golden symbol in the air, creating a trail of afterimages as it merged into the vast space beyond the already opened blood-red gate. No one knew what that dark space was, but Yuyou's incantation to open the seal was finally complete.\n\nThe blood-red sky seemed to tremble slightly. Then, in the fluctuations of the blood-red gate opened in mid-air, the black abyss turned golden. All evil aura vanished completely at this moment. Golden light shone down, directly upon Yuyou. Yuyou closed her eyes, just as Xie Yue had said. She was now to become the true sacrifice.\n\nXie Yue stared blankly at his daughter bathed in golden light, his gaze filled with endless sorrow. He clearly saw a crystal tear slide down from his only daughter's eyes. The tear was so pure; she was crying.\n\nXie Yue suddenly felt as if he had lost everything, his body and mind completely hollow. His plan had succeeded, but in his heart, there was no trace of the excitement and joy he should have felt. There was only sorrow.\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings moved at this moment, surrounding Xie Yue. Oscar, carrying Nian Bing, arrived beside Yuyou's pillar of light. Xie Yue did not resist as the Seven Dragon Kings had expected; instead, he floated there blankly, looking up at his daughter in the sky. A hint of clarity gradually appeared in his eyes. His hands remained in the position they were in when he held Serna.\n\nThe golden light continued to shine, and the blood-red light in the sky also kept fluctuating. Everyone waited silently, each with their own thoughts. The Seven Dragon Kings stared at Xie Yue, and they were surprised to find that the Evil Lord no longer exuded any evil aura. His gaze upon Yuyou was filled with guilt and apology. He did not move, muttering words to himself, not chanting, but rather as if praying.\n\nThe golden light receded, and the earth trembled. A slight earthquake occurred at this time, much like the fluctuating blood-red light in the sky, it was constantly quivering.\n\nSuddenly, the giant blood-red gate in the sky gradually faded. A little color returned to Yuyou's pale face, and the evil aura was replaced by a divine aura. A black ball of light appeared on her chest, and her body was enveloped by a layer of golden light. No one knew what had happened, but everyone was certain that the seal had been opened, and the Lost Continent was returning to this world through a process unknown to them.\n\nThe pillar of light produced by the Orodath Seal Bottles vanished, and the blood-red gate in the sky also disappeared. Sunlight shone upon the earth, bringing vitality to all things. The cold air from the ice cave below also stopped emanating. Although the surrounding temperature was still very low, everyone felt a hint of warmth.\n\n\"She's not dead, Yuyou is not dead.\" Xie Yue's body trembled with excitement as he watched his daughter fall from the sky and be held by the Holy Master. His eyes became misty. Crystal tears rolled down from the eyes of this master of evil.\n\nDark Dragon King Ka Jiesi frowned. \"Xie Yue, the ritual is complete. Did you just become the new master of the Lost Continent?\" His words carried a hint of sarcasm. As a controller of dark energy himself, he knew that the promised ritual within the curse had to be fulfilled, but the imagined ritual had not appeared. Although Yuyou had fallen into a coma, her life was clearly still present.\n\nXie Yue gave a bitter smile. \"No, I don't know. I only know that after the curse ends, the Lost Continent will return. I thought that when the curse was lifted and the seal broken, there would be some unusual phenomenon that would give me an opportunity to become the master of the Lost Continent. But it seems I was wrong. My daughter is not dead, and I have not become the master of the Lost Continent. That legendary attachment is probably fake. Perhaps the oath of the former ruler of the Lost Continent was just an empty promise. However, I feel no disappointment now. I am very fortunate that at least my daughter is alive. I know you all have great animosity towards me, kill me if you wish. But, as a father, I beg you, spare my daughter. She has never done anything evil. All the fault is mine, and I am willing to exchange my life for my daughter's life.\"\n\nThe Seven Dragon Kings were stunned. Was this still the master of evil? He would actually say such words, even choose self-sacrifice? Everyone looked at Xie Yue with disbelief, but they saw a sense of calm in his eyes.\n\nKa Jiesi looked into Xie Yue's eyes, then at the position his hands were still in, and understood something. He nodded and said, \"No matter what, it has already happened. I don't want to know what you did before. Congratulations. You have walked out of darkness. Take your daughter and go.\"\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\n\"No, we can't let him go...\" The other Dragon Kings shouted in surprise. Xie Yue had almost led them to eternal damnation last time and had nearly killed Oscar. They were unwilling to let him go. Dimante held her husband's hand and looked at him deeply. \"Are you really sure?\"\n\nKa Jiesi nodded firmly. \"He's like I was. After a moment of enlightenment, he lost everything from before. He has been reborn. It's just that he was not as fortunate as I. He only realized it at the moment his wife died. Back then, since Lord Dragon God could forgive my past sins and give me a chance at rebirth, why can't I give him such a chance? Although he may have killed many people, when he becomes a good person, the good side he can bring to the human world will be immense. Rather than kill him, it's better to let him use the rest of his life to atone for his past sins. Xie Yue, I think you understand what I mean.\"\n\nXie Yue looked at Ka Jiesi, felt the immense dragon aura emanating from him, and his eyes were filled with deep sorrow. \"Yes, you are right. I woke up too late. I pursued my dreams for many years, but I neglected what was most precious to me. The moment Serna died, my ambitions shattered. I don't know why, but all the past events in my heart disappeared like smoke. In fact, I would be happy if you killed me, because then I could go to see Serna.\"\n\nKa Jiesi sighed softly. \"No, we won't kill you. If you truly feel you were wrong before, then you need to repent through your actions. I hope you understand what I mean. You lost your wife, but you still have your daughter. I believe you won't let your daughter walk the same path you did in the past. Take your daughter and go, do what a father should do.\"\n\nXie Yue shook his head. \"Thank you, Dark Dragon King. Thank you for giving me a chance at rebirth. However, I will not take Yuyou. I am not worthy of being her father. I was willing to sacrifice my daughter to fulfill my dream. From that moment on, I was no longer worthy of being her father. I beg you, when she wakes up, tell her that her father has followed her mother. If she wants to hate, let her hate me. I will pray for Yuyou wherever I am.\" He glanced at Yuyou in the Holy Master's arms, then suddenly, Xie Yue backhanded his own right shoulder, tearing off his right arm. No blood gushed out; black mist prevented it from flowing.\n\nHis actions startled the Seven Dragon Kings, but Xie Yue did not flinch. He held his right arm with his left hand and presented it to Ka Jiesi. Although his forehead was covered in cold sweat, he did not even groan.\n\nKa Jiesi frowned. \"What are you doing?\"\n\nXie Yue calmly glanced at them. \"If I were still the Xie Yue of the past, none of you would have left here alive today. But I am no longer the Evil Lord. I give you my right arm, but be careful not to release what's inside. I believe you will know how to handle it. I'm leaving. Please take care of my daughter. Whatever she chooses in the future, let it be. Her lover is over there, sealed by my magic. Thank you, Seven, for forgiving my crimes.\" With a deep bow, Xie Yue drifted away, enveloped in black mist, leaving nothing behind.\n\nKa Jiesi was taken aback and looked at the other Dragon Kings. At this time, the somewhat recovered Phoenix Woman and Lan Chen had flown over. The Phoenix Woman said, \"Let's leave this place first. However, this ice valley needs to be repaired. Otherwise, if the cold current erupts from the ice eye again, it will affect the continent.\"\n\nDragon Spirit had already flown over while Ka Jiesi was talking to Xie Yue, looking at Nian Bing and Ice Spirit with concern beside Oscar. Hearing the Phoenix Woman's words, he quickly said, \"Leave this to me. Although those two True Gods injured me and the other magicians, our strength is still there. In this environment, only we ice-elemental magicians can survive better. I believe that within a certain period, we can restore the ice valley to its original state.\" One hundred ice-elemental magicians, in this icy and snowy environment, indeed possessed such strength, although it would take a considerable amount of time.\n\nTwo days later, Ice Moon Empire, Ice Moon City.\n\nAs Nian Bing's consciousness gradually recovered, he felt warmth around him. The chaotic thoughts in his mind gradually straightened out as his consciousness became clearer. When he opened his eyes, he found himself in a spacious room. The room was warm, and he was lying on a wide bed. The room's decor was very exquisite. On the table by the bed, there was an incense burner emitting a faint, pleasant fragrance.\n\nHow did I get here? Is everything over? He hadn't seen the final scene, but he vaguely remembered what had happened. Amidst his confusion, he quickly checked his body and was surprised to find that his body had changed again, with the most significant change being his brain.\n\nAt that time, facing the situation where two Main Gods had harmed his mother, Nian Bing's brain was filled with hot blood. At that moment, all he wanted was to protect his mother and avenge her. Under those circumstances, if the two Main Gods had continued their attacks, let alone the completion of the ritual to break the seal, not a single human present would have survived. Therefore, Nian Bing told the Dragon of God-Mourning Valley that he was going to take a gamble, a gamble with his life. The facts proved that his gamble paid off.\n\nWhat was Nian Bing gambling on? He was gambling on his dual-aperture-combined Sky Eye Aperture. There, not only was the Sky Eye Aperture, but also a Royal Extreme Aperture. Both had reached their ultimate aperture state and were broken through by Nian Bing's spiritual power in an instant. He chose to detonate the aperture. Yes, he detonated his strongest dual apertures. At that time, Nian Bing could no longer consider the consequences. He knew that with the ultimate realm of the Sky Eye Aperture and the Royal Extreme Aperture, as long as he could obtain any of the energy produced by the aperture detonation during the explosion, it would pose a threat to the two Main Gods. Therefore, he chose to gamble. He firmly believed that he would not die, as long as there was pure life energy in his chest, he would not die unless his body was completely shattered. Thus, he chose to detonate the aperture.",

    "content": "When the acupoints of the 'Burst' exploded,\n\nNian Bing didn't feel the imagined pain, nor did he see the blood splatter as other divine beings did when their acupoints burst. As he used all his mental power to break through the Heavenly Eye acupoint, he was surprised to find that his restricted mental power had returned. Furthermore, within his mental power, there was an additional peculiar energy. What made Nian Bing even more delighted was that the Imperial acupoint had separated from the Heavenly Eye acupoint at the moment of its explosion. This allowed him to unleash powerful strength in his first attack against Gu Long.\n\nNot only did the Heavenly Eye acupoint contain the power of the Imperial acupoint, but the Imperial acupoint also contained the power of the Heavenly Eye acupoint. When the energy of the Imperial acupoint instantly erupted, Nian Bing clearly felt that the golden light generated by the Imperial acupoint could instantly analyze the strength and weakness of Gu Long's attack energy. He struck the strong points and avoided the weak ones, repelling Gu Long. Immediately after, without hesitation, he launched a materialized mental power attack. It was an exhilarating and extremely dangerous attack. Gu Long's fourteenth-level power was difficult to contend with. Nian Bing knew that his only advantage was his mental power. Otherwise, even if he possessed the ultimate Imperial acupoint, he would not be able to defeat Gu Long. Therefore, at the moment Gu Long was surprised, similar golden light appeared. Because everything happened too quickly, Gu Long, without time to think, met it with his own Imperial acupoint.\n\nHowever, mental power and battle qi are two completely different concepts. His Imperial acupoint attack was easily penetrated by mental power. As a result, Gu Long died. Of course, even with Nian Bing's materialized mental power attack, he wouldn't have been killed so easily. But in that situation, due to his own psychological changes, he was actually killed instantly by Nian Bing.\n\nNo, Nian Bing was not in a good state either. Although the materialized mental power attack was effective, if the enemy's mental power was stronger than his, then he would be the one whose head would burst. Gu Long's mental power was not comparable to Nian Bing's, but he had existed for tens of thousands of years. Nian Bing killed him in one blow, and his own mental power also suffered a severe shock. But in that situation, Nian Bing had no time to stop. Therefore, he immediately appeared before the decadent god Xia Yu and launched another materialized mental power attack. Although Xia Yu hadn't said a word from beginning to end, his judgment was clearly superior to Gu Long's. When he saw the golden eye on Nian Bing's forehead, he understood immediately. Seizing the opportunity, he spontaneously exploded the Imperial acupoint in his left arm, using the moment of explosion to escape the scene.\n\nActually, Xia Yu was being overly cautious. In that situation, Nian Bing's mental power had already suffered considerable damage. Even if Xia Yu had not been defensive, if he had chosen to flee directly, Nian Bing might not have been able to pursue him. However, to preserve his life, Xia Yu chose the most secure method, which resulted in his body suffering heavy injuries.\n\nNo, after repelling him, Nian Bing's mental power also suffered a violent shock due to the combined attack of Xia Yu's Imperial acupoint and his own mental power. Coupled with the previous injuries to his body, he directly fainted.\n\nRecalling what happened when he was unconscious, Nian Bing couldn't help but show a faint smile. Killing one main god and repelling another with his own strength was a situation that probably hadn't even occurred during the Divine Remnants Great War. Now, Nian Bing clearly felt that the Heavenly Eye and Imperial acupoints in his forehead had merged into one.\n\nBut, unlike before, as long as his will moved, the materialized mental power attack still existed. Furthermore, he could unleash different attacks according to his will. They could be materialized mental power, or they could be materialized energy belonging to the Imperial acupoint. This change had unknowingly increased Nian Bing's strength significantly. Now, even if he encountered a main god again, he would have nothing to fear.\n\nHis body also seemed to have undergone some changes. A faint golden light flowed under his skin, and his internal magic power seemed to have become more overbearing, directly forming a connection with the outside world following his will. What made Nian Bing most excited was that this dual acupoint explosion did not produce the usual side effects of acupoint explosion. It was as if his two acupoints had never exploded. Furthermore, the Xijing acupoint's ability had been enhanced under the influence of their explosion. He thought that this time, he had indeed benefited from misfortune.\n\nAfter a moment of joy, Nian Bing quickly calmed down. The first thing he thought of was the result after the final seal was opened. A thoughtful light appeared in his eyes. His body moved, and he sat up from the bed. His whole body felt light, and his head felt slightly dizzy. He stood up and moved his body slightly in the room. He immediately felt much more comfortable. He didn't know how long he had been lying down this time; his blood circulation was inevitably a bit sluggish.\n\nJust then, footsteps approached from outside. The energy in Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye acupoint stirred slightly. His mental power became his eyes, and he saw Feng Nü and Lan Chen walking towards his room together. He quickly got back into bed and lay down in the covers.\n\nThe door opened, and Feng Nü and Lan Chen entered, each carrying a tray. The expressions on both their faces were somewhat solemn. They walked to the bed and placed the trays down. Feng Nü carefully lifted the quilt and sighed, \"You rascal. You've been unconscious for more than ten days. Why aren't you waking up?\"\n\nLan Chen smiled and said, \"Sister, don't worry. Elder Kajetos said Nian Bing's body is perfectly fine and hasn't been harmed at all. He will definitely wake up.\"\n\nFeng Nü said, \"You always know how to speak. Can't I see the worry in your heart? Nian Bing and that girl Youyou are both capable. It's been more than ten days since we returned to Ice Moon City, and neither of them has woken up. Now that the Lost Continent may have returned to this world, who knows what the situation is over there. Now that Nian Bing hasn't woken up, how can we rush over?\"\n\nLan Chen sighed and said, \"Let's wait a little longer. Mom's injuries have almost healed. Ling'er has probably finished repairing the Ice Valley. If Nian Bing still hasn't woken up by then, we can only go to the Lost Continent to take a look first. Fortunately, Nian Bing made preparations in advance, asking the Ice and Oran kingdoms to send heavy troops to guard Heavenly Dang Mountain, so we can feel a little more at ease.\"\n\nFeng Nü carefully helped Nian Bing take off his clothes and picked up a warm towel from the basin on the tray, wiping Nian Bing's firm chest. \"Sister, you feed him.\"\n\nLan Chen agreed and picked up a spoon from the tray she brought. A faint blush appeared on her face. She drank a sip herself first, then leaned over to Nian Bing's mouth, kissed his lips, and carefully fed him. A wisp of innate energy accompanied by the aroma of food entered Nian Bing's mouth. With the effect of the innate energy, the food was sent into Nian Bing's abdomen.\n\n\"Mmm, it tastes really good! It should be the taste of ginseng chicken soup. It's really nourishing! But, Chenchen's cool, soft lips taste even better.\"\n\nAfter the great battle, savoring the delicious food brought by his beloved wife through her mouth made Nian Bing's heart fill with warmth. He subconsciously kissed Lan Chen's lips back, unwilling to let go. Lan Chen felt Nian Bing's response. Her delicate body trembled, and she immediately hugged Nian Bing's neck and responded passionately. Her husband's awakening filled her with joy.\n\n\"Nian Bing, you're awake!\" Feng Nü also felt the change in Nian Bing's body. Nian Bing finally realized what was happening and released Lan Chen, letting her move away from him. Looking at the two beautiful sisters before him, he showed a satisfied smile. Lan Chen's pretty face flushed slightly, and she looked at Nian Bing and asked softly, \"How are you? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?\"\n\nNian Bing sat up, putting an arm around each sister, and said, \"No. I just ate your spirit, how could I feel uncomfortable? Leaning in Nian Bing's warm embrace, Feng Nü and Lan Chen's worried hearts finally relaxed. During their tender moment, neither of them spoke. After a while, Feng Nü seemed to remember something, suddenly broke free from Nian Bing's embrace, and said angrily, \"Tell me, how should we punish you?\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned and said with a fawning smile, \"Feng Nü, you haven't forgotten yet! You know I just woke up, and my body is still weak. Can we be exempted from this punishment?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not! You actually abandoned us and ran off alone. Do you think you can escape punishment?\" Lan Chen also struggled out of Nian Bing's embrace, looking at Nian Bing with a hint of annoyance.\n\nNian Bing said with a wry smile, \"Actually, it wasn't that I did it intentionally. It's just that the timing was a bit inconvenient.\"\n\nFeng Nü snorted and said, \"Don't try to play dumb with us. Don't you think I know what you're thinking? Nian Bing, I know you were afraid we would be in danger, but have you ever thought about it? If something happened to you, what would we do?\"\n\nSeeing Feng Nü's eyes redden slightly, Nian Bing felt a surge of guilt. \"I'm sorry, it was my fault. I promise, there won't be a next time.\"\n\nLan Chen looked at Nian Bing's embarrassed expression and couldn't help but chuckle, saying, \"You still want a next time? Look, our punishment should be stricter.\"\n\n\"Wow! No way!\" Feng Nü said with a smile, \"This is good. Our punishment can't be too severe. After all, your body is still very weak.\" She deliberately emphasized the word \"weak.\" \"Since your body is so weak, for a certain period, you're not allowed to be intimate with us, lest you strain your injuries. This punishment is very light.\"\n\nNian Bing asked blankly, \"How long is this 'certain period'? Actually, my body is not that weak. Intimacy hasn't been mentioned yet. Don't you know that intimacy can promote blood circulation and help with healing?\"\n\nFeng Nü snorted and said, \"You wish! Since you're weak, you should rest well. As for this 'certain period,' it depends on your performance. If you perform well, perhaps I'll lift the ban in a year.\"\n\n\"What?!\" Nian Bing exclaimed in shock. \"Perform well and it'll still be a year? You might as well kill me. Looking at the delicious food in front of me but being unable to taste it, I can't stand this feeling.\"\n\nFeng Nü and Lan Chen's faces flushed simultaneously. Lan Chen said, \"Okay, we'll see your performance.\"\n\nNian Bing saw that Lan Chen was softening and knew that they were mostly joking with him. He took the hands of the two women and said with a smile, \"How do you know where I went? I never told you where I was going.\"\n\nFeng Nü smiled and said, \"You can never escape our grasp in this lifetime. If you don't tell me, won't we ask? The day you left, Ling'er and I felt something was wrong. After you left, I and Ling'er also set off for the Ice God Valley. There, with Father and Mother, we guessed what you were going to do. Time still flows. Although we don't know where you went, as long as we find the seven Dragon Kings, we can naturally find you.\"\n\nNian Bing suddenly understood. He realized that the seven Dragon Kings had betrayed him. His thoughts stirred, and he said, \"Then, did you go to the Ice Valley with the seven Dragon Kings? But their purpose was completely different from ours. Didn't they stop you?\"\n\nLan Chen chuckled and said, \"Silly. If the seven Dragon Kings really wanted to stop you, do you think the last seal could have been opened smoothly?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred, and he suddenly understood something. Just then, a deep voice came from outside, \"This time, let me introduce myself to you. You'll understand. Come in.\"\n\nThe Fire Dragon King, Galamantis, walked in with a smile. Seeing Nian Bing had recovered, his excitement was no less than Feng Nü's or Lan Chen's. Feng Nü quickly made way and invited Galamantis to sit down. Galamantis looked at Nian Bing and said slowly, \"Actually, a month before that ritual was opened, those divine beings found me. On the surface, we belong to the Divine Continent. Moreover, two main gods came at that time. At their request, we could not refuse and came together to prevent the opening of the seal bottle of Mo'audas' seal. However...\" Speaking of this, Galamantis revealed a mysterious smile.",

    "content": "\"But what?\" Nian Bing asked doubtfully.\n\nGalimandis chuckled and said, \"But before they came, we had already communicated with Lord Dragon God. We told Lord Dragon God your thoughts, and after careful consideration by Lord Dragon God, we decided to help you. After all, we are brothers, not enemies. Moreover, everything you said is precisely what Lord Dragon God was worried about. Therefore, things went much smoother.\"\n\nNian Bing felt a warmth spread through him. The Dragon God and the Dragon Kings cared for him like elders. In the battle at that time, the Dragon Kings were indeed a force that could change the entire situation.\n\nGalimandis laughed heartily and said, \"Don't look at me with such grateful eyes. I won't fall for you. My sexual orientation is very normal.\"\n\nNian Bing's face stiffened. \"Go die.\" After saying these three words, the two of them couldn't help but burst into laughter as they met each other's gaze.\n\nGalimandis said, \"You know more or less what kind of people the Divine Race are. They are not only selfish but also extremely arrogant. Especially after arriving on the Yangguang Continent and not encountering any resistance, they all became like young cows with wings, soaring to the heavens. They unanimously demanded to be the vanguard from the Main Gods, saying that their strength alone was sufficient to solve the problem. Although we don't know what kind of power you possess, we understand your strength and that of Xilü, plus Feng Nu and the others, and the Bingyue Empire, which has a good relationship with you. You might not suffer losses, so naturally, we wouldn't stop them from doing something foolish and just let them go. As expected, that day they charged over aggressively, and we watched from afar, witnessing you, you brat, display your divine might and kill them without any way to resist. I've seen the God-Slaying Crossbow you designed; its power is not small. In a head-on confrontation, even we might not have a good outcome. Later, those two Main Gods, seeing that they couldn't take control of the situation, felt a bit embarrassed. They ordered us to attack. We had already discussed it with Feng Nu and the others beforehand. The moment we appeared, it was also the moment they appeared simultaneously. In the stalemate, a few Divine Race members were killed by Feng Nu and Chenchen, and we, in our stalemate, did not have the strength to defeat you, and we also delayed the time, forcing those two Main Gods to come out. In fact, we were already reluctant to act then. If you hadn't suddenly mutated, we would have officially rebelled against the Divine Continent.\"\n\nNian Bing naturally understood the meaning behind Galimandis's words. If the situation hadn't improved, the Seven Dragon Kings would have joined forces with his people to attack the two Main Gods. While they feared the Divine Race's future destruction of the Yangguang Continent, wasn't it also for themselves? Where else could he find such brothers?\n\nGalimandis laughed and said, \"You brat are becoming more monstrous now, much more monstrous than we imagined, even capable of instantly killing Main Gods. However, none of us figured out how you did it.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Naturally, it was the mental power in the Heavenly Eye acupoint. Big Brother, you must have heard of physical mental power attacks, right?\"\n\nGalimandis was surprised and said, \"You mean that golden light you unleashed at that time was mental power? No wonder. No wonder even Sang Shen's Imperial Acupoint couldn't withstand your attack. After all, those were the abilities of two domains!\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Mental power attacks have a great element of surprise. However, if that Main God had been prepared, I might not have been able to kill him so smoothly. The laughable thing is that that so-called unlucky god was so scared by my physical mental power attack that he even abandoned his Imperial Acupoint and only set up a barrier instead of attacking me. Otherwise, I would have been in trouble. A fourteenth-level Main God is indeed not that easy to deal with. Fortunately, only two came this time, and they cherished their lives so much. Big Brother, I fainted later, what happened? Was the seal of Muoda opened?\"\n\nGalimandis's expression turned solemn, and he nodded. \"The seal was successfully opened. From that day on, we don't know about other places, but the Bingyue Empire has been in a state of slight tremors. If I'm not mistaken, the Lost Continent has probably returned. We've been waiting for you to wake up, and we need to rush over to check immediately. Also, the little girl who cast the spell that day fainted after the spell ended, but Xie Yue surprised us today. His wife died saving their daughter. After seeing his wife die, he became a different person. At first, I didn't believe his transformation would be so sudden and thought he had some scheme. But later, he cut off his arm and gave it to Kajie, and only then did I realize that he had truly repented.\"\n\nNian Bing was surprised and said, \"Xie Yue repented? Who inherited the position of the ruler of the Lost Continent?\"\n\nGalimandis shrugged his shoulders and said, \"We don't know. Right now, none of us have a clear understanding of exactly what happened at that time, because only that little girl named Youyou could fully sense the changes when the seal was broken. Perhaps, only after she wakes up from her deep sleep can we get the answer. At least on the surface, it seems that no one has obtained the legendary position of ruler of the Lost Continent. Oh, right, do you know what Xie Yue put in the arm he gave to Kajie? That guy is truly sinister! Fortunately, his disposition changed at that time, otherwise, it's hard to predict what would have happened in the end.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred. He had already sensed that Xie Yue still had something hidden, but he could never figure out how strong his power was. Hearing Galimandis say this, he quickly asked, \"What exactly is it?\"\n\nGalimandis said solemnly, \"That thing is terrifying, and you probably haven't even heard of it. Even I'm seeing it for the first time. If Kajie Ossis didn't originally belong to the dark world, we probably wouldn't have been able to ascertain its origin. That guy Xie Yue destroyed his own arm and planted a special seed in his arm. This thing feeds on his vital blood every day, called the Demonic Seed. After thousands of years of cultivation, the Demonic Seed gradually grows into a strange plant. This plant itself has no offensive capabilities. However, in the process of its growth, it produces an extremely special venom. Except for not harming the owner who cultivates it, any other creature that touches it will die. You can understand it as corrosive venom, but the potency of this venom is something that nothing can resist. Anything.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred, and he asked, \"Magic and battle qi are also ineffective?\"\n\nGalimandis nodded solemnly and said, \"That's right, magic and battle qi are also ineffective. That thing can corrode anything, including energy. Once Xie Yue explodes his arm and releases that venom, within a certain range, where the venom passes, nothing can stop it. Even our dragon scales are ineffective. Moreover, the most sinister thing about this venom is that once it touches your body, you won't even have the chance to sever the limb. In just an instant, your body will completely disappear, and the venom will also disappear simultaneously. This venom, which is the epitome of yin and evil, is completely destructive.\"\n\nNian Bing gasped. He understood that with Xie Yue's strength, if he had exploded the venom at that time, perhaps no one present, except himself, would have survived. Cultivating such an evil thing over thousands of years at the cost of his own body was something only the ruler of the evil world could do.\n\nGalimandis chuckled and said, \"Therefore, this thing cannot even be stored. It's only safe in Xie Yue's arm. Now, Kajie is considering how to deal with Xie Yue's venomous hand. Alas, this thing is simply a hot potato. No matter where it's placed, it's hard to feel at ease. Unless it's used for destruction.\"\n\nA cold light flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. \"Xie Yue's thing was originally intended to deal with the Divine Race, so let's fulfill his wish. With the return of the Lost Continent, it becomes the bridge between the Divine Continent and the Yangguang Continent. That Main God escaped, and they probably won't give up easily. I think we should head to the Lost Continent sooner to see what the situation is like over there. Actually, I've always been a bit worried about the situation in the Lost Continent. If it has developed according to the Great War of the Gods ten thousand years ago, then ten thousand years later, their terror is probably no less than that of the Divine Continent. Now, I can only hope that the people of the Lost Continent will be more rational than those Divine Race members. Although the Lost Continent has returned, our plan can also be considered a failure.\" He referred to the failure as his inability to become the ruler of the Lost Continent. Now, the Lost Continent was essentially out of control.\n\nFeng Nu, who was standing nearby, suddenly said, \"That may not be the case. I think the legend of the Lost Continent might not be false. Perhaps, the true ruler of the Lost Continent has already appeared.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Feng Nu, and Feng Nu was also looking at him. Nian Bing's mind, which had become clear after waking from his coma, was working rapidly. He suddenly understood who Feng Nu was referring to and nodded. \"You're right. That girl who cast the spell is most likely to become the new ruler of the Lost Continent. However, she is Xie Yue's daughter. Xie Yue has repented, but she...\"\n\nFeng Nu sighed and said, \"You don't need to worry too much about this. When we brought her back, she had a companion named Ping Chao, a vampire count. Although Ping Chao is a vampire, the evil energy in him is not strong. We talked to him and learned about what happened between Xie Yue and his daughter. Xie Yue was truly sinister in the past. The spell he obtained required a virgin of extreme yin to complete. To complete the spell, he deliberately had a child with the Vampire Queen, Youyou. And not long ago, he forced his daughter to be a sacrifice to complete the spell. According to Ping Chao, although Youyou is a bit childish usually, she did not inherit her father's evil. So, after Youyou wakes up, I think we should have a good talk with her and hear her thoughts on the Lost Continent.\"\n\nNian Bing sighed and said, \"Another pitiable child. Although she has parents, it's better than having none.\" Hearing about Youyou's experience, he couldn't help but think of his own childhood, and his affection for Youyou grew. This was not the first time he had seen Youyou. He happened to arrive when Youyou and Maomao had a conflict. Although it was just a glance, with his memory, he still remembered Youyou's appearance.\n\nGalimandis said, \"Let's wait for three more days. If this girl Youyou still hasn't woken up, we'll have to take her with us to the edge of the Lost Continent. I don't know if our choice is correct, but the war between the Divine Continent and the Lost Continent is inevitable.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. He suddenly thought of something and quickly asked Feng Nu, \"Xilü Big Brother fainted from the shock that day. How is he now?\"\n\nFeng Nu smiled and said, \"Don't worry, Big Brother Xilü's armor has very strong defense. He's fine. He woke up before returning to Bingyue City, and his injuries have already recovered. Now, the only one not worried about problems with the Lost Continent is probably him. He's been extremely excited these past few days. If you hadn't been in a coma, I think he would have already rushed to the Lost Continent.\"\n\nNian Bing breathed a sigh of relief. \"Chenchen, please go to the palace and ask about the situation in the Yanfeng Mountain Range for me. I'll go see that girl Youyou now.\" As he spoke, he took out the token Yanfeng gave him from his spatial ring and handed it to Lan Chen.\n\nLan Chen nodded, turned, and left. Nian Bing stood up, stretched his body again, and, led by Feng Nu and Galimandis, walked towards the room where Youyou was staying.\n\nThe place where they were staying was a large inn. When they returned to Bingyue City, due to the special identity of the Seven Dragon Kings, and Nian Bing's subordinates being from the Blood Lion Cult, Bing Ling took charge and booked the entire inn to stay there temporarily. More than ten days had passed, and the slight tremors had disappeared. Bing Ling, worried about her son's safety, had not returned to the Ice God Tower. This time, she took people out, and amusingly, she left her husband, Nian Bing's father, Rong Tian, in the Ice God Tower to guard it with some junior disciples. One should know that Rong Tian was a fire mage!\n\nYouyou was residing in a shaded room, a request made by Ping Chao. People of darkness are very sensitive to sunlight. If they are exposed to sunlight for too long, it can cause significant harm to their bodies.\n\nWhen the three of them knocked on the door, the one who came out to open it was Maomao. As soon as Maomao saw that Nian Bing had woken up, she became as happy as a little bird and chirped incessantly, asking questions, making Nian Bing feel awkward. Feng Nu, on the other hand, had no intention of helping him, and watched with a smile as Maomao, who had grown into a young lady but still retained her childish temper, acted spoiled towards Nian Bing.\n\nIt's particularly busy at the end of the year. I'll try to update before 8 PM. Thank you for your support.",

    "content": "Garamandis rubbed Cat’s head and said, “Little girl, you’re quite something now, killing six divine beings at once, including a Rank 13 expert. This proves you’ve taken your father’s place as the continent’s number one Summoning Mage.”\n\nUpon hearing Garamandis mention her father, Cat’s smile faded considerably. She lowered her head and said, “Finally, I’ve avenged my father and mother. Those who killed them have all been killed by my little pets. I think Father would be very happy if he knew.”\n\nNian Bing put his arm around Cat’s shoulders and comforted her, “Be good, Cat, don’t be sad. Uncle Shilad hopes you’ll always be happy. Cheer up.”\n\nCat nodded gently and suddenly said, “Oh, right, Brother Nian Bing. Father is gone, and I’m the only one left of our White Race. According to the contract between us and the Dragon Clan, I can also choose one of the Seven Dragon Kings to be my contracted beast companion. I’ve already chosen.”\n\nNian Bing looked at her in surprise. Cat was already powerful enough, and the combined strength of her summoned beasts was terrifying, especially with the auxiliary magic from the fox companion. If she were to add a Dragon King, she might directly ascend to the ranks of Rank 14 powerhouses. “Who did Cat choose?”\n\nCat giggled and said, “I can’t choose Uncle Kagiosis, he’s the future Dragon God. And I can’t choose Aunt Dementina either, she can’t leave Uncle Kagiosis. I won’t choose Uncle Kadilis either, he’s helped our White Race a lot, and it’s time for him to rest. Aunt Sasaris is too cold, Cat is a little afraid of her. As for the fat guy, he looks like he eats a lot, and Cat is afraid he’ll eat me poor. Uncle Garamandis already has a wife, so I can’t choose him. I chose the one who’s left, naturally.”\n\nNian Bing chuckled and said, “Cat, I say, you call the Dragon Kings uncle, but I call them my elder brothers now. Isn’t this generational order a bit messy! Wow. What did you say? Did you choose that Space Dragon King Chaos, who likes to stir up trouble?” He looked at Cat in astonishment. After all, among the Seven Dragon Kings, Chaos was the weakest. This Space Dragon King’s strongest skill was only escape. The moment Nian Bing thought of how Chaos’s lecherousness seemed no less than that of the fox companion, he thought of those disgusting men who specifically seduces young girls.\n\nGaramandis looked at Nian Bing with a half-smile and said, “Brother, don’t think your precious little sister is at a disadvantage. In fact, Chaos is the one at a disadvantage. You haven’t seen how Chaos, that lazy fellow, has been tortured to death by Cat these past few days!”\n\nNian Bing looked at Garamandis in surprise, while Cat said a bit shyly, “Actually, I haven’t done anything. Uncle Chaos is very good to me! He does whatever I ask him to. Moreover, we were supposed to sign an equal contract, but accidentally, he seemed too excited at the time and mispronounced the spell, turning it into a master-servant contract, making him a pet similar to my little pets.”\n\nNian Bing’s eyes widened. “No way, Chaos makes a mistake like that?”\n\nIn reality, Chaos was too excited. When he heard that such a beautiful young girl like Cat had chosen him, he became a bit too overzealous. While chanting the spell, he didn’t pay much attention and accidentally turned the equal contract into a master-servant contract, making him Cat’s true pet, not a partner. Chaos had been depressed to death these past few days. With the master-servant contract, he had lost his freedom. As long as Cat was willing, she could make him do anything, and he had no ability to resist.\n\nGaramandis laughed and said, “Chaos deserves it. Who told him to get too excited? His mind is full of filth, and it’s time for him to suffer a bit. With the constraint of the master-servant contract, even if he becomes a member of the evil world, he cannot harm his master. You can rest assured this time. Let’s go, we’ll go in and see Youyou.”\n\nThe group went into the inner room. Ping Chao, who was sitting by the bed, quickly stood up. The tall figure appeared a little constrained, and his gaze towards Nian Bing was somewhat strange. Actually, it couldn’t be blamed on him. When he learned that Nian Bing had destroyed two God-Kings by himself, Nian Bing’s appearance naturally brought an invisible pressure to his psychology.\n\nNian Bing walked to Ping Chao’s side and looked at Youyou on the bed. Youyou lay there peacefully, her expression calm, her eyes closed, her long eyelashes, her face ruddy, and the slight rise and fall of her chest indicated that her life still existed. She looked very serene at this moment. The moment Nian Bing’s spiritual power scanned Youyou’s body through the Tianyan acupoint, he immediately felt a strange energy emanating from Youyou’s body, and his spiritual power could not penetrate it. This discovery couldn’t help but startle him.\n\n“How is she? Is there still no sign of her waking up?” Nian Bing asked Ping Chao.\n\nPing Chao sighed and said, “She’s been like this ever since that spell was completed. Occasionally, she mutters some words in her sleep, but we can’t hear what she’s saying. Your people have tried several times to wake her up with energy, but there seems to be an invisible energy within Youyou that prevents your people from channeling their energy into her body.”\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, “It seems she has to wake up on her own.”\n\nPing Chao seemed to want to say something, but didn’t. A hint of hesitation appeared in his eyes as he looked at Nian Bing. Nian Bing smiled slightly and said, “Say whatever you want to say. Everyone is here, and I don’t consider you enemies. Even Xie Yue can repent, let alone you? The evil aura on you is not strong, and you shouldn’t have done too many wicked things. I can see that you care about Youyou very much.”\n\nPing Chao nodded and said, “I watched Youyou grow up since she was little. In terms of seniority, she should have called me uncle. Or called me by my name directly, after all, I am the servant of Lord Evil Lord. But ever since Youyou could speak, she has only been willing to call me brother. I really miss the way she used to call me. This time, Youyou has suffered too much. Before the process of activating the seal, I could feel the despair in her heart. She was completely disappointed in her parents. Now, Madam Serna is dead, and Lord Evil Lord is also gone. I’m afraid, I’m afraid she won’t be able to bear it when she wakes up. Nian Bing, your name is Nian Bing, right? I hope, if Youyou wakes up, you will let us leave. Don’t worry, we will never do anything evil. Can we?”\n\nNian Bing looked at Ping Chao’s somewhat eager eyes and smiled slightly. “Why not? I have no right to restrict your freedom. However, I must clarify one thing beforehand. The Bottle of Meodas’s Seal has been opened under Youyou’s spell, and the Lost Continent should have returned to this world. I hope that after Youyou wakes up, you can persuade her to tell us about what happened then. The Lost Continent, for us on the Radiant Continent, we don’t know if it’s a blessing or a curse. We must be prepared. Then, you can leave. None of us will stop you.”\n\nPing Chao thought for a moment and said, “I can’t promise you that. If Youyou is unwilling to say, how can I force her? I can only say that I will try my best to persuade her. We are different. You belong to righteousness, and we are evil,……”\n\nNian Bing interrupted Ping Chao’s words, “What is righteousness? What is evil? Under certain conditions, righteousness and evil can be transformed. I have never looked down on you. I hope you can also value yourself. Xie Yue is gone, and you have no intention of continuing his evil business. Under this premise, I think we can become friends.”\n\nPing Chao looked at Nian Bing in surprise. Nian Bing smiled back at him. He saw sincerity in Ping Chao’s smile, sincerity unmixed with any impurities. He sighed, “Perhaps, Youyou is right. I shouldn’t have belonged to the dark world. Thank you, friend. You have calmed my heart a lot.” As he spoke, he extended his hand towards Nian Bing. But when he saw the jet-black nails on his hand, he subconsciously withdrew it. But at this moment, Nian Bing’s strong hand had already grasped his hand, which had no warmth. “Believe me, we will become friends. Let’s wait for Youyou to wake up together. Everything is over. For you, a brand new beginning awaits. You and Youyou will be reborn, won’t you?”\n\nPing Chao smiled. This was the first time he had smiled since coming here. “Thank you. As long as Youyou can wake up, it will be the greatest gift from heaven to me. Yes! We are reborn, no longer belonging to anyone, only to ourselves.”\n\nNian Bing looked at Ping Chao’s smile, knowing that he must have resolved a knot in his heart. When Ping Chao looked at Youyou, he saw a gaze similar to his own, the kind of gaze that only appeared when he looked at his wife.\n\nNian Bing took a step forward and sat down by Youyou’s bed. Cat came over and whispered to him, “Brother Nian Bing, you have to find a way to save her! Let her wake up quickly.”\n\nNian Bing looked at Cat and smiled, “I remember you fought each other back then. Don’t you hate her?”\n\nCat shook her head and said, “I only hate the murderers who killed our people. Youyou is so pitiful! Like Cat, she has no father or mother. How can I hate her? I just hope she can wake up soon.”\n\nCat’s kindness touched everyone present. Nian Bing took Youyou’s hand and held her wrist. He did not inject his innate energy or his magic elements. He slowly closed his eyes, and a soft green light gradually lit up on his chest.\n\nEveryone in the room, including Ping Chao, could clearly feel an exceptionally comfortable sensation, like a warm spring breeze caressing their bodies. That warm, comforting feeling instantly spread throughout their bodies, and their bodies underwent changes to varying degrees. Ping Chao felt it the most deeply because he hadn’t had blood for many days and was actually very weak. However, in this life-filled aura, his discomfort instantly disappeared. It was a peculiar feeling, and everything around him seemed so beautiful.\n\nThe soft green light enveloped Nian Bing’s body. Nian Bing did not directly infuse it into Youyou’s body. Instead, he controlled the green airflow to circle Youyou’s body and carefully seeped into her body from her skin. Regardless of what elemental energy one cultivated, as long as they were living beings, life aura was extremely important to them. Only the undead would fear this purest life energy.\n\nJust as everyone in the room was feeling the life-filled aura, Youyou’s body suddenly trembled. The hand that Nian Bing was holding suddenly grabbed Nian Bing’s wrist, and her long fingernails pierced Nian Bing’s skin. Fortunately, Nian Bing’s skin was extremely tough, only denting without breaking.\n\n“Ah! Brother Ping Chao, Mother, Mother, don’t die…” With a startled cry, Youyou suddenly sat up, her eyes filled with fear, and a fine layer of sweat covered her forehead in an instant.\n\nPing Chao quickly stepped forward, suppressing the excitement in his heart, and took Youyou’s hand from Nian Bing, saying softly, “Youyou, Brother Ping Chao is here, I’m here! How are you? Are you feeling better?”\n\nYouyou’s chest heaved rapidly. The dullness in her eyes gradually regained some clarity. She looked at Ping Chao beside her, then at Nian Bing and the others in front of the bed, her consciousness quickly recovering.\n\nGaramandis was about to say something but was stopped by Nian Bing. Nian Bing whispered, “She just woke up. Let her rest for a while. We’ll go back first.” Youyou’s mental state was not good. Moreover, Nian Bing hoped that Ping Chao could persuade her to tell him what happened then. It wasn’t time to be hasty.\n\nGaramandis nodded. As he and Feng Nu and Cat were about to retreat, they heard Youyou’s cold voice, “Don’t go, I have something to say.”\n\nNian Bing turned back to look at Youyou. He saw that her eyes had calmed down. She tightly held Ping Chao’s large hand and looked at Nian Bing and the others, “Where is my father? Did you kill him?”\n\nNian Bing countered, “If I told you that Xie Yue has been killed by us, what would you do?”\n\nA smile appeared on Youyou’s face, and she gave an incredible answer, “I would be very happy. He shouldn’t have existed in this world in the first place.”",

    "content": "Nian Bing's whole body trembled, and he said, \"Do you hate him that much?\"\n\nYou You said faintly, \"I've repaid what I owed him. He gave me life, and I used my life to help him once. We are no longer indebted to each other. I have no relationship with him anymore. If there is anything, it is only hatred. Mother died protecting me. If it weren't for him, Mother wouldn't have died. It was only at that moment that I knew Mother loved me.\"\n\nNian Bing sighed and said, \"It seems your memory was only preserved until the time of your mother's death. You said you had something to say, what did you want to tell us?\"\n\nYou You's agitated emotions gradually calmed down, and she said faintly, \"You are cooperating with my father, presumably for the Lost Continent. Regardless of your purpose, I believe you are very eager to know the situation on the Lost Continent. And the true situation is probably something only I understand. I will tell you now.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" Galmanthis suddenly stopped You You from speaking. Looking at You You's somewhat complex gaze, he said, \"Girl, before you speak, let me tell you what happened after you fainted. Perhaps it will be beneficial to you.\" He then recounted in detail what Xie Yue had said before leaving and how he had handed the arm with the demon seed to Kadiosys.\n\nWhen Galmanthis reached the words Xie Yue had entrusted him with before leaving, You You's expression underwent subtle changes, a touch of sadness creeping into her cold demeanor.\n\n\"He said that? He would give up the thing he wanted most?\" You You's eyes were filled with confusion.\n\nGalmanthis said, \"I was unwilling to believe your father either, but everything I have said is indeed the truth, and it cannot be changed.\"\n\nYou You said calmly, \"So what? He's already done it. There are no miracle cures in the world. Can he bring my mother back to life?\"\n\nPing Chao tightly held You You's hand and whispered, \"You You, don't be like this. I think Lord Xie will have figured it out.\"\n\nYou You shook her head and said, \"Whether he has figured it out or not is irrelevant to me. From the moment I began to chant the first incantation, I was no longer his daughter. Now, I am an orphan with no parents. Brother Ping Xiang, do you still want me?\"\n\n\"Yes. Of course, I do. Unless I die, I will forever and ever protect you by your side.\" Ping Chao excitedly held You You, as if wanting to warm You You's cold aura with his heart.\n\nYou You's spirit lifted slightly, and she gently broke free from Ping Chao's embrace. She looked at Nian Bing, \"Perhaps you are wondering why I am willingly telling you what I know. It's quite simple. I need your help.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Go ahead, I think I understand what you mean.\"\n\nYou You sat up from the bed and looked directly at Nian Bing. \"The Lost Continent has returned. After the incantation ended, the seal was easily broken. I am also puzzled as to how the Divine Continent used such immense energy to send it away. How could it return just by breaking a seal? But now I know. Because during the time after the incantation ended, I was not truly unconscious but was receiving information from the Lost Continent. I don't know where that information came from, but I saw the changes of the Lost Continent over the past ten thousand years and the scene when it left our world ten thousand years ago.\"\n\nEveryone's attention was focused. No one interrupted You You; they quietly listened to her narration.\n\n\"Ten thousand years ago, the Divine Continent somehow gathered such immense energy that it opened the Gate of Time and forcibly removed the entire Lost Continent from our world. However, the energy required for the spatial transfer of a continent is too vast. Therefore, the people of the Divine Continent could only seal the Gate of Time at the moment the Lost Continent was sent away, leaving the Lost Continent suspended in another world. However, it has always been lingering outside the time tunnel, lingering outside the seal. After all, it belongs to our world and has always had a connection with our world, like a tenacious rope that has been pulling the Lost Continent. It was only because of the seal that it could not be pulled back. And the Moordas Seal Bottle is the key to opening this seal. Perhaps you don't believe me, but now, there is not a drop of blood left in my body. To open the Moordas Seal Bottle, one needs all of my vital essence.\"\n\nNian Bing exclaimed in surprise, \"Was that the red light sphere that formed in front of you at that time?\"\n\nYou You nodded and said, \"Yes, it was that light sphere. However, I did not die. My blood became a sacrifice, but my body received the energy that returned when the seal broke. Now, that energy is my blood. It can be said that in that incantation, I went through a process of rebirth. And after the seal was finally opened, nothing could stop the Lost Continent from returning, so it came back. Under an invisible pull, it returned to our world. I used to hear Xie Yue talk about the War of the Gods and the Lost Continent. If you are now worried that while the Lost Continent's return can resist the Divine Continent, it will also bring trouble to the Yangguang Continent, then you are all mistaken.\"\n\nNian Bing anxiously asked, \"Why? Does the Lost Continent...\"\n\nYou You said, \"That's right, the current Lost Continent is no longer the Lost Continent of the past. Ten thousand years ago, the Lost Continent was a beautiful place. At that time, all sorts of strange creatures grew on the Lost Continent. The prosperity of that scene could not be changed even by the current Yangguang Continent. However, the War of the Gods and the Lost Continent disrupted the ecological balance of the entire Lost Continent. When the Lost Continent was sent to another world, it lost its ties to our world. The remaining plants withered, the rivers dried up, and everything moved from beauty to ugliness. When my incantation was completed, scenes kept flashing before my eyes, and I am sure that is what has happened to the Lost Continent over the past ten thousand years. Ten thousand years have passed, and the changes in the Lost Continent are shocking. The once prosperous continent has become extremely barren. Even a drop of water can become a treasure on the Lost Continent. In the past ten thousand years, the population of the Lost Continent has not only not increased but has been constantly decreasing. Only the most resilient races and humans could survive. In the past ten thousand years, the Lost Continent has not only failed to develop into a power that can contend with the Divine Continent, but it has been continuously declining, and its civilization is gradually disappearing. Now, there is not even a single city on the Lost Continent. Only at the last water source do a few creatures survive. They have returned now, and the harsh environment has changed. However, it is unknown how long it will take to recover its vitality.\"\n\nSilence. The room fell into silence. Nian Bing's mind raced. Through the monitoring of his Heavenly Eye acupoint, he knew that everything You You said was from the bottom of her heart and there were no lies. He had imagined many scenarios for the return of the Lost Continent. He had also considered the possibility of its decline, but from the news he received from You You, the Lost Continent was more than just declining. If a little more time passed and the last water source there also disappeared, the Lost Continent might become a dead continent.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Nian Bing managed to calm his turbulent emotions and looked at You You. \"So, you hope we can help the Lost Continent. Is that right?\"\n\nYou You smiled. Her smile was somewhat desolate. \"Xie Yue exhausted all his efforts to become the Lord of the Lost Continent. I'm afraid he never imagined that this returning Lost Continent would only have tens of thousands of survivors left, and even survival would be a problem. How ridiculous. It's truly ridiculous!\"\n\nNian Bing sighed and said, \"It's not just your father who is ridiculous. Didn't we also think that the return of the Lost Continent would bring a period of peace to the Yangguang Continent, and that we could move the battlefield with the gods there? But what we welcomed back is the bridge between the Divine Continent and the Yangguang Continent. Even ordinary gods could easily come to the Yangguang Continent. If I'm not mistaken, you, who have given all your vital essence for the return of the Lost Continent, have now become the true ruler of the Lost Continent.\"\n\nYou You laughed self-mockingly. \"Yes, you are very smart. When those scenes ended, I heard a voice, and that voice said, 'Welcome, our Goddess.' God, I hate this word, but I have become the goddess of those tens of thousands of survivors. The last scene was my figure turning into an illusion and appearing before the remaining races of the Lost Continent. I saw their eyes full of hope and their devout gazes. Can you tell me what I should do now? In this situation, what reason do I have to hide anything?\"\n\nNian Bing said with a wry smile, \"Now, I also really want to know what to do. However, the only thing I can think of now is that we need to find a way to deal with the revenge of the gods first.\"\n\nGalmanthis said, \"Nian Bing, you don't need to worry too much. Although the gods are deeply wary of the Lost Continent, they are always very cautious. Now that the Lost Continent has returned, they will not act rashly without complete preparation. Although our strength is not enough to contend with them, with us dragons and you, we are not so easily destroyed. Moreover, according to what You You said, only the strong who can adapt to the environment can survive on the Lost Continent. Perhaps some powerful individuals among them are superior. If all else fails, we still have the Yangguang Continent as our backup. The Yangguang Continent has four great empires and a population of tens of millions, with a large amount of usable resources. As long as they are allocated reasonably, they will surely pose a threat to the gods. The number of gods is less than ten thousand, and the truly powerful ones are only about a hundred. This time, they came to the Yangguang Continent and lost one main god and more than ten god-level and demigod-level experts. They suffered heavy losses.\"\n\nNian Bing sighed and said, \"We can only take it one step at a time. I hope the gods prepare for a longer period, and it will give us time to prepare properly to face their arrival. Miss You You, you should know the location of the survivors of the Lost Continent. Rest for a few more days, and when your body has fully recovered, we will set off.\"\n\nYou You said somewhat helplessly, \"There's no need to rest. I'm fine now and can leave anytime. I never thought about what I could do before. I just wanted to live with Brother Ping Chao. But now, whenever I think of the hopeful gazes in the eyes of those people from the Lost Continent, I feel a lot of responsibility. Thank you for being willing to help me.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"There's nothing to thank for. We are just protecting this pure land, the Yangguang Continent. The Lost Continent is the stepping stone from the Divine Continent to the Yangguang Continent. Once those gods discover the true situation of the Lost Continent, and after those survivors of the Lost Continent are killed by them, the next ones will be the Yangguang Continent. Therefore, we are only protecting ourselves.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"No, you should still rest for a few days. I think although your vital essence has turned into energy, it does not mean you are an energy body. The energy within you is strange, complementing your original dark abilities and maintaining your life. Just now, I used your life aura to stimulate your body's functions. I think in a few days, your vital essence will recover. At that time, as long as you carefully perceive your own energy, your strength will surely increase by a significant level. For us, every bit of strength we gain now will give us a greater chance of opposing the Divine Continent. Moreover, I also need to handle some matters these few days. Since the Lost Continent has returned, I think many people will be interested in it.\"\n\nYou You was stunned for a moment. She saw a wise glint in Nian Bing's eyes. Nian Bing thought far ahead. The Dragon God had told him back then that the area of the Lost Continent was even larger than the Yangguang Continent. Although the Lost Continent was no longer the Lost Continent of the past, it was because it lacked various necessities for survival in another dimension. But now that it had returned, it was an opportunity for the four great empires of the Yangguang Continent. With this opportunity, if utilized well, it could make the four great empires contribute to helping them cope with the arrival of the Divine Continent. After all, they also had a responsibility to protect the Yangguang Continent.\n\nAfter leaving You You's room, Nian Bing returned to his own room, got paper and brush, and immediately wrote three letters. As soon as the letters were finished, he had Yin Dang send them out. The three letters were for Prince Rong of the Huaron Empire, Luo Rou of the Oran Empire, and Mu Jing of the Langmu Empire. By the time he finished writing the letters, Lan Chen had also returned.",

    "content": "\"How is it? Chenchen, are there any signs from the Tiandang Mountain Range?\" Nian Bing asked.\n\nLan Chen replied, \"Two days ago, Commander Xue Po sent someone with a letter back, stating that there was a great tremor in the Tiandang Mountain Range, and many high mountains collapsed. Fortunately, their encampment was on the outskirts, so they were not affected. The tremors were still ongoing when the letter arrived.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"The return of the Lost Continent has had a significant impact on our world. I will go see Yan Feng now. It's time to talk with him. Although the Bingyue and Aolan Empires are weaker among the Four Empires, they are indeed closest to the Tiandang Mountain Range, and they have now formed an alliance with the Langmu Empire. If we can accomplish some things before the Huaron Empire arrives, I believe it will greatly benefit the distribution of the Lost Continent in the future, as the Huaron Empire is too far from the Lost Continent.\"\n\nLan Chen's heart stirred and he said, \"I've already heard about the situation on the Lost Continent from Sister. Bing, are you suggesting that we should have the Four Empires on the Yangguang Continent occupy the Lost Continent?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"The Lost Continent is lacking many things now, like a wasteland. What it needs most is reclamation. Such a vast piece of land will sooner or later attract the attention of the Four Empires. And according to Youyou, there are only tens of thousands of inhabitants on the Lost Continent. With such a large continent, why can't it be divided among the Four Empires? It seems that this time, the Four Empires will truly move towards balance. Now, we can only use this to get the Four Empires to send troops to the Lost Continent. The Lost Continent is currently most in need of water. However, as soon as it returned, like the Yangguang Continent, it faces the sea on at least three sides. I think, with the increase in rainfall, if we can gather some water and ice mages, near the coast, we can use the water element to create some artificial lakes. This way, it will not be difficult for the Lost Continent to gradually develop.\"\n\nLan Chen was somewhat confused and said, \"Nian Bing, shouldn't our most important task now be to deal with those gods? The development of the Lost Continent is not something we should be concerned about!\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"For the Four Empires, the Lost Continent is extremely important. If the Lost Continent is not suitable for survival, then their motivation will decrease. When the gods from the Divine Continent attack, we will have to face them alone. But if the Four Empires all find the Lost Continent to be very fertile land, with the size of the Lost Continent, what do you think they will do? I believe they will definitely send heavy troops to try to occupy a part of it for reclamation. Although we don't know the situation on the Lost Continent yet, such a large piece of land, I don't believe the Four Empires will not be tempted. Although the gods are powerful, there are only a little over a hundred truly strong individuals among them. The rest are mostly at the eleventh level, or even less than the eleventh level. If we can concentrate all the elite forces of the Yangguang Continent, we may not be unable to fight them. Therefore, what we need to do now is very simple: to ignite the ambitions of the Four Empires and then cleverly utilize them.\"\n\nLan Chen suddenly realized and said, \"I understand what you mean. It shouldn't be a problem for you to use the Bingyue Empire. When Yan Feng mentions you, he absolutely praises you. Moreover, now that Mother controls the Ice God Tower, the entire Bingyue Empire is practically under your control. As for the other three empires, you have some connections with them. To effectively use the Four Empires, you are the key.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Your analysis is very accurate. I am the key now. For me, the most important thing is to use them reasonably. Alright, you go and rest for a while. You must be tired from taking care of me these days. I need to go and discuss with Yan Feng properly. After all, the Bingyue Empire is our foundation. This time, we must let the Bingyue Empire gain more benefits.\" In his heart, he had already made his plans. Among the Four Empires, the one he needed to worry about the least was the Huaron Empire. The Huaron Empire was already powerful enough, far surpassing the other three empires. The Bingyue and Aolan Empires were relatively weaker, but the Tiandang Mountain Range was within the territory of the Aolan Empire. As long as they coordinated well and quickly occupied the large area of land on the other side of the Tiandang Mountain Range, the development of both empires would be much better in the future. As for what the Langmu Empire would gain, it would depend on the influence of Mu Jing on the Langmu Empire and the importance the Langmu Empire attached to the Lost Continent.\n\nThree days later, Nian Bing, leading a contingent of thirty thousand people, set off on the road to the Tiandang Mountain Range. Among these thirty thousand people, besides the six hundred elites from the Blood Lion Sect and strong individuals like Nian Bing, the rest were various talents brought together by Nian Bing and Yan Feng after discussions. This included one hundred ice mages Nian Bing had mobilized from the Ice God Tower, and a magic legion composed of five hundred mages of various elements, personally led by Long Zhi, the president of the Bingyue Empire Mages Guild and the father of Long Ling. The remaining people had no combat power. Thirty thousand people, carrying thirty large carts of supplies, set off grandly towards the Tiandang Mountain Range. The Bingyue Empire no longer needed to send troops; the elites previously led by Marshal Xue Po were sufficient to handle any situation. The Bingyue Empire's greatest advantage was its distance from the Huaron Empire, and its neighbors were allies, so there was no need to consider defense. This time, Yan Feng was determined to cooperate fully with Nian Bing. These three thousand carts of supplies were only the first batch. As Nian Bing departed, Yan Feng had already mobilized the entire country, and without affecting the nation's production in various aspects, he was mobilizing as many resources and craftsmen as possible. When Nian Bing explained the situation of the Lost Continent to Yan Feng in detail, Yan Feng had a premonition that this was his chance to become the most enlightened monarch in the history of the Bingyue Empire. And it was precisely because of Nian Bing's help, and his position as the highest decision-maker of the Bingyue Empire, that the Bingyue Empire had the possibility of seizing the initiative. When he discussed with his ministers, the plan he and Nian Bing had formulated was unanimously approved. Therefore, the full mobilization of the country encountered no resistance and was proceeding vigorously. Even Nian Bing did not expect Yan Feng to give him such unreserved support, which made him even more confident this time.\n\nAs Nian Bing led his people out of Bingyue City and marched towards the Tiandang Mountain Range, the three letters he sent out also caused huge ripples in the other three empires. Among them, the Aolan Empire reacted the fastest. With the development of the Aolan Empire in recent years, Luo Rou's influence in the Aolan Empire had grown day by day. The King of Aolan Empire, seeing his country becoming stronger day by day, placed even greater trust in Luo Rou, not to mention that Luo Rou also had the support of Duke Lan Yu, the foremost figure in the Aolan military and the father of Lan Chen and Feng Nu. After several days of careful consideration, the Aolan Empire also made its choice. Apart from the fifty thousand elites already sent to the Tiandang Mountain Range, the entire army was mobilized and dispatched to the border with the Huaron Empire, that is, the original border with the Qilu Empire. Luo Rou herself, as stated in the letter of credit, mobilized a large number of resources in the shortest possible time and set off towards the Tiandang Mountain Range. Although the Tiandang Mountain Range was within the Aolan Empire's territory, the distance from Bingyue City in the Bingyue Empire to the Tiandang Mountain Range was not much different from the distance from the Aolan Empire to the Tiandang Mountain Range. When Luo Rou set off with her people, Nian Bing had already been on the road for more than half a month with the elites of the Bingyue Empire.\n\nAt this time, fierce debates were still ongoing in the Langmu Empire and the Huaron Empire. Mu Jing held a high position in the Langmu Empire. Due to the influence of the Earth Goddess's domain, she was a target of various factions, and she was also deeply trusted by the King of the Langmu Empire. Unfortunately, she was only a young girl. When she reported this matter to the King of the Langmu Empire, it caused an uproar in the country.\n\nThose who supported Mu Jing were a faction led by her brother, Mu Rong. Those who opposed were the conservative faction of the Langmu Empire. Their reason for opposition was simple: they suggested sending people to investigate the Lost Continent first before drawing conclusions about whether it truly existed, as the Langmu Empire had already allied with the Aolan Empire, and it wouldn't be difficult to send people there. However, Mu Jing's opinion was very firm, hoping that the Langmu Empire would immediately dispatch heavy troops to escort supplies to the Lost Continent for reclamation. She firmly believed that Nian Bing would not speak without reason. Since the Lost Continent existed, the opportunity should not be missed; first come, first served, a principle she understood very well. Unfortunately, the King still sided with the conservative faction, believing that there was a threat from the Huaron Empire to the south. Although a peace treaty had been signed, they had to guard against it. Therefore, it was still better to send people to gather information.\n\nA month later, the Langmu Empire received news from two fronts. One was from the Aolan Empire, stating that the Aolan Empire's army had been stationed outside the border with the Huaron Empire and requested resource support from the Langmu Empire. The other was a report from a scout. Although the scout could not reach the Lost Continent, he discovered a large number of troops and supply vehicles in the Tiandang Mountain Range, all belonging to the Bingyue Empire and the Aolan Empire. It was only then that the King of the Langmu Empire felt something was amiss. After discussing with Mu Jing, he decided to dispatch troops as well. Before this, he not only mobilized his own troops to guard the Tiandang Mountain Range but also sent a large amount of resources to the Aolan Empire. After all, to defend this long and narrow front line, the cooperation of the Aolan Empire was essential. The Aolan Empire naturally did not stop the actions of the Langmu Empire. The vast amount of resources alone gave them no reason to refuse passage through their territory to the Tiandang Mountain Range for the Langmu Empire. However, when the Langmu Empire's army was dispatched, Luo Rou had already been in the Tiandang Mountain Range for a month, and the third batch of supplies from the Bingyue Empire had already passed through the Tiandang Mountain Range.\n\nThe Huaron Empire was already very far from the Bingyue Empire and naturally received the news last. Prince Rong's status in the Huaron Empire was naturally incomparable to that of Mu Jing. He also deeply believed that what his grandson said was true. However, the Huaron Empire faced its own difficulties. When they received the news and after discussions between Prince Rong, Prime Minister Su Yue, and Emperor Huatian, it was decided that the Huaron Empire also wanted to get a piece of the pie from the Lost Continent. By then, the army of the Aolan Empire had already arrived at the border to garrison, clearly intending to prevent the Huaron Empire from going to the Lost Continent. The army of the Langmu Empire also arrived soon. Due to the Qilu Empire, although the Huaron Empire was confident in its strength, it was not easy to break through the blockade line of the two empires. Moreover, the peace treaty had just been signed not long ago, so they were naturally unwilling to provoke the three countries with such a grave act. After careful deliberation, the Huaron Empire decided to take another route, which was the sea route. Although they could not reach it from the Yangguang Continent, they could reach it by sea. Within two months, the Huaron Empire mobilized all its own ships and all the ships of the former Qilu Empire, leading its most elite troops and a large number of supply materials, becoming the last to head towards the Lost Continent.\n\nAlthough Nian Bing's three letters played a crucial role, the slight earthquake that occurred throughout the Yangguang Continent before his letters arrived became the basis for the three countries to believe him. For a time, all Four Empires of the Yangguang Continent mobilized and marched towards the Lost Continent. What they brought were not only troops but also a large amount of supplies and craftsmen from various fields.\n\nNian Bing and his group had been on the Lost Continent for three months. Originally, it was very difficult to transport resources over the steep mountains, but Nian Bing and his group were not ordinary people. Due to the impact of the earthquake, many places in the Tiandang Mountain Range had already collapsed. Nian Bing, Feng Nu, Lan Chen, Xi Lu, and the Seven Dragon Kings joined forces and, in just two days, used the collapsed sections of the Tiandang Mountain Range to carve out a flat avenue. Although it was only a little over ten zhang wide, it was already sufficient for the troops transporting resources to pass through.\n\nAs soon as they arrived on this continent, they were stunned by everything before their eyes. Just as Youyou had said, the Lost Continent was a desolate land. As far as the eye could see, not a single plant could be seen. The place where the Lost Continent connected with the Yangguang Continent was only the area of the Tiandang Mountain Range. On both sides of the Tiandang Mountain Range, all that could be seen was a vast ocean. Upon arriving on the Lost Continent, Nian Bing ordered all six hundred mages to stay on a plain by the sea and begin the construction of artificial lakes. Xi Lu was a master blacksmith, and his destructive power was also at a master level. For ordinary people, reclaiming a lake was an extremely difficult task, but for him, using the God-Slaying Axe as a foundation, it only took a few attacks. This was even with him deliberately controlling it, seeking only area and not depth. In just a few days, a huge pit appeared under his powerful strength, and at this time, the water and ice mages became crucial.",

    "content": "The magicians of the Ice God Tower, led by Lan Chen, with Long Ling assisting her father, took advantage of the abundant water element near the ocean. Over the course of a month, they had already excavated a massive freshwater lake on the Lost Continent. Meanwhile, craftsmen from the Ice Moon Empire were constantly busy, utilizing various materials and resources. They established the first city on the Lost Continent in ten thousand years next to this artificial lake, which was named Ice Moon Lake. Under the protection of the garrison, they began to sow seeds by the lake, planting various crops suitable for growth. Although the Lost Continent was barren, exploration revealed the land to be fertile and ideal for agriculture. The army had transformed into laborers, carving out rivers from the lake to extend outwards.\n\nThe magicians continuously summoned heavy rains using the water element, nourishing the land. After three months of unceasing effort, the area around Ice Moon Lake began to show signs of prosperity. The most crucial element was Nian Bing. He infused the lake water with his life essence. While he couldn't make all plants grow instantly like Kao, the lake water, enriched with life energy, greatly accelerated the growth of all crops, turning the shores of Ice Moon Lake a vibrant green. When the main forces of the Oulan Empire and the Langmu Empire arrived, Ice Moon Lake had already taken shape. Luo Rou fully utilized her intelligence, with the Ice Moon Empire occupying a plain in the northwest and her forces taking another plain in the southeast. After passing through the Tiandang Mountain Range, they each claimed the two plains closest to the Yangguang Continent. However, the Oulan Empire had significantly fewer magicians than the Ice Moon Empire, so their artificial lake was still under construction and would take some time to complete. Nevertheless, Nian Bing couldn't match Luo Rou's resource allocation. The Oulan Empire had not dispatched troops, but the synergy of various talents accelerated their construction. When Mu Jing arrived with the Langmu Empire's army, they could only extend inland with resignation. At this point, she was unwilling to offend Nian Bing and Luo Rou. After negotiations with Nian Bing, she established the Langmu Empire's temporary base near Ice Moon Lake, drawing a river from it for freshwater supply. Naturally, the benefits weren't free; Mu Jing's nature magicians also needed to assist the Ice Moon Empire with various crop planting, as, in terms of cultivation, even the Huarong Empire couldn't compare to the Langmu Empire.\n\nThree months passed, and the three empires were all busy. Nian Bing was also not idle. Utilizing resource allocation and his own continuous efforts, all two hundred God-Slaying Crossbows were equipped with twenty God-Slaying Arrows. The elites of the Blood Lion Cult also arrived successively under his command, with the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion personally coming to the Lost Continent, totaling two thousand people, becoming Nian Bing's strongest support. The arrival of the Seven Elders of the Blood Lion also informed Nian Bing of the Huarong Empire's entry into the Lost Continent via waterways. Nian Bing was not surprised; it would have been abnormal if the Huarong Empire hadn't taken action.\n\nUpon arriving at the Lost Continent, Nian Bing initially intended to search for the lost continent's inhabitants with Youyou immediately. However, he later realized a problem and abandoned his initial plan, choosing to focus on development on the Lost Continent first. The greatest advantage of being close to the Yangguang Continent was the continuous supply of resources. Magicians and the army cooperated, constantly extending Ice Moon Lake inland. Through rivers and terrain, they constructed lake after lake inland, along with crop cultivation, developing rapidly. The construction of Yuehu City by the shores of Ice Moon Lake had also begun. Rocks could be sourced locally, and the craftsmen were the finest. In about half a year, the city would be completed. After these preparations, just as Nian Bing was about to proceed with his next move, an unwelcome group arrived.\n\nIn the early morning, warm sunlight bathed the land. The azure waters of Ice Moon Lake shimmered with rippling light under the gentle breeze, a faint mist diffusing over the surface. The vibrant green patches along the lakeshore were full of life. Nourished by nature magic and life-infused water sources, plants grew at an incredibly fast rate. The people of the three empires only needed seeds; after planting, a scene of prosperity unfolded. Youyou stood by the lake, gazing at the clear water. Her sorrow had significantly faded compared to three months prior. Her current wish was to see the entire Lost Continent covered in green. When one has a goal, life is no longer monotonous.\n\nPing Chao stood beside Youyou, looking at the smiling girl, a warm current flowing through his heart. The happy Youyou was back. Indeed, this place was so beautiful.\n\nJust then, Youyou's expression suddenly changed. Her gaze swept towards the distance, where a large cloud of dust was rising. The dust formed a cohesive, unbroken mass. Ping Chao and Youyou's faces changed simultaneously. They both thought of the same problem: could it be the gods arriving?\n\nNian Bing emerged from his tent. The army, which had just begun its morning work, also ceased its tasks, quickly forming an array to face the enemy. Led by Marshal Xue Po and Mu Jing, they took formation by the shores of Ice Moon Lake. In the distance, they could see that before the large dust cloud, there was a sea of fiery red – a fiery red army. All of them were cavalry. Seeing this unit, Youyou, who was floating in the air, breathed a sigh of relief. After all, they were humans, not those gods. Just as Nian Bing had said, after the process of unsealing the last time, Youyou's strength had greatly increased, and her control over darkness had reached a new level. Looking out, although the army was in neat formation, they were mounted on horses. Judging by their aura and the horses, they were clearly not from the God Continent.\n\nAt this moment, Xue Po and Mu Jing's expressions turned grim, as they both recognized this cavalry, resembling a red cloud, as the Flame Lion Knights, once known as the continent's foremost knightly order. The Huarong Empire had indeed come, and they appeared ready to attack at any moment. When the Flame Lion Knights stopped about five miles in front of the Ice Moon and Langmu armies, they parted as if split by a giant blade. With the earth trembling, colossal earth dragons emerged. The true foremost knightly order of the continent, the Flame Earth Dragon Knights, appeared from behind the Flame Lion Knights. Seated alone on the back of a massive earth dragon, wearing a shimmering red magic robe embroidered with a golden lion, was Rong Yan, the Prince Rong, who held the supreme military authority of the Huarong Empire and was as renowned as the Ice Goddess Priestess.\n\nXue Po, mounted on his horse, was deeply shocked by the scene, even though it was his first time seeing these two famous knightly orders. Having spent his life in the military, he felt nothing but astonishment and envy seeing such a powerful knightly order. How he wished his own subordinates could have such a formidable knightly order.\n\nAlthough the Ice Moon Empire had dispatched fifty thousand troops this time, the Oulan Empire's army had not followed, instead remaining stationed in the Tiandang Mountain Range, responsible for assisting the supply convoys of the three kingdoms through the mountains. The Langmu Empire also sent fifty thousand troops, but to conserve resources for land development, they had sent mostly infantry with only a small contingent of cavalry. Despite a total of one hundred thousand troops, Xue Po felt no confidence facing the Huarong Empire's two knightly orders. The several thousand Flame Earth Dragon Knights alone could shatter their defensive line with a single charge.\n\nJust then, seven loud dragon roars echoed from the rear. Xue Po blinked and couldn't help but look back. He saw seven increasingly large beams of light – blue, red, cyan, yellow, silver, white, and black. The seven-colored lights expanded as they shifted. When they appeared in mid-air, colossal dragon forms were revealed – dragons, legendary great dragons, and seven-headed great dragons.\n\nThe dragon roars grew louder and higher. The earth dragons of the previously menacing Flame Earth Dragon Knights showed fear in their enormous dragon eyes, retreating uncontrollably. All the warhorses present, regardless of which side they belonged to, collapsed to the ground, trembling uncontrollably. How could ordinary creatures defy the majesty of dragons?\n\nSilver light appeared in mid-air, and after a flash of silver light, a figure materialized out of thin air. Gray light particles condensed beneath him, and another great dragon appeared. Although this dragon was smaller, it emanated a strange golden-gray luster. It was Nian Bing and Oscar. Nian Bing, seated on Oscar's back, calmly asked, \"Greetings, Prince Rong. May I know the purpose of your visit?\"\n\nPrince Rong's expression flickered as he looked at the eight great dragons in the sky. These were true dragons, and there were eight of them. While his knightly orders were the strongest on the Yangguang Continent, they held no advantage before the great dragons. Looking at his grandson riding the dragon, Prince Rong felt a hint of amusement. It was this very grandson who had asked him to bring people to the Lost Continent for development, and now he was asking him. After a moment of thought, he replied, \"We are not here for war. The four-kingdom peace treaty established our previous relationship. Our empire arrived on this continent via waterway. However, due to the scarcity of water element magicians, we are currently lacking water sources. We were wondering if you could share some water with us. Rest assured, our Huarong Empire will only develop on the other side and will not interfere with you.\"\n\nIt turned out that after Prince Rong brought his people to the Lost Continent, they immediately began development. However, he soon discovered that water sources had become the most significant limiting factor. The Huarong Empire certainly had the most magicians among the four empires, but they had few water element magicians. The existing water element magicians were all from the former Qilu Empire. Forget about building lakes; even providing water for the army and craftsmen had become a problem. After all, none of them possessed the innate energy that could absorb water elements and cause large-scale rainfall like Nian Bing, Lan Chen, or Long Ling.\n\nNian Bing gracefully descended from the dragon's back and smiled, \"That is easily arranged. After all, we all came from the Yangguang Continent, and this Lost Continent is so vast. Regarding the water source issue, how about this: we will be responsible for excavating a river about thirty zhang wide, which will pass through your location and we will ensure the river remains full.\"\n\nPrince Rong smiled, \"You've become more capable with age, my boy. It seems my initial judgment was quite accurate.\"\n\nNian Bing returned the smile, \"Prince Rong, I am now representing the Ice Moon Empire.\" As he spoke, he winked at his grandfather.\n\nPrince Rong blinked, \"Are you saying that the provision of water has conditions?\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Naturally, there are some conditions. The Huarong Empire is located in the southern part of the Yangguang Continent and has many crops that we lack. Furthermore, the climate of this Lost Continent is mild. Therefore, I hope to share resources with the Huarong Empire. We provide water, and you provide some resources that we need. What do you say?\"\n\nPrince Rong glared at Nian Bing with feigned annoyance, \"You rascal, aren't you just taking advantage to extort us?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Water is the source of life. Given the current situation of the Lost Continent, water is the most crucial thing. I don't think you would be stingy, Prince Rong.\"\n\nPrince Rong glanced at the great dragons in the sky. Even without his grandson present, his army couldn't deal with these dragons, let alone seize water sources. He nodded, \"Alright, as you wish. However, you must excavate this river quickly. Otherwise, it will be very difficult for us.\" He saw no need to hide anything in front of his grandson.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and suddenly shouted, \"Brother Xialu!\"\n\nA black figure leaped high from behind the Ice Moon Empire's army. Black light instantly expanded, splitting towards the ground as if cleaving the heavens and earth. With a thunderous roar, a rift extended rapidly into the distance, crossing five miles in the blink of an eye and reaching the Huarong Empire's army. The rift was about ten zhang deep and thirty zhang wide, precisely as Nian Bing had described, lacking only water.\n\n\"God of War, God of War, God of War!\" the Ice Moon Empire's army roared madly. Xialu had already earned the title of God of War when he completed Ice Moon Lake in a few days. Now, out of the dozen or so rivers extending outwards from Ice Moon Lake, more than two-thirds were his work.\n\nPrince Rong watched as Xialu floated down beside Nian Bing and nodded, \"Good. What resources do you need? Tell me.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Grandfather, Xialu and I will accompany you to the Huarong Empire's encampment. Firstly, to confirm the direction, and secondly, I have some matters to discuss with you.\"\n\nPrince Rong nodded, \"I know what you're going to say. Come with me, grandson and grandfather. It's time for us to have a good talk.\"",

    "content": "As Nian Bing led the large contingent of the Ice Moon Empire into the Lost Continent, on the Divine Continent, in a cave.\n\nSix people sat in a circle, looking no different from ordinary people. Among them, one person, with a pale complexion and only one arm remaining, was the God of Misfortune, Xia Yu.\n\n\"The Lost Continent has returned; this is something we cannot tolerate,\" said an elder who looked to be in his fifties. He wore an earth-yellow robe, and though his face was calm, his eyes betrayed a hint of anger. \"I never expected there to be so many powerful individuals on the Bright Continent. It seems our situation is not good. Brother Xia Yu, how is your injury? Did you see the state of the Lost Continent on your way back?\"\n\nXia Yu shook his head and said, \"I returned using a pre-arranged spatial teleportation array. I can only confirm that the Lost Continent has returned, but I don't know the situation there.\"\n\nThe elder said, \"Two High Gods, thirteen God-level experts, and in the end, only you returned. Is that human truly as terrifying as you described?\"\n\nA hint of fear appeared in Xia Yu's eyes. \"Yes, the mental power of that human is beyond our imagination. In just one exchange, Gu Long was killed by his mental power physical attack. If I hadn't run fast, I might not have been able to bring back this news at all. Lord Xi Jie, you must make plans early.\"\n\nLord Xi Jie pondered, \"There is nothing to plan now. The Lost Continent has returned; they will not forget the hatred of ten thousand years ago. We have been lying dormant on this continent for so long, it is time to leave.\"\n\nXia Yu said urgently, \"But, Lord Xi Jie. The strength of those humans is indeed formidable, and we don't understand the situation of the Lost Continent. Although many strong individuals have emerged among our Earth Gods in the past ten thousand years, judging by the situation ten thousand years ago, as long as the Lost Continent has been developing, I'm afraid...\"\n\nXi Jie raised his hand to stop Xia Yu from speaking further. He said calmly, \"Don't forget, we still have the support of the True Gods. Just as the True Gods sealed the Lost Continent once, they can do it a second time. Last time, when the True Gods issued a decree ordering us to deal with the white people of the Bright Continent, they entered a deep slumber for cultivation. We can remain inactive for now, but we must mobilize all the Gods and divine people on the Divine Continent. When we have the support of the three True Gods, the fate of those ordinary humans will not change. Among our eight High Gods, the Dragon God is not aligned with us, so we don't need to notify him. You few will lead our divine people and guard the border between the Lost Continent and the Divine Continent. As long as we can defend our territory before the True Gods awaken, it will be enough. At the same time, send people to scout the interior of the Lost Continent to see what's happening there. This time, be careful. If there are any more slip-ups, don't blame me for being merciless.\"\n\nThree golden lights lit up from Xi Jie's hands and chest, and the immense pressure caused the other High Gods present to lower their heads. Originally, High Gods were not ranked, but when Xi Jie reached his current realm, he became the leader among the High Gods and the god of all divine people.\n\n\"Xia Yu, your Imperial Pole Acupoint has exploded, and you can no longer be one of the High Gods. From now on, you are demoted to an ordinary god. You have disappointed me greatly in this matter. If you had all acted with all your might to destroy the process of unsealing in the beginning, the current situation would not have arisen. Tell me, how should I deal with you?\"\n\nXia Yu trembled all over and knelt on the ground, \"Lord Xi Jie, for the sake of our past status as fellow High Gods, please give me another chance.\"\n\nXi Jie snorted, \"Give you another chance? Where would that place the dignity of a god?\" Looking at the trembling Xia Yu, his tone softened slightly. \"Now is a time when we need people. Your transgressions will be noted for now. If there are any further mistakes, I will let you know what it means to wish you were dead.\"\n\n...\n\nAfter dealing with matters between the four empires, Nian Bing, along with Feng Nu, Mao Mao, and the Seven Dragon Kings, entered the interior of the Lost Continent with You You and Ping Chao. Xi Lu, Lan Chen, and Long Ling remained at Ice Moon Lake to assist the four empires in reclaiming the Lost Continent. Xi Lu originally wanted to go with them, but there was no one who could replace him in opening up rivers, so he ultimately stayed behind. To Nian Bing's relief, although the Lost Continent appeared to be a vast expanse of yellow earth, it had not turned into a desert. If it had become a desert, even the strongest mage would probably be unable to improve it. After months of effort, the reclamation had begun to show results, and the first batch of crops had been successfully harvested and were edible. Now, Nian Bing could only hope that, as Galanthis had said, the attack from the Divine Continent would not come too soon. This trip was led by You You, and their target was the remaining survivors on the Lost Continent.\n\nAlong the way, they saw many unique sights of the Lost Continent: vast stretches of barren land without any vegetation, bare mountains, and some dilapidated ruins whose original forms could no longer be discerned. They had also tried to find some remnants of the Lost Continent from the ruins, but they were soon disappointed. Ten thousand years had passed, and all the ruins had weathered to the point of being indistinguishable. Forget about written documents like paper; even solid rocks had turned into broken stones.\n\nThey had been flying in the air for about three days and had ventured deep into the interior of the Lost Continent. Whenever they encountered plains, Nian Bing would scatter the large quantities of seeds he carried in his Spatial Ring. Now, the rainfall on the Lost Continent was gradually increasing, and these seeds would eventually sprout. Every bit of green would bring more vitality to the Lost Continent!\n\n\"Stop for a moment,\" You You, who was sitting on the Dark Dragon King Ka Jie Othos, suddenly said.\n\nKa Jie Othos spread his dragon wings and controlled his massive body to hover in mid-air. You You clasped her hands together, with her index fingers touching. A black light appeared at the fingertips of her index fingers. The faint black light gradually grew stronger. A blood-red symbol lit up on her forehead, and a strange mental fluctuation spread outwards.\n\nNian Bing flew to You You's side, feeling her mental power fluctuations, and waited for her to emerge from her judgment. For the past three days, You You would stop periodically to locate her remembered position.\n\nAfter a while, the black light and blood-red light disappeared simultaneously, and You You opened her eyes. \"We're almost there. I can already feel their aura.\"\n\nNian Bing's spirit was lifted. \"Then let's hurry. The sooner we see them, perhaps we can learn about the current situation of the Lost Continent from them.\" Although You You had seen many scenes that the Lost Continent had experienced after the sealing was completed, they were only blurry images after all.\n\nThe group flew faster. Nian Bing concentrated his mental power, probing in the direction You You indicated. Since his acupoint had exploded last time, his mental power had finally returned to full control and, under the influence of the Imperial Pole Acupoint, had become even more overbearing than before. Now, when his mental power probed in a direction, the approximate signs and energy fluctuations within several hundred miles in that direction would be collected by the Heavenly Eye Acupoint. The ultimate Heavenly Eye Acupoint paired with the ultimate Imperial Pole Acupoint—their power was so great that perhaps even Kao back then had not imagined it.\n\nFeng Nu suddenly noticed Nian Bing's expression change. She couldn't help but retract her radiant red wings and came to his side, asking, \"What? Have you discovered something?\"\n\nA cold light flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. \"Quick, let's go. Something might be happening over there.\" As he spoke, his body in the air suddenly accelerated. The Seven-Colored Heavenly Eye Domain instantly exploded, enveloping everyone, including the Seven Dragon Kings. With the full assistance of the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, the speed of everyone's flight suddenly increased, turning into streaks of light as they flew towards the distance.\n\nAs they flew, Galanthis asked curiously, \"Nian Bing, what did you sense?\"\n\nNian Bing's expression was solemn. \"It's the aura of divine people.\" Everyone's hearts tightened simultaneously, and the speed of the Seven Dragon Kings' flight increased significantly.\n\nThe black light flickered in You You's eyes. \"I think I sense it too. They are angry and resisting something.\"\n\nNian Bing said to You You, \"Can you sense a more specific direction? I'm afraid we won't make it in time. We have to go there now.\"\n\nYou You nodded. \"I can try. Now that we're closer, my senses are much clearer.\"\n\nNian Bing floated onto Ka Jie Othos's back, took You You's small hand, and said, \"Then let's cooperate once and try it. You open your mind and transmit the location you feel to me.\"\n\nYou You closed her eyes, and a faint black airflow gathered in front of her. The blood-red symbol on her forehead lit up again. At this moment, she clearly felt a gentle energy being injected into her mind, tentatively merging with her consciousness. Through this energy, all nearby perceptions seemed to become clearer; it was a very pure mental power.\n\nEveryone around only saw a circle of silver light emanating from Nian Bing, enveloping his and You You's bodies. A golden eye opened at the center of Nian Bing's eyebrows, and the faint golden light merged with the dark red light on You You's forehead. As the two lights merged, the silver light around Nian Bing's body instantly became stronger. With a flash of silver light, the two figures disappeared from the back of the Dark Dragon King Ka Jie Othos simultaneously.\n\nGalanthis exclaimed in surprise, \"Damn it, this actually works! Spatial teleportation over long distances without a target. No wonder Brother Xi Lu often calls this kid Nian Bing a monster.\"\n\n\"You're not allowed to badmouth my brother Nian Bing,\" Mao Mao said indignantly, glaring at Galanthis. Ever since she took the Space Dragon King Ka Othos as her pet, her status had implicitly improved significantly. At this moment, she was sitting on Ka Othos's back, playing with Ka Othos's beautiful silver scales.\n\nGalanthis laughed heartily. \"How am I badmouthing him? I'm praising your brother Nian Bing for being capable!\"\n\nKa Othos, finally finding an opportunity to divert Mao Mao's attention from his pitiful dragon scales, would not let it pass. He chuckled and said, \"Mao Mao! I'm not one to stir up trouble, but if Galanthis is saying that about your brother Nian Bing, and I were you, I wouldn't be able to stand it.\"\n\nMao Mao giggled. \"Then that's fine! If you can't stand it, then you go ahead. It has nothing to do with me. I can endure it; my tolerance has always been very good.\"\n\n\"Uh... then, I'll endure it too. Pretend I didn't say anything.\"\n\nWith a flash of silver light, Nian Bing and You You appeared out of thin air. The moment their feet touched the ground, a green light flashed before Nian Bing's eyes, startling him. He quickly released his Heavenly Eye Domain, protecting You You within it, before he could observe his surroundings.\n\nBefore him, he saw a group of raggedly dressed people rushing madly in one direction. In that direction, more than a dozen people, whose bodies were shining with battle qi, were slaughtering wildly. Each battle qi attack took away several to over a dozen lives. The raggedly dressed people were of various races. Their movements were extremely fast, with almost every leap covering about ten feet. Most of them had no weapons in their hands, and like savages, they attacked the dozen people barehanded. The green light that had just passed was shot by a woman. She had a pair of translucent wings and was floating in the air, holding a short bow. Those green arrows flew out rapidly, and only she could pose some threat to those dozen enemies. This woman was shorter than ordinary humans, with a head of emerald-green hair flowing behind her. Although her clothes were severely damaged, exposing her fair skin, it could not conceal her captivating beauty. What surprised Nian Bing was that this woman had pointed ears, obviously different from other humans. Among these raggedly dressed people, Nian Bing saw dwarves similar to Xi Lu. These dwarves were very sturdy, but unfortunately, none of them possessed the strength of Xi Lu.\n\n\"Divine people, they are divine people,\" You You said angrily. Yes, the more than a dozen people who were continuously slaughtering were divine people. They were like playing, constantly unleashing waves of battle qi and easily killing the \"savages\" who rushed before them, without expending much effort. Hundreds of corpses had already piled up before them. Although they were surrounded by these \"savages,\" they showed no signs of tension, even chatting and laughing while killing.\n\nNian Bing let out a long roar, and his slender figure unfolded as he floated upwards. Although it was only a brief observation, he had already realized that the divine people here were not on the same level as the divine people he encountered on the Bright Continent last time. They were clearly low-level divine servants or demigods, and there wasn't even a single God-level expert among them. Seven streaks of light simultaneously shot out from Nian Bing's body; they were the Seven Divine Blades. The blade light flickered, and in mid-air, seven Nian Bings appeared simultaneously, which were the Seven-Elemental Shadow Puppets. With almost a single flicker, the seven shadow puppets arrived before the dozen divine people, blocking the charging \"savages.\"",

    "title": "Chapter 228 Lost the Mainland People (Part 1)",
    "content": "The Rank 11 forbidden curse, Scythe of Death, along with the Rank 11 fire forbidden curse, Roar of the Flame God Dragon, appeared simultaneously. The detonation of the two Rank 11 forbidden curses, in just an instant, forced back those gods. One god, slightly slower to react, was instantly bisected by the Scythe of Death, sending a rain of blood everywhere.\n\nThe savages' gazes all turned towards Nian Bing. The faces of those dozen or so gods changed drastically. Just then, a black current, mixed with a bloody glow, drifted out and enveloped the more than ten gods.\n\nNian Bing saw the corpses. Not a single one was intact. Blood stained the yellow earth, and the tragic scene ignited a powerful killing intent in his heart.\n\nThe gods simultaneously unleashed their battle qi. Instead of directly confronting the black current, they unleashed a full-power strike to block the black clouds and turned to flee. They knew that an opponent they could not contend with had arrived.\n\nBut could Nian Bing let them escape? Of course not. Faint golden light enveloped the bodies of those dozen or so gods like a barrier. As the light flickered, all the gods clearly felt a pain in their minds, and their escape speed immediately slowed. Then, they all saw seven intersecting, multicolored arcs of light. The faint glow was so brilliant, but to them, it was the call of death. The bodies of more than ten gods simultaneously froze. The moment the multicolored light disappeared, bloody fragments scattered everywhere amidst the rain of blood.\n\nUnder the interference of mental power, the gods were given no chance at all. Their shattered bodies were swallowed by the pursuing black clouds and, through intense corrosion, turned into pools of bloody water.\n\nNian Bing landed gracefully, like a heavenly god. The surrounding savages were stunned, staring blankly at Nian Bing. Nian Bing looked around. The surroundings were a sea of black. Among them, humans occupied the majority, followed by dwarves. As for those with emerald green hair, wings, and pointed ears, there were only a small number. Most of them held short bows, the only ones among this group of savages who possessed weapons. Unfortunately, although their arrows were shot accurately, they had been unable to break through the gods' battle qi earlier. Were these the remnants of the Lost Continent? Looking at them, Nian Bing felt a trace of pity, and at the same time, a sense of loss. These people's physical conditioning was clearly much stronger than ordinary people, but their resistance to the gods of the God Continent was a joke.\n\nThe savages' gazes gradually shifted from Nian Bing to Youyou. When they clearly saw Youyou's appearance, their stunned eyes gradually turned to fanaticism. First, the people in the innermost circle knelt down. Then, like ripples in water, the vast expanse of black knelt. They chattered something in their languages, their voices indistinct amidst their excitement, but clearly different from the languages of the Yangguang Continent, mainly in intonation. From the pronunciation, some parts could be understood. They seemed to be saying, \"The goddess has finally descended, Goddess, please save us.\"\n\nNian Bing and Youyou exchanged glances. Youyou said to Nian Bing, \"Can you help me bury these dead people?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded silently and directed the seven Shadow Puppets to dig pits on the spacious yellow earth beside them.\n\nYouyou looked at the \"savages\" kneeling on the ground, a wry smile appearing on her delicate face. She sighed, \"You can all get up. Don't be like this. I don't even fully understand what's going on. I'm not a goddess; I'm just an ordinary person.\"\n\nAs soon as she said this, the \"savages\" became chaotic. Excited voices erupted, and tens of thousands of people expressed their feelings, immediately making the scene extremely chaotic.\n\n\"Silence.\" Nian Bing shouted. His majestic killing of the gods earlier showed its deterrent effect. The \"savages\" immediately calmed down, their gazes focused on him.\n\nNian Bing said, \"If you are so chaotic, how can we understand the situation? We are here to help you. Please select a representative to talk to us.\" He didn't know if the savages could understand his words, so he spoke every word very clearly and radiated his mental power outward, expressing his goodwill.\n\nThe \"savages\" began to whisper amongst themselves. After a while, the green-haired woman who had caught Nian Bing's attention earlier walked out from the crowd. The \"savages\" parted a path, allowing her to reach Nian Bing and Youyou.\n\nThe woman walked up to Youyou and bowed. Youyou quickly helped her up and said, \"Don't be like this.\"\n\n\"Goddess, you have finally arrived. Please save us, your last companions.\" Her voice had a gentle quality. Although her intonation was still difficult to discern, with careful listening, her meaning could be understood.\n\nYouyou smiled wryly, \"I am truly not some goddess. Salvation is out of the question, but we are willing to help you. Are you really the only ones left on the Lost Continent? Do you have any records from the past? For example, any last words left by your ancestors.\"\n\nThe green-haired woman shook her head blankly, \"You call this cursed land the Lost Continent? We only have a legend that countless years ago, because we offended the gods, we were punished. The gods deprived us of most of our water and food, and our ancestors' numbers continuously decreased. If it weren't for the last source of water here, we would have died long ago. And in the legend, a goddess will come to save us. We have always longed for it, and your appearance is just like that goddess! A few days ago, the sky here suddenly changed, and the earth roared with tremors. We were all very scared, thinking that the gods were going to punish us again. But at that moment, we saw your divine miracle. Goddess, you have finally come, please, save us!\" As she spoke, tears continuously streamed down her face. In her trembling, her tattered clothes could not entirely cover her fair skin. Nian Bing, fearing he might see something he shouldn't, turned his head away.\n\nAt this moment, both Nian Bing and Youyou felt a strange sensation. The legend the green-haired woman spoke of was completely different from the records of the Lost Continent they knew. It seemed that the Lost Continent not only left this world back then but also lost their civilization. The green-haired woman's sorrow was completely from the heart. From the simple, almost foolish eyes of these \"savages,\" Nian Bing understood that they truly knew nothing.\n\nNian Bing's heart was filled with loss. It was not because these remnants of the Lost Continent, who clearly lacked much ability, could not help him, but because of the lost civilization of the Lost Continent. The civilization of an entire continent had completely vanished like this. Besides regret, he had no other feelings at this moment. At the same time, he felt more sympathy for these \"savages\" before him and secretly decided that he must help them escape their suffering. At the very least, he would not let them be harmed by the gods again.\n\nYouyou looked at the green-haired woman, her feelings similar to Nian Bing's. She said softly, \"Alright. I understand your situation. How did you get into conflict with those people earlier?\"\n\nAnger and grief flashed in the green-haired woman's eyes. \"They arrived here not long ago. Seeing unfamiliar compatriots, we were all very excited at first. However, after exchanging only a few words with them, those people suddenly burst into laughter. Two of them left. The remaining people immediately came to kill our companions. If not for the timely arrival of the Goddess and this Hero, I fear how many of our companions would have died.\"\n\nYouyou's expression changed drastically. \"You mean, someone among them left?\" As she spoke, her gaze turned towards Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing was also looking at her and shook his head. \"No need to chase them, Youyou. This might not be a bad thing. Rather than not knowing where the gods will attack from, it's better to fight a decisive battle here. At least we can start making preparations.\"\n\nYouyou lowered her head. \"Thank you. But can we...\"\n\nNian Bing interrupted Youyou. \"It's not a question of 'can we' anymore, but 'we must' do this. I didn't expect the harm the gods inflicted on the Lost Continent to be so severe. I absolutely do not want to see the Yangguang Continent become the second Lost Continent.\"\n\nJust then, the Seven Dragon Kings and others had also arrived. When these remnants of the Lost Continent saw the giant dragons descending from the sky, it became impossible to make them believe that Youyou was not a goddess.\n\nAs Youyou was explaining the situation to the Dragon Kings, Phoenix Girl, and Cat Cat, the woman who had spoken to Youyou earlier walked up to Nian Bing, looking at him with some curiosity. Suddenly, she loudly said, \"Hero, let's mate.\"\n\nSilence. The entire place fell into silence. Nian Bing clearly felt Phoenix Girl's unfriendly gaze and stammered, \"Miss, are you talking to me?\"\n\nThe green-haired woman showed no sign of shyness and continued to speak loudly, \"Of course! Hero, you are so powerful, I think our children will be very healthy. Although I am an elf and you are human, I don't think we will have any barriers.\" As she spoke, she looked at Nian Bing with eager, large eyes.\n\nNot long after, Nian Bing learned that for the sake of survival, women of the Lost Continent would mate with the strongest men they found attractive. Among them, because the elves had the weakest physique, their numbers had become the smallest over generations. Nian Bing's handsome appearance and formidable strength immediately won the favor of this elven woman. However, Nian Bing didn't know this now. Feeling Phoenix Girl's gaze, which felt like thorns on his back, his heart contracted, and he forced a smile, \"Miss, please don't joke. I don't think I know you.\"\n\nThe green elf woman laughed heartily, \"I am Ningzhi of the elves. Now we know each other, right?\"\n\n\"This... can we not discuss this issue?\" Nian Bing said awkwardly.\n\n\"Why?\" Ningzhi asked, blinking her large eyes at Nian Bing, a hint of confusion in her gaze.\n\nNian Bing was completely speechless. He turned to look at Phoenix Girl, seeking help with his eyes. Phoenix Girl snorted, \"Handle your own affairs. Hmm, it seems your punishment period needs to be extended. You're flirting with girls again.\"\n\n\"I, I'm wronged!\" If there were a river here, Nian Bing would truly want to drown himself in it.\n\nCat Cat giggled and came to Nian Bing's side, saying, \"Brother Nian Bing, what does 'mate' mean? Is it fun?\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Galanadis, who was gloating beside him, and said, \"Brother, do you have any tofu? Give me a piece.\"\n\nGalanadis blinked in surprise. \"What for?\"\n\nNian Bing wailed, \"Hit me to death with tofu.\"\n\nGalanadis winked at Nian Bing and said, \"What a great opportunity! Such a beautiful girl, aren't you tempted?\"\n\n\"I..., fine, Galanadis, although I'm not one to hold a grudge, I'll remember this. I wonder how Xue Jing will feel knowing you're hitting on girls outside. Miss Ningzhi here, this is my elder brother. He's much more capable than me and is the most suitable for mating. Look, he's also a Dragon King. Think about it, if your elves mate with dragons, the children born will definitely be healthier.\"\n\nNingzhi's beautiful eyes lit up. \"Yes! It would be good to mate with a dragon. You, hello. Then let's mate. You will be the father of my eleventh child.\" Saying this, she walked towards Galanadis.\n\nNian Bing looked at Galanadis's greatly changed expression and said, \"Elder Brother! Look, how thoughtful I am, I've given the beauty to you. Didn't you say you were tempted? Seize the opportunity quickly.\"\n\n\"You...\"\n\n\"Alright, stop fooling around. Miss, perhaps our customs are different, but they will not mate with you.\" Kajoosis finally couldn't stand it and ended the farce.\n\nAfter everyone discussed, the Seven Dragon Kings, Cat Cat, Youyou, and Ping Chao stayed behind, while Nian Bing and Phoenix Girl hurried back to Ice Moon Lake. Since some gods had escaped, the army of the God Continent was likely to arrive in this land in the near future. They had to react in the shortest possible time.\n\nWhile flying through the air, Nian Bing tentatively asked, \"Phoenix Girl, you're not still angry, are you?\"\n\nPhoenix Girl rolled her eyes at him. \"Do I look like someone who gets angry easily?\"\n\n\"Like... uh, no, of course not.\" Nian Bing blurted out the first word instinctively, then realized he had said the wrong thing. Seeing Phoenix Girl's displeased expression, he quickly corrected himself.\n\nPhoenix Girl snorted, \"Do you want to become the father of that elf girl's eleventh child? I think you really want to.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing smiled apologetically, \"How could that be! With you all here, why would I even think of other women?\"\n\nFeng Nu snorted, \"Then give me a detailed explanation of your relationship with Mu Jing and Luo Rou.\"\n\n\"Right! And Maomao too.\"\n\nNian Bing protested, \"I have no relationship with them! What's there to explain?\"\n\n\"No relationship? That's not right. Do you think we haven't seen anything these past few days? The way Mu Jing and Luo Rou look at you... especially Mu Jing. When she secretly watches you, it's like she wants to devour you. As for Maomao, although you call her your sister, judging by her behavior, she probably can never leave you. You also promised to reserve living space for Luo Rou and Mu Jing in the place we'll be living in seclusion. Doesn't this require an explanation?\"\n\nNian Bing was speechless. Although he hadn't paid much attention to it himself, he had to admit that what Feng Nu said was true. He thought with grief and indignation, \"Look, my punishment is really going to be extended indefinitely.\" Just then, his lips felt a warmth. The sudden tenderness startled him. He instinctively hugged Feng Nu and looked at her in surprise.\n\n\"Silly. I'm just joking with you.\" Feng Nu's eyes were full of laughter. \"I know what kind of person you are. You've been through too much these past few days. I can see you're already very tired. Whether or not they truly have feelings for you, as long as you know your own limits, we trust you. Even if you do take them in, as long as I'm the one you love the most, I don't have any objections.\"\n\nNian Bing was overjoyed. He deeply kissed Feng Nu's lips, \"What you said is too wonderful.\"\n\nFeng Nu glared at him, \"Just a few nice words, and you're already showing your true colors. I knew you had such wicked thoughts long ago.\"\n\n\"Ah! I'm being wronged! It's not... what I meant was...\"\n\nFeng Nu hugged Nian Bing, \"Alright, no more explanations needed. Nian Bing, I also really want to find a place to live in seclusion with you now, without having to worry about these matters. The outcome of the Lost Continent was something neither of us expected. Can we really fight against those gods?\"\n\nNian Bing hugged Feng Nu's soft and elastic body back and said calmly, \"I don't know. But it's not entirely impossible. To put it simply, although we have many strong individuals on our side, this time we have six hundred mages brought from the Ice Moon Empire, including one hundred elite mages from the Ice God Tower. The one thousand fire mages from the Huorong Empire might also be useful. They were trained by the Rong family, so their coordination is good. Once they act as a group, their magic is incredibly powerful. Many people think the Fire Dragon Knights of the Rong family are the most fearsome, but they're wrong. The most fearsome part of the Rong family is those thousand fire mages. Although only a few have reached the Archmage realm, and only my grandfather is a Divine Descendant, under his command, the attacks these mages can unleash are almost unimaginable. The Olan Empire and the Langmu Empire also have some mages. Luo Rou and I discussed this, and we've reorganized them according to their magic disciplines. We have a total of two thousand five hundred mages, which can be said to be the most outstanding mages on the Radiant Continent. With them and our two thousand elites from the Blood Lion Cult, I dare say we can contend with ordinary gods. Even demigods and god-level experts might not be able to do anything to them. One thing you must understand is that there are only about ten thousand gods. With every god that dies, their power weakens. The Great Divine Lords are truly terrifying, especially those few Archgods. If we were at Ice Valley, I would have no confidence at all. But now that my spiritual power is unleashed, if I get the chance, I'm confident I can contend with one or two Archgod-level experts, or even more. My advantage lies in my spiritual power, which they don't possess. I predict this battle won't be resolved in one go; it will likely be a long-term struggle. This time, besides the two knight orders, the Huorong Empire also transported fifty thousand elite troops by sea. Combined with the armies of our three countries, we should have around two hundred thousand troops. While these troops may not be enough to fight the gods directly, they can at least serve as a delaying force. The combined strength of our mages and auxiliaries will prevent the gods from launching large-scale destructive attacks. As long as there's enough time for my spiritual power to recover, we can slowly wear down the enemy.\"\n\nFeng Nu's expression flickered slightly. \"No wonder you invited the four kingdoms to open up this land. So you had this plan. Then those two hundred thousand troops are just cannon fodder?\" Her gaze gradually became angry. She hadn't expected Nian Bing to be using them.\n\nNian Bing's eyes flashed with cold light. \"I don't want this either, but this is our only chance. Do you want to see the tens of millions of lives on the Radiant Continent suffer? Do you want to see the Radiant Continent become like the Lost Continent is now? For the future of the Radiant Continent, sacrifice is inevitable. At critical moments, I'm even willing to sacrifice myself. Of the eight Archgods, one is dead, and one has reincarnated. The Dragon God won't side with them, but there are still five Archgods among them. Any one of them can cause us immense trouble. They can even easily destroy a city. Do you know how many people are in a city on the Radiant Continent?\"\n\nFeng Nu looked at Nian Bing's determined gaze, and the anger in her heart gradually subsided. What Nian Bing said was true. Although his methods were cruel, it was indeed the only way. Currently, the gods' biggest weakness is their inflexibility. Direct confrontation is more beneficial to the Radiant Continent. Otherwise, if so many gods were scattered across the Radiant Continent, the entire continent would be plagued by disasters everywhere. However, she still found it difficult to accept Nian Bing's idea.\n\nNian Bing sighed and continued, \"I've calculated carefully. The strong individuals on our side include Chen Mo, Ling'er can barely be considered one, my father-in-law the Dragon King, Mother Dragon, Father Dragon, the Seven Dragon Kings, Lord Xilou, and Youyou's strength is unclear to me, but she should count as one. Maomao's pets are also unknown. Plus my grandfather, that's all. In a head-on confrontation, even all of us combined might not be able to deal with those five Archgods. Without some special methods, we won't even have a chance! Perhaps you think my methods are a bit unethical, but this is the best method I can think of. Perhaps I'll have to resort to some unconventional means.\"\n\nFeng Nu bit her lip and asked, \"Do the Dragon Kings know your plan?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded gravely. \"I've been discussing it with them these past few months. I've considered all possibilities. Brother Katjosis even consulted the Great Dragon God. Most importantly, we all know this is the most likely way to succeed. All we can do is minimize losses. For the sake of more people's lives, we must make sacrifices.\"\n\nFeng Nu asked, \"Then what about the three True Gods you mentioned? What if they also participate in this war?\"\n\nNian Bing said without hesitation, \"If they participate in this war, I will have everyone retreat immediately to the Radiant Continent. However, I don't think that situation will occur. At their level, they are already free from desires. And even if they do appear, there are people who can deal with them. Speaking of which...\" He couldn't help but think of that pair of sisters with completely similar auras yet completely identical appearances. He wondered if Kao and Tianxiang had found a way to fuse the two different energies of life and death. Only they could contend with those three True Gods.\n\nFeng Nu looked deeply at Nian Bing. \"No matter what you decide, you must take me with you. This time, don't abandon me again, okay?\"\n\nNian Bing stroked Feng Nu's soft hair. \"I've never abandoned you. I said, in my heart, no one can replace your position. This time, for the Radiant Continent, we must concentrate all our strength. Feng Nu, if we truly have to die, let's die together. I've always thought that would also be a kind of happiness. Now, the lives of over two hundred thousand people and our own lives are in the hands of destiny. Let's take a gamble and see what our fate holds.\" Feng Nu looked deeply at Nian Bing. \"Then let's gamble. As long as I'm with you, I'll accompany you in any gamble.\"\n\nA dark cloud drifted from the distance, bringing a chill to the warm earth. As the cloud obscured the sun, the cold intensified. The Radiant Continent had already entered the warm spring. The location of the Lost Continent was almost parallel to the Radiant Continent. Looking at the rolling dark clouds in the sky, Nian Bing smiled, \"Spring rain is coming. Let it fully nourish this land. Perhaps in a few days, the Lost Continent will gradually unfold. Although the original races here have declined, it has, after all, returned.\" He sighed, \"It's a shame I forgot to set up a spatial teleportation array near Ice Moon Lake. Otherwise, we wouldn't have to travel such a long distance. I've already set up teleportation arrays in the settlements of those survivors. When we return, it will be much easier.\"\n\nFeng Nu's worry was undeniable. She sighed lightly. \"Nian Bing, we haven't been alone together for a long time. Do you remember how we met?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Of course I remember. Back then, your appetite truly shocked me. If I remember correctly, the dish I made for you was pigeon rice, right?\"\n\nFeng Nu nodded, \"Yes! It was really delicious. The food you make is the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. When we retire in the future, you have to make it for me every day!\"\n\nA bright light streaked across the sky, and lightning instantly illuminated the surrounding space. Immediately after, a thunderous roar sounded, and fine raindrops began to fall. Driven by the gentle breeze, they filled the space between heaven and earth. A faint seven-colored light screen emanated from Nian Bing, blocking the rain a meter away from his body. Looking at the glistening raindrops, he hugged Feng Nu's tender body tighter. \"I also really hope to retire with you soon. Having you by my side is my greatest happiness. Mom and Dad have safely returned. When we retire, let's go to Peach Blossom Forest.\"\n\n\"Peach Blossom Forest? What kind of place is that?\" Feng Nu asked.\n\nNian Bing's eyes showed deep emotion. \"It's the place where I lived for eight years. When my parents were sacrificed by the Ice Snow Goddess and sealed to the south, I jumped into the river to escape. My master saved me. Master lived in that Peach Blossom Forest. There, I learned culinary arts from my master for eight years. Master is my benefactor. Without him, I would probably have died long ago. Returning home is not my ultimate goal; Peach Blossom Forest is. When I left, I burned it into an scorched earth. When we return, I will rebuild it. If my master has a spirit, he'll be very happy to see us living happily.\" In Nian Bing's heart, the person he was most grateful for in his life was Cha Ji. Cha Ji had guided him to the pinnacle of culinary arts and given him a new life.\n\nFeng Nu pointed forward. \"We've arrived at that ruin again.\" Nian Bing followed Feng Nu's gaze. Vast expanses of dilapidated stones covered hundreds of square kilometers below. Scattered rocks and faintly recognizable stone structures hinted that this was once a city. From the stone walls that were not completely damaged, it could be seen that the city walls were at least thirty zhang high, clearly a large city. However, within this great city, there was no longer any sign of life. When they went to find the survivors, they had passed by here. At that time, they had even specifically gone down to search for traces of the Lost Continent, but apart from stones, they had found almost nothing useful. Not even simple carvings existed.\n\n\"It's a pity this is just a ruin. It's really sad. When the Lost Continent returned, I was always worried about the power of this continent being too strong, but now I feel the opposite.\"\n\nFeng Nu looked up at Nian Bing and suddenly said, \"Shall we go down to take shelter from the rain?\"\n\nNian Bing was surprised. With their strength, why would they need to take shelter from the rain? But looking at Feng Nu's hopeful eyes, he couldn't bear to refuse. Since returning from the Divine Continent, he hadn't had any alone time with Feng Nu. Without saying more, he nodded and floated down towards the ruins. Inside the ruin filled with rubble, a deathly silence enveloped the area. The two quickly found a place that seemed to have been a stone house before. Although only a part of it remained, it was enough to shelter from the rain.",

    "content": "Raindrops fell with a rustling sound. Feng Nü nestled in Nian Bing's arms, watching the falling raindrops outside. A hint of tenderness flowed in her eyes. \"If only we could watch like this every time it rains, how wonderful it would be! Nian Bing, hold me tighter, please. I'm a little cold.\"\n\nNian Bing held Feng Nü closer. At this moment, he naturally wouldn't say anything to spoil the mood. Feng Nü's delicate body was exceptionally soft, and her faint virgin scent continuously stimulated his senses. But at this moment, his heart was filled only with deep love, without any lust. He wished they could stay peacefully like this forever, until the end of time.\n\nThe rain continued to fall. Spring rain was always known for its continuous downpour. The rain wasn't heavy; sheets of water continuously washed over the desolate continent. Nian Bing recalled the seeds he had sown. Nurtured by the rain, they should have sprouted by now. With the appearance of plants, the vitality of this continent would grow stronger and stronger—that was what he most wanted to see.\n\nThe two embraced and watched the rain, forgetting time, as if this short period of less than half an hour had passed in an instant, or perhaps a century.\n\n\"Nian Bing, do you know why I asked you to come down with me?\" Feng Nü looked up at her lover.\n\nNian Bing stroked her long hair and smiled, \"Of course, I do. Perhaps this is our only chance to be alone together before the great battle. Let's stay until the rain stops.\"\n\nFeng Nü sighed softly, \"Aren't you afraid of wasting time?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"In my heart, nothing is more important than your love for me. Moreover, the time it takes for a rain shower doesn't represent anything. Even if those divine beings are fast, they can't reach the place where the remnants are in less than ten days. I've calculated carefully. That place is a three-day flight from our Ice Moon Lake. It's at least a five-day flight from the Divine Continent. This is calculated based on my aerial flight speed. While some divine beings are stronger than me, the vast majority are not as fast. A round trip, even at their fastest, would take ten days. With ten days, it's enough for us to make arrangements. Don't speak. Let's finish watching this rain. I really like this feeling right now.\"\n\nFeng Nü pressed herself against Nian Bing's chest and suddenly chuckled. \"Hero, let's mate.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned and said with a wry smile, \"You still haven't forgotten! I really don't know how the elf girls can be so passionate. Stop embarrassing me.\"\n\nFeng Nü's pretty face flushed slightly. \"Silly. I'm serious.\"\n\nNian Bing's body trembled slightly. \"Feng Nü, you...\" At this moment, his heart was filled with deep affection. Of course, he understood why Feng Nü said this; she didn't want to leave any regrets before the great battle.\n\nFeng Nü looked up at him, her eyes flowing, and said with a light smile, \"Hero, let's mate.\" She looked at Nian Bing. Although she was a little shy, her voice was certain. In Feng Nü's heart, she wasn't optimistic about this confrontation with the divine beings. However, war was inevitable. Before the war arrived, she wanted to give herself to the person she loved most. The affairs of the Phoenix Tribe were settled; she was willing to dedicate herself completely to Nian Bing. Even if she died in the final battle, she would have no regrets. Love needed to be sublimated. Only through the complete fusion of soul and body could they fully experience their true love!\n\nNian Bing looked at Feng Nü dazedly. Feng Nü was also looking at him. Gradually, Feng Nü closed her eyes and took Nian Bing's hands, placing them on her burning, smooth face.\n\n\"So beautiful, she's truly beautiful.\" He lowered his head and when he kissed her soft, moist lips, a surge of burning flame ignited. Their kiss turned into a deep, passionate kiss. Nian Bing's arms around Feng Nü became even tighter. Feng Nü cast aside all her reserve and responded passionately. She knew that at this moment, Nian Bing belonged entirely to her.\n\nOscar, who was one with Nian Bing, was preparing to watch a good show. Suddenly, he realized his perception of the outside world had disappeared. He couldn't help but curse, \"Good for you, Nian Bing. Even at this time, you haven't forgotten to seal me. Damn it.\"\n\nA thick spring atmosphere arose in the half-ruined stone house, solidifying and not dispersing. Nian Bing's robe was already spread on the ground, and a multicolored halo enveloped their bodies like a large cocoon. Feng Nü was beautiful all over. Her fair skin with a hint of blush, her long, shapely legs, her full, abundant breasts, and her mysterious virgin place. Although Feng Nü and Lan Chen were sisters, they gave Nian Bing completely different feelings. When he was with Lan Chen, Nian Bing felt like he was melting an ice mountain, but when he was with Feng Nü, Nian Bing found himself being melted by her.\n\nYears of pent-up emotions exploded at this moment. The two completely opened their hearts and gave themselves to each other. Deep love and lust condensed in the depths of their souls. As they became one in Feng Nü's body, a strong sense of satisfaction filled both their minds and bodies. The pain seemed to become insignificant. They held each other tightly, as if they were merging into one.\n\nNian Bing's tense nerves relaxed after many days. At this moment, he had forgotten everything. He continuously explored in wave after wave of thrusts. At first, he was afraid of hurting his beloved, but when his beloved below wildly responded, her elastic body and tight embrace reacted crazily. Reason was cast aside. In their frenzied thrusts, they jointly reached one peak after another. Their emotions sublimated in the union of desire and spirit, their hearts tightly bound together. What they offered was the essence of their lives.\n\nAs the spring rain gradually thinned with the passing of the dark clouds, and the sound of rain became sparse, the passionate embrace in the spring-filled stone house gradually subsided. Feng Nü lay in Nian Bing's arms, panting. Her delicate skin radiated an alluring blush. This was her first experience, and her heart trembled slightly. After all, she was a young girl. Besides satisfaction, there was naturally a bit of shyness in her heart.\n\nLooking at the gradually stopping raindrops outside, Nian Bing felt extremely satisfied. Looking at the scattered clothes on the ground, he suddenly thought, \"Next time, should I bring a quilt in my spatial ring? No, one won't be enough. I should bring three.\" The union in the rain had a different kind of feeling. Although it was Feng Nü's first time, her passion had almost melted him. Especially since she had practiced martial arts since childhood, her stamina was much better than Bing Yun's. Fortunately, his body had undergone several modifications, and he had the support of immense life essence; otherwise, he would have been the one to surrender first.\n\n\"Should we go now?\" Feng Nü murmured in Nian Bing's arms. How could she bear to leave this feeling? But she knew it was time to leave.\n\n\"En, rest a little longer. Can you walk now?\" Nian Bing chuckled softly, stroking Feng Nü's smooth, full back and buttocks, lingering on his wife's beauty.\n\nFeng Nü pouted slightly. \"I want you to carry me. I really wonder if you practice magic or martial arts.\" In pain, she had gained immense satisfaction. Now she finally understood why her sister would let out such intense moans when she was with Nian Bing. She even regretted that everything between her and Nian Bing had come too late.\n\nNian Bing chuckled. \"Weren't you even more passionate than me just now? Ah, look quickly, it's a rainbow.\" His voice was filled with surprise and a bit of joy.\n\nFeng Nü looked up and saw the infatuated glow in Nian Bing's eyes. Following his gaze, she saw a colorful rainbow stretching across the sky, with distinct red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and violet colors. Under the light of the newly reappeared sun, it looked so enchanting. \"Carry me up, shall we go out and see it?\" After the prolonged storm, she truly had no strength left to walk.\n\nNian Bing hugged Feng Nü's delicate body and stood up. He first put on a piece of clothing, then took another robe and carefully draped it over her, afraid of the chill after the rain. Feng Nü wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed her face against his firm chest, listening to the sound of his heartbeat. Nian Bing scooped up Feng Nü's legs and picked her up. After kissing her lips, he walked out of the stone house.\n\nThe air after the rain mingled with the fresh scent of the earth, making it exceptionally refreshing to breathe. The rainbow became even more vibrant. As soon as they stepped out of the stone house, Nian Bing suddenly felt some subtle changes around him. Besides the rainbow, there seemed to be a faint red light drifting not far away. With a thought, carried by the wind element, he floated away with Feng Nü in his arms.\n\nLooking down from the air, the red light became even more distinct. Upon closer inspection, it was evident that the red light was emanating from a pointed tower-like structure in the center of the ruins. The structure was leaning due to weathering, on the verge of collapse at any moment. Feng Nü's body suddenly became hot, and she let out a low cry, \"Nian Bing, quickly! Let's go there! Something seems to be calling me.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes flashed with divine light. He pressed his right hand into the air, and dense innate energy mixed with elements surged around the building. With a rumble, the pointed tower was pushed down. The originally misty red light immediately intensified, and the radiance shot up into the sky, competing in brilliance with the rainbow in the sky. Feng Nü's eyes widened. She suddenly broke free from Nian Bing's arms. The royal feathers of the Phoenix Tribe floated out, and golden-red wings carried her swiftly towards the rising red light. Fearing for her safety, Nian Bing quickly accelerated and followed. When they arrived above the red light, they clearly saw that on the ground where the pointed tower once stood, a red pattern had appeared. It was a phoenix pattern. Fiery red light billowed up. The phoenix seemed alive, emitting a faint warmth.\n\nNian Bing and his companions had seen this pointed tower when they first came to this place. Because the tower was on the verge of collapse at any moment, Nian Bing had used his mental power as eyes to examine the interior. At that time, he hadn't found anything inside the tower, nor had the ground changed in any way. However, how could this phoenix pattern suddenly appear?\n\nThe two descended gracefully. As they entered the mass of red light, Nian Bing's strange feeling became even more pronounced. It was clearly an energy. Although not very strong, it existed, and it was real. Feng Nü's body was bathed in red light. As her body merged into the rising phoenix light, a low voice slowly sounded, \"Great Phoenix! Welcome back.\"\n\nWith a creaking sound, the ground actually cracked open, and a staircase extended downwards. A mist floated out from the passage below. Nian Bing quickly pulled Feng Nü aside and activated his light-attribute innate energy to enter the passage, clearing away the musty air. He brought light and heat into this deep passage. With the cleansing of the light element, the musty air was quickly dispelled, and the air became fresh again in a short while.\n\n\"What was that voice just now?\" Nian Bing asked doubtfully. There were no more people on the Lost Continent, but that voice just now was very clear, and it contained a hint of authority.\n\nFeng Nü shook her head and said, \"I don't know either. That seems to be a voice left by magic. Nian Bing, do you remember the memories of the Ancestral Phoenix we obtained on the Phoenix Volcano? The ancestor said that he was once the god worshipped by the Lost Continent, and his image was the totem of the Lost Continent. Perhaps, the phoenix bloodline in me activated the mechanism here. And the appearance of the rainbow was just to lure the energy here to disperse. It seems we have found the true ruins of the Lost Continent.\" Saying this, her eyes held a hint of curiosity and excitement.\n\nA hint of joy appeared in both their eyes. After no more musty air emanated from below, Feng Nü flew with her wings, and Nian Bing walked down with her.\n\nThe stone steps were long, extending down a full hundred meters before they reached the end. The darkness in the passage did not affect them. Nian Bing's light magic displayed its due power; a simple illumination spell lit up the surroundings brightly. The stone walls on both sides of the passage were very smooth, clearly indicating they were artificially carved. Although some musty air had emerged earlier, the passage was generally dry and clean. When they reached the deepest part of the passage, a huge door appeared before them. The door had a circular pattern. Within the raised circular area, there was a lifelike phoenix. To their surprise, the phoenix pattern was inlaid with rubies, and there were no gaps in the rubies, as if it had been carved from a large piece of gemstone before being inlaid. A faint red light shimmered, which was the energy of fire, but within the fire, there was also a hint of coolness. The phoenix totem confirmed the thoughts in Nian Bing and Feng Nü's minds. The two stopped before the door. Nian Bing tentatively reached out to push it, but the stone door did not move. He tried to probe inside with his mental power but was blocked by a gentle energy, preventing him from going further.",

    "content": "Nian Bing frowned slightly and murmured to himself, \"This door is very strange. Feng Nü, have you noticed anything?\" As he spoke, he turned to look at Feng Nü. When he saw her, he found her gaze focused on the protruding ruby phoenix on the stone door, her eyes filled with a thoughtful light, as if she hadn't heard his question.\n\nFeng Nü's robe fell, revealing her perfect, delicate body. A faint red light enveloped her skin, and her eyes gradually brightened. The Royal Feathers on her back spread outwards, and she floated up, coming to rest directly in front of the stone door. She raised her hand and gently caressed the ruby sculpture, her eyes showing deep emotion. The faint red glow gradually turned golden, and as she stroked it, it merged into the ruby. The gem's light grew brighter and brighter. Suddenly, within the embossed phoenix pattern, the phoenix's eyes lit up. A flash of light met Feng Nü's gaze.\n\nFeng Nü's delicate body went into a brief stupor. Immediately after, a clear phoenix cry echoed from Feng Nü's mouth. The red light surrounding her body grew stronger and stronger, and the scorching airflow forced Nian Bing to retreat, releasing his Heaven's Eye domain to avoid being affected by the phoenix flames. Feng Nü's body was changing rapidly. Nian Bing could vaguely sense a majestic aura emanating from her. The moment the clear phoenix cry vanished, the red light instantly retracted, and Feng Nü's figure reappeared. She was a fiery red phoenix, every feather as translucent as a ruby. She had a pair of majestic red eyes, and her body feathers were entirely carved from ruby, shining with dazzling light.\n\nNian Bing exclaimed, \"Phoenix Eight Transformations, Phoenix Awakening, Body Transformation into Phoenix.\" Yes, at this moment, Feng Nü had once again used her eighth transformation. Nian Bing suddenly realized that the Feng Nü who had completed the eighth transformation bore a striking resemblance to the phoenix pattern on the stone door. As he pondered the changes, the red phoenix flew up. In a very short distance, it instantly accelerated and charged directly towards the stone door. Before Nian Bing could exclaim, Feng Nü, transformed into the fiery phoenix, merged strangely into the stone door. The red light erupted with even more dazzling brilliance, and the entire passageway seemed to tremble slightly. Immediately after, the massive stone door before them, illuminated by the light, gradually began to rise. The rumbling sound shook, and a scorching sensation was released from within the door.\n\nNian Bing stared at everything before him in astonishment and quickly stepped forward, heading into the door. When he saw the full picture of the rising stone door, he finally understood why he couldn't push it open. The door's thickness was beyond his imagination, extending inwards for nearly thirty feet. Moreover, judging by the magical aura emanating from the stone door, this massive gate definitely contained magical seals and restrictions. Passing through the passageway formed by the gate, Nian Bing arrived inside. The first thing he saw was a shining golden totem on the ground.\n\nIt was a spacious, square stone chamber, about thirty feet per side. In the center of the inner side of the chamber, a massive phoenix statue carved entirely from ruby shone with dazzling brilliance.\n\nYes, it was entirely a piece of crystal-clear ruby. The phoenix was in a pose of spreading its wings to soar. Its eyes were inlaid with two golden gems, and the fiery airflow emanated from this statue. Feng Nü did not appear in the stone chamber, which made Nian Bing feel uneasy. He couldn't help but call out loudly, \"Feng Nü, where are you? What place is this?\"\n\nSuddenly, a surge of intense heat came from the totem beneath Nian Bing's feet. Even Nian Bing's Heaven's Eye domain couldn't weaken this scorching aura, forcing him to retreat from the totem's area. A phantom figure lit up from the golden pattern. A holy thermal energy filled the entire stone chamber. This rising figure was Feng Nü, transformed into the phoenix. It took a good while for her to go from a phantom to a gradually solidifying form. When she finally fully appeared, Nian Bing breathed a sigh of relief. At this moment, the low voice from outside sounded again.\n\n\"Great Phoenix! You have finally returned. We have waited so long and so bitterly for this day. Alas, we, the subjects of the Lost Continent, can no longer escape the arrangement of fate. Perhaps, you have come too late.\"\n\nFeng Nü returned to her human form, gazing at the massive phoenix statue before her. Tears streamed down her face. From the low voice, she felt a genuine sadness.\n\nThe low voice continued, \"What you are hearing now is the memory we left behind before our final destruction. Although I am also about to die, I wish to leave behind my feelings. Only when your energy appears can my voice be heard. As the last king of the Lost Continent, I have failed. However, I am unwilling to admit my failure. I have done nothing wrong; the Lost Continent has always fought for itself. But in the end, I lost, defeated by fate. I know you did your best, but just as we were about to win, those terrifying existences appeared, and they caused us to leave our original world. I left a curse on the Radiant Continent. Although we lost with the participation of those terrifying beings, I feel that one day we will return, because we belong to our own world, and those terrifying beings do not. Moreover, we have found some information about them, and even some super weapons left from prehistoric times. Perhaps only those weapons can destroy them. Although the Lost Continent was teleported to another dimension, I do not regret it. For freedom, I am willing to pay any price, and so are my subjects. Did they think that by isolating us in another world, they could make us lose our faith? That is impossible. I firmly believe that Lord Phoenix has not died, and one day in the future, you will lead us back to our world, not only to gain freedom but also to destroy those terrifying beings. In front of my subjects, I swear in the name of Luther XVII, one day we will return, return to our world, and obtain everything we deserve.\"\n\nLuther XVII. Hearing these five words, Nian Bing's heart was greatly shaken. He finally knew who had left this dying message: it was the last emperor of the Lost Continent who presided over the decisive battle between the Lost Continent and the Divine Continent and achieved the final victory! Unfortunately, when faced with true gods whom they were powerless to resist, the Lost Continent was forcibly stripped from this world and sent into another dimension. The terrifying beings he spoke of were clearly those three true gods. Luther XVII's voice was so impassioned. Even though it was just his recorded voice, Nian Bing could still feel the strong fighting spirit within him.\n\nThe impassioned voice disappeared, and the stone chamber fell into a brief silence. After a while, a low and majestic voice let out a long sigh. Within this sigh were contained too many things: indignation, sadness, and deep unwillingness. \"Lord Phoenix, if everything had unfolded according to my predictions, then even if I died, my descendants would surely lead the armies of the Lost Continent to raze the Divine Continent, eliminate the enemies who restricted our freedom, and bring dawn back to the land. In the curse I left behind, there is a curse that draws human desire for power, which requires the Dark Saintess as a guide. The knights can be said to be my scheme. As long as we truly return, becoming the ruler of the Lost Continent would be a joke. The only ones who truly benefited from the curse were the Dark Saintess. But she could not become the ruler of the Lost Continent. Only the heir of my Luther family is the king of this continent. However, when I was full of confidence, I realized I had misjudged one thing: my assessment of those terrifying beings. Yes! How could they allow the existence of potential threats to them to appear in the future? When we were exiled to another dimension, and when I was confidently preparing to lead the subjects of the Lost Continent to develop again, they brought us disaster. They used their powerful destructive force to limit everything about us, change our environment, and destroy everything that could pose a threat to them, including our army and my subjects. Now, they are outside, constantly destroying. What they want to destroy is not the lives of all the subjects of the Lost Continent, but the civilization of the Lost Continent! They are constantly destroying with their abilities, changing the order of the Lost Continent. Just now, I was able to escape here under the protection of my subordinates. But I know they will not let me survive. The civilization of the Lost Continent has already been destroyed. All I can do now is leave a little hope for my subjects. I have modified the curse left on the Radiant Continent. If the Lost Continent can truly return to our original world, then let the Dark Saintess become the ruler of my remaining subjects. The terrifying beings will not leave us any civilization. I always thought I was very smart; I had ambition and means. But in the face of their true destructive power, I found myself so insignificant. Lord Phoenix, I don't know if you can hear the voice I left behind. But if you truly hear it, I, Luther XVII, have only one request: please treat my subjects kindly. Even if they have forgotten the existence of the Lost Empire due to the destruction of civilization, please treat them kindly. Those terrifying beings are not something we can contend with. I just hope that the former Lost Empire can have a bloodline continue to flow. Lord Phoenix, do not make futile sacrifices; it is useless. I must go. Even in death, I will walk out bravely. Lord Phoenix, you are the totem of the Lost Empire. Even if the Lost Empire is truly destroyed, this will never change. Farewell, our civilization.\"\n\nSadness, deep sadness filled the entire room. Everything around seemed to become a little unreal. At this moment, Nian Bing understood everything. The true reason for the destruction of the Lost Continent's civilization was not the environment of the other dimension, but the three true gods who had become the God of Destruction, the God of Order, and the God of Time. They only said they would expel the Lost Continent, but when they sent the Lost Continent into another dimension, claiming to be in cultivation while in slumber, they also came to the Lost Continent and destroyed everything that could threaten them. Not only did they destroy all prehistoric legacies, but they also destroyed the entire civilization of the Lost Continent! What a cruel method, what a scheme. Perhaps even Kao and Dark Tian Xiang did not know all the things they had secretly done. True gods are indeed true gods. No wonder they were not concerned about the opening of the Moodas seal; it turned out that everything had already been under their control. What else was there to care about? The return of the Lost Continent was merely an addition of a piece of land to this world, nothing more. The prehistoric civilization that could threaten them no longer existed, and the Lost Empire no longer existed.\n\nWith a light \"ding,\" Nian Bing was awakened from his grief and indignation. He was surprised to see a crack appear in the chest of the ruby phoenix statue before him. With a faint rustling sound, the crack gradually widened, and the golden eyes of the phoenix statue dimmed. Feng Nü had knelt down at some point. She stared blankly at the statue before her. As the cracks spread all over the phoenix statue, with a \"bang,\" the statue completely shattered. The ruby lost its dazzling brilliance. Luther XVII's voice was clearly stored within this statue. He was not only a great king but also a great magician. Such an ingenious design made even Nian Bing sigh in admiration. Unfortunately, the era of the Lost Empire had completely ended, and Luther XVII's wish was ultimately unfulfilled as he headed towards destruction.\n\nA heart-shaped gem caught Nian Bing's attention. After the statue was completely broken, only this gem remained suspended in the center of the statue's original position. The gem's light was peculiar; it flashed with two colors, one moment red, the next blue. It did not change the surrounding environment, but through his Heaven's Eye acupoint, Nian Bing clearly felt that this gem contained an immeasurable amount of energy. What is this? The question arose in his mind. Just then, the heart-shaped gem suddenly moved and floated gently to Feng Nü's front, landing in her hand.",

    "content": "\"What kind of terrifying existence is it?\" Feng Nu murmured, gazing at the gem in her hand. The sadness in her eyes wasn't entirely her own; it was also the profound sorrow carried by the phoenix bloodline. The Phoenix had left its bloodline to the Phoenix tribe and a portion of its memories to Feng Nu and Lan Chen. As the former totem of the Lost Continent, whose civilization had been utterly destroyed, the grief from the deepest part of the bloodline was unleashed without reservation, affecting Feng Nu's heart. The room's heat had completely vanished, and the golden totem on the ground no longer emitted light, yet Feng Nu continued to stare at the heart-shaped gem in her hand, repeating that single sentence. The gem in her hand gradually changed, no longer flashing blue light but emitting a pure red glow.\n\nNian Bing walked to Feng Nu's side and asked in a low voice, \"What is this?\" He had a vague feeling that this heart-shaped gem was closely related to the Phoenix and might even affect the entire Phoenix tribe.\n\nFeng Nu looked at Nian Bing and said, \"And what is that terrifying existence? Nian Bing, you've been to the Divine Continent. You must know, right? Tell me, who destroyed the civilization of the Lost Continent?\"\n\nNian Bing sighed and said, \"Yes, I know who. On the Divine Continent, there are four terrifying existences. It's not wrong to describe them as terrifying. Simple numbers can help you understand their power. From a magical perspective, once one reaches the rank of a twelfth-tier God-descendant, even a single level of advancement results in a qualitative leap. Those four terrifying existences are three of them who performed a seventeenth-tier spatial magic. These three individuals respectively hold the titles of God of Order, God of Destruction, and God of Time. If they hadn't intervened, the strength of those God Kings and Divine Beings on the Divine Continent would likely have led to complete defeat in the Divine Remnant War ten thousand years ago. I once met one of them, but I couldn't discern his true strength. However, I can be certain that Luther XVII was correct: if they were to participate in the conflicts between continents, it would only lead to destruction. Even if all of us combined, we couldn't contend with even one of them. But the civilization of the Lost Continent was destroyed by them. The only threat to them in this world is likely another True God. At that time, I was saved by this True God on the Divine Continent. I didn't tell you this because I didn't want to burden you with too much psychological pressure. However, for those True Gods, the conflicts on the continents no longer hold their interest. Therefore, I believe the impending war is entirely a war between us and the Divine Beings of the Divine Continent.\"\n\nFeng Nu looked at Nian Bing and sighed softly. \"An entire civilization was destroyed like this. Now, after hearing Luther XVII's dying words, the former civilization of the Lost Continent hasn't even left a single trace. Nian Bing, I'm truly a little scared.\" She didn't say what she was afraid of, but Nian Bing understood her feelings. He opened his arms and held Feng Nu tightly.\n\nFeeling the warmth from Nian Bing, Feng Nu's heart calmed considerably. She stroked the gem in her hand and whispered, \"Nian Bing, if our opponents are truly only those Divine Beings, I think our chances increase significantly. Do you know what this gem is? It's called the Heart of the Phoenix. When we were at Phoenix Volcano, Chenchen and I received our ancestor Phoenix's final teachings. He told us that if we could find the Heart of the Phoenix he had left on the Lost Continent, we might be able to reach the Ninth Transformation of the Phoenix in a short time, becoming true Phoenixes and possessing their true power.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Nian Bing's heart leaped. The power of the Phoenix represented the might of the fourteenth tier. If Feng Nu and Lan Chen could both reach the fourteenth tier, combined with his own strength, the war with the Divine Continent would indeed have much greater certainty. The original less than twenty percent chance could at least rise to forty percent. \"Feng Nu, then let's hurry back. The sooner you and Chenchen become stronger, the more advantageous it will be for us.\"\n\nFeng Nu nodded slightly. \"Ancestor Phoenix has truly departed. Now, Chenchen and I are his inheritors. The responsibility is no longer just yours and Youyou's; Chenchen and I also have a responsibility. For the sake of our ancestor and Luther XVII's last wishes, we must all protect this Lost Continent from further defilement.\"\n\nWhen Nian Bing and Feng Nu returned to the banks of Ice Moon Lake, the great river, constructed by Xi Lu and the mages, was completed. The thirty-zhang-wide river led directly to the encampment of the Hua Rong Empire. For several days, consecutive heavy rains had made the ice and water mages' work much easier. With the help of the rainfall, raising the river's water level was naturally easy. The first harvest of crops had also been completed. Nourished by water with life essence and the essence of nature, the harvest was excellent. A simple calculation showed it was enough to feed the troops stationed here. Another batch of support and supplies from the Four Great Empires had also arrived. The reclamation of the Lost Continent was proceeding very smoothly. Now, the second batch of seeds had already begun to sprout, and the planted area had doubled compared to when they first arrived.\n\nAs soon as they returned to Ice Moon Lake, Nian Bing immediately ordered people to summon Xi Lu and the leaders of the Four Great Empires to a meeting by the lake. Simultaneously, he mobilized the military forces belonging to the Ice Moon Empire to begin preparations.\n\nFeng Nu and Lan Chen did not participate in this meeting. The two women were currently in a quiet room, studying the effects of the Heart of the Phoenix. They both knew that the decisive factor in this war would be the strong individuals on both sides. Although there was only one stage difference between the Eighth and Ninth Transformations of the Phoenix, having witnessed the strength of the God Kings, they knew that this single stage represented a completely different level of power. To survive, and for the responsibilities they bore, they had to quickly uncover the secrets within the Heart of the Phoenix. Only then could they increase the possibility of victory in this war.\n\nThe leaders of the four nations no longer needed to live in tents. With the skill of the craftsmen, the stone houses built were much more comfortable than tents. In the largest stone house by Ice Moon Lake, Xue Po, the Grand Marshal of the Ice Moon Empire; Mu Jing, the Princess of the Lang Mu Empire; Luo Rou, the Prime Minister of the Ao Lan Empire; and Rong Yan, the Grand Marshal and Prince of the Hua Rong Empire, were all deep in thought, their brows furrowed. Only the highest commanders of the Four Great Empires in the Lost Continent could attend this meeting. They had just finished hearing Nian Bing's report on his recent journey. However, Nian Bing had concealed the situation of the ruins of the Lost Continent. To bolster the confidence of the Four Great Empires, he absolutely could not reveal the existence of True Gods, or it would undoubtedly cause immense panic.\n\nPrince Rong sighed and said, \"It seems we really need to take action. Nian Bing, we'll do as you say. I'll bring my people to rendezvous with you when I return. Let us fight a god-slaying battle. I want to see whose strength is greater, theirs or our magic. Nian Bing, I heard from Chenchen that you've rescued Rong Tian and your mother. Are they coming this time?\"\n\nNian Bing looked deeply at his grandfather and said, \"They should already be on their way. Grandfather, you...\" Everyone present knew his relationship with the Rong family, and there was nothing to hide.\n\nPrince Rong stood up and walked towards the outside. He paused when he opened the door, \"I am old now. My previous obsessions are all in the past. They gave me such an excellent grandson as you; what more could I ask for? The past is the past. No matter how they choose, let it be so.\" After saying this, Rong Yan opened the door and left, his back appearing a little more aged.\n\nNian Bing breathed a sigh of relief. He knew that although his father could be with his mother, his father still had a great regret in his heart. Unlike him, his father had absolute loyalty to the family, which Nian Bing lacked. His grandfather had finally accepted the fact that his parents were together. This time, his father could also be at ease.\n\nOnce Prince Rong left, the atmosphere in the room instantly became much more relaxed. Mu Jing said, \"Elder Brother, do you have any specific arrangements? How should we prepare?\"\n\nXue Po, hearing that Princess Mu Jing, who held a special status in the Lang Mu Empire, actually addressed Nian Bing as \"Elder Brother,\" was startled. He thought to himself, it seems I haven't fully grasped the Cult Leader's power yet! His respect for Nian Bing grew even more.\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"I have a general idea, but we must go there to begin the deployment. Jing'er, you don't need to bring your nature mages. In the war against the Divine Continent, their nature magic will not play a significant role. After all, there are no plants to manipulate there. It's better to let them stay here and continue reclaiming the Lost Continent.\"\n\nMu Jing nodded and said, \"Everything will be as Elder Brother arranges. Besides nature mages, we have quite a few mages from other schools. As for warriors at the level of Martial Saints, they have been practicing combined attacks with those from the Ao Lan Empire, and should be able to be of some use. As for logistics and supplies, you can rest assured. Not only have our planted crops yielded a good harvest, but I have also brought in a large amount of supplies from within the Lang Mu Empire, enough to sustain a short-term war. As for reserve supplies, they will be transported continuously. However, I am concerned about the transportation process, as we are quite a distance from there.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"You don't need to worry about that. While you are organizing your troops these two days, I will begin constructing a large-scale, long-distance spatial teleportation magic array and another magic array to accumulate spatial elements. With this composite magic array, reaching there from here will only take an instant.\"\n\nLuo Rou said, \"The mages of our Ao Lan Empire are also fully assembled. I brought the troops over when you went to see those refugees. A batch of supplies is also being transported from the country, and it should arrive within ten days. Nian Bing, I will give you a surprise this time. However, thanks to the help of your Ice Moon Empire, it was possible to complete it.\"\n\nNian Bing was surprised and said, \"A surprise? What surprise?\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled mysteriously and said, \"You'll know when we get there. Actually, you have a large part to play in this surprise. I only came up with it after researching with our national court mages. It's just that we don't know what level this surprise can achieve yet.\"\n\nNodding, Nian Bing smiled slightly. \"Alright then, I'll await your surprise. We must be ready within three days and then set off for the refugees. The sooner we deploy, the more advantageous it will be for us. You all need to get busy. One thing you must remember: mages are our key; you must protect them well.\"\n\nLuo Rou and Mu Jing stood up. Mu Jing said, \"Elder Brother, then we will go back and prepare. As soon as the Hua Rong Empire's army arrives, we will depart immediately.\" The two women took their leave.\n\nAt this point, only Nian Bing and Xue Po remained in the room. Xue Po asked, \"Cult Leader, do you have any further instructions?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Elder Xue Po, you will lead the Ice Moon Empire's contingent in this operation. The elite forces of our sect and all the mages will be under my command. You heard what I told them just now. Once the war begins, we must protect the mages at all costs. Based on my understanding of the Divine Beings, although their strength is formidable, they are all martial artists. Long-range attacks are our advantage.\"\n\nXue Po nodded and said, \"I understand what you mean. I will go and make arrangements now. For the sake of ultimate victory, sacrifice is inevitable.\"\n\nXue Po also left. Nian Bing stood in the stone house and pondered for a moment before stepping out. The fresh air, brought by the Ice Moon Lake, had a slightly moist feel. Fully appreciating this comfort, and looking at the lush green crops by the lakeside, Nian Bing's heart calmed a little. It had been several years since he left Peach Blossom Forest. The world had changed so quickly. When he left Peach Blossom Forest, he had only two goals: avenging his parents and pursuing the pinnacle of culinary skills. In these past few years, driven by fate, his original intentions had been constantly shifting. He hadn't even been able to participate in the much-anticipated Culinary God competition. As expected, Xiao Tian, with his Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand, had become the new Culinary God. As for himself? He was fighting for survival. The progress in his own strength could be described as rapid, but he always felt a sense of inadequacy. Above him, there were so many powerful individuals he couldn't contend with. And his culinary skills? Although he hadn't neglected them, he also didn't have the time to seek their true meaning.",

    "content": "Upon thinking this, Nian Bing couldn't help but let out a long sigh. A silver light flashed in his hand, and a small vase appeared out of thin air. Opening the stopper, a rich, pure fragrance wafted out, refreshing and deeply comforting. He carefully poured a single drop of the liquid into his mouth. Instantly, an ineffable aroma filled his entire body, and a gentle warmth spread within him. The feeling of vitality immediately eased Nian Bing's dejected heart. Yes, this was the Hundred Flower Dew, refined within the Life Domain of Kao. The Hundred Flower Dew had truly consumed a lot of his mental effort. If only Master were still alive. How happy he would be to taste the Hundred Flower Dew he refined, he wondered. What is the true essence of culinary arts? What exactly is it? He still didn't know. Xiao Tian's culinary skills must have been steadily improving, but what about himself? His culinary skills had at most only strengthened his control over magic. Although at his current level, practice was no longer as important, there was still a need for time for contemplation and innovation. Unfortunately, driven by fate, he could be said to have propelled freedom forward. How difficult it was to reach the pinnacle of culinary arts! There were still about three years until the next Chef God competition. If the war with the Continent of Gods could be won smoothly, perhaps he would still have a chance. Only with thorough consideration could he possibly elevate his culinary realm! Master, are you perhaps disappointed in me in heaven? I'm sorry, I don't want this, but there are things I must do. If the Yangguang Continent cannot even guarantee peace, then no matter how strong my culinary skills are, where can they be displayed? Master! I really miss you. Watch me. As soon as this matter is over, I will dedicate myself wholeheartedly to the cultivation of culinary arts, and I will never disappoint you again.\n\nThe gentle breeze blew, carrying the damp air with a faint aroma of soil into Nian Bing's nostrils. The fragrance of the Hundred Flower Dew in his mouth lingered. Thinking of Master, Nian Bing naturally also thought of the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice. How ridiculous, truly ridiculous! He never imagined that she would be Master's lover, and his mother's senior disciple. Twisted hatred had blinded her eyes. Was Master at fault? No. Master was not at fault. In the culinary competition with the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's father, Master's pursuit was naturally to win. Moreover, given Master's character, it was impossible for him to humiliate his opponent. There were only two possibilities: one, that the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice's father was too stubborn; and two, that the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice misunderstood her father's intentions. Their love could be described as tragic. Not just Master's tragedy, but also the tragedy of the Ice Snow Goddess Sacrifice, Bing Jie. In fact, Master had never truly blamed her. However, she could not forgive herself. He wondered how she was now. It was a pity that she awakened too late, too late. Master was already gone. Even if she regretted it, where could she find him? Heavens! Was their relationship destined to be a tragedy?\n\n\"Nian Bing.\" A deep voice startled Nian Bing from his thoughts. Turning around, he saw Xi Lu standing not far behind him with a somber expression. He had no idea when Xi Lu had arrived. From Xi Lu's complex gaze, Nian Bing could tell that his mood was unstable at the moment.\n\n\"Brother Xi Lu, if you weren't coming to find me, I would have come to find you. Let's go to my room to talk.\" With that, Nian Bing walked to Xi Lu's side, patted his shoulder, and led him toward his room. Now, Xi Lu no longer needed to conceal his true appearance with the Longevity Blade. The prestige of the God of War, Xi Lu, was no less than that of Prince Rong among the armies of the four empires on the Lost Continent. Most people in the army might not even know that Nian Bing existed, but absolutely no one didn't know the God of War. In the past three months, Xi Lu had conquered the hearts of all soldiers with his formidable strength. Wherever the God of War went, generals and soldiers from any country would pay their most reverent respects. Warriors always admired the strong.\n\nNian Bing's room was not large. Apart from a spacious bed, there was not much else that could fit into the ten-odd square meters stone room. As soon as they entered, Nian Bing saw Long Ling's smile. Feng Nu and Lan Chen had gone to cultivate, and Long Ling had voluntarily taken on the responsibility of taking care of Nian Bing's food and daily life. Seeing him push the door open, she quickly went to greet him and said with a smile, \"You're back. Brother Xi Lu is here too. Come in and sit down.\"\n\nNian Bing and Xi Lu walked into the room and sat down. Long Ling poured them two cups of water. While pouring the water, she noticed Xi Lu's slightly unusual expression and said with a smile, \"You guys chat. I'll go take a look.\" As a virtuous wife, she naturally wouldn't stay when the men needed to talk.\n\nWatching Long Ling's retreating back, Xi Lu let out a soft sigh and said, \"Nian Bing, you have a good wife.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"No, I have three good wives. They are all my beloved. Brother Xi Lu, I know what you want to ask. I hope you can remain calm after hearing my words.\"\n\nXi Lu looked deeply at Nian Bing and said, \"When I first returned to this place where our ancestors lived, I had already prepared for the worst. Brother, do you know what my mood was when I first saw the desolation here? The efforts of our great dwarf ancestors did not receive the reward they deserved! Although I was not born and raised here, I have a deep affection for this land. That is why I helped them reclaim this desolate continent with all my might. Brother, thank you. If it weren't for your connection, this place would probably still be a wasteland.\"\n\nGratitude flowed from Xi Lu's eyes. He was thanking Nian Bing from the bottom of his heart. Watching the lake form and seeing the large areas of cultivated plants around them, his disappointment upon arriving gradually disappeared.\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"Brother, we are brothers. What else is there to say about thanks? I am also very happy to see the gradual changes here. Perhaps, in the near future, when the Lost Continent is fully reclaimed, the four empires will fight over territory. This is the inherent flaw of humanity, but after all, the Lost Continent will also regain its vitality at that time. This time, we met those refugees. They no longer have any memory of their ancestors, only struggling for survival. Among them are humans, elves, and your dwarves.\"\n\nXi Lu's body trembled slightly, \"No memory? Nian Bing, can you explain it more clearly?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"They have no memory, and at the same time, the Lost Continent has lost its own civilization...\" Then, he recounted to Xi Lu what he had seen and heard during his trip, including the ruins discovered in the ruins and what Luther XVII had said, believing it to be true. He spoke very carefully, without any omission, and as he spoke, he watched Xi Lu's changing expression.\n\nBy the time Nian Bing finished speaking, Xi Lu's aura had become extremely unstable, and his face was as dark as if it could drip water. He suddenly raised his hand, as if to slam it on the nearby table, but when his hand fell, he finally restrained his fighting spirit and said dejectedly, \"Bastards, those three bastards. They actually destroyed a civilization, a civilization!\"\n\nNian Bing stood up and walked to Xi Lu's side, tightly grasping his broad shoulders. He said, \"Brother, if I were one of those three True Gods, perhaps I would do the same, because it would be to protect my status. In this world, there is no absolute right or wrong. Whoever has the stronger fist, everything they do is right. The immediate priority now is to deal with the crisis brought by the Continent of Gods, and to protect your last remaining people from further harm. As for those three True Gods, they are something we cannot touch, Brother, do you understand what I mean?\"\n\nXi Lu looked deeply at Nian Bing and said, \"I understand, of course I understand. Even if we were all put together, we wouldn't be a match for those three bastards. But I'm not reconciled! Our Lost Continent's civilization just disappeared like this, how can I be reconciled?\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes flashed with brilliance. He suddenly pulled Xi Lu up from his seat and said sternly, \"Xi Lu, listen to me clearly. Have you forgotten why Senior Xi Rong and your mother died? They died to fulfill you and me. What's the use of your not being reconciled now? Do you think you are inferior to your ancestors? Since your ancestors were all heroes, then you can also become a hero. A hero of the dwarves. The previous civilization was destroyed, but why can't you lead your people to establish a new civilization? There is no use in indulging in pain and hatred. You must strive for your people, for the civilization of the dwarves, and even for the civilization of the Lost Continent. The dwarves still have you. The things that the dwarves once possessed have been forgotten by your people on the Lost Continent, but you have not forgotten them. You can pass on what you have to them. Can't the dwarves become strong again? At that time, you will be the hero who reopened the dwarf civilization. The greatest hero in the history of the dwarves. For your people, you must pull yourself together. Revenge is important, but inheritance is even more important. Otherwise, if you die in revenge, will you be worthy of your mother's sacrifice for you? Will you be worthy of your people? At that time, the civilization of the dwarves will truly be extinguished!\"\n\nListening to Nian Bing's words, a glimmer gradually appeared in Xi Lu's eyes. Yes! What he needed now was to pass on the wisdom and knowledge of the dwarves, not to fall into despair. Nian Bing's stern scolding awakened Xi Lu's intelligence. Looking into Nian Bing's eyes, he gradually came up with his own plan. He pushed away Nian Bing's hand and said, \"Nian Bing, I'm leaving.\"\n\nNian Bing did not stop him. Watching the sturdy Xi Lu leave his room with firm steps, a faint smile appeared on his face. Xi Lu had understood. He possessed the unique wisdom of the dwarves, and without a doubt, he had already begun to strive to become the King of the Dwarves. Striving to pass on all aspects of the dwarves. It was a pity that only the dwarf lineage had survived on the Lost Continent, while the elves and the humans of the Lost Continent were not so fortunate. It seemed that the history of the Lost Continent would not be recreated. Only by bringing the civilization of the Yangguang Continent here could this continent regain its vitality. And all of this depended on the victory in the war with the Continent of Gods, otherwise, all efforts would be in vain!\n\nLong Ling walked in from outside, holding a plate with a few red fruits on it. She walked in front of Nian Bing and placed the fruit aside. Standing on her tiptoes, she used her hand to tidy Nian Bing's slightly messy hair and said with a smile, \"Bing, don't think too much. When the cart reaches the mountain, there will be a road. You must take care of yourself.\"\n\nListening to Long Ling's gentle words, Nian Bing's heart immediately warmed. He walked to a chair and sat down. He pulled her to sit on his lap, embraced her soft, delicate body, and said in a low voice, \"Ling'er, I've been too busy lately, and I've inevitably neglected you. Don't blame me, okay?\"\n\nLong Ling smiled slightly and said, \"Silly boy, how could I blame you? You have your own things to do. However, last time you left us all behind and went to deal with the crisis when the Moaudas seal was opened, I was really angry. Feng Nu and Chen Chen were also very unhappy. Although we haven't officially married, we can be considered your wives. When facing difficulties, how could you abandon us? Nian Bing, no matter what, don't let there be a next time, okay?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Don't worry, I promise I won't abandon you again. Whether in life or death, we will be together. Ling'er, there are still three days until we leave. I want to use these three days to cultivate some of the abilities I've comprehended recently. Don't let anyone disturb me. Although the time is short, I think it will still have some effect.\"\n\nLong Ling smiled gently and got off Nian Bing's lap. \"Don't worry, just cultivate. Unless it's something particularly important, I will never let anyone disturb you. Have some fruit. These were the first we planted on the Lost Continent. The nature magic of those nature mages is truly peculiar. Fruit trees that take years to mature have borne fruit so quickly under the effect of their magic. No wonder the Langmu Empire is known as the granary of the Yangguang Continent. Alright, I'm leaving. If you need anything, just call me. My room is right next to yours.\"",

    "content": "\"Oh, right, I have some good news for you. After cultivating during this period, my Xi Jing acupoint seems to show signs of opening. Once I gain the ability to utilize innate energy, I should be able to reach the twelfth level too,\" she said, quickly kissing Nian Bing on the cheek before running out. At the doorway, she deliberately closed the door for Nian Bing.\n\nPicking up a piece of fruit and putting it in her mouth, the sweet juice stimulated Nian Bing's taste buds. Feeling the warmth on his face, Nian Bing suddenly realized that his choice was truly correct. If he had rejected Long Ling's feelings back then, perhaps this gentle girl would never have been as happy as she was now.\n\nDivine Continent.\n\nXi Jie stood respectfully in the canyon between two mountain peaks, watching the distorted air ahead, not even daring to breathe too loudly. He had been standing there for three days. He had come here after receiving news from the gods who had returned from the Lost Continent.\n\nAt this time, various magical elements in the air were in a frenzy. It was time for a magical storm again. However, these magical storms could not affect Xi Jie at all. The invasion of magical elements would be dispelled by an invisible energy when they reached within a ten-foot radius of his body. For ordinary gods, magical storms might be a disaster, but for Tai, who stood at the pinnacle of gods, magical storms were not even an itch.\n\nAfter waiting here for three days, Xi Jie felt no anxiety. In the long ages, time had long since ceased to be important to him. Let alone three days, he could wait motionlessly even if he stood here for three years. It had been a long time since anything had made him ponder, but this time, he had to think carefully, because he did not want to miss anything or let go of any opportunity. After Xia Yu returned that day, he had dispatched hundreds of gods to the Lost Continent, covering nearly two-thirds of its territory, and the news they brought back was all the same. Only one team of gods had discovered the existence of the inhabitants of the Lost Continent. But those inhabitants were so weak that he found it laughable. He had already been one of the strongest principal gods on the Divine Continent during the God-Lost War. At that time, the fierce fighting style of the inhabitants of the Lost Continent had left a deep impression on him. Therefore, when he heard that the seal of Mo Oudas was still broken despite the dispatch of so many experts, he felt a trace of fear besides anger. However, the news he had now received completely dispelled this trace of fear. The threat from the Lost Continent no longer existed. The remaining tens of thousands of inhabitants were a joke to him; even if he were alone, he could utterly destroy them. But now, his heart, which had been dormant for many years, had come alive again. The Divine Continent was indeed a very suitable place for cultivation, but after tens of thousands of years, the monotony had made it unbearable for him. He no longer just wanted to occupy the Lost Continent; that barren land held little attraction for him. However, the news about the Bright Continent obtained from Xia Yu made even a godly expert like him unable to resist being tempted. Yes! He possessed strength second only to true gods, so why should he continue to live a lonely life in this place? Why couldn't he make life more colorful? Leading his subordinates to occupy that prosperous continent would not be difficult, right? As long as he obtained the permission of the three true gods, the entire world would be under his control. He was a god, a great Heavenly God. Those weak humans could only become slaves of the gods. What could tens of millions of slaves bring him? What could excite him on the Bright Continent? Before arriving in this canyon, Xi Jie's heart had already become ardent. His heart, which had been dormant due to arduous cultivation, seemed to be burning. He needed to release it.\n\nAlthough Xi Jie was already eager to end his seclusion on the Divine Continent, he did not do so. As the strongest among the gods, he knew very well what to do and when to do it. He could not bury his bright future because of a moment's impulse. The patience accumulated over more than ten thousand years had already made him incapable of making mistakes due to impulse, so he came here.\n\n\"Have you been waiting here for a long time?\" a somewhat strange voice sounded. It was difficult to tell from this voice whether it was male or female. Although the voice was soft, it sounded much more terrifying to Xi Jie than the surrounding magical storms. He quickly stepped forward and knelt on one knee, saying, \"No, I haven't been here long. Waiting is a glory bestowed upon me by the gods.\"\n\nThe strange voice said indifferently, \"We already know your purpose for coming. On this continent, nothing can escape our grasp. Order has instructed me to tell you that you can do as you please. We will not stop you. However, you must understand one thing. If you destroy everything in this world, then all places will become a hell like the Divine Continent. By then, even if you are gods, with the continuous change of environment, you can only move towards extinction. Regarding the mastery of proportion, with your age and ability, you should understand it very well.\"\n\nXi Jie was stunned. He couldn't quite understand the meaning of the voice's owner and asked tentatively, \"Then what should I do? Since we cannot destroy, then we...\"\n\nThe strange voice said, \"I will give you two words: Order. As long as you let the places you wish to go develop according to your needs for order, you will become the master there. Killing cannot solve everything. In our previous world, there were many profound great people, among whom was a saying called 'winning hearts with virtue.' Only by capturing the hearts of humans and instilling your order in them can you truly become their god. As for how to do it, that will depend on you to figure out. Starting from now, the affairs of you gods are unrelated to us. We will no longer interfere with you. Although gods can be said to be created by us, and even this place most suitable for human cultivation, all its environments are due to us, we are no longer interested in you now. However, this is our homeland. Even if tens of thousands of years have passed, and even if we may leave this place in the near future, we do not wish for it to be completely destroyed.\"\n\nXi Jie was somewhat surprised and said, \"Are the true gods leaving? Is it the exploration of unknown worlds that the God of Time mentioned before?\"\n\nThe God of Time said calmly, \"Haven't you been waiting for this day for a long time? Once we leave this world, you will become the true master of this world.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Xi Jie immediately said fearfully, \"No, how could I have such an idea? Without the true gods, I would not be here today. I am reluctant for the true gods to leave!\"\n\nThe God of Time's tone still had no emotional fluctuations. \"You don't need to hide your ambitions from me. It's meaningless, and we don't care about these things.\"\n\n\"But. But if the true gods leave, then, then what about the True God Ka'ao...\" Xi Jie said with some worry.\n\n\"This is your real concern, isn't it? Yes, even if you become stronger, you cannot contend with Ka'ao. Even the three of us have taken so many years to be able to fully contend with them. You don't need to consider these things. When we leave, it will also be the day we settle accounts with Ka'ao. In our hearts, if we cannot resolve their issues, how can we possibly leave? You can rest assured and go. Ka'ao will not bring you trouble. It will not be long before our final settlement. The five-thousand-year struggle should have a conclusion.\"\n\nXi Jie was overjoyed, but his expression remained unchanged. He bowed respectfully, \"Then I shall take my leave. May the true gods take care. If there is anything you need me to do, please do not hesitate to instruct me.\" After saying this, he slowly stood up and backed out of the canyon. Only after completely leaving the canyon did he float up and disappear in an instant.\n\nXi Jie left, and three figures slowly emerged from the distorted air. A rough voice said, \"Time, do you think this fellow will do as we said?\"\n\nThe God of Time smiled indifferently and said, \"He will. Do you think everyone is like you, only knowing destruction? Xi Jie is a smart person. Otherwise, we wouldn't have chosen him to be the god leader back then. Smart people do not do foolish things, unless his strength can surpass the three of us. Otherwise, he will never do anything that displeases us. These gods have been dormant under our restraint for ten thousand years, and it is time for them to explode. Poor Bright Continent! If we were not about to leave this place, I would truly be a little reluctant to see it deviate from its original orbit.\"\n\nA lazy voice sounded, \"Time, do not underestimate this Xi Jie. He has been trying hard to break through the Tian Yan acupoint. The human body is very miraculous. If he truly opens all seven acupoints and cultivates for a long time, he might be able to reach our realm. When we are done with Ka'ao and Tian Xiang, this person cannot be kept.\"\n\nThe God of Time chuckled, \"Order, although you are the most powerful among us, your desire for conflict is no less than destruction. Do you think Xi Jie becoming stronger can have any impact on us? Even in the best-case scenario, he can at most contend with one of us. Now, what we need is a rich and colorful life. I am increasingly looking forward to leaving this world and experiencing wonderful feelings in new worlds. The struggle here has no meaning to me anymore. We are gods, not humans, so your heart should be more open. In fact, I did not agree with your handling of the Lost Continent back then. You completely destroyed that civilization, causing many wonderful things to disappear with it. So what if the Lost Continent developed for ten thousand years? Could it truly compare to us? No, they couldn't. Can the technology of our era be thoroughly studied by people of the present? Many things, once truly lost, can never return.\"\n\nThe God of Order said coldly, \"What do you know? I call this caution. Any matter that could pose a threat to us must be avoided. Whether it was the Lost Continent back then or the white people on the Bright Continent.\"\n\n\"Don't you know how strong the principal gods on the Divine Continent are? This time, two principal gods went to the Bright Continent but were unable to stop the opening of Mo Oudas's seal. A principal god was killed by a human, and with mental power at that. What does this represent? Mental power capable of killing a principal god, if it becomes even stronger, is enough to pose a threat to us. If I am not mistaken, that human must be the young man I saw with Ka'ao last time. Are you still blaming me for being cautious? If that young man becomes as powerful as us, and joins forces with Ka'ao and Tian Xiang, then our previously certain victory will cease to exist. Ka'ao and Tian Xiang, like us, have survived from the previous world until now. How could they not have plans? This time, when Xi Jie and the others went to the Lost Continent, I first wanted him to kill that young man, and then we would challenge Ka'ao and Tian Xiang, so that they would have no opportunity.\"\n\nThe God of Time frowned and said, \"This is possible. However, do you think it is easy for a human's mental power to reach our level? Moreover, with your and my strength, we can completely prevent his mental power from exerting its full power. If his comprehensive strength does not reach our level, then for Ka'ao and Tian Xiang, that human will only be a burden. Therefore, I don't think we need to worry. Order; when we were first created, you were half a level higher than us, and at that time, you should have been able to contend with either Ka'ao or Tian Xiang. But do you know why you have always remained at our level? It is because your heart is too small and cannot accommodate anything. If we were not already strong enough now, then there would be too many things in the world that could threaten us. Do you want to destroy them all? Instead of focusing your mind on this, it would be better to think of ways to improve your own strength. Originally, we were inferior to the God of Emotion, but can we not reach the level of the God of Emotion through cultivation? Striving to improve oneself must start from the mind. You, you are still too obsessed.\"",

    "content": "\"Actually, the gods we boast of are not gods in the true sense. When we were created, the technological father who created us once said that when the God of Emotions truly appeared, and when the power of the eighteenth order manifested, he would become the master of the entire world, the true god. Therefore, only the God of Emotions is a true god. As for us, the difference between us and those divine beings is only the difference in the level of strength. We have simply given ourselves a pleasant-sounding name.\"\n\nThe God of Order said with some displeasure, \"Time, what's wrong with you today? I feel like your emotions are a bit off. You usually don't have so many opinions or so many sentiments.\" Among the three true gods, the God of Order had always been the one who called the shots. The God of Destruction sometimes offered his own opinions, but the God of Time rarely spoke, dedicating most of his time to cultivation. Yet today, as the God of Order was preparing to communicate with the Xi Realm, the God of Time had proactively offered to speak with the Xi Realm. According to the God of Order's original intention, what happened to the Yangguang Continent was not important to them. Since they were about to leave this world, what did it matter what the Yangguang Continent became? However, the God of Time had said those words to the Xi Realm earlier, and now, he was clarifying his own viewpoint, clearly expressing dissatisfaction with the God of Order. This situation had never happened in tens of thousands of years. As someone who had always considered himself a god, the words of the God of Time were particularly jarring. However, they had lived together for tens of thousands of years, relying on each other. Despite his displeasure, he would not truly become angry with the God of Time.\n\nThe God of Time sighed and said, \"I don't know why, but you all know that I control the power of time. I always have a faint premonition about future times. Just yesterday, while cultivating, I sensed some situations that might occur in the future. Order, we are brothers. To be frank, this premonition is not very good. Perhaps some things we haven't considered might happen. If that's the case, perhaps our plan to challenge Kao and Tianxiang in advance should be postponed.\"\n\nThe God of Order was startled. He knew that the God of Time's premonitions had always been very accurate. Although they were only vague premonitions, they had played crucial roles for the three of them multiple times. This was also one of the reasons why the God of Order respected the God of Time. The time they had originally set was to issue one last challenge to Kao and Tianxiang a year later, but now, hearing what the God of Time said, even the God of Order felt a bit uneasy. He frowned and said, \"You mean, Kao and Tianxiang might merge the power of the God of Emotions in the near future? How is that possible? Fifty thousand years have passed. Although their strength has also been increasing, to say they can comprehend the true meaning of the God of Emotions is a bit too exaggerated. You also know that it's not something that can be achieved simply by increasing strength; it requires instantaneous enlightenment. And at our level, how easy is it to achieve sudden enlightenment? Even if another fifty thousand years pass, they probably won't comprehend anything. The God of Emotions is, after all, only a half-finished product.\"\n\nThe God of Time glanced at the God of Order and asked, \"Do you remember how the technological father who created us died?\"\n\nThe God of Order nodded and said, \"Of course, I remember. Although many years have passed, I can never forget the scene at that time. The technological father who created us died while laughing. Even after his death, I could still feel that excited aura emanating from him.\"\n\nThe God of Time looked at the God of Order and said, \"Then think carefully about what happened at that time. You should still remember that when the technological father first looked at us after creating us, his eyes were filled with disappointment. This was because he knew that the three high-level ability users he had painstakingly created still lost to the God of Emotions created by his old rival, the evolutionary father. At that time, he declared that he had lost. Because his mental energy was exhausted, he was already at the end of his life. What kept him barely alive was a belief in his heart. He wanted to see what the God of Emotions created by the evolutionary father was like. Later, he saw it, and he also witnessed the powerful strength of Kao and Tianxiang and their switching process. At that moment, he laughed heartily and died. What was the last thing he said before he integrated everything? Think about it. In my premonition yesterday, I clearly heard this sentence again, but the voice in my premonition was no longer excited but filled with sorrow.\"\n\nThe God of Order was stunned and was about to speak when the God of Destruction, standing beside him, interjected, \"When the technological father died, he said while laughing, 'I was wrong, I was wrong, I was actually wrong. I was wrong about such a small detail. This determined that the God of Emotions he created would forever be a half-finished product. Hahahaha, so, he and I were at the same stage. How laughable! How laughable. I never expected that he would be wrong by such a small margin when he was on the verge of victory. It was this little thing that caused his defeat. I haven't lost, I haven't lost! Hahahaha!'\"\n\nSilence. After the God of Destruction repeated the words that were deeply etched in their memories, the three true gods fell into a profound silence. After a long while, the God of Time spoke again, \"This is what I foresaw. However, in my premonition, not only did the tone of this sentence change, but a few words also changed, the last few words. The technological father originally said, 'I haven't lost,' which became 'I have lost.' Although it's only a change of three words, what does it bring us? Think about it, under what circumstances would the technological father say this? The evolutionary father of humanity died after researching the God of Emotions. According to what Kao said during our battles, the evolutionary father of humanity died with his eyes wide open. At that time, he seemed to want to say something to Kao and Tianxiang, but in the end, because he had overdrawn his life force, he couldn't say it. I think, whether it was the father of human modification or the technological father who created us, they both knew what the problem with the God of Emotions was. Therefore, although the technological father said at the end that the God of Emotions would forever be a half-finished product, I believe that under certain specific circumstances, the true God of Emotions could appear. You are all well aware of my precognitive abilities. This premonition is clearer than any previous one, which shows how much it affects us. My premonitions usually manifest within one to three years. This time frame is what I have calculated through constant deduction. In other words, within the next one to three years, the true God of Emotions is very likely to appear. As for why he can appear, and how Kao and Tianxiang can comprehend it, these are all unknowns to us. Unknowns are always the most terrifying things. You all understand this principle. Therefore, if we still want to win, if we still want to live our own lives in the future, then we must challenge them within one year. Only in this way can we have a chance of victory.\"\n\nThe God of Order said with some concern, \"I do not doubt your premonition. However, as you know, the shortest estimated time for us to cultivate our three-in-one combined skill is one year. Only by perfecting this skill can we have the confidence to destroy Kao and Tianxiang without being destroyed ourselves.\" The longer they lived, the more they cherished life. As early as ten thousand years ago, the combined strength of the three of them had surpassed Kao and Tianxiang. However, Kao and Tianxiang possessed the power to perish together at the critical moment. Therefore, despite winning every decisive battle, they had always been unable to deliver a fatal blow to Kao and Tianxiang. Although over the past ten thousand years, their confidence had grown stronger, gradually widening the gap with Kao and Tianxiang, even now, their most optimistic estimate of their own strength was that they would lose two of them while destroying Kao and Tianxiang. Such a price was unbearable for them. Through unremitting efforts, they had developed a special method to link the lives and all abilities of the three of them into one. Once successful, they would have the confidence to only injure, not kill, Kao and Tianxiang while dividing the damage equally among the three of them.\n\nThe God of Time looked at the God of Order and the God of Destruction and said, \"Therefore, our current direction of effort is to perfect the three-in-one skill within one year and then immediately challenge Kao and Tianxiang. In recent days, I have had some special insights. Success within a year may not be impossible. Order, it is precisely because of this that I emphasize the change in your state of mind. In the three-in-one combined attack technique, you are the key to the connection. Your abilities are the most important. If your state of mind can change, it will be of great help to us. I don't talk much, you all know this. I've said so much today because I've felt some fear about the uncertainty of our future destiny. Listen to me, Order, you need to change.\"\n\nThe God of Order looked at the God of Time. Only now did he completely understand that everything the God of Time had said today was for him, and also for their group of three. He nodded and said, \"They say it's easier to change mountains and rivers than a person's nature. I can only say I'll try my best. I'll try my best for our future. Time, perhaps you are right, but why didn't you tell me this earlier?\"\n\nThe God of Time said with a wry smile, \"Tell you earlier? Would you have listened? The arrogant mindset of those divine beings is probably learned mostly from you. If it weren't for the special conditions today, you wouldn't have been able to take my words to heart. It's not too late to change now; we still have a last chance. I wonder what Kao and Tianxiang are doing. Perhaps they also have premonitions.\"\n\n...\n\nDivine Continent, Life Domain.\n\nKao floated above the Lake of Life, looking at the verdant water beneath her feet, contemplating quietly. The life aura of the Life Domain was still as abundant as ever. Not far away, on the shore, various plants were growing luxuriantly.\n\nA trace of confusion flickered in Kao's deep, beautiful eyes, as if she couldn't make up her mind about something. Even the life aura surrounding her body showed a slight unstable fluctuation. This was a rare occurrence for her.\n\nA faint green light emanated from Kao's left hand, and a small bottle appeared out of thin air. She opened the cap and took a deep whiff of the fragrant aroma emanating from the bottle. A faint smile appeared on Kao's exquisitely beautiful and flawless face. The rich fragrance smelled so comforting; it was the Hundred Flower Dew brewed by Nian Bing for her.\n\nSince she had the Hundred Flower Dew, Kao's life had changed a bit. Her habit of eating flowers disappeared. It wasn't because she didn't want to spoil the beauty of the flowers, but because after having the Hundred Flower Dew, she had lost all interest in eating flowers. The taste of the Hundred Flower Dew had become her sole delight. When Nian Bing was making the Hundred Flower Dew initially, she had also tried to learn, but the process was not only extremely complicated but also required extremely strict control over the brewing time and heat. Even Nian Bing had spent countless efforts to successfully brew it. Kao had tried brewing it according to Nian Bing's method, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't produce the same taste as Nian Bing, which made Kao very frustrated. Therefore, she was now reluctant to drink this Hundred Flower Dew anymore. She kept the remaining Hundred Flower Dew as her most precious possession, only smelling it every day. Under the maintenance of her immense life force, she didn't have to worry about the Hundred Flower Dew evaporating.\n\nAs she contentedly savored the aroma of the Hundred Flower Dew, Kao's mind conjured the image of Nian Bing cooking for her for the first time. She remembered that the dish Nian Bing made then was called Ice and Fire Glazed Beads, and it tasted extremely delicious. Later, during the time Nian Bing stayed there, she could taste some delicious dishes every day. Although Nian Bing's supplies were limited, and later he could only eat simple things, Kao found that those days were the happiest of her fifty thousand years of existence. Every time she saw Nian Bing concentrating on brewing the Hundred Flower Dew or cooking, her heart would feel an inexplicable sense of satisfaction. Nian Bing had not been gone for long, but Kao felt a strange feeling. She didn't know that this feeling was called \"missing\" in the human world.\n\nThinking of Nian Bing inevitably brought to mind what happened between them in the lake that time. Although it hadn't been long, the wonderful feeling at that time filled Kao's heart with nostalgia. It was precisely because of that memory that her longing for Nian Bing became even deeper. However, she was now a little afraid, because when she first met Nian Bing, she already had her own plans, plans for survival. This meant that she could only use Nian Bing.",

    "content": "Tianxiang smiled faintly and said, \"Why not? In fact, like you, I often think of him. It seems he has really left a deep impression on us! He's done quite a lot in the days since he returned to the Yangguang Continent. However, he's about to be in trouble. The gods on the Divine Continent have already made their move. It seems those three fellows from Order have decided not to restrain these gods anymore. Should we intervene in such matters?\"\n\nKao shook his head and said, \"You knew long ago that we couldn't intervene, so why are you saying this to me? Tianxiang, we are one, although we have different souls and different energies. But we share one body. My feelings are your feelings. In the beginning, I would get angry when you used him to tease me, but I don't anymore. Because everything I've experienced, you have experienced too. I admit, I miss the time I spent with him, and I miss the feelings he brought me. But don't you miss it too? You tease me only to hide your own timidity. In fact, your heart has been shaken, hasn't it?\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Tianxiang said, somewhat angered. At this moment, her voice no longer carried that seductive charm. \"How could I be shaken? Don't you forget, this is related to our life and death. In this world, three-legged toads are rare, but men with two legs are everywhere. After we deal with those three fellows, with our looks, what kind of men can't we find?\"\n\nKao smiled slightly and said, \"Don't deceive yourself. Our thoughts are actually similar, but our resolve hasn't changed either. So, you don't need to hide anything from me. I won't hide anything either. Perhaps, he can only become a memory for us. Tianxiang! You should have sensed Xi Jie going to find those three fellows. On this Divine Continent, except for the place of those three fellows, there's nothing that can escape our perception. What do you think those three fellows will say to Xi Jie?\"\n\nTianxiang remained silent for a moment before saying, \"I can't guess that. However, I can be sure that the time for those three fellows to make a move against us is not far off. Once they break the agreement on the time we set, it means they will have absolute confidence in destroying us completely and making us disappear from this world. This is something neither you nor I want to see, so it's time for us to cultivate as well. This time, we must succeed. You're right, our resolve hasn't changed. In fact, the first time Nian Bing kissed us, he took our first kiss simultaneously. At that moment, I understood that your thoughts were correct. In fact, it's good for us to maintain our current mindset. Only in this mindset can we possibly succeed.\"\n\nKao smiled and said, \"Let's keep everything as memories. We'll prepare for a while longer, and then it will be time to go. Now, I just hope those three fellows reveal themselves a little later. Oh, right, your long-range perception is stronger than mine. You must do your best to monitor Nian Bing's situation. You can't let him get truly hurt.\"\n\nTianxiang said, \"Don't worry, I will. From the moment he left here until now, every move he's made has been under my surveillance. Do you want me to describe the scene of him making love with his wife? You've experienced it too. Nian Bing is indeed very strong in that regard.\"\n\n\"Go to hell,\" Kao said through gritted teeth.\n\nTianxiang finally got the upper hand and said with a smile, \"If I die, won't you die too? I've already figured out the method for our plan. The possibility of success has increased a lot. Although it means sacrificing Nian Bing, it will fulfill us, so it can be considered his good fortune. At least, we will never forget his existence. It's a pity we can't even leave our souls to him. Speaking of which, don't we look like man-eating fairies?\"\n\nKao fell silent, a trace of genuine sadness appearing in his eyes. \"If we had a choice, I truly wouldn't want it to be like this. But we have no choice.\"\n\nTianxiang smiled and said, \"Alright, since we have no choice, let's not be wishy-washy. This isn't like you. Nian Bing won't die easily. Although our progress over these tens of thousands of years isn't as fast as those three fellows, we've accumulated countless pure life and death energies. Although we can't use these energies, we've given them all to Nian Bing. With the Orb of Life and the Orb of Death within him, unless it's us or those three fellows from Order, Time, and Destruction who make a move, no one else can kill him. We just need to focus on his cultivation and ensure no abnormalities arise. Then it will be fine.\"\n\nNian Bing, cultivating in his room on the Lost Continent far away, was oblivious to the fact that his every move was being monitored. After Long Ling left the room, he began his cultivation. It was a short period, only three days. In three days, Nian Bing naturally couldn't expect to make a qualitative leap. However, his strength in all aspects had improved recently. Although these three days couldn't be used for advancement, they could be used for adjustment, bringing his abilities to the best state, which could also improve his overall strength.\n\nNian Bing's initial cultivation was a thorough sensing of his acupoints. After he felt a significant increase in the West Meridian acupoint's ability to absorb innate energy last time, he had always felt that his West Meridian acupoint was likely to undergo some changes, of course, for the better. Even Nian Bing himself found it hard to believe that in such a short time, his West Meridian acupoint was about to enter the ultimate realm.\n\nNian Bing had now opened five acupoints. When the Emperor's Pole acupoint and the Heavenly Eye acupoint were still integrated, his strength could only reach the thirteenth level at most. With the help of the seven divine weapons, he had a chance to kill a thirteenth-level god. However, after the Emperor's Pole acupoint and the Heavenly Eye acupoint formed their current state through his bold exploration, possessing five acupoints, including the Heavenly Eye and the Emperor's Pole, directly propelled him to the fourteenth level. Nian Bing would have no fear even of the Main Gods. It's important to know that among the seven great acupoints, the Emperor's Pole acupoint and the Heavenly Eye acupoint are the most important, followed by the West Meridian acupoint and the Li Zhong acupoint. These four acupoints fundamentally change the owner's strength. As for the Fang Jia acupoint, Listening Cloud acupoint, and Earth Spirit acupoint, which are used for defense, hearing perception, and speed, they are somewhat inferior. Compared to the previous four acupoints, they are a bit weaker. And among the five acupoints Nian Bing has opened, they include the Heavenly Eye, Emperor's Pole, West Meridian, and Li Zhong. Moreover, his Heavenly Eye acupoint and Emperor's Pole acupoint have reached the ultimate realm under special circumstances, let alone the peculiar combination of the dual acupoints. On the mental power level, even Nian Bing doesn't know how much his strength has improved. Since the combination of the dual acupoints was opened by him using the burst acupoint method, he found that his control over magic had reached a new realm, even to the point of precisely controlling every magic element to his use. For several months, Nian Bing has never stopped cultivating. Now, he has gradually mastered the mysteries of the ultimate Heavenly Eye acupoint and the Emperor's Pole acupoint.\n\nBy means of his thoughts, Nian Bing propelled his mental power into the Heavenly Eye acupoint between his eyebrows, leaving his perception entirely there. Since the dual acupoints entered a state of half-separation and half-union, what he could feel in his brow was only a golden expanse. His mental power seemed to be beyond quantification. By leaving his perception entirely there, he could most accurately control the energy within his body and everything around him. His mental power slowly released. Although his eyes were closed, everything around him gradually became clear. As his mental power expanded, Nian Bing gradually saw the busy people of the Ice Moon Empire around him, saw Long Ling, saw Feng Nü and Lan Chen cultivating, and also saw Xi Lu. The speed of mental power expansion was very fast, but Nian Bing did not probe further. What he needed now was the integration of his own power, not detection.\n\nAs soon as his mental power was withdrawn, under Nian Bing's control, it surged towards the magic light clusters in his chest. He clearly saw every subtle change in his body. The Li Zhong acupoint in his chest, the West Meridian acupoint in his lower abdomen, and the Fang Jia acupoint on his back were all covered by his mental power. Nian Bing discovered that regardless of which acupoint it was, if it wasn't illuminated by the light of the Emperor's Pole acupoint, when the acupoint's energy reached its ultimate state, its own light would turn golden. Before that, the light was milky white. After the burst acupoint incident last time, Nian Bing found the changes in his other three acupoints. The milky white light of these three acupoints had become much denser than before the burst acupoint, and some golden light was already mixed within. Although there was no one to guide him in the cultivation of acupoints, Nian Bing vaguely understood that these three acupoints were already progressing towards the ultimate state. The ultimate realm of acupoints is completely different from the intermediate stage. The functions of the acupoints will be maximized. Whether it's the Li Zhong acupoint, which condenses energy, or the West Meridian acupoint, which controls innate energy, this is very evident. Even the defense of the Fang Jia acupoint, after reaching the ultimate state, will inevitably be much stronger than the current intermediate stage. It's a pity there's no time for him to continue cultivating. Otherwise, Nian Bing was confident that he could reach the state of all seven acupoints open in the near future. At that time, the five Main Gods would no longer be a fatal threat.\n\nHow can these three acupoints break through their current bottleneck? Nian Bing pondered. While thinking, he propelled his mental power to scan the different energies within the acupoints. Each scan was extremely cautious, for fear that his mental power might affect the changes in the internal energy, leading to adverse consequences. Nian Bing knew very well that with the full capabilities of his five acupoints, no one among the strong cultivators on the Yangguang Continent could contend with him. This also meant that in the battle with the Divine Continent, he would be the most important member. Therefore, he could not afford any mistakes, otherwise, this battle would be lost before it even began. Thus, each time he explored, he would restrain the overbearing aura of the Emperor's Pole acupoint contained in his mental power, and then enter the acupoint to observe carefully.\n\nAfter a brief observation of the acupoints, Nian Bing immediately dismissed the idea. No matter which acupoint it was, the energy within the acupoint was extremely condensed, and he had no idea how to make these energies undergo qualitative changes. Nian Bing had also considered trying to induce the energy within the acupoints, but he also understood that luck couldn't always accompany him. Achieving the excellent results like the last burst acupoint would be very difficult again. In the process of inducing the energy within the acupoints, if something went wrong, it was very likely to have the opposite effect, which would be a loss that outweighed the gain. Therefore, after weighing the pros and cons, he decided to give up the idea of helping the acupoints reach the ultimate realm. Now that they had reached a bottleneck, continuously cultivating them to evolve naturally was the most secure method. Thinking of this, he carefully withdrew his mental power from the acupoints and transferred it to the magic light clusters in his chest and abdomen. With the West Meridian acupoint, the consumption of his own magic power for instant magic had been reduced by several times. The magic elements within his body only needed to play an inducing role, rather than relying entirely on this magic power to cast spells. Moreover, the Li Zhong acupoint could compress and restrain the innate energy condensed outside his body. This was why his strength had made a qualitative leap after opening these two acupoints. Kao had once told him that for magic beyond the fourteenth level, there were no real incantations. When casting magic of that degree, the control of one's own mental power played a crucial role, and the attack power of magic beyond the fourteenth level was manifested in a pure energy form.\n\nNian Bing's magic was very special, using the origin of ice and fire as a guide to achieve the effect of using seven-element magic. Now, his seven-element magic was no longer as simple as mimicry, but true seven-element magic. The first time Nian Bing felt that he no longer needed to cast seven-element magic through the special nature of mimicry was after the Heavenly Eye acupoint reached the intermediate stage. The Heavenly Eye acupoint's perception of energy had deepened his understanding of seven-element magic by countless times. He could now fully understand the characteristics of each magic element, which also enabled him to use these seven-element magic elements at will.\n\nThe auxiliary effect of the seven divine blades was fully realized only after the Heavenly Eye acupoint reached the ultimate state and the West Meridian acupoint appeared, especially in the utilization of multi-element magic in the air. The West Meridian acupoint could condense the purest magic elements into innate energy for his use, while the seven divine blades could greatly accelerate the condensation of this innate energy. Furthermore, the aura of the seven divine blades had long been connected with Nian Bing. Even when using the seven-element blade soul for attack and defense, this amplification effect still existed.",

    "content": "Careful contemplation greatly boosted Nian Bing’s confidence. He faintly felt that, even when facing the most powerful High Gods, he could put up a fight with his advantages. However, what could he accomplish in these short three days? Evolving his acupoints to the ultimate stage was unlikely. Increasing his magical power also required prolonged meditation for noticeable results. Moreover, even if his magical power slightly increased when he could utilize his external innate energy, the impact on his strength would not be significant. As for improving his mental strength, Nian Bing knew very well that the physical mental attacks from his Celestial Eye acupoint could now be mixed with the dominance of his Imperial Emperor acupoint. In this regard, perhaps apart from those four True Gods, no one else in the world could compare to him. However, what troubled Nian Bing was that despite his mental strength being powerful, he was completely clueless about how to cultivate it. When he only had the Celestial Eye acupoint, he could still grasp some clues. But now, the situation was very complex. Regarding the Celestial Eye and Imperial Emperor acupoints, which were fused together, although he could use them separately or combine them to launch attacks that utilized the abilities of both, Nian Bing had no idea where to start with cultivation. His abilities were limited to these few, and he didn’t even know how to cultivate them. So, what else could he do? In three days, what could he possibly achieve? Thinking this, Nian Bing fell into contemplation once more. He continuously analyzed and considered his various abilities, trying to see how he could improve them through simple integration. This thinking was agonizing. As his brain worked at high capacity, Nian Bing gradually entered a meditative state. He had begun meditating in the early morning, and this process of thinking lasted until dusk that day.\n\nNian Bing, who was sitting cross-legged on the bed, suddenly opened his eyes. Electricity flashed in his eyes, and a knowing smile revealed itself at the corner of his lips. A seven-colored light surged from his Celestial Eye acupoint. With a flash of light, seven divine sabers simultaneously appeared before him. Under the control of his Celestial Eye domain, they floated in mid-air. Looking at these seven divine sabers, Nian Bing’s mental strength divided into seven streams, simultaneously infusing into the sabers. Seven-colored lights of blue, red, green, yellow, silver, white, and gold lit up simultaneously. Seven identical saber spirits floated out gracefully, each raising their hands and grasping their respective divine sabers. Among the saber spirits of the seven divine artifacts, the saber spirit of the Demon Devouring Saber, Hei Wu Huang, was clearly the leader. Among the seven saber spirits, only Hei Wu Huang possessed not only intelligence but also the ability to speak. At first glance, their bodies were exactly like seven Nian Bings, distinguishable only by the different auras and colors of energy emanating from them. Each saber spirit was clad in a simple warrior's outfit. Their energetic bodies were exceptionally solid under the influence of innate energy, no longer illusory. The greatest benefit of these saber spirits was that no matter how powerful the blow or damage they sustained, as long as the divine saber remained, they could recover in a short period, which was a special characteristic of divine artifacts. Compared to before their reforging, these intelligent saber spirits recovered much faster. Moreover, with the advent of intelligence, they were no longer limited to simply attacking with speed. After the previous battle in Ice Valley, Nian Bing carefully considered his gains and losses and realized he had underestimated the abilities of the saber spirits. At that time, when he was facing the attacks of nine divine beings alone, if he had coordinated his own strength with the saber spirits of the seven divine sabers, he would not have been without the power to fight. However, because he lacked the ability of physical mental attacks at that time, Nian Bing did not have a strong grasp of the saber spirits, so he chose to recall them and utilize the special magical defense taught to him by Ka’ao. He later realized that if he had used the saber spirits’ abilities in time, the situation would have been much easier. Looking at the seven saber spirits before him, he already had a plan for the remaining more than two days of cultivation.\n\n“Senior Hei Wu Huang, I have a question for you.” Nian Bing looked at Hei Wu Huang, whose entire body was enshrouded in restrained black light. Currently, although Hei Wu Huang had given the demonic beasts originally stored in the Demon Devouring Saber to Meow Meow as Nian Bing wished, another being had appeared in his saber: Ming Wu Sa Fen. Xie Yue had left, and Sa Fen, after seeing his elder brother again, was truly unwilling to depart. Furthermore, after witnessing the powerful strength of Nian Bing and the others, he became even more aware of his own weakness. Therefore, he decided to remain in the Demon Devouring Saber, using the dark energy within the saber to cultivate with Hei Wu Huang. Since he was an energy being himself, being stored in the Demon Devouring Saber was perfectly suitable.\n\nHei Wu Huang nodded and said, “Ask.” Nian Bing had never regarded the seven saber spirits as mere summoned energy; instead, he considered them his friends, even elders. Although the saber spirits of the other six divine sabers could not yet speak, Nian Bing knew very well that the saber spirits within those six sabers were the six dwarven masters who had sacrificed themselves to fulfill him and Xi Lu back then! Fearing that they would suffer real harm, Nian Bing had not fully utilized their strength last time.\n\nNian Bing stood up and walked in front of the seven saber spirits. “Senior Hei Wu Huang, I want to know the true extent of your current strength, the seven of you saber spirits. I mean when using the seven divine sabers. When I cast magic now, even though you control the divine sabers, the aura of the divine sabers is connected to me. As long as we maintain a certain distance, I can still receive the amplification effect of magic without holding them. Therefore, in the future, whenever the seven divine sabers appear in battle, they will be fully controlled by you.”\n\nHei Wu Huang said without hesitation, “Last time, when we were on the Divine Continent, we received help from that Death Lake. My strength has basically returned to its previous state. With the support of the divine sabers’ abilities, I can reach around the thirteenth stage. The death energy in that Death Lake was the purest. You also know that death energy itself is a type of dark energy, which was of great help to me. Therefore, during this period, I have been continuously cultivating within the Demon Devouring Saber, fully absorbing this death aura. Even without using the Demon Devouring Saber, I should have the strength of the thirteenth stage. Back then, when I defeated the Dark Dragon King Ka’exiosis, I was only at this level. Now, I am even a bit stronger than my peak state. If I am further aided by the Demon Devouring Saber, even if I don’t reach the fourteenth stage, I should not be far from it. Originally, those High Gods feared that I would pose a threat to them if I reached the fourteenth stage of strength, and I was unwilling to yield to the Divine Continent. Therefore, they united the power of several High Gods to unleash a powerful divine punishment and destroy my physical body. You are the owner of the seven divine sabers, your soul connected to the seven divine sabers. As spirits within the sabers, we naturally understand your intentions. Overall, since I was the previous owner of the Demon Devouring Saber and entered the saber directly in my complete spirit form, my strength is the strongest. Overall, I should be slightly inferior to the High Gods of the Divine Continent. As for the other six, their strength is inferior. The individual saber spirits’ abilities range from approximately the eleventh to the twelfth stage. With the addition of the divine sabers’ abilities, they should all reach the peak of the twelfth stage, possessing strength close to the thirteenth stage. Therefore, for you, we can be considered your small legion, a legion composed of the seven saber spirits. Because our attributes complement each other, when we launch a joint attack, there is a certain bonus effect. When facing those High Gods, if all seven of us go together, we should be able to withstand two High Gods without much problem. If it's just one High God, I am confident I can kill him within half an hour. Against two High Gods, we can basically fight to a draw. Any more than that would be impossible, and it would easily lead to a rout. The bonus I mentioned, of course, can only be manifested within your Celestial Eye domain, because only through your Celestial Eye domain can our attributes complement each other.”\n\nNian Bing looked at Hei Wu Huang in astonishment, almost stunned. He never expected that such immense power had been by his side all along, capable of contending with two High Gods. Why did he go to such lengths to activate his acupoints when facing Gu Long and Xia Yu before? However, the saber spirits had a drawback: they had to be released by him to appear. Only Hei Wu Huang could appear on his own due to his affinity with the Demon Devouring Saber. But as his strength gradually recovered, and he no longer needed to absorb additional dark energy, he would not easily appear without his command either. Therefore, last time, he had almost perished at the hands of those two High Gods. Looking at the seven saber spirits before him, Nian Bing couldn’t help but smile wryly. “I never expected your strength to become so great, far exceeding mine.”\n\nHei Wu Huang said calmly, “No, don’t belittle yourself. Your current abilities are not weaker than our combined strength. Your greatest advantage is the ability to use any magic attack freely. Now, with physical mental attack assistance, your strength has fully reached the High God realm. Nian Bing, there is one thing I must remind you. When I made comparisons to the High Gods just now, I was referring to the two who came last time. However, if my judgment is correct, among the Eight Great High Gods, the two who came last time were likely the weakest. There is also a significant gap in strength among the High Gods. Those two last time had only opened four acupoints and had barely reached the fourteenth stage through years of cultivation. As for the other High Gods, the Dragon God’s strength should be in the mid-fourteenth stage, merely average among the High Gods. The remaining five High Gods are progressively stronger, each likely having opened at least five acupoints, with their strength potentially reaching the mid to high levels of the fourteenth stage. If that is the case, the seven of us can only deal with one High God. And you yourself can only handle one at most. Back then, I had a certain understanding of the Divine Continent. As far as I know, among those High Gods, there should already be those who have opened six acupoints. Although opening seven acupoints is the ultimate limit of human strength, almost impossible to achieve, they have survived for tens of thousands of years. By utilizing these tens of thousands of years, the strongest High God could completely cultivate his six acupoints to the ultimate realm. In that case, his strength would likely be infinitely close to the fifteenth stage. Therefore, we must be cautious.”",

    "content": "Hearing Emperor Hei Wu mention the six ultimate realm acupoints, Nian Bing couldn't help but frown. He naturally understood what six ultimate acupoints represented, as he himself possessed five, and they were the five most beneficial for enhancing his own strength. If the opponent had a divine being with six opened acupoints, this battle would undoubtedly become more arduous. The difference between the fourteenth and thirteenth ranks was vast, and the difference between the fifteenth and fourteenth ranks was also qualitative. Thinking of this, his worries deepened.\n\nEmperor Hei Wu suddenly said, \"Nian Bing, I must remind you of something. Do not overestimate the strength of your spiritual power physical attacks. Last time, those two main gods, one dead and one injured by your spiritual power attack, did not represent their true strength. Those who can reach the fourteenth rank already possess extremely powerful spiritual power. If they are deliberately cautious, even if you can kill a main god with your physical spiritual power, you will pay dearly for it, a thousand enemies killed will cost you eight hundred lives. You must understand that physical spiritual power is a double-edged sword; do not use it lightly unless absolutely necessary. Once the enemy is too powerful, even if their spiritual power is inferior to yours, after a physical spiritual power attack, your own spiritual power will suffer a great impact. At that time, the enemy will be dead, but you will be unable to attack for a considerable period. Among you all, you are the true commander. The real battle is the battle between strong individuals. Therefore, no matter how this war progresses, you must maintain your own strength to be prepared for any situation. Only under your leadership is it possible for this war to achieve true victory. Moreover, without your help, even if you released us beforehand, our strength would be greatly diminished. You are the master of these seven divine blades, and also their foundation. Therefore, do not act impulsively during battle. If I had been more tactful and cautious in my actions back then, I would not be in this state now. This is my advice to you, and I hope you will heed it.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded sincerely. \"Thank you, Senior Emperor Hei Wu. I will engrave every word you have spoken into my heart. Hearing your words has allowed me to estimate those divine beings more accurately. You now know my thoughts, so we should begin. Time is pressing, and I hope that within these two days, there will be some improvement for you and for me.\"\n\nEmperor Hei Wu nodded, and the other six blade souls also nodded. The seven divine blades flashed with light and simultaneously merged into the bodies of the seven blade souls. They emitted a layer of departmental light around their bodies, filling the room with the aura of seven elemental magic. Because they all belonged to Nian Bing, under these circumstances, the magical elements they emitted did not affect each other.\n\nThe Heaven's Eye Domain emanated from Nian Bing's brow and instantly permeated every corner of the stone house. Under the amplification effect of the Heaven's Eye Domain, the radiance of the seven blade souls immediately became more potent. They flashed and surrounded Nian Bing, sitting cross-legged around him. In this manner, each of them could receive an equal amplification effect directly from Nian Bing's Heaven's Eye Domain.\n\nFeeling the stable aura of the seven blade souls, Nian Bing also sat cross-legged on the ground. At this moment, his mind was completely withdrawn. Through the connection of his soul with the seven divine blades, he could clearly feel that the seven blade souls within the seven divine blades were now fully concentrating their auras on him, allowing him to communicate with them most directly. Sitting cross-legged, he took a deep breath. Driven by his exceptionally powerful spiritual power, the light in his mind gradually flickered. A faint golden halo descended from his brow, directly entering his lower abdomen. Under the impetus of his spiritual power, a gentle, milky white light floated out, forming a spherical shape that completely enveloped himself and the seven blade souls. For a time, the surrounding air gradually changed. With the function of the West Pass acupoint, the purest innate human qi surged forth, the essence of heaven and earth. First, the melody of Earth's Awakening, belonging to the earth element, began. The light flickered, and the blade soul of the Longevity Blade suddenly burst forth with a layer of jade-like radiance, merging with its original yellow light. The yellow-green light crystallized on the surface of its body. Immediately, as if infected, the radiance around the bodies of the seven blade souls lit up successively. Nian Bing used the purest innate qi he had absorbed and, with his incomparably powerful spiritual power, separated the innate qi according to its attributes. Through the earth beneath him, he condensed innate qi and injected it into the seven elemental blade souls separately. With the complete infusion of innate qi, the radiance around the bodies of the seven blade souls became brighter and brighter, and gradually, their originally physical forms began to change. Their clothes disappeared, and seven bodies identical to Nian Bing sat cross-legged around him. Each body was exactly the same, but their bodies were no longer physical, transforming into a radiance like precious gems.\n\nThe Roar of the God of Fire – True Sun Blade. The blade soul erupted with a dazzling red light, and that scorching radiance enveloped the blade soul's body, which seemed to be carved from rubies, continuously surging into its interior. The situations of the other six blade souls were almost the same as that of the True Sun Blade's soul, except for the difference in the intensity of their emitted light. The Sigh of the Ice Snow Goddess – Morning Dew Blade's soul, its body transformed into a blue-white ice crystal body. The Whisper of the Free Wind – Proud Heaven Blade, transformed into a light cyan wind body, with swirling vortex-like cyan energy constantly rotating around its body. The Melody of Earth's Awakening – Longevity Blade's soul, had already transformed into a yellow-green gem-like body. Its vital aura was also influenced by the Life Sphere within Nian Bing. Although the yellow-green light itself was not dazzling, due to the immense vitality, the feeling of life made the stone house filled with solidified life energy. If there were a seed in the room at this moment, it would likely sprout in this vast life aura.\n\nThe Six-Pointed Star of Divine Machinations underwent the most significant change under the infusion of immense innate qi. His body did not transform into a crystalline gem-like physical form like the other blade souls. With the continuous influx of innate qi, the silver light around his body repeatedly underwent a process of sudden brightening and sudden dimming. With each flash of light, the Spatial Blade soul would experience a process of disappearing and reappearing. It was as if his body had become more illusory. The Celestial Sphere Blade would appear in mid-air when he disappeared, the silver gem on the blade emitting a mysterious radiance.\n\nThe Dawn that Pierces Heaven and Earth – Sacred Radiance Blade. His blade soul perfectly complemented the Longevity Blade's soul. The Longevity Blade's soul radiated life energy, while his radiated sacred energy, which was not just the holy energy possessed by light magic, but also an intangible authority. This surging sacred energy, in conjunction with the Longevity Blade's life energy, maximally influenced everything around them.\n\nEmperor Hei Wu was the most tranquil. Although the clothes formed by his energy had also disappeared, the changes in his body were the least significant. On his skin, which was similar in color to Nian Bing's, a layer of pure black mist appeared. Layers of faint black mist rose in continuous condensation. Although the surrounding life energy and sacred energy were very strong, they did not affect the faint black mist around Emperor Hei Wu's body at all. This layer of black mist, although not obvious, would surely cause Xie Yue to exclaim in shock if he were present, because it was the purest dark energy. Unlike the death energy within Nian Bing's Death Sphere, this energy had no evil or other negative auras, but was pure dark energy. For both dark mages and dark warriors, this purest dark energy was their ultimate goal. Under the effect of immense innate qi, such energy actually appeared around Emperor Hei Wu's body.\n\nNian Bing’s eyes were closed, but he could clearly see everything around him through his Heaven's Eye acupoint. Using the West Pass acupoint as the source for absorbing innate qi, he first drew the innate qi into his own body. After condensation by the Li Zhong acupoint, and then through skillful control of his spiritual power, he injected it into the seven elemental blade souls separately according to their different attributes. At this moment, the seven elemental blade souls were at their strongest state since their inception. However, this state was not stable, because they had not yet fully absorbed this innate qi. It was precisely because of this that Nian Bing had more important and difficult tasks to do next.\n\nAfter a day of contemplation, Nian Bing had already figured out the direction of his cultivation in the coming days. Since his own strength was not easy to improve, he would focus his efforts on the seven blade souls. At least, he clearly knew what the blade souls cultivated with. Even the purest innate qi could promote their strength, of course, this also depended on the extent to which the blade souls absorbed it. Therefore, before the cultivation began, Nian Bing had carefully inquired about the current situation of Emperor Hei Wu and the others. It was precisely because of this that Nian Bing directly injected innate qi into their bodies at the beginning of the process. After all, as energy bodies that had surpassed the twelfth rank, accepting immense innate qi would not cause any harm to themselves. What Nian Bing had to do now was to forcefully inject these innate qi into the bodies of the blade souls with his powerful spiritual power, helping them improve their strength with the most direct method. This was not only an improvement for the blade souls but also a tempering of his own West Pass and Li Zhong acupoints. More importantly, in this situation, he could also gain a deeper understanding of the subtleties of combining the Emperor's Pole acupoint and the Heaven's Eye acupoint to control spiritual power. Since it was not an attack but an infusion, the integration of his strong spiritual power in this manner was without any danger. Having carefully considered this method, Nian Bing had found the best way to achieve improvement in a short period. He was not fundamentally improving his own strength, but rather finding a way to fully unleash the strength he had already improved. At the same time, it could also help the seven blade souls improve their strength, thereby increasing the overall strength to some extent.\n\nThe seven blade souls shone with their respective colors. As the innate qi continued to strengthen, the radiance on their bodies became even more brilliant. The previously calm seven blade souls began to change. Except for Emperor Hei Wu, who could still maintain his previous stability, all other blade souls' bodies began to tremble slightly. Everything had a limit. The innate qi they could control was related to the strength of their souls. Undoubtedly, Emperor Hei Wu possessed the most outstanding soul strength, while the other six blade souls were roughly similar. At this moment, although the innate qi input into their bodies was not their own power, it had already approached the limit they could withstand. When their bodies were about to become overloaded, it was inevitable that they would experience discomfort.\n\nIt was at this moment that seven streams of spiritual power emanating from Nian Bing were appropriately injected into the bodies of the seven blade souls. After his spiritual power entered, guided by his soul, it quickly found the location of the souls of the seven blade souls. The spiritual power, carrying the dominance of the Emperor's Pole acupoint, easily merged into the souls of the seven blade souls. Nian Bing focused his mind into seven parts, and the spiritual power emanating from him acted simultaneously. The six blade souls, which had been trembling, immediately became calm. With Nian Bing's help, they could now easily control the intensity of the innate qi condensed around their bodies.\n\nThe innate qi continued to gather towards the seven blade souls under Nian Bing's incessant prompting, and he also divided his spiritual power into seven parts, continuously injecting them into the blade souls' bodies. In this way, he condensed these innate qi within the blade souls' bodies, matching the improvement of the innate qi. As a result, the physical changes of the blade souls became increasingly apparent. From their original physical state to a crystalline state, they now returned to their physical forms. Under the effect of Nian Bing's spiritual power, all the blade souls were imbued with the dominant aura from his spiritual power, which originated from the Emperor's Pole acupoint. Furthermore, with Nian Bing using his own spiritual power as the foundation to assist in improving their spiritual power, their individual tolerance became increasingly strong. When Nian Bing had injected approximately half of his spiritual power, he stopped. This was because he knew very well that if he continued to inject spiritual power along with innate qi, once his spiritual power was withdrawn, these seven blade souls would all inevitably be overwhelmed and die from the massive innate qi. Therefore, he first stopped the West Pass acupoint from absorbing innate qi, and then carefully stopped the injection of spiritual power, creating a temporary balance within the seven blade souls.",

    "content": "Nian Bing didn't know how much time had passed, but he clearly felt that the innate energy absorbed by his Western Meridian Point had undergone a long infusion process. After stopping the energy infusion, he carefully controlled his mental power to maintain the seven Blade Souls, while observing their current situation through the Heavenly Eye Point.\n\nThe soul power of the seven Blade Souls was rapidly increasing under the influence of Nian Bing's mental power. These Blade Souls had two foundations: one was their own soul, and the other was their belonging Divine Blade. The Divine Blade was their true foundation; only when the Divine Blade existed could these seven Blade Souls continue to exist. Nian Bing, through the Heavenly Eye Point's sensitive perception of energy, found that the compatibility between these Blade Souls and their Divine Blades had become more harmonious under the pressure of the extremely vast innate energy surrounding them. The newly injected innate energy was also gradually fusing with the individual abilities of the seven Blade Souls and their respective Divine Blades. This could be said to be the fastest way to enhance the power of the Blade Souls. However, Nian Bing also knew very well that this method was very dangerous. The souls of the Blade Souls were not cultivated by the Divine Blades themselves, but were injected through special forging methods. Only Hei Wu Huang was an exception; he chose to enter the blade with his soul through his own compatibility with the Devouring Demon Blade. Now, if it weren't for his mental power controlling the innate energy outside, even Hei Wu Huang would not have been able to withstand the vastness of this innate energy. Therefore, what Nian Bing had to do now was to use his mental power as support to help these Blade Souls absorb as much innate energy as possible and strengthen their souls to better control this innate energy. The stronger they became, the safer they would be within this vast innate energy. Nian Bing realized that this special cultivation method could only be performed once after he conceived it, because if his mental power were not much stronger than the combined strength of the seven Blade Souls, he would not be able to control this cultivation method at all. Once the Blade Souls' strength increased overall, if they were to use this method again, Nian Bing would be the first to suffer. The souls of the Blade Souls were all closely related to him, and if there was a backlash due to excessive innate energy, Nian Bing would be the first to suffer. Therefore, in this one opportunity, Nian Bing's goal was to increase the strength of these Blade Souls as much as possible, although the extent to which they could be improved was difficult to say. After all, he was controlling seven at once, and although his mental power was powerful, it was ultimately limited.\n\nTime passed by the second, and the absorption rate of innate energy by the Blade Souls remained slow. Even though Nian Bing had successively used the aura of the Life Orb and the Death Orb to help the six Blade Souls and Hei Wu Huang respectively, the effect was not very significant. After all, the strengthening of the soul was not that easy. However, even so, the innate energy absorbed by the seven Blade Souls and converted into their own power was still many times faster than that of Qing Chang. The most crucial element in the cultivation process was Nian Bing's mental power. His mental power was the bridge and the link; without the auxiliary control of this mental power, the current situation would not have been possible. While using his mental power to constantly utilize various auxiliary methods to help the Blade Souls absorb this energy, Nian Bing also gained a deeper understanding of the current state of his mental power. He was delighted to discover that, just as he had predicted, the ability his mental power now possessed was the result of the fusion of the Heavenly Eye and the Imperial Extreme Meridian Points. His mental power was already different from what the Heavenly Eye Point should possess. After those few abnormal changes, the condensation and energy of his mental power far surpassed what the Heavenly Eye Point should have originally possessed. Perhaps it was precisely because the condensation of his mental power was too high that an Imperial Extreme Meridian Point appeared within his mental power. The appearance of this Imperial Extreme Meridian Point could be considered accidental, but it could also be considered inevitable due to the improvement of his strength. And before his meridian point explosion, he was unable to use physical mental power attacks because the Imperial Extreme Meridian Point and the Heavenly Eye Point were undergoing a magical fusion process. However, during this process, because the energies of the two acupoints were different—one being spiritual and the other substantial—although some of their commonalities had successfully fused, their differences were mutually restraining. This caused him to be able to apply a little of their abilities separately but not achieve the best results. His meridian point explosion coincidentally separated their differences while completely fusing their commonalities. Through these commonalities, the energies of the Heavenly Eye Point and the Imperial Extreme Meridian Point could undergo a magical transformation, just like when he first cultivated Ice and Fire Dual-Source Magic. Therefore, now, through the dual acupoints of Heavenly Eye and Imperial Extreme, whether it was the application of magic or mental power attacks, they could achieve a very powerful level by utilizing the characteristics of the combined acupoints. By using the dual acupoints for attacks of different degrees, he could change them at will. Mental power attacks and direct acupoint energy attacks have fundamental differences in energy form. Therefore, if he could utilize the opponent's psychology and change his attacks, he could achieve unexpected results.\n\nTherefore, during this period, Nian Bing's control over his dual acupoints had greatly improved compared to before. At least he had figured out how to utilize the fusion of his dual acupoints under different circumstances and what effects these characteristics could achieve.\n\nWith the help of mental power, the innate energy condensed within the bodies of the seven Blade Souls continued to be absorbed slowly. As their strength increased, Nian Bing's mental power control became increasingly difficult. After all, the innate energy infused by Nian Bing into the Blade Souls was controllable by him, and the stronger the Blade Souls became, the stronger their resistance to external mental power control would be. Therefore, as the control became more difficult, the mental power output by Nian Bing also increased. When his mental power output reached as high as ninety percent, he stopped controlling the innate energy, otherwise, if his mental power was completely output and could not be withdrawn smoothly, he himself would inevitably suffer a fierce backlash from the innate energy, which would not be worth the loss.\n\nAs the control of innate energy stopped, Nian Bing almost instantly withdrew all his mental power. At the same time, he retracted the Heavenly Eye Domain back into himself, transforming its amplification effect into defense and weakening.\n\nThe moment he completed these actions, the lights on the seven Blade Souls suddenly brightened. Under the guidance of Nian Bing's mental power, the light emitted from the seven Blade Souls shot straight up. The stone house offered no resistance at all; the roof immediately turned to dust and disappeared, and seven streams of colored light shot into the sky. The seven Blade Souls simultaneously let out a long, sharp cry. Without the control of mental power, the excess innate energy within their bodies could only dissipate on its own, while the absorbed innate energy had become a part of themselves. In just three days, with Nian Bing's full assistance, the strength of the seven Blade Souls had improved significantly. Even Safin within Hei Wu Huang's body had benefited considerably. Although this cultivation method could not be repeated, Nian Bing still seized the opportunity, achieving a qualitative leap in a short period.\n\nThe seven streams of colored light shooting into the sky immediately attracted the attention of the surrounding warriors of the Ice Moon Empire. The terrifyingly vast power immediately drew all their gazes towards the stone house where Nian Bing was located.\n\nLong Ling had been waiting outside for a full three days. During this time, she had wanted to bring Nian Bing some food, but every time she touched the door of the stone house, she could clearly feel an exceptionally vast magical energy, which seemed to be the energy of a barrier. She was afraid of disturbing Nian Bing, and secondly, she indeed had no ability to open this stone door. Therefore, she could only wait outside the door.\n\nThe sudden appearance of colored light and the violent fluctuation of magical elements startled Long Ling. When she saw the attributes represented by the seven beams of light, her heart gradually relaxed, and she secretly guessed that Nian Bing might have made a breakthrough in these short three days.\n\nThe stone door opened, and the dense magical aura caused a magical storm within a hundred zhang radius. Fortunately, Long Ling's own strength had already reached the realm of a Magic Seeker, so she was not harmed by these unstable magical elements, but she still felt a little uncomfortable. Nian Bing walked out of the stone house shirtless. The first thing Long Ling saw on his face was fatigue.\n\n\"Bing, are you okay?\" Long Ling walked a few steps to Nian Bing's side and supported his arm. When she touched the warm skin of Nian Bing's arm, her pretty face couldn't help but blush slightly.\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"It's nothing, just a little tired.\" Continuously operating his mental power for three days to compress innate energy for the seven Blade Souls was probably something only his abnormal mental power could achieve. The massive consumption of mental power would naturally make him feel tired, but with his mental power strength and his own five acupoints, he would recover in a relatively short time.\n\n\"Ling'er, has Feng Nu and Chen Chen's cultivation ended?\"\n\n\"We finished yesterday.\" Lights flashed, and two exceptionally beautiful figures arrived beside Nian Bing. How could the intense magical fluctuations earlier not have alerted them? Feng Nu and Lan Chen floated before Nian Bing, their pretty faces showing more radiance, clearly indicating that their strength had improved again. Nian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"How is it? Has the Phoenix Heart helped you achieve the Nine Phoenix Transformations?\"\n\nFeng Nu said with a wry smile, \"It's not that simple. Chen Chen and I tried it. For some reason, even though we've fused the Phoenix Heart with our bodies, we can't truly absorb this energy for some reason. Although our strength has improved slightly, we still can't reach the level of the ninth transformation. Perhaps the final ninth transformation requires some special conditions.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"It's okay, cultivation cannot be rushed, otherwise it will have the opposite effect. Time waits for no one, what is the situation with the four great armies?\" As soon as he asked this question, he saw Mu Jing and Luo Rou rushing over.\n\nThe two women arrived in front of Nian Bing. To Nian Bing's embarrassment, they first glanced at the three women beside him before looking at Nian Bing with questioning eyes.\n\nNian Bing shrugged and said, \"I'm fine. How are your troop movements?\"\n\nMu Jing said, \"Big Brother, the army has been assembled and can depart at any time. Prince Rong's army has also arrived. When do you think we should leave?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Since that's the case, let's leave now. The sooner we get there, the sooner we can make arrangements.\"\n\nLuo Rou and Mu Jing nodded simultaneously. Nian Bing couldn't bear to meet the sparkling eyes of the two women. In front of Feng Nu, Lan Chen, and Long Ling, he really wished Luo Rou and Mu Jing would leave quickly to avoid causing him more trouble.\n\nAt this moment, Lan Chen suddenly said, \"Wait a moment, Nian Bing, Mom and Dad haven't arrived yet. Should we wait for them?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart moved, and he exclaimed in surprise, \"They haven't arrived yet? Could they have been delayed by something?\" He had already notified the Ice God Tower. According to the time, Rong Tian and Bing Ling should have arrived on the day he went into seclusion. Upon hearing that his parents hadn't arrived yet, his face couldn't help but show a trace of anxiety. His parents' contribution to their side was not the most important thing, but at this critical juncture, he did not want his parents to suffer any harm.\n\nLan Chen quickly said, \"Nian Bing, don't worry. With Dad and Mom's strength, unless they encounter gods, they won't be in trouble. I've already selected twenty high-level magic experts from the Ice God Tower to welcome them. We'll have news by tonight at the latest.\"\n\nNian Bing forced a smile and said, \"Alright, then we'll wait until tonight to depart. Jingjing, Rou'er, you two go back and prepare, and also notify my grandfather. I'll prepare the spatial teleportation magic array first. As soon as we receive news from my parents, we'll depart immediately.\"\n\nLuo Rou said, \"There's no rush. Our logistics and army are already in place and can depart at any time. Nian Bing, why don't you go and see Uncle and Aunt as well? If anything happens, you can handle it. You can rest assured about things here.\"\n\nNian Bing was indeed worried, but he also had to be in charge of the overall situation here. Hearing Luo Rou's words, he subconsciously nodded and gave Feng Nu and Lan Chen a look, saying, \"Alright, I'll go and welcome them, and I'll be back soon.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Nian Bing floated up. \"Kaka.\" Just as his body reached the peak of his jump, a huge golden-gray figure appeared out of thin air, propping up Nian Bing's body. As Kaka's strength increased, and Nian Bing had not opened his Earth Meridian Point, flying with Kaka was much faster than flying alone.",

    "content": "Despite feeling a pang of anxiety, every movement from Nian Bing as he leaped and landed on Kaka was smooth and precise, executed with effortless grace. Coupled with his tall, slender physique and handsome features, Luo Rou and Mu Jing's eyes sparkled with admiration. Feng Nu, standing nearby, furrowed her brow, while Lan Chen shook his head helplessly. Only Long Ling showed no outward reaction, her gaze fixed on Nian Bing, just like Luo Rou and Mu Jing, with no less sparkle in her beautiful eyes.\n\nNian Bing had another reason for summoning Kaka. While his perception of mental energy had strengthened over the past three days, his mental energy consumption had also been considerable. With Kaka providing flight, and their minds linked, Kaka could monitor for the presence of Bing Ling and Rong Tian along the route. This would allow Nian Bing to free up his energy to rest. His mental energy consumption was within his control, and he could fully recover in a short time.\n\nKaka's gray dragon body was enveloped in a layer of azure light. Nian Bing had cast a wind-element support magic spell on it, based on the Ao Tian Saber, which further increased Kaka's flight speed.\n\nLittle Dragon King Oscar spontaneously generated a faint gray airflow around Nian Bing's body, protecting him. Nian Bing sat cross-legged on Oscar's back. Oscar's current body was condensed from his own cultivated dragon power, infused with a large amount of Nian Bing's seven-element innate energy. A layer of dragon scales, identical to Oscar's, grew on Nian Bing's body. Although sitting cross-legged on Oscar's back, he wouldn't fall off regardless of Kaka's movements.\n\nYears of cultivation had made Nian Bing's mind extremely stable. Despite his anxiety, he quickly entered a state of cultivation. His fatigued mental energy transitioned from fluctuating to stable, rapidly recovering within the Tian Yan and Huang Ji acupuncture points. As his mental energy gradually condensed, Nian Bing's aura became increasingly steady.\n\nKaka's flight relied not only on his physical body but also on his attribute-less energy properties. With this special energy, he could arbitrarily drive any magic element in the air, just like Nian Bing. Physically, he was still far behind his parents. After all, his current body was condensed from energy. Although the Dragon God Heart Secret had been cultivated to a certain extent, his energy-condensed physical body was much weaker. However, he possessed abilities that Demante Ti and Katzeosis did not. Having shared the same body with Nian Bing since birth, and with his hatching completed with Nian Bing's help, Nian Bing's abilities had a significant influence on him, an influence that became more pronounced as Oscar matured. While he didn't have the Tian Yan acupuncture point like Nian Bing, he could control magic elements with ease through his unique attribute-less special ability. Combined with the dragon language magic unique to dragons, his magical abilities were not fully understood even by Nian Bing. In terms of magical offense or defense, other Dragon Kings might not be able to match him. When Nian Bing activated the dual acupuncture points for an explosion, although Kaka was temporarily separated, the momentary surge of energy greatly benefited Kaka. Currently, his Dragon God Heart Secret had even reached a level one higher than his father, the Dark Dragon King Katzeosis, reaching the sixth level. Every increase in Nian Bing's strength spurred Oscar's cultivation, especially Nian Bing's mental energy, which often assisted Oscar in breaking through bottlenecks in the Dragon God Heart Secret. Therefore, Kaka's overall strength was now comparable to the other six Dragon Kings, excluding Katzeosis. Of course, due to the lack of a physical body, he was also subject to certain restrictions, only able to exist within a thousand meters of Nian Bing. Otherwise, his energy body would dissipate due to the lack of innate energy replenishment from Nian Bing, and his soul would return to Nian Bing's body according to the imprint.\n\nOnce Nian Bing entered a state of cultivation, his concept of time vanished. He didn't know how long had passed when Oscar's voice echoed in his mind, \"Boss, wake up.\"\n\nHis mental energy shifted from condensed to dispersed, communicating with all the energy within his body. Nian Bing opened his eyes. His mental energy had fully recovered without him realizing it. All the magic elements in the air soared freely. Through the Tian Yan acupuncture point, he could clearly see the form and strength of each magic element. This wondrous sensation brought Nian Bing immense comfort.\n\nWithout Oscar needing to say anything, he sensed the active ice elements in the air. In the distance, several groups of blue lights were rapidly approaching him and Oscar. He glanced at the sky; it was already afternoon. After flying for half a day, he had finally met his parents.\n\nAs the figures grew closer, Nian Bing's exceptional eyesight clearly recognized the two flying at the forefront: his father, Rong Tian, and his mother, Bing Ling. Rong Tian's pure fire-element magic did not allow him to fly, but with Bing Ling's magical cultivation, carrying him was not difficult. Twenty ice-element mages followed them in formation. As soon as they saw him, Rong Tian and Bing Ling naturally saw him as well. Bing Ling hurried forward, and in a short while, arrived before Nian Bing and Oscar.\n\n\"Nian Bing, you must have been waiting long,\" Rong Tian chuckled. Seeing his son's heroic figure riding the dragon filled his heart with pride. How could he not feel a sense of satisfaction witnessing his son's outstanding achievements?\n\nNian Bing met his parents and said with a smile, \"Dad, Mom, are they alright? It's not too late, let's hurry back. Things should be happening there soon too.\"\n\nRong Tian sighed, \"We set out immediately after receiving your letter. I truly didn't expect the legendary Lost Continent to become like this. Later, your mother said she needed to wait a bit, and then mysteriously went to do something. I only found out what she was doing when we truly set off, which naturally caused a few days' delay.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at his mother with a hint of confusion. On the surface, Bing Ling seemed more like his elder sister than his mother, as the years had left no trace of time on her peerlessly beautiful face.\n\nBing Ling smiled slightly and said, \"Nian Bing, I've secured a very significant helper for you this time, and I have a surprise for you too. Senior Sister, you can come out now.\"\n\nBing Ling and Rong Tian moved aside. The ice-element mages behind them also parted in the air, creating a pathway. Two figures glided forward, arriving before Nian Bing amidst the blizzard.\n\nNian Bing stared at the two figures, dumbfounded. The one on the right was Bing Jie, who had impersonated the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess for many years. Although her appearance had changed, becoming more ordinary than the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, Nian Bing could never forget the aura she exuded. It was the tyrannical aura born from the mixture of the Huang Ji acupuncture point and ice-element magic, which no one else could imitate. While her appearance was not as breathtakingly beautiful as his mother's, nor as cold and elegant as the former Ice Snow Goddess Priestess, she possessed a gentle charm. At this moment, not a trace of her former self could be found. Her smiling face radiated happiness, making her look a few years older than his mother. She appeared more like a virtuous wife and loving mother. The smile on her face was so gentle, as if she were a completely different person compared to when she was disguised as the Ice Snow Goddess Priestess.\n\nBing Jie's appearance was not the true reason for Nian Bing's shock. With a strength not inferior to a Main God, Bing Jie's help to Nian Bing's side was naturally immense. However, what truly surprised Nian Bing was the person to Bing Jie's left. He held Bing Jie's hand, standing above the blizzard magic. He possessed no trace of magical aura, nor did he give anyone a sense of immense power. His somewhat aged face was exceptionally ruddy, and his nearly yellow eyes were filled with laughter and glistening tears. From the moment he appeared, his gaze had never left Nian Bing. He simply watched, observing the shifting lights in Nian Bing's eyes.\n\n\"Master.\" Nian Bing's voice was choked with tears and a slight hoarseness. He knelt on Oscar's back, tears streaming down his face. Standing before him, hand in hand with Bing Jie, was his master, whom he had believed to be dead. For a moment, Nian Bing felt as if he were in an illusion, his heart aching with sharp pangs. Even now, he still believed he was hallucinating, seeing what he longed to see due to his yearning for his master.\n\n\"Child.\" Tears flowed down Cha Ji's face as well. Looking at his spirited disciple, how could he not be moved?\n\n\"Master?\" Nian Bing finally came to his senses. Looking at the figure before him, clearer than ever, his second utterance of \"Master\" was filled with shock.\n\n\"It's me, you silly boy, I'm not dead. Although your master is not young, I've studied cooking for many years and have my ways of maintaining health. How could I die so easily? You silly boy almost burned me to death with that fire.\" Cha Ji's eyes still streamed with tears, but a smile had appeared on his face.\n\nNian Bing flashed forward, appearing before Cha Ji out of thin air. His movement was simple: he grabbed a few of Cha Ji's whiskers and pulled hard. Several gray-white whiskers immediately detached from Cha Ji's chin.\n\nCha Ji cried out in pain and said irritably, \"You brat, what are you doing?\"\n\nNian Bing looked at him in surprise, \"Master, you really aren't dead. You can still feel pain, so you're not a spirit.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, why don't you pinch yourself?\"\n\n\"Pinching myself hurts! I know I'm alive, so why should I pinch myself?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\nMaster and disciple looked at each other in silence. They simply gazed at one another. Cha Ji released Bing Jie's hand and looked at his disciple, whose eyes were still filled with tears. He smiled. The two tall figures merged, master and disciple embracing tightly.\n\nIt was only now, truly holding his master's slightly hunched body, that Nian Bing felt the genuine sense of reality. The scent on Cha Ji was something he was all too familiar with. Due to years of involvement in cooking, he always carried a faint scent of cooking smoke, and the myriad of essences contained within that scent were impossible for anyone to fake.\n\n\"Master.\" Nian Bing's tears flowed uncontrollably again. He held Cha Ji's body, his heart beating faster and faster. What could be more perfect than this? His parents were alive and well, and his master, whom he believed to be dead, had reappeared before him. Nian Bing's heart was filled with warmth. He was terrified, terrified that all of this was an illusion. However, in his master's warm embrace, it all felt so real.\n\nIf it hadn't been for Cha Ji back then, Nian Bing would not be where he was today. Even if he hadn't drowned with the Ice Snow Goddess Stone, surviving the turbulent Tian Qing River would not have been easy. Nian Bing never forgot Cha Ji's hardships and eight years of teaching. When Cha Ji \"died\" back then, although Nian Bing maintained his composure on the surface, trying to be strong, his heart was filled with endless sorrow. A trace of his solitary nature was indeed due to his parents, but Cha Ji's death had also given him a huge shock. Therefore, when he first entered society, his personality was a bit peculiar.\n\nAnd now, Cha Ji had appeared; he was not dead, truly not dead. Nian Bing's last bit of darkness completely vanished with his arrival. Feeling the familiar aura from his master, his tear-filled eyes blurred. He tightly embraced his master's body, fearing he would disappear into nothingness.\n\n\"Alright, you brat, go easy. Don't you know your master's old bones can't take it?\" Cha Ji said playfully. His mood was no different from Nian Bing's. Although Nian Bing's appearance hadn't changed much since he left Peach Blossom Forest, he had become more handsome and mature. The noble aura that subtly emanated from his enhanced mental energy and magic made him appear even more distinguished. Cha Ji's thoughts were no different from Rong Tian's; he also felt profound pride in his disciple.\n\nIn his fluster, Nian Bing quickly released his hold on his master. He looked up and down at Cha Ji, who hadn't changed much, and suddenly exclaimed, \"Master, you were faking your death that time, weren't you? Why did you lie to me?\"\n\nCha Ji feigned grievance, \"Fake death? I was in a coma at the time, not really dead. You brat didn't even check properly before setting fire to me. Fortunately, I reacted quickly, otherwise, I might have really died.\"\n\nNian Bing saw the smile in Cha Ji's eyes and knew he had guessed correctly. He said with a wry smile, \"Why? Master, why didn't you want me? Do you know how many things I encountered when I first entered society, and I didn't have a single family member by my side?\"",

    "content": "Chaji kindly patted Nian Bing's broad shoulders and said, \"Silly boy, if your master were still around, could you have become what you are now? Only when a young eagle spreads its own wings and faces everything alone can it grow the fastest. Your master can't be with you for a lifetime. Your growth needs to rely on your own efforts. Society is your best teacher. Your master already knows all the achievements you've gained; you haven't disgraced your master. Although I only took you as my disciple in my life, I am already content. Nian Bing! Your master has appeared, hasn't he? A real man, a great fellow, no more crying allowed.\"\n\nNian Bing wiped the tears from his face, looked at Chaji, then at his smiling parents and Bing Jie beside him, and asked, \"Master, where did you go afterwards? Were you in the Peach Blossom Forest the whole time?\"\n\nChaji shook his head and said, \"No, after you left, I also left there and moved to another place. Otherwise, if you had returned to the Peach Blossom Forest, wouldn't you have seen me again?\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned and asked, \"Moved to another place, where are you?\"\n\nChaji chuckled and said, \"You smelly boy, you'd never guess. Actually, I've been in Ice Moon City all along. Remember which two cities in the Ice Moon Empire had hotels that could participate in the culinary competition? Besides Qingfeng Zhai, where you went, there was my hotel in Ice Moon City, known as the most famous hotel in the Ice Moon Empire. When you arrived in Ice Moon City, I heard the news. I was even afraid you would go there and deliberately hid. But who knew, you boy never went there, making me worry for nothing.\"\n\n\"Ice Moon City?\" Nian Bing looked at Chaji in surprise. He never imagined his master was so close to him. He looked at Chaji with helplessness, what else could he say but a bitter smile?\n\nIt turned out that after Nian Bing burned down the wooden house in the Peach Blossom Forest as Chaji had instructed and left, Chaji had also quietly left. With his unparalleled culinary skills, even with severed tendons in his hands and feet, he could secure a high position in any restaurant, simply by giving a few pointers that would benefit ordinary chefs immensely.\n\nBack then, Chaji had retired in seclusion after losing a bet to Bing Jie and severing his own meridians. The reason he chose the Peach Blossom Forest was because it was close to the Ice God Tower, where the Ice Snow Goddess Priest resided. He had visited the Ice God Tower more than once but had never dared to go in to find Bing Jie. After he retired, he did resent Bing Jie for deceiving his feelings at first. But after a few years, as his emotions gradually calmed down, he recalled his time with Bing Jie and realized that Bing Jie was not devoid of feelings for him. Especially the moment they parted, he could never forget it. With this conviction, his hatred gradually faded. After all, their entire relationship could be attributed to fate playing tricks. However, the Ice God Tower was a most sacred place in the Ice Moon Empire; any ordinary mage there could easily take his life. He was also well aware of the rules of the Ice God Tower. Therefore, he had never dared to go to the Ice God Tower to find Bing Jie, and could only live in seclusion in the Peach Blossom Forest.\n\nLater, after Nian Bing had finished his apprenticeship and left, another reason Chaji let Nian Bing believe he was dead was that he had made up his mind to go to the Ice God Tower alone. With this resolve, he had only one goal: to see Bing Jie one last time. When he arrived at the Ice God Tower, he directly requested an audience with the Ice Snow Goddess Priest. Originally, for an old man and a chef like him, how easy could it be to meet the Ice Snow Goddess Priest? However, the Ice Snow Goddess Priest at that time was Bing Jie herself! When she heard that an elderly chef was requesting an audience, her heart was filled with hope, so she met Chaji. When she truly saw the man she had deeply loved and deeply hurt years ago, Bing Jie used immense willpower to suppress her emotions from showing. Chaji asked to see Bing Jie, proposing his last request in life with great hope, even willing to pay with his life to fulfill this final wish. Bing Jie's heart was shattered. But she truly dared not face Chaji in her true form.\n\nAfter so many years, Chaji had come to understand the grievances between them. How could she not understand? She knew Chaji had never done anything wrong, but she had deeply hurt him. At that time, Bing Jie only wanted to defeat Chaji once and then live with him in private. But Chaji was proud and spirited. When he learned that the woman he deeply loved had deceived him, he chose an extreme path. Seeing him sever the tendons in his hands and feet, Bing Jie knew then that this hatred could not be resolved. Seeing the man she deeply loved again in the Ice God Tower, what could she do? She lacked the courage to face him! Just as Chaji had never had the courage to come to the Ice God Tower to find her back then. Therefore, she could only suppress her inner excitement and tell Chaji that Bing Jie was sealed in the Ice God Tower and could not receive outsiders. If not for fearing that Chaji would be too stimulated and unable to bear it, she probably would have told Chaji directly that Bing Jie was dead.\n\nHowever, Chaji was already resigned to death at that time and refused to leave. To allow him to live well, Bing Jie could only tell him to settle down in Ice Moon City, and after Bing Jie's transgressions were purified through meditation, she would allow Bing Jie to visit him in Ice Moon City one last time.\n\nAs expected, with this spiritual support, Chaji regained the hope of living. Thus, he settled down in that hotel in Ice Moon City, guiding the chefs there with his culinary skills while silently waiting. He only hoped to see his beloved woman one more time, and this final hope had sustained him in living in Ice Moon City.\n\nTherefore, when Bing Jie left the Ice God Tower, although Nian Bing and Bing Ling were filled with worry, Bing Jie easily found Chaji. At that time, she no longer had any burdens in her heart. After they met, Bing Jie only said one sentence to Chaji: she said she would use the rest of her life to compensate for everything she had done to Chaji.\n\nChaji finally got his wish. Although the age difference and Bing Jie's powerful strength made them look more like a father and daughter, they were together regardless of what others thought. If Nian Bing had seen Chaji before he met Bing Jie, he would have felt deep sorrow because Chaji at that time had become like a flickering candle, on the verge of death. However, after his wish was fulfilled and he was finally with the woman he loved most, happiness made him spirited. Chaji's body miraculously improved, and under Bing Jie's care, he became healthier and stronger.\n\nNot long ago, Bing Ling tentatively used a crystal ball to communicate, wanting to ask her senior sister to help Nian Bing as well. She directly contacted Bing Jie. Chaji and Bing Jie had already reunited. From Bing Jie, he learned much about Nian Bing. He no longer needed to hide anything from his only disciple. Therefore, this time he accompanied Bing Jie to the Lost Continent to see his disciple and also to allow Bing Jie to help Nian Bing and resist foreign enemies together.\n\nAfter listening to everything his master said, Nian Bing was filled with excitement and joy. He was genuinely happy for his master! Although so many years had passed, it was a wonderful thing for lovers to finally be together. Even in his dreams, Nian Bing wished for this scene to appear. At the same time, his master's arrival also strengthened Nian Bing's confidence. He no longer had anything to worry about or be concerned about. Looking at his master's kind gaze, Nian Bing's heart stirred slightly, and he had made a decision.\n\nChaji recounted his experiences after leaving, and everyone quickly flew towards Ice Moon Lake. By now, everyone who needed to be there had arrived. It was also time to rendezvous with the remaining refugees.\n\nNian Bing and Chaji, master and disciple, were reunited after a long separation. Chaji sat with Nian Bing on Oscar's back, partly to reminisce with his disciple and partly because he wanted to experience the feeling of riding on a dragon's back. These days, Bing Jie's magic had already brought him many surprises, and now his disciple had become a Dragon Mage, filling the heart of this former Ghost Chef with pride.\n\n\"Master, what are your plans now?\" Nian Bing asked with a smile. Chaji sat in front of him, carefully protected by Nian Bing's Sky Eye domain, so there was no need to worry about anything.\n\nChaji smiled slightly, sighed, and said, \"What other plans could I have? I'd be content to spend the rest of my life with your master-mother. So many years have passed, and your master-mother has also suffered a lot. We are finally free from our spiritual torment, and we have you, this kid, to thank. If it weren't for your battle with her, perhaps she still wouldn't have made up her mind. And I, your master, might not have held on until she awakened!\"\n\nNian Bing tightly clasped his master's frail but broad hand and said, \"Master, it was just a coincidence. Why thank each other? If I had known earlier that she was master-mother, I would have gone to plead for you long ago. Perhaps this is fate. Now you can finally enjoy your life. Master, your vital energy doesn't seem very strong. Do you feel uncomfortable in any way?\" While chatting with Chaji, he carefully examined Chaji's body. Chaji's health was very poor due to his advanced age and the mental torment of past years.\n\nChaji smiled slightly and patted Nian Bing's hand. \"Master knows his body best. Although I took good care of myself to see your master-mother, my mood has been very low all these years. I'm afraid I won't be around for much longer. Child, this time your master isn't faking death. After I'm gone, if you have time, please help me take good care of your master-mother. She's also quite pitiful. I hope she can experience family warmth. If possible, let her live with your parents or with you, okay?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"No, of course not. Master, you don't know, your disciple has three wives now. If you let master-mother live with us, wouldn't that disrupt our lives?\"\n\nChaji was stunned. He never expected Nian Bing to say that, and his expression changed slightly. \"Nian Bing, you brat...\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled and said, \"Master, listen to me first! Even if I agreed to let master-mother live with us, without you, what would it be called a home? Do you think master-mother could be happy if she lost you again? Even if her magic could grant her a long life, she would probably give it up. Perhaps she would even follow you to the underworld to be husband and wife again. Therefore, only you can give master-mother family warmth. Only by living together can master-mother be truly happy!\"\n\nChaji said with a bitter smile, \"Didn't I tell you that Master knows his own body best? To be honest with you, my condition is already close to the last flicker of life. Don't look at me as if nothing is wrong, but according to my own estimation, I'll be finished within a year at most. You smelly brat, this is Master's only wish, can't you help me?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Master, I said, only you can help yourself, not me. And only you can bring happiness to master-mother, not me. You might be wrong about one thing. You said you know your body best. But I can tell you with certainty that you absolutely don't know your body's condition as well as I do. You just said you can only live for a year at most, but that's actually incorrect. Judging by the vital energy and the condition of your internal organs, you'll be gone within half a year.\"\n\nChaji's expression changed slightly, and his ruddy complexion became somewhat pale. Did he want to die? The woman he loved had finally put aside all reservations and returned to his side, and before he could even enjoy the happiness, he was about to leave this world. How could he bear it? But life wouldn't extend according to one's will. Chaji's expression became increasingly grim, but he was surprised to find that his only disciple, his beloved disciple, was still smiling at this moment. A hint of faint disappointment showed, and Chaji said calmly, \"Then forget it. Since you're unwilling to help me, I won't force you.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Chaji's expression and knew he was angry. After living together for eight years, didn't he know what kind of person his master was? He chuckled and said, \"Master, you scared me when you pretended to be dead last time. This time, it's not excessive for me to make you angry once, right? Alright, don't be angry anymore.\"\n\nChaji was exasperated and said, \"You damn brat, you're still holding a grudge against your master.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Do you know how heartbroken I was back then? It's already quite good that I can make you a little disappointed this time.\"",

    "content": "Zha Ji looked at Nian Bing with some annoyance. \"I'm practically a dead man, and you're still provoking me. Do you think I'm not dying fast enough?\" Although Nian Bing's appearance made him angry, he vaguely felt that his only disciple wasn't as he appeared.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, put his arm around Zha Ji's shoulders, and said, \"Alright, Master, we're finally reunited. This time, you won't be able to die even if you wanted to. With your disciple here, how can I let you die?\"\n\nZha Ji was startled, his heart filled with joy, but he quickly frowned. \"What do you mean by that? Are you trying to anger me again? I know my condition better than anyone. Your Mistress also examined me thoroughly. Although she doesn't say anything, I can see that her judgment is the same as mine. You know your Mistress's magical skill best. Since she thinks so, is there any hope for me? You rascal, if you tease me again, I'll, I'll...\"\n\nNian Bing grabbed the hand pointing at him, his eyes filled with genuine emotion. \"Master, you've dedicated almost your entire life to culinary arts. Now that you're old, it's time for you to enjoy life. Heaven won't take your life. Even if heaven truly wants to take you, it will have to step over my corpse. Just because your Mistress can't cure you doesn't mean I can't. Although we are both magicians, our abilities are completely different. Master, don't worry, as long as I have a breath left in me, I will make you bloom like a spring flower. When we reach Ice Moon Lake, before we depart, I will first help you solve this important problem.\"\n\nZha Ji stared blankly at Nian Bing, feeling the resolve in his disciple's words. Only then did he realize that Nian Bing's constant smile was because he had a way to cure him. A warmth surged in his heart, and he couldn't speak as he looked at his disciple.\n\nNian Bing turned his head to glance at Bing Jie, who was following not far behind, talking with his parents. He whispered to Zha Ji, \"Master, do you want to have a little junior brother? Hehe.\"\n\nZha Ji was stunned, his old face instantly flushing red. He said angrily, \"What are you talking about, you rascal? You're getting more and more indecent.\"\n\nNian Bing whispered, \"Master, don't be shy, I'm being serious.\"\n\nZha Ji secretly glanced at Bing Jie behind them and lowered his voice. \"You rascal, you've really spoken to my heart. I'm already very satisfied to have you as my disciple in this life. My only regret is not having descendants. Don't laugh, but your Master is still a virgin. Although my health isn't good, I can still get an erection occasionally in the morning. But with my current condition, is it still possible?\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Nothing is impossible. Master, just wait and see your disciple's abilities. You raised me for eight years, taught me for eight years! Now it's time for your disciple to repay you. One night, just tonight, and tomorrow I'll make you bloom like a spring flower and regain your vigor. How about that? Your disciple isn't bad, right?\"\n\nFortunately, Zha Ji was old, and his face was wrinkled, so his blushing wasn't very apparent. He really wished he could find a crack in the ground to crawl into, but unfortunately, they were in mid-air. However, Nian Bing's words completely resonated with him. How he wished he could truly be with the woman he loved! Back when he first got together with Bing Jie, he had always respected her. Although there had been opportunities, he had always maintained his decorum. Therefore, he and Bing Jie were still virgins, which was also why the Ice Goddess Priestess had chosen Bing Jie to inherit her abilities. At this moment, although he dared not believe everything Nian Bing said, his heart yearned for it all to be true. His eyes were filled with expectation as he looked at his disciple, showing a hint of gratitude.\n\nNian Bing tightly gripped his master's hand, the smile on his face disappearing. He whispered, \"Master, as long as you can be happy, your disciple will be content. Don't worry, magic has many forms, and what I possess now is not just magic. I've already thought of a way, and I have over ninety percent certainty of success. At worst, I can extend your life by ten years.\"\n\nZha Ji looked deeply at Nian Bing and suddenly said, \"Rascal, are you harming yourself by helping me like this? If so, then forget it. Master is old, but you are still young.\"\n\nSeeing the concern in Zha Ji's eyes, Nian Bing smiled and shook his head. \"Master, don't worry, this won't harm me at all. You might not know, but I also died once, and I still came back to life. Don't worry, I have a plan. After I restore your body, we'll set off on our journey. I promise you, as long as I'm alive, I will protect your Mistress.\"\n\nZha Ji's eyes welled up. \"Ten years, ten years is enough. To be able to enjoy ten years is already the greatest gift from heaven. Nian Bing, I...\"\n\nNian Bing interrupted Zha Ji. \"Master, you actually have another wish, a wish that you most want to fulfill, but your disciple has not been able to help you with it.\"\n\nZha Ji nodded. \"You're talking about the Culinary God Competition, right? It's okay, I have confidence in you. How could the disciple of Ghost Chef be bad? You will eventually get what you deserve. However, I heard that the new Culinary God is also very strong. You need to keep working hard.\"\n\nA sharp glint flashed in Nian Bing's eyes. \"Master, your wish is not just for me to win the Culinary God Competition, but also to find the true pinnacle of culinary arts. Don't worry, after things here are settled, I will definitely help you fulfill this wish.\"\n\nAs the afterglow of the setting sun slowly disappeared in the west, everyone finally returned to the shores of Ice Moon Lake. The residual light of the setting sun cast a crimson glow in the sky, reflecting on the rippling water below, creating an indescribably moving scene.\n\nBing Ling's eyes revealed a misty brilliance. \"It's so beautiful, Nian Bing. Is this all your doing?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"I have no credit for this. It's mostly the result of the hard work of the magic experts from the Ice God Tower and Brother Xi Lu. After continuous reclamation these days, centered around Ice Moon Lake, we now have a sizable area of farmland, enough to feed the army here. As the farmland expands, we can undertake larger-scale development of the Lost Continent. I believe this continent once had a glorious past, and we will surely not lack the various minerals we need here. Perhaps in ten years, perhaps in a hundred, as long as we solve the problem of the gods, this continent will surely prosper. I firmly believe this.\"\n\nSeeing the confidence in his son's eyes, Rong Tian smiled. \"Nian Bing, do you know? Before I met your mother, I also had many grand ideals and ambitions. I wanted to become the most outstanding magician of the Rong family, to lead the army to unify the continent. Although I achieved none of it, I have no regrets, because I obtained the most precious thing, which is your mother's love. That is enough for me. And now, my aspirations from back then have been realized in you. Father did not fulfill his responsibilities, but I will always be proud of you. I firmly believe that we will be able to stop the invasion of those gods on this continent and help the Lost Continent rebuild its civilization and create new glory.\"\n\nBing Jie walked to Nian Bing and Zha Ji and whispered to Zha Ji, \"What were you two whispering about just now?\" Looking at Bing Jie's almost beautiful face and near-perfect figure, and remembering Nian Bing's earlier mention of regaining vigor, Zha Ji's already desperate heart ignited with warmth.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"Mistress, I will definitely give you a surprise tomorrow morning. Now that everyone is here, I'll arrange our departure first, and then I need to have a good talk with Master.\" After saying that, he arranged accommodations for his parents and Zha Ji and his wife, and then immediately summoned Luo Rou and Mu Jing, instructing them to have the army begin its movement.\n\nThe space magic array had been constructed before Nian Bing's three days of cultivation. Now, all that was needed was the input of magical power. He told Mu Jing and Luo Rou to go ahead and meet the Dragon Kings, and he would join them tomorrow morning.\n\nMu Jing and Luo Rou went to prepare the army to march towards the space magic array Nian Bing had constructed, while Nian Bing himself went to the stone house where Prince Rong resided. The main force of the Huayong Empire had arrived, and Prince Rong's status was naturally not comparable to Mu Jing and Luo Rou. Towards his own grandfather, Nian Bing could only use polite means. Moreover, with his father now returned, it was time to speak up for them.\n\nJust now, as Rong Tian spoke of his pride in his son, a hint of regret was clearly evident in his eyes. Nian Bing understood what that was. Although he had said nothing at the time, father and son were connected by heart, so how could he not help his father fulfill this greatest wish?\n\nAfter lightly tapping on the door a few times, Prince Rong's voice came from inside, \"Who is it?\"\n\n\"Grandfather, it's me, Nian Bing,\" Nian Bing replied respectfully. His grandfather's voice sounded calm, yet still so deep and powerful.\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\nNian Bing pushed the door open and entered. As soon as he stepped inside, he saw that the room was filled with members of the Rong family, including Prince Rong's two younger brothers, his own eldest uncle Rong Yue, and his elder brother Rong Bing. Most of them already knew about Nian Bing, but seeing him face-to-face, with a similar appearance to Rong Bing, they couldn't help but show surprise. Only Rong Yue and his son Rong Bing offered Nian Bing warm smiles.\n\n\"Grandfather,\" Nian Bing walked forward and paid his respects to his grandfather. He didn't even look at his two grand-uncles beside him.\n\nPrince Rong nodded. \"It's time to set off, isn't it?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Yes, it's about time. The earlier we arrive and prepare, the more advantageous the situation will be.\"\n\nPrince Rong said, \"I've also made my preparations. We'll make arrangements when we get there. This time, all of the Rong family's elites are here, a total of one thousand one hundred and twenty-three fire element magicians, plus two elite knight orders. As for the ordinary soldiers, I've only selected the most elite part; the rest will remain here to continue the development.\"\n\nNian Bing naturally understood Prince Rong's meaning. In battles of that level, even elite soldiers would likely only become cannon fodder, let alone ordinary soldiers.\n\nPrince Rong continued, \"My people are all ready. When we get there, if you need to make any arrangements, you can simply have someone come and notify us. Rest assured, this time, we are facing a common enemy. The three countries of Bing Yue, Lang Mu, and Ao Lan are merely our allies, not enemies.\"\n\nWith Prince Rong's words, it was equivalent to giving Nian Bing a shot of confidence, dispelling his last remaining concerns. He smiled slightly and said, \"Alright, let's depart now. I've already prepared the space magic array.\"\n\nPrince Rong glanced at his grandson. \"Can your magic array support so many people crossing? The load must be immense.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly. Although his gaze was peaceful, his entire being exuded immense confidence. \"Grandfather, don't worry, this two-way spatial teleportation magic array can absorb spatial magic elements from the air. No matter how many people pass through, there will be no problem. Furthermore, I've also set up a guardian magic array within the magic array, so even the weakest ordinary person will not be affected during the crossing.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, everyone in the room was astonished. Although Nian Bing said it casually, most of the people present were the most outstanding magicians on the Yangguang Continent, so how could they not understand the difficulty? A two-way, long-distance instant teleportation magic array alone was already a lost art. Moreover, Nian Bing was able to supplement this magic array with other magic arrays to enhance the overall stability of the formation, and it also possessed the ability to absorb spatial magic elements on its own. With these combined abilities, none of the magicians present could achieve it, not even Prince Rong. They naturally understood the importance of magic arrays to magicians. At this moment, they had to re-evaluate Nian Bing's strength.\n\nFeeling the surprised gazes of everyone, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. What he wanted to express to everyone was that as a descendant of the Rong family, he would never bring shame to the Rong family.\n\n\"Grandfather, there is one more thing I need to report to you.\" Nian Bing seemed determined to make a statement, and his words once again captured the attention of the Rong family experts.",

    "content": "Prince Rong looked at Nian Bing in surprise and asked, \"There's one more thing, what is it?\"\n\nNian Bing hesitated slightly, but his eyes quickly cleared. \"My father has returned, along with my mother. They are now by Ice Moon Lake.\"\n\nIf his explanation of the magic array had surprised the Rong family experts present, then this statement caused all the Rong family experts to erupt. A flurry of complex and angry discussions filled the large stone room. Although they had silently acknowledged Nian Bing's identity, Rong Tian was different. When Rong Tian left, he carried the crime of being a traitor! Moreover, he had also taken the Rong family's heirloom, the Stone of the Fire God, at that time. No one in the Rong family could forget this. Now, the Rong family experts, who had always thought Rong Tian was dead, were naturally shocked to hear he had returned.\n\nNian Bing calmly scanned the faces of the Rong family experts, most of whom had darkened. He didn't say much. Facing these people, he mostly felt contempt. He dared to say this in front of everyone because he wasn't afraid of anything. Even if all the Rong family members were to oppose his father, he was confident he could bear it alone and would never let his father suffer any harm. Furthermore, Prince Rong was in charge of the Rong family now. Feeling his father's affection for him, he understood that Prince Rong, as a father himself, could not truly be harsh towards his son. He also knew that once Prince Rong acknowledged him, he no longer harbored any hatred for his father. Therefore, his calm gaze was entirely fixed on his grandfather, who was the only one truly in charge of the Rong family.\n\nThe two younger brothers beside Prince Rong were about to speak but were stopped by a raised hand. Their imposing gazes swept down, instantly quieting the murmuring Rong family experts. Prince Rong's authority was something no one dared to defy, not even his brothers, let alone the younger generation below.\n\nA hint of emotion appeared in Prince Rong's eyes as he looked at Nian Bing and said, \"He has returned? No, it should be they have returned.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded firmly, \"Yes, they have returned, Grandfather. I want your answer.\"\n\nPrince Rong certainly knew what Nian Bing wanted. Nian Bing could see his grandfather's body tremble slightly. Although this was a very small detail, it further solidified Nian Bing's own thoughts.\n\n\"Come back. How can the descendants of the Rong family be left to wander outside? Tell Rong Tian to rejoin the Rong family before the army departs. Rong Yue.\"\n\n\"Here,\" Rong Yue quickly stood up from his father's position. The excitement in his eyes was even more intense than Prince Rong's. Nian Bing and Rong Bing were close. How could he not be close to his own brother? They were twin brothers! Twins inherently have a spiritual connection. When Nian Bing mentioned he had something to tell Prince Rong earlier, he had already guessed some of it. He was now eager to meet his own brother.\n\nPrince Rong took a deep breath and said, \"Rong Tian left home that year and took the Stone of the Fire God. His crime was unforgivable, but the situation is tense now, and internal strife within the Rong family cannot continue. Therefore, Rong Tian is permitted to return to the Rong family to atone for his sins through merit.\"\n\n\"Big Brother, this is not permissible,\" his second brother interjected. \"Big Brother, Rong Tian committed a grave offense. How can he be allowed to return to the family so easily? Moreover, he also took the family's Stone of the Fire God. According to family rules, he should...\"\n\n\"Should what? The Stone of the Fire God is here.\" Nian Bing's eyes flashed with cold light. The Roar of the Fire God flew out with a flickering red glow and landed on the floor in front of him. A scorching aura emanated from the blade, instantly making the fire element in the stone room surge. Even though the Rong family experts present had seen countless treasures, as their gazes fell upon the Stone of the Fire God and they felt the surging fire element, their eyes revealed greed.\n\nNian Bing's gaze fixed on his second uncle, and he said calmly, \"The Stone of the Fire God has always been in my possession. It wasn't my father who took it back then; I stole it. If you have any issues, take them up with me. I will accept them all. If you want to deal with me according to family rules, you can. However, I once heard Grandfather say that those who make special contributions to the clan can be exempted from punishment according to family rules. I believe you all know this. Of course, there's another family rule that states that although those with merit can be exempted from punishment for their mistakes, if anyone in the clan disagrees, they can challenge them. If they win, their crime can be determined. I am not wrong, am I? I am willing to accept anyone's challenge, at any time.\"\n\nFeeling the dominance emanating from Nian Bing, the direct descendants of Prince Rong's two brothers all stood up abruptly, glaring at him. Prince Rong's second brother said disdainfully, \"You took it? How old were you then? You say you've contributed to the clan? How come I don't know? Do you intend to challenge everyone in the Rong family by yourself?\"\n\nRong Yue said from the side, \"Second Uncle, what you're saying is wrong. Even if there's a challenge, it doesn't include my line. Nian Bing can be considered my child. If he makes any mistakes, I am willing to bear them for him.\"\n\nNian Bing looked gratefully at his eldest uncle, who bore an eight or nine-tenths resemblance to his father, and smiled. \"Eldest Uncle, thank you, but I don't think it's necessary. The clan knows my contributions to it. As for challenges, I am willing to accept anyone's challenge, but I'm afraid you won't dare to challenge me.\" At this moment, he knew he shouldn't stir up trouble, and dealing with the divine beings was more important. However, the resentment that had accumulated in his heart for years could not be suppressed. He was not only standing up for his father but also for himself. The indifference his grandfather showed towards his father back then was closely related to these people. If it weren't for the pressure from the clan, his grandfather might not have treated his father so coldly.\n\nPrince Rong roared, \"Sit down, all of you! Do you still have me, the clan leader, in your eyes?\"\n\nFacing the majesty of the Blood Lion King, all the Rong family members sat down. Prince Rong gave them a cold look and said, \"Although what Nian Bing said is to cover for his father, the son paying for the father's sins is not impossible. He is willing to take the blame for his father, and I agree. Nian Bing has made great contributions to the clan, so his merits and demerits can offset each other. I permit him to possess the Stone of the Fire God. According to the clan rules, you have the right to challenge him. However, I will warn you all first: the Rong family's top expert is not me, but Nian Bing standing before you. Rong Yue, go and bring Rong Tian.\"\n\n\"Yes, Father.\" Seeing the changing expressions of his second and third uncles, Rong Yue couldn't help but feel immense satisfaction as he turned to leave.\n\nThe people present clearly could not accept this fact. None of them could believe that this young man, who was only in his early twenties, was the Rong family's top expert. However, they couldn't doubt Prince Rong's words, because Prince Yong had never lied before, and never would in the future. Therefore, they hesitated.\n\n\"Big Brother, Nian Bing may have the strongest ability, but I don't know how the contributions you mentioned were made.\"\n\nPrince Rong glanced at the displeased eyes of his two brothers and said coldly, \"This is the clan's greatest secret, and you do not need to know it. Do you doubt my words as well?\"\n\n\"No, of course, we do not doubt your words. However, he is your direct grandson, and people are bound to be...\"\n\nA cold light flashed in Prince Rong's eyes, and just as he was about to speak, the stone room door opened. It wasn't Rong Yue bringing back Rong Tian; he had only just left, and there was no way he could return so quickly. Seven people walked in from outside. Seven elders, each wearing the most ordinary clothes, but their arrival caused everyone present to stand up.\n\nThe Seven Elders of the Blood Lion were not only the seven elders of the Blood Lion Sect with the highest decision-making power, but they were also the seven elders with the highest seniority in the Rong family. Normally, they lived in seclusion in the most peaceful inner courtyard of the Rong family, and their strength was enough to earn the most sincere respect from all Rong family members. Moreover, among them were not only Prince Rong's father but also the fathers of his two brothers.\n\nThe second elder glared at his son and said, \"Rong Yan is the clan leader of this clan. His words are commands to anyone in this clan. Do you intend to defy heaven? If you don't trust him, don't you trust me either? We are here to say only one thing: Nian Bing's contributions to the clan are unparalleled, not just by you, but by any of the Rong family's ancestors. Let alone atoning for his father, with his merits, it would be acceptable even if he were made the clan leader now. Anyone who has an objection is desecrating the clan's ancestors. Alright, you two, hurry up and prepare.\" Prince Rong's second and third brothers were the sons of this second elder. If you were to ask who they feared most in their lives, it wouldn't be Prince Rong, who always overshadowed them, but this short-tempered father.\n\nAt that moment, everyone's doubts reached their peak, but they no longer dared to utter a word of objection.\n\nNian Bing waved his right hand, retracting the Roar of the Fire God into his body, and smiled calmly. \"I'm afraid it will be difficult for everyone present to be convinced of me, but one must rely on strength when speaking. We are about to face the strongest group of people in this world. At that time, I will show you what true power is. I know that many of you have hostility towards my father and me. This is unavoidable, but I have grown up now, and what happened in my childhood will not happen again.\"\n\nThe eldest elder walked to Nian Bing's side, his eyes filled with a benevolent glow. He knew very well what Nian Bing had been through. Looking at his great-grandson, he sighed softly and said, \"Alright, Nian Bing, there's no need to say so much. You still have many things to do. Go now. The Hua Rong Imperial Army is about to depart. As for your father, you can rest assured, your grandfather is here.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, bowed respectfully to the seven elders and his grandfather, and then retreated. If he were at the Blood Lion Sect, only the seven elders would bow to him. But here, the seven elders were his elders.\n\nUpon leaving the stone room, Nian Bing knew that with the seven elders and his grandfather present, his father would not face any difficulties. He had too many things to do and couldn't stay there any longer. His figure flickered several times, and he arrived at the spatial teleportation magic array he had constructed with the fastest speed. It was time for the array to demonstrate its power.\n\nWhen Nian Bing returned to his room, it was already late at night. Ice Moon Lake was much quieter after the departure of the four imperial armies. The slightly damp air caressed everything. A hint of fatigue appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. Helping so many people traverse space, although the magic array could absorb the innate qi from the air, transporting two hundred thousand people at once was still somewhat difficult, so he had to use his spiritual power to assist. At this time, the depletion of his spiritual power had made him somewhat tired. However, he still had things to do and couldn't rest at all.\n\nIf it weren't for his master's sudden appearance, Nian Bing would have appeared before the exiled inhabitants of the Lost Continent like the soldiers of the four empires. But his master's condition was so poor; if he didn't help Cha Ji resolve the problem first, he wouldn't be able to face the divine beings with peace of mind. Therefore, he decided to stay, and only Bing Jie stayed with him. Even Feng Nu, Lan Chen, and Long Ling had gone to the front lines. As for his father, he had successfully returned to the Rong family. Although Nian Bing hadn't seen his father again, he firmly believed that his father must be very happy now, as his greatest wish had finally been resolved. And although his mother was temporarily separated from his father, she led the experts of the Ice God Tower. All the elites of the four empires had already gone.\n\n\"Master,\" Nian Bing pushed the door open and called out softly.\n\nEven though it was late at night, Cha Ji had not slept. It wasn't that he didn't want to sleep, but he simply couldn't. The thought of his outstanding disciple, and what Nian Bing had told him during the day, made his heart burn with emotion. Bing Jie had just left a moment ago. Cha Ji, fearing she was too tired, had told her to rest. After all, Bing Jie would also be rushing to the front lines with Nian Bing tomorrow.\n\n\"You're back. You must be tired. Rest for a while,\" Cha Ji smiled and patted the chair beside him.\n\nNian Bing walked over and sat down beside his master. In front of his master, he no longer needed to display any strength. He looked at Cha Ji with a smile and said, \"Master, the environment here is quite good, isn't it? If you and Mistress wish to live in seclusion in the future, this would be a good choice. Ice Moon City is indeed a bit too cold.\"",

    "content": "Cha Ji smiled faintly, \"No rush. If I can truly survive, where I choose to live in seclusion makes no difference. Nian Bing, you look too tired. You haven't rested since returning. Why don't you get some rest first? We can discuss this after you've defeated the God-Man. Then we can talk.\"\n\nNian Bing knew that Cha Ji cared about him. He took his master's weak but broad hand and smiled, \"Master, I'm not tired. If I don't help you recover your health, how can I leave with peace of mind? You and Mistress have finally reunited. For your happiness, you absolutely cannot have any trouble! I'm not tired at all. Your disciple is now one of the strongest humans on the continent. Although I'm a bit busy, my body is perfectly fine. Let's begin. Otherwise, I fear I won't be able to finish by morning.\"\n\nLooking at the sincere light in Nian Bing's eyes, Cha Ji smiled, \"Back when your Mistress Chun Nai Sheng had that problem, I always thought the most correct thing I ever did was to boldly pursue your Mistress. Even after that incident separated us, I always believed that. But now, I realize I did something even more correct: I took you as my disciple. Nian Bing, your performance has been too outstanding. In your master's eyes, you have no flaws.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"Master, if you keep praising me like this, I'll get a big head. In reality, how could I possibly be perfect? For the past two years, I've been busy with improving my strength and dealing with unavoidable events. My culinary skills haven't been cultivated further. In fact, magic was initially just a means to rescue my parents. What I truly love is cooking! To not be able to strive for my own preferences, perhaps that is my sorrow too. But rest assured, as long as I can survive this great battle and return, I will go all out with Xiao Tian in the next Culinary God competition. Even if I lose, I won't tarnish your reputation.\"\n\nCha Ji laughed heartily, \"No, you must win. How could my disciple possibly lose? In fact, when I heard the description from the people returning from the hotel I was staying at, I knew Xiao Tian's background.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned, \"You know his background? He is...\"\n\nCha Ji smiled, \"Silly boy, think about it. Without an outstanding master, how could he have trained such an outstanding disciple? Of course, he has a background. Do you remember the Five Culinary Gods I told you about? I was always ranked first. Among the other four Culinary Gods, one actually had a difference in strength with me that was extremely minute. That was the second-ranked Fiery Culinary God. Because of this ranking, he was always resentful, continuously cultivating his culinary skills. But even on the day I retired from the culinary world, he still couldn't defeat me.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned as he looked at his master, \"But I've never heard you mention the Fiery Culinary God's 'Yin Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand' before. That is the foremost divine hand in the culinary world. Xiao Tian is able to contend with me precisely because of this Yin Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand. To be precise, his Culinary God status is likely also thanks to the Yin Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand. If he is the Fiery Culinary God's disciple, with the Yin Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand, perhaps the Fiery Culinary God wouldn't have lost to you back then.\"\n\nCha Ji smiled slightly, \"That's right, the Fiery Culinary God doesn't know the Yin Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand. Perhaps you've already guessed. In fact, the Yin Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand doesn't originate from culinary arts, but from martial arts. Old Lie wouldn't know any martial arts, of course. But that doesn't mean his disciple wouldn't. I don't know the exact situation, but I can vaguely guess that this fellow found a disciple with excellent talent, hired a martial arts master to teach him martial arts, and then passed on the Yin Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand for him to cultivate. Back then, when I defeated Old Lie for the last time, I heard him say that he had a treasure that I couldn't defeat, but that treasure wasn't ready for use yet. Now, I think the treasure he was referring to must be this Yin Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand. It's a shame he couldn't cultivate it himself, so he never used it. Now, he has passed this foremost divine hand in the culinary world to his disciple, and his disciple has, as wished, obtained the position of Culinary God. I imagine he must be secretly rejoicing.\"\n\nNian Bing asked, \"You mean, the Fiery Culinary God originally had the cultivation method for the Yin Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand?\"\n\nCha Ji nodded, \"Exactly. I am almost certain that he either inherited it or accidentally obtained the cultivation method for the Yin Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand. He only later discovered that it required practitioners of martial arts to cultivate the Yin Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand, and he was already too old. Therefore, he could only place his hopes on the next generation. Although Xiao Tian has obtained the position of Culinary God, as long as he hasn't defeated my disciple, he will never be the true Culinary God.\" As he spoke, the former titan of the culinary world showed pride in his eyes. After all, in his era, no one could surpass him, and even Bing Jie only won through trickery.\n\n\"Master, I will definitely work hard. There are still a few years left. I think that should be enough. Alright, we should begin. Master, let me show you something first. I think you'll be very surprised.\" While speaking, Nian Bing smiled and took out a porcelain bottle from his spatial ring, handing it to Cha Ji. \"Master, drink a sip first, and then we'll start.\"\n\nTaking the porcelain bottle, Cha Ji suddenly felt a strange impulse. After glancing at Nian Bing, he carefully pulled out the stopper. Immediately, a refreshing fragrance filled every corner of the room. The scent seemed to change every second, but no matter how it changed, it was always so magical.\n\n\"Ah! This, this is Hundred Flower Dew. How is it possible? How could anyone brew Hundred Flower Dew!\" Cha Ji's voice trembled. His excitement instantly reached its peak. Although he was once the most outstanding chef, there were still some things he couldn't do, like brewing Hundred Flower Dew. The biggest difficulty in brewing Hundred Flower Dew was gathering a hundred varieties of rare flowers from all four seasons. Cha Ji had tried before, but no matter where he went on the continent, he couldn't gather so many types of flowers, let alone flowers from all four seasons. Of course, a hundred common flowers could be gathered, but the preciousness of the flowers themselves, along with the special requirement of the four seasons, determined the quality of the Hundred Flower Dew. It was for this reason that, despite Cha Ji's unremitting efforts, he eventually had to give up. But the rich fragrance before him was clearly the highest quality Hundred Flower Dew! How could he not be astonished?\n\nNian Bing pointed at himself and smiled, \"Master, your disciple, I, am the one who brewed the Hundred Flower Dew! I put in a lot of effort to succeed. Of course, this can only be achieved in a special place. And the treatment I'm about to perform for you today is related to this special place. Drink a sip first, and then we'll begin.\"\n\nCha Ji trembled as he brought the porcelain bottle to his lips and took a small sip. He naturally knew how precious Hundred Flower Dew was and couldn't bear to drink much. Accompanied by a fragrant mist that spread to every pore, a warm sensation instantly permeated every part of his body. The warmth made his frail body feel as comfortable as if it had regained its youth. He couldn't help but groan, and his hand trembled, almost dropping the porcelain bottle. Fortunately, Nian Bing noticed in time and took the bottle.\n\nAll the flowers used in Hundred Flower Dew were the most precious flowers. Back in Kaos's life domain, these flowers were promoted by her immense life force. And this Hundred Flower Dew was the essence of the flowers, naturally possessing the purest life force. Under the influence of this life force, Cha Ji's constantly depleting vitality was gently replenished, instantly making him feel much more comfortable. His dull yellow eyes also became clearer.\n\nSeven-colored light appeared out of thin air. Cha Ji felt his entire body lighten. He was no longer sitting in the chair but was floating onto the bed. Under the effect of an unknown energy, he was surprised to find himself sitting in a cross-legged position. Nian Bing followed him onto the bed, gesturing with his hands to place Cha Ji's hands on his knees. He said seriously, \"Master, I'm about to begin. Just stabilize your mind and think of it as going to sleep. Tomorrow morning, the sun will definitely look different.\"\n\nLooking at the confidence in his disciple's eyes, Cha Ji suddenly realized that things he had always thought impossible now seemed not so difficult. A faint smile appeared on his aged face. He slowly closed his eyes. As an outstanding chef, stabilizing his mind was an easy task. As soon as he closed his eyes, he clearly felt a warmer force, stronger than Hundred Flower Dew, coming from his limbs and bones. In an instant, that warmth had engulfed him.\n\nIf anyone were in the room at this moment, they would be astonished to see a green light appear on Nian Bing's chest. This light emitted a soft green glow, and the life-infused energy formed a light shield that completely enveloped Cha Ji's body. Although Nian Bing couldn't truly use the energy of the Life Ball and Death Ball yet, he could utilize them simply. The life force, in a gentle stimulation, stirred the vitality within Cha Ji's body, causing his withered body to gradually emit a pale yellow glow. Streams of fresh life force entered his body through every pore, beginning to transform his body.\n\nNian Bing's hands gradually lit up. His left hand glowed with blue light, while his right hand radiated a soft milky white. As a magician, casting two healing spells simultaneously was incredibly difficult! After all, healing magic required much more precise control than offensive magic. Otherwise, if not done correctly, it could easily have the opposite effect. However, in Nian Bing's hands, both elemental healing magics were cast with ease. Under the effect of his vast mental power, there were no problems at all. Combined with the baptism of life force, he had begun the most powerful healing. Such a healing technique could probably even revive someone who had just died!\n\nThe light flickered, and a strong light appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. He brought his hands together in front of his chest. Under the control of his mental power, blue and white lights flowed into Cha Ji from his head and the soles of his feet, respectively. For his master, Nian Bing was not only extremely careful but also used his full strength. He didn't want to miss out on his master's recovery by even a little due to carelessness.\n\nThe night was silent. Bing Jie did not heed Cha Ji's words to rest. With her strength, sleeping or not had long ceased to be important. While Nian Bing was busy, Cha Ji had not hidden anything from her regarding Nian Bing's thoughts. Although she found it hard to believe, she couldn't help but feel a glimmer of hope when she thought about the miracles that had happened to Nian Bing before. At this moment, as Nian Bing was fully occupied helping Cha Ji recover, she was guarding outside. One reason was to protect them, and another was to witness firsthand how much her beloved could recover.\n\nBing Jie and Cha Ji's relationship had lasted for decades, and not even the slightest bit had changed. Even though she saw how aged Cha Ji was, she had no regrets or wavering in her feelings. She clearly understood Cha Ji's physical condition and only hoped he could live a few more days so she could serve him a few more days. That would be enough. She didn't dare to hope for Cha Ji's body to improve. After all, as a magician, she understood all too well what the loss of one's life force represented. But how could she know that Nian Bing was an anomaly? He, who had previously summoned powerful magic twice at the cost of his own life force, understood life force more profoundly than anyone. Moreover, he possessed the immense life force that ordinary people could only dream of!\n\nTime passed minute by minute. The humid air made Bing Jie's clothes slightly damp, but she stood there without moving an inch. In her heart, she was silently praying, praying that all of Nian Bing's efforts would succeed. Even if it only allowed Cha Ji to live a few more years, she would be content.\n\nThe night had turned a deep black. Wisps of mist diffused across the surface of Ice Moon Lake. Due to the mist, the bright moonlight appeared somewhat hazy. Bing Jie looked up at the sky. For many years, her heart had not been this nervous since she first saw Cha Ji. When people have no hope, they tend not to overthink things. However, when hope arrives, people's thoughts become more complex. Bing Jie was in such a state of mind right now.\n\nPlease vote, friends. Thank you.",

    "content": "Time passed incredibly slowly at this moment, as Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye domain prevented any aura or sound from escaping the room. Bing Jie waited silently. Even though her heart was unusually anxious, she dared not disturb him.\n\nWhen the eastern sky finally revealed a faint, fish-belly white, and the black sky began to turn blue, as the dawn's first light was about to arrive, Bing Jie suddenly noticed that, at some point, a layer of faint ice crystals had formed on her clothes. This was naturally not due to the environment; although the weather wasn't hot, it was already early spring. The appearance of ice was clearly due to her inadvertently released ice magic power reaching its peak. After cultivating for so many years, this was the first time she had lost control of her magic power to such an extent.\n\nThe sky grew brighter and brighter. The sun appeared on the distant horizon like a yolk from an egg. The gradually intensifying brilliance, carrying the aura of light, rose into the sky. It was an incredibly wonderful feeling, as if the earth itself was gradually awakening within the sunlight. The sounds of insects and birds gradually grew louder. With the reclamation of the Lost Continent, various creatures brought from the Yanggu Continent had gradually increased. Although most were just birds, they brought a bit more vitality to this continent that had lost its own civilization.\n\nThe door opened silently. The first to emerge was a fatigued Nian Bing. His face was calm, but the exhaustion of his energy consumption was hard to hide. His somewhat pale complexion made him look a little haggard. Looking at his expressionless face, Bing Jie's heart skipped a beat.\n\n\"Ah! Stepmother, why are you here?\" Nian Bing asked, surprised, looking at Bing Jie.\n\nBing Jie now was no longer the aloof Ice Goddess Priestess she used to be. She stammered, \"I... I was worried about you two, so I stayed outside guarding. Nian Bing, how is... how is your master?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. His smile, as warm as the sun, made Bing Jie's heart beat faster. Of course, she knew what such a smile represented. Just then, another figure emerged from the room.\n\nThis figure was only slightly shorter than Nian Bing. Every step he took was so steady. The ordinary cloth clothes he wore gave him a gentle aura. As soon as he appeared, he brought a faint, fresh scent to the surrounding air.\n\nBing Jie stared blankly at the tall figure before her, unable to believe it was real. Could this man with a strong build, handsome features, and who looked to be only in his thirties, really be him?\n\nCha Ji's eyes welled up with warmth. Although he couldn't see his face, he could clearly see the changes on his skin. His moist skin no longer had that lifeless feeling, nor any wrinkles. It was as if he had been reborn. Every minute detail of his body exuded vitality. What kind of feeling was this! His whole body felt light and airy, as if he had entered another world. The Ice Moon Lake before him seemed even more beautiful, and the large tracts of cultivated land around it were even greener. Cha Ji wanted to ask himself, is this still me?\n\nWhen Bing Jie first met Cha Ji, he was already forty years old. Although he possessed the aura of a mature man then, he was definitely not as handsome as he was now, with that gentle feeling. That handsome appearance, that majestic physique. Is this, is this the man she loved? Bing Jie wanted to rush forward and embrace him, but she couldn't be sure if all of this was real.\n\nNian Bing smiled, a happy smile. The fatigue in his body seemed to vanish at this moment. He looked at his master, reborn, with satisfaction. He felt an indescribable joy in his heart. No matter how much more he had to give, he wouldn't feel the slightest dissatisfaction. It was all worth it! This was a miracle he had created with his own hands.\n\nYes, it could only be described as a miracle. Cha Ji's aging body, under the combined effects of the water magic of the Source of Life, the gentle holy light magic, and the incomparably abundant vital energy, had not only recovered its vitality but also regained its youth. Now, his body was no different from that of an ordinary man in his thirties, and he also possessed immense vital energy. Let alone ten years, Cha Ji was now completely confident he could live for another hundred years.\n\nNian Bing looked at his Stepmother with a smile, \"Master is back, the real Master is back. Stepmother, I guess this counts as giving you closure. I believe you and Master will live the happiest life.\"\n\nBing Jie stared blankly at Nian Bing, her voice trembling, \"He, he really is...\"\n\nNian Bing nodded firmly, \"I watched Master slowly transform into his current state with my own eyes. Stepmother, embrace Master. He needs your affirmation now.\"\n\n\"Xiao Jie, I'm back. My life has returned. Now, it's not you who should be taking care of me, but I who will take care of you for the rest of my life.\" Cha Ji's voice was no longer as old as before. His deep voice carried a joy full of life. He took firm steps, walking towards the woman he loved. At this moment, his heart was filled with excitement.\n\nNian Bing watched the two figures gradually merge with a smile. He smiled, a happy smile. The excitement in his heart was like when his parents were first saved. This feeling was so wonderful, so touching. Nian Bing's heart trembled with this wonderful feeling. His gaze drifted into the distance. He knew that after resolving this matter, he no longer had any lingering concerns. The gods probably wouldn't give him much more time.\n\nOnly when she embraced Cha Ji's body, filled with vital energy, did Bing Jie truly confirm that all of this was real. Besides his original aura, Cha Ji's body also had a faint, fresh scent – the effect of the Hundred Flower Dew. Completely reborn, not only had his body fully recovered, but with Nian Bing's deliberate treatment, his severed hands and feet had also completely healed. Now, he was a complete person, without any defects compared to others.\n\nBing Jie cried, she cried with excitement. Lying in Cha Ji's arms, tears of happiness flowed. What could be happier than this moment? Cha Ji's embrace was so strong, his aura so familiar. Everything that had happened before was now forgotten.\n\nThe embrace felt as long as a century. When their bodies separated, there were no longer any tears on their faces. Holding hands, their four gazes fell upon the tired Nian Bing. Both of them unexpectedly bowed to Nian Bing at the same time.\n\nNian Bing was startled and, almost without hesitation, quickly jumped aside, saying flusteredly, \"Master, Stepmother, what are you doing? Do you want to shorten my lifespan?\"\n\nBing Jie looked at Nian Bing with immense gratitude, \"Thank you, Nian Bing, thank you so much. Without you, there would be no future for me and your Master. There's something I always forgot to tell you, actually. When I wanted Bing Yun to bring you back to the Ice God Tower, it was to let you see your parents. But you were like a slippery fish, impossible to catch, and in the end, you even tricked Bing Yun away.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at her in surprise, \"No way, Stepmother, you planned that? But I didn't trick Bing Yun! I truly love her.\"\n\nBing Jie smiled slightly, \"I don't know about that. At that time, although I couldn't disobey Master's orders and release Ice Spirit and her husband, it was possible to let you meet. Alright, your Master is fine now. We should go.\"\n\nNian Bing hesitated for a moment, \"Stepmother, you stay too. Just stay here to guard. It's best to have someone here in case those gods cunningly sneak over.\" He knew very well that Bing Jie's strength was a huge help to their side, but his Master's body had just recovered, how could he bear to separate them?\n\nCha Ji smiled slightly, \"Alright, I know what you're thinking, you brat. We bowed to you just now to thank you for giving us the rest of our lives. For that alone, you've repaid my paternal love! Let your Stepmother accompany you. Your Stepmother is the most important person in my life, and so are you. I hope you can both return safely. I'm just a chef and can't help you much, but now my wrist tendons have been restored to normal. Taking advantage of this time, I should properly recover my culinary skills. Master will prepare a table of delicious food, waiting for you to return and taste it.\"\n\n\"Master, I...\" Nian Bing didn't know what to say now.\n\nCha Ji released Bing Jie's hand and gently stroked her long hair. \"Remember, I have only one request, and that is for both of you to return alive. I'm waiting for you. If you are no longer here, then even though I have regained my vitality, there will be no reason for me to continue living. I think you both understand what I mean.\"\n\nUnder Cha Ji's reluctant farewell, Nian Bing and Bing Jie stepped through the portal of the spatial teleportation array. A faint light flashed, and their bodies disappeared simultaneously.\n\nLooking at the strange magic before him, Cha Ji's eyes showed a warm aura. \"You must come back alive! I'm waiting for you, forever and ever.\"\n\nWith a flash of light, Nian Bing and Bing Jie appeared at the teleportation point he had set before leaving. As soon as they appeared, he immediately saw over a hundred thousand troops with fluttering banners. These nearly two hundred thousand people were arranged in neat formations, almost everyone busy. Some were building simple fortifications, while others were deployed around the area. Although this was a plain, there were many low hills around, and these hills were where the deployments were made. Although Nian Bing didn't get up immediately, among the crowd, there was a supremely intelligent commander, the Prime Minister of the Orlan Empire, Luo Rou. Even Prince Rong had to admire Luo Rou's command ability in troop deployment and coordination of arms. After a brief discussion, he temporarily handed over the military authority of the four kingdoms to Luo Rou.\n\nThis battle was for the entire Yanggu Continent. It was no longer about the honor of each country, but about the future of all humanity. Whether humanity could continue to exist and develop depended on whether this battle could defeat the army of gods. Therefore, the four great empires were united in a rare display of cooperation. Even a year ago, no one would have believed this was possible, but it was happening. All of this was linked by a single thread. This thread not only connected the four great empires but also their determination to resist the foreign enemy. Nian Bing was that thread.\n\nNian Bing had no objections to Luo Rou's command. He knew very well that Luo Rou, who grew up with formal education, not only possessed intelligence comparable to his own but also had abilities in command and coordination that he couldn't reach. What she could accomplish would definitely be more perfect than what he could do, so why should he add to the chaos?\n\nSoon, Nian Bing met the leadership of the four great empires, while his Stepmother, Bing Jie, went to the Ice God Tower's contingent. Among the military forces of the four great empires, the most elite were clearly the mage corps from the Ice God Tower and the Hua Rong Empire. United, along with the mages from the other two empires, they posed the greatest threat to the gods.\n\nSimple tents appeared on the plain between the two hilly areas. This plain was not very wide, but rather long and narrow. When Nian Bing came last time, he had seen the last oasis on which the survivors depended. Although the area of the lake was not small, its water capacity had been reduced to one-fifth. Moreover, the water quality was extremely poor; the turbid water looked more like it came from a sewage ditch. However, when he returned this time, the lake had changed. Not only had the lake water recovered to about half its original volume, but it was also exceptionally clear.\n\nThe most excited now were the survivors. They had not only received a large amount of food but also a fresh water source. For these survivors who only desired the right to live, nothing could be more perfect than this.\n\nIn the central military tent, when Nian Bing arrived, the leaders of the four great empires were intensely discussing and issuing orders. Clearly, they had not rested much since arriving here last night.\n\n\"Nian Bing, you've come at the right time. We're discussing countermeasures,\" Prince Rong beckoned him forward.\n\nNian Bing stood before Prince Rong, Xue Po, Mu Jing, and Luo Rou, representatives of the four kingdoms. He immediately saw a simple sand table. Although the sand table was simple, the surrounding terrain was clearly displayed. As expected of experienced veterans, although this battle would be very difficult, their combined wisdom demonstrated the strength of humanity's strongest army.\n\nNian Bing glanced at the sand table and said, \"I've already seen it when I arrived. Based on the terrain here, Luo Rou has already made excellent arrangements. The hills on both sides are for surprise attacks, while the center is our strongest defense. The mages are within this defense. When it comes to fighting, you are all much better than me. I have no objections to how you arrange things. I will only be responsible for leading the strongest part of the gods to engage.\"",

    "content": "Prince Rong nodded, glancing at Luo Rou beside him with a strange expression. \"For this operation, I've decided to hand over all military command to Luo Rou, including our Huaron Empire's two most elite legions. No wonder this girl can become a prime minister at such a young age, and that Su Yue recommends her so highly. She hasn't been to the front lines, yet her considerations surpass even my own! It's a shame our Huaron Empire doesn't have such talent.\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled slightly. \"Grandpa Rong, you flatter me. I'm merely a bit clever. How can I compare to you, the continent's number one commander?\"\n\nPrince Rong, for the first time, showed a hint of a smile. \"Alright, stop being humble, you girl. I'm one of the strong fighters on our side. When the real battle begins, I'll join Nian Bing to confront the strongest Divine beings. The command here will be entirely yours. Although you might lack in military experience, with the seasoned Marshal Xue Po's assistance, there should be no problem.\"\n\nXue Po knew Prince Rong was the former leader of the Blood Lion Cult and had no objections to his opinion. Meanwhile, Mu Jing, through continuous contact with Luo Rou, was deeply impressed by her talent. Therefore, Luo Rou had sole authority over the forces of the four empires, and no opposition arose.\n\nLuo Rou smiled faintly. This was not the time for excuses or politeness. \"Since Grandpa Rong and Marshal Xue trust me so much, I will temporarily command the allied armies of the four nations. Now, our troops have already begun to mobilize.\" As she spoke, she pointed to the hilly areas on either side of the sand table.\n\n\"Here, I've deployed heavy crossbowmen and the strongest long-range attack units from our four allied nations. Perhaps they will suffer significant damage at the start of the war, but in this location, if we conceal ourselves properly, we can certainly inflict some damage on the Divine beings. Simultaneously, I've arranged some magicians in these surrounding hills. Their role is to assist the heavy crossbowmen.\" The heavy crossbows she referred to couldn't compare to the God-Slaying Crossbows Nian Bing had developed, but these cumbersome machines, which required two people to pull, could indeed inflict some damage on ordinary Divine beings.\n\nLuo Rou continued, \"To minimize our losses, from the positions of these heavy crossbowmen, I've ordered paths to be cleared behind the hills. We have a large number of warriors, and these paths will be open by tonight at the latest. This way, after the first wave of attacks, these heavy crossbowmen can immediately retreat. With your strong fighters taking care of them, their losses will be minimized. Based on the range of the crossbows, these heavy crossbowmen should have three opportunities to attack. Once their attacks are finished, our strong fighters will need to engage. We absolutely cannot decide the outcome of this battle directly with the Divine beings; instead, we must delay them.\"\n\nNian Bing asked curiously, \"Delay? Why delay?\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled faintly. \"Nian Bing, tell me, what are the weaknesses of these Divine beings?\"\n\nNian Bing answered without hesitation, \"It's their character; they are arrogant but fear death.\"\n\nLuo Rou nodded and then shook her head. \"You're right, and yet not entirely. Although these Divine beings have flaws in their character, I'm certain that their rulers will have a strong deterrent effect on them. With such Divine beings leading, their character flaws will likely only manifest in the final moments of battle. In the initial and most crucial substantive combat, they can be completely disregarded.\"\n\nNian Bing pondered, \"What you say makes sense. For ordinary Divine beings, letting facts speak for themselves would be considered the strongest existence among them. Moreover, it could be said to be their gods. With the deterrence of these main gods, and the Divine beings themselves believing in their strength, they shouldn't show any signs of retreating. Then, what do you say their weakness is?\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled faintly. \"It's very simple: supply.\"\n\n\"Supply?\" Hearing these words, Nian Bing's eyes lit up, and he immediately understood Luo Rou's meaning.\n\nLuo Rou nodded. \"Precisely, supply. Nian Bing, do you remember me deliberately asking you about the situation on the Divine Continent a few days ago? Currently, the Divine Continent lacks support and supplies the most. They have no reinforcements, nor any supplies. Although they are very strong, if they cannot take us down in one go and sustain themselves through battle, their own superior strength will gradually weaken once they lose supplies. The Divine Continent does not produce food; they can only eat those magic beasts. And the Lost Continent is our greatest advantage, which was given to us by the Divine beings during their civilization period on the Lost Continent.\"\n\nNian Bing and Prince Rong simultaneously uttered four words: \"Scorched earth.\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled and nodded. \"Indeed, that's right. Let them taste the consequences of their own actions. This Lost Continent, apart from the areas we've cultivated, has no food. Even drinking water is only available here. Therefore, there's no need for us to do much. By delaying, it will be the best blow to the Divine beings, both physically and psychologically.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned. \"Your plan is indeed very good, but there are two problems before us. Firstly, the number of Divine beings is around ten thousand, and each is a master. What you can think of, they should also know. They will likely carry food like magic beasts with them. Precisely because food is insufficient, the intensity of their first wave of attacks will inevitably be the greatest. Can we withstand it? Another problem is, will the Divine beings bypass us and go to Ice Moon Lake and Yangguang Continent to find food or invade? If so, it will be difficult for us to stop them. After all, the area of this Lost Continent is too vast, and if our people are dispersed, our strength will inevitably be greatly reduced.\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled. \"I've considered these two problems. Let me answer your second question first. While this possibility exists, for us, if they truly choose that path, it would be advantageous to our side. Think about it: the Divine beings, when gathered together, are a very powerful force. However, our side also has no shortage of masters. If they disperse to Yangguang Continent or our Ice Moon Lake, we can organize assassination squads to specifically target isolated Divine beings. Although this would bring some disaster to Yangguang Continent and our newly built Ice Moon Lake, the blow to the Divine beings would undoubtedly be heavier. As I said, they have no reinforcements. Every person killed reduces their strength by one point. We have already discussed this. For the peace of our Yangguang Continent, all four of our nations have sent envoys back to their countries to mobilize more troops to gather at Ice Moon Lake. Except for the main god-level Divine beings, if these Divine beings want to go to Yangguang Continent, they will inevitably have to pass through the Ice Moon Lake region. We will station a large army there. Even if they can break through, they will inevitably be delayed. At that time, we will attack from the rear, and with a pincer attack, it will only be an advantage for us. This time, we are not counting the cost of the war against the Divine beings. As long as we can kill them all, even if a large number of troops die, it will be worth it.\" Although she said it very calmly, everyone could hear the determination in her tone.\n\nNian Bing looked at Luo Rou with some admiration. Her simple explanation had resolved the countermeasures for the Divine beings' potential collective attacks on the rear and scattered infiltration. This was clearly not thought up on the spot. In these past few months, Luo Rou must have made prior plans to be able to speak so comprehensively now. Daughter of Wisdom, truly worthy of being the Daughter of Wisdom from back then! Perhaps I am stronger in small cleverness, but when it comes to wisdom in major matters, I am not as comprehensive as Luo Rou.\n\nLuo Rou smiled. \"Now, let me answer your first question. Whether we can withstand the attack of the Divine beings is indeed very important. Their first wave will naturally be the most ferocious. As long as we withstand this wave of attack, our chances will be much greater. Otherwise, if the elite forces of the four nations are wiped out here by the Divine beings, then our rear will have no force capable of stopping them. Therefore, in the following battle, we must hold on. Hold on at all costs. I already have a simple plan for this. Nian Bing, first, tell me: how many masters on our side can reach the main god level, and how many are at the god level?\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment. \"On our side, there are me, Brother Xi Lu, and my master's wife, Bing Jie, who can truly reach the main god level. There are really only the three of us. We are at a disadvantage in this regard; they have five main gods. Moreover, the main god-level masters I'm referring to are calculated based on the two main gods we've seen before. Thus, among those main gods, there are even stronger main gods. At this level, it's the real gap between us and the Divine beings. The destructive power that two main gods can bring is immense. If Lord Dragon God could stand with us, we would have more chances. However, in terms of god-level masters, that is, around the thirteenth stage, our side has quite a few. The seven Dragon Kings, as well as Cat, my mother, and Grandpa Prince Rong, are all at this level. Coupled with the spirit of my divine weapon and my dragon companion, we might even have more in number than the opponent. After all, we have killed some of their god-level masters before, weakening their strength.\" In the battle in the ice valley last time, at least five or six thirteenth-stage Divine beings were killed, which also laid some foundation for this battle against the Divine Continent.\n\nAfter hearing Nian Bing's words, Luo Rou nodded. \"I understand. According to what you told me before, the weakest Divine beings are probably at the level of a martial artist, but most of them are warriors. Warriors' battle qi has a not-weak resistance to magic, but it's not absolute. Our side has thousands of magicians, and their ordinary strength is not low. In this situation, we need a moment.\"\n\nNian Bing was surprised. \"A moment? What moment? Can you be more specific?\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled confidently. \"This moment doesn't need to be long, but it requires our strong fighters, led by you, to deliver their strongest blow. Remember, it's only a fleeting moment. When the Divine beings attack, our target is not to go head-to-head with those Divine masters. The difference of one or two main gods means we will inevitably be at a disadvantage. Therefore, our initial target will be the weaker ones among the Divine beings. As I said earlier, every Divine being we kill reduces their overall strength by one point. Lower-level Divine beings are obviously easier to kill. Therefore, in the initial battle, we must eliminate as many of the enemy's living forces as possible. This way, even if they want to disperse later, they won't have enough manpower.\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment. \"I understand your general idea, but how can we create this moment? Without truly fighting against a main god, it's impossible to imagine their power.\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled. \"Nian Bing, aren't you surprised why the Seven Dragon Kings aren't here?\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned. \"Did you send them to seek help from the Dragon Clan? The Dragon Clan will surely be involved in this action by the Divine beings against us. Although Lord Dragon God has agreed to help us, it's difficult to predict what will happen when the time comes. Perhaps the Dragon Clan will be a great help to us, but we cannot truly rely on them. The only ones we can truly rely on are ourselves.\"\n\nLuo Rou shook her head. \"You are mistaken. I did not ask the Seven Dragon Kings to request help from the Dragon Clan. Just as you said, the Dragon Clan is a surprise force for us. The Divine beings would not expect the Dragon Clan to be on our side. Therefore, we cannot afford any mishaps with this surprise force. Before the war begins, we naturally cannot let the Seven Dragon Kings contact the Dragon Clan, lest it arouse the vigilance of the Divine beings. Last time in the ice valley, the Seven Dragon Kings did not exert their full strength, perhaps the Divine beings have become suspicious, so we absolutely cannot take risks. When they truly arrive here, we will naturally have opportunities. What I asked the Seven Dragon Kings to do is to scout the enemy using their high-altitude advantage. No one is more suitable for such reconnaissance than them. This way, it will be easier for us to grasp the enemy's movements. Although powerful Divine beings can fly using battle qi, their speed cannot possibly compare to the continent's strongest creatures – dragons. With the Seven Dragon Kings as our scouts, we can maximize our opportunities.\"\n\nPlease vote more, thank you.",

    "content": "\"Do you know what I'm having the soldiers in the center of the battlefield do? They're digging trenches, and all the mages are accumulating magic power, all for that one moment.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes lit up. He finally understood Luo Rou's meaning. \"You mean, the powerful among the divine beings will fly towards me, while the majority of the weaker ones will advance on the ground. This way, we can distinguish their strengths. Coupled with feigning weakness, as soon as they emerge, our experts will slaughter the ordinary divine beings. Is that it?\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled and nodded. \"That's right, exactly. If we were to strike the enemy as a whole at the beginning, then the enemy's experts would likely absorb a large amount of magical attacks, minimizing the damage to their ordinary divine beings. Once the enemy approaches our formation, we will have no way to stop them. Therefore, this separated attack, while seemingly consuming a lot of our mages' magic power, can actually heavily cripple the enemy to the greatest extent. This one attack also lays the foundation for us to withstand the fierce counterattack of the divine beings. After the first wave of attacks, you will lead the strong fighters to meet the crazy counterattack of the high-level divine beings. You only need to hold them off, with the principle of not getting injured yourself. Our long-range attack power will then exchange attacks with you. After these two waves, no matter how powerful the divine beings are, they will inevitably suffer damage. This will be much more favorable to us. The arrangements after that will need to be even more detailed. As long as we cooperate tacitly, repelling the divine beings' first wave of attacks is not very difficult.\"\n\n\"Crossfire, covering fire, Luo Rou, you are so smart.\" Nian Bing looked at the girl in front of him, who seemed delicate but possessed wisdom far more powerful than any magic or martial skill, with admiration.\n\nLuo Rou gave Nian Bing a somewhat aggrieved glance and said, \"This is just theoretical planning. Whether it can actually be done depends on the specific situation at the time. Our biggest disadvantage now is not the gap in overall strength, but how strong the power of the enemy's main gods is. If those five main gods are similar to the two you dealt with last time, then our chances are very high. However, if there is one who no one can stop, then it will be troublesome. Everyone knows what happened back then when the Ice Snow Goddess's priest destroyed a hundred thousand troops with a single divine descent spell. Although we now have a large number of mages, divine descent spells are no longer a threat. However, if the enemy's attack power far exceeds divine descent spells, and we cannot resist it? Actually, I don't have too much hope for the second wave of attacks. Even ordinary divine beings, if they defend, might not be harmed by our long-range attacks. Therefore, during the first wave of attacks, you must do your best to eliminate the ordinary divine beings of the enemy.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"I understand, Rou'er. It seems Grandpa was absolutely right to let you be in charge of everything.\"\n\nPrince Rong beside them said dangerously, \"She only told you the main course of action; many details were left out. I made my decision precisely after hearing her plans. Such an intelligent girl is probably the only one on the Radiant Continent. Even if Su Yue were here, he couldn't do better than her. With such a strategist planning for us, our chances of victory will be much greater. When our strength is inferior to the opponent's, strategy becomes very important.\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled and said, \"Grandpa Rong, you flatter me. How can Rou'er compare to Grandpa Su? This war concerns the survival of our Radiant Continent, so Rou'er must do her best! For this plan, I have been calculating for months until I came here. Based on the terrain, I made the final conclusion. Now, we must prepare as quickly as possible. Nian Bing, you should discuss the methods for slaughtering the enemy with our strong fighters. You must maximize your strength.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"I understand. We will try to avoid losses during the attack. Rou'er, I'll hand over my two thousand elites to you. We'll talk privately later, and I'll tell you about their abilities.\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled slightly. \"I also want to show you some things so you can be mentally prepared.\"\n\nMu Jing said, \"Alright, you two go now.\" There was a hint of sourness in her voice, but towards Luo Rou, she genuinely admired her. This was not something that could be learned through study; Luo Rou's intelligence was a combination of absolute talent and hard work.\n\nNian Bing blushed and looked up at his grandfather. Prince Rong smiled and said, \"You two go ahead. I'll go and brief the Rong family mages. They will be led by your uncle and your father then. Don't worry, with the seven elders overseeing things, your father is fine. He's just worried about you and asked me to tell you to be careful yourself. That's what I want to tell you too.\"\n\nNian Bing looked deeply at Prince Rong, then suddenly smiled and said, \"Grandpa, thank you. We'll be going now.\" After saying that, he left the large tent with Luo Rou.\n\nWatching Nian Bing and Luo Rou's perfectly matched backs, Prince Rong sighed lightly and said, \"Only now does that 'Grandpa' sound truly sincere to me! You boy, you have too much on your mind.\"\n\nXue Po smiled and said, \"Everyone can see Nian Bing's excellence. Although he is not very famous on the Radiant Continent, no one can compare to his status on the Radiant Continent. I believe that even after thousands of years, he will still be the most legendary person on the Radiant Continent. After all, he is only in his early twenties now! When he was my age, I was still cultivating diligently.\"\n\nMu Jing was also watching Nian Bing and Luo Rou leave, her gaze somewhat dazed.\n\nExiting the large tent, Luo Rou smiled and said, \"Nian Bing, follow me. We'll talk as we walk.\" Although she really wanted to spend more time alone with Nian Bing, she also understood the priorities. The current situation could not afford any delay, especially since she had become the chief strategist for the four great empires.\n\nThe two walked side by side, and wherever they passed, they naturally attracted envious glances from those around them. Luo Rou's beauty was a beauty of inner wisdom and ethereal grace. When walking beside Nian Bing, she would always intentionally fall half a step behind to show respect for the man she deeply loved. He was always so rational; even when emotional, she never forgot what she needed to do.\n\n\"Rou'er, thank you. You've been a great help to me this time.\" Nian Bing said with a smile as they walked, looking at Luo Rou beside him. He could naturally feel Luo Rou's feelings, but he already had three beloved women. How could he accept another? If he said he was not moved by Luo Rou, that would be impossible. After all, beauty is human nature, and such a beauty, coupled with such intelligence, made it impossible for him not to be moved. However, he always considered others' feelings and never wanted to see his three wives sad because of his wandering eye. Therefore, he was very careful in his actions and deliberately maintained some distance from Luo Rou and Mu Jing.\n\n\"Thank you for what? You don't need to thank me. I'm just helping myself, or rather, I'm doing it for the Olan Empire.\" Nian Bing's words of thanks made Luo Rou feel a little disappointed. With her sensitivity, she could naturally sense the distance between herself and Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing heard Luo Rou's resentful voice and looked into her deep eyes, his heart trembling slightly. He quickly turned his head to look forward and said, \"The two thousand elites under my command have very strong capabilities. Their abilities are perhaps beyond your imagination. These two thousand people all possess strength above that of a Great Swordsman, with about a third reaching the level of a Martial Artist, and about two percent reaching the level of a Martial Saint.\"\n\nAlthough Luo Rou was blaming Nian Bing for changing the subject abruptly, she was still startled by the numbers he reported. \"So strong? Is this the strength of the Blood Lion Sect you've been hiding?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"I've never hidden the secret of the Blood Lion Sect from you because I trust you and consider you my best friend. To be frank, this time I've gathered the most elite forces of the Blood Lion Sect. Among them are two hundred heavy crossbows, the 'God Slayer Crossbows,' which have long-range attack capabilities. Those two hundred God Slayer Crossbows were the key to my victory in the Ice Valley. Now, I'm handing them over to you to command. I believe that with your coordination ability, you will definitely make them exert their greatest advantage.\"\n\n\"God Slayer Crossbows, God Slayer Crossbows? Nian Bing, how many more surprises do you have in store for me?\" Luo Rou looked at Nian Bing with a half-smile, her eyes filled with admiration. Nian Bing's strength was unfathomable in her eyes, and she naturally understood. The God Slayer Crossbows, which even Nian Bing admired, must have extraordinary strength.\n\nNian Bing said, \"It took me a lot of effort to research these God Slayer Crossbows. However, the God Slayer Crossbows are very restrictive, with very high requirements for the archers. Moreover, the resources consumed by these two hundred God Slayer Crossbows alone are enough to equip a five-thousand-man heavy infantry. Indeed, the best metals of the Ice Moon Empire are used on the God Slayer Crossbows, along with the magic-storing gems on the God Slayer Arrows, which is definitely a considerable expense. If it weren't for my close relationship with Yan Feng, I wouldn't have been able to get support from so many resources.\"\n\nLuo Rou's eyes lit up. \"Then I'll have to see how powerful these God Slayer Crossbows are.\"\n\nNian Bing turned his head and looked at her deeply. \"The arrows shot by the God Slayer Crossbows are almost equivalent to the power of an eleventh-tier forbidden spell. I think, with them, your 'moment' should be able to be extended for a longer time.\"\n\n\"What?\" Although Luo Rou was incredibly intelligent, she could never have imagined that the God Slayer Crossbows would be so powerful. Long-range attack power reaching the level of a forbidden spell was almost unimaginable. With these two hundred God Slayer Crossbows, the Olan Empire would no longer have to fear the powerful cavalry of the Huorong Empire in a head-on battle. Now, any empire with these devastating weapons could probably sweep across the continent with ease.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"I know what you're thinking, but you don't need to worry. The second restriction of the God Slayer Crossbow is the God Slayer Arrows. Although the launching power of the God Slayer Crossbows is extremely astonishing, without special God Slayer Arrows, their power is only greater than ordinary heavy crossbows in range, but their destructive power is much inferior. In internal wars on the continent, if so many experts were to operate the God Slayer Crossbows, it would be better to have them directly participate in the war. After all, operating a God Slayer Crossbow requires at least one expert at the Martial Artist level and two Great Swordsmen to unleash its power.\"\n\nLuo Rou looked at Nian Bing. She knew that only by seeing these God Slayer Crossbows could she truly understand their mystery. She sighed lightly and said, \"It seems our thoughts are in sync. What I wanted to show you today is precisely related to long-range attacks. However, the restrictions on my things are even stronger.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at her in surprise and was about to ask when he heard Luo Rou say, \"Let's hurry. You'll understand when you truly see those things.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, and the two quickened their pace towards the hills in front of the army. As they walked, Nian Bing did indeed see the garrison troops digging trenches on the ground, and each of them was carrying a long wooden board. Wood was a rare commodity on the Lost Continent; it was clearly brought from the Radiant Continent. He wondered what it was used for.\n\nLuo Rou led Nian Bing up the hill, and when Nian Bing saw what Luo Rou had mentioned, he was greatly shocked. His heart was once again shaken by Luo Rou's intelligence.\n\nWhat Nian Bing saw were twenty black objects, each with a diameter of nearly ten feet. Beside them were three mages, all busy adjusting something. These objects looked like they each weighed no less than a thousand kilograms, and they were truly enormous. Although there were wheels underneath, pushing them was extremely difficult. Extending from the front of the black object was a long iron pipe, pointed towards the sky, exuding a killing aura.\n\nNian Bing suddenly remembered something and said to Luo Rou, \"Are these cannons? I've heard of these things before, but aren't they used for defending cities? What are you doing bringing them here?\" He had never seen the power of cannons before, only heard about them. Because of their large size, cannons could only be used for city defense and were always a powerful weapon for defense in warfare. Being able to transport so many cannons here clearly took a lot of effort from Luo Rou.",

    "content": "Luo Rou smiled mysteriously and said, \"These are naturally more than just cannons; otherwise, how could they catch your eye? They were designed by me. It's true that moving them is quite troublesome. In a war within the continent, the enemy could easily destroy them with a cavalry charge. Their biggest drawback is that they can only shoot upwards, not horizontally. Especially after my improvements, they can't even rely on the weight of the shell to fall. I've named these cannons Magic Crystal Cannons, and they are absolutely potent weapons for striking aerial targets.\" As she spoke, she walked behind a cannon and pulled off the cover. What appeared before Nian Bing were three fire-red gems, each the size of a palm.\n\nHe gasped, taking in a sharp breath. The purity of these fire-attribute gems was incredibly high, and they were palm-sized. The cost of these gems alone could rival his God-Slaying Crossbow. Nian Bing vaguely guessed Luo Rou's thoughts and said, \"Your cannons do share many similarities with my God-Slaying Crossbow. The barrel should be adjustable, but I don't understand why they can't attack downwards. It shouldn't be that difficult!\"\n\nLuo Rou said with a wry smile, \"You should have seen it. The shells of the Magic Crystal Cannons are not physical but energy. I poured all my efforts into creating forty of these cannons, and the resources spent could build a city.\n\nBut after the Magic Crystal Cannons were made, I discovered their problem. Although these Magic Crystal Cannons are immensely powerful, it's precisely because of their high energy intensity. Once they unleash their formidable attack power, they generate tremendous recoil. And these Magic Crystal Cannons can only be used by mages.\n\nIt requires three Great Mage-level magic masters to combine their strength to operate them. The immense recoil is something no one can withstand. Mages need to place their hands on these magic crystals, and once an attack is unleashed, the massive recoil will instantly kill the mages, including magical backlash. I carefully studied various methods and finally, after great effort, managed to make them shoot upwards to reduce backlash and recoil. Further research will have to wait for opportunities. The explosive power at the apex of these Magic Crystal Cannons is terrifying. Pure fire-elemental attacks can level a small hill with a single shot.\n\nIt's estimated to have the power of a level ten magic. Through the amplification of the gems, the magical power of three mages is effectively combined to unleash such potent attacks. However, three mages can only fire a maximum of five shots. After the research concluded, I designated them as aerial-defense weapons. Perhaps if I had another ten years to research, or if I had gems of extremely high purity, I could create true Magic Crystal Cannons.\n\nHowever, there's no more time. These are perfect for dealing with those flying divine beings. Magic Crystal Cannons are not cast from steel but from a special synthetic metal that I discovered by accident during my experiments. This metal has no conflict with magical elements; instead, it has a certain amplifying and protective effect. So, in the end, I could say I succeeded halfway.\"\n\n\"Rou'er, you are truly terrifying. Such a thing is probably only something you could research.\" The power of the God-Slaying Crossbow was clearly greater than these Magic Crystal Cannons, and it was much lighter. However, that was entirely based on Nian Bing's own strength; without the God-Slaying Arrows crafted by Nian Bing, the God-Slaying Crossbow could not unleash its true potential. But these Magic Crystal Cannons were different; as long as a mage's level was high enough, they could operate them. The precision of their design was far beyond anything the God-Slaying Crossbow could compare to. Although he hadn't actually witnessed their power, Nian Bing was almost certain that this would become one of the most fearsome killing machines on the continent. Fortunately, their research was not yet fully successful.\n\nLuo Rou glanced at Nian Bing and smiled, \"I know what you want to say, and I know how terrifying this thing is. However, the Oran Empire has been weak for too long. Without ultimate weapons, how can it protect itself? That's why I spared no expense and effort to create these things. But now, it seems I have failed!\n\nDon't worry, if we repel the divine beings this time, I won't continue researching them. After all, with you here, the Huaron Empire will at least be somewhat wary of our Oran Empire. When we become strong ourselves, we won't need such things. This is a secret of our Oran Empire, now revealed to you. If these can play their greatest role in this battle, it will not be in vain for my years of research. Now, the other twenty are on the opposite hills. As long as those divine beings dare to fly over, I will let them know the consequences.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled as he looked at Luo Rou, \"They may not know your power yet, but I do. Rou'er, you are truly much more formidable than I am. It was the greatest mistake for the Ice Moon Empire to force you to leave! Alright, my Miss Rou'er, I've seen these things, and it's time for us to go back. We still have many things to prepare. Oh, right, how are things with the remnants?\" Luo Rou cast a sidelong glance at Nian Bing and said, \"You, you don't have good intentions towards those remnants, do you? Otherwise, you would have let them go to the Ice Moon Lake much earlier.\"\n\nNian Bing sighed, \"You are so smart, you naturally guessed it. Without these remnants, how could we lure the divine beings from the Divine Continent to attack? Although they are bait, I can guarantee that as long as I am here, they will not be harmed. There is no other way.\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled, \"I understand what you mean. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. Oh, right, I can remind you now, your elder brother Xi Lu has become the king of the dwarves among these remnants. He is mingling with the dwarves now. And Miss Youyou has become the recognized queen of these remnants. From now on, you'll need to think about how to handle these tens of thousands of remnants.\"\n\nNian Bing said with a wry smile, \"It would be better for you to help me think about these issues. My mind is entirely focused on the battle now, and I truly don't have the energy to think about these things.\"\n\nLuo Rou rolled her eyes at him, \"I can say that I don't belong to any single empire. And in the future, the Lost Continent will belong to your four empires. What does it have to do with me? Of course, I won't interfere. With elder brother Xi Lu and Youyou there, even if they show some consideration, you will treat these remnants well, so I have even less reason to interfere. I think, with your intelligence, you naturally know what is beneficial to the Oran Empire. Although these remnants do not have their own civilization, they possess their own talents. Elves are said to be the best archers in the legendary Lost Empire, and dwarves are the best master craftsmen. With elder brother Xi Lu there, the advantages of the dwarves will soon become apparent. I don't believe you won't be tempted?\"\n\nLuo Rou shook her head helplessly, \"Sometimes, I feel you are very foolish, because you are willing to give everything for things that are not of great importance to you. But sometimes, you are truly very cunning. Nian Bing, tell me, what kind of person are you?\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Of course, I'm a man. What? Do you want to try?\" The moment he said it, he wanted to slap himself. He knew Luo Rou had feelings for him, yet he spoke like that. Wasn't he asking for trouble? This mouth of his, why was it becoming more and more annoying? In fact, he himself didn't know that with the rescue of his parents, his heart had gradually relaxed, and his mood and personality were inevitably affected. The past repression was gradually being released.\n\nAs expected, although Luo Rou's pretty face blushed, she bravely looked at Nian Bing. Just as she was about to speak, Nian Bing quickly interjected, \"I have something to do, I'm leaving. I'll have my subordinates find you to report later.\" After saying that, he instantly teleported away from the hill.\n\nLooking at the place where Nian Bing disappeared, Luo Rou was stunned for a moment, then stomped her foot in annoyance and chided, \"You coward.\"\n\nHaving \"escaped\" Luo Rou's threat, Nian Bing let out a long sigh, a wry smile appearing on his face. Beautiful women were indeed good, but if there were too many of them, it wasn't necessarily a fortunate thing! However, having Luo Rou around felt great. With her in charge of the overall situation, he could be much more relaxed. From morning until now, he hadn't had a moment to rest, and now he was about to face the attack of the divine army. Nian Bing found a quiet place and began to cultivate by using earth-attribute magic to burrow into the ground, just like when he comprehended innate energy under Fatty's forceful pressure.\n\nNot much time passed. Just two days later, the Seven Dragon Kings had returned. In two days, Luo Rou had made many arrangements. Nian Bing, on the other hand, was quite relaxed. Every day, he simply had brief discussions with the powerhouses about combat tactics and then went to cultivate alone. Now, he could be said to be the sharpest sword in Luo Rou's hand.\n\nThe news brought by the Seven Dragon Kings was naturally from the divine beings. The divine beings had arrived from the Divine Continent to the Radiant Continent and were advancing in a straight line, their target being where they were. Nian Bing had given this war a name: the Radiant-Divine War, the war between the Radiant Continent and the Divine Continent. Compared to the God-Remnant War of the past, this battle was not inferior. In the place that was about to become the battlefield of the Radiant-Divine War, almost all the powerhouses of the Radiant Continent had gathered. For the arrival of this battle, everyone was nervously preparing. Their only goal was to achieve ultimate victory.\n\nThe scouting by the Seven Dragon Kings continued. To prevent being observed by the enemy, they could only observe the movements of the divine army from afar. From the Divine Continent to the place where Nian Bing and the others were located, it would take at least four to five days. After all, the divine beings were not all capable of flight. The strength of most divine servants was only considered mid-to-upper tier on the Radiant Continent. Therefore, there were still four to five days left for final preparations before the war.\n\n\"Mao Mao, you don't need to participate in the first wave of combat. I'm afraid your pets won't have time to retreat.\" Nian Bing looked at Mao Mao, whom he had always treated as a little sister, with concern.\n\nMao Mao stubbornly shook her head and said, \"No, I must participate. These divine beings are the murderers of my parents; I want to avenge my father and mother. Brother Nian Bing, our White Race was annihilated because of them!\" As she spoke, her eyes couldn't help but turn red.\n\nNian Bing was surprised to find that Mao Mao was no longer the little girl she used to be. Compared to before, she had matured. Besides her tone, her appearance and figure had grown into a stunning beauty, no less than Feng Nü or the others. Coupled with her delicate voice, it was easy to evoke a sense of closeness.\n\nSeeing Nian Bing remain silent, Mao Mao quickly continued, \"Brother Nian Bing, please let me participate. I promise I will be careful. My little pets are very good at protecting themselves. I promise you, as soon as you retreat, I will immediately recall them. You know, I can recall them into space!\"\n\nNian Bing frowned, \"But your own body cannot withstand the attacks of those divine beings! You control these pets from a distance; otherwise, they won't feel your thoughts, their strength will greatly decrease, and they might even cause chaos. Therefore, I think it's better for you to take action in the later battles.\"\n\nMao Mao said somewhat aggrievedly, \"No, I want to participate in the first wave of attack. At most, you can protect me.\"\n\n\"Nian Bing, let Mao Mao go too. You have to believe in her strength; her mental magic is very powerful now. Besides, we will protect her. As long as we retreat in time, there won't be any problems.\" Two figures, blue and red, appeared. Feng Nü and Lan Chen had arrived. These days, they were still researching the Heart of the Phoenix, but the results were quite ordinary, and they hadn't made any further breakthroughs.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly, a trace of essence showing in his eyes, and looked deeply at Mao Mao. \"Alright then, you all watch over her more then. I will be the main attacker, and under the counterattack of the Arch-Gods, I will also have to resist their attacks. Entrusting Mao Mao to you will make me feel more at ease.\"\n\nThe Dragon Kings returned for the last time in their role as scouts. The news they brought was simple: in another day, the divine beings would set foot on this land. On Nian Bing's side, all preparations had been completed under Luo Rou's command, and the experts of the Radiant Continent also had to start preparing.",

    "content": "A day can sometimes feel very long, and other times it can pass by incredibly quickly. As the sun reached its zenith in the sky, an immense, invisible pressure descended like a vast net from the front, enveloping the elite allied forces on the continent of Yangguang.\n\nLuo Rou stood at the forefront of the formation, with the seven elders of the Blood Lion Cult guarding her. They were all waiting. Luo Rou was still dressed in a white gown, a stark contrast amidst the surrounding steel-clad guards, yet her presence at the head of the army instilled confidence in all the soldiers.\n\nLuo Rou raised her right hand. Though she had not yet seen the gods, the aura alone told her everything.\n\nThe elite forces of the four-nation allied army had quietly infiltrated the trenches they had long since dug. From the surface, everything appeared calm. Led by Wulu and Youyou, the remnants were scattered at the rear of the formation. Gazing towards the direction of the approaching pressure, they showed no panic. Although they didn't know the full might of the force to come, they believed in the abilities of the Dwarf King and the Goddess before them to save them. Sometimes, faith plays an enormous role.\n\nLuo Rou remained standing there, the surrounding emptiness accentuating her exquisite beauty. She showed no hint of panic, still gazing into the distance. In her hand, however, there were now a few items.\n\nWhat must come, will come. Luo Rou’s analysis was accurate. As the King of Gods, Xi Jie had considered many possibilities. However, upon receiving news of the Lost Continent, he believed it would not require much effort to eliminate these remnants. The reason he led all the gods out in full force this time was that his true target was the continent of Yangguang; the Lost Continent was merely a simple stepping stone. Only the prosperity of Yangguang was what he desired.\n\nAs he journeyed, observing the barren and desolate Lost Continent, Xi Jie couldn't help but be astonished. While other gods might not know, as the King of Primary Gods, how could he not be aware of the reasons behind all this? He once again gained a profound understanding of the power of the three Great True Gods.\n\nFrom the moment he set foot on the continent of Yifu, he had led the god army at the fastest possible pace. It wasn't out of fear that the remnants would escape, but rather because the food and water that the gods could obtain from the Lost Continent were exceedingly scarce. While the powerful gods could endure for a period without sustenance, without water, ordinary gods, aside from those above god-level, would find it very difficult to persevere. Therefore, he intended to eliminate the last remnants of the continent of Yifu before proceeding to Yangguang. Once there, all supply issues would be effortlessly resolved.\n\nXi Jie was equally proud. Although the fact that Nian Bing had killed one Primary God and severely injured another had made him cautious, he didn't believe that Yangguang would react quickly. Even if they knew his god army was coming to attack, they likely wouldn't be able to resist. Therefore, he came full of confidence, unaware that an invisible net was quietly waiting for them. Xi Jie's greatest mistake was failing to calculate Nian Bing's influence over the four great empires of Yangguang. Of course, he couldn't be entirely blamed; anyone else would also find it impossible to imagine that someone not widely renowned on Yangguang would have such close ties with all four great empires.\n\nThe number of gods flying in the sky was slightly less than Nian Bing and Luo Rou had estimated, only a little over twenty. However, these twenty-odd individuals included five Primary Gods and eighteen God-level experts; they were the true powerhouses among the gods. As powerhouses among the gods, they were all very proud, which was why they chose to fly. This not only allowed them to see farther but also reflected their status. While the Demigod-level experts could barely fly, ordinary gods required them to be led. Therefore, they walked below.\n\nThe formation of the gods was not neat; they were not an army but over ten thousand experts. Thus, this disorganized group moved with astonishing speed. In just a few breaths after Luo Rou sensed the immense pressure, the god army was visible in the distance.\n\nXi Jie flew in the center of the gods in the air, with the surrounding Primary Gods and gods surrounding him. Although proud, he was a cautious person, and he had made some preparations for this operation. For example, the Dragon God and over a hundred dragons of the Dragon Clan were flying at the rear of the formation. He had deliberately separated the Dragon Clan from his god army. Originally, he wanted the Dragon God to be with him, but the Dragon God said he could not leave his people, so he stayed at the rear with all the dragons. What made Xi Jie particularly satisfied was that this operation saw the Dragon Clan deploy all its adult dragons, including the Dragon God, which was an exceptionally formidable force. After all, even the weakest adult dragon possessed a power level of ten to eleven, and all the experts in the Dragon Clan were around level twelve, second only to the seven Dragon Kings and the Dragon God who remained on Yangguang. These dragons, relying on their physical bodies, could become a terrifying force. Moreover, Xi Jie was well aware of the psychological pressure that dragons exerted on Yangguang.\n\n\"Lord Xi Jie, we are almost there,\" a God-level expert whispered behind Xi Jie.\n\nXi Jie's eyes flashed with divine light. In the distance, he could already see the remnants below, and a cold, stern expression appeared on his face. He waved his hand forward. Killing these remnants was as easy as crushing ants; there was no need for the gods flying in the sky to act. The divine servants and demigods below could easily handle it.\n\nAt Xi Jie's signal, the gods below accelerated their charge, and Xi Jie and the others also increased their flying speed. He wanted to witness this bloody slaughter with his own eyes. The flying speed and the speed of the gods advancing below were very fast. Luo Rou watched the approaching enemy calmly, her expression unchanged. A small scroll appeared in her hand. This scroll was specifically designed for her by Nian Bing and could be easily used without magic power. It was not for attacking.\n\nAs Xi Jie flew forward, suddenly, his Yunxue, which had reached the ultimate realm, trembled slightly. He faintly heard some strange sounds, like something being stretched taut under immense force. His usually relaxed heart suddenly leaped twice violently. His divine light flashed, and the ability of his Yunxue immediately covered the area below. Although he was flying at an altitude of three hundred zhang above the ground, with his power, his Yunxue could clearly hear even the slightest movement below. As the feedback from Yunxue entered his brain, Xi Jie's expression changed, because he vaguely heard the heartbeats of nearly two hundred thousand individuals. A huge sound wave emanated from his mouth, \"Halt.\n\nThere's an ambush, all retreat.\" Xi Jie's voice was immense. With his power, once his voice was uttered, it was clearly heard by every god. However, it was still too late. Directly opposite him, he saw a peerlessly beautiful woman dressed in white. With a mere flick of her wrist, a ball of red light shot into the sky. Upon reaching a hundred zhang, it suddenly exploded. It was a ball of fire, and at the same time, it resembled a giant blood flower.\n\nCountless light projections shot out from the surrounding hills and mounds, some very clear, others very blurry. Xi Jie and the others in the air were like perfect targets, as waves of attacks resembling flying locusts descended upon them.\n\nThe suddenness of the attack made Xi Jie frown. Although he didn't understand why so many people had appeared here all of a sudden, he still felt no panic. This was because he didn't believe that, apart from those few True Gods, anything else in this world could threaten his existence.\n\nThere was no need for Xi Jie to act, nor for the other four Primary Gods to act. The eighteen God-level experts simultaneously activated their battle qi, and a rainbow-like radiance exploded around their bodies, deflecting the incoming heavy crossbow bolts one by one. Compared to their battle qi, these powerful armor-piercing arrows were not even considered a tickle.\n\nWatching the battle qi light emanating from the gods in the air, Luo Rou revealed a faint smile. This was not the true first wave of attack; it was one of her steps to feign weakness. What she needed was to prevent the gods above from acting, and this first wave of attack clearly failed to achieve that.\n\nAnd just as the eighteen God-level experts in the air were using their battle qi for defense, the gods below, who had not yet recovered from their shock, suddenly felt the ground vibrate.\n\nWith a series of thunderous roars, the earth actually collapsed. Including the Demigod-level experts, the over ten thousand gods below were instantly thrown into chaos. Over a dozen massive magical beasts appeared out of thin air. Several low-level divine servants, who failed to dodge in time, were instantly torn to shreds. Nearly twenty figures lit up with dazzling brilliance, and the massacre began in an instant.\n\nNian Bing and the others were hidden underground. In the area where the gods had set foot, the ground below had long been hollowed out. With the existence of two Dark Rats, this was not a difficult task. Emerging from underground was Nian Bing, leading the charge. In this operation, Prince Rong, Nian Bing's mother Bing Ling, and Bing Jie did not participate because such close-range combat was not suitable for them as mages. Of course, Nian Bing was an exception; he was the leader of these attackers.\n\nSeven-colored light shot out like lightning from Nian Bing's body. The moment he appeared, each of the seven Blade Souls had taken the lives of four or five divine servants. After Nian Bing's three-day reinforcement, the strength of each Blade Soul had improved. The sudden sneak attack achieved the desired effect. Nian Bing, of course, did not stand idle. As the seven Blade Souls unleashed their attacks, he simultaneously conjured four forbidden spells around his body. He chose his location very well, precisely in the center of the gods. Here, there were only the lowest-level divine servants. These divine servants, mostly with power levels of only eight or nine, had a vast gap in strength compared to Nian Bing. The instantaneous effect of four level-eleven forbidden spells was that, with Nian Bing at the center, there were no living creatures within a twenty-zhang radius. At least hundreds of gods died under his sudden attack. These gods possessed battle qi. If they could have united, even with Nian Bing's potent magic attacks, such heavy casualties would not have occurred. The root of everything was the suddenness of the attack. The gods had never imagined that their own side would be ambushed.\n\nThe powerhouses of this ambush were led by Nian Bing, and also included Wu Lu, Feng Nu, and Lan Chen. The four of them formed the most elite force. Originally, Nian Bing wanted the Holy Master to participate in this ambush, but the Holy Master insisted on not doing so. Although he was willing to oppose the God Continent for the survival of Yangguang, he absolutely refused to participate in a sneak attack. Of course, seven others were also involved in this ambush; no, it should be said, seven dragons. The seven Dragon Kings had all transformed into human form. Their appearance alongside Nian Bing and the other four instantly became a disaster for the ordinary divine servants.\n\nIn almost an instant, nearly a thousand divine servants had perished at the hands of these eleven. This seemingly simple feat was the result of meticulous calculation. Nian Bing and the other eleven were completely dispersed, allowing them to fully unleash their individual strengths in the attack. If it weren't for Nian Bing wanting to conserve his spiritual power to deal with the Primary Gods above, the casualty count would have been much higher. However, even so, the loss of nearly a thousand people in an instant nearly caused Xi Jie in the sky to explode with rage. He could never have imagined that the first war after leaving the God Continent would begin in such a manner.\n\nAfter the brief sneak attack, the gods began to display their due strength. All the divine servants retreated to the surroundings, while the demigods moved forward to engage. There were also variations in the strength of the demigods. Those with stronger battle qi could approach level thirteen, while those with weaker strength were around level twelve. With the encirclement of over a hundred demigods, the casualty rate of Nian Bing and the other eleven significantly decreased. They could now only calculate casualties in single digits per second. Gods above level twelve were exceptionally powerful, and killing them was not easy.\n\nNaturally, Xi Jie could not allow such a situation to continue. He recognized the seven Dragon Kings below at a glance. However, by this time, it was too late for him to issue orders. With a wave of his hand, he, along with the other four Primary Gods, descended simultaneously. They had almost all activated their Earth Spirit Apertures, and within a few blinks, they would enter the battlefield below. Xi Jie had made up his mind; no matter who these people below were, he would utterly destroy these scoundrels who dared to kill gods.\n\nBut just then, the battlefield suddenly changed. Another volley of projectiles shot into the sky. The red and blue radiating light was significantly sparser than the previous heavy crossbows. Facing them were the Primary Gods and God-level experts who were preparing to charge down.",

    "content": "Naturally, Xi Jie did not take these things seriously. In his eyes, even without using fighting energy for defense, his body, which was more powerful than that of dragons, could easily withstand the attack of these crossbow bolts. However, soon these red and blue lights informed him of a fact: these were not ordinary crossbow bolts, but were specifically designed to slay gods.\n\nThe violent explosions caused a complete change in the magical elements in the sky. The destructive energy instantly halted the Arch-Gods' descent. Perhaps eleventh-tier forbidden spells were just a joke to the Arch-Gods, but what if there were a hundred forbidden spells appearing simultaneously? Even Xi Jie could not afford to not take it seriously. Moreover, they had been deceived by the display of weakness, and the sudden attack generated even greater power. What made Xi Jie vigilant was a cry of alarm from Xia Yu, who had already been expelled from the ranks of the Arch-Gods. Others had not seen it, but Xia Yu had seen the power of these god-slaying arrows.\n\nThe true strength of the Arch-Gods could only be truly appreciated in battle. As the explosions occurred, five masses of milky-white light dispersed, not only protecting the bodies of the five Arch-Gods but also fully shielding the eighteen god-level experts surrounding them.\n\nHow powerful were two hundred god-slaying arrows converging into a hundred forbidden spells? No one could answer, and no one could calculate. However, what made Luo Rou's heart pound even faster was that the strongest among these divine beings were not killed by the hundred forbidden spells. Just this fact alone astonished her, and she finally understood why Nian Bing was so wary of these Arch-Gods.\n\nBelow, Mao Mao's magical beasts were still raging wildly, and Nian Bing was also relentlessly killing. While the powerful divine beings in the sky had withstood the attack of the god-slaying arrows, their downward charge had turned into an upward rush. After all, the god-slaying arrows were created by Nian Bing and the others in that brief moment, and it was not a short moment.\n\nWhen Xi Jie forcefully pushed away the surrounding frantic magical elements with his fighting energy, his heart finally became enraged. At the same time, he knew that he had ultimately underestimated humans.\n\n\"They are from the Yangguang Continent. The fellow below who is constantly casting magic, that's him. He killed Gu Long.\" Xia Yu looked at Nian Bing below with hatred. If it weren't for him, how could she have lost her status as an Arch-God?\n\nXi Jie remained silent. He swung his hands forward simultaneously, and two enormous beams of golden light shot down, piercing through the second wave of flying god-slaying arrows and heading straight for Nian Bing below. The other four Arch-Gods also attacked simultaneously. Distance was not absolute for them. At this moment, the Arch-Gods displayed their Arch-God level strength in front of the surrounding god-level experts.\n\nThe moment Xi Jie attacked, Nian Bing clearly felt the pressure from above. However, he showed no panic at all. He knew very well that once locked onto by an attack of that magnitude, there would be no chance to escape, and he could only choose to fight head-on. But he was well prepared for this.\n\nAlmost instantaneously, eleven clusters of silver light illuminated, and the ten-odd magical beasts disappeared simultaneously. The Arch-Gods' attack was abruptly halted in mid-air. Immediately after, Xi Jie saw a splash of blood emitting radiant light in the air.\n\nWhat is the strength of an Arch-God? To be able to forcibly change the direction of raging energy after initiating an attack, that is the strength of an Arch-God. Led by Xi Jie, although the five Arch-Gods had lost track of Nian Bing and the others, their attacks did not cease. All ten beams of light swept towards the hills on both sides. They wanted to eliminate the hidden threats that had nearly harmed them.\n\nHowever, at this moment, forty booms resounded. Forty massive spheres of red light shot up into the sky, directly meeting their attacks. These were forty fireballs, each incredibly condensed. Unfortunately, in just an instant, the fireballs were swallowed by the dazzling divine light. Following the direction of the fireball attacks, without even a scream, a total of one hundred and twenty mages from the Olan Empire, along with Luo Rou's magic crystal cannons, disappeared. However, they did slow down the time of destruction and reduce its destructive power. Although thousands of heavy crossbowmen lost their lives in the intense explosion, the Blood Guards and the elites of the Ice Moon Hall who had fired two volleys had just managed to withdraw from the explosion range and were unharmed. Their god-slaying crossbows were ultimately preserved.\n\nAlthough Luo Rou had fired the second signal from her hand, her heart was bleeding at this moment. How much effort had those magic crystal cannons cost her? When she developed these magic crystal cannons, she never imagined that anyone could contend with them. Yet, just moments ago, she watched helplessly as her life's work, along with those one hundred and twenty precious mages, turned to ashes. Those mages represented almost one-third of the entire advanced mages of the Olan Empire.\n\nWar is cruel. As a commander, one must not be influenced by emotions. Luo Rou understood this, of course, so her command did not stop. The first wave of attacks had ended, and the second wave was just beginning. The low chanting had started as soon as the first splash of blood erupted, and now was the time for them to unleash their full power. Thousands of red lights condensed in the sky, making the entire world seem to turn red. The air clearly became hot, and a purple light was injected into this dazzling red from nowhere. The red light seemed to have found its source and rapidly converged. The violent fire dragon transformed into an incredibly massive flame dragon in the sky. The dragon was hundreds of feet long; even if the Dragon Kings and Dragon Gods of the dragon race came together, they could not compare to its size.\n\nXi Jie's hand, which was about to attack again, stopped. Looking at the enormous flame, his gaze became somewhat fixed. This was energy that could threaten him! The power of this magic had even surpassed the fourteenth tier, reaching close to the fifteenth tier. He saw this magic, and all the divine beings saw it too. As Nian Bing and the others, along with the magical beasts, disappeared, all the divine beings quickly consolidated, combining their fighting energy. For a moment, the area below was filled with light of various colors. True power finally appeared at this moment.\n\nBack then, led by Bing Ling, the hundred magic experts of the Ice God Tower had condensed an ice lotus of up to the fourteenth tier. It was that ice lotus that temporarily stopped Gu Long and Xia Yu's attacks. Although the experts of the Rong family could not match the mages of the Ice God Tower one-on-one, they had the advantage of numbers. One thousand magic experts above Great Mage level, led by Prince Rong and his two brothers, after years of hard training, finally unleashed their secret weapon: Fire Elemental Fusion Magic. The research for this magic had only one goal: the Ice God Tower. It was precisely because of the existence of this magic that Prince Rong dared to invade the Qilu Empire without regard for the Ice Goddess, and prepare to conquer the entire Yangguang Continent. This was the strongest attack method of the Hua Rong Empire!\n\nXi Jie let out a cold snort. A faint golden light emanated from him. This light did not seem to originate from acupuncture points, but from every part of his body. This unusual phenomenon was something only he among all the divine beings could achieve. This was not similar to the abilities of light magic, but pure fighting energy. The intensity of this fighting energy was extremely terrifying.\n\nThe ten-odd figures who had vanished in the previous instant, except for Mao Mao, all reappeared in mid-air. Led by Nian Bing, he, along with the Seven Dragon Kings, the Phoenix sisters, and the dwarf Xi Lu, a total of eleven people, appeared before the Arch-Gods and god-level experts in the sky. Looking at the faint golden light emanating from Xi Jie, Nian Bing was also inwardly astonished, but he showed no fear, saying coldly, \"Your opponents are us.\" Seven sword souls floated out, and the colorful light of the Heavenly Eye Domain instantly enveloped all the experts on their side. At this moment, two blue figures flashed behind them at lightning speed; they were Nian Bing's mother, Bing Ling, and his martial aunt, Bing Jie. The appearance of the two women further strengthened Nian Bing's side. On Nian Bing's side, at least four people could reach the fourteenth tier: himself, Xi Lu, Hei Wu Huang, and Bing Jie. Coupled with the other thirteenth-tier experts, even if their overall strength was inferior to the divine beings before them, it was absolutely not much inferior. It was precisely for this reason that Luo Rou dared to let them block the enemy's attack.\n\nXi Jie looked at Nian Bing coldly. His gaze was almost palpable. Besides anger, there was a hint of mockery in his eyes. He seemed unfazed by the massive magic power condensed by the thousand fire mages in the distance, and said faintly, \"Is this the strength of you humans? I never expected that the countries of the Yangguang Continent would have such foresight to dare to block our advance here. However, do you think this can stop us? You underestimate the strength of my Divine Continent too much.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes flashed with cold light, \"Whether we can stop you is not something you can decide with just words. Let's settle this with action. It seems you should be the leader of these divine beings, so I will be your opponent.\" Although he clearly felt that the energy intensity of Xi Jie was strange, he bravely stepped forward. As the strongest among the experts of the Yangguang Continent, he naturally had to face the strongest of the opposing side, who was the leader of all the divine beings.\n\nXi Jie snorted disdainfully, \"Just you? You are not worthy. Attack.\"\n\nFour beams of golden light lit up simultaneously. The attack method of the four Arch-Gods, excluding Xi Jie, was very simple. They all simultaneously extended their right hands, and four beams of golden light shot straight towards the seven sword souls at the forefront of the group. The eighteen god-level experts behind them also moved, and massive energy surged, with fighting energies of various colors charging towards everyone in the most condensed form.\n\nNian Bing did not become angry because of Xi Jie's words. At their level, calmness was simple and very important. As everyone began to move, Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye Domain suddenly changed. The original colorful light instantly turned into a faint golden hue, and this faint gold for the mages instantly boosted the abilities of all their allies. The seven sword souls in front merged into a single vertical line, with Hei Wu Huang at the center, and simultaneously unleashed a sword strike. The seven-colored light forcefully met the golden light emitted by the four Arch-Gods. Their battle became the true beginning of the conflict. However, the explosive force generated by their mutual attacks rendered all subsequent attacks by others aimless.\n\nThe golden light and the seven-colored light collided in the sky in an instant. In that brief moment, it was as if the sky had gained a sun. The intense light did not create a roaring sound, but whether it was the divine beings' side or Nian Bing's side, both were thrown backward by the intense explosion. With flickering light and shadow, dozens of top experts on both sides, after a brief contact, broke away from their attack trajectories and were pushed hundreds of feet away by the recoil force.\n\nIt was at this moment that the long-prepared fire magic exploded. Simultaneously, Nian Bing's keen Heavenly Eye orifice was shocked to discover that Xi Jie, who had not yet attacked, suddenly disappeared before his eyes.\n\nThe ability to instantly teleport short distances using fighting energy was something every warrior expert could achieve. However, to be able to teleport without being affected by such intense collisions and the massive energy generated was something Nian Bing, who possessed seven elemental magics, admitted he could not do. But Xi Jie had accomplished it.\n\nNian Bing and the others' objective was simple. Given their overall inferior strength compared to the opponents, following Luo Rou's plan, their target was to have the mages tie down the strong individuals among the divine beings, allowing the fire magic experts led by Prince Rong to launch their strongest attack and consume the divine beings' active forces as much as possible. Just a few moments would be enough to weaken the enemy's overall strength. Every additional divine being killed was very important to them. However, Xi Jie's sudden disappearance made Nian Bing feel that something was amiss.\n\nThe flame dragon, hundreds of feet long, had turned a deep purple. The power of a thousand mages jointly casting the same elemental magic was terrifying, especially since they had practiced together for an unknown period. These elites of the Rong family possessed extraordinary magical talent and had achieved their current accomplishments through lifelong cultivation. This hundred-foot-long flame dragon was actually the result of fully compressed fire magic. To use this magic, almost all the Rong family mages had poured out all their magical power, making this single blow push the magic's power to its peak instantly.\n\nWhen the divine beings below saw this terrifying magic appear, they seemed somewhat panicked, but they quickly calmed down. The demigod-level experts quickly moved to the front of the ranks. Nearly nine thousand divine beings simultaneously activated their fighting energy. The abilities of fighting energy were difficult to combine into a full attack like magic.",

    "content": "Because Dou Qi, unlike magic, has a limited attack range. Of course, at extremely high levels, this restriction no longer exists. However, these gods and men, who have always lived on the God Continent under extremely harsh conditions, have their own methods. They almost always group together by the dozens, fusing their Dou Qi into powerful streams of energy. Their Dou Qi appears in the air as energy projectiles, awaiting the descent of the massive magic.\n\nThe hundred-zhang long flame dragon looks so terrifying. As it fully extends its body and lunges forward, the surrounding air does not distort due to heat. In this instant, all the air around the flame dragon has been incinerated, turning the area within a thousand zhang into a terrifying vacuum. This situation was not even anticipated by Prince Rong. The energy possessed by this magic was truly immense. Once it launched, no one could control the power of its attack; everything would be completed by this terrifying magic itself.\n\nWhen the flame dragon was still a thousand zhang away from all the gods and men, they could already feel the suffocating heat. At this moment, in order to preserve their lives, some gods and men did not hold back at all, unleashing their Dou Qi to its limits. They all knew that only by joining forces could they block this magic.\n\nPrince Rong naturally understood that while the attack power of a thousand mages was terrifying, there were still nine thousand gods and men on the opposing side. If they attacked uniformly from above, the damage produced would be minimal under the influence of the opponent's numerous Dou Qi. Therefore, when the flame dragon received his final command, the giant dragon god swooped down. As it got within a hundred zhang of the gods and men, the colossal dragon god was level with the ground, charging directly at the gods and men from the front. Doing so could maximize the casualties among the gods and men. Although they would certainly be able to block it, the gods and men at the forefront would undoubtedly suffer extremely severe blows. Faced with this magic approaching level fifteen, their chances of survival would be absolutely, absolutely zero.\n\nExcept for Nian Bing, everyone on the side of the Guang Continent present believed the plan had succeeded and was ready to watch the flame dragon slaughter the gods and men. Even Luo Rou was pleased with her plan, and her previously low spirits due to the losses had recovered somewhat. If someone had told Luo Rou a few years ago that the power of one person could change the entire battlefield, she would not have believed it. However, after witnessing Nian Bing's strength, she had gained some understanding of this statement. But today, the enemy they faced taught her a very vivid lesson.\n\nThe flame dragon, a hundred zhang long flame dragon! Its colossal body was so terrifying. As it flew close to the ground, the soil beneath it naturally vanished, forming a deep沟壑 (gōuhè - ditch/ravine). However, just as it was charging forward with all its might, a golden figure suddenly appeared at the very front of all the gods and men amidst their cheers. He did not wait but charged towards the flame dragon.\n\nPrince Rong's eyes widened. He could not believe that with the power of one person, someone would dare to face the attack of a thousand fire mages from his side alone. However, the fact was before his eyes; the opponent had done just that. In the next moment, under the pull of the magic's aura, Prince Rong felt a violent tremor throughout his body, a sharp pain in his brain, and a sharp drop in his mental energy, causing him to involuntarily spit out a mouthful of dry, fresh blood.\n\nThe golden light was so minuscule before the hundred-zhang flame dragon, yet it was so steadfast. Xi Jie faced the attack of such a colossal magic alone, his expression unchanged, as if he had never worried about his own safety. He raised his hands, and dense golden light transformed into a massive golden shield three zhang in diameter before him. Holding it with his left hand, he blocked the charging flame dragon directly.\n\nThe immense impact force caused Xi Jie to retreat continuously. As his body slid backward, the golden shield in his hand erupted with an extraordinarily intense golden light. It was an unparalleled brilliance; another sun appeared on the ground.\n\nThe flame dragon charged madly with roars. Its incredibly condensed true fire power had reached its limit. All nine thousand gods and men were rapidly retreating, and Xi Jie was also retreating under the flame dragon's impact. At this moment, everyone could almost see that Xi Jie's retreat speed, which was initially irresistible, gradually slowed down, and the golden light on his left hand grew stronger and stronger. A flush rose on Xi Jie's calm face; his eyes had completely turned golden.\n\nNian Bing, in the air, desperately wanted to attack below, but the four Archgods and eighteen God-level experts in front of him prevented him from freeing his hands. Although the four Archgods were wary of Nian Bing's materialized mental attacks, their coordination was extremely tacit. The powerful fluctuations of Dou Qi they exuded gave Nian Bing no chance to unleash his own abilities. He could only rely on his own Sky Eye Domain to fully amplify the strength of his allies. He could not leave now; otherwise, his strong allies would inevitably be crushed by the opponent's attack.\n\nThe Sky Eye Domain Nian Bing was currently displaying was an evolved ability. After he completely understood the mystery of the fusion of the two acupoints, his Sky Eye Domain underwent a transformation. It not only possessed attack power but also the ability to convert. What would be the effect of integrating the abilities of the Imperial Acupoint into the Sky Eye Domain? The effect was simple: it would merge the Sky Eye Domain's original three abilities into one and greatly enhance them.\n\nThe Sky Eye Domain's original abilities were defense, weakening, and amplification. Its weakening ability was of little use against these experts above the God level. After all, it was almost impossible to weaken Dou Qi of their caliber, let alone the fact that these gods and men had different Dou Qi attributes. If each attribute were to be weakened, then the impact would not be limited to the opponent. Therefore, Nian Bing chose amplification. With the help of the Imperial Acupoint, the Sky Eye Domain, under full amplification, displayed supreme-level capabilities. Under his amplification, in the face of the four Archgods' first attack, the seven Blade Souls, led by Hei Wu Huang, managed to block it, thereby giving others time to counterattack and creating an opportunity for the flame dragon's destruction. If not for Xi Jie's sudden appearance below, their plan would have succeeded. Under the supreme amplification of the Sky Eye Domain, although the seven Blade Souls needed some time to recover their energy, the four Archgods' energy also suffered some disturbance. The Blade Souls were immortal, and with Nian Bing's full effort, the Western Meridian Acupoint could quickly help them recover their strength. At least, without Xi Jie's involvement, Nian Bing's side's overall strength was not weaker than these gods and men before them.\n\nOf course, some gods and men wanted to sneak attack Nian Bing and destroy this human who caused them the most trouble, but could Nian Bing's allies give them this opportunity? The answer was no. Under the full assault of Nian Bing's allies, led by Xi Lu and Bing Jie, and under the large-scale protection of the Seven Dragon Kings, killing Nian Bing would require stepping over the corpses of these individuals. The advantage of the four Archgods was not evident, while Nian Bing's seven Blade Souls were constantly recovering. The situation was such that Nian Bing's side even had a slight advantage. However, at this moment, Nian Bing did not feel any ease; instead, his heart became extraordinarily heavy. Why was this? Because Xi Jie's performance below was too powerful, so powerful that no one could imagine.\n\nMagic approaching level fifteen had an essential difference from magic of level fourteen. Nian Bing would not dare to face the combined attack of a thousand mages head-on, even if he were to join forces with the seven Blade Souls. However, Xi Jie had done it.\n\nAt this time, from the moment he began blocking the flame dragon's attack with the golden shield until now, Xi Jie had retreated about five hundred zhang. The gods and men had also retreated five hundred zhang, but Xi Jie's retreat speed had become very slow. The flame dragon's impact force had clearly weakened, but the golden shield issued by Xi Jie was still as dazzling as ever. Anyone could see that this supreme magic approaching level fifteen could no longer achieve its intended purpose, and all of this was because of one person! No, it should be said, a god. At this moment, the Guang Continent's side truly felt how terrifying the strength of gods and men was.\n\nXi Jie's defense ended quickly because, in addition to using his left hand to hold up the shield to block the flame dragon, he also had a right hand. What could his right hand do? Xi Jie clearly informed the humans of the Guang Continent. A golden battle saber about five feet long appeared in his right hand. It was not condensed from Dou Qi but was a genuine battle saber. If Xi Lu were able to see it now, he would be astonished to find that the energy intensity of this battle saber was absolutely that of a divine artifact.\n\nWhat is a divine artifact? The greatest characteristic of a divine artifact is that the stronger the master, the greater its power. Xi Jie perfectly exemplified this concept. He raised the five-foot-long golden battle saber, shield in his left hand, battle saber in his right. Like a celestial god, he suddenly retreated lightning-fast, moving over a hundred zhang in an instant. He once again allowed Nian Bing to witness instantaneous movement amidst the violent fluctuations of magic elements and energy. As Xi Jie retreated, the shield in his left hand disappeared. The flame dragon took this opportunity to lunge forward. Just as all the humans thought Xi Jie could not withstand this ferocious attack, the disappeared shield had transformed into an exceptionally surging golden light and merged into his battle saber.\n\nWhat did the humans see? They saw golden lightning. Yes, although the golden lightning was brilliant for only an instant, it was enough. The golden lightning was a linear attack, similar to Xi Lu's God-Slaying Slash back then. The golden light flashed slightly and then disappeared without a trace, but the clouds in the sky had also completely vanished. Even Nian Bing and others fighting in the air, along with the Archgods, stopped their attacks because of this saber. The overwhelming might generated by the golden lightning's appearance at that instant made everyone's hearts tremble violently.\n\nWhat kind of strength was that! What a ferocious attack! The flame dragon's colossal body stopped its advance at the same moment the golden lightning disappeared. Its massive, deep purple body seemed extremely unwilling, but it could no longer advance even a single inch. A deafening roar that made the entire Lost Continent tremble erupted, and the colossal fire element exploded.\n\nPrince Rong spat blood again, and the thousand mages under his command almost simultaneously collapsed to the ground, blood flowing from the corners of their mouths. Their faces were as pale as paper. They had not only used up all their magic power but also suffered immense spiritual trauma. The instantaneous backlash had rendered them incapable of fighting. Fortunately, Prince Rong and the experts of the Rong family blocked a portion of the backlash energy, which prevented the mages from being completely wiped out.\n\nXi Jie proudly looked at the human army of over a hundred thousand appearing before him. At this moment, it seemed as if only he existed between heaven and earth. His heart was filled with confidence. For many years, he had been diligently cultivating, and today, in front of all his enemies and subordinates, he unleashed his true strength – this was the strength that a god should possess! Xi Jie raised the long saber in his hand and shouted, \"Charge!\"\n\nWhen that golden lightning appeared, everything was no longer proceeding according to Luo Rou's plan. Her plan could be described as nearly perfect, without any flaws. And precisely because of this, all the humans were facing a severe problem. Because of Xi Jie's dominant display, the proud nature of all the gods and men was revealed. They charged forward at the fastest speed. Everyone knew that if this group of gods and men, led by an intermediate god, broke through the human ranks, a massacre would ensue.\n\nIn the trench, all the human warriors had crawled out. The wooden planks that Nian Bing had seen earlier were now laid across the trench, preventing the warriors' advance. At the forefront of the formation, the Fire Dragon Knights and Fire Lion Knights of the Huayao Empire coldly watched the approaching enemies. As the most elite cavalry of the Guang Continent, they felt no fear even in this situation. The long lances in their hands were held horizontally. As soon as Luo Rou gave the order, they would launch a deathly charge. Although the enemy was powerful, they were confident they could block these charging gods and men. To defend their honor, what did it matter if they died?",

    "content": "Luo Rou's face was a little pale, but she still didn't panic. Mu Jing stood beside her, and the seven elders of the Blood Lion Sect also stood beside her. Their faces had turned very grim, but at this moment, Luo Rou sent out another signal. This time, what soared into the sky was no longer a bloody cluster of flowers, but a pure white light. A faint, cold aura seemed to bring a bit of coolness to the scorching airflow in the field. And at this very moment, large swathes of blue light points were gathering behind the human team. Among the humans, apart from the mages belonging to the Rong family, another powerful group of mages moved. They came from—the Ice God Tower.\n\nThe head of the Ice God Tower was the new Priestess of Ice and Snow, Bing Ling. However, Bing Ling was currently fighting alongside Bing Jie in front of the main gods, and Lan Chen was also in that battle. Therefore, the one currently presiding over the Ice God Tower's attack was the临时* substitute, Long Ling. The female dragon, Long Ling. As one of Nian Bing's wives, she had always been the most low-key. But this did not mean her strength was weak. Under Nian Bing's guidance and constant arduous training, Long Ling had made extremely significant progress during this period. Her Heavenly Eye acupoint had even entered the intermediate stage earlier than Feng Nu and Lan Chen, and her ice magic strength had surpassed level twelve, reaching the level of a Divine Descent Master. Although she was still some distance from level thirteen, this distance was no longer too far. Therefore, she had now become the temporary leader of the Ice God Tower.\n\nAfter arriving on the Lost Continent, Long Ling learned a great deal from Bing Ling. Bing Ling was very satisfied with her three daughters-in-law. She liked the gentle and quiet Long Ling and unreservedly imparted her understanding of ice magic to her, including methods for commanding large-scale magical attacks from the Ice God Tower.\n\nThe mages of the Ice God Tower were not as numerous as those of the Rong family. However, their individual strength was something the mages of the Rong family could not compare to. Therefore, although there were only a little over a hundred of them, the attacking power they unleashed was only slightly less than that of the Rong family. In Luo Rou's plan, the mages of the Ice God Tower were the reserve force for all the attacks this time. Whichever side encountered problems, they would assist that side. At this juncture, Luo Rou had to deploy her final trump card, otherwise, it would be too late. Once the enemy charged forward and mixed with their own warriors, the advantage of the mages would completely disappear.\n\nXi Jie watched his subordinate army charge forward, a satisfied glint in his eyes. He knew that besides the powerful individuals in the air, the primary means of attack for the opponent should come from those mages, and only those mages could pose a threat to his subordinates. Now, those mages should have lost their ability to cast magic. As long as they charged forward, even though the opponent was numerous, his subordinates were all divine beings. Although most were servants of gods, they were enough to deliver a devastating blow to the opponent. Since the Yang Guang Continent dared to intercept him here, he would annihilate their elite in one fell swoop, saving further trouble when he reached the Yang Guang Continent.\n\nIt wasn't that Xi Jie didn't want to charge forward with his subordinates. Although he appeared infinitely glorious on the surface, only he knew that resisting that fire dragon earlier had not been comfortable. The massive fire-elemental energy was, after all, condensed by thousands of mages, and it wasn't something that could be destroyed just like that. He had used his full strength in the final blow just now, which was how he broke through the opponent's attack. The earth had completely cracked in the sudden explosion, and at least two-thirds of the surrounding hills had been leveled in the explosion. Xi Jie's body had also suffered a certain degree of internal injury. He had always cherished his body extremely. Feeling the fiery airflow within his body and the significantly weakened battle qi, he floated in the air, directing his subordinates while slowly recovering his energy.\n\nJust then, Xi Jie saw the large cluster of condensed blue light points. They had not been affected by the previous fire magic, and the magical elements in the air seemed very normal. Judging by the intensity of the condensation of the blue light points, this was clearly another large-scale magic. Xi Jie's expression changed slightly. From the news brought back by Xia Yu, he had not received information about so many powerful existences in the human world. Looking at the gradually forming ice magic, he had to stop recovering his body and fly forward. At this moment, he also understood that every subordinate he lost would reduce the strength of the divine being army. Therefore, he had to protect his subordinates as much as possible.\n\nAs Xi Jie charged forward, he suddenly felt a sense of unease because he suddenly remembered that there seemed to be a strong force within his divine being army that had not yet made a move. Suddenly, a flash of inspiration struck his mind, and his eyes revealed intense anger. However, at this moment, he was no longer able to turn back to rescue.\n\nYes, when the mages of the Ice God Tower moved, the Dragon Clan members at the rear, led by the Dragon God, attacked the divine beings from behind. From the moment they first encountered the ambush until now, only a short ten minutes had passed. In ten minutes, the divine beings had successively endured concentrated long-range fire, sneak attacks from human powerhouses like Nian Bing, and the bombardment of ultimate magic. Although the Seven Dragon Kings were assisting Nian Bing's side, the divine beings had not had much time to think. Therefore, even though Xi Jie remembered the potential changes in the Dragon Clan at this time, after weighing the pros and cons, he still had to confront the magical attack in front.\n\nThe Dragon God had been waiting for an opportunity. Originally, he wanted to move when Nian Bing and the others engaged the main gods. Others might not know Xi Jie's strength, but he knew it very clearly. However, when Xi Jie suddenly appeared below, he had to abandon that thought. In that situation, if he attacked Xi Jie, he might have triggered magic and been subjected to the fierce pounce of the giant fire dragon. Therefore, he could only wait. And now, as Xi Jie charged forward to meet the approaching ice magic, it was undoubtedly the best opportunity. Led by the Dragon God, dozens of dragons from the Dragon Clan together pounced towards the divine beings at the very rear.\n\nAt this moment, all the demigod-level experts among the divine beings were at the forefront. They had even forgotten that there were still dragons behind them. The Dragon God was also a main god-level expert! The destructive power generated by his leading the Dragon Clan's attack, though not as great as when Nian Bing and the other powerhouses attacked simultaneously, still caused immense trouble for the divine beings due to the surprise attack, especially when they were facing servants of gods. Moreover, at this time, a small figure was sitting on a giant dragon. The magical beasts that had disappeared earlier reappeared.\n\nWhen the main gods above reacted, Nian Bing led the powerhouses of the Yang Guang Continent and activated spatial magic scrolls. Only Maomao chose a different direction from them, going behind all the divine beings. With the cover of the dragons, no one noticed her. This was precisely the time to strike while the iron was hot, so how could she not appear? Hu Li's vast area of assistance ability was activated once more. This time, not only did the magical beasts produce strong attacking power under the intense stimulation, but even the Dragon Clan was affected. The dense stench caused the Dragon Clan to enter a state similar to berserk. And this state was something the Dragon Clan themselves had not expected. However, the increase in attack power was extremely obvious.\n\nNalan shook the spikes behind its tail and tiredly lay on the back of the nine-tailed dragon, Xiao Jieba. The ultimate stink bomb support magic it had unleashed with all its might had now made it very weak. However, its lewd gaze seemed satisfied with its masterpiece, after all, so many giant dragons had become the attacking power of its support magic. If the Dragon God hadn't reacted quickly, he probably would have been tainted by the stench as well.\n\nMaomao sat on Xiao Jieba's back and directed these giant magical beasts in battle with her mental power. Although Xiao Jieba was the strongest, he rarely participated in the early stages because his main task was to protect Maomao from harm. After all, besides her own mental magic, Maomao's body was too fragile.\n\nFaint blue light points condensed into a giant ice lotus. In the past, the main god Xia Yu had split the ice lotus with all his might, but he himself had been injured. Otherwise, he wouldn't have chosen to explode his acupoints when facing Nian Bing later.\n\nAnd now, the one who had to face this ice lotus was Xi Jie.\n\nThe ice lotus appeared when all the divine beings were still five hundred zhang away from the human warriors. It almost blocked all the space from the front. The blue light filled with cold energy surged out, and the ground condensed into a thick layer of solid ice.\n\nXi Jie's eyes flashed with cold light. Of course, he knew that the faster he dealt with this magic, the faster he could deal with the matters concerning the dragons behind him. If it were under normal circumstances, the Dragon God would not be a threat to him, but now it was different. The giant fire dragon earlier had caused him considerable depletion. The Dragon God's strength was around the middle tier among all the main gods, but he possessed the Dragon Clan's formidable body and dragon language magic. Even killing him would not be an easy task for Xi Jie. Therefore, he was feeling a bit anxious now.\n\nThe Dragon God was also racing against time. The main gods and god-level experts in the air were already entangled by Nian Bing and the others. Before Xi Jie could return to reinforce them, it was the best time to strike these divine beings. Since the Dragon Clan settled on the Divine Continent, the Dragon God had never had any good feelings towards these divine beings. Especially after the Divine Inheritance War ended, he was even more disappointed with these divine beings. If it weren't for the restraint of the main gods based on their strength, he probably would have led his tribe away long ago. And now, this was clearly the best opportunity. Xi Jie had once proposed letting the Dragon Clan become mounts for powerful divine beings, but it was rejected by the Dragon God. He would rather the Dragon Clan be destroyed than let his tribesmen become mounts for these divine beings. Otherwise, once a contract was signed, it would be impossible to undo it.\n\nAlthough the lifespan of divine beings was not infinite, powerful divine beings had as long a lifespan as the Dragon Clan. Once they became their mounts, wouldn't they be enslaved for life?\n\nOne by one, dragon language magics exploded amidst the Dragon God's low roar. The divine beings in front were attracted by the giant ice flower. They naturally hoped to witness Xi Jie's might once more and completely destroy the opponent's magic. Therefore, it was already a little late when they noticed the sneak attack from the dragons behind them. This dragon clan's attack was unlike the Seven Dragon Kings attacking in human form. They relied entirely on their physical bodies and crazy dragon breath, launching the strongest charge. Most divine beings had no idea that the seven handsome men and women who had previously sneak attacked their side were actually incarnations of the Dragon Kings. After all, the Dragon Kings had always been on the Yang Guang Continent and were unfamiliar to them. Therefore, apart from Xi Jie, who had woken up, none of the divine beings could have imagined that such a massive force would suddenly appear behind them. Thus, the servants of gods were unlucky. The dragons, like scythes, continuously harvested their lives. By the time the servants of gods finally realized something was wrong and fought back, seven or eight hundred servants of gods had already died in the surprise attack of the Dragon Clan. And this number was still increasing. After all, although the servants of gods organized themselves to resist the Dragon Clan's attack, the gap in strength was so obvious. If it weren't for the special protective gear made from some special minerals they wore, the Dragon Clan's slaughter would have been even easier, as it was under the leadership of a main god! The gap between a main god and servants of gods was too vast. Almost every move and every magic cast by the Dragon God could take away the lives of at least several to dozens of servants of gods.\n\nXi Jie's giant golden saber was raised again. The ice lotus only appeared for an instant before meeting the same fate as the giant fire dragon. It was also golden lightning, and the ice lotus, whose strength was inferior to the giant fire dragon, shattered almost instantly. However, this time, the Ice God Tower was much luckier than the mages of the Rong family; the backlash they suffered was much smaller.\n\nIt wasn't that Xi Jie showed mercy, but that the golden lightning he unleashed this time was much weaker in terms of attack power.\n\nAfter the golden light flashed, Xi Jie flew back without any pause, meeting the Dragon God and the Dragon Clan who were continuously slaughtering. Under his command, the divine beings were also divided into two groups. One group, led by the demigods, about more than two thousand people, charged towards the warriors of the Yang Guang Continent. More, however, rushed back to encircle and suppress the elite of the Dragon Clan. After all, it was better to pacify the internal enemies before dealing with external ones. In this situation, it was the last thing Xi Jie wanted to see. Although the divine beings were powerful, the feeling of being attacked from both front and back was definitely not easy.",

    "content": "The Twin Gazers, Dragon\n\nA powerful aura locked onto the being before him, shimmering with golden-red light.\n\nThe great dragon, over ten zhang long.\n\nXi Jie’s eyes were filled with anger.\n\n“Why? Why choose betrayal?”\n\nThe Dragon God’s massive dragon eyes looked coldly.\n\n“We dragons have never truly belonged to the Great Continent of Zhen. There’s no such thing as betrayal.”\n\nXi Jie, in your heart, you perhaps always believed divine humans were the strongest.\n\nBut, there’s one thing I must tell you.\n\nIn this world, nothing is absolute. The Continent of Yangguang is the last pure land in our world.\n\nI absolutely cannot watch it be destroyed by selfish fellows like you. Dragons always stand on the side of justice.\n\nIt is precisely because I was too hesitant that the Lost Continent suffered the destruction of its civilization.\n\nBut I will never let the same situation occur again. Xi Jie, you will never understand my thoughts.”\n\nGolden light continuously flashed on the divine-grade long saber. A layer of golden armor gradually condensed on Xi Jie. The anger in his eyes subsided, replaced by a cold, death-filled chill. He did not watch the ongoing slaughter of divine humans by the dragons. He knew that only by killing the Dragon God before him could he stop the dragon slaughter below. But how could killing a Lord God be easy? Thus, he had unleashed his full strength.\n\nXi Jie’s body suddenly became ethereal. Without another word to the Dragon God, he launched his attack. Faint golden phantoms appeared in almost every corner around the Dragon God’s body. Those golden blades, carrying immense battle qi, launched a deadly assault on the Dragon God.\n\nThe Dragon God appeared calm. His gaze did not follow the faint golden figures. A circle of golden-red light instantly erupted from within the Dragon God, forming a halo that spread outwards. The Dragon God did not possess the Heavenly Eye or Cloud Listening acupoints to discern the direction of the enemy’s attacks. All he could do was launch indiscriminate attacks, releasing his powerful dragon might in every direction. Only this way could he temporarily block Xi Jie’s assault.\n\nAs the Dragon God and Xi Jie clashed, the battle in the air had also entered a white-hot state. The might of the four Lord Gods exceeded Nian Bing’s calculations. He was surprised to find that each of these four expressionless Lord Gods was stronger than Xia Yu and Gu Long from back then. Moreover, although their fighting styles were simple, their attack power was extremely difficult to resist. Clearly, they all possessed the ultimate realm of the Imperial Acupoint. Coupled with the eighteen divine-level experts, the combined attack was too powerful.\n\nNow, the strong individuals on Nian Bing’s side had all entered full-force attacks, including the seven Blade Souls and Oscar. They launched wave after wave of attacks, suppressing their opponents from the front. However, led by the four Lord Gods, the divine humans formed a massive barrier. No matter from which angle Nian Bing and the others attacked, they were blocked.\n\nThe Dragon Language Magic of the seven Dragon Kings continuously erupted into spheres of colorful light in the air. Unfortunately, their magic was always unable to achieve a destructive effect. Nian Bing and Bing Ling, Bing Jie were at the rear. Bing Jie, with her mid-stage Imperial Acupoint, could ensure her own safety as long as it wasn’t a full-force attack from a Lord God. However, Bing Ling could not. Among the strong individuals on the Continent of Yangguang’s side, she was the weakest. Nian Bing had to split his attention to protect his mother, lest she suffer any harm. This was a reluctant action, but one he had to take.\n\nXi Lu became the sharpest blade on the Continent of Yangguang’s side. Relying on his strength and the formidable attack power of the God-Slaying Axe, he could often disperse the battle qi emanating from the opponents’ Imperial Acupoints when facing these Lord Gods. In his previous encounter with a Lord God, Xi Lu had sustained considerable damage. Although he had used his full strength then, he was still no match for a Lord God’s single strike. However, he was different now. After continuous arduous cultivation during these days, he had discovered the secret within the God-Slaying Axe. After his body merged with the Axe Soul of the God-Slaying Axe, his strength increased dramatically. This was why Nian Bing said he had entered the fourteenth rank. If it were a one-on-one fight, Xi Lu, who had just entered the fourteenth rank, was clearly not an opponent for any of the Lord Gods. But now, he didn’t need to care about his surroundings; he only needed to unleash his full attacking power.\n\nGalamantis let out a fierce roar. The red light flickered and dimmed significantly. He exchanged a blow with a divine-level expert. Although he tore the opponent’s arms, he also received a solid kick directly to his chest. If not for the strong defense of the dragon race, that kick might have claimed his life. Even so, Galamantis was heavily injured and temporarily withdrew from the battle circle.\n\nThe seven Dragon Kings had cooperated for many years. With one suddenly missing, their strength diminished considerably. Although Katjeosis, with his combat power approaching the fourteenth rank, cooperated with Hei Wu Huang to fend off most of the enemy’s attacks, the Continent of Yangguang’s side gradually fell into a disadvantage.\n\nNian Bing knew it was time for him to unleash that kind of attack. Although Hei Wu Huang had warned him not to use mental attacks lightly unless absolutely necessary, as it could easily lead to backlash, at this moment, if he didn’t act, his allies might suffer fatal blows. Nian Bing did not wish to see anyone on his side get hurt; these were his family and friends! Therefore, standing beside his mother, he continued to fully release his Heavenly Eye Domain. His eyes quietly turned golden, and spiritual fluctuations began to intensify around his body.\n\nThe four golden lights brought by the four Lord Gods, like swimming dragons, not only blocked the attacks of Hei Wu Huang, the Dark Dragon King Katjeosis, and Xi Lu, but also blocked part of the attacks from the Blade Souls and the other Dragon Kings. If not for the powerful ice magic continuously released by the sisters Bing Jie and Bing Ling beside Nian Bing, which made them hesitant, their killing intent would have ignited long ago. At this moment, the four Lord Gods simultaneously sensed Nian Bing’s spiritual fluctuations.\n\nA tall Lord God, but with a snow-white head, suddenly shouted, “Beware of mental attacks. Fortify your minds. Mental solidification.” At his reminder, all the divine-level experts’ hearts tightened simultaneously. And Nian Bing’s mental attack appeared at this moment.\n\nA faint golden light, like a long arrow, rose into the air. Immediately after, it transformed into a faint shadow and shot towards a divine-level expert. With Nian Bing’s current acupoint capabilities, his materialized mental attack combined with the power of the Imperial Acupoint would be a headache even for Xi Jie. He was no longer the Nian Bing who killed lizards on the Divine Continent. Under the full lock of the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, as long as he fixed his target, his materialized mental attack would definitely hit.\n\nThe golden light flashed and disappeared without even a scream. The divine-level expert’s head instantly burst into a spray of blood, instantly killed. At the same time, Nian Bing’s body staggered, and his mind felt a wave of dizziness. Under the Lord Gods’ warning, every divine-level expert had strengthened their mental power. Although Nian Bing’s mental power was much stronger than theirs, forcefully breaking in would not come without a price.\n\nThe death of one divine-level expert instantly reduced the pressure on the Continent of Yangguang’s strong individuals.\n\nBut the reduction was only for an instant.\n\nThe attacks of the four Lord Gods suddenly became even more powerful.\n\nTwo of the Lord Gods’ speeds suddenly increased dramatically. Their ethereal bodies shot towards everyone. The remaining six Dragon Kings hurriedly launched Dragon Language Magic, consuming more dragon power at the cost of large-area attacks to barely block them. The other two Lord Gods emitted pure milky-white light, greatly increasing the defensive power of the divine human side. For a time, they actually managed to block the full-force attacks of two ice mages cooperating with Xi Lu and the Blade Souls.\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath. He naturally knew what that was – the ultimate Earth Spirit Acupoint and the ultimate Square Armor. Lord Gods were Lord Gods after all! And the Lord Gods’ movements clearly gave the divine-level divine humans stronger attacking impetus. The attacks of various colors became monotonous. They also activated their acupoint abilities, and their offense and defense suddenly became even more robust.\n\nNian Bing floated in mid-air. The auxiliary abilities of the Heavenly Eye Domain were once again amplified. Simultaneously, his materialized mental attacks were launched again. To regain the disadvantage, this time he attacked two divine-level experts. Nian Bing was very clear that with his materialized mental power, he could only destroy one Lord God’s combat power. Once he destroyed any one of the Lord Gods before him, his mental power would be greatly reduced. It would be difficult to destroy any other Lord God, and he would probably face unbearable pressure. And without the assistance of his Heavenly Eye Domain, the remaining two Lord Gods would likely be unstoppable by his allies. Only with the effect of the Heavenly Eye Domain could Xi Lu, Hei Wu Huang, and Katjeosis block the opponents’ attacks. Therefore, after weighing the pros and cons, he prioritized maintaining the Heavenly Eye Domain and could only use materialized mental power to attack those divine-level experts.\n\nTwo faint golden lights flashed and disappeared. Two more sprays of bloody-red light erupted. The Heavenly Eye Domain visibly weakened. It would take some time to recover to its peak. And Nian Bing’s body, if not for the support of his mother, almost fell from the sky. His brain instantly fell into a void. If not for his firm will, the Heavenly Eye Domain might have stopped releasing. The backlash from attacking two divine-level experts simultaneously was even more severe. He knew that if he wanted to continue maintaining the Heavenly Eye Domain, he absolutely could not use materialized mental attacks anymore.\n\nThe divine humans naturally saw Nian Bing’s situation, but a certain panic still arose amongst them. After all, three instant kills, three divine-level experts lost their lives just like that, creating immense pressure in their hearts. Apart from the four Lord Gods, the other divine humans hesitated. Would they become that guy’s next target? The hesitation caused their attacks to weaken significantly.\n\nAt this moment, the six Dragon Kings and Xi Lu were all wounded. The radiance on the seven Blade Souls had also dimmed considerably. Only the auxiliary effect of Nian Bing’s Heavenly Eye Domain had not weakened. On the contrary, although the divine humans maintained a balanced state, Nian Bing’s side lost in terms of everyone’s strength, while they lost divine human lives. Every flash of that faint golden light took away a life. Panic had arisen in their hearts. The deaths of three divine humans, plus one who had lost his ability to attack because Galamantis destroyed his arms, although still alive, had been removed from the battle. Let alone now, even in the future, it would be difficult to be a divine-level expert.\n\nThe battle in the air became increasingly fierce, while the battle between the Dragon God and Xi Jie below was even more brutal. The Dragon God already bore dozens of wounds that went bone-deep. His dragon body’s defense power was considerable, and he was protected by dragon power, but facing Xi Jie’s divine-grade golden saber, it was very difficult to truly resist. Their battle remained in the state it was at the beginning. The Dragon God continuously released his Dragon Language Magic and dragon skills, still attacking in all directions. Xi Jie’s body, however, remained ethereal. Relying on his speed, he sought flaws within the Dragon God’s comprehensive attacks. Although he held an absolute advantage, the Dragon God’s constantly advancing body and fully released Dragon Language Magic brought considerable losses to the divine humans below. Coupled with the frenzied attacks of Mao Mao and the dragons, the losses suffered by the divine humans were gradually increasing.\n\nWhat about the more than two thousand divine humans who charged towards the human warriors? They charged in. They had already broken into the human warriors’ formation, but it was not more than two thousand divine humans who managed to charge in. Only twelve hundred divine humans were able to charge into the human formation in the end. Because, as they charged in, they encountered the obstruction of the God-Slaying Crossbows. After the God-Slaying Crossbows retreated, they directly moved to the human army. Seeing the charge of the divine humans, the God-Slaying Crossbows released massive energy.",

    "content": "If not for the semi-divine experts at the very front holding the line, the gods would have suffered even greater losses. Of course, the nearly thousand fallen gods weren't solely due to the God-Slaying Crossbows. Within a certain range, the gods had dispersed completely, no longer giving the God-Slaying Crossbows a chance to unleash their full power. It was then that the two strongest knightly orders of the Huaron Empire charged out, burning with the flame of honor in their hearts. They broke from the battle formation and charged.\n\nThe strength of the gods was once again displayed before everyone. The Blazing Dragon Knights, each knight meticulously selected, possessed their own Dragon Lances and Earth Dragon mounts. The Blazing Lion Knights were the strongest cavalry of the Rising Sun Continent, second only to the Dragon Knights. What was their fate now? Simple: death.\n\nThe two knightly orders, after a single charge, paid the price with total annihilation. Led by over a hundred semi-divine experts, these knights were given no significant opportunities. They could only take hundreds of divine lives with their fierce impact before disappearing forever from this desolate land.\n\nThe Huaron Empire's finest knightly orders, forged with countless effort and resources, were destroyed just like that. Prince Rong, who had just recovered some strength, saw this scene and spewed blood, collapsing into a coma.\n\nOut of over two thousand gods, nearly a thousand were lost, most of them falling to the dual ice and fire explosive kill of the God-Slaying Crossbows. The contribution of the two elite knightly orders was meager in comparison. At this moment, the human warriors raised their weapons. No one retreated; they all thought of their families. If these god-like beings were allowed to reach the Rising Sun Continent, what would that scene be like? Therefore, even though they knew it was a suicide mission, they still raised their weapons and launched a desperate resistance against the gods. At this point, individual strength became evident. Although there were only twelve hundred gods, they brought the call of death.\n\nThe number of human warriors was rapidly decreasing. In the early stages of the battle, the gods suffered almost no losses. The semi-divine experts were practically invincible, each attack easily taking over ten human warrior lives. By this point, they were seeing red. The resentment accumulated from being suppressed by magic and crossbows was fully unleashed. In their hearts, only blood could release their hatred.\n\nHowever, the gods' rampaging did not last long. The tide of battle shifted from a one-sided slaughter to a stalemate because the elites of the Blood Lion Cult appeared. Two thousand elites of the Blood Lion Cult, along with five hundred Blood Guards using God-Slaying Crossbows and a hundred experts from the Ice Moon Hall, led by the seven elders and five hall masters of the Blood Lion Cult, appeared among the Rising Sun Continent warriors surrounding the gods, employing a sniping strategy. Their appearance immediately reduced the rate at which the human warriors were being killed, and the numbers of the twelve hundred gods began to decrease gradually.\n\nNotably, the most significant impact wasn't from the Martial Saint-level experts. The elders of the Blood Lion Cult, along with other high-level experts, were facing semi-divine experts who were slightly stronger than themselves. They could only barely withstand the opponents' attacks through a life-for-life struggle. It was the Blood Guards who began reaping enemy lives for the Rising Sun Continent. Yes, it was those five hundred Blood Guards, forged in iron and blood.\n\nThe Blood Guards never wore armor. They always wore dark red warrior robes, just as their weapons, the rapier, were always sharp. Their rapiers possessed not only strong penetrative power but also a potent poison. Their entry was a nightmare for the gods. The divine servant-level gods began to suffer increasing casualties from the Blood Guards' sneak attacks.\n\nIn the eyes of the Blood Guards, any means were permissible to achieve their goals. Often, as a human warrior was being killed by a divine servant, their rapier would silently emerge from under the human warrior's arm. With a full-force thrust, even if their own bodies were pierced by the divine servant's weapon at the same time, their attack would not pause for an instant. The Blood Guards represented a spirit; they utterly disregarded their own lives. As long as they had a breath left, their attacks would not cease.\n\nWhile the Blazing Dragon Knights and Blazing Lion Knights were strong in battle and possessed great charge power, their charge was of little use in direct confrontation with experts. In the previous battle, it was precisely because the semi-divine experts at the forefront completely contained their charge's explosive power that they were annihilated. Their full potential was not realized. However, the Blood Guards were different. They were the elite force of the Blood Lion Cult, and in previous battles, their primary targets had always been stronger experts, making their tactics the most effective against these gods.\n\nThe Blood Guards were like cunning venomous snakes, always hidden in dark corners, but their sudden attacks always yielded results, and their gains were enemy lives. To achieve these gains, they sometimes had to pay with their own lives.\n\nWith the addition of the Blood Guards, the battle was fully locked in a stalemate. The hundreds of thousands of troops from the Rising Sun Continent surrounded and fought the remaining thousand-plus gods. Although they inflicted minimal damage on the gods, their steadfast belief in protecting the Rising Sun Continent allowed them to face these powerful gods without fear. If not for the presence of those hundred semi-divine experts among the gods, they would likely have been annihilated long ago. However, their absolute strength meant the Rising Sun Continent's army gained no advantage; for every god they killed, they paid with the lives of several, or even dozens or hundreds. This was the result even in the chaotic melee.\n\nThe battle continued in a stalemate, with casualties occurring in three different aspects. The casualties in the air were clearly the least. After Nian Bing's mental power was significantly weakened and vibrated, both sides could only inflict damage, not fatal blows. No one could pinpoint a decisive battle on either side, but it could be said that the outcome of any one aspect of the battle would influence the overall situation.\n\nThe numbers of nearly six thousand gods sharply declined under the onslaught of the dragons. Without gods of semi-divine level or higher to help them face the dragons, they had almost no chance. The dragons' solid defenses meant they were immune to fatal damage, but their breaths and powerful physical attacks were a nightmare for the gods before them.\n\nAmidst the ensuing chaos, on Luo Rou's side, a low chant began, not loud, completely drowned out by the sounds of battle. However, the remaining less than a thousand gods did not know that this inconspicuous, low chant determined their fate.\n\nA layer of pale green mist began to spread through the air, covering the Rising Sun Continent's army and the gods, causing a flicker of shock in both warring factions. The gods cautiously retreated a little, but they soon discovered that this green mist, filled with an eerie aura, had no effect on them. After several probes, they revealed their ferocious side again, rejoining the battle to continue their slaughter. But they soon realized something was wrong.\n\nBroken and incomplete corpses gradually rose from the ground. They were the fallen Blazing Dragon Knights and Blazing Lion Knights, as well as other fallen warriors from the Rising Sun Continent and the Blood Guards. Their auras became abnormally cold, some still dripping blood. An ominous aura filled the entire battlefield. All human warriors, under Luo Rou's command, retreated rapidly. The reanimated warriors, however, charged forward fearlessly. Facing the attacks of the gods, they felt no pain. Their methods were entirely suicidal. Unless their bodies were completely shattered, even if only their heads remained, they would bite at their opponents. Their combat power instantly increased. The gods were not only physically struck, but their hearts also trembled. Attacking them were their former comrades. What was this? What were these things? Under the influence of the pale green mist, the balance of the battle on Luo Rou's side began to tilt.\n\nYouyou stood pale-faced amidst the crowd. She was not tall. Aside from Ping Chao, who guarded her, even the warriors on the Rising Sun Continent's side were unaware that everything before them was the power of this young girl. The pale green mist was released by Youyou. How she wished she didn't have to use this magic! But the reality was that she still had to. Because too many people had already died.\n\n\"Ah! This is necromancy! We must find the necromancer!\" a semi-divine god shouted in terror. They could easily kill human warriors, but it was not easy to turn all humans into fragments, let alone the fact that this undead army numbered tens of thousands. These tens of thousands had all died by their hands, but now they had become their enemies. Overwhelming resentment surged. Under the charge of the undead army, who knew nothing of death, the gods began to retreat, growing somewhat fearful.\n\nLuo Rou raised her hand once more. In her hand was the token Nian Bing had given her. The two thousand elites Nian Bing had given her were now less than fifteen hundred. The five hundred Blood Guards had only two hundred survivors. Despite the heavy casualties, the deaths of the Blood Guards were worthy of pride, because each Blood Guard had killed at least one god, a god stronger than them.\n\nLuo Rou closed her eyes. As tears flowed down her cheeks and dripped onto the ground, she issued the order, \"God-Slaying Arrows, target ahead, dual ice and fire explosive kill. Fire.\" A total of two hundred God-Slaying Crossbows, due to casualties, could barely muster nearly a hundred to unleash their power. The warriors of the Blood Lion Cult only knew to follow orders, even if their God-Slaying Arrows targeted their fallen brothers. The massive crossbows were drawn, and incredibly powerful bolts of red and blue light were loaded. At Luo Rou's sudden gesture, dozens of forbidden-level arrows unleashed their full power.\n\nWith the targeting scope designed by the Dwarf King Jiu Lu, all arrows hit their mark without fail. They completed their mission. The magic lights exploded in the midst of the remaining hundreds of gods and tens of thousands of undead warriors. The immense power of the forbidden spells created an open space there.\n\nThese remaining hundreds of gods were completely surrounded by undead warriors. Then, such intense magic exploded from above their heads. They could finally no longer resist. After leaving behind hundreds more corpses, only those semi-divine gods with stronger power managed to escape the battlefield, numbering no more than a hundred. In this battle, they had lost another two thousand elite gods.\n\nUnder the special care of the Blood Lion Cult warriors, the undead army, affected by the central explosion of the forbidden spells, were only the warriors in the innermost circle. The remaining undead warriors numbered over twenty thousand. Without hesitation, led by the pale green mist, they charged towards the large number of gods battling the dragons. A suicide attack, once initiated, would not stop until all the undead warriors had lost their lives.\n\nThe stronger the undead warrior was in life, the stronger they became as undead. Among these undead warriors, there were now over a thousand god-undead. Under the shroud of the pale green weapons, they all charged towards the remaining gods.\n\nJust then, a roaring dragon's cry suddenly sounded, filled with anger and unwillingness. The Dragon God's massive body slowly fell, a golden saber lodged in its heart.\n\nXi Jie stood before the Dragon God, his chest heaving, gulping great mouthfuls of blood-filled air. At this moment, blood was flowing from all seven of his orifices, his body trembling slightly, his clothes long since torn, revealing muscles like steel. Looking at the Dragon God's enraged eyes before him, he said hatefully, \"Do you regret it?\"\n\nThe Dragon God looked at him with eyes as desolate as death, \"No, I will never regret it. Because only in this way can our dragon race return to the light. Xi Jie, you will not succeed. The warriors of humanity will utterly destroy you despicable fellows from the Divine Continent.\"",

    "content": "Xi Jie gazed deeply at the Dragon God. Under his relentless assault, even the Dragon God, who possessed the Dragon God's Heart Art, was now covered in wounds. His internal organs had been shattered by his own berserk combat energy in this final blow. Yet, his gaze was resolute. Yes, he had no regrets! Facing the Dragon God, with whom he had spent tens of thousands of years, Xi Jie felt a surge of respect. He abruptly drew his golden saber, letting the Dragon God's blood drench him. He could no longer bear to desecrate the Dragon God's body.\n\nSeven mournful dragon roars suddenly erupted. The seven Dragon Kings in the sky, including the heavily injured Galanthis, attacked their opponents with reckless abandon. In their roars, all the dragons let out frenzied wails, and their attacks instantly doubled in intensity. These dragons of the dragon race, like undead warriors, no longer cared about their own safety, launching an exceptionally fierce assault. Their sole target was the direction of the Dragon God.\n\nXi Jie merely swept his gaze across the battlefield and understood what had happened. A golden saber aura slashed out, expanding as it flew through the air, heading straight for those undead warriors. A violent roar erupted, showering the sky with blood. The foremost ten thousand undead warriors were pulverized by this domineering attack. Xi Jie glared hatefully at the distant human army and roared with extreme reluctance, \"Retreat.\"\n\nThe God-Human army truly wanted to retreat; no one could stop them, especially with Xi Jie's commanding presence. But could the dragon race allow them to retreat? Seeing the Dragon God receive a fatal blow, these dragons, who had launched a sneak attack on the God-Humans from behind, had gone mad. They completely disregarded whether they could harm Xi Jie, launching suicidal attacks against him.\n\nAs the sixth dragon died by Xi Jie's golden saber, a dying dragon roar sounded, \"Let them go.\" Blood continuously seeped from beneath the Dragon God's scales. However, his voice was remarkably stable. He gazed deeply at Xi Jie and issued his final command to his kin.\n\nThe dragons' madness had originated from the Dragon God and would also disappear because of him. They simply couldn't bear to refuse their king's final command. All the dragons took flight, including Xiaojieba, who was carrying Maomao. Xiaojieba flapped his golden dragon wings, bringing Maomao along as they ascended into the sky, following the dragons. All the magical beasts were recalled by Maomao at this moment. Although the magical beasts had unleashed great destructive power in the previous battle, the Nine-Tailed Poison Spider was now dead, its body being relatively fragile. The other magical beasts had also sustained varying degrees of injury. The combat energy of the God-Humans was not just for show.\n\nThe main gods battling Nian Bing and the others, upon receiving Xi Jie's command, immediately launched a fierce attack. But what shocked them was that the seven Dragon Kings before them seemed to be fighting with no regard for their lives, stubbornly blocking their attacks in coordination with others. After claiming the life of another divine-level expert, they managed to break free from the battlefield. They rendezvoused with Xi Jie below and fled rapidly.\n\nThe God-Humans came quickly and left just as fast. In a short while, the remaining four thousand and some God-Humans had all retreated, leaving behind only bloodstains and corpses everywhere.\n\nThe battlefield fell into silence. Galanthis spat out another mouthful of blood, but without any pause, he rushed below. Arriving beside his father, the seven Dragon Kings all landed around him. Nian Bing, along with all the powerhouses from the Yang Guang Continent's side, gathered around the Dragon God's mountain-like body.\n\nLuo Rou, in the distance, turned away, unable to bear watching this scene any longer. She ordered her subordinates, the generals, to begin integrating the Yang Guang Continent's army.\n\nThe dragons of the dragon race also descended from the sky, encircling the seven Dragon Kings. They all lowered their proud heads, their massive dragon bodies prostrating on the ground, expressing their sorrow in silence.\n\nGalanthis stepped before the Dragon God, grasping his father's colossal front claw. \"Father, you must hold on! You'll be fine. Our dragon race still needs your leadership.\"\n\nThe Dragon God's gaze softened as he looked at his son. \"Galanthis, you're injured.\"\n\nGalanthis shook his head vigorously. \"No, I'm fine. Father, you'll be fine too. Dimantide, Nian Bing, hurry, save my father.\" As he spoke, two golden beams of light enveloped the Dragon God's body. Under the effect of the strongest light healing magic, the terrifying wounds on the Dragon God's body stopped bleeding.\n\nThe Dragon God shook his head. He was now too weak to stand. Looking at the Dragon Kings and Nian Bing and the others before him, he sighed softly, \"Don't waste your efforts. We dragons are different from humans. We inherently possess strong anti-magic attributes and extremely high defense. My internal organs are all damaged. It is my dragon soul supporting me to speak with you now. You should all understand that healing magic has no effect on me.\"\n\n\"No, no, no. It absolutely won't happen. Father, Nian Bing's magic is very powerful. He can definitely cure you,\" Galanthis roared frantically.\n\nAlthough Nian Bing's mental strength was now extremely weak, he was still doing his utmost to cast water and light healing magic. The Life Sphere on his chest also unhesitatingly released its life essence. However, he soon realized that, just as the Dragon God had said, his healing magic had no effect on him. The dragon race's own vitality was already very strong, but now the Dragon God's vitality was rapidly draining. No matter how much he replenished it, he couldn't slow down the rate of this loss. The Dragon God was like a tattered bag with countless holes, beyond repair. Nian Bing's magic, though powerful, was not divine. He knew that even if Cao were here now, he couldn't save the Dragon God's life.\n\n\"Alright, Galanthis, don't trouble Nian Bing anymore. He's already very weak. Stop the healing. Before I completely die, I have a few words for you and Katesiosis.\"\n\nTears streamed down Galanthis's face. Back then, when his father favored Katesiosis, he wasn't sad. When his beloved Dimantide chose Katesiosis, he didn't shed tears. The position of Dragon God, which should have been inherited by him, was also given to Katesiosis. He was still himself, like an unyielding man who couldn't cry. But now, he wept, weeping with sorrow before his dying father. His legs gave way, and Galanthis knelt before the Dragon God, tightly grasping his father's front claw, tears pouring out uncontrollably.\n\nKatesiosis also walked up to the Dragon God. Although his expression was calm, his deep black eyes were filled with sadness. The Dragon God had given him so much. In his heart, the elder he respected most was the Dragon God before him. It was the Dragon God who taught him how to be an excellent dragon and how to be the pride of his race. He knew he could never repay the kindness of the Dragon God. Tears also flowed from the eyes of this outwardly cold Dark Dragon King. Looking at the Dragon God's massive golden-red eyes, he said solemnly, \"Lord Dragon God, please give your orders.\"\n\nThe Dragon God let out a laugh. At this moment, he actually laughed. \"Do you know, Kate, when I chose you back then, I felt it was a bit risky myself. I'm not referring to choosing you as the Dragon God's successor, but to the moment I allowed you to return to the dragon race. After all, your Hell Black Dragon lineage has committed so many wrongdoings in the past. However, I can now proudly say in front of the entire race: My choice was not wrong. After my death, the dragon race will be yours. I believe that under your leadership, our dragon race will prosper even more. After I led our clan's warriors to this continent, our clan's women and children have also departed. Under my command, they will bypass the battlefield and rendezvous with you from the rear. You must find a suitable place and settle our clansmen, allowing our dragon race to survive in a suitable environment. Kate. These matters are entrusted to you.\"\n\n\"Lord Dragon God, I...\" Katesiosis's voice choked, unable to express his inner feelings.\n\nThe Dragon God said, \"Alright, you have now become the Dragon God inheriting my throne. In front of our clansmen, you must be strong, because their fate rests in your hands. Trust me, and trust yourself. You will surely be a qualified Dragon God. Oh, and your child, Oscar. Little Kaka is doing very well. His achievements in the future will surpass yours. I am very fortunate that I didn't punish him back then. My opinion remains unchanged: when you are old, he will inherit the position of the next Dragon God.\"\n\n\"Dragon God Grandpa, I'm here.\" Oscar transformed into human form and lunged in front of the Dragon God, kneeling beside his father. During Nian Bing's time on the Divine Continent, Oscar had always followed the Dragon God to learn. The Dragon God had taught him many things, allowing him to grow more rapidly. Seeing the Dragon God in this state, his heart was filled with sadness and reluctance. However, connected to Nian Bing's soul, he knew that the Dragon God could no longer be saved.\n\nThe Dragon God smiled and looked at Oscar. \"Cultivate diligently. Back then, the destruction of your physical body was not a bad thing; it brought you and Nian Bing together. Nian Bing is the most outstanding human I have ever seen. Becoming his partner will not bury you. One day, you will be as outstanding as your father and become the leader of our dragon race.\"\n\nKatesiosis wiped the tears from his face, stood up, placed his right hand on his forehead, and said solemnly, \"I, Katesiosis, the Dark Dragon King, swear in the name of the Dragon God: for the prosperity and flourishing of the dragon race, I will contribute all my strength until the end of my life.\"\n\nThe Dragon God also spoke with a solemn voice, \"In the name of the former Dragon God, I bestow upon you the honor of inheriting the Dragon God's position. The ancestors are with you. Under your leadership, the dragon race will forever look towards the light.\" A faint golden-red light emerged from the Dragon God's forehead. A small piece of golden crystal floated out and landed on Katesiosis's brow. The faint golden light instantly intensified. When the light receded, the golden crystal had vanished. A kingly aura emanated from Katesiosis. Having inherited the Dragon God's crystal essence, he had now become the true Dragon God.\n\nThe Dragon God, having released the golden crystal, appeared even more weakened. He gazed deeply at Katesiosis before shifting his gaze to his son, who was continuously weeping. \"Galanthis, you must learn from Katesiosis. I can see that you have now become a true man, a man of our dragon race. The Fire Dragon lineage will continue to be led by you. My child, can you tell me, do you still hate me?\"\n\nGalanthis gazed deeply at his father. \"No, I no longer blame you. As I truly grew up, I understood your difficulties. Your choice of Katesiosis was not wrong. He is more suitable to be the Dragon God's successor than I am. He is stronger than me in all aspects. It's just that I was unwilling to admit it due to my own pride. Father, I...\"\n\nThe Dragon God interrupted him. \"Alright, I understand what you mean. Actually, to me, you and Katesiosis are both my children. In terms of talent, you are not much worse than him. But do you know why I have always treated Katesiosis better than you?\"\n\nGalanthis shook his head blankly. The Dragon God smiled faintly. \"That's because you still have me, your father, while Katesiosis is an orphan. You should know that the Hell Black Dragon lineage is naturally solitary. If I didn't show him more care, if I didn't treat him like my own child, how could he grow on the correct path? I have indeed failed you. But in my heart, you are still the most important. Seeing you like this now, I am truly relieved. You are worthy of being my son, and I am also proud of you.\"\n\nGalanthis's tears, which had just stopped, began to flow again. Katesiosis suddenly threw himself onto the Dragon God and wept loudly. Yes, he had always regarded the Dragon God as his father. Just as the Dragon God said, ever since he returned to the dragon race, the Dragon God had treated him even better than his own son. How could he forget this kindness?\n\nThe Dragon God looked gently at his two children and sighed deeply. \"Actually, I knew this outcome would come, but it was unavoidable. Xi Jie is indeed too strong. If I didn't stop him, the outcome of the war would likely have been decided today. Therefore, I had no choice but to do this. My children, I hope you can understand me. For the dragon race, and for the Yang Guang Continent, my sacrifice is worthwhile. Nian Bing, come here.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing strode towards the Dragon God.\n\nBecause he had used his mental power for a physical attack to instantly kill a Divine-level expert, and had also continuously cast the strongest Heavenly Eye Technique, his body was now extremely weak. Therefore, he could only walk and couldn't use instant transfer to quickly arrive before the Dragon God. Looking at the tall and mighty elder before him, Nian Bing wiped the tears from his eyes. He hadn't spent much time with the Dragon God, but his life had essentially been saved by the Dragon God. Back then, if the Dragon God hadn't brought him to the Divine Continent, he would have probably remained a zombie, and how could he have achieved what he had today?\n\nThe Dragon God looked at Nian Bing and said, \"Child, you are very brave. Facing such a powerful army of Divine race¹ experts on the Divine Continent, you and your companions bravely accepted the challenge. The first time I saw you, I predicted that you would become one of the greatest figures in human history. At that time, you used your life to unleash powerful magic and saved these children of mine. From then on, you and our Dragon Clan have had a close relationship. Later, I brought you to the Divine Continent, and your continuous growth surprised me. Now, you have truly grown into a hero of humanity. However, there is one thing I must remind you: you must be extremely careful when facing those Divine race experts.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded firmly and said, \"Dragon God Lord, your sacrifice will not be in vain. You have bought us precious time. I will definitely lead the brave warriors of the Yangguang Continent² to forever keep those detestable bastards outside the Yangguang Continent.\"\n\nThe Dragon God looked deeply at Nian Bing and said, \"In this war, if you want to achieve ultimate victory, you must pay attention to one crucial point. Do you know what it is?\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment and said, \"Is it those God Kings³?\" He naturally knew. The God Kings were powerful and were the decisive factor in this war.\n\nThe Dragon God shook his massive head with difficulty. \"No, it's not those God Kings, but that one God King. It's the King of God Kings—Xijie⁴, who fought me earlier. Although the other God Kings are powerful, you still have the strength to resist them. However, Xijie is different. To be frank, he has already surpassed the realm of a God King. This is not only because he possesses six ultimate realm acupoints, but also because he has completely opened three Imperial Acupoints⁵. I once told you that Imperial Acupoints are not unique. This is why he can be compared to the Heavenly Eye Acupoint. The three Imperial Acupoints, combined with the other five ultimate acupoints, have brought his strength to the level of the fifteenth stage. Otherwise, how could he have blocked so many of your concurrent mage attacks with his own power and still killed me? His strength is truly too great. If you cannot find a way to destroy him, it will be useless even if you kill all other Divine race experts. You must understand that his power alone is enough to completely destroy you. Numbers are of no advantage in front of him.\"\n\nFifteenth stage? Upon hearing this number, Nian Bing's heart skipped a beat. Recalling the golden light that had enveloped Xijie earlier and his invincible aura, Nian Bing's heart grew even heavier. \"Then how should we deal with him? He possesses three Imperial Acupoints; can we possibly contend with him?\"\n\nThe Dragon God said, \"I don't know. I cannot answer this question. Apart from those True Gods⁶, I really can't think of any way to destroy him. But I can remind you that sometimes, the strongest point can also be the weakest point. In today's battle, although he played a significant role and even killed me, he himself was also very severely injured. With his personality, he will not launch a full-scale attack before he has fully recovered, but this time will not exceed ten days. How to prepare depends on yourselves. Miracles often appear only before those who are prepared. I believe you have the courage and determination to do this. Nian Bing, you will always be a friend to our Dragon Clan.\" His voice was filled with relief. Having existed for tens of thousands of years, he had long come to terms with death. He cast a lingering glance at Garamantis⁷, Karjiosis⁸, and his other Dragon Clan members beside him. The Dragon God lowered his great head and passed away with a smile.\n\nThe death of the Dragon God weighed heavily on the heart of every member of the Dragon Clan, and it also cast a shadow over this war. The Dragon God's sacrifice bought the warriors of the Yangguang Continent a chance to recuperate. His death was completely worthwhile. Nian Bing understood this very clearly. If the Dragon God hadn't desperately injured Xijie with his full power, this war might have ended today. Just as the Dragon God had said, although Xijie was just one person, he possessed the ability to destroy everything!\n\nAccording to Dragon Clan customs, a simple ceremony was held for the Dragon God's physical body. His remains were cremated, and his dragon soul and dragon pearl were inherited by his son, Fire Dragon King Garamantis. His dragon armor and dragon bones, which had suffered considerable damage, were collected by the newly appointed Dragon God Karjiosis. Once the Dragon Clan found a suitable resting place, these dragon bones and dragon armor would be interred in the Dragon Tomb.\n\nA somber atmosphere enveloped the entire human allied army. Only after truly witnessing the power of the Divine race did they understand the importance of this war even more. The temporary command tent was still occupied by representatives of the four great empires discussing matters. However, one of the representatives had been replaced.\n\nRong Yue⁹'s eyes revealed worry. He sighed softly, \"We prepared so adequately, yet we still suffered such heavy losses. It seems we still underestimated the strength of these Divine race experts.\"\n\nLuo Rou¹⁰ lowered her head and said, \"The mistake this time is mine. My underestimation of the enemy led to this situation.\"\n\nNian Bing forced himself to conceal the grief brought by the Dragon God's passing and patted Luo Rou's hand. \"No, how can this be your fault? You did nothing wrong. Your plan was already very thorough. It's just that the enemy's strength was too great, which caused this situation. You don't need to blame yourself. If it weren't for your calm command in the face of danger, our losses would probably have been even greater. Uncle, how is Grandpa doing now?\"\n\nRong Yue sighed, \"You should know that the Flame Son Knights¹¹ and the Flame Magic Dragon Knights¹² were your grandfather's life's work. This time, the complete annihilation of these two knight orders dealt a severe blow to him. Furthermore, he suffered too much magical backlash from casting spells for the subordinate mages, causing significant damage to his body. Although he has been treated, he is old after all. It is unlikely he will be able to contribute to this war anymore.\"\n\nHearing Rong Yue say this, Rong Qin¹³ was clearly not in mortal danger. Although Nian Bing felt a little relieved, he knew that this war would become even more difficult. Taking a deep breath to calm himself, he said, \"Now is not the time for sadness. Rou'er, we need to carefully plan our next course of action. Although the first wave of attacks from the Divine race has been repelled by us, this does not mean we have gained an advantage over them. The Dragon God's words before his death left a deep impression on me. To truly defeat these Divine race experts, we must kill those five God Kings. Otherwise, as long as they are still here, disasters may befall the Yangguang Continent. Let's first discuss our respective strengths and weaknesses. Have the casualty reports from our side been submitted?\"\n\nLuo Rou shook her head. \"They should be coming soon. The losses this time were too great, and counting them takes time. They should be compiled shortly. How are the strong individuals on your side doing?\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"The strong individuals on our side have suffered very few losses, or you could say very heavy losses. On our side, there are only a few who can reach the fourteenth stage. Although everyone sustained injuries of varying degrees in the battles against those God Kings and Divine-level experts, they still have the strength to fight again. The situation is not good only for Fire Dragon King Garamantis, my elder brother. His injuries are more serious, and his grief has worsened his condition. Although I have treated him, the Dragon Clan's bodies have extremely strong resistance to magic. If the next attack from the Divine race occurs after ten days, he may not be able to participate. The heavy loss I speak of is the Dragon God. He was an absolute fourteenth-stage expert, almost the strongest on our side. His death has greatly weakened our formidable power. However, with the addition of dozens of great dragons from the Dragon Clan, our overall strength has not weakened too much. At least, this time we have the strength to confront those demigod-level Divine race experts head-on. They are all recuperating now.\"\n\nLuo Rou nodded. \"I am also very saddened by the death of the Dragon God. However, I must say that his death was very valuable. The Dragon God was a wise elder. In that situation, he timely held back the opponent's strongest expert and managed to heavily wound him, allowing us to kill a large number of Divine race experts and weaken their strength. Now, there are two things we need to do. One is to prevent sneak attacks. The Divine race experts probably have no supplies. On this barren continent, they may not be able to hold out for ten days before attacking. The other is to redeploy and be ready at any time to welcome their second wave of attack. Nian Bing, do you remember your concerns? We also need to prepare. If they bypass us from another direction and head straight for the Yangguang Continent, then we will have to redeploy.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"Preventing sneak attacks is necessary, but I disagree with your second point. If it weren't for today's battle, I would have had such concerns. However, through today's battle, I have learned that as long as that God King named Xijie is still around, the Divine race experts will not give up frontal attacks. Today, we inflicted heavy losses on them, mainly because we had prepared ambushes beforehand and had the sudden appearance of the Dragon Clan's power, which allowed us to deliver a devastating blow. However, it will not be so easy next time. As long as those God Kings and Divine-level experts are not separated from the Divine race, and led by a supreme expert like Xijie, it will be difficult for us to gain any advantage. Therefore, I conclude that they will still attack head-on. Only by defeating us can they obtain the supplies they need as quickly as possible.\"\n\nRong Yue nodded in agreement. \"That's right. Nian Bing's words are very reasonable. I also saw the situation at the time. That ultimate magic initiated by my father has always been the strongest attack method of our Rong family. My father, my uncle, and I all participated in it. Such a powerful ultimate magic, cast by so many fire mages, was blocked by a single person. It's truly terrifying. Frankly speaking, I have no confidence in this war. However, we have no chance to retreat now. Only by fighting to the death can there be a sliver of hope.\" They certainly couldn't retreat now. Although the human warriors had many cavalrymen, how could the horses outrun those powerful Divine race experts? Once they retreated, with their morale declining, they would inevitably be slaughtered by the Divine race experts. Therefore, they had no retreat route now. Fortunately, the warriors of the Yangguang Continent had continuous supplies from the rear. Through the spatial teleportation created by Nian Bing, supplies could be replenished at any time. Just as Luo Rou had said before, if they could continue to wear down the enemy, it would undoubtedly be very beneficial to the Yangguang Continent.\n\nMu Jing¹⁴, who had been silent all along, suddenly spoke. \"Then how should we deploy now? Since those Divine race experts have already fought with us, when they come again next time, any ambush will probably be useless. We can only confront them head-on. However, it will be difficult for us to withstand their frontal assault, won't it?\"\n\nJust as Nian Bing was about to speak, several people walked in from outside, including Nian Bing's father, Rong Tian¹⁵, Luo Rou's and Mu Jing's subordinates, as well as a major general under Marshal Xue Po¹⁶ and the hall master of the Blood Lion Sect, Yin Dang¹⁷.\n\nThe five people who entered came to the side of the five seated individuals and whispered a few words, then quietly withdrew. Rong Tian glanced at Nian Bing and gave his son an encouraging look. Judging from his father's pale face, it was evident that he had also sustained some injuries during the previous fierce attack.\n\nThe purpose of the five people who entered was to report the losses of their respective headquarters.\n\nEveryone's expression became solemn, especially Rong Yue. A slight distortion appeared on his handsome face, and his eyes showed pain.\n\nLuo Rou said, \"I'll speak first. Our country lost about six thousand soldiers in this battle, with three thousand wounded, most of whom were severely injured and unlikely to fight again. The Magic Crystal Cannon unit, designed by me, was completely annihilated. All one hundred and twenty mages died.\" The thought of her magic crystal cannons made Luo Rou's heart ache. Those were ultimate weapons created at the cost of the Oulan Empire's national strength! This time, after firing only once, they were completely lost. How could she not feel heartbroken?",

    "content": "Mu Le said expressionlessly, \"Relatively speaking, our country's losses are smaller. Four thousand warriors died, and about seventy to eighty mages died from backlash from combat qi and scattered attacks from the gods. Approximately three thousand warriors were wounded, most of them severely and unable to fight again.\"\n\nXue Po said, \"The Ice Moon Empire lost nearly seven thousand warriors. The others are similar to the Oran Empire. However, the mages from our Ice God Tower, apart from having their magic power greatly depleted, did not have their combat effectiveness reduced. This might be the only good news.\" When Xi Jie shattered the Ice Lotus, his strength had weakened somewhat due to the excessive energy consumed in destroying the Flaming Dragon earlier. Moreover, he had to immediately retreat to deal with the Dragon God, so he had held back some of his strength. He merely destroyed the magic, and did not cause significant backlash to the mages of the Ice God Tower. With the help of those skilled ice mages, they were able to completely resist it.\n\nEveryone's gaze fell on Rong Yue. Rong Yue gave a wry smile and said, \"Our country's losses are too great. In this battle, all our elite warriors perished. Two knight orders, over ten thousand people, including their mounts, all died. Ordinary soldiers also suffered nearly three thousand casualties. A thousand fire mages sustained injuries of varying degrees, reducing our deployed troops' strength by at least two-thirds. I have no confidence in when the mages will be able to fight again, and this is my greatest concern right now. Even my father, Prince Rong, was seriously injured and is definitely unable to fight again.\"\n\nEveryone fell silent. The battle lasted less than an hour. The United Allied Forces of the Radiant Continent had lost over thirty thousand elite warriors, including top-tier experts like the Dragon God. At this moment, Nian Bing also felt down. Yin Dang had just reported the losses of the Blood Lion Sect to him. The Blood Lion Sect's losses were far more severe than Nian Bing had imagined. Of the five hundred Blood Guards, only two hundred remained. Another five hundred elite warriors also died. The warriors of the Blood Lion Sect had a characteristic: there were only the dead, no wounded. In battle, they exerted even their last ounce of strength to eliminate enemies.\n\nTwo thousand elite soldiers. What did these two thousand elite soldiers represent? If divided by rank, Nian Bing's losses were no less than those of the Hua Rong Empire. How much effort did the Blood Lion Sect invest in cultivating just those five hundred Blood Guards? In just this one war, three hundred of them were gone, and out of the total two thousand elite soldiers, only twelve hundred remained, with their strength at least halved. Such losses were something Nian Bing had never dared to imagine before. At the same time, Yin Dang also told him that less than a hundred of the God Slaying Crossbows were still being controlled. He and the seven elders of the sect had discussed it and were currently mobilizing the remaining strong experts to train them, striving to master the firing methods and coordination of the God Slaying Crossbows in a short period. Only with such powerful crossbows could they inflict greater damage on the gods.\n\nThe silence continued. Everyone present didn't know what to say. Such heavy losses were something they could never have imagined before the battle. They held absolute advantages in terms of timing, terrain, and human support. They had even accurately grasped the time of the enemy's arrival, but even so, the final outcome was this. This showed how powerful these gods were.\n\nAfter a long while, Nian Bing was the first to break the silence and said, \"Although our losses are significant, the enemy's losses are equally considerable. Under our planned attacks, their losses are proportionally higher than ours. After all, the gods are all experts, and it is worth our pride to have killed so many god-level experts.\"\n\nIndeed, the fierce blow dealt by the United Allied Forces of the Radiant Continent this time caused tremendous losses to the gods. Although the deceased were all divine servants and demigods, their numbers were greatly reduced. Nearly six thousand gods left their corpses on this land. At the same time, in the attacks by Nian Bing and his companions, four god-level experts perished, and one god-level expert lost their divine abilities due to the destruction of both arms. In terms of total numbers, only two-fifths of the original gods remained, and their overall strength had been weakened somewhat.\n\nEveryone's expressions relaxed a little. They knew that achieving such results was already very good, but the thought of Xi Jie's incomparably formidable strength made them unable to be happy. The opponent's five main gods were still present, and the next attack would likely not be so simple. Although many of them had died, the core strength did not suffer too serious losses. At least, among the opponent's experts, only those few god-level experts were lost, and even the demigod-level gods sustained very minor damage.\n\nLuo Rou said, \"Now, we should start recalculating the strength of both sides. We must adjust in a timely manner. Nian Bing, please divide your experts into two groups for now. The less injured group will be responsible for being ready to respond to attacks at any time, and the severely injured should rest as soon as possible to recover quickly. The two groups will rotate, ready to deal with enemy sneak attacks at any time. As for my side, the army also needs to be redeployed. We cannot concentrate all our troops in one place now. Otherwise, if those main gods decide to attack with all their might, the denser our formation, the greater the damage we will sustain. We still have about 130,000 warriors with full combat capability. If we cooperate well, we may still have a chance. Furthermore, the enemy will sneak attack us, can we not seek opportunities to sneak attack them? Now I have an idea that I want to discuss with you.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Please, go ahead.\" Although the human side suffered heavy losses in this first battle, Luo Rou's command performance on the spot earned everyone's admiration. Her position as an advisor was irreplaceable.\n\nLuo Rou smiled slightly and said, \"I want to send some food and water to those gods.\"\n\n\"What? Are you crazy? Have you forgotten our original plan?\" Nian Bing exclaimed in surprise. Rong Yue, Mu Jing, and Xue Po, representing the other three empires, also frowned. Feeding those gods, were they going to fight them? They all suspected that Luo Rou's brain was a little confused due to the excessive stimulation.\n\nLuo Rou smiled calmly and said, \"There is a reason why I want to do this. First, those gods probably have no supplies right now, which forces them to fight us with all their might, only in this way can they continue to live. From Nian Bing's description of the God Continent, the reason these gods are so powerful is because they have adapted to the environment of the God Continent and gradually formed through the struggle for survival. This makes them greatly cherish their lives. Therefore, in order to survive, once they fight with all their might, the losses they inflict on us will undoubtedly be huge, and their attack times will also be brought forward significantly. This leaves us with not enough time to react. Even if we can withstand their second attack, it will cause immense damage to ourselves. However, if they can have supplies, the situation will be completely different. The main gods and the gods can heal their injuries before attacking, which will give them more confidence. Once they are in battle, with supplies from the rear, they will remember that they still have a retreat and may not fight as desperately. The impact of morale on combat effectiveness is huge. I believe you all understand this, which is why I have this suggestion. Whether to implement it or not, we will decide after discussing it together.\"\n\nAfter listening to Luo Rou's explanation, everyone's excited emotions finally calmed down. What she said was obviously very reasonable. Nian Bing thought for a moment and said, \"According to what you said, not only should we give them food and water, but we also cannot let them know that this food and water was deliberately given to them, right?\"\n\nLuo Rou smiled and nodded, \"Yes, that's what I mean. Actually, this is not too difficult. I think, for those who have always strived for survival, they can be easily exploited in this regard. You don't need to rush to ask me how to do it. First, we need to discuss whether this proposal can be passed.\"\n\nRong Yue nodded first and said, \"After the Prime Minister's explanation, I feel enlightened. I am also a general who commands troops. Indeed, when there are no logistical supplies, it is easy for soldiers to fight with all their might for survival. Fighting means hope, not fighting means death. In such a situation, soldiers often unleash their greatest potential. Therefore, I think this plan is feasible.\"\n\nMu Jing smiled and said, \"Of course, I agree with my sister's suggestion. However, can we put some poison or something in this food and water? Once they eat and drink it, then...\"\n\nLuo Rou shook her head immediately before Mu Jing could finish, \"That is impossible. With the strength of the gods, let alone ordinary poisons, they are very difficult to affect. Even poisons that can truly cause damage, they probably won't eat them so easily. How could people who have struggled for survival for so many years not be careful with their food and drink? Therefore, we cannot manipulate this aspect. Moreover, the method I chose to deliver food and drink to them, if poison is added, we ourselves will probably suffer the same fate.\"\n\nUpon hearing Luo Rou's words, Nian Bing immediately understood what she intended to do. He nodded and said, \"Then, alright, we can only do this. I hope your psychological warfare will be effective. We must also act quickly in the next few days.\" Since Nian Bing agreed, Marshal Xue Po naturally had no objections, and these decisions were unanimously passed. After that, it was the discussion of the subsequent troop deployment and tactics. Nian Bing did not participate in the subsequent discussions. In terms of military matters, he was far inferior to the people present, and he also had his own affairs to attend to.\n\nAfter coming out of the large tent, Nian Bing went directly to a small tent not far away. He stopped at the entrance of the tent and said, \"I am Nian Bing. May I come in?\"\n\nA deep voice sounded from inside the tent, \"It's you! Come in.\"\n\nNian Bing lifted the tent flap and quietly walked in. There were two people inside the tent. One was sitting on the ground nearby, looking at Nian Bing, while the other was in the process of cultivation, with faint green light continuously flashing in front of her and condensing into her body.\n\nThe two people living in this tent were You You and Ping Chao. In the previous battle, You You's undead magic surprised both the enemy and friendly forces, but it genuinely reduced the losses of the United Allied Forces of the Radiant Continent significantly. Otherwise, the casualty figures would not have been just over thirty thousand, and the final damage to the gods would not have been so great.\n\nPing Chao said in a low voice, \"You You is fine, just that her magic power and mental strength have been greatly depleted. As you know, undead magic is inherently a power against nature. She controlled so many undead at once, even though they had only recently died and their souls had not yet dispersed, the consumption for herself was too great. It will probably take a considerable amount of time for her to recover. Don't worry, I'm here to guard her, and she'll be fine. Actually, You You herself really didn't want to use this kind of magic, but as you saw in today's battle, if she hadn't used undead magic at that time, our losses would have been even greater.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"I have no prejudice against undead magic. No matter what kind of ability it is, as long as it is used in the right place, its effect will be good. Although undead magic is filled with evil aura, You You has clear eyes. Therefore, I have always trusted her. You have worked hard during this time. Are the refugees doing alright?\"\n\nUpon hearing Nian Bing's words, Ping Chao's expression improved considerably, and he showed a rare smile. \"Those refugees all say that their current lives are like heaven, after all, they no longer have to worry about food. Although these refugees have lost their memories of civilization, they are very capable of accepting new things. In just a few days, under my and You You's guidance, they have learned some things and basically understood what happened before. Especially those elven archers, they are too smart. With their archery skills, they are ready to go to the battlefield now.\"\n\nAs soon as he heard the word \"elf,\" Nian Bing's face couldn't help but turn red. He still remembered the awkwardness of being asked to mate by that beautiful elf. \"Brother Ping Chao, please tell You You after her cultivation is finished that no matter how the Four Great Empires develop the Lost Continent in the future, these refugees will have a place. I will definitely strive to ask the Four Great Empires to build a city for them separately. Let the dwarf and elf races continue to exist.\"",

    "content": "Ping Chao smiled slightly and said, \"Then thank you. This is the first time I've seen Youyou so serious about something since she was little. She seems to have truly regarded those survivors as her own people. For Youyou's sake, and for the sake of those pitiable fellows, I must truly thank you.\" Although he had not been in contact with Nian Bing for long, Ping Chao understood very well that the young man before him held a pivotal position on the continent of Yangguang. Even the absolute higher echelons of the Four Great Empires held him in great respect. Furthermore, the strength Nian Bing displayed during the battle today had earned his sincere admiration. After all, he alone had killed three divine-level experts from the opposing side. Without him, it would have been impossible to stop their High Gods and divine-level experts. On the side of the allied forces of Yangguang Continent, Nian Bing could be said to be the foremost expert.\n\nAfter leaving the tent where Ping Chao and Youyou resided, Nian Bing returned directly to his temporary tent. Feng Nü and Lan Chen, being girls, and with Nian Bing having deliberately arranged for the Seven Blade Souls to protect them during the battle, had not sustained any injuries. They were now with Long Ling, assisting the mages of the Ice God Tower, along with Bing Ling and Bing Jie, the two sisters, in checking their magical power status and arranging subsequent attacks and defenses. After all, at this moment, only these mages were capable of performing large-scale joint magic. Both Luo Rou and the leaders of the Four Great Empires attached great importance to the strength of these mages.\n\nUpon returning to his tent, Nian Bing could no longer suppress the weakness in his body and collapsed onto the ground. The battle today had exhausted him greatly. The extreme fluctuation of his mental power and the continuous use of his domain had imposed a huge toll on him. Not only was his magical power nearly depleted, but even his inexhaustible mental power was severely consumed. If not for the determination in his heart, he would have already succumbed. In today's battle, he had inadvertently become the spiritual leader of the allied forces of Yangguang Continent. Earlier, even in front of his uncle and Luo Rou, he could not show the slightest sign of fatigue, otherwise, their confidence would have been severely shaken. Although his early departure was to visit Youyou, another reason was to seize the time to recover his mental and magical power.\n\nNian Bing possessed vigorous innate energy, and his body naturally had the ability to recover. However, such recovery was too slow. Only by being in a state of meditation could his depletion be recovered as much as possible. In this critical period, how could he not guarantee his strength? Especially after hearing the dragon god's dying words, Nian Bing realized his shortcomings even more.\n\nThe gods retreated very quickly. As they retreated, they completely disappeared from the sight of the allied forces of Yangguang Continent in a short period. However, they had not gone far. They encamped under a dirt mountain about fifty miles away from the allied forces of Yangguang Continent. The reason for choosing this location was naturally due to the terrain. It was easier to arrange living quarters on the mountain, and from the dirt mountain, they could vaguely see the general movements of the human army from a distance. For these gods, excavating a few caves in such a dirt mountain was no trouble at all.\n\nA day had passed since the start of the first major battle. The gods were still resting in the dirt mountain. Due to the profound impression left by yesterday's battle, the usually arrogant gods had even sent out some demigod-level gods as scouts to patrol the surroundings.\n\nTen thousand years ago, how arduous was the battle between the Divine Continent and the Lost Continent? After a long period, that battle also resulted in a significant decrease in the number of gods. After ten thousand years of recuperation, they had only recovered to around ten thousand people. However, even in that battle, the losses of the gods were gradually weakened by the special warriors of the Lost Continent. Yet, yesterday, in just one hour, more than half of the ten thousand gods had been lost. Such a blow could be said to be unprecedented in history. Let alone the High Gods finding it difficult to accept, even the ordinary gods were shocked. The humans on the continent of Yangguang were not as weak as they had imagined. This realization made the gods uneasy. If it weren't for Xi Jie's powerful performance at that time that deterred the opponent and killed the Dragon God who had defected to the allied forces of Yangguang Continent, the fear in the hearts of these gods would likely have been even greater.\n\nIn the largest cave at the center of the dirt mountain, Xi Jie was looking at the other High Gods with a grim expression. After the divine army retreated here, he immediately began to cultivate. He only woke up just now. At this moment, after hearing the battle report, he was filled with anger. The death of nearly six thousand gods left him with nothing but killing intent in his heart.\n\n\"Tell me, why is this happening? Just a few days after leaving the Divine Continent, our invincible divine army has been more than halved. What does this mean? If I hadn't blocked that large-scale ultimate magic that day, this number would likely have increased even further. Tell me, why does the continent of Yangguang have such a large army waiting for us there? Who can tell me?\" Although Xi Jie's voice did not fluctuate with too much emotion, the High Gods who were familiar with him knew that his anger had risen to its peak.\n\nNext to Xi Jie, a thin High God who looked to be in his forties said, \"It is because we were too confident in our own strength that we suffered such a great loss. With our strength, although those humans were not weak, they would not have caused such a huge loss originally. The reason this situation occurred is twofold: first, we were ambushed and completely passive; second, it was due to the sudden betrayal of the Dragon race. I didn't expect that old fellow Dragon God to choose to betray us at this time. We also underestimated humans; there are more strong individuals among humans than we thought. When fighting them, the domain power displayed by that golden young man was very powerful. It seemed to be a domain of pure energy, or perhaps a domain of the spiritual level, with an extremely terrifying amplification effect. If it weren't for his domain supporting those human experts, the four of us would have killed them all. Moreover, that golden young man should be the expert that Xia Yu mentioned. His physical mental power attacks cannot be faked. I believe he is the biggest obstacle to our domination of this world, and we must destroy him when we have the chance.\"\n\nXi Jie's expression improved slightly. He nodded to the thin High God and said, \"Lu Suo, as the God of Exploration, you possess five acupoints besides Li Zhong and Tian Yan. Your analysis is very accurate. It is indeed that we were too careless. If we had discovered their plan earlier, our losses would surely have been minimized. What is the most reasonable course of action for us after this? Speak your minds.\"\n\nA tall High God standing beside Lu Suo let out a cold snort and said, \"That old fellow Dragon God was killed by the boss. The only ones who truly pose a threat to us on their side are those human experts. As long as we are careful this time and charge forward from the front, I don't believe they can withstand it. With the combined efforts of our five High Gods, who can stop us?\" This person's voice was loud, and he was wearing yellow armor. As he spoke, an arrogant aura emanated from his entire body. His words caused the other two gods, excluding Xi Jie and Lu Suo, the God of Exploration, to nod in agreement. It was clear that they also agreed with this approach. Only by completely crushing the human army from the front could they vent their anger.\n\nXi Jie snorted dismissively and said, \"Kuang Yun, your God of Dominion is indeed full of dominion, but what were you doing during yesterday's battle? Were you sleepwalking? Humans are very intelligent. Don't forget, before becoming gods, we were all humans. If they could repel us the first time, they might be able to do it the second time. If we don't move, we must destroy them completely when we attack again. Therefore, all our actions must be cautious and prudent, lest we fall into the opponent's trap again. What are your opinions?\" His gaze turned to the other two High Gods.\n\nA High God standing at the outermost position frowned and said, \"Boss, although Kuang Yun is a bit rash, judging from the current situation, we don't seem to have any better options. The provisions brought from the Divine Continent have been consumed in the past few days, especially drinking water, which is now very scarce. Originally, our plan was to kill the survivors of the Lost Continent and seize their resources to support us to Yangguang Continent. Once we reached there, all supplies would no longer be a concern. However, we are now being blocked by these humans from Yangguang Continent. We now have two choices: one is to bypass them and reach Yangguang Continent as quickly as possible, and after obtaining supplies, let these humans know our might. The other method is to completely crush the human allied forces in front of us and then plunder their supplies. Their numbers are so large, their supplies must not be a small amount, enough for us to use. The person who reported last time said that there are large bodies of water in the area where the survivors live, so after killing all these humans, we can adjust for a period of time before heading to Yangguang Continent.\"\n\n\"No, how can we take a detour? I can't swallow this insult.\" The God of Dominion, Kuang Yun,'s eyes flashed fiercely, his fighting spirit fluctuating unstably, as if he were about to devour someone. In terms of combat power, among these five High Gods, he was second only to Xi Jie.\n\nXi Jie raised his hand to stop Kuang Yun's fire and said, \"Yes, Noah's words are very reasonable. As the God of Wisdom among our High Gods, his judgment is very accurate. Now we indeed only have these two choices. However, I will not choose the first one. Not only for the dignity of our gods, but also from a practical standpoint. How large the Lost Continent is, frankly, after ten thousand years, I have already forgotten. From here to Yangguang Continent, either we tear open space and cross directly, or we must walk there. Although with our abilities, we can completely achieve the effect of space magic to get there, our subordinates do not have this ability, so naturally, we cannot use this method. Therefore, we can only walk to Yangguang Continent. However, we do not have an accurate judgment of the distance and how long it will take. Once the time is too long, our gods' combat effectiveness will greatly decrease, while those humans have sufficient supplies. If they pursue us from the rear and join forces with the army responsible for guarding the interface of Yangguang Continent, it will not be good for us. If they could intercept us here, then the interface between Yangguang Continent and the Lost Continent must also have preparations. Therefore, we can only choose the first option that Noah mentioned. Only by killing all these humans and plundering their supplies can we safely reach Yangguang Continent. What we need to do now is not only to destroy the opponent but also to minimize our own losses. We now have only over four thousand people, and we cannot afford further losses. Yangguang Continent has four empires, with a population in the tens of millions. Although we are gods, gods also have their limits, so we must maintain sufficient strength.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I agree with the boss's suggestion. Let's do it this way. Let's plan carefully and completely annihilate them. Actually, I was thinking the same thing just now. It seems that the boss and I are truly of the same mind.\" The only High God who had not spoken finally opened his mouth. His hoarse voice immediately caused the other High Gods to show contempt.\n\nThe God of Dominion, Kuang Yun, who was the least able to hide his thoughts, snorted dismissively and said, \"Se'an, should I call you the God of Lust, or should I call you the God of Flattery? If you hadn't been constantly cowering during yesterday's battle, perhaps we would have already killed all those humans.\"\n\nSe'an said angrily, \"Kuang Yun, speak politely. I'm telling the truth. My name is Yin Shen, Yin Shen who likes all kinds of gemstones, not that *** God of Lust. You've been mocking me for ten thousand years, and you're still not satisfied?\"\n\nThe God of Wisdom, Noah, clearly sided with Kuang Yun, and said with a cold laugh, \"Yin Shen? You are clearly the God of Lust. Who on the Divine Continent doesn't know your broad tastes, wishing you wouldn't even let female magical beasts go? Of the female low-level divine servants, there are probably not many who haven't been defiled by you. You have utilized our long lives the most thoroughly. If our divine people were not limited in number, in the past ten thousand years, perhaps millions of women would have fallen victim to you.\"\n\nSe'an looked extremely lewd. If Nian Bing had observed him closely here, he would have definitely noticed that his gaze was very familiar to him, because his gaze was clearly similar to that of Maomao, the pet fox, the same lewdness, and this Yin Shen's gaze had an additional hint of lust.",

    "content": "Se'an, seeing no one helping him, mumbled, \"Forget it. I know you're just jealous that I don't have to say anything, right?\"\n\nNoah ignored him and turned his gaze to Xijie, saying, \"Boss, since you've set the direction for our actions, we must act quickly. Otherwise, without food and water, our God-man combat power will gradually decrease.\"\n\nJust as Xijie nodded, about to say something, a voice from outside the cave suddenly called out, \"Great, great!\" A hurried figure flashed into the cave a few times.\n\nSe'an, who had been holding back his anger, finally found a target to vent on. With a flash of golden light in his hand, a surge of surging battle qi immediately slammed into the approaching person. Fawning and angry, he roared, \"Which bastard dares to barge in so rashly?\"\n\nEnveloped by the golden light, the newcomer immediately cried out in pain. A milky white light emanated from his body, barely resisting the golden light's attack, but he was still heavily thrown against the cave wall.\n\n\"Se'an, stop.\" Xijie stopped the Silver God, who was about to move forward, his eyes revealing a hint of surprise. The person who had arrived was Xia Yu, whom he had demoted to a mere God-level expert. As a former main god, although Xia Yu had been demoted, his strength was still a few points stronger than ordinary God-level experts. If it weren't for the absence of the Imperial Aperture, Se'an would not have been his match.\n\n\"Xia Yu, what's the rush? I seem to have heard you say 'great.' Can our current situation be described as 'great'?\" Although Xijie was displeased with Se'an's sudden attack, he didn't blame Se'an upon seeing it was Xia Yu. After all, if Xia Yu had brought back more reliable information back then, the losses this time might not have been so great. If it weren't for the significant reduction in the number of God-men, Xijie would have already taken his anger out on him.\n\nXia Yu got up from the ground, wiped the blood from his mouth, and cast a venomous glance at Se'an beside him. \"Boss, oh no, Lord Main God, I said 'great' because we've found water and food.\"\n\nXijie's eyes flickered, \"Oh? Where did you find them, and what did you find?\"\n\nXia Yu quickly said, \"Not far below the foot of the mountain. Today, as I was passing by the foot of the mountain, I suddenly felt the sound of an underground water vein. You know, I also have the Cloud Hearing Aperture, and my hearing is absolutely accurate. Then I had a few demigods dig where I found it. As a result, not only did we find drinkable clear water, but there were also very fatty fish in the water. With these fish and clear water, although it's not enough to satisfy the food needs of all our God-men, it greatly alleviates our current situation. That's why I was so excited when I came in just now that I disturbed you.\"\n\nBa Shen laughed heartily, \"Good, Xia Yu, you're doing well. Who said you were the God of Misfortune? I think you should be called the God of Fortune. Damn it, with water and food, those guys from the Yanggu Continent will die even easier. I'm going to get something to eat, I've been wanting to eat something for a long time.\"\n\n\"Stop.\" Xijie stopped Ba Shen Kuangyun and turned his gaze to Xia Yu, saying, \"Have you checked it yourself?\"\n\nXia Yu quickly nodded. \"I checked it carefully. It's definitely drinkable water, and the fish are also very good. Although they're not very big, there are quite a lot of them. How about I catch a few for you to see?\"\n\nXijie waved his hand, \"No need. Kuangyun, you go ahead and check it again carefully. Our God-men are indeed favored by heaven. It seems that unifying this world is the mission given to us by heaven!\"\n\nThe Wise God Noah, standing by, frowned slightly and said, \"A water vein? How can there be a water vein here all of a sudden? Isn't this a bit too coincidental? Could it be a scheme by those humans?\"\n\nSe'an cast a disdainful glance at him and said, \"Are those humans out of their minds? Giving us food, giving us water, and then sticking their heads out for us to chop off? I say, Noah, don't overcomplicate things. This is an opportunity given to us by heaven. Don't forget, we are gods. With the boss here, even heaven has to give us three points. This food and water is heaven's way of pleasing the boss.\"\n\nNoah glared hatefully at Se'an, \"I really want to kill you, you idiot.\"\n\nSe'an retorted fearlessly, \"Come at me if you dare! Am I afraid of you?\" Among the other four main gods besides himself, he only didn't fear the Wise God Noah.\n\n\"Alright, don't argue. Since the situation has changed, our strategy should also change. Noah, send people to observe the movements of the humans from the Yanggu Continent at a closer location. Order our people to rest in place and take action in a few days.\"\n\nNoah said, \"Boss, as the saying goes, 'a courageous spirit flags when it meets with difficulties.' I think we should act sooner. Otherwise, if there are any changes, we might not even have a chance to regret it.\"\n\nXijie said calmly, \"I have my own plans. Although our army is not moving, it doesn't mean our actions have completely stopped. Tonight, the four of you will go on a mission. With your abilities, it won't be difficult to infiltrate the human allied forces. I have a task for you. The task is very simple: kill the young man who attacked with physical mental power that day. While ensuring your own safety and completing the mission, kill as many of their strong fighters as possible. They will ambush, but won't we counter-ambush?\" He naturally didn't fail to realize that the Yanggu Continent allied forces would be prepared for ambushes, but he still issued this order. Se'an, Noah, and the others were all main god-level experts. They all possessed Earth Spirit Apertures, and two of them even had Cloud Hearing Apertures. With the abilities of their apertures, infiltrating the human allied forces would not be difficult. No matter how strong Nian Bing was, it wouldn't be difficult for the four main gods to kill him. At least, that's what Xijie thought.\n\nNoah looked at Xijie and immediately understood the intention of this King of Main Gods. He nodded lightly and retreated. Se'an hesitated and said, \"Boss, I was a bit injured that day. How about letting the other three go today? It won't make a difference without me.\"\n\nXijie gave him a cold look and said, \"Do you want to challenge my authority? Se'an, don't play your little tricks on me. Otherwise, I will make you regret being born into this world. I heard that in the human world's palaces, there are people called eunuchs. If I turn you into a eunuch, I think our female God-men subordinates will be very happy.\"\n\nSe'an's face stiffened. He immediately said righteously, \"Boss, don't worry. I guarantee I will complete the mission tonight. Isn't it just an ordinary human? If I don't kill him, I won't come back to see you.\" Joke, the most precious thing he had in this world was the little worm below. What was the point of living without that?\n\nThe several main gods retreated, leaving only Xijie alone in the cave. His expression changed, and his breathing became noticeably heavier. He naturally understood the principle of striking while the iron is hot, but if he had no other choice, he absolutely would not do so. Except for himself, no one knew how serious his injuries were. Although the battle with the Dragon God seemed calm, only the two of them knew the danger. The Dragon God's own power and his extremely strong dragon body were enough to pose a threat to Xijie, not to mention that he had previously resisted two such powerful magic spells. In the battle with the Dragon God, he had no choice but to go all out. The Dragon God was killed, and his injuries were aggravated by the Dragon Language Magic. He had only recovered about forty percent of his strength so far. If it weren't for his three ultimate-realm Imperial Apertures, he would have perished with the Dragon God long ago. It would take at least fifteen days to recover to his optimal state. He was somewhat wary of those human magicians. Moreover, through observation of the human army, it was very clear that the human allied forces must have been guided by a master. The only way to destroy those magicians in a major battle was to tread over the corpses of all the warriors and the opposing powerhouses.\n\nHowever, Xijie absolutely could not let the other main gods know how severely he was injured. Although they all knew he was injured, if they knew how badly Xijie was injured, the position of King of Main Gods would likely change hands. Ba Shen Kuangyun had been coveting the position of King of Main Gods for a long time. He was not as rough as he appeared on the surface, and Xijie understood this deeply.\n\nAs night fell, after tonight, the first battle would have ended for two days. Nian Bing stood at the entrance of his tent, breathing in the slightly cool air, thinking to himself, \"I wonder if those God-men have found the water vein.\" The water vein was not naturally formed. With the Dark Demon Rats, it was not difficult to dig a tunnel and then divert the lake water from their side to form the water vein. As for the fish, it was even simpler. Why have the remnants of the Lost Continent survived all this time? It was these fish that enabled them to survive. These fish in the lake water were their only food. When the lake water was heated by the magicians, Luo Rou discovered that there were many such fish here. Now that the remnants had food brought by the Yanggu Continent allied forces, they no longer needed to eat fish. To them, ordinary coarse grains were more delicious than the fish they had eaten since childhood.\n\nAs night gradually descended, the moonlight was as gentle as water. Nian Bing smiled and looked up at the sky. Luo Rou's overall plan had begun. The greatest advantage of the human army was supply and numbers, but was this advantage really that significant now? Nian Bing's strength had fully recovered. The characteristics of his apertures gave him a much faster recovery ability than ordinary people. However, he was now very worried. The thought of the power Xijie displayed that day made him feel chilled. He knew that if he used physical mental power to attack Xijie directly, his chances of success would be at most thirty percent. Xijie must have already known his abilities. With preparation, he, who possessed three Imperial Apertures, would surely be able to hide his mental power very, very deeply. To reach his level of strength, unwavering resolve was undoubtedly a must.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Nian Bing returned to his tent to cultivate. Although it could only be last-minute cramming now, as long as the war had not officially begun, he could only do so. Today, the ones responsible for night patrol were the sisters Feng Nu and Lan Chen.\n\nMaomao peeked around the camp. Having grown up in a valley of white people since she was little, she was very interested in the formation of armies. That day, she had made a great contribution. Her pets, under the powerful amplification ability of the Fox, had killed countless divine servants, not fewer than the Dragon race. After all, among Maomao's pets were several great magical beasts from the Divine Continent. Although the death of the Nine-Clawed Poison Spider had saddened her for a while, she had not raised it since childhood. With everyone's comfort, she quickly returned to normal.\n\nMost of the soldiers in the camp had already rested. That great battle not only resulted in a large number of wounded soldiers but also dealt a severe blow to the morale of these human soldiers. After witnessing the duel of true powerhouses, they realized how insignificant they were. Their fighting spirit needed rest to recover. Only teams of patrolling soldiers moved back and forth between the camps, vigilant against every slight change.\n\nMaomao had run out because she couldn't sleep alone in her tent. Looking at the moonlight in the sky, she murmured to herself, \"Dad, Mom, I've killed so many God-men. I wonder if it counts as avenging you. You must bless Maomao and Nian Bing Gege, and kill all those God-men, kill them all. They are simply too hateful. The Dragon God was also killed by them. Brother Jialamandi is still sad now. He's so pitiful, just like Maomao back then.\"\n\nMaomao was a kind little girl. The death of her parents and tribespeople had a great impact on her, and it was from then on that she gradually grew up, no longer the innocent and naive little girl she once was. Although there weren't many outward changes, she had now learned to think.\n\nSuddenly, Maomao's spiritual power fluctuated, and a look of astonishment appeared on her beautiful little face. In terms of spiritual power, Nian Bing was naturally the strongest in the Yanggu Continent allied forces. But besides Nian Bing, it was Maomao. As a summoner, besides her pets, the only way she could attack enemies was with her spiritual power. With the spiritual energy passed down by her parents and her diligent cultivation in recent days, Maomao's spiritual power had made great progress. The sudden spiritual fluctuation startled her, and she immediately extended her spiritual power outwards. To her horror, she discovered four extremely massive energies. These energies were filled with killing intent and clearly did not belong to their own powerhouses. Moreover, among their own side, powerhouses of this level combined would probably only amount to four, and that would include Nian Bing's Black Warrior Emperor.",

    "content": "A sudden premonition startled Maomao, filling her with surprise and a touch of panic. However, she quickly calmed down and remained in place. She could clearly feel the presence of four individuals, their gazes locked onto her. Any slight movement, she feared, would invite their frenzied attack. Therefore, she couldn't move. But as a summoner, a summoner of Master Magician level, Maomao naturally had her own methods. She controlled her mental energy, subtly slipping away. Though there was some distance between her and Nian Bing's residence, her mental fluctuations were enough to reach him. Simultaneously, she sent out a distress signal to her surroundings. This mental fluctuation was extremely subtle, detectable only by powerful experts.\n\nFour faint figures appeared out of nowhere. One concealed itself, while the other three, from three different directions, transformed into phantoms and lunged at Maomao.\n\nThe highest realm of a summoner was to instantly harness the abilities of summoned beasts as one's own. But as three faint lights simultaneously locked onto Maomao's body, at that very instant, the three figures felt the mental lock on them vanish. In that moment of emptiness, they did not hesitate and attacked. Maomao's body shattered, but it was only an illusion that had been destroyed. A giant cockroach appeared on the ground, its innocent eyes gazing at the three Supreme Gods floating around its body. With a flash of light, its body instantly shrunk to the size of a normal cockroach, and it darted between two Supreme Gods, disappearing into a crack in the ground. The sudden change startled the three Supreme Gods. They had infiltrated the Allied Forces of the Yangguang Continent to assassinate Nian Bing. However, the allied camp was vast, and finding Nian Bing's residence was not easy. With Nian Bing's mental power, creating some simulated mental forms for concealment was simple. Therefore, they decided to capture someone to inquire about Nian Bing's whereabouts. Soon, they discovered Maomao wandering in the camp. Maomao's pet army had left a deep impression on them. In terms of damage inflicted upon ordinary divine beings, Maomao's pets were comparable to the Dragon Clan. Under the special abilities of the Fox, each of her pets was more terrifying than the last. Only the Nine-Clawed Poison Spider died after losing a leg; all other pets retreated with great achievements. Thus, as soon as the Four Supreme Gods saw her, they immediately felt their luck was good. With Maomao's strength, she was clearly a core member of the Allied Forces and would naturally know Nian Bing's whereabouts. Even if they couldn't find Nian Bing, killing such a powerful expert who could threaten them would be worthwhile. Therefore, they dispatched Ba Shen Kuang Yun to guard aside, while the other three focused their efforts on capturing Maomao. In their minds, no matter how strong Maomao was, she couldn't escape from three Supreme Gods. However, they forgot that Maomao was not only a summoner but also a mental magician. With the simulation of her body's form and aura through her mental energy, the moment she detected them, Maomao had already summoned the cockroach Qiang Qiang.\n\nWith a flash of light, Maomao reappeared dozens of feet away. As Qiang Qiang's illusion vanished, her own true form, which had been secretly escaping, was revealed. In the moment of the Supreme Gods' astonishment, silver light flashed around Maomao's body. The Milky Golden Bull, Dan Dan; the Chrysanthemum Pig, Guan Guan; and the Dark Demon Rat, Tian Tian, and her offspring appeared almost simultaneously. Within the suddenly bright golden light, Maomao's body rose, and the golden light revealed its true form: the Nine-tailed Dragon, Xiao Jieba. The previously empty area of the camp was now completely filled. Before the three Supreme Gods could react, the four magical beasts lunged at them. Simultaneously, two clear phoenix cries echoed.\n\n\"Damn it!\" Silver God Se An cursed in frustration. The three Supreme Gods simultaneously unleashed a punch, and the four charging magical beasts were sent flying backward with even greater speed, crashing into the surrounding tents. Immediately, screams erupted everywhere. The Allied Forces of the Yangguang Continent were abruptly awakened by the clear phoenix cries, and a large number of troops emerged from their respective camps.\n\nRed and blue light figures appeared as the three Supreme Gods charged towards Maomao. The distinct auras of ice and fire instantly permeated the air. Seeing the golden light emanating from the three Supreme Gods, Phoenix Girl and Lan Chen's first reaction was to protect Maomao. Their bodies instantly entered the Eighth Transformation of the Phoenix, and their massive phoenix forms, bathed in brilliant red and blue light, met the oncoming attacks of the three Supreme Gods.\n\nA seven-colored light figure then illuminated the side of the camp. Upon suddenly receiving Maomao's distress signal, Nian Bing immediately awoke from his cultivation and rushed towards the location at his fastest speed. Seven blade souls emerged out of thin air, appearing only slightly later than Phoenix Girl and Lan Chen, and charged towards the three Supreme Gods from behind. Nian Bing, relying on instant teleportation magic, followed closely behind the seven blade souls. However, just as the seven blade souls flashed past, a tall, dark silhouette intercepted him. A massive fist was aimed directly at Nian Bing's chest. Under the locked-on aura, a giant golden beam of light, half a zhang in diameter, enveloped Nian Bing's body. Ba Shen's hidden objective was to wait for Nian Bing, who had come to render aid. He deliberately did not intercept the seven blade souls, and only attacked Nian Bing when he appeared.\n\n\"Kill these two phoenixes first!\" roared Sage God Noah. Disregarding the approaching blade souls from behind, the bodies of the three Supreme Gods instantly became ethereal. With the effect of the Earth Spiritual Aperture, they met the Phoenix Girl and Lan Chen with even greater speed. The Supreme Realm's Imperial Spiritual Aperture instantly erupted, and golden light shot towards the two giant phoenixes. The suffocating surge of energy made the originally agile Ice and Fire Twin Phoenixes seem to be trapped in a quagmire. At this moment, they still had the ability to escape. In their Eighth Transformation of the Phoenix form, they could have easily soared into the sky before the Supreme Gods' attacks arrived. However, they showed no intention of evading, because behind them was Maomao! Although Maomao was protected by the Nine-Gong Dragon Xiao Jieba, facing the attacks of three Supreme Gods, she would only be instantly killed. Phoenix Girl and Lan Chen, sisters with telepathic connection, instantly activated their ice and fire energies to their strongest state. With an unyielding aura, they met the attacks of the two Supreme Gods head-on.\n\nNian Bing's situation was also dire. After being sealed by the ferocious energy erupted from his opponent's Imperial Spiritual Aperture, he couldn't use instant teleportation. Although Nian Bing possessed a superior physique, he was, after all, a magician. In close combat, let alone comparing to Supreme Gods, even any Martial Saint could make him look pathetic. At this critical juncture, Nian Bing's rich combat experience played a decisive role. As the golden light appeared, his charging body instantly retreated half a step backward. Following that, a golden light erupted from his brow, and his hands, each glowing with red and blue light, converged before him.\n\nNian Bing also possessed the Supreme Imperial Spiritual Aperture, but he had never used it in the form of energy attack. At this moment, facing the opponent's Imperial Spiritual Aperture attack, the Heavenly Eye Domain was too late to take effect. Therefore, he chose the most direct method. With the assistance of his mental energy, Nian Bing's Imperial Spiritual Aperture pierced into Ba Shen's attack like a sharp needle. The moment the two Imperial Spiritual Aperture energies collided in mid-air, they immediately erupted with golden light. Nian Bing's attack was, after all, a hasty one. Moreover, the Imperial Spiritual Aperture appearing in the same location as the Heavenly Eye Aperture, while greatly assisting and amplifying the Heavenly Eye Aperture, had less offensive power than Ba Shen Kuang Yun's Supreme Imperial Spiritual Aperture, cultivated for countless years in his right fist. Furthermore, Ba Shen was poised for this attack, and the golden light that shot from his right fist only paused briefly before engulfing the attack from Nian Bing's brow. However, this slight pause gave Nian Bing an opportunity. A giant ice prism appeared obliquely before him. Although the massive mirror surface, mixed with red and blue light, shattered under the impact of Ba Shen's golden light, it also reflected his Imperial Spiritual Aperture attack into the sky, illuminating the entire camp.\n\nHaving dealt with Ba Shen's surprise attack, Nian Bing felt no sense of excitement. He cried out in dismay, \"Quick, dodge!\" His gaze happened to fall upon Noah and the other two Supreme Gods, whose illusory figures had rushed towards the Phoenix Girl sisters. His heart sank to the bottom. He was all too familiar with the strength of the Supreme Gods. Facing them head-on without any assistance, the outcome was predictable. Although the blade souls were fast, they were still about ten zhang away from the three Supreme Gods. While they would arrive in the next instant, in that short period, it was enough for experts of the Supreme God realm to accomplish many things.\n\nAs Ba Shen Kuang Yun attacked Nian Bing, he felt immensely pleased. In his view, Nian Bing's strongest abilities were those seven blade souls and his supportive magical domain. Ordinary magic, to his level of battle qi, posed no obstruction whatsoever. Even when he saw Nian Bing's Imperial Spiritual Aperture attack, he did not take Nian Bing seriously. A young man, no matter how strong or talented, could not possibly compare to his tens of thousands of years of cultivation. However, although his attack reached Nian Bing, it was cleverly resolved by Nian Bing. At this moment, it wasn't that Kuang Yun didn't want to continue attacking, but he was temporarily unable to. Nian Bing's Imperial Spiritual Aperture was indeed inferior to his, but his mental energy was superior. When facing Kuang Yun's Imperial Spiritual Aperture energy, the golden light from Nian Bing's brow not only contained the energy of the Imperial Spiritual Aperture but also his own incredibly powerful mental energy. As the two Imperial Spiritual Aperture energies collided, his mental energy pierced through, accurately entering Kuang Yun's body. Although this was not enough to be fatal, the needle-like stinging pain that suddenly appeared in his brain, and the dizziness caused by the violent oscillation of his mental energy, caused Kuang Yun's body to momentarily freeze. Simultaneously, he recalled the divine-level experts who had died from Nian Bing's solidified mental attacks. He hurriedly stabilized his mental energy and watched Nian Bing cautiously, preventing him from launching further mental attacks.\n\nNian Bing's body had actually suffered a great shock as well. Mental attacks were inherently destructive, harming the enemy while also injuring oneself. Ba Shen Kuang Yun, as a divine being second only to the Xi Realm Supreme Gods, possessed extremely stable mental energy. Although Nian Bing's attack had caused him some damage, Nian Bing himself had also sustained severe injuries. Moreover, although he had reflected the Imperial Spiritual Aperture attack earlier, the opponent's sudden full-force sneak attack had injured Nian Bing's meridians. While he shouted hoarsely for Phoenix Girl and Lan Chen to dodge, he could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood.\n\nIf the God of Time among the True Gods were present, perhaps he would have possessed the ability to freeze time instantly. However, there was no such time-controlling expert here, so what was bound to happen eventually did. The moment Phoenix Girl and Dragon Spirit's fully unleashed phoenix flames collided with the attacks of the three Supreme Gods, they clearly realized the difference between the full amplification of the Heavenly Eye Domain and the absence of it. The gap between Tier 13 and Tier 14 was already immense, let alone the attacks of three Tier 14 experts against two Tier 13 phoenixes. The outcome could only be one: instant death. Sage God Noah, without hesitation and willing to endure the subsequent attacks of the seven blade souls, launched a full-force strike against the Ice and Fire Twin Phoenixes with the objective of achieving this instant kill. Although the blade souls could harm them, they absolutely could not kill them. If the Ice and Fire Twin Phoenixes could be killed, the strength of the Allied Forces of the Yangguang Continent would be greatly reduced. Moreover, behind the Ice and Fire Twin Phoenixes was the allied forces' only summoner. As long as these three women could be eliminated, even if the mission to kill Nian Bing failed this time, their task would be considered a perfect success.\n\nSeeing the two sisters who doted on her bravely face the enemy, and with the uncertain fate of the four pets she had sent out earlier, Maomao, at the critical moment, launched a mental attack on the three Supreme Gods without hesitation. As a mental magician, she instantly dispersed her mental energy, solely for the purpose of giving Phoenix Girl and Lan Chen a chance to escape. Even knowing what consequences her sisters leaving would bring to her, she was determined to do so. As Nian Bing shouted, she simultaneously launched her mental attack and cried out urgently.\n\nHowever, Phoenix Girl and Lan Chen had made up their minds the moment they saw the three Supreme Gods. They had both seen the appearance of the seven blade souls and had also seen Xu Lu's short, stout body rushing towards them at the fastest speed. The magic of the Ice Jade and Ice Spirit sisters was also being prepared. As long as they could withstand this wave of attacks from the three Supreme Gods, Maomao would be safe. In the hearts of Phoenix Girl and Lan Chen, Maomao had always been their most beloved little sister. Her innocence and purity had endeared her to everyone. Furthermore, she was the last of the Bai people. If she died like this, the Bai people would truly disappear from this continent forever. How could they bear to see their beloved little sister die like this? They heard Nian Bing's call, and they also heard Maomao's tearful cries, but they still met the attacks of the Supreme Gods. The moment before they were about to collide with the intense golden light, the light in the eyes of the two women fell upon Nian Bing. There was no sadness, only deep longing.",

    "content": "Cat's mental magic attack was not weak, but with her mental magic split into three streams and facing three main gods, its effect was merely to cause Noah and the other two to pause their attacks slightly. However, the golden light still devoured all the blue and red light, and also devoured the two peerless figures.\n\nSeeing his two wives disappear, Nian Bing's heart skipped a beat. Even with his vast life force and recovery magic that could bring the dead back to life, he couldn't resurrect his wives who had turned to dust. Immense sorrow surged through every cell of his body. Nian Bing's eyes instantly turned blood red, and without any reservation, his mental power surged out. His solidified mental power attack, regardless of who he faced, shot out from his Tian Yan acupoint without holding back. The lightning-like beam gave Ba Shen Kuang Yun no chance to dodge; he could only grit his teeth and endure the attack as he launched his own. Identical golden lights appeared on both of them, with Kuang Yun's own attack gold and the gold shot by the opponent. This was a bizarre and tragic battle. Nian Bing's attack was purely mental, completely disregarding Ba Shen Kuang Yun's Huang Ji acupoint energy. His solidified mental power attack passed through the opponent's attack and directly entered Kuang Yun's body, while Kuang Yun's full-power attack flew directly towards Nian Bing's undefended physique. In that instant, perhaps due to the intense sorrow in his heart, Nian Bing's protective Fang Jia acupoint, which had just emitted a milky white light, instantly turned golden. At this moment, his acupoints evolved, and not just the Fang Jia acupoint. Simultaneously, the Xi Jing acupoint, closely related to the Fang Jia acupoint, also evolved to its ultimate realm.\n\nIf it were any other time, Nian Bing would have been overjoyed to feel such a significant increase in his strength. But now, his heart was filled only with despairing sorrow. With a deafening roar, his body was sent flying, landing a hundred paces away. The title \"Ba Shen\" was not undeserved. Although the ultimate realm of the Fang Jia acupoint was enough to block many attacks, it couldn't withstand his full-power strike. The solidified golden light, like a giant hammer, smashed through the Fang Jia acupoint's defense and directly impacted Nian Bing's chest. In that instant, the Little Dragon King Oscar within Nian Bing's body wanted to rush out to help Nian Bing withstand this fatal attack countless times, but Nian Bing forcefully suppressed him with his mental power. If Oscar were to withstand Ba Shen's full-power attack, Nian Bing might have survived, but Oscar would have vanished from this world forever. Having already lost two wives, how could Nian Bing lose his partner? It wasn't until the golden light hit him that Nian Bing released Oscar, along with a surge of life force. Oscar's cultivation of the Dragon God Heart Art had been progressing rapidly. While separating from Nian Bing would significantly hinder his ability improvement, it was no longer fatal. Therefore, in this situation, Oscar was released by Nian Bing. He naturally understood that Nian Bing intended to bear the opponent's attack alone, and despair filled his heart as well. Ever since he gained intelligence after birth, he had not been separated from Nian Bing for a single day! To him, Nian Bing was a friend, a brother, and had provided him with fatherly care. Every time Nian Bing cultivated, he deliberately condensed a large amount of innate energy and infused it into his own body. Otherwise, how could his Dragon God Heart Art have made so many leaps in such a short period?\n\nAs Nian Bing's mental power surged into Ba Shen Kuang Yun's body, the latter's body instantly solidified. A stream of golden mist drifted out from his seven orifices, and his gaze became somewhat vacant. His tall body swayed, and he let out a fierce roar. The seven orifices, which were spewing smoke, then erupted with seven streams of blood, staining his imposing face. A surge of blood suddenly shot out from his lower abdomen, and a massive amount of fire-attribute innate energy rushed upwards, crazily pouring into his brain. At this moment, only this large amount of innate energy could resist Nian Bing's mental power.\n\nThe attack Nian Bing launched in despair was truly terrifying. Kuang Yun's mental shackles, which he believed to be firm, were broken one by one. At this point, he had no other choice. To preserve his life, he had to choose to detonate his Xi Jing acupoint and rely on the surging innate energy to withstand this immense pressure. His eyes had now turned blood red, and the surging red light was extremely intimidating. Detonating an acupoint could bring about a temporary surge in one's own strength, and with the power of a main god, detonating an acupoint was extremely terrifying. Despite this, with the aid of the innate energy from the detonated acupoint, Kuang Yun's mental power was still retreating steadily. For the first time, he felt fear, and this feeling was so real at this moment. Kuang Yun panicked. He clearly felt that the mental power that had infiltrated his brain was incredibly condensed and carried the unique dominance of the Huang Ji acupoint. Blood dripped continuously from his seven orifices. The thick red crystal necklace he wore around his neck instantly shattered, and red airflow was drawn into his body from the outside. He also possessed a divine artifact, which was this Fire Crystal Chain that amplified fire-attribute innate energy. Although he rarely used his fire-attribute combat energy after gaining the Huang Ji acupoint, this divine artifact-level necklace had finally saved his life at this moment. With the assistance of the necklace and the innate energy generated by the detonated acupoint, his mental power was fully engaged in a struggle with Nian Bing's mental power. Seeing the small figure rapidly pouncing towards him, even the arrogant Ba Shen had to retreat. After all, preserving his own life was the most sensible choice. The Di Ling acupoint was indeed a good choice for escape. Within that faint illusion, Ba Shen Kuang Yun fully embodied the tradition of a god-being. Severely wounded, he completely disregarded the other three, turned his head, and fled, causing the axe thrown by Xu Lu to miss. Xu Lu did not pursue him; instead, he spun around and lunged in another direction, heading straight for the other three main gods.\n\nThe moment Nian Bing was blasted away by the intense golden light, when his Fang Jia acupoint, which had just performed its ultimate defensive function, was broken, he himself thought he would follow Feng Nu and Lan Chen to their demise. At that moment, he no longer felt any sorrow or anger; everything seemed to have become unimportant. Perhaps following the women he loved most was the happiest thing. However, just as his body was about to disappear under Kuang Yun's Huang Ji acupoint attack, at his chest, the two orbs of light, one black and one white, within the Li Zhong acupoint suddenly began to spin violently. A vigorous life aura instantly protected his body, and a black light filled with deathly stillness emerged from nowhere, transforming into an impregnable shield. It rigidly blocked the golden light of the Huang Ji acupoint. The life aura nourished his body, and the death aura resisted the external attack. Nian Bing's heart suddenly entered a state of emptiness. His magic power circulated rapidly within his body. Although he couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of blood, after crashing through a tent, his body finally stopped. Although he suffered some minor internal injuries, the damage to himself was not severe. Only the mental power backlash caused his brain to experience a dizzying sensation.\n\nThe Life Orb and Death Orb protected Nian Bing's body at the most critical moment. Lying on the ground, Nian Bing felt a sense of confusion. He didn't even know whether this outcome was good or bad for him.\n\nThe seven Blade Souls were not idle. When Feng Nu and Lan Chen were reduced to ashes under the fierce attacks of the three main gods, they had already appeared behind the three main gods. Feng Nu and Lan Chen were, after all, eight-transformation phoenixes. In their dying blow, they unleashed their strongest potential. Although the three main gods destroyed them, under the combined backlash of ice and fire, their bodies vibrated simultaneously, and their forward momentum instantly slowed down. The seven Blade Souls shared Nian Bing's thoughts; Nian Bing's pain was their pain. Their unreserved attacks, starting with Hei Wu Huang, saw seven beams of light of completely different colors strike the bodies of the three main gods. The halos circulated. The powerful defense of the Fang Jia acupoint saved the lives of the three main gods. If they hadn't possessed the strong defensive capabilities of the Fang Jia acupoint, they wouldn't have exposed their backs to the seven Blade Souls. Three mouthfuls of blood spurted out simultaneously. The three main gods actually used the momentum generated by the seven Blade Souls' frenzied attacks to charge directly towards Cat. They clearly felt what was happening to Ba Shen Kuang Yun. Their objective was simple: as long as they killed Cat, they could retreat with their lives intact. Although Kuang Yun's injuries were severe, they were not fatal. Kuang Yun was, after all, not comparable to Xia Yu. Detonating a Xi Jing acupoint would significantly reduce his overall abilities, but he could still maintain the strength of a main god, albeit demoted from the second main god to the weakest main god. As long as the three of them could destroy Cat, they could significantly reduce the strength of the human allied forces' powerful individuals, and their purpose of coming here for a sneak attack would be achieved.\n\nAfter all, the Blade Souls were not human. Although they could think, in their rage brought about by Nian Bing, when they saw the three main gods with blood light erupting from their backs and charging towards Cat, it was already too late to stop them. Golden light appeared again, and this time, the target of the golden light was Cat and Xiao Jie Ba. At this moment, Cat had calmed down. The deaths of Feng Nu and Lan Chen, and Nian Bing's despairing gaze, had caused a drastic change in the young girl's mindset. Seeing the three main gods pouncing towards her, Cat's eyes turned completely silver. She did not summon her magic beasts again. To her, every summoned beast had its own life. Since they could not resist the opponent's attack, why should they lose their lives in vain? Cat's heart had always been soft, but now, her heart ached intensely as if being gnawed by a poisonous snake. The reluctant gazes Feng Nu and Lan Chen cast towards Nian Bing as they departed had deeply shaken her pure heart. She had not intended to live any longer, because she simply didn't know how to face her Nian Bing brother. If it weren't for her, how could sisters Feng Nu and Lan Chen have died? A faint silver light condensed in Cat's eyes. Those distant, deathly silent eyes, at this moment, emitted tangible light. In despair and endless sorrow, Cat's mental magic finally broke through again, making her, after Nian Bing, another person with a solidified mental power attack. This time, she chose only one target: the God of Wisdom, Noah. The silver light in her eyes gathered at a foot in front of her and suddenly shot towards Noah. Since she was going to die, she might as well take someone down with her. Cat's only thought now was to avenge her two sisters as she died.\n\nSeeing the silver light, Noah was greatly alarmed. Under the guidance of mental power, he clearly felt that Cat's target was him. Without any hesitation, he immediately solidified his mental power. He didn't know how Cat's mental power compared to Nian Bing's, but the scene of the gods being decapitated by a solidified mental power attack was deeply etched in his mind. He absolutely did not want to become another victim of a solidified mental power attack. To deal with Nian Bing's solidified mental power attack, he had made some preparations before coming for the sneak attack. While maintaining his forward momentum, he quickly took out a milky white bead from his chest. A milky white light immediately enveloped his head, and the silver light shot from Cat's eyes arrived at this moment.\n\nThis milky white bead was one of the most precious ores on the Divine Continent, called a God-Protection Crystal. The main gods had different choices regarding these precious ores. Even Xi Jie, the strongest among them, could only choose one and forge it into that ultimate divine blade. As for the God of Wisdom Noah, among the main gods, he was the only one whose mental power could rival Xi Jie. In order to achieve equal strength with Xi Jie in the future, he had been diligently cultivating his mental power, hoping to reach the level of solidified mental power attack. Therefore, he chose the God-Protection Crystal, a special gem that could store mental power. The milky white bead in his hand was the purest God-Protection Crystal, refined countless times, and it contained his accumulated mental power. At this moment, the external mental power combined with his own mental power forcefully resisted Cat's attack. Although Noah still felt a wave of weakness in his brain during the mental attack, he had ultimately succeeded.",

    "content": "Cat Cat was right before her eyes. Amidst a shimmering golden light, the massive Nine Ge Dragon was withdrawn by her. She closed her eyes, and two crystal tears rolled down from the corners of her eyes. She wasn't sad because she was about to die, but because she was unwilling to die without killing a single main god. These were tears of unwillingness, and also tears of despair. She knew that her fate could no longer be changed. Whether it was the seven blade spirits chasing after the gods like lightning, or the Xie Lu flying from another direction, neither could arrive before the three main gods attacked her. Since everything was already destined, she could only endure.\n\nIn Cat Cat's heart, death was not a terrifying thing. She had always believed that death was merely a passage from one world to another. In that other world, she would be able to see her two elder sisters who died for her again, as well as her parents and clansmen. Although Brother Nian Bing wouldn't be there, she would be content.\n\nJust as Cat Cat was preparing to calmly accept her fate of death, a sudden voice made her open her eyes again. The eyes that reopened were filled with surprise. This was because the voice she heard was the clear cry of a phoenix. The sound was so familiar. Although it sounded like one, she could clearly distinguish two different feelings within this one sound: one was ice, and the other was fire.\n\nThe camp on the Yang Guang Continent was no longer shrouded in darkness, because the darkness had been dispelled. Blue and red light illuminated every corner of the camp, like two alternative suns, casting a light that shone upon the earth. That was flames. Red and blue flames, appearing precisely in front of Cat Cat. The flames burned intensely, the massive fire rising nearly a hundred zhang into the air. However, there was no change in temperature, no heat, and no coldness. But the surging energy fluctuations caused the advancing bodies of the three main gods to stop abruptly. Hearing the clear phoenix cries from the two balls of flame, their hearts were filled with shock. They had no time to hesitate; they made their decisions almost simultaneously and turned back sharply. Their abilities converged, repelling the seven pursuing blade spirits. The strange phenomenon before them had already made them feel a sense of unease. Now, running away seemed like the best option.\n\nAll of this happened simultaneously. When Nian Bing broke through the tent and barely stood firm, he happened to see the three main gods pouncing towards Cat Cat. Just as he was about to use teleportation magic to rescue her, he saw the appearance of these two giant red and blue flames. What did a hundred-zhang flame represent? Why did the flames have no temperature? At this moment, Nian Bing's desperate eyes instantly turned to ecstasy because he thought of four words: Nirvana Rebirth. Nirvana Rebirth, which belonged only to the phoenix tribe. Yes, phoenixes were called immortal birds; how could his wives die so easily? Back then, during the Great War of Divine Heritage, their ancestor, the phoenix, was able to block the attacks of so many main gods precisely by relying on the ability of Nirvana Rebirth! Tears appeared in Nian Bing's eyes once more. However, this time, it was due to excitement.\n\nTwo giant phoenixes in the form of flames appeared out of thin air, each phoenix being a hundred zhang long. They stood upright in the air, spreading their massive wings, flames burning in every part of their bodies, an indescribable feeling emanating from them. The red flames, at first glance, seemed no different from ordinary flames. However, upon closer inspection, it could be found that not only did the red flames produce no temperature, but the fiery red light was also so illusory. Yes, they were not real flames, but soul fires from the depths of the phoenix's soul! Only by burning the soul fire could one achieve Nirvana Rebirth! The blue flames, like the red flames, were also illusory soul fires. It was just that the red fire phoenix radiated a righteous aura, while the blue fire phoenix radiated a surging aura of death. It did not bring an evil aura, but a pure death. Under the shroud of this death aura, everyone could not help but tremble. This was also why the three main gods chose to retreat rather than continue attacking when these two auras appeared simultaneously.\n\nNian Bing's figure appeared in front of the two fire phoenixes, flanking the three main gods from behind. At the same time, the ice spirits, Bing Ling and Bing Jie's magic also arrived, along with the seven blade spirits and Xie Lu, surrounding the three main gods. Although Nian Bing was injured, as soon as he appeared, he immediately activated his Heavenly Eye Domain. Seven-colored light enveloped the battlefield, instantly increasing the attack power of the seven blade spirits and Xie Lu. With the subtle control of his mental power, as the two Ice God Spears cast by Bing Ling and Bing Jie arrived, the ice magic's power instantly reached its maximum with the assistance of the Heavenly Eye Domain. Although the three main gods resisted with all their might, they could only barely protect their bodies from injury. Trying to counterattack through surprise had become impossible. At this moment, Nian Bing and the others' attacks, with their reasonable coordination, had become as strong as an iron bucket. No matter which one they chose to attack, it would provoke a combined attack from all the strong individuals on Nian Bing's side.\n\nThe main gods were undoubtedly long-winded. In such a passive situation, their Tier 14 strength immediately showed its advantage. Although Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye Domain had a great amplification effect, he could not attack again due to his previous battle with Ba Shen Kuang Yun. Therefore, the seven blade spirits, combined with Xie Lu and the two ice-elemental divine descent masters, could only trap these three main gods but could not truly harm them. After all, breaking through the Fang Jia Acupoint at the ultimate realm was not an easy task. Moreover, these three main gods had as many as five acupoints, each of which was now flashing with golden light, dealing with the attacks.\n\nThe two giant phoenixes in the sky began to change. The burning soul fires gradually converged. When the flames converged to a height of about ten zhang, the process of Nirvana Rebirth was finally completed. Two perfect phoenixes appeared in the sky. Compared to their transformation into the eighth stage, their bodies had all increased several times. Each phoenix feather was more slender and crystalline, especially their radiant phoenix eyes, which sparkled like jewels in the night sky. The fire phoenix's mouth opened slightly, and a red flame descended from the sky. The flame looked only as thick as an arm, but when it entered Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye Domain, Nian Bing clearly felt that his Heavenly Eye Domain had no effect on this special flame; it could neither amplify nor weaken it. He suddenly remembered the legends of the phoenix tribe that Feng Yan had told him when they were in the phoenix tribe's territory. The phoenix tribe's strongest ability was the Phoenix True Fire. Could this be the Phoenix True Fire? If that were the case, then Feng Nu and Lan Chen must have reached the ninth transformation of the phoenix! This meant they were already true phoenixes.\n\nThere had always been only one phoenix, but this time there were two.\n\nWhile Nian Bing was contemplating, the flame spewed by the fire phoenix had already descended upon Yin Shen Se An. Se An naturally did not want to be burned by this flame. However, the three main gods were all facing multiple attacks simultaneously, and he was the weakest among them. When the Phoenix True Fire arrived, he happened to be repelled by a full-force axe swing from Xie Lu, amplified by the Heavenly Eye Domain. The berserk Xie Lu already possessed terrifying strength, and with the addition of the Heavenly Eye Domain's effect, he could contend with a main god by himself with his two divine artifacts. In the head-on confrontation with Se An, he immediately repelled Se An, who was precisely enveloped by the Phoenix True Fire. What was the greatest characteristic of the Phoenix True Fire? It was the ability to break through all defensive energy obstacles. Nian Bing's Heavenly Eye Domain could not affect the Phoenix True Fire, and Se An's Fang Jia Acupoint defense naturally could not either. A scorched smell wafted over, and Se An's body instantly turned black. From top to bottom, all his hair turned to ashes. In a critical moment, he quickly raised his hands to block, unleashing a surging Huang Ji Acupoint energy, which barely resisted the true fire spewed by the fire phoenix. However, once one of the three main gods was weakened in attack, they could no longer withstand the strong individuals of the Yang Guang Continent led by Nian Bing. Although the main gods had the speed advantage brought by the Di Ling Acupoint, this advantage became meaningless in front of Nian Bing. After all, under the gaze of the Tian Yan Acupoint, what speed could not be seen? The seven blade spirits were already in sync with Nian Bing. After the Tian Yan Acupoint easily located the main gods' movement directions, the seven blade spirits could often intercept them along their movement paths. At such times, the main gods' bodies would inevitably pause. As long as they paused slightly, the ice magic and Xie Lu's God Extinguishing Axe would descend upon them.\n\nThe ice phoenix's flames were not much slower than the fire phoenix's flames. The blue light was filled with an aura of deathly stillness. Compared to the Phoenix True Fire spewed by the fire phoenix, the blue Phoenix True Fire lacked some brilliance but had more depth. The faint blue light drifted down, directly entering the battle circle, also targeting Yin Shen Se An. However, this time it did not actually land on Se An. The God of Wisdom, Noah, on the side, suddenly shouted, and his body attacked dozens of times with surging combat energy that could change the world, repelling those surrounding them for a moment. At the same time, he pressed his palm towards the sky, blocking the Phoenix True Fire spewed by the ice phoenix. \"Go.\" With the many human experts eyeing them and no reinforcements, retreating was the best option. Among the main gods, he detested Se An immensely, but at this moment, he had to help Se An. The attack power of the two flames had clearly reached Tier 14. If Se An died under their combined attack, then today, all three of them would likely be left here. Therefore, he no longer hesitated to use his abilities, forcing back the surrounding Yang Guang Continent experts, rescuing Se An. Relying on their speed, this was the best chance to escape.\n\nYin Shen Se An had always been the most cunning of the main gods. Seeing Noah suddenly explode, repelling the enemies, and another main god already flying out at full speed, he naturally would not hesitate. He had to admit that Se An was very talented in escaping. His body unfolded, and he instantly chased after the main god in front of him and shot towards the sky.\n\nNoah was so angry! His anger had reached its peak. Although his previous full-power attack had repelled the surrounding people and blocked the ice phoenix's attack, it had also consumed him greatly. In the previous battle, the three main gods had all held back, precisely to have a greater chance of escaping. And as soon as Noah created an opportunity to escape, he had intended for the other two main gods to help cover his retreat, and then all three would escape together. But those two guys ran faster than each other, clearly not intending to help him. As soon as they ran, Noah, not yet recovered from his exhaustion, was a step behind.\n\nBlack light, like a celestial rainbow, with a dazzling arc, chased towards Se An, who was running second. If it were usual times, with Yin Shen Se An's strength, whether it was dodging or blocking, dealing with the attack of the Demon Devouring Blade would be no problem. However, he had just been burned by the fire phoenix's Phoenix True Fire, and the severe pain all over his body greatly affected his judgment. When he felt the dark aura of the Demon Devouring Blade, his body only had time to flash slightly in the air. Blood light burst forth, and the Demon Devouring Blade swept past his body. Se An, with a scream, suddenly accelerated and fled into the distance.\n\nThree of the four main gods had fled. Noah, who was left behind, was no longer so lucky. Just as his heart was filled with anger, flames of two different auras simultaneously ignited in the air. With a sudden turn of his body, they fell sharply. The ice and fire twin phoenixes, trailing beautiful flames in the air, the red and blue light seemed to have completely merged together, the clear phoenix cries echoing through the heavens, carrying a trail of phoenix afterimages. In the distorted space, they formed a cone shape of red and blue light, moving towards the God of Wisdom, Noah.\n\nNoah was somewhat panicked. In this moment of crisis, he had to choose to detonate his acupoint. Surrounded by numerous experts from the Yang Guang Continent coalition, escaping could only be achieved by detonating his acupoint. With a thought, his mental power activated the Huang Ji Acupoint within his body. Just as his acupoint was about to detonate, Noah suddenly saw a faint golden light. It was an illusory light, yet it was filled with the aura of death. He saw the ruthless smile on Nian Bing's face, and his brain trembled as if struck by a giant hammer. The energy he had just gathered instantly dispersed. The Huang Ji Acupoint was just a little bit away from completing the detonation, but this little bit made him unable to see the sun of tomorrow again. When the immense energy of the ice and fire twin phoenixes reached him, it had condensed into a physical form only one zhang long. The light and shadow passed through, carrying infinite unwillingness and resentment. The body of the God of Wisdom, Noah, instantly froze. The red and blue light shadows stopped ten zhang behind him, transforming into human figures, while Noah's body dispersed in a gentle breeze, leaving no trace. Even his mental imprint was burned to ashes in the positive and negative dual-grade flames.",

    "content": "The allied forces of the entire Yangguang continent erupted in cheers. This was the first time they had ever killed a master god-level expert! This achievement tilted the balance of the war.\n\nNian Bing's figure moved, and he arrived before the red and blue figures. He held them tightly in his embrace, feeling their supple, perfect bodies. Only then did he truly believe he hadn't lost the love of his life. Whether the master gods died or not wasn't important. The important thing was that his two beloved women had returned alive. What could be more wonderful than this?\n\nLuo, who was commanding the army, stood far in the distance watching Mu Jing, who had just been rescued from the brink of death, and Mao Mao. They looked at the three embracing figures. There was no jealousy in their eyes, only envy.\n\nFeng Nü and Lan Chen's hearts were still beating violently. Although they didn't regret their recklessness in saving Mao Mao, deep down in their hearts, how could they bear to be separated from Nian Bing? Everything had become so perfect. They weren't dead, and they had successfully killed one of the enemy's master gods. This was enough to change the outcome of the entire war, but it wasn't as wonderful as being in Nian Bing's warm embrace.\n\nWhen Feng Nü and Lan Chen faced the full might of three master gods head-on, they thought they were completely finished. Their twenty years of life had come to an end. They would lose everything they had. Although they were unwilling, at that moment, they had no other choice. The full attack of three level-fourteen master gods was terrifying. With their level-thirteen strength, there was no suspense. Their bodies turned to dust amidst the surge of Imperial Aura energy. But just as they thought their lives were about to end, they were surprised to find that their souls still existed. At that moment, they both heard a beautiful sound. It was the sound of a heartbeat. The heartbeat was not loud, but the sound they both felt had the same rhythm. In that beautiful melody, they suddenly realized their souls had begun to burn. As soon as this happened, Feng Nü and Lan Chen both thought their souls were about to dissipate. But as the invisible flames grew more intense, they were surprised to find that the heartbeat they heard deep within their souls was becoming stronger and stronger. Their souls, in this surging heartbeat and burning soul fire, were becoming stronger and stronger. Their souls, born from being formless, ascended to another realm in the burning flames, inheriting the royal bloodline of the Phoenix tribe.\n\nWhen the red and blue flames appeared out of nowhere, startling the three master gods, Feng Nü and Lan Chen's hearts suddenly became clear. That moving heartbeat was precisely from the Phoenix Heart! They finally understood why, despite their diligent cultivation, they had never been able to comprehend the true meaning of the Phoenix Heart and reach the ninth level of the Phoenix, transforming into true phoenixes. It was because they had never experienced the process that a phoenix must go through: the process of Phoenix Nirvana, rebirth. Only by experiencing Nirvana and rebirth could they truly transform from human form into true phoenixes, achieving the highest abilities of their ancient ancestors, the phoenixes.\n\nThis surprise attack was as sudden as it was quick. From the moment Mao Mao appeared with four master gods to the destruction of Noah, it took no more than the time it takes to eat a meal. The allied forces of the Yangguang continent, who had nearly lost three level-thirteen experts in the surprise attack, completely changed the situation due to the sudden transformation of the two phoenixes. Other than Nian Bing suffering some injuries, the allied forces of the Yangguang continent had no substantial losses. However, the four master gods who came to attack were all dead or severely wounded. Such an outcome was not only unexpected by Nian Bing, but also by Xi Jie, the master god.\n\nWhen the three fleeing master gods returned to the Divine Army, Xi Jie had just emerged from his cultivation. The miserable state of Ba Shen Wang Ju truly frightened him. Wang Ju was the first to return. In desperation, he had detonated his Golden Core. Even so, his mental power was still severely damaged by Nian Bing. In his grief and rage, Nian Bing's mental power unleashed its full force. Although Wang Ju had divine artifacts to protect him and used the detonation of his Golden Core to exchange for a large amount of innate energy to protect his mental sea, Nian Bing's physical mental power attack was too overbearing. Wang Ju barely managed to support himself back to Xi Jie's side before immediately falling into a coma. Xi Jie examined his body. Wang Ju's physical condition wasn't significantly damaged by the excess female energy, but his mental power fluctuations were completely chaotic. Even more terrifying, his soul seemed to have suffered considerable damage. Although the Imperial Aura, Earth Spirit Meridian, and Rage Meridian were still intact, to heal his soul, he had to fall into a deep sleep. Even Xi Jie couldn't say how long he would sleep.\n\nWang Ju's injury made Xi Jie's heart clench. He didn't need to think to know who had done this. He then thought of the other three master gods, and his brow furrowed, his eyes revealing a chilling light. He also wanted to save those three master gods, but he couldn't leave his cultivation cave. Only two days had passed since the first battle began. Xi Jie's own injuries had only recovered less than 50%. Not to mention Ba Shen Wang Ju, even Yin Shen Se An, who was the weakest of the five master gods, was stronger than him now. Although he appeared glorious in battle, how could he not pay a price for killing the Dragon God? The Dragon God's strength might not have been as good as Ba Shen Wang Ju's, but he had the innate advantages of the dragon race. The dragon's body combined with dragon language magic brought considerable trouble to Xi Jie, severely draining his combat reserves. However, this was not the reason for his severe injury. The main reason for Xi Jie's slow recovery was the two magical attacks he had to deal with. The powerful magic cast by thousands of magicians from the Huorong Empire, led by Prince Rong Qin, a Divine Descendant, and several Archmages, had put immense pressure on Xi Jie. After dealing with that large-scale magic, he had no time to recover. He then took on another attack, the Ice Lotus, cast by a hundred ice-elemental magicians from the Ice God Tower. If it were in normal circumstances, a level-fourteen magician would pose no threat to Xi Jie. However, after dealing with these two magical attacks consecutively and then fighting the Dragon God, his incredibly strong body could no longer withstand it. Fire and ice were two extreme elements. Although Xi Jie was the king of master gods, he didn't have Nian Bing's ability to resolve them. When fighting the Dragon God, and then trying to resolve them, these two elemental forces had already formed immense damage within his body. If it weren't for the fact that he felt he was about to be unable to withstand this damage, why would Xi Jie have ordered the divine people to retreat? Upon returning here, he immediately began closed-door cultivation. For these two days, he had been fighting against the ice and fire elements, but fully recovering was not an easy task. It was precisely for this reason that Xi Jie did not join the other four master gods in the surprise attack on the allied forces of the Yangguang continent today. According to his plan, today's four master gods would weaken the enemy's strength to a certain extent, and even kill Qing, who was the spiritual leader of the strong individuals in the allied forces of the Yangguang continent. Once his strength was fully recovered, it would be impossible for the allied forces of the Yangguang continent to stop the divine people's charge. The plan was perfect, but changes were constant. When Xi Jie used his battle qi to stop Wang Ju and seal his damaged acupoints to prevent the innate energy from escaping, the other two master gods also returned. The two of them looked battered, and although better off than Wang Ju, they were not much better. Especially Yin Shen Se An, his lower body was covered in blood, and he was mentally exhausted. Finally, two conscious individuals returned. Xi Jie, with unstable breathing, roared: \"What happened? How did you end up like this? Where is Noah? Where did the people go?\" Se An looked at Xi Jie with a pale face. He felt an urge to cry. He hadn't detonated his Golden Core, and his strength hadn't suffered any significant damage, but the blow Black Wu Huang had dealt him when he left had plunged him into deep pain. Yin Shen, in everyone's eyes, should be called Lust God. But Black Wu Huang's aerial strike, by chance, had severed the part he was most proud of. The physical pain was far less than the mental blow. Se An was inherently a person who couldn't stand loneliness. The reason he could stay in the Divine Continent for so long was partly because of the women among the divine people. But now, he had lost the most fundamental thing a man could have. In his heart, besides deep resentment, there was only endless pain. \"Noah is dead. I am also injured. Those people from the Yangguang continent are too terrifying. Noah was killed by the two phoenixes to cover our escape. If we hadn't run, we probably wouldn't have been able to return.\" The injury to his lower body had been sealed by his battle qi and stopped bleeding, but Se An's heart was bleeding at this moment. Facing Xi Jie's accusation, he suppressed the pain in his heart and simply recounted the battle.\n\nAfter listening to Se An's narration, even the mighty Xi Jie couldn't help but gasp. When they first set foot on the Lost Continent, there were a total of five master gods. If the Dragon God was included then, there were six master god-level experts. But now, the situation had completely changed. With the full awakening of the two phoenixes, the other side had at least five or six experts at level fourteen or above. Their numbers were actually greater than their own. Could this war still continue? Even counting the half-dead Ba Shen Wang Ju, they only had four master gods! Although he was confident that he could at least match the strength of two or three level-fourteen experts on the other side, at this stage of the war, even if the divine people ultimately won, the price they would have to pay would be immense. Xi Jie fell silent. He didn't blame Se An and the others anymore. He told them to go down and rest. Even if he wanted to scold these master gods, he couldn't really do it. After all, the divine people could only rely on them. From entering the Lost Continent until now, everything that had happened was far from what was expected. Not only did they fail to kill those reclusive figures on the Lost Continent, but they also lost a large number of divine people. Thinking of this, Xi Jie's mind began to work rapidly. After a brief period of thought, he had made a decision. Since they had already come to the Lost Continent, they could not retreat before victory. Otherwise, the divine people would likely never have the chance to covet the Yangguang and other continents. After all, the enemy had a larger population. As long as the Divine Continent existed, they would always be vigilant, and might even cultivate more experts and formidable weapons to deal with the Divine Continent. If he led the divine people to retreat, it was very likely that in the near future, these strong individuals from the Yangguang continent would attack the Divine Continent. The war had reached this point, and the strength of both sides had shifted from the divine people's advantage to parity. No one could be sure of the final victory. Since that was the case, as long as their side did not lack water and food, they could only stall for time until he recovered before making further plans. At this time, Xi Jie had another idea, but it required his strength to be fully recovered. The feeling of changing from sorrow to joy was the most wonderful. At the beginning of the war, or more accurately, since arriving at the Lost Continent, Nian Bing had tried to avoid being with his wives. This was because he wanted to set an example for his subordinates in the Blood Lion Cult, not wanting others to see him slackening due to personal romantic matters. For these past few months, even his intimate moments with his wives were done stealthily. In fact, although the allied forces of the Yangguang continent knew that there was a powerful young expert among them, they did not know that those two beautiful phoenixes were his wives.",

    "content": "The name Nian Bing has been spread throughout the army since the first day of the war. Now everyone in the army knows that the strongest person in Yangon is no longer a sacrificial goddess of ice and snow, nor is he a sacrificial prince of the Ice and Snow, but this young man who looks only about twenty years old. They all saw the power of the Lord God, and just today, Nian Bing only rekindled one Lord God and fled again with his own strength. It was with his help that the two phoenixes killed another Lord God. For a while, they might have these three names in the Yangon Greater Army. Some people with interest knew that Nian Bing was a magic genius who won the Five New Magicians Competition that year. However, those ordinary warriors don’t know about his information and experience. Only the absolute level of the four empires know.\n\n\n\nAfter repelling the main god's steal, Nian Bing had no more taboos. After reclaiming Kaka's body, he directly took the bird girl and Blue Chen back to his account. The main god was repelled, and they could not come back. All Nian Bing wanted to do now was with his wife. The roe, cat, ice roe, and ice spirit took the initiative to carry out the mission of patrol by the powerful. The seven dragon kings did not fight the previous battle because the dragon tribe was in another direction of the Yangon Mainland Army. In addition to the fire dragon king Garaman Bangsi, all seven dragon kings also came to the human army at this time. The dark dragon king Katerioss took the lead in inspecting the static of the gods and man. Seeing that the gods and man had no intention of attacking again, the Yangon Mainland Army entered the rest again.\n\n\n\nThere was silence in the tent. Nian Bing looked at Fengniao and Blue Chen, and they were also looking at him, \"I know how scared I am just now? At that moment, I thought I would lose you forever.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing held the two women's hands tightly, and his eyes were already a little red. Although his chest was hurting and his mental power was weakened a lot by the two mental physical attacks, he could no longer see his body. He just wanted to look at the two women he loved deeply, and wanted to blend them with himself. \n\n\n\nThe young girl said in a low voice: \"Bing, you should know. At that time, we didn't have any choice.\n\n\n\nWe can't leave you either! But how can we hurt cats? If you change it, you will definitely do it that way. If we are all just selfish for ourselves, then what is the difference between us and God and man? God is thick and broad. If we hadn't had what we had lived today, we might not have been able to see through the ultimate intention of the Phoenix Nine Changes. At least we are still alive now. This time, the real strength of the gods and man has been greatly strengthened, and our real strength has increased. This battle has become impossible and will soon become possible. Nian Bing, you are injured. Repair the building quickly. You are the leader of our strong men. Your Sky Eye Realm and the Seven Sword Souls are our main force, so you cannot make any mistakes. \"\n\n\n\nBlue Chen leaned his head on Nian Bing's shoulder and said softly, \"My sister said, you have a good rest. We will have a long life to come.Now, there are almost seven of our masters above the 14th level. You, plus me and my sister, as well as the Black Martial Emperor, the Dark Dragon King Kateris, my Master and Big Brother. Although we have just entered the 14th level, we have already occupied the absolute advantage in terms of seven to four, even if that world is stronger. We can at least tie it. ice. You should rest quickly, my sister and I left first. You would take us back like this, but you didn’t call Ling Er, it would be bad for her. \"\n\n\n\nAfter hearing Blue Chen's words, Nian Bing felt a little surprised, yes! Because of a moment of excitement, I only brought Feng Nu and Blue Chen back, and ignored another wife. It is unfair to dragon spirit. Since establishing a relationship with the three daughters, she has had a relationship with both Lan Chen and Feng Nu, and to a certain extent, she has completely neglected Long Ling. Although Long Ling has never said anything, Nian Bing can't help but feel guilty when she wants to come here at this time. \n\n\n\nJust as the monk and Blue Chen got up and prepared to leave, the curtain of the tent suddenly opened, and Long Ling, who was smiling, walked in from outside, holding a large tray in his hand, filled with food. As soon as she saw the girl and Blue Chen, she spoke out loud and smiled and said, \"You scared me to death. If you were to go like this, what would happen to Nian Bing and me!\"\n\n\n\n\"Sheng, I...\" Nian Bing quickly stood up and took the tray in Long Ling's hand.\n\n\n\nLong Ling smiled slightly, raised her hand to cover Nianbing's mouth, and said, \"Okay, don't say anything, I understand. Come on, it's very late now, let's have something to eat first.\"\n\n\n\nFeeling Long Ling's gentleness, whether it is Nian Bing or the Feng Nu and Blue Chen, her heart is filled with warmth. Long Ling has never fought for anything and has always been silently around them. Even if Nian Bing ignores her, she has never been dissatisfied. How precious is this kind of wide breasts appearing on a girl!\n\n\n\nThe soldiers of the Ice Moon Empire patrolling happened to see the scene of Long Ling entering the Nian Bingbao tent. Soldier A said to Soldier B in a low voice: \"Damn, we are really powerful! We were just fighting outside, and we were going to fight again. I admire you, I really admire you.\"\n\n\n\nSoldier Yi said in admiration: \"You know, the two Fenghuang and the Dragon Girl from the Magician Association are both the wives of our Palace Magician. They are the most 1st emperor and the third emperor. Don't you think about it, except for the outstanding heroes like our Palace Magician, who can match the beauty of Fenghuang and the soft girl of our Ice Moon Empire?\"\n\n\n\nSoldier Arc said, \"Forget it, it's useless for us to admire you. If we can have the powerful power of the palace magician, we might even be able to have a beautiful woman throwing her over.\"\n\n\n\nSoldier B glanced at Soldier A and said, \"Well, I have a premonition that I hope you can realize.\"\n\n\n\nSoldier Ar was overjoyed, \"Is that so? It turns out that you can see that I am not a mortal, and those gods are nothing. I think our palace magician is the real god, no matter what.Oh, you said you have a premonition, so when can I become such an outstanding strongman as the Palace Magician? \"\n\n\n\nSoldier B said deeply: \"Soon, very soon.\"\n\n\n\nThe light of the stars began to flash in the soldier's eyes, \"When is it soon, brother, I really have eyesight! You said something specific, but you were still a diviner.\"\n\n\n\nSoldier B gave him a deep look. He said seriously, \"I am not a diviner. I just deduced it based on the facts. Your wishes will definitely be realized.\"\n\n\n\nSoldier Arnolds couldn't believe it again, \"Really? Where can I realize my wishes?\"\n\n\n\nSoldier Yi smiled and said, \"Just after the patrol tonight, as for the real place I want, I can even think of it with my toes.\"\n\n\n\nSoldier A looked at Soldier B in surprise. \"So your toes are so bad, don't sell them, tell me.\"\n\n\n\nSoldier B clicked the head and said, \"It's very simple. In the dream.\"\n\n\n\nSoldier A was slightly stunned for a moment, then, his eyes were filled with fire, and he shouted angrily at Soldier B who was turning around and running, \"Damn it.\" As Soldier B expected, after the patrol that night, Soldier A really realized his wish in his dream, and realized this wish as he did. There are many and many more among the Yangon Mainland Army. After all, it is almost everyone's desire to become an ultimate strongman. \n\n\n\nIn a harmonious atmosphere, the four of them finished this midnight snack. Although the food in the army was definitely not comparable to what Nian Bing did. However, they tasted particularly sweet, and there was no tiny bit left in all the food. After the midnight snack, Long Ling was about to leave with Fengniao and Lan Chen, but was kept by the two daughters. They both gave Nian Bing a strange look and turned away.\n\n\n\nLong Ling looked at the curtains falling from the tent and tent curtains that were falling after the Fengniao and Lan Chen left. She was puzzled that she had guessed something, and her pretty face couldn't help but become hotter and hotter. But a sudden expectation rose in my heart.\n\n\n\nThe two arms must have strongly wrapped around Long Ling's waist. The soft scent carriage was carrying a faint fragrance, and Long Ling's whole body became soft. Subconsciously, he leaned against the wide hug behind his back. Nian Bing lowered his head, leaned against Long Ling's shoulder, and pressed her red little ears and said softly, \"Sheng, you smell so good!\"\n\n\n\nLong Ling murmured, \"Don't. Don't do this, you are injured and need rest and rest.\"\n\n\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"My injuries are not serious, and it does not seem to affect my doing what I should do.\n\n\n\nLing Er, tell me frankly, have you ever had my temper these days? \"\n\n\n\nLong Ling slammed without hesitation and said, \"No, I have never been there. Have you overlooked a lot of things for the monkey and Blue Chen these days? We all understand that you have something to do, nothing is more important than this great war on God. As long as we can fight these gods and people, our future will be very long. I just hope to do something that will help you, and that will be enough.Bing, do you remember when we were sleeping together in Tiancheng, the capital of Huarong Empire? \n\n\n\nThat day you expressed your feelings to us, and it was from that day that I understood that you really love me, and to me, this is enough. The love I have paid has not been reported! I am not as beautiful as Chenchen and Fengniao. I have always been a little worried, but you may love them more in your heart, but you also have a lot of love for me. It is only because of some special reasons that we communicate less. \"\n\n\n\n\"Spirit, you are so good.\" At this time, Nian Bing no longer knew what language to use to praise his gentle and lovely wife. He just wanted to love the woman who had always loved him deeply in the gentlest way. He now felt that his original decision was so correct. This is indeed a girl worthy of his love! Although she is not as beautiful as Fengniao and Blue Chen, she also has a gentle and delicate heart that Fengniao and Blue Chen are incomparable. She is always so sure about her love for herself. Only by caring for her can she report it.\n\n\n\nFeeling the increasing heat on Nian Bing's body, Long Ling's heart seemed to have melted. Her wits became a little trembling due to excitement and some tension. She turned over in Nian Bing's hug. She raised her head and looked at Nian Bing's handsome face, and said in a low voice: \"Nian Bing, love me, Ling is yours, now, let me give you everything about myself.\"\n\n\n\nWith Long Ling's permission, Nian Bing no longer had any taboos. When she finished her last word, Nian Bing lowered her head and kissed her soft and gentle lips deeply.\n\n\n\nAt this time, it was already late at night, and the faint spring was gradually turning in Nianbing's tent. He didn't need to worry about anyone hearing the static inside the tent. A simple magic seal turned this into another world that was separated from the world. His mental power easily blocked Oscar's perception of the outside world. Even the best brother, at this time, no one would hope that there would be a viewer next to him.\n\n\n\nAs soon as Oscar felt that he was separated by Nian Bing's mental power, he couldn't help but think a little reluctantly, \"Every time I let me see the previous episode, I will separate me from me. When I become stronger, I must also pick up a beautiful dragon sister from our dragon clan. I think my handsome and handsome little dragon king must have many dragon sisters like it.\" When he thought of these, his psychology was very balanced.\n\n\n\nNian Bing naturally didn't know what Oscar was thinking. He didn't have the heart to think about other things now. The clothes on the two of them were constantly decreasing. Nian Bing carefully picked up Long Ling, put her on his bed, and cherished the white and perfect trouser and the oil lamp in the tent. When they first got involved with Lan Chen, both of them did not leave too deep memories under the influence of medicine. Nian Bing only remembered that it was an incomparable crazy, and the first time with the girl, because of the girl's initiative, the two of them quickly entered the state. Now facing the dragon spirit is a different feeling.Dragon Spirit is like a shy little rabbit, shaking tightly and strangely in the warm and warm mood of Nian Bing. The slim and pretty beauty made Nian Bing soft and every move became cautious. He kissed Dragon Spirit gently in every inch of white and tender Her skin gently rubbed her moving eyes, and her slightly icy slutty gradually became hot, for fear of bringing Long Ling to harm her, Nian Bing endured her own urge, as gentle as she could, and flirted with his gentle spirit.",

    "content": "Under Nian Bing's not-so-skillful, yet extremely gentle and careful caresses, Long Ling's heart gradually relaxed, her soft moans growing louder, her panting more rapid.\n\nWhen the two finally became one, Nian Bing had intentionally used his innate energy and light magic to protect Long Ling's delicate body. The pain she felt was extremely slight, and the throbbing sensation in her lower body brought her an extraordinary sense of fullness. As **¹ continued to climb, Nian Bing finally couldn't suppress the excitement in his heart, his groans becoming higher, and in the increasingly intense thrusts, they rushed towards the ultimate peak together. Although this was Long Ling's first time, under Nian Bing's deliberate care, her shy heart was completely opened, and everything became so beautiful. Unprecedented pleasure washed over her like waves, taking her to the peak of **¹ again and again. The complete fusion of spirit and desire made her feel that she had completely belonged to the man she loved most, and in this intense pleasure, her heart and Nian Bing grew even closer. Their intimacy lasted from midnight until dawn. Although Nian Bing released his vital essence three times, every time he caressed the lovable delicate skin beneath him, he couldn't stop.\n\nFrom shyness at the beginning to later willing compliance, when the fifth wave's peak arrived, they finally entered that wondrous world together.\n\nTen days later. Continent of Gods.\n\nXi Jie once again knelt respectfully at the entrance of the canyon, waiting quietly, his heart filled with apprehension and anticipation, even his breathing becoming exceptionally cautious.\n\nAfter waiting for an unknown amount of time, a soft, genderless voice echoed from the depths of the canyon, \"Xi Jie, why are you here again? At this time, you shouldn't be appearing before us. Your interruption has forced us to stop our cultivation, and you should know how serious this is.\"\n\nXi Jie said fearfully, \"Respected Lord of Time, I am also forced to come to you for help.\"\n\nThe God of Time expressed surprise, \"What? Have you encountered trouble again? With the remaining remnants of the Lost Continent, can they still pose a threat to you? A dignified one million divine beings, what else in this world, besides us true gods, can threaten you?\"\n\nXi Jie took a deep breath. He really didn't want to face the true gods again. After all, being defeated by the humans of the Brilliant Continent was an absolute disgrace for the divine beings. However, he had no choice but to come. After carefully assessing the strength of their side and the alliance of the Brilliant Continent, the nearly balanced strength comparison was something he had to worry about. The number of divine beings was limited, while the humans on the Brilliant Continent numbered in the tens of millions. If the two sides continued in a war of attrition, it would be extremely disadvantageous for his side. Even if they could eventually eliminate the allied forces of those humans and reach the Brilliant Continent, they would likely not have enough manpower to control the entire continent. Therefore, as soon as his injuries healed, he used his strength to directly cross space back to the Continent of Gods. Previously, the true gods had helped the divine beings destroy the fighting power of the Lost Continent, and even destroyed the entire civilization of the Lost Continent. This time, he also hoped for a similar outcome. As long as the true gods were willing to act, those allied forces of the Brilliant Continent would be nothing more than ants, and the current troubles could be resolved without expending a single divine being.\n\n\"No, respected Lord of Time. It is not the Lost Continent that troubles me, but the Brilliant Continent. The Brilliant Continent is far more powerful than I imagined. The number of strong individuals they possess is almost comparable to our divine beings. Moreover, they ambushed us in the Lost Continent. As soon as we entered the Lost Continent, we encountered their ambush, resulting in heavy losses. The Dragon race has also sided with them, and our original advantage is gone. With the strength of both sides being balanced, they have an absolute numerical advantage, which is very unfavorable to us. That is why I wish to ask the true gods to take action, to let those humble humans understand the punishment for blaspheming the gods.\"\n\nThe God of Time was silent for a moment. \"Xi Jie, you have disappointed us too much. Although I did not witness your battles, the arrogance and selfishness of the divine beings are the biggest reasons for your failure in the battles with the humans of the Brilliant Continent. If you had acted with caution and prudence after arriving at the Lost Continent, how could you have been ambushed by the enemy? The Dragon race has always been at odds with your divine beings, and you should know this very well. The results are your own fault. This time, we will not help you again. You must bear the consequences of your own actions. Whether the divine beings have a future is entirely up to you and has nothing to do with us. We have very important matters to attend to and no time to meddle in your affairs. If you believe it is impossible, you may retreat to the Continent of Gods. At least in the short term, I don't think those humans from the Brilliant Continent have the courage to come to the Continent of Gods. In this environment, very few human warriors can survive.\"\n\n\"But, Lord of Time. Are you three lords just going to watch us lose this war? If we can't win this time, I'm afraid in the future...\" Xi Jie couldn't help but become anxious.\n\nThe God of Time's tone remained unchanged. \"There is no 'but.' I told you, you divine beings must bear the consequences of your own mistakes this time. Alright, you may leave, we need to cultivate.\"\n\nXi Jie wanted to say something more, but he ultimately held back. Among the divine beings, he was most familiar with the three true gods. True gods always meant what they said. Since the God of Time had made it clear that he would not help him, it meant that this was the joint decision of the three true gods. Saying anything more would be useless. This time, it seemed the divine beings could only rely on their own strength.\n\n\"We helped the divine beings deal with the Lost Continent before because it was beneficial to us. However, now these things are no longer important to us. As long as we defeat the God of Emotion, we will leave this world. Whether the Brilliant Continent is controlled by the current countries or by those divine beings, it has nothing to do with us. Perhaps, we will never return to this world in the future.\" As Xi Jie left, three figures slowly emerged from the illusion, and the speaker was the God of Order among the three true gods.\n\nThe God of Destruction snorted coldly. \"These divine beings are merely tools we use. Now they have no value to us, so why should we care if they live or die? Time is extremely precious to us, yet we should help them? If this short delay causes us to not cultivate the strength to deal with the God of Emotion at the necessary time, it would be far too great a loss.\"\n\nThe God of Time sighed. \"In my opinion, the divine beings are in a dire situation. Since the Brilliant Continent dares to confront them, they naturally have the strength to contend with them. I didn't expect that on that peaceful continent, there would be so many powerful individuals, to the point that even Xi Jie had to seek our help. Alright, let's go back. This is the crucial stage of cultivation.\"\n\nThe God of Order smiled. \"Time, I think you are indeed the wisest among the three of us. Our efforts during this period have not been in vain. Our coordination and integration of strength have reached the final step. I also have a premonition that perhaps, in the next few days, we will be able to make another breakthrough. Our Three-in-One combat technique is about to reach the perfect realm of 'man and nature in unity'.\"\n\nThe God of Time also smiled. \"Yes! Even I didn't expect such perfect results so quickly. It seems your mindset has changed a lot. This is the solid foundation we've laid for the final battle between the Father of Technology and the Father of Human Evolution. Destruction is right, we cannot delay even a minute now. We are progressing, and Kao and Tian Xiang, the God of Emotion couple, are also progressing. To truly destroy them, we must exert all our efforts.\"\n\nThe three figures re-entered the illusion, and the atmosphere on the Continent of Gods seemed to become much heavier.\n\nLost Continent, camp of the allied forces of the Brilliant Continent. The entire camp was orderly conducting simple training. Although this training did not have much effect on improving the strength of the warriors of the four great empires of the Brilliant Continent, it could boost morale. This was because during their daily training, Nian Bing and other powerful individuals would observe them. The gaze of the powerful individuals gave these warriors immense confidence.\n\nA few days ago, good news arrived again. Reinforcements from the four great empires had arrived. Due to the real threat that the divine beings might pose to the Brilliant Continent, and the importance of the Lost Continent for the future development of the four great empires, all four countries had dispatched large numbers of elite troops, adding another 200,000 fresh troops to the remaining four allied forces. At the same time, Duke Lan Yu and his wife from the Orland Empire also arrived in a timely manner, bringing the entire elite Silver Feather Knights of the Orland Empire. The Huaron Empire's power was greatly diminished due to the demise of the Flame Lion Knights and the Flame Demon Dragon Knights. Currently, apart from the troops stationed at the border, all the elite forces that the Orland Empire could mobilize were in the Lost Continent. Luo Rou's judgment was very accurate. For the Orland Empire to develop better, it had to achieve two things. First, it had to maintain good relations with the Ice Moon Empire, not only because of the long-standing friendship between the Orland Empire and the Ice Moon Empire, but also because the army from the Ice Moon Empire was led by Nian Bing this time, and the Ice Moon Empire had also established the first freshwater lake on the Lost Continent. Considering all these factors, the Orland Empire had to maintain a partnership with the Ice Moon Empire. Second, it had to play an important role in this war and obtain the much-needed territory on the Lost Continent. The Orland Empire's own territory was mostly hills, mountains, and plateaus, which was why its agriculture lagged far behind. The preciousness of a country had a crucial impact on its strength. Therefore, they needed to strive for more plains in the new land of the Lost Continent. Luo Rou naturally knew that Nian Bing also had an unusual relationship with the Langmu Empire and the Huaron Empire, which was why she had dispatched a large number of artisans to begin the development of the Lost Continent early on. The Heavenly Dang Mountain Range was within the Orland Empire's territory, giving them a significant geographical advantage. Now, together with the Ice Moon Empire, they controlled the important passage from the Brilliant Continent to the Lost Continent, giving them an advantage in the future development of the Lost Continent.\n\nThe Langmu Empire and the Huaron Empire naturally did not want to be outdone. While dispatching troops, they also brought a large number of resources and various tools. Although it was not yet time to carve out their respective territories on the Lost Continent, being prepared in advance was better than scrambling at the last minute. The royal families of the four great empires were not fools; they knew exactly what to do at this critical juncture.\n\nThe thousand mages of the Huaron Empire had basically recovered their combat effectiveness. Even Prince Rong, who had almost lost his life due to his age and injuries, had recovered eighty percent of his strength under Nian Bing's full treatment. However, the demise of the two knight orders had dealt a severe blow to this great marshal of the Brilliant Continent's military, making his original ambition somewhat disheartened. In his conversation with Nian Bing, Prince Rong told Nian Bing that after the war with the Divine Gods ended, he would return to the Huaron Empire to retire and would completely hand over the Rong family to his eldest son, Rong Yue. He also reminded Nian Bing not to forget what he had promised him. Prince Rong didn't know how fortunate he was with his choice. Now, as long as Nian Bing was present, no one on the Brilliant Continent dared to make a move against the Rong family. Even the royal family of the Huaron Empire would absolutely not violate the law to trouble the Rong family. The strength represented by the Rong family itself, coupled with a top-tier expert like Nian Bing, made everyone consider the implications.\n\nThe routine meeting of the four allied armies was held in the morning. Representing the four great empires were Mu Jing and Mu Rong from the Langmu Empire. Mu Rong personally led the supply troops to the front line this time, partly to assist his sister, and another reason was to gain greater merit in the development and expansion of the Lost Continent. This way, the selection of the next emperor of the Langmu Empire would no longer have any variables.\n\nRepresenting the Orland Empire were Luo Rou and Duke Lan Yu. The Ice Moon Empire was still represented by Marshal Xue Po and Nian Bing, while the Huaron Empire was represented by brothers Rong Yue and Rong Tian. Due to the strength Nian Bing had displayed in this war and the forces he controlled, Rong Tian's status rose rapidly due to his father's position. Although he had just returned to the Rong family, his status within the Rong family soared. His son was a top-tier expert, his three daughters-in-law were at least magic masters, and his wife was a priestess of the Ice Goddess Tower. With such a combination of strengths, who would dare to underestimate Rong Tian? In the face of such power, no one in the Rong family dared to speak ill of Rong Tian anymore. He had directly entered the high-level ranks of the Rong family. With his twin brother Rong Yue within the Rong family, in just over ten days, Rong Tian had leaped to become a senior figure in the Rong family, second only to Prince Rong and Rong Yue. Although he did not have many Rong family members under his command, he belonged to his elder brother Rong Yue's faction, and he himself possessed the strength of a magic master, which was already enough.",

    "content": "In the meeting, Rong Yue was the first to speak. After all, the Huaron Empire was the strongest nation on the continent of Yangguang. \"According to the reconnaissance of the Seven Dragon Kings, the gods have still made no move. More than ten days have passed, and the strength we consumed has basically been replenished. In terms of personnel deployment, our strength has even greatly increased. Should we cut off their food and water and launch a proactive attack? It's not that Rong Yue's confidence has soared. After analysis, the conclusion is very simple: in the confrontation of top powerhouses, the Yangguang Continent Allied Forces do not have a disadvantage. Their demigod-level gods can also be compensated by the large number of magicians on the Yangguang Continent side, coupled with the God-Slaying Crossbow and a vast army. Although there may be some losses, there is still a chance to completely annihilate the gods.\n\nAlthough the Yangguang Continent Allied Forces have a continuous supply behind them, more than 300,000 troops have gathered here, and the supply consumption is astonishing. It is clearly not a solution to continue to drag this out.\n\nAs soon as Rong Yue finished speaking, everyone's attention turned to Luo Rou. Luo Rou's wisdom in military command during the War Against the Gods was witnessed by everyone. She had long since become the de facto strategist of the Allied Forces, and all military operations were under her command, including the deployment of various armies. Because of the existence of the powerful threat of the gods, the four-nation Allied Forces were unprecedentedly united.\n\nLuo Rou nodded with a smile and said, \"Perhaps it is time to take action. The reason why the gods have been inactive these past few days is, like us, to recover their strength and redeploy. Another reason is that they now also have supplies of food and water. It's time to cut off their food and water. However, we do not need to take the initiative to attack. We have been deployed at the Allied Forces' encampment for some time. There is no better place to fight the enemy than here. If we attack proactively, we will have to redeploy. Once the gods have any ambushes, our losses will greatly increase. By staying here and threatening to cut off their food and water, the enemy will only have the possibility of attacking us. This way, our God-Slaying Crossbow troops and magician troops can inflict the greatest damage on the enemy.\"\n\nSpeaking of which, Luo Rou's pretty face showed a charming smile again. \"At this point, the gods can only choose from three options. First, they can engage us in a head-on battle. With our current deployment, we have at least a 60% chance of winning in a head-on battle. However, the enemy's strong individuals may escape in the final confrontation. The strength of their main gods and god-level experts is very terrifying. If they insist on fleeing, we can do nothing about it. We can only find ways to kill them in the future. Second, due to the cut-off of food and water, the enemy may disperse their forces and infiltrate towards the continent of Yangguang. This is obviously a last resort for them. We also have heavy troops deployed at the border between the Lost Continent and the continent of Yangguang, centered around Bingyue Lake, where a large number of troops are stationed. If they dare to disperse, our strong individuals can concentrate their superior strength. In the pursuit, we can gradually nibble away at the enemy's strength. With the help of the Dragon Clan, this is entirely achievable. The third situation is that the gods, due to the cut-off of food and water, are forced to retreat to the Continent of Gods. As the saying goes, a defeated army collapses like a mountain. Once they retreat, all their morale will be gone. We just need to pursue them and drive them back to the Continent of Gods. Then the final victory of this war will also belong to us. At that time, we can build a solid defense line on the necessary path between the Lost Continent and the Continent of Gods. The Continent of Gods is just a small place. Since our strong individuals are no weaker than the enemy, as long as we trap them there, we will eventually be able to completely destroy them. The scales of victory have already tilted in our favor. In a sense, we are the righteous side, and victory will surely belong to us. Although the comparison of strength between the two sides is almost balanced, we have many advantages that the enemy does not have. Therefore, in the final war, what we need to focus on is to minimize our own losses and completely resolve the threat of the gods to us.\"\n\nLuo Rou's analysis received the unanimous approval of the high-ranking officials of the four nations. As the meeting concluded, the action to cut off food and water had already begun. The Yangguang Continent Allied Forces also began to move, preparing to face the most crucial war, and perhaps the last war, of the War Against the Gods. After the meeting, Nian Bing was about to look around and assist Luo Rou with some work, but was stopped by Duke Lan Yu. Nian Bing did not dare to neglect his father-in-law. Upon hearing Duke Lan Yu call him, he quickly followed the foremost figure in the Orland Empire's military out of the large tent.\n\n\"Your Grace, do you need me for something?\" Nian Bing asked as he walked behind Duke Lan Yu.\n\nDuke Lan Yu said expressionlessly, \"It's been some days since you came here, and I haven't had a chance to talk to you yet. You're a good kid! You've taken away two of my daughters at once.\"\n\nNian Bing said cautiously, \"Your Grace, this can't be described as taking away. Feng Nu, Chen Chen, and I are truly in love. I will love them for all my life.\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu waved his hand and said, \"You don't need to tell me these things. I've heard them many times. However, whether you can do it depends on your actions in the future.\"\n\nHearing Duke Lan Yu say this, Nian Bing was immediately relieved. Although the Duke's tone was not very good, at least he had acknowledged his relationship with Feng Nu and Lan Chen. \"Your Grace, I will prove it to you with my actions.\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu sighed and said, \"Frankly, in terms of talent, you are almost impeccable. The first time I met you, I was amazed by your talent. At such a young age, you already possessed considerable magical strength and were also a fire and ice dual-attribute magician. At that time, I knew that you were no ordinary person and would eventually shine. It's only been a few years since we first met, but you have undergone tremendous changes. A few years is not short for ordinary people, but for cultivators like us, whether warriors or magicians, it is not long. Perhaps everyone's strength will improve after a few years of hard training, but to reach such a terrifying realm of improvement as you have, it can be considered unprecedented.\"\n\nNian Bing said somewhat sheepishly, \"Perhaps it's because I'm quite lucky. On a few coincidental occasions, I broke through several realms, which led to my current strength.\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu shook his head again. He turned and looked at Nian Bing. At this moment, a smile appeared on his face. \"Opportunities are indeed important, but whether you can seize the opportunities depends on each person's ability. Strength is built on nine parts hard work and one part luck. Luck is what you call opportunity. If grasped well, opportunity can bring about qualitative changes. But without hard training as a foundation, even if opportunities arise, you cannot seize them. Ru Yan has already done an excellent job in this regard. I never thought anyone could surpass her in this aspect, but you have done it. Therefore, in terms of cultivation, you can be considered one of the few people I admire. You don't need to be too humble; I'm speaking from the bottom of my heart.\"\n\nWhile listening to Duke Lan Yu praise him, Nian Bing did not respond, because he always felt that Duke Lan Yu must have something more to say. Otherwise, he wouldn't have called him out specifically.\n\nAs expected, after praising Nian Bing, Duke Lan Yu suddenly changed the subject and said coldly, \"Although your strength is admirable, I detest people like you when it comes to handling relationships. You should know what happened between Ru Yan and me back then. Since Ru Yan, I have not had any abnormal relationship with any other woman. I have always believed that love must be monogamous, and only monogamous love is perfect love. You say you deeply love my two daughters, so if I ask you, which one do you love more, how will you answer me?\n\nCan you answer it?\" When he said this, Duke Lan Yu's voice was not loud, but it clearly carried a hint of anger.\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"I cannot answer.\"\n\nDuke Lan Yu looked at Nian Bing. At this moment, they had already walked out of the camp and arrived by the small lake that originally belonged to the survivors of the Lost Continent. Duke Lan Yu stopped and continued, \"Yes, you cannot answer. A person only has one heart, and only a fixed amount of love. If you give all this love to one woman, that is true love. But what about you now? Your love is divided into three parts. Is that fair to your women? They don't get your complete love. Conversely, if the woman you deeply love also has two other men, can you accept it?\"\n\nNian Bing said with a wry smile, \"I cannot accept it. If such a situation were to happen, I would probably destroy my love rivals at any cost. Your Grace, I understand what you mean, but things have already happened. Frankly, I used to have the same thought as you, wanting to love only one woman in my life. However, sometimes plans don't keep up with changes. Before, I only loved Feng Nu. You should have seen it when you were at your Duke's mansion. But Ling'er also deeply loves me. Her heart is so fragile, and she has always been waiting for me silently. It's hard for me not to develop feelings for her, and I can't abandon her. I have also suffered because of this, but later I figured it out. Although I cannot give all my love to one woman, I will do my best to give all my love to them and try my best to love each of them. I don't fear your anger. Frankly, even if you want me to separate from Feng Nu or Chen Chen now, it's already impossible. I admit that I am far inferior to you in terms of monogamy, but I also love them, and I cannot let any of them leave my side. As their man, I have the obligation to protect them, unless they are willing, no one can take them away from me.\" Every word Nian Bing said was firm. He wasn't explaining himself. These words, which seemed somewhat threatening, must have been harsh to hear, but he spoke his mind.\n\nDuke Lan Yu looked at Nian Bing coldly and said calmly, \"Why don't you explain to me? I know what happened between you and Chen Chen can be said to be an accident.\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"There's nothing to explain. Since things have already happened and the facts are in front of us, explaining is just perfunctory to you. I respect you, so I absolutely don't want to perfunctory you. I'm speaking my mind. Perhaps you will hate me even more, but this is the only answer I can give.\"\n\nThe frost on Duke Lan Yu's face seemed to thaw. He suddenly stepped forward and punched Nian Bing in the chest, making Nian Bing stagger back two steps. This punch contained no fighting energy, only physical strength. Nian Bing had at least a hundred ways to resolve this punch, but he didn't. Duke Lan Yu's punch naturally couldn't cause any harm to his sturdy body, but it stunned him because he saw a mysterious smile on Duke Lan Yu's face.\n\n\"Alright, don't scare him anymore. He's right; the facts are already in front of us. Moreover, does your intimidation have any effect? Your husband and I together probably can't defeat him.\" Amidst laughter, Yu Ru Yan suddenly appeared before Nian Bing and Lan Yu. Because of the previous conversation with Lan Yu, Nian Bing had fallen into thought and had not activated his Heavenly Eye acupoint's probing function, so he had not detected Yu Ru Yan's presence nearby beforehand. Yu Ru Yan walked to Duke Lan Yu, took his arm, and smiled, \"Nian Bing, Lan Yu just wanted to scare you to make you a little more vigilant. So you don't get involved with others everywhere. What we have now, we can reluctantly accept. If you have more wives in the future, let's see if we can forgive you.\"\n\nLan Yu laughed heartily and said, \"Didn't you say that even if we, husband and wife, combined, we're not his match? Even if we can't forgive him, what can we do? Nian Bing, you're honest and confessed, so we'll let you off the hook. However, my daughter Lan Yu cannot follow you without a proper marriage. After this war is over, you must personally go to my Duke's mansion to marry my daughter. Do you understand?\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing was overjoyed and was about to agree when he heard a gentle voice say, \"I understand. Brother-in-law, please don't blame Nian Bing. His mother and I couldn't give him much care since he was young. Don't worry, after the war ends, I will personally visit to propose to your daughter as a show of respect.\" Rong Tian walked over from a distance. With his mental power, hearing their conversation was not an issue. The two handsome middle-aged men exchanged glances and couldn't help but nod. Although the Hua Rong Empire and the Ao Lan Empire had fought many wars, in matters of their children's marriages, these two middle-aged men of similar age had forgotten which country they belonged to.\n\nLan Yu smiled and said, \"Brother Rong, you won't blame me for calling your son out to reprimand him, will you?\"\n\nRong Tian laughed heartily and said, \"How could I? When we weren't around Nian Bing, no one disciplined him. Brother Lan, if you help me discipline him, I'll gladly have some leisure.\"\n\nLan Yu smiled charmingly and said, \"Your son is so outstanding. If I were to truly discipline him, I wouldn't dare. After the war ends, I will return to Ao Lan City to await Brother Rong's proposal. Don't keep me waiting too long.\"\n\nRong Tian quickly said, \"No, no. Ah, actually, Nian Bing is a pitiful child. His mother was forced to leave when he was six, and I was forced to leave his side when he was ten. For so many years, this child has relied on his own resilience to get by. To be honest, I truly feel I've failed as a father! Now that we are reunited, it's time for me to fulfill my fatherly responsibilities. Brother Lan, don't worry, I'm eager for Nian Bing and your daughters to marry soon, so I can enjoy being a grandfather.\"\n\nLan Yu said, \"With Brother Rong's words, I am at ease. I only have these two daughters in my life, and I wouldn't be content if either of them were wronged! Now, it seems all the good fortune has fallen to your son. En, the sooner they get married, the sooner I become a grandfather, which seems not bad. As long as we win this War of Exalted Gods, the continent will enter a new era of peace. The Lost Continent is vast. Even if the four empires eventually have conflicts over this continent, it will be many years from now. On such a vast continent, it would likely take hundreds of years to establish a new civilization. With the four empires investing all their manpower and resources into this continent, who would have the time for war? Don't laugh at me, but I was secretly delighted for several days when your Rong family's two knight legions were wiped out. Now, the continent's situation is increasingly moving towards balance. This is truly what I most wish to see!\"\n\nRong Tian said with a wry smile, \"Brother Lan, please keep your voice down. Please don't let my father hear this, otherwise, he might start a fight with you here.\"\n\nLan Yu sighed lightly and said, \"Putting aside our disputes, Prince Rong is indeed the person I admire most. Only he could cultivate two elite knight legions like the Flame Lions and Flame Dragons. Fortunately, our Ao Lan Empire now has Rou'er. Otherwise, when the Hua Rong Empire's army fields its ace troops again, we would have no way to deal with them.\"\n\nLan Yu and Rong Tian chatted more and more enthusiastically. Yu Ruyan quietly gave Nian Bing a look, and Nian Bing immediately understood. After greeting them, he quickly ran off. Having his father stand up for him was enough. As for Long Ling, he would also marry her with proper ceremony. Although Long Zhi had more influence, he was ultimately striving for his ideals and was also his first magic teacher. Proposing to him was a must, whether for Ling'er or because he was once his disciple, he had to show Long Zhi the necessary respect.\n\nThe strategy of cutting off supplies was only implemented for one day when scouts from the Dragon Clan reported that the gods had begun to move. This time, the gods chose the first of Luo Rou's three judgments: they would assemble and advance towards the Allied Forces of the Guangling Continent in a complete formation from the front. The elderly and young members of the Dragon Clan had arrived at the Allied Forces' encampment on the third day after the first battle, joining the Seven Dragon Kings and the dragon warriors. Currently, the elite among the dragon warriors were responsible for scouting. Fire Dragon King Gala Mandis had recovered eighty percent of his health after this period of rest. With Nian Bing's daily comfort, he had gradually accepted the fact of his father's death. However, the death of the Dragon God had also created immense hatred between the Dragon Clan and the gods. As soon as they received news of the gods' movement, all the dragon warriors, led by the Seven Dragon Kings, ascended into the sky, awaiting the enemy's arrival.\n\nThe Allied Forces of the Guangling Continent formed their ranks sequentially. To counter potential surprise attacks from powerful gods, the Allied Forces were divided into small square formations, with ten thousand men as a unit, neatly spread across the central plain and surrounding hills. The Godslayer Crossbow corps had been reconfigured, and the elites of the Blood Lion Cult were still responsible for wielding these incredibly destructive weapons. After a brief period of training, and with the targeting devices forged by Dwarf King Xilu, these Blood Lion Cult elites quickly mastered the use of the Godslayer Crossbows. Currently, they were positioned at a high point, with all Godslayer Crossbows loaded and ready to fire at any moment. Under the escort of the human army, the mage corps was positioned in the center of all allied forces, personally led by Prince Rong and the new generation Ice and Snow Goddess Priest, Bing Ling. They had already begun preparing their magic. The war was imminent. Now, all they awaited was the arrival of the gods.\n\nThe gods' actions were a last resort. When Xijie learned of the sudden cutoff of supplies, even if he was foolish, he understood that all of this was the work of the Allied Forces of the Guangling Continent. At this point, he knew he had no retreat. For the gods, this was not only an important battle, but possibly their last. Victory meant an unimpeded advance towards the Guangling Continent; defeat meant the demise of the gods.\n\nThis time, Xijie dared not be careless. He flew at the very front of the divine army, fully activating his ultimate cloud-listening ability to scout for potential dangers ahead. However, this time his caution proved useless. The Allied Forces of the Guangling Continent had no further ambush tactics planned; they were simply waiting quietly for the gods' arrival.\n\nAmong the four main gods, besides Xijie, the God of Exploration, Luosuo, still possessed full combat power. Although Silver God Se'an had lost his male capabilities, his strength had not diminished. As for Tyrant God Kuangyun, although he had awakened from his slumber, his mind was still somewhat unclear. His strength had also been greatly reduced due to the disappearance of two of his acupoints. On the gods' side, the only advantage they held was Xijie himself and over a hundred demigod-level experts. Xijie was like the \"Imperial Acupoint\" of the entire divine force; he was the strongest point, and it was precisely because of his existence that the gods still held a balanced situation against the Allied Forces of the Guangling Continent. After all, no one on the Allied Forces of the Guangling Continent was confident they could defeat him.\n\nFrom afar, Xijie could already see the dragons in the sky, and below them, the neat square formations of the Allied Forces of the Guangling Continent. Their numbers were clearly more than double that of the previous time, and their imposing aura clearly indicated they were well-prepared. When the divine army approached within fifteen hundred zhang of the Allied Forces of the Guangling Continent, Xijie gave the order for the gods to stop. The gods arranged themselves in an orderly fashion. At the forefront were the demigod-level experts. The other three main gods, along with over ten god-level divine beings, floated in the air about ten zhang above the center of the divine army. The gods were arranged in a conical formation. The distance of fifteen hundred zhang was precisely the distance at which magic would be somewhat weakened upon arrival. Although magic of the fourteenth tier and above had a very long attack range, it would inevitably be weakened after exceeding a certain distance controlled by the mages. This was one of the drawbacks of large-scale fusion magic. After the gods stopped, Xijie suddenly increased his speed and flew alone towards the Allied Forces of the Guangling Continent.\n\nNian Bing stood at the very front of the Allied Forces of the Guangling Continent. Seeing Xijie flying towards them, he also rose into the air without showing weakness. At his signal, only Phoenix Woman and Lan Chen followed him into the sky.\n\nAs they flew, the two sides quickly approached and stopped almost simultaneously when they were a hundred zhang apart. Nian Bing saw that Xijie today had clearly recovered his full combat power. Although he was not activating his fighting spirit, a faint golden light emanated from him. Truly the strongest of the gods, his invisible aura already put him under considerable pressure. He was sizing up Xijie, and Xijie was also sizing him up. In Xijie's eyes, Nian Bing, wearing a golden magic robe and tall and handsome, appeared even more imposing as he floated in the air. The magic elements around his body leaped joyfully. The dense magic aura seemed to make the originally invisible magic elements solid. All seven types of magic elements, without exception, revolved around his body, neatly divided into seven parts, ready to change at any moment.\n\nThe gaze between powerful individuals could easily cause energy resonance. Under the pressure brought by the opponent, the lights on both Nian Bing and Xijie clearly brightened. Xijie, like a suspended sun, flickered with dazzling golden light, and halos rippled downwards from top to bottom. Enveloped in the golden light, Xijie appeared almost invincible. Even his body seemed to be plated with a layer of gold leaf, and his head, clothes, and skin all shimmered with a noble golden aura. Nian Bing also underwent a change under Xijie's pressure. Seven-colored lights of blue, red, green, yellow, silver, white, and gold surrounded his body, extending to about one zhang. The seven colors constantly shifted positions, but each color was distinct and not mixed. Although the volume of the seven lights did not expand, their colors gradually deepened. Most strangely, Nian Bing's eyes had now turned golden, and in terms of aura, he was only slightly inferior to Xijie.\n\n\"Can you represent these people of the Guangling Continent?\" Xijie said calmly. To be able to withstand the first attack from the gods was not entirely due to luck for the Allied Forces of the Guangling Continent. Much could be seen from this powerful young man. Although on the surface this young man had not killed many gods, every god he had destroyed was a strong one among the gods. The deaths of two main gods, Gu Long and Noah, the serious injuries of two main gods, Xiayu and Kuangyun, coupled with the deaths of god-level experts, were all related to this young man in front of him.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"Although I cannot fully represent our army, Main God Xijie, you can speak if you have anything to say. Seeing you come alone, it seems you want to negotiate with us. However, considering the casualties and the harm inflicted on each other, I don't think there's much to discuss. Only when one side is completely destroyed can our hatred be resolved.\" Although a smile appeared on his face, his eyes were filled with coldness. Whether it was the destruction of the civilization on the Lost Continent, the death of the Dragon God, or the casualties of the four-nation alliance of the Guangling Continent under the gods, all had created an unforgettable hatred between the opposing sides. Such deep hatred could not be resolved through negotiation.\n\nXijie's expression remained calm, not provoked by the coldness in Nian Bing's tone. \"You are quite right. Only when one of us perishes can the problem be solved. However, do you think we are destined to lose? Numbers are not the fundamental reason for deciding a war. If you think the sheer numbers of those ordinary people can pose enough of a threat to us, then you underestimate us gods too much. War is inevitable. I am here this time to make a proposal, a proposal that would benefit both of us. That is to say, I want to change the form of this war.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment and looked at Xijie, a subtle change occurring in his heart. \"Main God, please speak. I wonder what good proposal you might have?\"\n\nXijie said, \"After the first encounter and battle, both our sides have suffered considerable losses. But I believe you can see that the main force of the gods is still intact. Therefore, our current strength is no weaker than yours. I believe you must admit this.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Yes, although your current numbers are less than half of what they were in the first battle, the majority of your strength remains.\" In the previous battle, although the gods suffered heavy casualties, most of those who died or were injured were only the lowest-ranking divine servants. It was precisely for this reason that the strength of both sides could still be considered balanced.\n\nXijie continued, \"If this war continues, regardless of which side achieves final victory, the ultimate result will be mutual destruction. Of your hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps less than one-tenth will be able to return. Do not think I am exaggerating. If I were to disregard the dignity of the gods and invade your army to fight together, with my speed and attack power, it would be almost impossible to stop me. Even if you were to use similar methods against my subordinates, the outcome would be the same.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing nodded. Xi Jie was right. Even if his own strength could contend with him, it would indeed be difficult to stop him if he deliberately tried. \"My Lord, please speak your mind directly. Perhaps your proposal will pique our interest.\"\n\nXi Jie gazed at Nian Bing and said, \"What I want to say is very simple. The outcome of this war is unpredictable for now, but we can miniaturize the war. My proposal is very simple: both our sides will send their strongest experts to conclude the entire war with a contest between a few individuals. Whichever side wins, the losing side must unconditionally self-destruct.\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred, and he immediately understood Xi Jie's meaning. He couldn't help but sneer and say, \"My Lord, are you joking? Setting aside the comparison of strength between our experts, your people's reputation alone makes me very worried.\n\nEven if we defeat your experts, so what? Will your people collectively commit suicide? Moreover, although the final outcome of this war is unpredictable, I believe that you, Lord Xi Jie, must also understand that we are more likely to win. Your proposal seems too preposterous.\"\n\nXi Jie looked at Nian Bing coldly and said, \"Don't you believe me? I said this is good for both of us. If you win, you can exchange all the lives of my people for the smallest price. If we win, then the Brilliance Continent will be ours. Deciding the outcome of the war with minimal losses is not without benefits for you. Do you want all your armies to be buried here? As for our reputation, I naturally have a way to prove it to you. We, in the Divine Continent, have three True Gods. They once taught me a curse called the Divine Curse. Making a vow within this curse is impossible to change. The curse will draw the essence of heaven and earth, and can be activated at any time. The Divine Curse will act according to the vows of both sides. If we lose in the end, then, without committing suicide, the Divine Curse can take away the lives of all my people.\"\n\nUpon hearing Xi Jie's words, Nian Bing's heart trembled. He also knew of the Divine Curse. This curse did exist. Kao and Tian Xiang had carefully explained the mysteries of this curse to him at the time. This ultimate curse could be considered a level sixteen magic. The radius of the curse after casting was as high as several hundred square kilometers. Except for those four True Gods, no one could escape this curse. At the same time, the conditions for using this curse were extremely harsh, requiring the blood sacrifice of a powerful living person, along with special methods to succeed. Although Xi Jie's strength was great, he was not a mage, nor was he as powerful as a True God. It seemed impossible for him to cast this curse.\n\nNian Bing asked with some doubt, \"My Lord Xi Jie, do you believe you can cast this curse?\"\n\nXi Jie said calmly, \"Why can't I? A long time ago, with the help of several True Gods, I completed this curse and sealed it within this Blood Curse Divine Stone.\" A faint red light lit up in front of Nian Bing. It was a dark red gemstone. The gem was very transparent, and although it emitted no magical elements or flashed any form of light, as soon as it appeared, Nian Bing felt his magical power and mental power instantly stagnate. The powerful pressure seemed to make all magical elements tremble in fear.\n\nXi Jie continued, \"Of course, I originally prepared this Divine Curse to enslave some important humans on the Brilliance Continent. Under my coercion, as long as they swore allegiance to me within the Divine Curse, they would forever become my subordinates, and even their descendants would pass on this curse. However, now I can only use it here. I don't fear telling you my purpose. I want to achieve ultimate victory with minimal losses. But whether victory ultimately belongs to us, I don't know yet. This Divine Curse now only requires a sufficiently strong blood sacrifice. This should prove my sincerity, shouldn't it? In the face of the Divine Curse, no reputation is needed at all.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Then, according to what you, Lord Xi Jie, intend, how will the contest of chosen experts in the vow be decided?\"\n\nXi Jie had clearly thought out his plan. He said calmly, \"It's very simple. You and I will each choose five people. Best of three wins. The losing side will be destroyed by the Divine Curse.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Lord Xi Jie, your calculations are quite good! You have four Lord Gods. With best of three wins, do we have a chance to win?\"\n\nXi Jie smiled faintly and said, \"This does not seem like something a strong person should say. Do you not have confidence in yourselves?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head and said, \"This is not a matter of confidence. When we have a certain advantage, why should I risk engaging in this best of three contest with you? How about this, Lord Xi Jie, let the two of us decide the outcome of this war. Under the witness of the Divine Curse, until death do us part.\" Nian Bing's gaze was firm as he met Xi Jie's eyes squarely.\n\nThis time, it was Xi Jie's turn to be surprised. \"You mean a one-on-one fight with me?\" He couldn't quite believe his ears. Although the aura emanating from this young man was powerful, it didn't seem sufficient to contend with him. He didn't quite understand why Nian Bing would make such a choice.\n\nNian Bing said with a firm tone, \"That's right, a one-on-one fight between you and me. Of course, there is one thing I need to remind you: I have my own mount and weapon. These should be counted as part of my personal strength, right?\"\n\nAlthough there was no outward change in Xi Jie, his mind was constantly calculating. He knew that since Nian Bing dared to make such a proposal, he must have his own confidence. Under such circumstances, he had to be extremely cautious. After all, this battle was too important for the gods. Xi Jie made this decision after careful consideration. Although he didn't have absolute certainty that he could defeat all the opposing experts, only in this way could he gain the greatest benefit from victory. Xi Jie was gambling, gambling on what he was most confident in.\n\nHis thoughts raced. Xi Jie recalled Nian Bing's performance in the first battle. At that time, he hadn't paid much attention to Nian Bing. In his eyes, Nian Bing's strongest combat power was naturally mental power physical attacks, and some magical assistance. Hearing him mention his weapon and mount at this moment, he remembered that this mage was also a dragon mage, and he seemed to have the strength to use divine artifacts. Calculating it this way, perhaps his overall strength was indeed not inferior to his own. But now, did Xi Jie have any other options? He also had no confidence in best of three wins. Although several of his Lord Gods were not weak, the Heavenly God Kuang Yun was still recovering from serious injuries, and the Silver God Sezier was too cunning. Ever since his abilities were lost, his morale had dropped to the extreme. The other side also had a few level fourteen experts. The outcome was difficult to predict. And the God of Exploration, Luosuo, although he had a certain chance of winning, coupled with himself, it would only be two wins. If this young and powerful mage chose Luosuo as his opponent, then even best of three wins would be difficult to achieve victory. Since that was the case, why not put the duel in his own hands? As the King of Lord Gods, would he be afraid of a human youth? Thinking of this, Xi Jie's pride surged. He nodded and said, \"Alright, then the two of us will decide the outcome of this war.\"\n\n\"Nian Bing.\" Feng Nu and Lan Chen called out to remind him. They had witnessed Xi Jie's power with their own eyes, so how could they be willing to let Nian Bing take such a risk?\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"It's alright. This might be the best way. If I can win, then our army won't have to suffer such heavy losses, right? Lord Xi Jie, please wait a moment. We will discuss it. I think you should also start preparing the Divine Curse.\"\n\nXi Jie nodded. After watching the three of them return, he also flew back to his people. He had already decided who would be the blood sacrifice for the Divine Curse.\n\nReturning to the front of the allied army of the Brilliance Continent, Feng Nu said anxiously, \"Nian Bing, how could you agree to him? Haven't you seen Xi Jie's strength? He is a level fifteen ultimate expert.\"\n\nThe gazes of Luo Rou and the others were also focused on Nian Bing. Because the distance was too far, they hadn't heard the conversation between Nian Bing and Xi Jie. Nian Bing glanced at Feng Nu and smiled, \"What, you don't have confidence in your husband? Although Xi Jie is a level fifteen expert, your husband is also a level fourteen ultimate expert. Coupled with the level fourteen senior Black Warrior Emperor, the other six Blade Souls, and Oscar, my overall strength may not be weaker than Xi Jie's. The Divine Curse is a very overbearing curse. If I can defeat Xi Jie, then the cost of this war will be greatly reduced. Xi Jie was right, if he killed indiscriminately, even I couldn't stop him, and at that time, too many people would die.\" Without waiting for Luo Rou and the others to ask, Nian Bing carefully explained Xi Jie's proposal. After hearing Nian Bing's words, the leaders of the four-nation allied forces fell into deep thought.\n\nPrince Rong looked even older than in the first battle. Unlike Cha Ji, he had no energy within his body, making his physique easily changeable. With Prince Rong's magical cultivation and his natural magic resistance, Nian Bing could only gradually restore his body and magic power by exhausting all his strength. \"Nian Bing, isn't your decision too bold? You must know that this concerns the lives of hundreds of thousands of people on our side. If you fight with Xi Jie, it is equivalent to a gamble, and your stake is these hundreds of thousands of troops, all human experts, and even the future of the entire Brilliance Continent.\"\n\nNian Bing naturally understood Prince Rong's meaning and smiled slightly. \"Grandpa, you should know that I am by no means someone with inflated confidence. Indeed, I do not have absolute confidence that I can defeat Xi Jie. However, is his Divine Curse really that miraculous? The Divine Curse is indeed something that experts below level sixteen cannot violate. Once the curse is generated, it will exert its power at the end of the vow. However, Xi Jie has too much confidence in this curse. The Divine Curse is the special ability of the God of Order, the God of Time, and the God of Destruction. As the opposite of those three True Gods, the God of Life and the God of Death also have their own counter-measures. I think Xi Jie does not know my relationship with those two True Gods. He has the Divine Curse, don't I also have a way to counteract the curse? Indeed, gambling with the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and the future of the Brilliance Continent is too costly. However, if this gamble requires us to pay no stakes, is it worth it?\"\n\nPrince Rong was startled and said, \"Are you saying you have a way to counteract the Divine Curse? But, as the King of Gods, would he be so easily deceived?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"Although he is the King of Gods, he has too much confidence in himself and too much confidence in the Divine Curse. What I am exploiting is precisely this. There isn't much time now, and I don't have time to explain too much to you. My fight with Xi Jie will definitely not be completed in a short time. While we are in our decisive battle, you begin your preparations. If I win, all problems will naturally be solved. Under the effect of the Divine Curse, these gods will disappear forever. But if I lose, you act immediately. I believe that even if there is a gap between me and Xi Jie, this gap will be very small. Even if he can defeat me, he will have to pay a great price himself. At that time, as long as you make a full-force attack, you will surely be able to destroy him. The remaining three Lord Gods among the gods are far inferior to us in overall strength. What they can rely on now is Xi Jie's power. My decisive battle with Xi Jie is equivalent to a siege by two level fourteen experts, six level thirteen experts, and one giant dragon. As long as you are prepared, and when I lose, you deal a heavy blow to the gods, then this war victory will still belong to us. Because they will think that the Divine Curse will take effect on us, their defenses will inevitably be weakened. After a single blow, I believe that victory will no longer be in doubt.\"\n\nNian Bing naturally did not agree to Xi Jie without considering it. When Kao mentioned the Divine Curse to him, he had specifically taught him a method to deal with this curse, precisely because he was afraid that Nian Bing would encounter any of the three True Gods or face this curse, and be enslaved unknowingly, as Xi Jie had said.\n\nAt that time, the three True Gods assisted the gods in becoming powerful, which was actually for the blood sacrifice of the Divine Curse. If it were not for Kao and Tian Xiang posing too great a threat to them, perhaps these three True Gods would have already acted upon the world with the Divine Curse.",

    "content": "Because this would be a gamble with no stakes, Nian Bing agreed to Xi Jie after careful consideration. Xi Jie was confident, and Nian Bing was equally confident in himself. He would use this final battle to test his comprehensive strength after so many years of cultivation. Ever since he acquired the seven Blade Souls and the ability for mental energy to manifest physical attacks, he had never fought someone using his full strength. Therefore, Nian Bing himself didn't know his own comprehensive strength.\n\nListening to Nian Bing's explanation, the commanders representing the four great empires had no further doubts about his decision. Victory would be ideal, but even in defeat, there was still a good chance of defeating the opponent. In their eyes, the King of the Gods, Xi Jie, had essentially cornered himself. At this moment, no one would call Nian Bing's plan despicable. Whether it was the Allied Forces of the Radiant Continent or the former Lost Continent, the hatred towards the God race was essentially ethnic hatred. True victory could only be achieved by completely destroying the opponent. In such circumstances, how could anything be too despicable? As the saying goes, one general's success is built on ten thousand bones; ultimate victory is the most important thing. However, the high-ranking officials of the four-nation allied forces were still worried. They weren't worried about anything else but Nian Bing's safety. They were all very confident in Nian Bing and completely believed that even if Xi Jie defeated him, Xi Jie himself would be severely injured. However, another problem faced them: if the victorious Xi Jie were severely injured, what would happen to the defeated Nian Bing?\n\nNian Bing sensed the unspoken questions in everyone's gazes. He raised his hands to his chest and smiled faintly. \"Trust me. I can only tell you that even though he is the King of the Gods, it will be a hundred times more difficult for him to kill me than to defeat me. On the battlefield, there can be no hesitation. Wait for my good news. I will do my best to achieve victory in this battle.\" After saying this, Nian Bing walked to the side and whispered something into Youyou's ear. Youyou looked at him with a complex gaze and nodded gently.\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly and said to those around him, \"Be ready at all times to respond to any changes.\" There was no need to say more. He knew that Luo Rou would arrange everything.\n\nUnder the shroud of seven-colored light, Nian Bing rose and returned to the vast sky.\n\nXi Jie had also returned as Nian Bing ascended into the air. Alongside him in the air was another God race member. Kuang Yun, who was once second only to Xi Jie among the God Kings.\n\nNian Bing glanced at Kuang Yun. Although Kuang Yun's eyes were filled with hatred, they were clearly a bit vacant and lacked vitality. His face was also very pale, clearly not having recovered from the blow Nian Bing had dealt him that day. However, Nian Bing did admire the God King. He had survived being attacked with all his spiritual power, even at the cost of his life. The strength of this God King was indeed praiseworthy. Unfortunately, today, he could only be a sacrificial pawn.\n\nKuang Yun naturally did not know his fate, or he would not have ascended into the air with Xi Jie. Xi Jie's gaze was calm. Without the blood of a God King, how could the Curse of the Gods be activated? The energy injected into the Blood Curse God Stone by the three True Gods was sufficient, but for him to activate a level sixteen magic, without a blood sacrifice, the backlash alone would be enough to cost him his life, let alone retain strength to fight Nian Bing. Therefore, he chose Kuang Yun, the weakest among the current God Kings.\n\n\"Have you made your arrangements?\" Xi Jie looked at Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing was currently looking at God King Kuang Yun. In the concept of the God race, there truly was no emotion. Whether it was family affection or friendship. At this moment, he couldn't help but feel a bit of pity for Kuang Yun. He certainly didn't think Xi Jie brought Kuang Yun up to ambush him. As Xi Jie had said, for experts of their level, it was difficult for even experts of the same level to stop them if they tried to escape, and in that case, the God race would gain no benefit at all.\n\n\"Yes, I am ready. We, the Allied Forces of the Radiant Continent, agree to turn this final war into a decisive battle between the two of us. Just as you are confident in yourself, my friends have the same confidence in me.\"\n\nXi Jie glanced at Kuang Yun faintly and said, \"Very well, let's begin now.\"\n\nGod King Kuang Yun had not yet reacted to the meaning behind their simple conversation when Xi Jie's incantation began. It was indeed strange to hear a warrior with a martial skill as high as level fifteen chanting a spell. However, his incantation did not have the characteristics of a mage. Mages needed to use a special rhythm and tone when chanting spells to resonate with the magic elements. But Xi Jie's tone did not change at all, nor did he pause in any way. It was like reciting, and he quickly completed his incantation.\n\n\"Infinite divine power shall transform into endless sighs. Wind spirits, please surround me and form a barrier of chaos; water spirits, please transform into gentle waves and condense into a mirror of time; earth spirits, please abandon your mutual animosity and release the bonds of the soul; fire spirits, please condense into lotus chains of red and weave into a net of space. Four great elements, lend me the power of your hearts and forge an eternal, inexplicable bond. From the beginning of nothingness to the end of chaos, please cease all fluctuations, using the sighs of gods as the source of the curse, and the power of elements as the substance of the curse. Pure blood shall be the guide of the curse. Forge a covenant of curses, the Spear of Curse.\"\n\nAs the incantation was completed, four-colored lights appeared simultaneously around Xi Jie's body: the green barrier of chaos, the blue mirror of brilliance, the yellow vortex of waves, and the sacred lotus of fire condensed from red flames. The four-colored lights were not dazzling, but as the Blood Curse God Stone appeared, the four-colored lights poured into it in an instant.\n\nGolden light shone brightly around Xi Jie's body. God King Kuang Yun was horrified to find that his body had suddenly become rigid. That was clearly Xi Jie's power! At this critical juncture of life and death, his consciousness suddenly became completely clear, but his clarity was ultimately too late. With a gaze filled with endless resentment and unwillingness, Xi Jie's large hand landed on his head. The God King's tall and imposing body was instantly enveloped by a bloody light, and golden brilliance blazed within the bloody light. What Xi Jie wanted was not only his blood but also his vast energy cultivated over ten thousand years!\n\nThe Blood Curse God Stone floated into view. The bloody light formed by God King Kuang Yun was instantly absorbed by it. The immense bloody light filled the entire God Stone. \"I, Xi Jie, King of the God race, swear before the Curse of the Gods, if I fail in my battle against the human representative of the Radiant Continent, I shall pay with the lives of the entire God race,\" Xi Jie said calmly, swearing before the Curse of the Gods.\n\nSeeing Xi Jie's gaze turn towards him, Nian Bing did not hesitate at all. He responded, \"I, Nian Bing, swear before the Curse of the Gods, if I fail in my battle against the God Xi Jie, I shall pay with the lives of the Allied Forces of the Radiant Continent.\"\n\nXi Jie nodded at Nian Bing and said loudly, \"Curse of the Gods! Please become the witness to our oath and make the fairest judgment with your bloody brilliance.\" As soon as his voice fell, the bloody light emitted by the Blood God Stone suddenly retracted. Suddenly, the God Stone let out a crisp cracking sound, and a ray of rainbow light, only as thick as a finger, shot up into the sky and disappeared in an instant.\n\nThe bloody light disappeared into the sky, and the air seemed to become somewhat gloomy. Two faint, ethereal wisps of qi floated among the clouds. The magic elements in the air seemed to be covered with a layer of bloody radiance. That deep energy brought a chilling sensation.\n\nXi Jie looked at Nian Bing, and Nian Bing was also looking at him. As the strongest representatives of their respective sides, there was no need for further words. Actions were enough to express everything. Xi Jie's body instantly erupted with an unusually intense golden light. Nian Bing could clearly see three golden light spots appear on his opponent's left leg and chest. Immediately after, Xi Jie's body was completely enveloped by solid golden light. The powerful aura did not disperse but instead converged inward, losing its oppressive feeling but bringing with it terror.\n\nNian Bing was also not idle. Seven-colored brilliance spread out in a planar shape. The ten Blade Souls, led by the Black Emperor, emerged. Gray light points condensed beneath him. With a clear dragon's roar, the little Dragon King Oscar, with a body that had grown even larger than before, proudly supported Nian Bing. The gray scales on his body shone with a crystalline luster, and a faint golden-gray airflow emanated from him.\n\nUnder the condition of soul unity, Nian Bing communicated with Oscar through his thoughts. The communication between the man and the dragon was completed in an instant. In a sense, Oscar's body was now controlled by Nian Bing. Light and shadow surged and flashed. Nian Bing's body suddenly flickered, and he, along with Oscar, floated into the air from nowhere. The seven Blade Souls, each shining with a different luster, instantly lined up and raised their seven divine blades. The Heavenly Eye Domain descended like a giant light shield, gracefully covering Xi Jie and the seven Blade Souls.\n\nOnly in such a face-to-face confrontation could one truly feel the power of the King of the Gods. The intense golden light emanating from Xi Jie's body could not even be weakened by the Heavenly Eye Domain.\n\nA golden long saber appeared in Xi Jie's hand. His ethereal figure floated up, gripped the saber with both hands, and slashed obliquely at the sky. That saber strike was as elusive as a sheep's hoof hanging from a branch, and the faint saber light brought a world-shattering rainbow. What was strange to both sides watching below was that Xi Jie's saber strike was directed at the empty sky, not at the seven Blade Souls.\n\nAn ethereal sensation simultaneously appeared on the seven Blade Souls, each carrying a completely different light. Long afterimages trailed behind each Blade Soul. Xi Jie's body was instantly covered by these afterimages. In mid-air, with a clear dragon's roar, Nian Bing and Oscar appeared. The place they appeared was precisely where Xi Jie's saber strike was directed.\n\nIt is difficult for those who are not involved to understand the current situation. Why would Nian Bing deliver himself to the saber's edge? Only Nian Bing knew the hardship. He had not expected Xi Jie's perception to be so keen, accurately pinpointing their location after they achieved invisibility through spatial magic and blink-teleportation abilities. That saber strike seemed to be just a saber light, but as the saber light pierced through, the aura and domineering presence emanating from the saber had already completely locked onto Nian Bing's body. Therefore, Nian Bing's only choice now was to meet it head-on.\n\nA golden-gray lightning bolt shot out from Oscar's mouth, accurately hitting the golden saber light. The sky immediately resounded with thunderous roars, and golden light permeated the air. The ethereal golden saber light was significantly weakened, but Oscar's breath attack did not stop its continued assault.\n\nA layer of golden-gray light emanated from Oscar's body. His beating dragon wings clearly slowed down, obviously affected by the recoil force. At this moment, a faint silver light emerged, centered on Nian Bing. The instant the golden saber light came into contact with the silver light, it actually changed direction and slid away into the distance.\n\nThe Illusionary Domain of Interlacing, through Nian Bing's continuous efforts, could finally be completed without chanting spells. If there was any power in this world that could resist the attack of the Emperor Extreme Acupoint, it would be the Heavenly Eye Acupoint. Of course, the abilities of the Heavenly Eye Acupoint had to be manifested in a special form, and this Illusionary Domain of Interlacing was precisely such a special form.\n\nSurging qi erupted like dry thunder, making the sky tremble. The attack method of the seven Blade Souls was very simple. Under the amplification of the Heavenly Eye Domain, their speed advantage, which was inherent to their energy bodies, was no less than Xi Jie's Ultimate Earth Spirit Acupoint at this moment. This was also one of Nian Bing's advantages.\n\nA gap of over a hundred has been bridged, and the book has entered its final stages. For friends who like it, please vote more and support Xiao San. Thank you.\n\nTonight at 12:05, the advanced meeting will be held as usual. Friends are welcome to attend.",

    "content": "Dark Dragon King Kajiusis stared in surprise at his son in the sky. He never imagined that Oscar would have reached the realm of breathing lightning, a realm he himself had only recently achieved after strenuous cultivation of the Dragon God Heart Technique. Oscar, born less than two years ago, had already become so powerful.\n\nXijie showed no panic in the face of the blade souls that suddenly sealed off all his escape routes. If it weren't a duel, he could have broken through with his own strength, but in this situation, he saw it as a very good opportunity. He pressed his right hand forward in the air, feigned a move with his left leg, and two golden lights firmly protected his body. A milky white light emanated from his back, which immediately turned golden, forming a large golden shield that expanded outwards. With the aid of the two Royal Pole acupoints, the defense of the Ultimate Armor acupoint was raised to its extreme. Each time one of the seven blade souls swung a blade within the formation, its body would immediately change position to prevent Xijie from locking on.\n\nNianbing knew very well that although Xijie appeared to be defending, he could launch a lightning-fast attack at any moment. Despite his strange posture, the energy within the two Royal Pole acupoints in his right hand and left leg was becoming increasingly concentrated. At this moment, Nianbing suddenly understood why Xijie could neutralize the fire magic cast by a thousand mages single-handedly, because his battle qi could be compressed to an unprecedented level. His third Royal Pole acupoint, like Nianbing's own Royal Pole acupoint, was a dual-acupoint combination. However, what was combined with his Royal Pole acupoint was not the Heavenly Eye acupoint, but the Fierce Middle acupoint. After the Fierce Middle acupoint merged with the Royal Pole acupoint, it not only made the center of Xijie's chest the strongest point but also greatly enhanced the Fierce Middle acupoint's ability to condense battle qi. With the effect of these two powerful acupoints, no one could be more condensed in battle qi than Xijie. It was precisely because of this that he was able to defeat the combined magic of the thousand mages using the technique of breaking the whole with a point.\n\nAfter diverting Xijie's first attack, the silver light emitted by Nianbing did not disappear. He closed his eyes, observing everything around him solely through the Heavenly Eye acupoint. The silver light permeated the air, radiating a strange aura. The moment the silver light merged with the bodies of the seven blade souls, Xijie's vision blurred, and he could no longer distinguish between the real and the fake blade souls. The afterimages, which were originally illusions, no longer moved in the same direction as the blade souls but flashed around his body in a chaotic manner. Xijie could not discern the targets of these blade souls. He could only vaguely sense that the energy brought by the seven blade souls had become unpredictable. Unable to grasp their true movements, Xijie had to temporarily halt the energy he had been accumulating in his two Royal Pole acupoints.\n\nUnder the dual suppression of the Illusory Domain and the Heavenly Eye Domain, although the blade souls' attacks were repelled by Xijie's formidable defenses, it had become impossible for him to locate Nianbing. Within the Illusory Domain, everything could be false, but everything could also be true. Nianbing possessed a mental power that Xijie could not compare with. In terms of creating domains that affect opponents, Xijie could not compare with him at all.\n\nStanding below, everyone watched nervously, especially Nianbing's three wives, who clenched their fists. After all, their husband was facing the strongest among the divine beings. Xijie was by no means easy to deal with. Although Nianbing appeared to have gained a slight advantage, it did not represent victory yet.\n\nYu Ruyan frowned and said, \"Nianbing is too focused on his ability to confuse opponents; I'm afraid he'll suffer.\" Seeing the puzzled looks from the surrounding people, Duke Lan Yu explained on behalf of his wife, \"Nianbing's illusory domain combined with the attack of the blade souls can indeed be called a killing blow, and it can keep him out of harm's way from counterattacks. If he were facing an ordinary opponent, or an opponent with similar characteristics, this tactic would undoubtedly be successful. But unfortunately, he is facing Xijie, who possesses absolute energy. Although I don't know the mysteries within Nianbing's domain, as long as Xijie's energy is strong enough, he can completely break through the skill with power.\"\n\nAs soon as Duke Lan Yu finished speaking, the situation between the two sides battling in the sky changed. Nianbing, in the air, chanted something softly, while Xijie made his move. He seemed to randomly strike dozens of palms around his body, holding his golden saber upside down with his left hand, with surging battle qi scattering everywhere. Although the Illusory Domain had the effect of changing the direction of the enemy's energy attacks, it also depended on the intensity of the enemy's attacking energy. With Xijie's strength, Nianbing could only cause some deviation in the attacks; it was impossible to reflect such energy.\n\nXijie let out a long roar, and a dazzling golden light emanated from his body. The golden saber in his hand slashed out a saber aura as if splitting the heavens and the earth. With both hands exerting force simultaneously, the saber aura was extremely condensed, only three feet long when it emerged from the saber. The Heavenly Eye Domain, being a spirit-based domain, was naturally not affected by it. However, the Illusory Domain changed. Xijie's saber actually cut a small crack in the air. The spatial distortion tore the Illusory Domain to shreds. Amidst the flashing golden light, Xijie directly clashed with the seven blade souls simultaneously. The seven blade souls were sent flying in all directions, and their afterimages disappeared along with them. Xijie broke through the encirclement at a speed imperceptible to the naked eye. The spatial crack he had created generated a great suction force, momentarily pulling the bodies of the seven blade souls, while he himself rushed directly towards Nianbing, who was sitting on Oscar's back in the air.\n\nLittle Dragon King Oscar once again spewed out streams of golden-gray lightning. Xijie did not dodge, but continued to charge straight at Nianbing. The golden-gray lightning was cleaved by the golden saber in his hand, unable to pause his movement in the slightest.\n\nThe spectators below held their breath, watching intently. Would this collision decide the outcome? Nianbing, separated from his blade souls, was clearly at a disadvantage. Based on his previous performance, without the assistance of the blade souls, he had no way of blocking Xijie's attack!\n\nNianbing's eyes had now turned completely silver. Just as Xijie thought he was about to launch a spiritual physical attack, the space suddenly changed again. Nianbing clasped his hands together in front of him, and the low chanting instantly stopped. He was not just an auxiliary mage; he was also a powerful mage! Two simple words came out of his mouth: \"Seal.\"\n\nXijie suddenly felt the surrounding air become viscous. Nianbing and Oscar's bodies disappeared again. This time, they manifested countless bodies and scattered in all directions. When Xijie's saber light was unleashed without hesitation, although it shattered Nianbing's thirteenth-order seal magic, he couldn't help but be stunned by the sudden appearance of hundreds of Nianbings and Oscars. In that moment of stunned hesitation, the seven blade souls simultaneously surrounded him.\n\nHundreds of Nianbings began chanting simultaneously, while those hundreds of Oscars continuously spewed out lightning, cooperating with the blade souls' attacks to suppress Xijie once again. If Duke Lan Yu and his wife could foresee that the Illusory Domain could not seal Xijie, how could Nianbing not?\n\nThis time, Nianbing's incantation became clear, and everyone below could hear it distinctly. From the moment his incantation began, the air became condensed again. Large patches of dark clouds appeared in the sky without warning, blocking the sunlight, making the entire world seem to dim at that moment.\n\nXijie had been prepared to deal with Nianbing's spiritual physical attacks, but he never expected that Nianbing would not use his only spiritual power that could threaten him. And those seven blade souls, amplified by his Heavenly Eye acupoint, were indeed troublesome. Not only was their speed astonishing, but each of their attacks was a point breaking through a surface. Even Xijie had to pay full attention and avoid being attacked multiple times at the same point by these seven blade souls. Although his saber aura was powerful, as blade souls of seven peerless divine sabers, their speed and coordination were extremely默契. When the seven sabers were unleashed together, they created a strange force field. Although it could not harm Xijie, to break through them or destroy any one of the blade souls, Xijie would have to pay a certain price.\n\n\"Combine! The traces of the sun's light and the moon's guidance, on the dark path, illuminate the brilliant golden road.\"\n\nAll the Nianbings turned golden at this moment, their faces radiating sacred light as they chanted piously. The magic elements in the air seemed to freeze, listening to his magnetic voice.\n\n\"Ever-flowing springs! Those continuous white silks, respond to my call and gather into the river of dreams.\"\n\n\"Through the silent mountains, pour into the real sea, let the seeds of hope take root in the promised land!\"\n\n\"Grow into the ever-green World Tree, bear the goose-yellow fruits, scatter the pure white wings, and soar over the broken land.\"\n\n\"And ignite the eternal inextinguishable flames, transform into endless red lotuses, weave each other's wishes, scatter the burning vows, to awaken the slumbering earth.\"\n\nHundreds of Nianbings chanted the same incantation, not in the alternating chanting method to increase speed like Lan Chen did before, but in their melodious tones, their chanting was very fast. By the time the first few lines were finished, Xijie was surrounded by the seven blade souls and launching the first wave of attacks.\n\nWhile conversing with his father, Rong Tian asked doubtfully, \"What incantation is Nianbing chanting? Judging from the initial intonation, this incantation is unimaginably long.\"\n\nPrince Rong smiled bitterly and shook his head, \"I have never seen this incantation in any records. Indeed, this is obviously a very long incantation. From my experience, the longer the incantation, the more terrifying its power. To destroy a strong person like Xijie, Nianbing must have his reasons for using this magic. With Nianbing's strength, it requires such a long incantation to complete, so the destructive power of this incantation must be extremely terrifying. I can be sure that this will be a seven-element fusion ultimate forbidden spell, and this is the first time I've seen such an incantation. In ancient legends, it is said that when a mage can communicate perfectly with all magic elements, they can create their own magic. Perhaps our Nianbing has reached this realm. This might very well be the longest incantation in the history of magic.\"\n\nRong Tian gasped, \"You mean this is Nianbing's self-created magic? Is that possible?\"\n\nPrince Rong did not answer, but nodded firmly, his eyes shining with fervent light. As a mage, there was nothing more exciting than witnessing an ultimate magic. He was filled with pride for his grandson. At this moment, Nianbing's incantation was still ongoing.\n\n\"Combine! The power of the seven lights passed down from ancient times to the present.\"\n\n\"Goddess of Ice and Snow, you are the gentle blue moon.\"\n\n\"God of Fire, you are the red morning glow sun.\"\n\n\"God of Wind, you are the fast-flowing green moon.\"\n\n\"Goddess of Earth, you are the yellow sun that nurtures all life.\"\n\n\"God of Space, you are the magical silver moon.\"\n\n\"God of Light, you are the glorious golden sun.\"\n\n\"God of Darkness! You are the representative of endless consumption, the silent purple sun.\"\n\n\"Resonate on the dark earth, break the long-sealed wheel of fate, shatter the lost self's illusory time and space, and shine forth your most beautiful radiance, destruction. Awakening of the Seven Luminaries.\"\n\nWhile Rong Tian and Prince Rong were talking, Xijie also felt that something was wrong. As the King of the Main Gods and the owner of three Royal Pole acupoints, he had always believed that magic was a joke to him. Such scattered energy could not have any effect on his defense. However, when he heard Nianbing chanting, all the magic elements in the surrounding space were instantly drained, and the world around him became a strange vacuum without magic elements. And where those vanished magic elements condensed, it seemed to be the bodies of the seven blade souls.",

    "content": "A hint of panic rose in Xi Jie's heart. Guided by his extensive combat experience, he knew he absolutely could not allow Nian Bing to complete this incantation.\n\nWhen he sensed something was wrong, his body suddenly lunged forward, the Dou Qi in his Huangji acupoint bursting to its limit. But just then, Nian Bing precisely completed the phrase, \"Ice and Snow Goddess, you are the blue, gentle moon.\" The seven Saber Souls' forms flashed and turned, the blue Morning Dew Saber moving to the very front. The Saber Soul suddenly dissipated, revealing the Morning Dew Saber's true form, and the next moment, the light emitted from the saber blade became exceptionally strong. Bing Ling's blue light condensed into a crescent moon, perfectly blocking Xi Jie's attack. Although Xi Jie's attack intensity was extremely high, a bizarre scene appeared at this moment. Blue moonlight rose into the sky, and as it ascended, it actually deflected Xi Jie's attack, while the other six Saber Souls had already dodged.\n\nXi Jie's subsequent attacks met a similar fate. As Nian Bing's swift incantations were completed one by one, the seven Saber Souls all disappeared. Each transformed into a dazzling ray of light, not confronting Xi Jie head-on, but instead directly deflecting his energy as they ascended. Before the final incantation appeared, Xi Jie saw the seven Saber Souls disappear. Just as he thought he could attack Nian Bing's true form, he was shocked to find that Nian Bing's body had become illusory. Hundreds of Nian Bings appeared, none of them appearing to be the real body. Even with his powerful strength, it was impossible to attack so many Nian Bings simultaneously. Whether it was Nian Bing himself or his possession of the Little Dragon King Oscar, both could threaten Xi Jie, so he could only charge in one direction.\n\nUnfortunately, Xi Jie's understanding of space-elemental magic was still not profound enough. With Nian Bing's current magical strength, any of these illusory figures could be real, and any could be fake. Under the effect of the magic, Nian Bing's true form was constantly moving.\n\n\"Destroy. Destroy.\" {Replacement} \"Awakening of the Seven Luminaries.\"\n\nUpon this simple word, \"Destroy,\" Nian Bing placed a heavy emphasis, as if striking Xi Jie's heart with a heavy hammer. The physical mental attack that Xi Jie had been waiting for suddenly appeared at this moment. As his brain experienced dizziness, Xi Jie suddenly understood that Nian Bing intended to use this magic to decide the victor with him. In this magic, he had undoubtedly poured all his abilities.\n\nFrom the beginning of the decisive battle, Nian Bing had already launched his plan. Of course, he knew that his own strength still had a gap compared to Xi Jie. Although the seven Saber Souls and the Little Dragon King Oscar possessed extraordinary strength, their power was ultimately difficult to stack. Xi Jie's Dou Qi, under the effect of the three Huangji acupoints, was extremely condensed. Whether in terms of explosiveness or endurance, it was far superior to his own. Once the seven Saber Souls were consumed one by one in the struggle with Xi Jie, then, he would ultimately face defeat. Therefore, from the very moment the battle began, Nian Bing had started laying the groundwork. Whether it was the encirclement by the seven Saber Souls assisted by the Heavenly Eye Domain, or the interference of the Illusionary Domain of Interlacing, it was all about gradually unfolding this scheme. What he wanted to do was use a special method to concentrate all the power he possessed and decide the victor with Xi Jie in the shortest possible time, before the energy of the Saber Souls was depleted by Xi Jie.\n\nThe \"Awakening of the Seven Luminaries,\" as Prince Rong had said, was a magic Nian Bing had researched based on his own characteristics. In this magic, not only his magic power was integrated, but also the abilities of all seven Saber Souls and the seven Divine Sabers, as well as his own mental strength. By concentrating all his abilities into one magic, Nian Bing had almost emptied himself. Under his overall control, he completed this magic before Xi Jie could understand.\n\nAt the final moment of the magic's completion, Nian Bing gathered all his mental strength and seized the best opportunity amidst Xi Jie's slight panic to deliver a full-force physical mental attack. The mastery of this rhythm allowed Nian Bing to unleash his full strength. Under the pressure of a powerful existence like Xi Jie, he could be said to be performing at his peak level.\n\nNian Bing was not afraid of his mental energy being overused and losing control of the completed magic. The most terrifying aspect of \"Awakening of the Seven Luminaries\" was that it was a purely single-target attack magic. Therefore, before casting the magic, Nian Bing had not warned the Allied Forces of the Yangguang Continent because he knew that his magic would not affect those below. The moment the magic was completed, his mental energy had already completely locked onto Xi Jie, and the magic would automatically target and attack.\n\nXi Jie was indeed somewhat panicked at this moment. Although he had been prepared, facing Nian Bing's physical mental attack, he did not suffer any real damage due to the strong compression and protection of his own mental energy by the Huangji acupoints. However, the brief mental disorientation caused him to lose the sense of the magical elemental fluctuations in the air. In a duel between masters, this brief moment was already a huge advantage.\n\nHowever, Xi Jie was worthy of being the King of Gods, the strongest among the divine beings. In a moment of crisis, under mental disorientation, he made the most correct choice. Resplendent golden light instantly erupted, emitting a destructive radiance. Xi Jie's upper clothes completely burst, revealing a solid muscle like granite. His hair stood on end, and his entire body completely transformed into a golden solid form. Vast energy converged instantly, and a circle of blackness appeared around his body. It was not light, but gave a feeling of emptiness. The powerful observers below were horrified to find that the intensity of Xi Jie's Dou Qi had directly torn through space, forming a black hole around his body. Since he was going all out, Xi Jie no longer needed to hold back his strength.\n\nIn the overcast sky, seven cracks appeared, and seven clusters of light simultaneously lit up. The blue moon, the red sun, the cyan moon, the yellow sun, the silver moon, the golden sun, surrounding the last appearing purple sun, which was filled with a solemn aura, brought a brilliant seven-colored light to heaven and earth. The air seemed to freeze. The powerful beings who possessed innate strength realized that at this moment, there was no innate energy left in heaven and earth.\n\nNian Bing and Oscar's hundreds of illusory figures vanished at this moment. The seven luminaries in the sky simultaneously shot out a light column with a diameter of ten feet. The light column appeared to be a solid entity. The seven-colored light column flickered slightly and then condensed together in the air.\n\nXi Jie's eyes shone brightly. He brought his hands together in front of himself, and vast energy instantly surged. The black space surrounding his body had now expanded to a radius of ten feet. Looking up at the sun and moon shining with seven different colors, his gaze became exceptionally stern. Although Nian Bing's mental attack had a certain impact on him, preventing him from finding Nian Bing's current location, it did not prevent him from unleashing his full strength.\n\n\"Gods destroy all things, all laws return to one. Behold my ultimate profound meaning: Devouring Radiance.\" The torn black space, driven by his gradually pushing hands, moved out from around his body, transforming into a gigantic black sphere of light. The sphere was outlined with golden light around its edges. This was clearly not energy, but a real black hole.\n\nThe power of the three moons and four suns converged into one in the air. The seven-colored light suddenly dimmed, and a giant seven-colored crystal sphere formed out of thin air. Would the Seven Luminaries destroy the God King, or would the God King devour the Seven Luminaries? Everyone held their breath at this moment.\n\nThe Devouring Radiance, enveloped in golden light, suddenly rose, meeting the seven-colored crystal sphere that was descending from the sky. At this moment, it seemed as if only these two circular existences remained in heaven and earth. No one could understand what such power represented, but almost everyone knew that this represented the final duel of the strongest of both sides.\n\nOn one side were the Seven Luminaries, representing the vitality of all things in heaven and earth. On the other side, the Devourer, representing the destruction of everything. In the distorted, fluctuating space, the two evenly matched balls of light slowly merged.\n\nThere was no sound of explosion or fluctuation of energy. The moment they completely merged, everything around them changed. All living beings present simultaneously lost their six senses. The surroundings turned into an endless darkness. Even those who were standing beside them could no longer feel them. This strange sensation was excruciatingly painful.\n\nFear appeared in the hearts of the gods, and simultaneously, in the hearts of the Allied Forces of the Yangguang Continent. Everyone clearly felt that they had been isolated in this world, their actions completely lost. Even powerful warriors were as fragile as porcelain.\n\n...\n\nDivine Continent\n\nThree people who were cultivating simultaneously opened their eyes.\n\nThe God of Order frowned and said, \"Was it a mistake for us to decide to abandon those divine beings? I never expected Xi Jie's strength to reach such a level. From an ordinary person cultivating to his current realm, I can almost feel that if he could reach the Seven Acupoints, his strength might step into the threshold of true godhood.\"\n\nThe God of Time sighed and said, \"I don't know about this human who is confronting Xi Jie. The energy fluctuations produced are not much weaker than his. They seem to be a one-on-one duel. This is an energy battle approaching level sixteen! I recall that thirty thousand years ago, we only possessed such combat power. The human body, as the Father of Technology said, is an endless treasure vault. Whoever can master the key to opening this treasure vault will become the master of the entire world.\"\n\nThe God of Destruction was very quiet at this moment, a significant difference from his usual easily agitated personality. \"Everything has already happened, and discussing it further is meaningless. Let's continue. We are about to finish. Perhaps tomorrow will be the day we go to find Ka'ao and Tianxiang to end this fifty-thousand-year grievance.\"\n\nThe three true gods simultaneously closed their eyes. There were no energy fluctuations around their bodies, but at this moment, their bodies seemed to have merged together. Everything was frozen in the previous moment, and the surroundings had completely turned into darkness.\n\nWhen the sun's rays illuminated the Lost Continent, the dark clouds dispersed, the three moons and four suns disappeared, and the black hole that had instilled terror in everyone also vanished.\n\nThe Allied Forces of the Yangguang Continent and the gods regained themselves and their six senses. However, their hearts did not feel the slightest bit of ease. Looking up at the sky, they could even hear their own rapid heartbeats. Although most of these observers did not know the true significance of this battle, as long as they were intelligent, they understood that this battle would play a decisive role in the entire war. If Xi Jie lost, it would mean the complete loss of the spiritual pillar of the gods. If Nian Bing lost, it would mean the death of at least two level fourteen experts and seven level thirteen experts. No matter who was destroyed, their side would enter the current dead end.\n\nXi Jie floated calmly in mid-air. He was still bare-chested, but his standing hair had already neatly cascaded down his back. Ten feet in front of him, Nian Bing also floated quietly. At this moment, he was not using any magic, just hovering in the air opposite Xi Jie. Oscar and the seven Saber Souls had not appeared, and even the seven Divine Sabers had disappeared.\n\nIf Xi Jie's upper clothes had not been lost, perhaps people would think their battle had never begun, after all, everything that had happened earlier had brought too much of an illusion.\n\nNian Bing and Xi Jie looked at each other. Their gazes were both calm. Nian Bing's eyes shimmered with a clear light, while Xi Jie's gaze held a hint of venom.\n\n\"Your strength is still inferior to mine. Even after integrating so many abilities, you are still a step behind me. You are not a true level fifteen expert after all,\" Xi Jie's voice was filled with unwillingness.\n\nNian Bing raised his hand and pointed to his head, smiling faintly, \"Duels and wars are very similar. Absolute strength does not necessarily guarantee victory. Otherwise, you would have achieved victory at the beginning of the first war. Wisdom, whether in duels or wars, can play a very important role. That's right, I admit that in terms of strength, I am not your opponent. You are much stronger than me in many aspects. However, you gods have always been on the Divine Continent. Besides cultivation, you probably have no other pleasures, right? Therefore, although your strength is greater than mine, the gap between us now has disappeared, hasn't it? Lord Xi Jie.\"",

    "content": "Xi Jie looked at Nian Bing and nodded, saying, \"Correct. You used various circumstances to weaken my overall strength. I never expected you would choose to fight me with all your might right at the start of the decisive battle. However, this is indeed your best course of action. We fought for a day, and the outcome was undecided. I don't think there's a need to continue fighting.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and nodded, saying, \"Indeed. Now, we should both go back and prepare for the final decisive battle. This may be a contest on another level. Perhaps, you might be the victor in this battle.\"\n\nXi Jie gazed deeply at Nian Bing and said, \"Luck does not last forever; remember this. The God's Curse still exists. The final victory in this decisive battle will be settled with life. Only when one dies can the other truly achieve victory. Tomorrow, you will not have such an opportunity.\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"Then let us wait and see. Using strength to speak is the correct choice.\"\n\nThe two looked at each other deeply and vanished into the air.\n\nWhen Nian Bing and Xi Jie returned to their respective camps, they did the same thing. After a few simple instructions, they immediately entered a state of cultivation. The battle tomorrow would have no room for luck; victory and defeat, life and death, would be decided.\n\nIn the initial confrontation between Nian Bing and Xi Jie, Nian Bing had gained the advantage by relying on a pre-arranged plan. From the perspective of the decisive battle alone, Nian Bing was the victor. Relying on his strength, which was slightly inferior to Xi Jie's, and under the influence of various circumstances, he forced a draw against Xi Jie. Neither the Seven Luminaries Awakening nor the Devouring Luminaries had achieved victory. Nian Bing lost seven Blade Souls, while Xi Jie sustained more severe injuries than he did. After their ultimate clash, which produced no violent explosions, they had almost depleted all their strength. Nian Bing's mental power and magic power had both fallen to their lowest points. Moreover, he no longer had the assistance of the seven Blade Souls. Although Xi Jie still had some residual strength, under the illumination of the seven powerful and distinct lights of the Seven Luminaries, his injuries were much more serious than Nian Bing's. At that moment, both had only two options. One was to continue fighting. If they continued fighting, they would both have to do the same thing: self-detonate their acupoints. Without the energy support from self-detonating their acupoints, it would be impossible for them to launch destructive attacks against each other. However, once they self-detonated their acupoints, given their physical condition at the time, there would be no chance of survival. Neither of them would be victorious, and both would ultimately perish. Therefore, they chose another way: to continue the duel tomorrow.\n\nAfter the day's battle, both had gained some understanding of the other's strength, and the danger of tomorrow's battle would significantly increase. Returning to their respective camps, they had already begun to recover with all their might.\n\nNian Bing returned alone to his tent. His complexion had turned pale. Although he had gained the initiative through his intellect today, the excessive consumption had pushed his body to the brink of collapse. While Xi Jie's condition was not much better, this was the first time he had faced such a situation since his strength increased. Nian Bing was confident in his recovery abilities. After all, in a sense, he could be considered a Dragon-human, and his physical resilience was no weaker than Xi Jie's. However, in terms of mental power recovery, it was much easier for him than for Xi Jie. But just as Nian Bing entered the state of special training, preparing to recover himself as quickly as possible, he was horrified to discover a fact, a fact that filled him with terror.\n\nCold sweat trickled down his temples. Recalling the meaningful look in Xi Jie's eyes when they parted, Nian Bing couldn't help but let out a wry smile.\n\nDid Xi Jie truly lack wisdom? A human who had lived for tens of thousands of years, if he truly lacked wisdom, he would not be worthy of being an intelligent being, nor worthy of being the King of the Main Gods.\n\nAs soon as Nian Bing began his cultivation, he realized he was wrong. He had chosen an extremely wrong approach to a very important matter.\n\nIndeed, under normal circumstances, Nian Bing's recovery ability was not inferior to Xi Jie's. However, the situation had changed. As his cultivation began, and his mental power was rapidly recovering, he was horrified to discover that the innate energy in the air was extremely thin, almost non-existent. He immediately remembered his ultimate magic, the Seven Luminaries Awakening. Although this magic was powerful, what it required was to absorb all the innate energy from the air, along with the energy of the Blade Souls and the seven Divine Blades, to generate enough power to contend with Xi Jie.\n\nAt this moment, as he began cultivating, Nian Bing discovered that aside from the fluctuations of elemental power from the seven Divine Blades he had recalled, the magical elements in the air had become extremely scarce, so scarce that it was insufficient to form the innate energy he needed. This discovery was truly terrifying.\n\nWithout innate energy to absorb, how could he recover his strength? In today's battle with Xi Jie, Nian Bing had clearly realized that it was almost impossible to destroy a peerless expert like Xi Jie with physical mental power attacks. At most, he could only affect his condition. Without innate energy, it meant that his seven Blade Souls could not recover their combat strength, and he would not have enough magic power. Although the current situation would still have some impact on Xi Jie, the impact on him would be much less than on Nian Bing. After all, Xi Jie primarily cultivated Battle Qi, which stimulated his own potential and then combined it with innate energy. Although the lack of innate energy had a huge impact on him, it was much smaller compared to Nian Bing. After a night of recovery, the gap between him and Xi Jie would not only reappear but would also widen further. It was even questionable whether he could threaten Xi Jie. His original plan would likely be very difficult to implement. If Xi Jie could maintain most of his combat strength after destroying Nian Bing, even if the God's Curse was resolved by Nian Bing's special method, the Allied Forces of the Yangguang Continent would still find it difficult to gain any advantage against the Gods.\n\nCold sweat poured down. While he was calculating against Xi Jie, had Xi Jie not also been calculating against him? Nian Bing's heart turned cold. He knew he was still too young. He had acted as if nothing was wrong, with a hint of regret, clearly making Nian Bing believe his stratagem had succeeded. However, it was the opponent who had truly succeeded. While Nian Bing was using his wisdom to try to close the gap with the opponent, the opponent was also using his wisdom to further widen the gap between himself and Nian Bing. Under these circumstances, was there still a need to fight tomorrow's battle? The advantage that should have appeared had now turned into an absolute disadvantage.\n\nLooking at his own hands, Nian Bing fell into a brief daze. He didn't know what he should do next to salvage this defeat. He was thinking, but thinking couldn't solve the situation before him!\n\nNian Bing gradually realized. His wisdom had also played a role. Xi Jie's demeanor might not have been an act. At that moment, after that ultimate strike ended, if Nian Bing had chosen to self-detonate his acupoints and perish with Xi Jie, perhaps Xi Jie would have had no recourse. However, he still cherished life. He couldn't bear to part with what he had now, nor with his beloved family, and therefore, without much thought, he had agreed to battle Xi Jie again tomorrow. Now, it was not the time for regret. What resources did he have left?\n\nWhile thinking, Nian Bing quickly thought of his Sphere of Death and Sphere of Life. Even without innate energy, if he could use the energy within these two energy spheres, then there would still be a chance in tomorrow's battle. However, it wasn't easy to mobilize this life energy and death energy. Since his return from the Divine Continent, Nian Bing had attempted to use these two massive energy spheres every time he cultivated. After all, their existence was like a huge treasure to Nian Bing. However, all he could do now was release some of the life aura from the Sphere of Life. Controlling and compressing such dense energy spheres was not something that could be achieved solely by having strong mental power. Therefore, although Nian Bing had been working hard, he had not achieved any results.\n\nTime passed quickly in his thoughts. Half an hour had flown by in the blink of an eye. Nian Bing now had nothing but a wry smile and a trace of despair. He knew that if his original plan failed, even if the Allied Forces of the Yangguang Continent could hold back the Gods, their own losses would still be enormous. It was questionable how many people would be able to return to the Yangguang Continent. Because of his mistake, Nian Bing knew he bore an irremovable responsibility. After much deliberation, he realized that the best solution now was to take advantage of Xi Jie's current state, just like himself, while he was cultivating due to excessive strength depletion, and launch a surprise attack. Although dealing with the Gods would be more difficult without his strength, it was still better than waiting for Xi Jie to recover and then fight. With this thought, Nian Bing stood up resolutely. Even if he had to bear infamy, he would bear it alone. Who else could be blamed for his own mistake? Taking a deep breath, the little mental power he had recovered was enough to support him in carrying out his plan.\n\nNian Bing walked towards the exit. Just as he was about to step out, the tent flap was lifted from the outside. Two familiar, exquisitely beautiful figures appeared before him. Seeing them, Nian Bing's gaze softened considerably, and even his aura became calmer.\n\nIt was Feng Nu and Lan Chen. The expressions of both women were very calm, but their gazes towards Nian Bing held a hint of depth.\n\n\"Nian Bing, where are you going?\" Lan Chen was the one who spoke, and her voice surprisingly carried a hint of allure. Her exquisite figure exuded a more charming charisma in this situation.\n\nUnfortunately, Nian Bing was no longer in the mood to admire his beautiful wife. He let out a wry smile, pulled them back into the tent, lowered his head, and said, \"My calculations were wrong. In tomorrow's battle, I'm afraid I will have no chance. Therefore, I'm going to find Luo Rou and the others to discuss launching an attack on the God army immediately.\"\n\nFeng Nu asked in surprise, \"How can this be? Weren't you already prepared?\"\n\nNian Bing also looked at Feng Nu with some surprise and asked, \"How did you know I was prepared?\"\n\nFeng Nu's gaze immediately became somewhat strange. \"When you returned, you clearly looked confident and assured. But what's wrong with you now?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled bitterly. \"Your observation is too meticulous. Indeed, I was prepared and had a plan. I thought I would have a great chance in tomorrow's battle. But I was still wrong...\" He then briefly explained the situation of scarce magic elements and his judgment to the two women. At this moment, Nian Bing felt the most guilty. He wished he could discuss with his wives to find the best solution.\n\nFeng Nu frowned slightly and sighed, \"Nian Bing, so that's why. According to your assessment, it will be difficult to defeat Xi Jie after a day of recovery, right? In that case, the only option is to attack first, not giving Xi Jie a chance to recover, is that it?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded. \"This is the only method I can think of now. It's the only way. Although betraying a promise is shameful, for the sake of so many lives in the Allied Forces of the Yangguang Continent, I am willing to bear this infamy. Alright, let's not delay. We need to go quickly. As soon as Xi Jie recovers even a little, he will pose a greater threat to us. In the subsequent battle, the remaining two Main Gods will have to be dealt with by you two. As for the other Godly experts, with the Seven Dragon Kings and Brother Daolu, we should still have some advantage. With Luo Rou's intelligence, as long as the God-Slaying Arrow is used well, we definitely have a chance to win.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Nian Bing was about to stand up to find Luo Rou, but two gentle yet icy jade hands were placed on his shoulders.\n\nNian Bing felt a mountain-like aura pressing down from behind him, immediately pinning him in place. Without turning his head, he knew who it was, and he asked strangely, \"Chenchen, what are you doing? Do you have a better plan?\"",

    "content": "Lan Chen changed his grip, pressing down on Nian Bing with one hand. He moved from behind Nian Bing to the front, and together with Feng Nü, he gazed into Nian Bing's eyes and shook his head. \"In this situation, what options do I have? You truly made the biggest mistake, which was underestimating a divine being with ten thousand years of wisdom. In fact, even if you were to attack them now, I suspect the divine beings have already anticipated it. Given Xi Jie's current caution, they will surely be on guard. He likely won't give you many opportunities. Even if the God's Curse can be broken, its resulting harm will still affect the Allied Forces of the Yangguang Continent. In this scenario, the scales of victory will likely not tip in favor of the Allied Forces of the Yangguang Continent. My judgment is not wrong.\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes flashed. Looking at Lan Chen, who wore a seductive smile, his expression suddenly changed drastically. \"You, you're not Chen Chen, who are you?\" Silver light flickered, and without hesitation, he sent a mental shroud towards the Lan Chen in front of him. If he hadn't been concerned about a potential misjudgment, Nian Bing would have used a mental shock. Although his mental power had just recovered a little, it was still usable for attack.\n\nA faint silver light also emanated from Lan Chen's eyes. That gentle silver light did not oppose the mental energy Nian Bing emitted but merely deflected it softly. Nian Bing's body trembled as if electrocuted, and his expression immediately revealed shock. Lan Chen's aura clearly hadn't changed, but her mental power was as vast as an ocean. In this world, who else could reach such a realm? Who possessed such immense mental power? There was only one answer.\n\n\"You, are you Tian Xiang?\" Nian Bing stared at the Lan Chen in front of him. He never expected Dark Tian Xiang to suddenly appear at this time.\n\nLan Chen smiled faintly, and the hand on Nian Bing's shoulder gently squeezed. \"It's good that you still remember me. I thought you had already forgotten me long ago.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned. \"What kind of joke is this? Why are you controlling my wife's body? Where is Kao? If you leave the Divine Continent without permission, aren't you afraid of those three True Gods troubling you? Kao alone definitely won't be able to resist.\"\n\nNian Bing had no idea if Tian Xiang's arrival was good or bad. Although Xi Jie was nothing in front of Tian Xiang, Tian Xiang's arrival might also signify the movement of the three True Gods from the Divine Continent, and those were the powerhouses Nian Bing least wanted to involve himself with. Those three despicable fellows, since they could destroy the civilization of the entire Lost Continent, could also destroy the Yangguang Continent.\n\n\"Thank you for still thinking of me. Am I not here? Just as you said, if Kao and I were to separate, the result would likely be destruction.\" A familiar voice, filled with a touch of gentleness, spoke. The surging life force nourished Nian Bing's body, instantly revitalizing him.\n\nWhen Nian Bing looked back in shock, he saw Feng Nü smiling at him. Although her appearance hadn't changed, her long hair had turned green. Who else could possess such surging and broad life force other than Kao, the God of Life?\n\nNian Bing had to admire the strength of top-tier powerhouses like Kao and Tian Xiang. Not only did they control Feng Nü and Lan Chen's bodies, but they also transferred all their abilities into his wives' bodies without causing any damage. This was an extremely terrifying situation. Although Nian Bing's own mental power was not weak, he was far from reaching that level.\n\nLooking at Kao and then at Tian Xiang, Nian Bing felt a strange sensation and said softly, \"Even if you came to find me, you didn't need to invade my wives' bodies. In doing so, won't you damage their souls?\"\n\nTian Xiang chuckled. \"You really are a sentimental one. Don't worry, we won't damage their souls, at least not at this moment.\"\n\nNian Bing's expression changed. \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\nTian Xiang giggled. \"It doesn't mean anything. Nian Bing, we actually came today to ask for your help. If we weren't forced, we wouldn't have come here to find you. Alas, we have no choice!\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned. Compared to the unpredictable Tian Xiang, he preferred dealing with Kao, the God of Life. Perhaps it was also related to the past romantic encounter he had with Kao in the water. He turned his gaze to Kao, who was controlling Feng Nü's body, and asked, \"What is going on? What trouble have you encountered, and how do you need my help? You should know that with my strength, I pose no threat to those three True Gods.\"\n\nKao sighed. Nian Bing actually saw a hint of sadness in her eyes. \"Nian Bing, Tian Xiang is right. We were truly forced to come to you. If there were any other options, we would never have chosen this. Only by borrowing your strength can we possibly continue to survive.\"\n\nNian Bing was shocked. \"Is it that serious?\"\n\nKao nodded firmly. \"You know a little about the situation of those three True Gods. I told you last time on the Divine Continent that their combined strength is already greater than ours, and they are fully capable of destroying both of us. However, they fear a backlash from our Emotion Gods before they die, killing two of them. Therefore, although they have the upper hand, they have been hesitating. But in recent years, the three of them have been cultivating diligently, and recently, Tian Xiang and I have been having frequent uneasy feelings. You must understand, as Emotion Gods, we are extremely sensitive to emotions and feelings. This feeling can only represent one thing: we are about to face great trouble. Simple deduction and reasoning lead to a simple answer: the God of Order and the other two have likely found a way to deal with us. Because of this, we are now in extreme crisis. Likely in the next couple of days, they will seek us out for a final decisive battle.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at the sadness in Kao's eyes and felt a pang of pity. Although the woman in front of him was many years older than him, Nian Bing saw her as very pitiable. For so many years, Kao and Tian Xiang had been working hard to contend with their opponents. Tens of thousands of years had passed, and the conflict still hadn't disappeared. And now, they were facing the threat of death. Recalling Kao's perfect and flawless delicate body and her moving expression when she drank the Hundred Flower Dew he brewed, Nian Bing almost subconsciously nodded. \"Alright, tell me, how do you need my help? As long as I can do it, I will do my best to help you through this difficult time. I have no good feelings towards those three main gods. If they can be completely destroyed, that would be the best. The entire civilization of the Lost Continent was destroyed by their hands!\"\n\nTian Xiang's smile faded, and she looked at Nian Bing seriously. \"If our plan with Kao is successful with your help this time, I promise you, we will definitely destroy those three fellows completely, to repay your help. At the same time, we will also help your Yangguang Continent completely resolve all issues with the divine beings. This may be the only thing we can do for you.\"\n\nLooking at the flickering light in Tian Xiang's eyes, Nian Bing suddenly felt a sense of unease and asked doubtfully, \"Aren't you pressed for time? Then don't beat around the bush. Tell me quickly how you need my help. However, there is no innate energy here, and my strength is far weaker than normal.\"\n\nTian Xiang shook her head. \"Your help is unrelated to your strength. Do you remember? Kao once told you that we are both unfinished products. When we were born, the Father of Human Evolution, who created us, discovered this problem. However, in order to study us, he was already exhausted. At that time, he seemed to have figured out the problem, but he didn't have time to say it. Before he died, he left only one word. For this word, we have spent tens of thousands of years researching it! It was only because of your appearance last time that we finally understood the meaning of that word. You were right, under certain special circumstances, as long as Kao and my energy are fully fused, and we unravel the mysteries of life energy and death energy, our strength will sublimate into true Emotion Gods, and our power can instantly increase to the eighteenth level, becoming the true strongest. Do you know what that word was that the Father of Human Evolution left you before he died?\"\n\nNian Bing shook his head in confusion and watched Tian Xiang's increasingly excited expression. His unease grew stronger.\n\nKao sighed and interjected, \"That word was 'Yi' (異). At that time, the Father of Human Evolution seemed to have many things to say to us, but his life force was too depleted, and I had only just gained life energy and couldn't save his life. Therefore, before he died, he only uttered this one word. For this word, Tian Xiang and I endured so much hardship. We continuously researched the mysteries represented by this word but achieved nothing.\"\n\nNian Bing frowned. \"If the Father of Human Evolution, whom you respect, had a way to resolve this situation between you, why didn't he leave some records for you before he died? Instead, it turned out like this, and you haven't found that method for tens of thousands of years?\"\n\nTian Xiang snorted impatiently. \"Do you think human evolution is that easy? The Father of Human Evolution, who researched us, and the Father of Technology, who researched those three fellows, the God of Order, both spent their entire lives to achieve something. Before we were truly created, the Father of Human Evolution didn't know that we would have such flaws. After we appeared, his life force had already been greatly weakened. Before he died, perhaps it was the clearest moment of his life. At that moment, Kao and I both saw the enlightened expression in his eyes. We knew that he had figured it out at that time. But it was too late. He didn't have time to express his thoughts, thus allowing us to change our current situation. Tens of thousands of years, a full tens of thousands of years have passed, and he only left us with one word.\"\n\nNian Bing asked curiously, \"So, do you understand now? Your meaning just now seemed to be that under my influence, you have already understood the mystery of that word.\"\n\nKao and Tian Xiang nodded simultaneously. A faint blush appeared on the faces of the two female True Gods. Kao said, \"Yes, we finally understand. What the Father of Human Evolution left us should not have been one word, but a phrase: 'Yi Xing' (異性), not just a simple 'Yi'.\"\n\n\"'Yi Xing'? Can you explain it more clearly?\" Although the feeling of unease still existed, Nian Bing's curiosity was even stronger at this moment. After all, this was a mystery from tens of thousands of years ago!\n\nWith the two female True Gods here, he didn't need to worry about the divine beings for the time being.\n\nKao said, \"I told you last time that life energy and death energy are two almost absolutely opposite energies, and Tian Xiang and I are the contradictory combination of these two opposite energies. At that time, you said that your ice and fire dual-element magic could be fused under special circumstances. For this statement of yours, Tian Xiang and I have considered it for a long time. You also studied it with us, and the results proved that your theory is absolutely valid. Your ice and fire dual-element magic utilizes the fixed characteristics of magic elements, changing their coexistence characteristics, allowing them to preserve their original abilities while adapting to each other, thus making you an ice and fire dual-element magician. However, our life energy and death energy are on a much higher level than your ice and fire dual-element magic, making it too difficult for these two energies to fuse. But the special circumstances you mentioned still exist. After careful consideration by Tian Xiang and me, and everything that has happened between us and the final word 'Yi' left by the Father God, we have finally figured it out. And we are also fortunate that we have already made all the preparations. Now, we have at least a fifty percent chance of success, becoming true Emotion Gods, but this requires your help.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Kao and Tian Xiang in surprise and disbelief. \"Kao, are you saying that you have found the common ground between life energy and death energy? This, this is too incredible. How did you do it?\"",

    "content": "He of course knew to what levels Life Energy and Death Energy had reached. Merely possessing one of them had brought Kao and Tian Xiang to the seventeenth tier. If he didn’t account for his other strengths, he himself, possessing the ice-fire dual source, was at most at the thirteenth tier. The gap in tiers was simply too vast. Precisely because of this gap, fusing Life Energy and Death Energy became a hundred times more difficult than fusing ice and fire. Therefore, upon hearing Kao and Tian Xiang say they had found a method, Nian Bing was filled with doubt and curiosity.\n\nKao’s face turned even redder as he nodded slightly and said, “Yes, we did find it. Although Life Energy and Death Energy encompass almost all energies, there is one that they cannot contain. As Gods of Emotion, we are very clear that emotions are a form of energy. And within emotions, there is only one that is completely unaffected by life and death: love. You have several wives; I believe you understand the power of love. In the face of true love, life and death can be ignored. Precisely because of this, we believe that in the power of love, all energies are compatible, even Life and Death energies. Simply put, love is the common point between the two completely opposite energies of life and death.”\n\nNian Bing looked at Kao and Tian Xiang in astonishment. He never expected the answer to be this. Love, the common point between life and death, was love. He looked at Kao and Tian Xiang in shock, suddenly understanding something. The light in his eyes dimmed. \"Tell me honestly, did you begin to plot against me from the moment you first met me?\"\n\nTian Xiang said calmly, \"You could think of it that way. At that time, we had already considered the possibility of the opposite sex. But we had not yet confirmed that love was this important common point. We thought it was human emotions, so Kao had you go to the Mountain of Death to find me. Through the utilization of various circumstances, we gradually understood the secret.\"\n\nNian Bing's gaze sharpened. \"Then, that means your injury from my mental power attack on the Mountain of Death was also faked?\"\n\nTian Xiang looked deeply at Nian Bing. \"Your mental power is indeed far stronger than we imagined. I was indeed startled at the time. But as for being injured, that's impossible. After all, the gap between you and us is still too great. It was precisely at that time that we decided to choose you as the candidate for the fusion of the Gods of Emotion. You possess rich emotions. At that time, your kiss allowed us to fully experience the taste of human love, even though you didn't have love then. To be honest, even the intimacy that happened between you and Kao when he was restoring your life force was intentionally provoked by us to experience the power of love. Your willpower is extremely firm. If we hadn't used some special methods later, that kind of relationship wouldn't have happened between you and Kao, or rather, between you and us.”\n\nNo wonder, no wonder he had been so impulsive in the Lake of Life, feeling so strongly. It turned out he had fallen into the trap of the Gods of Life and Death long ago. Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a bit of sadness. He had always considered himself very smart, but compared to these beings who had lived for tens of thousands of years, he was nothing.\n\nKao's sadness became even more apparent. \"That time, I truly tasted love. Even now, I can clearly remember every moment that happened. Tian Xiang and I are one body with dual souls; whatever I can feel, she can feel as well. Through our continuous research and exploration, we finally found love as the common point between life and death. Therefore, we came here at a moment of crisis. Originally, neither Tian Xiang nor I wanted to harm you. After all, you are the only man who made us feel the taste of love. But we had no choice. If we cannot become true Gods of Emotion, then our end will only be death. For the great wish of the Father of Human Evolution, for our battles over tens of thousands of years, sacrifices must be made. Nian Bing, I apologize, but we must use your body to complete this fusion process.”\n\nNian Bing looked at Kao calmly. \"I understand. The so-called breaking down and then building up… your so-called fusion is probably centered around me, right? After you complete the fusion of the Gods of Emotion, as the medium for the fusion, I will naturally perish along with it, which is why you feel somewhat troubled. Since you have made up your minds to come find me this time, then there is nothing more for me to say. In front of two true gods, I have no ability to resist at all.”\n\nAfter saying this, he chuckled self-mockingly. He had originally considered Kao and Tian Xiang as his friends, and because of the past relationship with Kao, he had always had some strange feelings in his heart. But he now understood that he had always been merely a tool used by Kao and Tian Xiang. They helped him restore his life force and improve his strength, much like fattening a pig before slaughtering it. They came to find him only for the harvest.\n\nLooking at Nian Bing’s indifferent eyes, Kao and Tian Xiang both felt a pang of pain for no reason. The two women lowered their heads simultaneously. Tian Xiang said, \"Nian Bing, if we had a choice, we wouldn't want it to be this way. We apologize.”\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"It's alright. Since you have already decided, I can't change anything. Even if I had known you were using me back then, I would have had no way to change this fact. After all, I was already in a semi-dead state then. My life was given by you, and now you want it back, can I refuse? I don't have the strength to refuse. However, considering the brief encounter we had, I would like to ask you a few things. If you agree, I will fully cooperate with you to complete the fusion process. I believe my cooperation as a medium would be somewhat helpful to you, wouldn't it?”\n\n“A brief encounter? Nian Bing, your words are so harsh.” Kao raised her head, her eyes filled with complexity as she looked at Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing smiled freely. \"I really can't think of any other way to describe it. Perhaps this is the best explanation. Isn't our relationship a brief encounter? There's no need to argue about this anymore. I just want to know if you are willing to agree to a few things for me?”\n\nKao took a deep breath and walked to Nian Bing's side, placing her hand on his other shoulder. \"Tell me. As long as we can do it, we will try our best to help you accomplish it.”\n\nNian Bing looked deeply at Kao. His meaningful gaze seemed to pierce into Kao's heart. \"Actually, the things I want to ask you to do are extremely simple for you. First, you said that after completing the fusion of the Gods of Emotion and dealing with those three true gods, you can help our allied forces on the Yangguang Continent resolve the threat of the god-men. I hope you will fulfill this promise. After all, this world can no longer withstand the cost of another great war of god remnants. If another civilization is destroyed, it will probably take hundreds of thousands of years to recover. I believe your earlier words about wanting to live a normal life were true. For your own future, please complete this matter.”\n\nKao and Tian Xiang nodded simultaneously. Kao said, \"Don't worry. Those god-men should not exist in this world. Let me tell you a secret: the god-men were deliberately cultivated by those three fellows of the God of Order, with the intention of selecting the strongest among humanity to assist them. It's just that human advancement has been too slow, and it is full of various dangers and uncertainties. Human nature itself is difficult to grasp, which is why they failed. We will naturally deal with these god-men who should not exist. Nian Bing, we promise to help you with this after we eliminate those three true gods. Do you have any other wishes?”\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath. \"My death may have some impact on the Yangguang Continent. My second wish is for you to replace me in balancing the relationships between the various empires on the Yangguang Continent. I hate war; only peace is the most beautiful thing in the world. I believe that with your strength, you can do it better than I can.”\n\nTian Xiang frowned slightly. \"This matter, although a bit troublesome, we can also agree to it. With our power, balancing relationships only requires some means and forceful pressure. It might be a bit troublesome, though.”\n\nNian Bing smiled faintly. \"For you, handling such troubles seems to be a very simple matter. My third wish is even simpler. After I die, please erase the memories of me from my three wives' hearts. Perhaps this is impossible for others, but with your ultimate energies of Life and Death, combined with the vast mental power of the awakened Gods of Emotion, this task should not be difficult. I don't want my wives to grieve excessively over my death, or even do anything foolish. I just want them to live new lives. Even if they forget me, they will regain new life. As long as they can be happy, I will have no regrets. As for my parents, please help guide them. Perhaps, with your control over emotions as Gods of Emotion, you can reduce their grief. You can find a way to tell them that I died from severe injuries after expending too much energy in a battle with the Xijie. These are my only three conditions.”\n\nKao looked at Nian Bing and sighed. \"Perhaps this is true human love. To be willing to be forgotten for the happiness of the one you love. Nian Bing, your love makes me truly envious. Your wives are so fortunate!”\n\nTian Xiang added, \"Unfortunately, we cannot agree to this last condition. It is easy to handle your parents. Your death will cause them grief, but we are confident in controlling their emotions and helping them gradually recover. However, among your three wives, only that girl named Long Ling can have her memories erased. Feng Nü and Lan Chen, this pair of sisters, cannot.”\n\nNian Bing's heart trembled, and his expression could no longer remain calm. He exclaimed in shock, \"Is one medium not enough? You, you wouldn't hurt my wives, would you?”\n\nKao said sadly, \"As beings who have lived for tens of thousands of years, we do not do things without purpose. Since we have occupied your wives' bodies, we naturally have our reasons. Tian Xiang and I are both energy bodies. Even if we can feel your true love, it is difficult to achieve the fusion of Gods of Emotion without physical intimacy and love exchange with you. During the fusion process, we must borrow the bodies of your two wives. Frankly, your conditions are exceptionally excellent, much better than we imagined. You are an ice-fire dual-source mage. Although your current strength can be manifested in many ways, this point will not change. And your two wives are noble and powerful beings – Phoenixes, one ice and one fire. They perfectly match your body. The reason why your strength has improved so quickly is largely due to the exchange of ice and fire energies between you. Our Life and Death energies are too overbearing and can easily cause damage to your body in the early stages of fusion, leading to complete failure. However, if we use your two wives' bodies as conduits, this danger will not exist, and our chances of success will be much higher. Moreover, this will allow Tian Xiang and my two souls to be separated by attaching to different physical bodies. Only then do we have a chance of success. Therefore, your wives cannot simply have their memories erased and live again.”\n\nNian Bing's heart pounded violently. Looking at Kao and Tian Xiang who had invaded the bodies of Feng Nü and Lan Chen, a great storm raged within his heart. He could disregard his own life; after all, his life had been saved from the brink of death several times. However, he could not disregard the lives of his wives! He absolutely did not want his beloved women to suffer the slightest harm.\n\nTian Xiang sighed softly. \"Nian Bing, we could have agreed to your request earlier. After all, you would already be dead by then, your soul disappearing and no longer able to perceive anything in the outside world. However, we don't want to lie to you at this moment, which is why we are telling you the truth. What we need to do is control the bodies of your two concubines and merge with you. In this way, the love in their souls will blend with yours, and the love we have for you will be ignited, and the Life and Death energies will gradually fuse within your ice-fire fusion, allowing us to become true Gods of Emotion.”",

    "content": "Nian Bing’s voice rose, “Then, after this ritual ends, what will happen to Chenchen and Feng Nu?”\n\nKao sighed, “Perhaps, their souls will also disappear with you. We haven’t experienced this fusion process ourselves, so we don’t know what will truly happen then. Your mental power and magic will become the medium for our fusion, and will inevitably disappear. As for me and Tianxiang, after becoming the God of Emotions, we will continue to use the bodies of Feng Nu and Lan Chen, becoming the new them. Perhaps, in a certain sense, you can understand that they haven't truly died; they have indeed gained new life.”\n\n“Nonsense! If their souls are gone, how can they still be Feng Nu and Chenchen? You, you are too despicable! Is there no other way? I can die, I can cooperate with you, but I beg you, don’t harm my wives.”\n\nTianxiang shook her head, “I’m sorry, Nian Bing. Although Kao and I have developed affection for you due to the fleeting encounters you mentioned, our love for you is far less profound than that of your wives. In this situation, we must utilize their bodies. Moreover, when we truly become the God of Emotions, we will have to separate. Perfect bodies like those of your two wives are extremely rare in this world. Therefore, when we came here, we had already decided to do this. You don’t need to say any more. Since things are destined, they cannot be changed.”\n\nNian Bing looked at them, his eyes full of hatred, “Now I finally understand. So, all you true gods are birds of a feather. Compared to those three fellows of the God of Order, you are not much better. Kao, Tianxiang, if you are truly going to do this, then don’t blame me for doing my utmost to disrupt your plans. Death is death, even if I die, I won’t let you have your way.”\n\nTianxiang said calmly, “Nian Bing, you still underestimate us. Although we can only fuse into a half God of Emotions now, it is enough for you. By controlling your emotions, we can make you do many things. Furthermore, standing before you are your two wives. Merely your feelings for them, when provoked by our abilities, have the potential to explode. Therefore, even if you don’t cooperate with us, we can still complete the fusion process. We are telling you this only to make you understand all the facts. We also don’t want to do this, but we truly have no other choice. For survival, who can say what is right and what is wrong? Perhaps you will hate us forever until the moment your soul disappears, but we can no longer change our minds. We are sorry, Nian Bing. What we can still promise you is not to harm that little dragon within you. We will also fulfill the conditions we previously agreed upon.”\n\nNian Bing fully activated his mental power, but he clearly felt the hands on his shoulders suddenly tighten. The life and death energy orbs in his chest emitted diametrically opposite energies simultaneously. His entire body froze, and all his abilities were instantly sealed. Apart from being able to speak, he could do nothing else.\n\nTwo tears slid from Kao’s eyes, “Nian Bing, I’m sorry. I will always remember your Hundred Flower Dew. You are the first man in my life, and the last. Even if I become the God of Emotions, this fact can never change. Although you are not a perfect human, you possess a devoted heart. Nian Bing, we are going to begin. Soon, this will all be over. You won’t feel any pain; your soul will disappear at the peak of bliss.”\n\nTianxiang said, “Actually, I truly envy you three. When you pleaded with us to spare Feng Nu and Lan Chen, their souls were also pleading with us, offering their lives in exchange for yours. Unfortunately, all of this has become impossible.”\n\nNian Bing smiled, his smile so desolate, “Is it heaven’s will that we, husband and wife, must live and die together? If that is truly the case, what can I do? Kao, Tianxiang, do you know what I’m thinking right now? Before, I truly hated those three fellows of the God of Order, but now I really wish they would appear immediately. You left the Divine Continent; I don’t believe they would have no reaction. As their greatest rivals, your every move is likely being monitored by them, right?”\n\nAt this critical juncture, Nian Bing looked at the resolute determination in the sad eyes of Kao and Tianxiang and understood that they could no longer be moved by emotion. Now, to survive, he could only rely on his own intelligence. Although the possibility of success was infinitely close to zero, for his wives, he had to try. However, Kao’s reply immediately plunged him into despair.\n\n“Nian Bing, since we came to find you, everything has been arranged. You don’t need to say anything more; it will only make our impression of you worse. When we left the Divine Continent, Tianxiang and I used the energies of life and death to condense our true forms. Relying on their energy signatures, it will be difficult for those three to sense us. Moreover, they are likely at a critical juncture in their seclusion. Even if they sense us, they will only come after us after completing their cultivation. This time is enough for us to complete the fusion process today. Nian Bing, I’m sorry.”\n\nCold black energy flowed from Tianxiang’s hand, sweeping over every part of Nian Bing’s body. Kao released her hands and stood aside, watching Nian Bing, tears constantly falling from her eyes. Tianxiang and Kao were originally one, and their feelings were similar. It was just that Tianxiang’s personality was clearly stronger than Kao’s.\n\nUnder the effect of the cold black energy, Nian Bing felt a chilling sensation throughout his body. His mage robe turned to dust and disappeared, revealing his tall and powerful physique. Being unclothed in front of his wives was not an issue, but now, it was equivalent to four women looking at him. Nian Bing was filled with hatred, but in front of true gods, he was powerless.\n\nThe black energy disappeared. Kao and Tianxiang simultaneously walked in front of Nian Bing. Externally, they appeared as Feng Nu and Lan Chen, but their expressions belonged to Kao and Tianxiang. The two soft and supple bodies pressed against Nian Bing. Nian Bing only felt the space before him change, and the next moment, he was lying flat on the bed.\n\nFaint lights emanated from Kao and Tianxiang respectively. Through the influence of the life and death orbs, Nian Bing could clearly hear their gradually accelerating heartbeats. That strange sensation made Nian Bing’s heart tighten. He knew the fusion process was about to begin.\n\nFeng Nu and Lan Chen were not wearing clothes to begin with. Ever since they reached the eighth transformation of the Phoenix, they could condense the most beautiful clothes on their bodies using energy without expending too much. This was a racial ability of the Phoenix tribe. Phoenixes had brilliant feathers, and the clothes on their bodies were like phoenix feathers.\n\nWith faint lights and shadows, the blue and red long dresses floated away and disappeared. The scorching and chilling bodies pressed against Nian Bing’s chest. Kao and Tianxiang also appeared nervous. They even paused for a moment, unsure of what to do.\n\nNian Bing recalled a saying circulating on the continent: When a woman is being raped, if she knows resistance is futile, she might as well choose to enjoy it. Even if it's just the final enjoyment, it's still more worthwhile than losing her life in futile resistance. At least, by preserving her life, there's still a chance for revenge. But he, now, was not even like a woman. Perhaps, he could also choose to enjoy it, after all, whether his two wives or Kao and Tianxiang, they were all top-tier women. However, after this enjoyment, his life would also be lost.\n\nA scorching sensation spread from his lower abdomen. Nian Bing was genuinely impressed with himself; when his life was threatened, his body still produced intense pleasure under the friction of the perfect bodies of Feng Nu and Lan Chen.\n\nKao and Tianxiang’s hands were clasped at some point. A faint pink mist enveloped the entire room. This domain, without any powerful feeling, instantly brought a strange sensation to the tent, as if everything had become sharp, yet everything had also become blurry, as if this was no longer the original tent, but another space.\n\nKao’s voice echoed in Nian Bing’s mind, “We are going to begin. Although our Emotion Domain is only a semi-finished product of a half God of Emotions, it is enough for you. Do not try to resist; it will only make you feel more pain. Pass on peacefully. If possible, we will try to preserve the souls of Feng Nu and Lan Chen and transplant them into suitable bodies later. Once we become true Gods of Emotions, we will have this ability.”\n\nOnly after hearing Kao finish her sentence did Nian Bing truly feel that the sadness Kao had been exuding was genuine. She had indeed developed affection for him. Although he didn’t know how deep this affection was, it was ultimately real.\n\n“Thank you, Kao. Although you haven’t given me a clear answer, perhaps this is the best news for me now. I will not resist. For my wives to survive, I will cooperate with you as much as possible to complete the fusion process. To be able to love my wives again before I die, perhaps, compared to other dying people, I am the happiest one. With his mood finally stabilizing, Nian Bing realized his senses had become even more acute. Having thought everything through, his heart had become much more at ease. Only by better assisting the fusion of the Gods of Emotions could Feng Nu and Lan Chen’s souls possibly be minimally affected by the perfect fusion, thus surviving. For Nian Bing, this was undoubtedly the happiest thing. Therefore, he no longer chose to resist but chose to cooperate. Closing his eyes, he didn't want to think about anything else, only to feel every subtle change in his wives’ bodies. In his consciousness, Kao and Tianxiang no longer existed. Although Feng Nu and Lan Chen only had their bodies, the love in Nian Bing’s heart continued to be released. Nian Bing knew this was his last chance to express his love for them. He held nothing back, releasing the love in his heart for them without any other emotions present. Although Nian Bing’s body couldn’t move, every inch of him was filled with waves of love.\n\nAs Kao and Tianxiang’s semi-emotion domain was completed, they were suddenly surprised to find that their domain had no effect at all. Their objective was to provoke the love and lust within Nian Bing, but they were now surprised to find that the intense love Nian Bing emanated was actually far stronger than the influence their semi-emotion domain could produce. What was going on? Could a person’s love reach such a level? At this moment, due to the excessive increase in love, Nian Bing’s consciousness was no longer lucid.\n\nThe restrictions were instantly lifted, and Nian Bing regained his ability to move. He opened his arms and hugged his two wives tightly. Let alone the fact that he had long since become lucid when fully releasing the love in his heart, even if he were lucid, he would have no chance against two true gods.\n\nIn Nian Bing’s embrace, Kao and Tianxiang simultaneously felt an incredibly surging love crashing into the deepest parts of their souls in a torrent of warmth, evoking memories of the past. The two true gods’ spirits simultaneously tensed. At this critical moment, as half Gods of Emotions, their consciousness was very clear. They knew that the fusion process was about to begin. This would be their last hope of defeating the other three true gods. With caution, they allowed Nian Bing to gently caress the bodies of Feng Nu and Lan Chen, completely retracting their life and death energies, fully experiencing the emotions sublimated in love. Only when their emotions reached a critical point, when the realm of love was elevated to its extreme, surpassing life and death, could the true fusion of the Gods of Emotions begin.\n\nNian Bing had forgotten everything at this point. He was completely intoxicated by the love in his heart. At what was possibly his last supper, even he was somewhat surprised at how strong the surging love within him was. His heart was filled with the figures of Feng Nu and Lan Chen, and also Long Ling. All his love for them was constantly generated. Love, indeed, was an energy. It not only had an emotional impact but, under the effect of Nian Bing’s gradually released immense love, the bodies of Feng Nu and Lan Chen gradually responded.",

    "content": "The tender skin of the two women gradually showed a layer of alluring rose-red. Feng Nü's delicate body grew hotter, and Lan Chen's delicate body also gradually became fiery. Kao and Tian Xiang strangely discovered that although they now controlled the bodies of the sisters Feng Nü and Lan Chen, a powerful stream of love continuously emanated from their sealed souls. Even with their True God-level strength, they were unable to seal this outflow of love. This love gradually merged with Nian Bing's, and in the constant entanglement, it was sublimated.\n\nNian Bing closed his eyes, using his heart to feel his wives' love. He knew, of course, that it did not come from Kao and Tian Xiang. The two True Gods in his consciousness no longer existed. The intense love, as it continued to sublimate, caused Nian Bing's movements to gradually become more vigorous.\n\nWhile sexual union was indeed wonderful, at this moment, the aura of true love emanating caused them to enter an unprecedented realm. Nian Bing gradually forgot what he was doing, closed his eyes, and completely surrendered his body to instinct, continuously releasing his love. Shark Hands typed, communicating with his two wives through silent love.\n\nKao and Tian Xiang gradually became excited. Under the terrifying power of love, the life and death energies they possessed began to mutate. Their originally distinct domains started to merge. Nian Bing's body was their medium for this merger. The Life Orb and Death Orb on Nian Bing's chest emitted faint black and green glows. The life aura and death aura transformed from repulsion to distinct separation, without interference.\n\nNian Bing's blood seemed to have ignited, boiling intensely. Although Nian Bing, Feng Nü, and Lan Chen could not fully feel the changes in their bodies, completely immersed in the feeling of love, Kao and Tian Xiang, who maintained clarity, endured wave after wave of intense pleasure. Occupying Feng Nü and Lan Chen's bodies, they could naturally feel the process of love sublimation and the ultimate joy of carnal pleasure through their bodies. As gods of emotion, they knew they absolutely could not indulge in lust. However, Nian Bing's body was like a magnet with immense energy, continuously attracting their souls. Every thrust of his was so powerful and concise, without excessive flourish, carrying intense love, continuously ascending with the strong stimulation generated in the semi-emotional realm.\n\nIf Kao and Tian Xiang were not in a state of intense cultivation, they would likely have forced a wry smile. This was because they found that the semi-emotional realm they created together seemed to be used on themselves rather than on Nian Bing.\n\nTheir entwined bodies emitted a carnal aura. In Kao and Tian Xiang's view, Nian Bing was simply tireless. Furthermore, the vast love brought by each of his thrusts not only communicated with Feng Nü and Lan Chen but also continuously impacted Kao and Tian Xiang's souls.\n\nFeng Nü and Lan Chen's souls communicated completely with Nian Bing through the solid bridge of love. Nourished by Nian Bing's love, their souls grew strong. Their souls were sealed, but their love in their hearts could not be sealed. Every increase in their ultimate love made their hearts more aligned with Nian Bing's. Both Lan Chen and Feng Nü were willing to sacrifice everything for the person they loved. Their love, in their entanglement, entered Nian Bing's body, tightly protecting Nian Bing's soul. Although it was merely natural protection born from deep love, they were facing the powerful existences of Kao and Tian Xiang.\n\nKao and Tian Xiang wanted to interrupt the connection between Nian Bing and Feng Nü and Lan Chen more than once. This was because the rate at which their love escalated was too terrifying, causing the impact of love on these two True Gods to become increasingly intense. However, they dared not take that risk. After all, in the continuously rising love, the distinct auras of life and death energies were becoming fainter, seemingly attracted by the invisible love energy. Each pull of vital energy made Kao and Tian Xiang feel closer to each other, and their emotional feelings became more genuine. Even the pink semi-emotional realm, under the effect of the escalating love, caused the fusion process of life and death energies to become more rapid. Clearly, their judgment was absolutely correct. Under the influence of love, a special energy not bound by either life or death energy, life energy and death energy were continuously merging. It could also be said that the gods of emotion were undergoing a continuous fusion process. Every bit of elevated love would make this fusion process faster and more perfect.\n\nNian Bing's life essence was never released. In deep love, each of his thrusts carried his love into the deepest parts of Feng Nü and Lan Chen's souls, which were completely open to him. Each thrust also deeply impacted Kao and Tian Xiang's souls with his love.\n\nKao and Tian Xiang underwent changes almost simultaneously. The intense pleasure and the impact of love energy caused the love they already felt for Nian Bing to begin to sublimate. At first, they were deliberately resisting, but Kao and Tian Xiang soon discovered that Nian Bing's love was not hostile; it was merely love energy unconsciously released. Under the nourishment of his love energy, what they could perceive was endless pleasure, not influence or pain. When their love connected with Nian Bing's love, these two True Gods finally understood why their abilities could not seal Feng Nü and Lan Chen's love for Nian Bing.\n\nIt was absolutely the most wonderful feeling in the world. Through communication bridged by love, everything seemed to become unimportant. That wonderful feeling caused the bodies of Feng Nü and Lan Chen, which they controlled, to simultaneously emit moving moans. It was so beautiful. What surprised Kao and Tian Xiang even more was that although their love was connected to Nian Bing's love, it did not affect their clear state; instead, they became increasingly clear, and their grasp of life and death energies became more precise. After they stopped blocking the impact of Nian Bing's love energy, the fusion process of life and death energies became several times faster than before. It was precisely in this situation that they simultaneously decided to completely open their love to Nian Bing.\n\nThis was a special communication, a silent communication, yet the most wonderful communication in the world.\n\nThe combination of lust and love gradually became unbalanced. Lust became a simple medium and was no longer important, while the communication of love in each other's hearts was even more wonderfully moving.\n\nNian Bing's love energy seemed to be continuously increasing without end, as if there were no limits. Gradually, Kao and Tian Xiang's love for Nian Bing seemed so small in the face of his profound love. Yet, it continued to sublimate within his profound love. In their minds, every moment they had spent with Nian Bing recalled, and every scene became exceptionally clear. They increasingly realized how perfect Nian Bing was, not absolutely perfect, but even his flaws, under the enveloping dense love energy field, strangely ceased to be flaws.\n\nA deep sadness simultaneously appeared in Kao and Tian Xiang's hearts. They both realized their mistake; it was not a mistake in the fusion of the gods of emotion. Now, the life energy and death energy had begun to merge seamlessly with slight contact. Clearly, true fusion had begun. What made Kao and Tian Xiang feel sad was precisely because of Nian Bing's love. As they felt the wonder from the deepest part of their souls in that dense love, they simultaneously thought of a problem. Nian Bing's love did not arise because of them; Nian Bing's intense love was directed towards his own wives!\n\nAt this time, although Kao and Tian Xiang wanted to suppress the sadness in their hearts, in that incredibly wonderful feeling, they were horrified to discover that as gods of semi-emotion, they could not control their feelings at all. Their minds were completely filled with Nian Bing's love for his wives, and the despicable feelings they used from Nian Bing. Their love for Nian Bing continued to sublimate, but the higher this love sublimated, the deeper their sorrow became.\n\nKao and Tian Xiang suddenly understood a problem. They were both terrified to discover that if this continued, even if the life energy and death energy fused completely under their control, under the influence of love energy that had risen to a higher level than these two energies, their lives would end due to endless sorrow. As gods of emotion, they all understood how much power could be generated when an emotion reached its extreme. The pinnacle of love could help them become true gods of emotion, but the pinnacle of sorrow could completely destroy them!\n\nKao and Tian Xiang did not understand where they had gone wrong, but they knew that they had already walked into the abyss of destruction. At this time, their emotions were completely out of control. Although they had the ability to leave Nian Bing's embrace and end this fusion process, if they did so, Nian Bing would die immediately due to the pull of life energy and death energy, and their love, which had now sublimated to a level close to Feng Nü and Lan Chen, would not allow them to do so. If they truly did so, they would also be destroyed by the extreme sorrow in their hearts.\n\nAt this moment, Kao and Tian Xiang found themselves in a predicament where they could neither stop nor continue. They could only watch everything unfold, enduring extreme pleasure while simultaneously enduring endless sorrow. In this icy-hot dual experience, their pain was imaginable. And only they could feel all of this. They became exceptionally clear, knowing that when life energy and death energy completely fused into true god of emotion energy, a true god of emotion would not be born. This was because, at that time, Nian Bing's soul would disappear in complete release due to their invasion and absorption, and they would also be destroyed by the peak sorrow caused by Nian Bing's death. This fusion had no winner; it could be considered a complete failure.\n\nNian Bing's body continued to perform the most intimate contact with Feng Nü and Lan Chen alternately according to instinct, and his love had completely lost his mind. Kao and Tian Xiang were clearly aware of everything happening around them, but he was completely unaware. There was only one thing he wanted to do: before he was destroyed, he wanted to dedicate all the love in his heart to his beloved wives. This goal was very simple, and this was why his love could be released without reservation.\n\nKao and Tian Xiang's hearts underwent complex changes. Extreme pleasure sent them to peaks again and again, and life energy and death energy also became more intimately merged in the process of continuous fusion. The Death Orb on Nian Bing's chest had struggled out of the Dazhong acupoint and merged with the Life Orb. If it weren't for the special change of sorrowful emotions arising in their hearts, this fusion would have been absolutely perfect.\n\nHowever, in Kao and Tian Xiang's view, these seemed no longer important. Even the most important thing in their lives, destroying the other three True Gods, seemed to have become illusory. Yes, in the face of such immense love energy, what could replace the feelings in their hearts? In their lives, only one figure remained: Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing's love energy release rate increased again, but his thrusting body gradually slowed down. Kao and Tian Xiang's hearts tightened simultaneously because they both knew that Nian Bing's final thrust was imminent, and his life essence would be released at that moment. The moment his life essence was released would also be the moment the god of emotion energy completely fused. However, a true god of emotion could only appear for a fleeting moment.\n\nKao and Tian Xiang's spirits were on the verge of collapse from sorrow and pleasure. They were both enduring with all their might. Suddenly, Feng Nü and Lan Chen, whom they controlled, trembled violently. Nian Bing's love energy suddenly erupted like a volcanic explosion. In reality, he let out a low roar, and his thrusts instantly became more vigorous.\n\nAt this moment, Nian Bing was united with Feng Nü, and Lan Chen clung tightly to his back. The three of them were completely enveloped in dense love energy. The final moment had finally arrived. This would be the ultimate manifestation of love, and at the same time, the end of destruction.",

    "content": "Kao and Tianxiang felt Nianbing's suddenly surging love. Their love for Nianbing reached a whole new level in their hearts. In that very instant, a profound realization dawned in the depths of their hearts. They simultaneously understood where they had gone wrong and what the true meaning of love and the true God of Love were.\n\nIn that moment, the sorrow in Kao and Tianxiang's hearts vanished completely. As the immense pain disappeared, it was replaced by an incomparably surging pleasure, the peak of ecstasy.\n\nFeng Nu and Lan Chen both shed tears of truth, but these tears were no longer their own; they belonged to Kao, the God of Life, and Tianxiang, the God of Death.\n\nThe end of the fusion finally arrived. With a louder low growl, Nianbing finally unleashed the most essential part of his life. The entire tent was instantly filled with a red aura. Gradually, the red aura transformed into a faint purple light—a noble light like a violet. The purple deepened, and Nianbing's love, along with his consciousness, was completely absorbed. Along with them, Kao and Tianxiang's consciousnesses also vanished. The tent was now filled with only a faint purple light, emanating a noble and special scent with every tremor.\n\n...\n\nXialu was teaching his subordinate dwarves some special martial arts techniques usable only by dwarves. He was somewhat absent-minded today because he knew how perilous tomorrow's battle would be. With his nearly fourteenth-rank strength, he could clearly see that although Nianbing's overall combat power was strong, he was still no match for Xi Jie. Today's draw had already surprised him immensely, but he had no idea what kind of combat effectiveness Nianbing could display in tomorrow's battle.\n\nSuddenly, Xialu felt a violent fluctuation in his spiritual power. A strong premonition flashed in his eyes, emitting an unusually powerful light. His gaze instinctively turned towards Nianbing's tent in the distance. Although his spiritual power was not very strong, he could still perform simple observations. However, he found that Nianbing's tent was filled with an aura of deathly silence, as if no life existed within.\n\nXialu began to feel a sense of panic. He knew how powerful Nianbing's life energy was now. The disappearance of his life energy could only mean one thing: the end of life! Could it be that Nianbing had already suffered an incurable injury in yesterday's battle with Xi Jie?\n\nThe first rays of dawn slowly rose from the east, and the sun gradually brought new light to the earth. However, Xialu's heart was filled with ice. Nianbing's death meant not only the loss of the strongest person standing against the enemy but also the loss of his closest brother and best companion! Xialu let out a roar without any warning, causing his newly accepted tribesmen to fall to the ground. With a flash, he was already rushing towards Nianbing's tent.\n\nXialu was not the only one who felt Nianbing's life energy disappear. At the same time, Nianbing's closest people also felt it. The first among them was Maomao. Apart from Nianbing, among the Allied Forces of the Yangguang Continent, her spiritual power was the strongest. Therefore, when Nianbing's life aura ceased, she was the first to sense it and rushed towards Nianbing's tent immediately. When she arrived at Nianbing's tent, she happened to encounter the rapidly approaching Xialu. Shortly after, Nianbing's parents and the Seven Dragon Kings arrived almost simultaneously, their eyes filled with horror and disbelief, but not sorrow, as they were all stunned into a state of shock.\n\nJust as everyone was preparing to break into the tent, a peculiar energy fluctuation suddenly emanated from within. The energy fluctuation was very gentle, soothing away all the negative emotions in everyone's hearts. Even the usually impulsive Xialu forcibly stopped himself from charging into the tent. A gentle and joyous emotion spread through everyone outside the tent. The energy, though not strong, calmed their hearts.\n\nNianbing's slightly weary voice came from the tent, \"Thank you all for your concern. I'm fine. Or rather, I've made some breakthroughs in certain aspects. It was just a brief pause in energy. Please order Luo Rou to prepare the troops. Later, I will go out for the final duel with Xi Jie.\"\n\nNianbing's voice dispelled all the doubts in everyone's hearts. The emotions conveyed in his voice made everyone understand that it was just a false alarm. Under the direction of Bingling, everyone gradually dispersed. They all knew the price Nianbing paid in yesterday's battle, and even letting him rest for another minute would be good.\n\nCalm returned to the area around Nianbing's tent, while Nianbing himself was sitting inside the tent.\n\nCompletely naked, he stared blankly at his two wives, who were intertwined with his body and emitting a faint fragrance. Their breathing was steady, and their full chests rose and fell slightly with each breath.\n\n\"Am I dreaming? Was all of that just a dream?\" Nianbing muttered to himself. He had fallen into a brief coma, and it felt like a century before he woke up. In reality, his coma lasted only an instant.\n\n\"No, this isn't a dream!\" Nianbing quickly came to his senses, his consciousness becoming clearer and clearer. If this were a dream, what would Feng Nu and Lan Chen say? However, if everything were real, as Kao and Tianxiang had said, he should have died by now. So why was he here, so clear-headed and real? Nianbing didn't understand. His heart was filled with confusion, but when he subconsciously checked the energy within his body, he was startled.\n\nWith a thought, Nianbing felt no change in his spiritual power. Everything within his body was presented in his mind. All the energy in his body had disappeared. It wasn't the weakness he felt after the decisive battle yesterday, but a peculiar emptiness. His body was hollow, his blood flowed smoothly through his meridians without a trace of energy fluctuation. What surprised Nianbing even more was that his painstakingly cultivated acupoints had all vanished. The Qingzhong acupoint on his chest was gone, the Life Sphere and Death Sphere were also gone, and the Xijing acupoint in his lower abdomen...\n\nThe Fangjia acupoint on his back vest had also completely disappeared. Even his esteemed Heavenly Eye and Huangji acupoints were gone. Everything had transformed into a form exactly like that of an ordinary person. Nianbing hadn't felt this way for many years.\n\nThe magical elements in the air were still unusually thin due to the awakening of the Seven Luminaries yesterday. Everything truly felt like a dream. Nianbing didn't feel any pain from the disappearance of his energy, because, at least, he was still alive. Being alive was much better than being dead. Even if he had lost all his abilities now, he was still alive!\n\nInside the tent, the faint fragrance mixed with the scent of nakedness made Nianbing unconsciously glance at his two wives again. Were they Feng Nu and Lan Chen now? Or were they Kao and Tianxiang? During the fusion process, Nianbing only remembered that the love he emitted had reached the most beautiful thing in the world, but he had lost all memory. He didn't know what happened afterward or what variations occurred during the fusion. At least, the fact that he was alive now was an anomaly!\n\nStanding up, he stretched his body slightly. Nianbing found that all the weakness had left him. His body felt light, indescribably comfortable. All the negative feelings he had experienced after returning from yesterday's decisive battle had vanished along with his abilities.\n\nWhat had happened to me? Nianbing really wanted to ask, but he didn't know who to ask. Should he wake up Feng Nu and Lan Chen? Seeing how soundly they were sleeping, Nianbing couldn't bear to make a sound. He was surprised to find that he didn't harbor any hatred towards Kao and Tianxiang in his heart. Instead, he felt some pity for them. For tens of thousands of years, how much loneliness and solitude had they endured just to defeat their opponents! Nianbing looked at Feng Nu and Lan Chen, feeling a little scared. What if, when they woke up, they weren't his beloved wives?\n\n\"Nianbing.\" A gentle voice startled Nianbing. He instinctively jumped a step to the side, scanning his surroundings, searching for the source of the voice. \"Who is it? Come out.\"\n\n\"Silly, I'm in your heart! Can't you recognize my voice?\" The gentle voice was as beautiful and melodious as a lark's song, which somewhat stabilized Nianbing's mind.\n\n\"Ah! Tianxiang, is that you? What did you say? You're in my heart? What does that mean?\"\n\nTianxiang's voice was still as gentle as ever. \"Silly, if I'm in your heart, then I'm in your heart. What else could it mean? Are you filled with confusion right now?\"\n\nNianbing nodded and said, \"Yes! What exactly happened later yesterday? Did you and Kao succeed? Didn't you say I would die? But I'm fine now, although I've lost all my abilities.\" As he said this, his spirits sank slightly. After all, those abilities were the result of more than a decade of hard cultivation and several life-threatening opportunities. Losing them suddenly, it was impossible not to feel a little sad. He had already woken up, and his thoughts were gradually becoming more realistic.\n\n\"Silly, you get the advantage and then complain? You little fool!\" Tianxiang's voice was like a lullaby, but it was filled with love.\n\nNianbing was stunned. Tianxiang's feelings for him had always been unpredictable, but now he clearly felt that after hearing Tianxiang's voice, his heart became warm and incredibly comfortable. \"What exactly is going on?\" He asked his inner question again.\n\n\"We can say we succeeded, or we can say we failed,\" Kao's voice echoed after Tianxiang's. Her voice was still as calm as ever, but within that calmness, it seemed to be comforting Nianbing's heart. Nianbing could clearly feel the invisible love.\n\nWhat was going on? Had the world changed? The two women who were going to use their lives to complete the fusion last night were now as gentle as his wives. Nianbing found it a bit amusing, and his curiosity grew even stronger.\n\nTianxiang said, \"Let me explain. The fusion process yesterday went very smoothly at the beginning. You cooperated very well with our fusion. Before our emotional domains could take effect, you had already entered the state. You used your love to nourish the souls of Feng Nu and Lan Chen, while our life and death energies also progressed towards fusion as your love surged. What surprised us was that we actually felt the souls of Feng Nu and Lan Chen, whom we had sealed, also erupt with love just like yours! Although their love wasn't as genuine as yours due to their sealed souls, it was very apparent, and under the influence of your surging love, their love also became stronger and stronger.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute.\" Nianbing frowned. \"From what you're saying, it sounds like love is also like energy. Is love truly a form of energy?\"\n\nKao sighed and said, \"We were also a bit doubtful at first, but the facts proved that love is indeed a special form of energy, and it seems to be a very powerful energy. The failure I'm talking about is because of this energy that surpassed ours. The love you emitted not only nourished your wives but also greatly affected us because we occupied their bodies. At first, we deliberately resisted the intrusion of your love. However, we did have love for you in our hearts. As your love continued to surge, we could no longer resist. It wasn't a physical energy attack, nor was it a mental energy invasion, so there was no way to resist it. Just when we thought you had harmed us, we were surprised to find that your love had no ill intentions towards us and instead became very gentle, bringing us much... wonderful sensation. However, we later understood that your love wasn't directed at us, and the seed of failure was sown at that time. Two emotions appeared in our hearts simultaneously: one was love for you, and the other was sorrow caused by the imminent harm we would inflict upon you. We realized that if we continued, when the fusion was complete, we would also die in endless sorrow, dying with you.\"\n\n\"That's so mystical? Sorrow can kill? But aren't we all alive and well now?\" Nianbing exclaimed with wide eyes.",

    "content": "\"Yes, we are all alive and well because, at the last moment, we finally understood the true meaning of love and why our fusion as Emotion Gods failed,\" Tian Xiang said with a hint of helplessness, but not dissatisfaction.\n\nNian Bing asked curiously, \"Why, exactly?\"\n\nTian Xiang sighed, \"Because we shouldn't have used you. That was our biggest mistake. Only at the pinnacle of love will the Emotion Gods fuse perfectly, and the peak state of love is sacrifice. This is the true meaning of love! What we wanted was only to take, thus, we were destined to fail. However, your love for Feng Nu and Lan Chen truly ascended to the realm of sacrifice. To be frank, although Kao and I were very surprised, we were also somewhat relieved. After we realized this, we simultaneously resolved that if we continued, it would mean total destruction, but if we changed our approach, the destruction would only befall the two of us. Do you know? As you climbed to the peak of love, Kao and I also finally reached the highest realm of love. We sacrificed not only our own love but also all of our energy. At that moment, we felt that even sacrificing our lives would be worth it. Therefore, the true Emotion God was indeed born.\"\n\nNian Bing stammered, \"You, you're not going to tell me that I've now become...\"\n\nTian Xiang chuckled, \"Your expression is so amusing! Yes, I can tell you explicitly that Kao and I have both made wedding dresses for you. You have now absorbed all of our abilities and have completely fused through the sublimation of love energy, becoming the perfectly absolute Emotion God.\"\n\nNian Bing's jaw dropped, unable to close. He never imagined things would turn out this way. He had become the Emotion God? Was that possible? But judging by Tian Xiang's words, she didn't seem to be joking.\n\nKao said, \"Tian Xiang is right. When we understood that the peak of love is sacrifice, we finally understood where the Father of Human Evolution went wrong. His mistake was creating us all as females. If we had been a man and a woman, we would likely have comprehended the true essence of the Emotion God tens of thousands of years ago. But as women, no matter what methods we used, we could never have succeeded in cultivating to that supreme realm. You, however, became our shared lover. Through our deep love and complete sacrifice, you absorbed all of our energy and transformed into a true god.\"\n\nNian Bing murmured, \"Then, then what about your current situation? After sacrificing all your abilities to me, wouldn't you...\"\n\nKao smiled, \"Don't worry, we won't die. True love is mutual sacrifice. Although we have lost our energy, we have created a god like you. With your abilities, you can help us be reborn at any time. Even though we have lost our powers, we can at least become ordinary women. You could say we are now a part of you. Your spiritual imprint now includes the two of us. Although we have lost our formidable abilities, we have gained the reward of staying by your side forever. You won't be able to abandon us, even if you wanted to. Even if you are the Emotion God.\"\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile, \"Is this considered forced seduction? And will Chenchen and Feng Nu be alright?\"\n\nTian Xiang replied, \"We don't care if it's forced seduction or not. In any case, when you accepted our abilities, you also accepted our love, and that will never change. Don't worry, your two ladies are perfectly fine. They are just too weak from a night of conquest. They just need a stable rest, and it won't affect their bodies at all. The sun has risen. I think it's time for you to face those divine beings.\"\n\nNian Bing said urgently, \"But I seem to have lost all my abilities now. I have no acupoints, no magic power, how can I fight? Also, where did Oscar go?\"\n\nKao explained, \"The dragon energy form within your body is indeed very strange. The moment you absorbed our two energies, it clearly sensed the massive energy fluctuations and immediately absorbed some of it before entering a dormant state. I imagine when it wakes up, it will be able to regain its physical form and become the most powerful dragon. Following you, Shark Hand¹ has indeed benefited greatly. As for the magic power you've lost, it's no longer important. You are now a god in the true sense of the word. What need do you have for magic? What need for acupoints? Remember, the ability of the Emotion God is emotion itself – controlling all emotions, including the emotions of all living beings, be it humans, animals, or plants. You can even grasp the emotions of stones. At the same time, you can also control the emotions of every celestial phenomenon in this world. If you wish, you can destroy anything in an instant. That's why we say the Emotion God is perfect. Everything has emotions, even the smallest magical element. You have now become the ultimate existence for all cultivators. Whatever you wish to do, you can do. As for how to use your abilities, that will depend on your own experience.\"\n\nNian Bing looked down at his hands. After hearing Kao's words, he suddenly felt a sense of grandeur, as if everything in heaven and earth was within his grasp. Subtle emotions flowed within his heart. Just as Kao had said, everything in the world possessed emotions, even the air. Every minuscule thing could be brought into various states under the control of emotion. The so-called lack of emotion was merely relative.\n\nTian Xiang encouraged him, \"Go, our great Emotion God, and shine your brilliance upon this world.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded slightly, \"Thank you for your sacrifice. I never imagined that one day I would become something I least believed in. The sacrifice of love, indeed, power is great. How strong can level eighteen energy be? Perhaps, I can truly annihilate those divine beings now.\"\n\nKao stated, \"What you have to face is not just the divine beings. The tens of thousands of years of grievances between us and those three fellows from Order will also be settled by you. There are no more uncertainties. I can already sense their presence, as they have detected our illusory puppets and are heading towards the Lost Continent, searching for us. However, due to our current location, it will still take them some time to find us.\"\n\nNian Bing carefully covered Feng Nu and Lan Chen with blankets. He sensed that his two wives harbored only one emotion in their hearts: sweetness. Gently caressing their beautiful faces, he whispered, \"Sleep, have a good rest. When you wake up, everything will be over.\" He kissed each of their foreheads before finally stepping out of the tent.\n\nIn just one night, his changes were so profound. Putting on a simple white robe, Nian Bing reappeared in the open air. The air greeted him joyfully. Looking out, everything was so full of vitality. The various emotions allowed Nian Bing to see another wonderful world, a wondrous world only he could see, a world composed of emotions. Each emotion had a different faint glow, and each emotion was constantly changing. The emotions of the warriors appeared somewhat solemn and worried. They were all busily engaged in their tasks.\n\n\"Don't worry, everything will be alright,\" Nian Bing said subconsciously. Suddenly, he saw a faint purple light emanating from his body, instantly covering the entire camp of the Radiant Continent allied forces. Everyone's gaze turned towards Nian Bing's location. Their emotions immediately fluctuated slightly. Worry gradually disappeared, replaced by a sense of joy. That feeling was exceptionally beautiful. Seeing the faint smiles on everyone's faces, Nian Bing was startled himself. He didn't feel any energy fluctuations from his body, but the facts were undeniable. Through the emotional changes of these people, he suddenly felt in his mind that everyone had heard his not-so-loud voice.\n\n\"See? Even your subconscious can alter the emotions of others. This is the power of a god. Every emotion is the best weapon of destruction. When emotions reach their extreme, they will mutate.\"\n\nA flash of inspiration struck Nian Bing's mind. Faced with reality, he finally understood the true mystery of the Emotion God.\n\nFamiliar figures gradually appeared before Nian Bing. On each face, astonishment was mixed with excitement. They had all heard Nian Bing's voice and felt the changes in their emotions, but they couldn't understand where the voice that appeared in the depths of their hearts came from.\n\nAs familiar faces kept appearing, Nian Bing smiled. He suddenly realized how wonderful it felt to have everything under his control.\n\nBing Ling and Rong Tian were the first to reach Nian Bing. They were surprised to find that the powerful aura that had originally emanated from their son had vanished, replaced by a sense of peace. His smile looked as warm as a spring breeze.\n\n\"Nian Bing, are you alright?\" Bing Ling asked with concern. Not being able to raise her son from a young age had always been her greatest regret. Now, her son's strength also meant she had to bear a heavy responsibility, constantly shrouded in potential danger.\n\nNian Bing smiled and shook his head, \"Mother, don't worry, I'm fine.\"\n\nThe Dark Dragon King, Buji Aosis, also walked over and stood beside Nian Bing, whispering, \"Nian Bing, since you have a way to deal with that divine curse, then there's no need to fight the Xi Realm again, is there? Our entire army can launch a full assault, and we still have a chance of winning. That arm left to us by Xie Yue² should be used now. Although it is an extremely evil thing, any evil thing can be used for good in the hands of the righteous. From the beginning of the great war, I hesitated whether to use it, but now it seems like the time has come.\"\n\nNian Bing sighed softly, \"Brother Kajie³, give me Xie Yue's arm.\"\n\nKajie Aosis did not hesitate. In the hands of the strong, even evil entities could be put to their greatest use. A flash of light appeared in his hand, and Xie Yue's arm, which he had sealed with dark magic, was presented to Nian Bing.\n\nSuddenly, Kajie Aosis was astonished to see Xie Yue's arm float up from his grasp as if it had lost all weight. It hovered in the air, the greyish-black arm exuding an even more sinister aura. Nian Bing said, \"Such an evil thing should not exist. It represents endless death. Go, return to your original form.\" A faint purple stream of energy drifted and enveloped the greyish-black arm. The arm began to transform. Under the encroachment of the purple light, the greyish-black arm trembled violently. Its skin gradually turned fair from its originally hideous color. In just a few blinks of an eye, this arm, which Xie Yue had prepared to deal with powerful enemies, became indistinguishable from a normal person's arm. It just appeared somewhat pale due to the absence of blood. The purple light disappeared, and with a slight gust of wind, the arm turned to dust and vanished, its former evil attack power completely nullified.\n\nNo one understood what kind of ability Nian Bing possessed, as they didn't feel any energy fluctuations. However, Nian Bing had truly achieved the perfect destruction of that evil entity. Everyone's gaze became even more bewildered.\n\nWith a slight smile, Nian Bing said, \"I know you are all very confused about how I have acquired such abilities. However, there is no time to explain now. The Xi Realm should already be waiting for me. After I resolve the troublesome divine beings, I will explain everything to you in detail, and then you will naturally understand everything. Rou'er⁴, muster the troops. Today, your mission is only to observe.\" Nian Bing's words were very calm, but they inadvertently revealed a powerful confidence. All the strong individuals of the Radiant Continent realized one thing: Nian Bing had achieved a new level of improvement in his cultivation.\n\nJoy spread through the ranks. Nian Bing's body, without any warning, floated up into the air. Without any elemental fluctuations, he was like a light feather, slowly flying towards the battlefield. Having mastered the emotions of the air, flying was as simple as can be for him.\n\n---\n¹ Shark Hand: This is a proper noun and refers to a character's name or title.\n² Xie Yue: This is a proper noun and refers to a character's name.\n³ Kajie: This is a proper noun and refers to a character's name.\n⁴ Rou'er: This is a proper noun and refers to a character's name.",

    "content": "當念冰飛抵戰場時，全身閃耀著金色光芒的希界已然等候在那裡。希界精神飽滿，表面上絲毫不像昨天才剛經歷過一場大戰。見念冰緩緩飛來，他眼中流露出強烈的霸氣和必勝的信念。\n\n「我來遲了，非常抱歉。」念冰微笑道。\n\n希界淡然道：「不，應該是我來早了。我們這場決戰，越早結束不是越好嗎？」兩天沒有食物和飲水，對神人軍隊的戰鬥力已有所影響。雖然他們都擁有遠超常人的實力，但終究還是血肉之軀，這一戰，當然是越早結束對神人越有利。\n\n念冰點點頭：「是啊！越早結束越好。希界，有一個對你來說是個好消息，我應該告訴你嗎？」\n\n希界一愣：「對我來說的好消息？你不會是想告訴我，你已經無法恢復實力與我一戰了吧。如果你認輸，或許能保住的只有性命，當然，我不介意神人中再多一名主神，你已經有這個資格。」\n\n念冰苦笑搖頭：「本來，我從不相信有神的存在，但現在看來，我不得不信了。你的算計很正確，因為昨天施展的七曜之覺醒，使空氣中的魔法元素變得異常稀薄，所以，我的魔法力確實沒有恢復。」\n\n希界淡然一笑：「那又如何？現在你還有選擇的機會。強者，本就該站在勝利的一方。只要你肯加入神人，我可以答應你成為我之下最高的統治者。」\n\n念冰搖頭：「壓抑了萬年的權力慾望一旦釋放，果然非常可怕。希界，你已經走入了一個怪圈。你的算計雖然很正確，但是，人算畢竟不如天算啊！神人，本就不該存在於這個世界上，你們終究是要消亡的。而今天，就是那個日子。」\n\n希界冷笑一聲：「那麼說，你還是要在魔法力沒有恢復的情況下，勉強與我一戰了？你這只是自取滅亡。」\n\n念冰笑了。「真的是這樣嗎？魔法對我來說已經不再重要，永遠不要小看你的對手。希界主神大人。仔細看一眼天空的太陽吧，因為，這將是你最後一次看到它的光芒。」\n\n希界怒喝一聲，他知道念冰是他無論如何也無法招攬的。既然如此，再多說下去又有何意義？他瞬間爆發了帶著三個竅穴的強大能量，一團耀眼的金色光芒瞬間釋放，金光散開，從四周向念冰包圍過來。他不想再讓念冰以那奇特的方式逃到一旁，使自己失去對他位置的感知，從而陷入苦戰。雖然算計了對方，但希界絲毫沒有小看自己的對手。\n\n念冰漂浮在那裡沒有動，眼看著金色光芒向自己圍攏過來，他的嘴角依舊帶著淡淡的笑意，彷彿這一切並不是在戰鬥，而是面對自己的朋友一般。\n\n希界心神微緊。他突然發現，漂浮在那裡的念冰全身每一處都是破綻，而這無處不在的破綻，卻讓他感到一絲不安，他仿佛又回到了第一次見到那三位真神的時候。\n\n時間沒有停留太久，在下方仰光大陸聯軍們的驚呼聲中，金色光芒順利地束縛住了念冰的身體。龐大的金光，充滿了強悍的攻擊力，就算是這世界上最堅硬的金屬，也會被擠壓成粉末。\n\n但是，念冰不是金屬。他先前對希界說，自己已經相信了這個世界上有神存在的真實，雖然是無奈的，但也是真實的。\n\n沒有任何光芒或魔法波動出現，當金光來到念冰面前時，卻突然停滯了。無論希界如何努力，他所發出的強大鬥氣也無法再前進一分。就在他微微一愣時，金光竟然毫無預兆地消失了。\n\n念冰依舊漂浮在那裡，從面對希界的那一刻起，他就再沒有移動過。但是，希界的心此時已沉入谷底，他不知道這究竟是為什麼發生，但卻真實地感覺到，念冰似乎已經不再是昨天那個用強大魔法與自己對抗的對手了。\n\n念冰輕嘆一聲：「確實不能再耽誤時間了。希界，我要告訴你對你來說的好消息就是，你所依仗的三位真神，馬上就要來到這裡。可惜的是，你永遠也無法再見到他們最後一面。去吧，帶著你那奢望中的夢想，和你所有的神人離開這個世界吧。或許，如果你還能有來生，應該選擇另一種活法。」\n\n紫色的氣流瀰漫而出，希界第一次看到念冰散發出這樣的光芒。皇極穴的能量瞬間提升到極點，但是，當那紫色光芒來臨時，他卻恐懼地發現，無論是自己的皇極穴還是方甲穴的防禦，對那紫色光芒都沒有任何阻擋作用。那並不是精神力的攻擊，而是一種奇特的能量，正是這種能量，讓他清晰地感覺到了恐懼。\n\n紫色光芒來臨，並沒有像希界想像中那樣，給他帶來身體上的傷害，但是，就在那短暫的一瞬間，他心中的恐懼感卻提升到了極限。\n\n恐懼的極限是什麼？是毀滅。\n\n在所有情緒中，除了愛以外，所有情緒的極限其實都是毀滅。念冰已經明白了這一點，所以，他只是用自己新獲得的情緒之神所擁有的最原始的能力，點燃了希界心中的恐懼。\n\n「啊——」在慘叫聲中，希界的臉色瞬間變得慘白。他不敢置信地看著念冰，心中的恐懼已經摧毀了他的意志和身體。再強大的能量，在自身情緒的波動中，也不會有任何影響。\n\n念冰控制了從皇極穴攻擊而來的能量，化解了希界的攻擊，而現在，他又輕易地控制了希界的情緒。看著心膽俱裂的希界，念冰嘆息一聲：「去吧，永遠地去吧。你手上沾染了太多的血腥，你手下的神人也是一樣。雖然我有能力改變你們的性格，但是，你們罪惡的靈魂卻應該受到懲罰。想知道我用什麼對付你的答案嗎？是情緒，而我，就是情緒之神。」\n\n「真正的神。」\n\n念冰的聲音只有希界能聽到。這也是他存在於這個世界上聽到的最後聲音。\n\n希界的身體並沒有破碎，也沒有被能量炸成粉末。在恐懼中完全失去生命力的他，身體猶如隕石般向下方墜落，跌落在雙方戰場的中央。\n\n念冰從開始到結束，甚至連手都沒有抬一下，就解決了已經恢復到七成實力，並且是主神之王級別的對手。情緒之神啊，神的能量，果然是如此的恐怖。\n\n天空，突然變得陰暗起來，但並不是因為烏雲遮蔽了陽光，遮蔽陽光的同樣也是雲朵，但這一次，卻是血色的濃雲。\n\n念冰看了一眼空中的血光，他知道，神之詛咒即將降臨。在這個詛咒面前，至少神人一方是無法抗衡的。\n\n下方的銀神瑟安和探索之神路索同時大喝一聲，不進反退，飛快地朝遠方逃去，想要脫離這血雲籠罩的範圍。他們的度，提升到了這一生中前所未有的高度。\n\n血雲中帶著詛咒，也帶著作為血之祭奠、血引的怨恨。霸神狂勻為了這個詛咒而死，現在，卻是他討還一切的時候了。\n\n血色光芒從天而降，每一道光芒，都會輕易地帶走一條生命。神人的生命，即使是迅速逃離的瑟安和路索這兩位主神也不例外。他們的實力，根本不足以達到與如此強大詛咒抗衡的條件。正如希界所說的那樣，在血之詛咒的作用下，不需要任何信諾，希界敗了，而他的神人們，也進入了毀滅的過程。\n\n仰光大陸聯軍們吃驚地看著眼前的一切。血雲正好在戰場最中間停滯，以那裡為中心，仰光大陸一方與神人一方，變成了冰火兩重天。一邊，是驚訝的注視；而另一邊，卻充斥著無盡的死亡。\n\n念冰看著神人們數量不斷減少，不禁嘆息道：「或許，只有死亡才能夠贖罪吧。你們罪惡的靈魂將在輪迴中得到清洗。再見了，神人，再見了，神之大陸。」他並沒有任何興奮的感覺。感受著神人們臨死前那驚恐的情緒，念冰不禁流露出一絲苦澀的表情。\n\n空氣中，淡淡的精神波動產生了。念冰的目光頓時變得有些緊張起來。一個清朗而熟悉的聲音從四面八方響起：「卡奧、天香，如果不是血之詛咒的指引，或許，我們還無法找到你們。」\n\n空中突然裂開一道縫隙，三道身影憑空出現。這奇異的景象，頓時引起仰光大陸聯軍中一陣騷動。\n\n出現的三個人，為首的，正是相貌英俊、一臉笑容的秩序之神。他的皮膚看上去更加瑩潤了幾分。在他左邊，同樣是一名青年，如果說秩序之神的相貌是英俊，那麼，他的相貌就只能用唯美來形容了，再沒有比他更完美的男人。可惜的是，在他那唯美的容貌中，卻多了幾分只應該屬於女性的柔媚。秩序之神的右邊，是一名身高竟然達到三米左右的壯漢。他身上的肌肉已經很難用言語來形容了，那完全超出正常人所能達到的範疇的強壯身體，只需要看上一眼，就能清晰地感覺到其中所包含的強大破壞力。\n\n「秩序之神，時間之神和毀滅之神。你們好。」念冰靜靜地看著面前的三位真神。他們，絕不是希界所能相比的。他們，擁有著連卡奧和天香也感到恐懼的氣息。\n\n秩序之神看到漂浮在空中的念冰，不禁楞了一下：「是你？這血之詛咒是你引動的嗎？」\n\n念冰看了一眼下方最後幾個即將消失於血光中的神人，說道：「可以這麼理解吧。希界與我賭戰，在血之詛咒面前賭戰，可惜，他輸了，輸掉了所有的神人。」\n\n秩序之神顯然並沒有因為希界和神人們的死而有任何憤怒的情緒出現。看著念冰，他臉上的笑容依舊存在著：「沒想到，這麼短時間不見，連希界也毀滅在你手上。不過，我很難相信，這是你所能擁有的實力。叫卡奧和天香出來吧，剛才我感覺到了她們合力使用半情緒之神能量的氣息。你們仰光大陸人類和這些神人之間的事情解決了，我們和她們之間的事，也該是時候解決了。數萬年過去了，我們終於要得到本應早已擁有的自由。」\n\n念冰回手指了指自己的胸口，微笑道：「卡奧和天香在我心裡，你想進去找她們嗎？」\n\n秩序之神眉頭微皺：「念冰，不要以為你們戰勝了神人，你就能以這樣的語氣跟我說話。別說是你，就算像當初遺失大陸那樣，毀滅你們人類所有文明，我也可以輕易做到。叫卡奧和天香出來，你們這些小螞蟻可以離開了，我對收割你們的生命，並沒有任何興趣。」\n\n一旁的時間之神身體瞬間向前平移，來到秩序之神身旁，用他那柔美的聲音向念冰道：「去吧，叫她們出來，老朋友們已經到了，她們還需要再躲藏下去嗎？」\n\n念冰淡然道：「毀滅一個文明，對你們來說，或許是一件很容易的事，但你們知道嗎？創造一個文明需要多長的時間？」\n\n秩序之神的目光變得冷了起來。空中的太陽突然在這個時候變成了血紅色，他淡淡地說道：「陽光，有著自己的秩序，但是，我可以將這個秩序改變成由我控制。既然你侮辱了我們，那麼，你就去吧，或許，到了地下，希界還能與你再次一戰。」",

    "content": "\"Order,\" the God of Time placed a hand on the God of Order's shoulder, and the faint yellow light in the God of Order's eyes disappeared. \"Forget it, Order. He wasn't wrong. You and Destruction really went too far that time. Destruction is always much easier than construction. After all, that was a civilization! Young man, you may go. Although the civilization of the Lost Continent has been lost, with your efforts on the Yangguang Continent, a new civilization can be brought here again, and life is the guarantee for your construction of civilization. To possess the ability to destroy the Xi Realm, regardless of whether you received help from Kao and Tianxiang, you are an excellent human being. I don't want to see you die like this. You must understand that resisting us is meaningless.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at the God of Time with some surprise. He felt different emotions from the three True Gods. The God of Destruction's emotions were black, symbolizing violence and slaughter, and boundless bloodshed. The God of Order's emotions were half gray and half white, with some positive emotions, but more negative ones. Only this God of Time's emotions were presented in a pure milky white, with even a hint of sadness.\n\n\"Thank you for your guidance, Lord God of Time. However, I would very much like to know, for whom does your sadness manifest?\"\n\nThe God of Time was stunned for a moment and said, \"Young man, your observation is very keen. You are right. I do have sadness in my heart. After all, they have been my opponents for tens of thousands of years! Thinking that they are about to be destroyed, I can't help but feel sad. However, that is our mission, something we must do. Go, call them out. Even if they hide themselves well, we can still sense their presence on this land.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded slightly and said, \"What you are looking for is not Kao and Tianxiang, but the God of Emotion, or rather, the imperfect demigod of emotion in your hearts. If that is the case, you only need to find me. In a sense, I am now Kao and Tianxiang. As long as you can destroy me, your decades of battle will be completely over.\"\n\nThe God of Destruction said in a loud and deep voice, \"Did Kao and Tianxiang send you to be a scapegoat?\"\n\nNian Bing did not answer the God of Destruction, but merely said lightly, \"What's past is past. You still haven't figured out who I am. The outcome of this war has already been decided. Just as I said to Xi Realm earlier, one must atone for the mistakes they have made. And your sins are too numerous. Indoctrination is no longer effective. Only death is your best choice.\"\n\nThe three True Gods finally sensed that something was wrong. Facing the three of them, a human who could remain unfazed by their aura and answer so easily, even resist them, could not be an ordinary person. They all saw a faint purple light emanating from him. Although there was no energy fluctuation, the expressions of the three True Gods changed simultaneously.\n\nThe God of Order's eyes turned yellow, the God of Destruction's eyes turned red, and the God of Time's eyes turned silver. The three of them flickered, and their original three figures suddenly disappeared. Only a phantom energy body appeared before the oncoming purple light.\n\n\"I rule the order of this world, and it shall proceed according to my order.\"\n\n\"I control the time of this world. I command time to stop.\"\n\n\"In this world, only I have the power to destroy everything. Destroy, sinful soul.\"\n\nThree voices sounded in the chaos. Three-colored light, also without any elemental fluctuations, floated out to meet the arc of purple light.\n\nThe moment the four-colored lights converged in the air, everything seemed to come to a standstill. The Yangguang Continent allied forces below maintained their postures from that instant, as if time had stopped and all order was changing. However, this situation only lasted for an instant.\n\nThe four-colored lights disappeared simultaneously, and a layer of purple aura appeared on the bodies of the three True Gods.\n\n\"Why, this is impossible,\" exclaimed the God of Order, who had reformed into three bodies, in a rage.\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly and said, \"Indeed, you possess the ability to control the order of everything. Unfortunately, emotions are ever-changing, and there is no order among emotions. Even if there were, it is not something you can grasp. The stopping of time does not affect the fluctuation of emotions. The stopping of time is always relative, while emotions are a permanent characteristic of all things and energies. Therefore, while the control of time might cause an ordinary person to die instantly from aging, it has no effect on me. As for destruction, destroying the body is easy, and destroying the spirit also doesn't seem difficult, but the emotions that exist in every element are indestructible. Do you understand now?\"\n\nThe God of Time looked at Nian Bing with a pale face, \"Qian, have you become the true God of Emotion? No, how is this possible?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and said, \"In this world, nothing is impossible. I understood this truth when I was very young. Your existence should also be impossible, but haven't you appeared? Kao and Tianxiang created me, the God of Emotion, precisely because they understood the ultimate profound meaning of emotions. Your battle will come to a perfect conclusion today. Although you possess the strength to destroy Kao and Tianxiang, you can never contend with the God of Emotion. My ability to control emotions reaches the eighteenth order every moment, a number that cannot be quantified. Even with thirty more True Gods, your outcome would not have changed in the slightest.\"\n\nThe God of Order and the God of Destruction roared in anger, but they were horrified to find that they had activated the abilities they should have controlled, and everything had become simple. There were no spectacular scenes. All they saw was a faint smile on the corner of Nian Bing's mouth.\n\nTwo figures, one black and one white, separated from Nian Bing's body. They were not energy forms, but two real figures. They had the same appearance, and their perfect pretty faces showed gentle smiles.\n\nKao said, \"Yes! Everything should end. From the day we were born until today, fifty thousand years later, we have been fighting without stopping. Now, the true God of Emotion will resolve these matters.\"\n\nTianxiang said, \"Although fifty thousand years have passed, the Father of Human Evolution has ultimately defeated the Father of Technology. You have to admit your failure.\"\n\nNian Bing's gaze suddenly became solemn. He said in a deep voice, \"God of Order, in the name of the God of Emotion, I bestow upon you resentment. God of Destruction, in the name of the God of Emotion, I bestow upon you anger. Go. Disappear at the extreme of emotion.\"\n\nPurple light instantly turned the two True Gods purple. With an incomparably furious roar and a sigh full of unwillingness and resentment, the two balls of light transformed into the smallest elements in the world and disappeared. At the extreme of their respective emotions, the God of Order and the God of Destruction, without even leaving a spiritual imprint, vanished with the extreme of their souls' emotions.\n\nThe God of Time did not look at the two companions who had disappeared, with whom he had been for a full fifty thousand years. His gaze was calm. \"Before I follow them, I would like to know, under what circumstances did you comprehend the ultimate profound meaning of the God of Emotion? And what is this profound meaning? If I remember correctly, two days ago, when we used our abilities to sense your strength, you hadn't changed much. I find it hard to believe this was your instantaneous enlightenment.\"\n\nKao smiled slightly and said, \"No matter how unwilling you are to believe it, this is the truth. In fact, it's nothing to tell you. When the Father of Human Evolution was born, his mistake was creating us as the same gender. And the two extreme energies of life and death could only be perfectly integrated at the peak of love. Love is the most special of all emotions, and it is the only emotion where the ultimate sublimation does not lead to destruction. And Tianxiang and I are both female, so no matter how we cultivate, this situation of extreme love could never occur. We also realized all of this yesterday, and this realization only took an instant, which was enough. In that instant, we finally understood that the peak of love is dedication, and it was in that instant that Nian Bing became the true God of Emotion.\"\n\nThe God of Time stared blankly for a few seconds, and a bitter smile appeared on his face. \"Thank you for telling me this. I finally understand. Yes, you are right, the Father of Technology has ultimately lost to the Father of Human Evolution, and this world finally has a god in the true sense of the word. To comprehend the true meaning of love, such a god can only bring benefits to this world.\" Saying this, his gaze fell on Nian Bing. \"Please protect this beautiful continent. Now, what emotion will you bring me? I am very curious about what emotion I will be in when I perish.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, looking at the God of Time's perfect, woman-like face. \"If I wanted to bestow an emotion upon you, I wouldn't have kept you until now, nor would I have let Kao and Tianxiang say so much to you. In fact, the God of Emotion is not a specific existence, and it doesn't even require the convergence of life and death energies as a foundation. Anyone can become the God of Emotion, their power simply varies. God of Time, I can sense all the changes in your emotions. From your emotions, I can understand what kind of person you are. You are different from the God of Order and the God of Destruction. The emotion you need is something only you can pursue. Now, you may go.\"\n\nThe God of Time asked in surprise, \"You are not killing me?\"\n\nNian Bing shrugged his shoulders and said, \"Do I have any reason to kill you? Don't worry, I'm not sparing your life because you are as beautiful as a woman. Your life is preserved by your own emotions.\"\n\nThe God of Time said irritably, \"You've hit my deepest wound. I hate it the most when people say I'm as beautiful as a woman.\"\n\nNian Bing laughed heartily and said, \"But it's the truth. To describe you, I can only use beautiful, not handsome, right?\"\n\nThe God of Time also smiled. \"I don't know why, but I don't feel any sadness at the deaths of the God of Order and the God of Destruction. Instead, I feel very relaxed. Perhaps it's because the burden we've been carrying has been suddenly lifted.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"This must be the sublimation of your emotions. And precisely because of this, you don't need to think about anything else now. I think, like Kao and Tianxiang, you have long wished to live your own lives, or rather, the lives of ordinary people.\"\n\nThe God of Time nodded and said, \"Yes. We originally planned to leave this world immediately after defeating Kao and Tianxiang to seek another world with life and live a new life. With our strength, this was entirely possible. But now, it seems only I will go alone. I never expected that our three-in-one battle technique, which we painstakingly cultivated to perfection, would be completely useless, and we would lose their lives. Perhaps all of this was destined by heaven. The facts are all laid out, and there's no point in me saying anything more. Alright, I should go. Perhaps we will never meet again. Kao, Tianxiang, congratulations on finding your own happiness, while I still have to continue searching. Who knows, maybe I too can comprehend the feeling of love at its peak.\" After saying this, he smiled resolutely, turned his body slightly in the air, broke through space, and floated away.\n\nLooking at the place where the God of Time departed, Nian Bing felt a sense of relief. What he had to do was finally over. Everything could be described as a dramatic change. He never expected the final outcome to be like this. The God of Time was gone, the God of Order and the God of Destruction had vanished under his newly acquired emotional powers, and the greatest threat to the Yangguang Continent, the Divine Beings, had bid farewell to the river of history. Everything was so wonderful.\n\n\"Nian Bing, what are you thinking about?\" Kao asked with a smile.\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile and said, \"I'm thinking about how to explain your existence to my parents, friends, and wives. Haven't you noticed that the positive Yangguang Continent allied forces are all watching us? How am I supposed to explain this to them?\"\n\nTianxiang chuckled and said, \"Isn't this simple? You can control anyone's emotions, so it's easy to make them accept us.\"",

    "content": "Nian Bing said solemnly, \"The power of gods is absolutely terrifying. Although I am the God of Emotion, from now on, I will never use my abilities lightly. Otherwise, wouldn't I also bring a lot of unnecessary trouble like the God-Man? Now that everything has been resolved, I am the same as you were before. I hope to be an ordinary person and live an ordinary life. Actually, perhaps you won't believe me, but I have another pursuit, and it's time for me to strive for that pursuit.\"\n\nKao said, \"Nian Bing, you don't need to worry about anything. I think with two more wives, given your current strength and contributions to the Radiant Continent, no one will doubt you. As for your three wives, leave the communication to us. You must believe us. Although we have lost our abilities, fifty thousand years were not lived in vain.\"\n\nLooking at Kao and Tian Xiang's confident gazes, Nian Bing smiled. That's right! He had gained their abilities, but Kao and Tian Xiang had also gained his most sincere love in the process of fusion. This world, whether it was the Radiant Continent or the Lost Continent, would come to an end today, and also a new beginning.\n\nThe sunlight was so warm. Although this was not the dawn, Nian Bing felt exceptionally close. He knew that he would no longer participate in any continental wars or other disputes, but would fully enjoy life with his family and friends.\n\nTime passed quickly. Three years flew by, leaving only faint memories.\n\nAolan City, the capital of the Aolan Empire, had now become a prosperous scene. Compared to a few years ago, not only had the entire Aolan Empire undergone earth-shattering changes, but the entire Aolan Empire had also changed. And all of this was due to the appearance of the Lost Continent.\n\nIn the past few years, the Radiant Continent had undergone tremendous changes. The four great empires had signed a new peace treaty with a term of one hundred years, and the main content of the treaty consisted of only five words: peace and development.\n\nWith the vast newly appeared land of the Lost Continent, the four great empires no longer needed to wage war to expand their territories. What they needed most now was to continuously utilize the resources of the Radiant Continent and the unique natural reserves of the Lost Continent to rebuild that continent.\n\nAfter the appearance of the Lost Continent, the Ice Moon Empire and the Aolan Empire, which were originally weaker on the Radiant Continent, benefited the most. Because they were closest to the passage to the Lost Continent, they had a great advantage. The Aolan Empire and the Ice Moon Empire cooperated fully, and based on the first freshwater lake, Ice Moon Lake, which appeared more than three years ago, they gradually expanded into the inland of the Lost Continent. The Huarong Empire, on the other hand, expanded from another direction through its powerful maritime transport capabilities. Due to the uncertainty of the sea and the long journey, the pace of Huarong Empire's development was restricted. Thus, a new landscape of balance among the four great empires gradually formed on the Lost Continent.\n\nThe Langmu Empire also had its own advantages. Relying on the various grain crops produced in its country, they traded with the Ice Moon Empire and the Aolan Empire, gaining the right to pass through the borders of the two countries. Outside the territories divided by the two countries, they also developed themselves.\n\nThree years had passed, and the once dead and silent Lost Continent had presented a brand new scene. Crops were thriving everywhere, and in some geographically advantageous locations, cities had begun to be built. Currently, only two cities had been fully completed on the Lost Continent. One was Bingnian City, built by the Ice Moon Empire relying on Ice Moon Lake, and the other was Yibing City, built by the Aolan Empire on the other side. The appearance of these two cities greatly increased the development of the Aolan Empire and the Ice Moon Empire on the Lost Continent. The two countries encouraged people to reproduce quickly and sent batches of civilians to live on the Lost Continent under the protection of the army. To achieve this level, the Langmu Empire and the Huarong Empire still had a lot of work to do.\n\nUnder the balance brought by the heavens, the strength of the four great empires was steadily developing towards a state of approaching each other.\n\nIn the past three years, the top echelons of the four great empires had undergone certain changes. First was the Ice Moon Empire. The King of the Ice Moon Empire, Yan Feng, had now become a wise ruler, and the entire country was united. The Ice God Tower also declared its allegiance to the Ice Moon Empire and merged with the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild, dividing its management into two major parts. Bei Bingling, the Ice Goddess Priestess of the Ice God Tower, and Long Zhi, the president of the Ice Moon Empire's Mage Guild, respectively became the Chief and Second Chief Mage Elders of the Ice Moon Empire. The Ice Moon Empire, through continuous cultivation, had greatly enhanced the strength of its mages, which was a significant indicator of the Ice Moon Empire's growing national power.\n\nThe greatest change among the four great empires was in the Huarong Empire, once the strongest nation on the Radiant Continent. Emperor Huatian passed away at the age of eighty-nine, and his son succeeded to the throne. The Rong family continued to be highly regarded, but the head of the Rong family was no longer Prince Rong. After the battle with the God-Man three years ago, due to the annihilation of the two cavalry regiments he had painstakingly created, Prince Rong laid down all his glory and retired to the Rong family. His eldest son, Rong Yue, took over the position of head of the Rong family. Although the Rong family was still highly valued, their prestige had greatly diminished after losing the Flame Lion Knights and the Flame Demon Dragon Knights. However, this was precisely the outcome Prince Rong wished to see. After all, a tree that stands out from the forest will be destroyed by the wind. Being low-key was the best choice for the Rong family. Prime Minister Su Yue also chose to retire in the second year after Prince Rong's retirement. Although the new king tried his best to persuade him, Su Yue refused, citing his old age. Thus, the three great figures who founded the Huarong Empire in those years successively left the political stage, and a new situation emerged.\n\nThe King of the Langmu Empire died of illness, and Prince Mu Rong ascended the new throne with the support of Duke Mu Jing, who had made great contributions on the Lost Continent, allowing the Langmu Empire's territory to successfully expand to the Lost Continent. However, to the surprise of the Langmu Empire's high command, two years later, after Mu Rong had secured his throne, Mu Jing, who was the Empire's Prime Minister and First Princess, suddenly retired from all her positions in the country and disappeared without a trace. A similar situation also occurred in the Aolan Empire. After two years of continuous recuperation and joint development with the Ice Moon Empire, everything in the Aolan Empire was back on track. At this moment, Noel, the youngest and most intelligent imperial prime minister in Aolan Empire's history, resigned. Before her departure, she designated a new prime minister to succeed her. Originally, this should have been decided by the king, but Noel's contributions to the Aolan Empire were recognized by everyone, and her final decision was approved by the king.\n\nAlthough there were political changes in the four great empires, every monarch knew that now was the time for diligent development. Within the hundred-year contract, war was unlikely to occur again. At the same time, in the hearts of the high command of the four great empires, there was one name that they remembered most vividly, and because of this name, they would never dare to easily start a war.\n\nThree years ago, after Nian Bing led the allied forces of the Radiant Continent to victory, before he left, he only said a simple sentence. He told the high command of the four armies to convey to the kings of the four nations that he did not wish to see war for the next hundred years. It was precisely this sentence that prompted the four great empires to complete that hundred-year contract.\n\nIt wasn't that Nian Bing didn't want to extend this period, but he understood that everything in the world had its own rules. A hundred-year restriction was long enough. War was inevitable, but as long as humanity continued to develop, these things would have nothing to do with him.\n\nAolan City was more lively than usual today. At this time, some strange people arrived at the east city gate. Under the efforts of former Prime Minister Noel, Aolan City had become a place with high walls and strong defenses, and its soldiers were well-trained, giving it the appearance of a great nation. Those responsible for guarding the city were forty imposing and spirited soldiers, whose spears glinted with a dazzling cold light under the sunlight.\n\nThe squad leader among the city guards was quickly attracted by these strangely dressed people who were about to enter the city. He waved his hand, and ten soldiers immediately stopped them.\n\nThe reason these people were called strange was mainly due to their attire. They were all dressed in simple white cloth robes, but they all wore large bamboo hats, with three-foot-long veils hanging from the hats, obscuring their faces. Only their figures could be vaguely seen through the wide cloth robes. Most of these people were women.\n\nIn the eyes of the squad leader, covering one's face must be for some unspeakable reason. As soon as his subordinates stopped these people, he immediately stepped forward and said sternly, \"Take off your bamboo hats. Where are you from?\"\n\nA person in white stepped forward. He did not take off his bamboo hat. His tall and proud body naturally gave the squad leader a sense of pressure. A peaceful voice came from behind the veil, \"We are here to participate in the Chef God Competition. We are from the Ice Moon Empire.\"\n\nUpon hearing that they were from the Ice Moon Empire, the squad leader's expression relaxed a little. He nodded and smiled, \"So you are guests from the Ice Moon Empire participating in the Chef God Competition. In that case, you can naturally enter the city. However, before entering the city, you must let me see your faces. This is a rule, I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe person in white chuckled and said, \"Do you really want to see?\"\n\nThe squad leader said firmly, \"Yes, this is our duty.\"\n\nJust then, a petite but well-proportioned person in white came behind the person in white. She seemed about to say something but was stopped by the person in white.\n\n\"Forget it. Since this is the rule of the Aolan Empire, we must abide by it. They are just doing their duty, and they are not wrong.\"\n\n\"But...\" the person in white who came later had an exceptionally pleasant voice, and her voice carried a hint of doubt.\n\n\"It's just a glance, it's nothing. I think after he sees us, he will understand why we wear bamboo hats.\"\n\nThe squad leader was indeed a little expectant now. Although he feared that these people were lepers, he had to uphold his duty for the sake of his responsibility. After all, becoming a squad leader was the result of his years of hard work. The treatment of the Aolan Empire's army was much better than before. The salary alone was enough for his family's living expenses. He absolutely could not cause any bad consequences due to a moment's negligence.\n\nThe former person in white slowly lifted his veil, and the people in white behind him also lifted the veils of their bamboo hats. At this time, the people in white formed an arc. Only the ten soldiers and the squad leader could see their true faces.\n\nWhen the squad leader saw the true faces of these people, his body trembled and he fell into a complete daze.\n\nThe person in white at the front smiled and said, \"Now, you should understand.\"\n\nThe squad leader nodded silently and said, \"Please enter the city.\"\n\nThe people in white put down their veils again, and the squad leader and his subordinates breathed a sigh of relief in unison, allowing them to enter Aolan City.\n\n\"Captain, I, did I just see correctly? Are those goddesses descended from heaven?\" a soldier who had a good relationship with the squad leader whispered.\n\nThe squad leader said sternly, \"Hurry up and get to your post, don't talk nonsense here.\"\n\nThe soldier stuck out his tongue and continued his duty. The squad leader's heart was churning like a stormy sea. He knew very well that what he had just seen was not an illusion. That one man and seven women were indeed, as his subordinate said, not like beings that should appear in this world. That man had long golden hair and handsome features that even the best sculptor could not carve. His tall body and gentle smile made people feel a sense of closeness. His deep blue eyes held a profound depth like the ocean. For the first time in his life, the squad leader had seen such an outstanding man.\n\nHowever, what surprised the squad leader even more were the women who came with this man. They all looked to be around twenty years old. The woman who spoke earlier had long blue hair like a waterfall. Her appearance was somewhat familiar, and she also had blue eyes, but unlike the man at the front, her blue eyes seemed to be filled with wisdom, and her whole body exuded an invisible majesty that made him not dare to stop her at all. The following few women were more outstanding than each other. There was a peerless beauty with red hair, a woman of ice who exuded a cold aura but wore a smile, a woman with black hair, a charming smile, and a terrifying aura, and even a woman with green hair who made people feel comfortable at first glance. These women were all exceptional. Even one of them appearing alone would likely cause a stir in a city. However, so many appeared at once. How many were there? The squad leader carefully counted. It seemed there were a total of eight women, representing eight different kinds of beauty. They all had one thing in common: when their eyes fell on the golden man at the front, they revealed a faint tenderness. Such a combination must have an extraordinary background, no wonder they concealed their appearances so deeply. Yes! If they hadn't worn bamboo hats that could cover their faces, they would have attracted everyone's attention as soon as they entered the city. What did that man say? They were here to participate in the Chef God Competition. How could it be? Judging by their appearances, none of them looked like chefs!\n\nThe Chef God Competition, held once every five years, was this time hosted by the Aolan Empire. Since the emergence of a new Chef God in the last competition, the continent's nations had entered a period of peace. Perhaps a person could live without anything else in their life, and their wives might die of old age before them. However, food and water would always accompany every person throughout their lives until the end of their lives. Perhaps it was for this reason that the status of chefs on the continent had become increasingly high. A top chef could easily become a target for various factions to woo.\n\nTherefore, this year's Chef God Competition attracted a great deal of attention. The Aolan Empire had also made considerable efforts for this competition. Not only were the rewards astonishing, but for this Chef God Competition, the plaza in front of the Aolan Empire's imperial palace had been rebuilt to create a huge competition venue that could accommodate one hundred thousand spectators. At the same time, thirty thousand troops had been dispatched to maintain order within Aolan City once the Chef God Competition began, showing how much the authorities valued this competition. It was said that at the final round, the King of the Aolan Empire would personally attend the venue and present the highest honor in the culinary world to the final Chef God – the Chef God Crown, made of gold and jewels.\n\n\"Ah! It feels really good to be back in the city. Living a plain life every day, and occasionally coming to the city to take a look, it really feels good!\" a moving female voice sounded. The speaker was one of the people in white who had just entered the city. She walked in the middle of all nine people in white, her voice carrying a tender feeling.\n\n\"Maomao, I'm sorry for you to suffer with us. How about you stay in Aolan City for a while after this Chef God Competition? With your sister Luo Rou arranging for you, I'm sure you'll have a good time.\"\n\nThis group of people was none other than Nian Bing and his companions, who had disappeared from the continent for three years. The squad leader who guarded the city had only understood part of the reason why Nian Bing and his companions concealed their appearances. Besides their looks, the identities of each of them were enough to cause an earthquake of level seven or higher on the Radiant Continent.",

    "content": "念冰身後，跟著的是奧蘭帝國前任宰相，化名諾爾的智慧之女洛柔；再後面，是鳳女、藍晨、龍靈、生命之神卡奧、死亡之神天香，以及貓貓和木晶。這八位女子在一年前才全部聚集在一起，這讓念冰頗為為難。他本來只有三位妻子，但卡奧和天香的到來，卻不得不讓這個數字由三變成了五。念冰也不知道卡奧和天香對他原來的妻子們說了些什麼，鳳女、藍晨和龍靈她們不但同意她們加入，而且，現在卡奧和天香隱隱已經成為了眾女之首。而我們堂堂的情緒之神念冰，現在卻是整個家中最可憐的廚師，每天，他最重要的工作就是完成三餐，讓他的妻子們品嘗。\n\n貓貓一直跟著念冰。白人一族已經毀滅，她根本無處可去，念冰也不忍心讓她獨自流浪。即使她現在的實力已經達到了駭人聽聞的地步，但在念冰心中，她始終是那個小妹妹。至於洛柔和木晶，她們倆好似約好了一般，一年前直接找到了念冰等人的隱居之處。念冰選擇的隱居之所，就是在冰月帝國的桃花林中。查極對他有再造之恩，他永遠不會忘記自己的那位鬼廚師傅帶給他的一切，因此，他就帶著妻子們和查極、冰潔夫婦做了鄰居。\n\n洛柔和木晶的到來，引起了念冰妻子的些許不滿，但洛柔和木晶都極為乖巧，一點也沒有先前身居高位者的樣子。她們不但刻意和念冰保持距離，還主動承擔起了一些家務。一年的時間過去了，她們用自己的表現贏得了鳳女等人的讚賞，現在，已經基本融入了這個大家庭。\n\n作為眾香國中唯一的男子，念冰並沒有過上如帝王般的生活。用他自己的話來說，他就像一個可憐的小奴隸，每天為他的女主人們忙前忙後地做飯。本來，他是不需要受到這種待遇的，但天香卻說，如果不對念冰嚴苛一點，以他神的實力，肯定會欺負她們這群可憐的女孩子。因此，念冰就成了家中唯一的廚師。直到洛柔和木晶到來後，他才不用再做洗碗的工作，終於變得輕鬆了一些。\n\n每到晚上，念冰立刻就會從奴隸變回主人。貓貓曾好奇地問過，為什麼五位姐姐每天晚上都要抽籤呢？很久以後，在一個卡奧和天香稱為聖誕節的日子裡，貓貓才真正明白了。\n\n卡奧以念冰的身體狀況為由，規定每天晚上陪伴他的只能是一名妻子。只有當念冰做出了什麼絕世好菜，才能得到兩位妻子的獎勵。這也成為了念冰生活中最大的樂趣。\n\n沒有了權力鬥爭，沒有了刻骨仇恨。生活雖然平淡有序，但念冰卻過得異常滿足。父親融天並沒有真的回融家，而是選擇留在冰神塔陪伴自己的妻子。念冰隱居的地方離冰神塔很近，只需要簡單的一個傳送魔法，他就能隨時去看望自己的父母。而冰神塔在冰靈的改革下，已經沒有了以前不允許結婚的條例。最先得到實惠的就是冰月帝國魔法師工會，要知道，冰神塔中不論男女冰雪祭祀，都有著出色的容貌。\n\n三年時間過去了，念冰感覺這三年似乎過得飛快，彷彿與神人一戰還在眼前。但三年的清淡生活，又使他已經近乎忘記了自己情緒之神的身份，彷彿自己只是一個再普通不過的廚師。今年，他又有了新的興奮點，一路走來，他目光最多的地方就是龍靈的小腹。念冰雖然有五位妻子，但卡奧和天香都是由元素凝結成的實體，雖然表面上與常人無異，但她們並不具備生育能力。而作為冰鳳凰和火鳳凰的藍晨和鳳女，雖然能夠生育，但她們懷孕的機率卻小得可憐。雖然念冰一直努力著，但到現在也沒有見她們肚子有什麼動靜。而就在幾個月前，桃花林中傳來了兩個喜訊：一個是龍靈懷上了念冰的孩子，新的小生命即將誕生；另一個則是來自查極和冰潔夫婦，念冰所說的枯木逢春變成了現實，老查極不負眾望，終於讓這位曾經是冰雪女神祭祀的妻子成功懷上了自己的骨血。這一對師徒同時大喜，兩人竟背著妻子偷偷定了指腹為婚的親事，而且還是查極主動提出的。\n\n本來，念冰還有些猶豫，畢竟查極是自己的師傅，輩分上就亂了。但查極卻說，他們是街坊，可以按街坊輩分算，各論各的。\n\n念冰一是不忍違逆師傅的好意，再者看到恢復年輕的查極足夠英俊，而他的妻子前任冰雪女神祭祀冰潔也是一位絕色美女，無論生男生女，應該都會很不錯，因此也就同意了。查極的想法更為直接，在他看來，念冰的基因可以說是這個世界上人類所能擁有的最佳基因，沒有誰能與他相比。而龍靈又是那麼溫柔美麗的女孩，他們生下的孩子，必然是鍾靈毓秀、天下英才。雖然輩分有些亂，但如果能成功配對，自然是最好的選擇。因此，查極在剛得知龍靈也懷孕的消息後，立刻就和念冰確定了這門婚事。念冰感念師傅的恩情，自然不會拒絕。\n\n現在，龍靈也成了眾女中的重點保護對象。一路走來，不論是飛行還是步行，鳳女、藍晨、卡奧、天香都會特意將她護在中間。就連念冰想碰龍靈一下，都要經過四女的同意才行。在這個大家庭中，一個新生命的誕生，將帶來的是全新的生機。\n\n隱居三年，念冰唯一還未完成的願望，就是和小天在廚藝上的一戰。本來他是想和師傅查極一起來的，但查極執意要帶著冰潔早出來幾天，說是要先見見幾位老朋友。念冰知道，自己的師傅現在也應該就在這座奧蘭城中。\n\n五年一度的廚神大賽即將開始了。念冰回想起當年華龍廚藝挑戰賽時和小天那未完的對決，心情就不禁激盪起來。\n\n小天，你是不是也在期待著我的出現呢？這一次，我絕不會再讓你失望。就讓我們之間的巔峰對決，來決定這場廚神大賽的勝利者，也一同去攀登廚藝的巔峰。\n\n奧蘭城一座普通的旅店裡，一位身穿黑色長袍的年輕人正坐在房間裡閉目養神。他有著一雙特殊的手，看上去極為細膩，即使女人也不可能擁有如此白皙的一雙手。他的手指非常修長，手掌雖然說不上寬厚，卻恰到好處，似乎有一層牛奶般的光華在手掌上流轉著。\n\n門開了，一名女子悄無聲息地從外面走了進來。她腳步很輕，悄悄來到閉目養神的男子身後，雙手按上他的肩膀，輕輕揉捏著。\n\n男子臉上流露出一絲淡淡的微笑，緩緩睜開眼睛，抬手按住肩膀上那雙柔若無骨的玉手，說道：「妳回來了。現在報名情況如何？」\n\n女子輕嘆一聲，說道：「沒有他。五年了，他沒有任何消息，你還是那麼執意要等待他的出現嗎？」\n\n男子眼中閃過一道耀眼的光華，看著自己的雙手，說道：「我終於將陰陽調和太極手練到了極限。與五年前相比，我的廚藝現在才算得上大成。但是，如果我不能戰勝他，那麼，我就永遠不是真正的廚神。廚藝界高手眾多，但真正能夠讓我視為對手的，也只有他而已。師傅當年教導我廚藝的時候就曾說過，如果我不能戰勝鬼廚查極或者他的弟子，那麼，我就不能自稱為烈廚神[1]的弟子。漠漠，你應該很明白我的期盼。」\n\n漠漠彎下腰，將臉貼上小天的臉頰，說道：「那如果他永遠都不出現呢？你就一直這樣等下去嗎？小天，我不想看到你因為他沒出現而失望。」\n\n小天微微一笑，但他眼神卻異常堅定：「是的，我會一直等下去。即使每一次都是失望，但我也不會改變自己的想法。這是我一生最大的心願啊！五年才有一次的機會，我有預感，這一次他一定會出現的。我相信，他有著和我一樣的想法。雖然我們並沒有仔細交流過什麼，但是，我們都是一類人。作為一名優秀的廚師，我們都渴望著與對方一戰。我一直在等待著今天的到來，念冰未嘗就不是呢？我以武入廚，已經將廚藝修煉到了極限，而他以魔法入廚，不知道現在練到了什麼程度。五年了，念冰，不要讓你的名聲繼續失落啊！」\n\n奧蘭帝國皇宮前，巨大的廣場成扇形向外延伸著。在廣場靠皇宮的一面，早已擺下了百張廚台，這裡，就是廚神大賽進行的地方。而在所有廚台最中央的地方，圍攏著一個高約三丈，直徑達五丈的巨大青台。平台上也有兩張廚案和各種廚師所需的工具，這兩張廚案和那些工具，竟然完全都是金色的。稍微有點廚藝知識的廚師都知道，那雖然並非黃金打造的廚具，但卻是廚神大賽決賽時專用的精金廚神裝備，由特殊的合金製作而成，能夠最大程度地體現出美食的所有微妙之處，保留住最原始的營養成分。仰光大陸上的每一名廚師都以能夠使用這套精金廚神裝備為最大的榮耀，在廚藝界來說，這就是真正的神器。每一屆廚神大賽，都是由廚藝界元老們組成的廚神協會來主辦，而這兩套精金廚神裝備，也一直都是由廚神協會保存，只有五年一度的廚神大賽才會取出，供最後進入決賽的兩名廚師使用。也正是因為精金廚神裝備的稀有，才使得它所代表了最高的榮譽感。在陽光的照射下，全套廚神精金裝備閃耀著奪目的光彩，即使是奧蘭皇家廣場站在最外面的平民也能清晰地看到它們的存在。\n\n五年一度的廚神大賽就要開始了。平民們看的只是一個熱鬧，而廚藝界的元老們看的，卻是廚藝界能否繼小天之後再出現一些新的人才。大陸的和諧與繁榮，使廚藝界的發展極為迅速，基本上每五年，都會提升到一個新的台階，各種新奇的廚藝層出不窮。雖然未必都是頂級廚藝，但對廚藝界還是有著不小的推動作用。也正是因為如此，廚神大賽才變得越來越受到四大帝國的重視。\n\n奧蘭城的民眾們在至少一萬名士兵的監督下，已經開始在奧蘭皇家廣場周圍有序地排列起來。奧蘭城難得有這樣的盛世，放眼望去，人頭攢動，密密麻麻的，就連奧蘭帝國第一大廣場，也很難承受如此多人的簇擁。在有序的指揮下，來晚的平民只能在遠方觀看了，雖然他們只能看到一些模糊的景象，但卻依舊沒有人願意離開。\n\n清晨的太陽光芒還很柔和，陽光帶來的溫暖讓觀戰的平民們氣氛越來越熱烈。一些熟悉廚神大賽的人已經開始討論這一屆最後將由誰獲得冠軍，他們討論的話題，大多是圍繞著上屆廚神小天而來的。五年前的廚神大賽，小天以他那神奇的陰陽調和太極手給廚藝界帶來了巨大的震撼。這號稱廚藝界第一手法的奇技，使廚藝界的元老們都為之驚嘆。一代新人勝舊人，很多廚藝界的元老都認為小天的技藝已經超越了當初廚藝界的一代鬼才鬼廚查極。\n\n「請大家靜一靜，比賽即將開始，希望大家能體現出我們奧蘭帝國的文明，給所有參賽選手留下一個最好的比賽環境。」一位年輕英俊的主持人走上廚神大賽最後決賽的舞台，用魔法擴音器將自己的聲音傳到廣場的每一個角落。民眾們的聲音漸漸低了下來，接近二十萬人的目光都落在了這位主持人身上。\n\n---\n[1] 烈廚神：此處為人名，音譯或直譯均可。",

    "content": "The host, seeing the situation was under control, smiled and said, \"Good, thank you everyone for your support of the new Kitchen God competition. First, I will introduce the rules of this Kitchen God competition and all our current arrangements so that everyone can enjoy the viewing. For this Kitchen God competition, we have specially invited several seniors from the culinary world to be judges, and only they have the qualifications to determine the final Kitchen God. We are honored to have Master Ming Xiu, the Divine Chef; Master Na Yan, the Spiritual Chef; Master Zi Xiu, the Humpback Chef; Master Tian Jiu, the Fiery Chef; and Master Zha Ji, the Ghost Chef, who has been absent from the culinary world for many years, once dominated the culinary world, and has won the Kitchen God competition many times.\" As he spoke the last five words, the host deliberately raised his voice, and the entire venue was in an uproar.\n\nBefore the start of this Kitchen God competition, in order to enhance the viewing experience and make the audience more professional, the Kitchen God Association specially posted the champions of the top ten Kitchen God competitions and their characteristics, along with detailed introductions of the abilities of these past Kitchen Gods and their contributions to the culinary world. In these introductions of the top ten sessions, the most frequently seen name by the public was Ghost Chef Zha Ji; he had won five championships out of ten sessions! Zha Ji was universally regarded in the culinary world as a once-in-a-generation prodigy, and it was unlikely anyone in the future would be able to surpass him. It was only after Xiao Tian's Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand appeared that the elders of the culinary world believed a genius comparable to Zha Ji had emerged. At this moment, hearing the host announce that Ghost Chef Zha Ji had arrived at the competition venue, how could these spectators not be surprised? Their gazes fell upon a long VIP seating area behind the main competition stage where the judges were seated. They were searching, searching for who exactly was Ghost Chef Zha Ji.\n\nThe five former Kitchen Gods all stood up from their seats. Zha Ji had arrived a few days earlier. This Kitchen God competition had a total of ten judges. In addition to the five Kitchen Gods, there were five elder masters from the culinary world. Although Zha Ji had been in hiding for many years, he still stood in the center of the five Kitchen Gods.\n\n\"Good, we thank all the Kitchen Gods for gracing us with their presence. Their arrival will surely make this Kitchen God competition shine upon Yangguang.\"\n\nEnthusiastic applause echoed throughout the entire square, and every spectator was shouting and cheering. The five Kitchen Gods waved to the audience. Except for Zha Ji in the middle, who appeared to be a middle-aged man, the other four Kitchen Gods looked aged.\n\nAfter the applause subsided, the host continued, \"This competition is the same as in previous years. All contestants will compete on the same stage. The biggest highlight of the Kitchen God competition is that within one day, the ownership of the Kitchen God title will be decided. In the morning, over a hundred chefs will compete simultaneously, divided into five categories: cold dishes, hot dishes, soups, dim sum, and special culinary skills. Every participating chef must go through these five competitions. After passing the evaluations for each category, they will then enter the final round. Only ten people can enter the final round. Five of these ten people are the single-session champions of the five categories, and the other five spots will be selected from the overall highest scores of the five categories, excluding the five champions. The final ten will then compete in the finals to determine the rankings. When conducting the finals, the ten finalists will also have to make cold dishes, hot dishes, soups, dim sum, and special culinary skills. After a comprehensive evaluation, the rankings will be determined by scores. There is a strict condition: if the final overall champion does not win any of the five single-session championships, then even though they are the winner, they cannot be awarded the title of Kitchen God. After all, without an outstanding skill in one area, how can one be called a Kitchen God? Of course, the number of finalists is not necessarily ten. If the same person wins two single-session championships, the number of finalists will naturally decrease by one, and so on. However, since the Kitchen God competition began, no one has ever been able to win all five single-session championships. If that happens, the final round will be unnecessary. The first rule of the Kitchen God competition is that if a culinary genius emerges who can win all five single-session championships, then the finals will be canceled, and they will be awarded the title of Saint Kitchen God.\"\n\nWhile the host was announcing the competition rules, the VIP seating area was also not calm. \"Old Zha Ji, come on, tell us honestly, what have you been doing all these years? We've all gotten old, but you're still the same as before!\" the Humpback Chef said, glaring at Zha Ji with envious eyes.\n\nZha Ji chuckled and said, \"Humpback, are you still as lecherous as before? I reckon you're already impotent.\"\n\nHumpback Chef Zi Xiu angrily retorted, \"You're the one who's impotent! You old immortal, you disappeared for over twenty years, and you come back to mock me.\"\n\nSpiritual Chef Na Yan smiled and said, \"He didn't mean to mock you. It's just that you've been lecherous from childhood to old age and haven't changed at all. However, I think your skills aren't as high as Zha Ji's. Look how well he's maintained himself. We've all gotten old, but he's retained his youth. Moreover, he's already this old and can still have children. We have no choice but to admire him!\"\n\nThe gazes of several Kitchen Gods couldn't help but fall on Bing Jie, who was not far away. Seeing her slightly protruding belly, their eyes were filled with envy. Bing Jie's pretty face turned slightly red, and she turned her head away from these old guys, but her heart was filled with sweetness. She herself never expected that at their age with Zha Ji, she would still have a child. Thinking of this, she couldn't help but secretly thank Nian Bing.\n\nHumpback Chef Zi Xiu's face suddenly broke into a smile, and he leaned close to Zha Ji's ear and whispered, \"Brother, teach me, how did you do it? You know, although I've had countless women in my life, I just don't have any children. This is my greatest pain.\"\n\nZha Ji shrugged his shoulders and said proudly, \"Want to know? I'm not telling you. Weren't you just being so arrogant a moment ago?\"\n\nZi Xiu's old face turned red. \"We're all old brothers, you won't be so stingy, will you?\"\n\nZha Ji laughed and said, \"It's not me saying this, Humpback. You're already an old man. It's time to settle down and enjoy your retirement. You're still thinking about romantic matters all day, which is not what people our age should be doing.\"\n\nZi Xiu proudly declared, \"My greatest wish in life is to die on a woman's belly. Life is short, and living brilliantly is the most important thing. We absolutely cannot waste any time.\"\n\n\"Are you here to discuss women, or to watch the competition?\" a slightly deep voice sounded from the side. This person was sitting on Zha Ji's other side. He was wearing a purple robe and had a white beard. His eyes exuded a natural majesty. At this moment, he was frowning and looking at Zha Ji and the other two. Master Ming Xiu, the Divine Chef, who had been silent all along, quickly said, \"Let's watch the competition first, Old Lie. Don't lose your temper.\"\n\nZi Xiu snorted and said, \"Old Lie, if you want to disrupt the competition, just shout louder. Your bad temper, I don't know when you'll change it. We, a group of old brothers, haven't gotten together in so many years. I know that kid named Xiao Tian is your disciple, and now he's getting all the attention. Aren't you satisfied yet?\"\n\nFiery Chef Tian Jiu said indifferently, \"He's not my disciple yet. I don't acknowledge him. When he can defeat Old Zha Ji, maybe I'll acknowledge him.\"\n\nZha Ji chuckled and said, \"Me? I can't do it anymore. I've put down my culinary skills for many years. Let alone your excellent disciple, even any one of you is much stronger than me. I'm no longer at the age where I'm eager to win. I just want to live a few peaceful years, and after the child is born, be a good father. That's enough.\"\n\nFiery Chef Tian Jiu said coldly, \"Zha Ji, you've suppressed me my whole life. Damn it, it makes me angry just thinking about it. I don't care. If my disciple wins the title of Saint Kitchen God today, he'll have the qualification to challenge you, right? You must accept the challenge. Give me a chance for revenge.\"\n\nZha Ji chuckled and said, \"Tian Jiu, you still take winning and losing so seriously. Didn't you just deny it, and now you're saying he's your disciple? Saint Kitchen God, it's probably not that easy.\"\n\nFiery Chef Tian Jiu said, \"Are you counting on your disciple? I heard from Xiao Tian that your disciple is indeed very good, but I believe Xiao Tian will definitely be able to defeat him. Everything about us will absolutely not repeat itself in my disciple. Xiao Tian started learning cooking from me at the age of five, and it's been twenty years now. His effort is incomparable to anyone else.\"\n\nZha Ji shrugged his shoulders and said, \"I don't know where my unworthy disciple is now. I haven't even seen him participating in the competition. Perhaps Xiao Tian can really win first place in all five categories and obtain the title of Saint Kitchen God. However, even so, I will not accept his challenge. I'm old, I've lost my edge, I admit defeat, alright?\" Although he said it casually, he inwardly began to curse Nian Bing. The competition was about to start, but Nian Bing still hadn't appeared. He really didn't know what this kid was doing.\n\n\"You, Zha Ji, you've degenerated.\" The Fiery Chef's aura began to become somewhat unstable. The other Kitchen Gods knew that this was a sign of his bad temper about to erupt.\n\nJust then, Zha Ji took out a small gourd from his embrace and mysteriously handed it to Fiery Chef Tian Jiu, saying, \"Do you know what this is?\"\n\nThe Fiery Chef's nose twitched, but the gourd was clearly well-sealed, and he couldn't smell its contents. However, his eyes lit up, and he said eagerly, \"Is it wine?\"\n\nZha Ji chuckled and said, \"Your title of Fiery Chef not only comes from your temper, but also from your love of strong liquor. Unfortunately, this is not strong liquor, it's just ordinary wine. Are you interested?\"\n\nTian Jiu, who had been righteous just moments before, changed his expression as soon as he heard the word \"wine.\" He swallowed nervously and whispered, \"We are judges. It's probably not good to drink now.\"\n\nZha Ji suppressed a smile and said, \"Then you can pretend to be serious. We'll drink.\" As he spoke, he opened the wooden stopper of the gourd. Instantly, a rich aroma wafted out. Although the aroma was strong, it was not cloying; instead, it gave people a refreshing feeling.\n\nThe few Kitchen Gods were connoisseurs. Upon smelling the aroma, their eyes instantly revealed surprise. Humpback Chef Zi Xiu's eyes widened, and he sniffed his nose vigorously. \"Brother, you've been hiding all these years and brewing Hundred Flower Dew? Damn it, you're too amazing, you actually managed to create such an immortal brew. Hurry, let me try.\" Before his hand could reach out, another faster hand had already snatched the gourd, and it was Fiery Chef Tian Jiu. This Fiery Chef held the gourd as if it were a precious treasure and carefully brought it to his face. \"This, this is heavenly nectar! How can it be described as wine?\"\n\nThe Divine Chef didn't move, but the Humpback Chef and the Spiritual Chef stood up at the same time and lunged at the Fiery Chef, shouting slogans of sharing.\n\n\"No, I won't give it!\" Fiery Chef Tian Jiu, like a child, hugged the gourd to his chest and bent over to block the hands of the other two Kitchen Gods. Fortunately, the elders of the culinary world hadn't arrived yet, otherwise, who knows what they would think if they saw these Kitchen Gods fighting over something.\n\nWhile fending off the other two Kitchen Gods, Fiery Chef Tian Jiu said, \"Zha Ji, you name your price. I must have this gourd of Hundred Flower Dew. You know I love wine the most, so how can such heavenly nectar fall into the hands of ordinary people?\"\n\n\"Who are you calling ordinary people?\" Zi Xiu and Na Yan said in unison, their attacking hands becoming even quicker.\n\nZha Ji chuckled, somewhat lewdly, and said, \"Then I want the cultivation method for the Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand. Will you give it?\"\n\nZi Xiu and Na Yan were stunned for a moment and stopped their struggle. They were mostly just joking. If Fiery Chef Tian Jiu were truly willing to exchange the cultivation secret of the Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand for the Hundred Flower Dew, they would indeed have no reason to snatch it.\n\nFiery Chef Tian Jiu regained his composure and looked at Zha Ji, a hint of hesitation in his eyes. The cultivation method of the Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand was undoubtedly the most precious thing to him. However, the value of this gourd of Hundred Flower Dew was by no means lower than that of the Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand. They all knew the brewing method of Hundred Flower Dew, but none of them could brew this peerless heavenly nectar. Finding a hundred rare flowers and grasses was too difficult, and every step of the brewing process was extremely important. The aroma emanating from the gourd of Hundred Flower Dew was not only enough for a hundred flowers, but it was also evident that it was made from precious flowers as raw materials. As a Fiery Chef who had a lifelong passion for nothing but wine, how much he wished to possess this gourd of Hundred Flower Dew!\n\nSeeing Fiery Chef Tian Jiu hesitate, Zha Ji laughed heartily and said, \"Alright, I was just joking. It's no trouble to give you this gourd of Hundred Flower Dew. Come, come, everyone gets a share. We old brothers haven't seen each other for so many years, consider it a reunion gift.\" As he spoke, as if performing magic, he took out several gourds from his embrace one after another and handed them to the other three Kitchen Gods.",

    "content": "The four Divine Chefs were stunned. Although they all craved the Hundred Flower Dew, Cha Ji's gift was indeed a bit too generous. Seeing their hesitation, Cha Ji smiled and said, \"You don't need to thank me. For ordinary people, Hundred Flower Dew is a rare treasure, but I have quite a bit in stock. This wasn't brewed by me; I don't have that skill. It's all from my precious disciple showing filial piety. When he has free time, he makes some Hundred Flower Dew, and the taste is truly excellent.\"\n\nChef Tian Jiu's heart tightened. One must know that Hundred Flower Dew is not just a simple alcoholic beverage. When used in cooking, it can transform even ordinary food into something precious. If Nian Bing truly possessed Hundred Flower Dew, combined with the culinary skills inherited from the Ghost Chef lineage, it was by no means certain that Xiao Tian could defeat him. In terms of seasonings, the Ghost Chef lineage was always recognized as the strongest, and even those precious condiments like Ghost King Soy Sauce and Red Soul Vinegar were highly valued.\n\nAt this moment, the Culinary Competition had officially begun. Cha Ji's gaze fell upon the competition venue, constantly searching for Nian Bing's figure. However, Nian Bing still had not appeared even after Xiao Tian, positioned in the center of all the chefs, started cooking. Had something happened to his disciple? Cha Ji couldn't help but feel a bit anxious, but he also understood that in this world, there was probably no one who could pose a threat to his disciple.\n\nWhat was Nian Bing doing now? If Cha Ji knew, he would probably be so angry his nose would skew. He was currently sleeping soundly.\n\nNian Bing had arrived in Oran City early that morning. Considering Long Ling's pregnant condition, he immediately found an inn to stay. Having traveled, he was worried his wives might be tired, so he simply booked several rooms for everyone to rest first. In Nian Bing's understanding, the Divine Chef Competition was not scheduled to start until the next day. Little did he know that he had missed the Divine Chef Competition he had waited five long years for, all while sound asleep.\n\nEver since he no longer had to practice magic, Nian Bing thoroughly enjoyed the feeling of sleep. The peace and beauty of it could completely relax his nerves and also make him more spiritually attuned when practicing his culinary skills. Nian Bing slept until noon, waking up to stretch his body and sit up in bed. Sharing the room with him were Feng Nü and Lan Chen. Long Ling was the priority protection target, under the watch of Kao and Tian Xiang. Since Long Ling became pregnant, Nian Bing needed special permission even to get close to her, and excessive intimacy was forbidden.\n\n\"You're awake. Shouldn't you go register first?\" Feng Nü asked, smiling at her husband. After that battle years ago, Nian Bing's parents personally went to the Oran Empire to propose. After much discussion, the wedding was held in secret. After all, Nian Bing had too much contact with the high-ranking officials of the four great empires. If the wedding had been extravagant, it might have affected their stable lives in the future. Although Feng Nü was slightly displeased about sharing a husband with four other women, she had grown accustomed to this lifestyle and now found it livelier with more people around. Most importantly, Nian Bing's love for her had not diminished because of the others.\n\nNian Bing stretched and said, \"Then I'll go register first. You all don't need to go. I'll cook for you when I get back.\" Having grown accustomed to the dishes Nian Bing prepared, the ordinary food was long ignored by the eight women. Mu Jing and Luo Rou's reason for staying behind was precisely this, at least, on the surface.\n\nOpening the door to leave the room, Nian Bing stopped a passing waiter and asked, \"Do you know where the registration for the Divine Chef Competition is?\"\n\nThe waiter was taken aback. \"Registration? The Divine Chef Competition has already started. You can't register now.\"\n\nNian Bing's whole body trembled, and he exclaimed, \"What did you say? It has already started? Wasn't it tomorrow?\"\n\nThe waiter replied, \"No, you must have misremembered. It was clearly today.\"\n\nNian Bing's mind raced, and he immediately understood why he had misremembered. There was a time difference between the Ice Moon Empire and the Oran Empire. Although not significant, Qingfeng Zhai had informed him of the Divine Chef Competition's time based on the Ice Moon Empire's time. Xue Ji had specifically instructed him to arrive early, but he thought arriving the day before the competition would suffice. No, he couldn't have missed the competition he had waited five years for?\n\nNian Bing was in a hurry and quickly returned to the room to inform Feng Nü. He then left alone. An ability he hadn't used in a long time was once again displayed. Under the control of his spatial abilities, he vanished directly from his room.\n\nFeng Nü and Lan Chen were also surprised when Nian Bing told them he had missed the time. The two women smiled wryly and hurried to the next room to call the others.\n\nThe Divine Chef Competition was in full swing. By noon, the judging for the morning's competitions had concluded. Xiao Tian had completed the entire competition with his nearly flawless skills, but his heart was filled with disappointment. For the second time in five years, he had come to participate in the Divine Chef Competition, yet he still hadn't seen Nian Bing.\n\nOn the judging panel, Cha Ji's expression was rather unpleasant. Nian Bing's absence from the competition made him somewhat annoyed. What on earth was this brat up to? The competition was already over. Had he given up the idea of coming to the Divine Chef Competition? Or was he afraid of embarrassing him by not being able to match Xiao Tian?\n\nThe competition had indeed concluded. In the preliminary rounds, each chef had completed five categories: cold dishes, hot dishes, soup, dim sum, and special culinary techniques. Although the Ghost Chef Cha Ji was unwilling to admit it, none of the most outstanding chefs from all the countries present could even slightly contend with Xiao Tian's prominence. Xiao Tian, with his Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand, combined with years of honed culinary skills, received the praise of all the judges. They unanimously agreed that in any of the competition categories, there was no chef who could rival Xiao Tian. Today, five years later, Xiao Tian's culinary skills had become even more mature. The five single-category championships represented the emergence of a Sacred Divine Chef, the first Sacred Divine Chef in the history of the culinary world.\n\nChef Tian Jiu looked at Cha Ji triumphantly. \"What do you say? Does my disciple now have the qualification to challenge you? You can't deny his excellence.\"\n\nAlthough the Ghost Chef Cha Ji's culinary skills had deteriorated significantly due to years of severed hand tendons, and he had only recovered some in the past two years, in terms of foresight, no one in the entire culinary world could match him. Cha Ji clearly saw that Xiao Tian's culinary skills had reached a state of perfect harmony and fluidity. Even in his prime, he might not have been able to match him. Cha Ji was unsure of the level Nian Bing's culinary skills had reached. He also hesitated. Even if Nian Bing had truly come, he might not be able to match Xiao Tian's culinary skills. Xiao Tian's culinary skills were the pinnacle of balance. In every competition category, he could create delicacies that astonished everyone. Could it be that he really had to compete with him? Even with Hundred Flower Dew, it was unlikely he could win against him now.\n\nSeeing Cha Ji remain silent, Chef Tian Jiu felt even more elated. The pressure and suppression he had endured from Cha Ji for many years seemed to dissipate in this moment.\n\nOn the stage originally designated for the final duel, the host, with his somewhat elevated voice, exclaimed excitedly, \"Distinguished audience, today, at this very Divine Chef Competition, you have all witnessed the miraculous performance of Chef Xiao Tian. I believe each and every one of you understands what this signifies. An unprecedented Sacred Divine Chef in the culinary world has been born at this culinary competition in our Oran Empire. Let us cheer for Chef Xiao Tian! Let us be proud of him! Next, we will invite His Majesty the great King of the Oran Empire to personally present the Golden Crown of the Divine Chef to Chef Xiao Tian.\"\n\nCheers erupted like surging ocean waves. Although they had only witnessed the morning's competition, Xiao Tian's culinary skills had earned the admiration of all the spectators present. They had never imagined that a person's culinary skills could reach such a level. Even just by watching, their stomachs seemed to have been maximally satisfied.\n\nXiao Tian ascended the high platform originally used for the final competition between the two contestants and waved to his audience. Yes, at this moment, all the spectators belonged only to him. However, there was a hint of forcedness in Xiao Tian's smile. Who could understand the disappointment in his heart?\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" A clear voice echoed out of nowhere. Without any warning, a slender figure suddenly appeared out of thin air beside Xiao Tian. Dressed in a simple white robe, he looked even more serene. His handsome face, coupled with his golden hair, instantly put the ordinary-looking Xiao Tian to shame. The sudden turn of events startled the host beside him, and the gazes of the audience turned to astonishment.\n\nCha Ji abruptly stood up from his seat. He had arrived. He had finally arrived. Feeling a surge of emotion, Cha Ji looked at his disciple standing proudly on the competition stage, unsure whether to be angry or happy. After all, the competition had already ended. Although he had arrived, he was late.\n\nNian Bing stood on the competition stage, his eyes seeming to focus only on Xiao Tian. Xiao Tian was also looking at him, their gazes meeting in mid-air. Mo Mo, watching her husband from below, suddenly noticed an unprecedented brilliance in her husband's eyes. Although Nian Bing had only just appeared, Mo Mo had already guessed her husband's thoughts. She was excited that her husband's long wait had finally yielded results. Regardless of victory or defeat, at least Xiao Tian's wish could finally be fulfilled.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm late.\" Nian Bing said awkwardly, his face flushing slightly.\n\nXiao Tian smiled and said, \"It doesn't matter. As long as we can meet, you are not late. I often tell myself that without defeating you, I will never be a true Divine Chef.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Although I knew I was late and missed the Divine Chef Competition, I still came. I'm not here for the honor of being the Divine Chef, but for you. I think we have the same ideas about some things. Let me experience your Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand.\"\n\nXiao Tian nodded, took the magic megaphone from the host, and said loudly, \"Please, everyone, be quiet for a moment. I have something to say. Standing beside me is Nian Bing, the disciple of the legendary Ghost Chef and known as the 'Prodigy'. Although I achieved good results in the preliminary rounds, this does not mean I have reached the pinnacle of the culinary world. In my heart, there has always been a rival I respect the most in the culinary world, and that is Nian Bing. Therefore, I would like today's Divine Chef Competition final to be between Nian Bing and me.\"\n\nThe host whispered, \"Master Xiao Tian, this seems to be against the rules?\"\n\nXiao Tian smiled faintly and said, \"If I cannot truly defeat Nian Bing, then the title of Divine Chef holds no meaning for me.\"\n\nThe host looked to the judges for help. At this moment, Chef Tian Jiu stood up and said loudly, \"I agree to this competition. Xiao Tian is right. If there is still an opponent on the continent he cannot defeat, then his title as Divine Chef is meaningless. Nian Bing, as the disciple of the Ghost Chef Cha Ji, is fully qualified to challenge Xiao Tian.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"The title of Divine Chef is not important to me. What I need is to seek the pinnacle of culinary art. I believe I have found the answer. Therefore, I would like to have a simple competition with the opponent I admire most. It will not delay everyone for too long. At the same time, I am willing to share my thoughts with every chef present, so that we can jointly promote culinary arts.\"\n\nA hint of surprise flashed in Xiao Tian's eyes as he looked at Nian Bing and said, \"You have found the pinnacle of culinary art? Then let us begin. I believe our competition doesn't need to be too complicated; making one dish each will be enough.\"\n\nNian Bing and Xiao Tian exchanged a knowing smile. \"Precisely. Please.\"\n\nAt this moment, the host had no reason to stop them and quickly moved aside. Nian Bing and Xiao Tian, destined rivals, looked at each other and then headed towards their exquisite metal cookware. Staff members immediately brought over various ingredients for cooking.\n\nNeither of them began their actions immediately. Their gazes fell upon the pile of ingredients. They seemed to be thinking and observing. Although a large number of commoners were watching, at this moment, the entire Royal Plaza was silent. Everyone was anticipating the start of this peak duel.\n\nThe ten judges naturally observed the most carefully. Seeing the focused expressions of Xiao Tian and Nian Bing, they couldn't help but nod silently. This kind of gaze is only possessed by the best chefs. Only by fully dedicating their spirits to the ingredients can they master the characteristics of each ingredient and produce the most delicious food.\n\nAfter a long period of observation, Nian Bing and Xiao Tian finally moved. They approached the ingredients almost simultaneously. Xiao Tian picked up flour, while Nian Bing picked up a tenderloin. Each of them took only this one item. When they returned to their cooking stations, they couldn't help but smile at each other, for they both understood that the other intended to showcase their perfect culinary skills using the simplest of ingredients. At their level, they no longer needed assistants, as the culinary skills of assistants could not match theirs. Even the slightest error could lead to flaws in their perfectly crafted dishes.\n\nAdding water to the flour, Xiao Tian's hands gently sank into the white flour, stirring it slowly with water. His movements were so gentle, and his slender hands, coated with flour, still looked so harmonious.",

    "content": "Nian Bing did not move. He simply placed the pork tenderloin flat on the kitchen counter in front of him. Lowering his head, he gazed at the tender, fresh meat, seemingly lost in thought.\n\nXiao Tian's movements remained unhurried, yet each action appeared perfectly harmonious. He gently stirred the flour in the basin in a clockwise direction. Gradually, the flour began to coalesce into a dough. Miraculously, not a speck of flour remained on Xiao Tian's hands. This manual skill alone was beyond the reach of ordinary chefs.\n\nXiao Tian's hands began to move faster. With a slight shake of his palms, he tossed the dough into the air. His hands, with remarkable dexterity, maneuvered the dough, causing it to spin rapidly. Just as it reached peak speed, his hands slowed back to their original pace. Palm after palm, he lightly patted the falling dough, sending it back into the air about a foot in front of him. As his hands struck, they would lightly press and glide across the dough. The indentation created by his press would immediately disappear, the dough returning to its round shape. The dough began to orbit Xiao Tian's body, and a faint white light gradually emanated from around him. The soft glow seemed to make the dough dance, each movement exquisitely beautiful. Those standing closer could clearly see that Xiao Tian's hands were no longer touching the dough; it would be gently repelled an inch away from his hands.\n\nOn the judges' panel, the esteemed Chef Tian Jiu proudly whispered, \"This is the highest realm of the Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand. Perfectly unified. The dough, in Xiao Tian's hands, is transformed by the Yin and Yang energies emanating from his hands, presenting the perfection of noodles. Applying the Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand to noodles is the best choice.\"\n\nNian Bing still hadn't moved. He continued to gaze at the tenderloin before him. With his head lowered, his clean hands rested upon the meat. If one were to observe his face from below, they would notice his expression constantly shifting, fluctuating between joy and sorrow.\n\nCha Ji seemed not to hear Chef Tian Jiu's words. His gaze remained fixed on his disciple, a faint smile gradually appearing on his face. Although Nian Bing appeared to have done nothing yet, the \"Ghost Chef,\" once the foremost genius in the culinary world, sensed a peculiar aura emanating from his disciple—an aura he had long pursued.\n\nXiao Tian's movements changed. His right hand suddenly extended forward, his left hand pulling back. The dough paused in front of him for a moment. Immediately after, he retracted both hands and pulled them apart, stretching the dough into a long strip. Xiao Tian's body began to rotate, his feet tracing an unusual and graceful path. With each rotation, the noodles in his hands seemed to bounce. It still appeared as a single long strip, but it was gradually separating.\n\nHis movements were still as gentle, but the gentle movements became faster. Gradually, onlookers could only see his spinning body transform into a giant ball of white light, his physical form no longer visible. Perfectly unified, the Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand had reached its apex under Xiao Tian's control.\n\nAt this very moment, Nian Bing finally moved. His right hand lightly brushed the tenderloin in front of him three times. Without using any kitchen utensils, the meat was divided into four segments.\n\nChef Tian Jiu asked Cha Ji beside him with some confusion, \"What, is your disciple not going to use your most skilled technique, the Dragon's Dance Blade Art?\"\n\nCha Ji smiled slightly and replied, \"Your disciple isn't using your proficient Sunset Blade Art either! The children have grown; they all have their own ideas. We just need to watch.\"\n\nA flash of divine light appeared in Nian Bing's eyes. The evenly separated four pieces of tenderloin floated into the air. With a light flick of Nian Bing's hands, four small flames appeared beneath the four pieces of tenderloin without warning. The brightness and size of the flames were identical, with no discernible difference. The four pieces of tenderloin began to rotate slowly.\n\nNian Bing did not move, his gaze shifting from the first piece of tenderloin to the last. The time he spent on each piece was the same. At this point, the judges finally noticed that Nian Bing's expression changed with each piece of tenderloin he observed, and the flames would undergo subtle changes as he watched.\n\nChef Zi Xiu, looking puzzled, remarked, \"Nian Bing isn't just planning to roast meat, is he? Even if he can use magic to give the roasted meat various flavors, it can't compare to Xiao Tian's Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand! You know, noodles made with the realm of perfect unity, while having only one flavor, encompass almost all flavor variations. That is the pinnacle of culinary art!\"\n\nCha Ji smiled and glanced at his wife. Bing Jie was also looking at him. It was because of simple roasted meat that Cha Ji had withdrawn from the culinary world back then. At that time, he also believed that roasted meat could not undergo significant changes, but in the end, he lost to that single piece of tenderloin. Cha Ji's eyes moistened slightly. He understood that his disciple intended to help him wash away the shame of his past failure, to rise again from where he had fallen.\n\nXiao Tian's movements suddenly stopped. The dough in his hands was gone, as it had already fallen into the boiling hot water that had just begun to bubble. Immediately after, Xiao Tian performed an action that astonished everyone: he plunged his hands into the boiling water and began to move them slowly.\n\nChef Tian Jiu sighed softly and said, \"Noodle making requires Yin-Yang harmony; boiling noodles is no different. Only then will they be the most perfect noodles.\"\n\nA faint aroma of meat gradually wafted from the tenderloin roasting over Nian Bing's four flames. The tenderloin had turned golden brown under the uniform roasting. Although Nian Bing seemed to have the upper hand in terms of aroma, all but Cha Ji, who still had faith in him, among the judges did not favor Nian Bing.\n\nThe competition progressed rapidly. When Nian Bing's four pieces of roasted meat were placed on plates, Xiao Tian's noodles had just been served in bowls. It was a simple bowl of noodles, without any toppings, only a bowl of light broth. Could noodles without seasoning be delicious? Of course not. The seasoning for Xiao Tian's bowl of noodles was his Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand.\n\nThe noodles were personally served to the judges by Xiao Tian. At this time, the number of judges had increased to eleven. The eleventh, the King of the Olan Empire, who was supposed to present the awards earlier.\n\nNian Bing walked behind Xiao Tian. His plate held only four simple pieces of golden-brown roasted meat. From the perspective of roasting meat, pure lean tenderloin was definitely not the best choice. Even ordinary chefs knew that only meat with a good balance of fat and lean was suitable for roasting. Yet, Nian Bing had chosen tenderloin, which was one of the reasons most judges were not optimistic about him.\n\nAt this moment, the eight women who had accompanied Nian Bing to Olan City had arrived below the competition stage. They were all watching quietly. As Nian Bing walked onto the judges' platform, he glanced at them. In his eyes, there was only one thing: confidence.\n\nA large bowl of noodles was evenly divided into eleven portions. Almost simultaneously, all the judges began to eat the noodles. The moment the noodles entered their mouths, everyone's expression changed drastically. Even Chef Tian Jiu, Xiao Tian's master, was no exception.\n\nEating a small bowl of noodles naturally didn't take long. However, if it could compel people to finish it entirely within the time of three breaths, disregarding the heat, it would be enough to prove the chef's skill.\n\nCha Ji smiled and nodded at Xiao Tian. \"A truly magnificent Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand. This is the most delicious noodle dish I have ever tasted. Your master is right; noodles made with Yin-Yang harmony, perfectly unified, possess infinite flavor extensions in this world. The lingering taste will likely sustain me for a whole day. I can only describe it as perfect. Evaluating culinary art should normally be done from the five aspects of color, aroma, taste, intent, and form. However, your bowl of noodles, although only embodying the aspect of taste, is already sufficient. It represents everything and surpasses everything. Tian Jiu! I am truly happy that you have taken such a fine disciple.\"\n\nChef Tian Jiu looked at Xiao Tian deeply. He said only one sentence, \"Regardless of the outcome, from this moment on, you are my formal disciple.\"\n\nOthers might have thought Chef Tian Jiu's remark about \"regardless of the outcome\" was merely polite, perhaps out of consideration for Cha Ji. However, Chef Tian Jiu himself knew that Nian Bing's roasted meat was far from ordinary. Even though he couldn't discern much from the surface, he understood from Cha Ji's confident expression that victory would not be easy for Xiao Tian.\n\nAfter respectfully saluting the judges, Xiao Tian stepped aside. Nian Bing moved to his original position and placed his plate on the table. A blue ethereal light suddenly appeared, dancing between his five fingers. In just an instant, all four pieces of meat were divided into twelve equal portions.\n\nZi Xiu asked with confusion, \"Are you having us each taste four pieces of meat? Do these four pieces of roasted meat have any differences?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly and replied, \"You'll know once you try.\"\n\nThe judges, with a sense of curiosity, began to taste. Xiao Tian watched intently. Besides the eleven judges, Nian Bing handed the last portion of the four small pieces of roasted meat to him, nodding gently.\n\nChef Tian Jiu, most eager, began to taste. He was very keen to know the source of Cha Ji's confidence. The moment the first piece of roasted meat entered his mouth, his expression froze for a moment, immediately followed by a gentle smile, as if he were quite excited. When he ate the second piece of roasted meat, his expression changed drastically, his brows furrowed as if he were suppressing his anger. Upon eating the third piece of roasted meat, his expression shifted from anger to sorrow, his eyes dimming considerably. After eating the last piece of roasted meat, Chef Tian Jiu suddenly burst into laughter.\n\nAll twelve people ate four pieces of roasted meat. The richness of the expressions on their faces was no less than that of the great Chef Tian Jiu, only the order of their joy and anger differed.\n\nNian Bing began to speak. His voice was very calm, yet it reached every person in the Olan Royal Plaza. \"The pinnacle of culinary art that I have explored can actually be summarized in two words: emotion. When any chef prepares dishes with different emotions, the taste of the dishes will change. When in a good mood, they might create delicacies, but when in a bad mood, the taste of the food will significantly decrease. For an ordinary chef to improve their culinary skills, controlling emotions is very important. As long as they learn to focus, their culinary skills will reach another level. Focus is a type of emotion, but it does not truly reveal the mystery of culinary art. Every emotion can be infused by the chef into their cooking. If the profundity of each emotion can be fully expressed, then even negative emotions can still result in delicious food. By infecting with emotion, by perceiving the emotions contained within all ingredients, and by perfecting these emotions under one's control, this is the true pinnacle of culinary art. While the Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand can imbue deliciousness with countless flavors, making it perfectly unified, it cannot include emotion. The four pieces of meat I roasted today, on the surface, were cooked using the exact same method. However, while roasting these four pieces of meat, I completed them under different emotional states. The tenderloin was infused with my emotions, and the roasting flames were also infected by my emotions. My emotions are their best seasoning. Therefore, these four pieces of meat respectively possess the four different emotional flavors of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. I infected the food, and the food in turn infected the person eating it. For me, this is enough.\"\n\nNian Bing's words left the commoners bewildered, but all the chefs fell into deep thought.\n\nXiao Tian seemed to be the first to awaken. He walked up to Nian Bing, a brilliant smile on his face. \"I lost. It turns out you've truly found what the pinnacle of culinary art is. Emotion, a remarkable concept.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"Perhaps this is not the true pinnacle, but if a chef can master the combination of their emotions, their culinary art will ascend to another realm. Emotion is the representative of this new realm. The roasted meat I made today may not be comparable to your noodles in taste, but what I want to convey is a new concept. I believe this should be of some help to you.\"\n\nXiao Tian nodded and said, \"Nian Bing, thank you. You've made me understand many things. The ancestor who created the Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand made his living making steamed buns. He achieved the most fragrant and sweet steamed buns with the Yin-Yang Harmony Tai Chi Hand. The secret manuscript records that when his beloved left him, the steamed buns he made turned bitter. From then on, his culinary career ended. Now I finally understand why: it's because he couldn't properly integrate his emotions with his culinary art. Your words have guided me into a new domain. The title of Culinary God belongs to you, and no one else.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at Cha Ji. Cha Ji was also looking at him. The master and disciple exchanged smiles, and everything was understood without words.\n\n…",

    "content": "Ten years later.\n\nIce Moon Empire, Peach Blossom Forest.\n\nTwo small figures quietly squeezed out from a gap in a hedge made of branches. They were two children, a boy and a girl. They were about the same height, both ** years old. The boy, although young, was handsome, with short blue hair that looked very spirited, and a hint of simple honesty in his eyebrows.\n\nThe girl was extremely beautiful, with blue hair a shade darker than the boy's. Most striking were her peculiar, intelligent, large eyes, looking around as if filled with wisdom.\n\n\"Ling Ji, let's be careful. Your fathers and mothers are too powerful. We absolutely cannot be discovered by them, or this adventure trip of ours will be ruined,\" the girl whispered in the boy's ear.\n\nThe boy, smelling a faint fragrance, blushed slightly. \"Jie Bing, do we really have to go? Fathers and mothers will worry.\"\n\nThe girl giggled and said, \"It's okay, didn't I leave them a note? Actually, what I'll miss the most is your father's cooking. I wonder if there's anything as delicious outside.\"\n\nThe boy seemed helpless. \"Since we have to go, let's hurry. When you've had enough fun, we can come back early.\"\n\nThe girl chuckled, \"Ling Ji, if we get into trouble, will you protect me?\"\n\nThe boy puffed out his chest and said, \"Of course, I am your fiancé! I, Rong Ling Ji, swear that no matter the circumstances, I will do my utmost to protect my fiancée, Zha Jie Bing, even if it costs my life.\"\n\nThe girl quickly covered the boy's mouth. \"Pah, pah, pah, don't say such unlucky things. Let's go quickly. It feels so good to be out playing. Oh, right, did you steal your father's knife like I asked you to? I heard knives have magic, which should help with your magic.\"\n\nThe boy gave a wry smile. \"I don't know if Dad will spank my bottom when we get back. Let's go, we won't be able to leave if they find us.\"\n\nThe two figures quietly slipped away, heading south.\n\nThey had barely left when two figures appeared out of thin air in the courtyard.\n\n\"Nian Bing, how can you manage your son? He's eloping with my daughter!\" Zha Ji said, looking at his disciple with annoyance.\n\nNian Bing gave a wry smile. \"Master, don't blame me. It was clearly your daughter who abducted my son. Ling Ji has always been very well-behaved since he was little. He wouldn't have had the guts himself.\"\n\nZha Ji glared with wide eyes. \"Then why didn't you let me stop them just now?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly. \"Why stop them? Let them go out and face some challenges, it might not be a bad thing. When I was six years old, I followed my father everywhere. By the time I was ten, I was already learning cooking from you. They will grow faster in society. These two little rascals! Master, I really didn't expect you to have such a mischievous daughter.\"\n\nZha Ji chuckled. \"Fortunately, your Ling Ji is as outstanding as I imagined, in every aspect, just like you were back then. In fact, on the surface, Ling Ji seems to listen to Jie Bing for everything, but Ling Ji is wise and plays the fool. Although he and Jie Bing are the same age, he has always treated Jie Bing like a sister, indulging her. But aren't you afraid for their safety?\"\n\nNian Bing retorted, \"You old man, you've hit the nail on the head. Ling Ji has plenty of tricks up his sleeve. Worried about their safety? Don't joke. Do you know what he stole from me before he left? He took my Demon Devourer Blade, a top-grade gem for summoning a Raging Golden Bull from Meow Meow, a death-exempt token from the Oran Empire from Luo Rou, the Phoenix Clan leader token from Feng Nu, the Golden Thorn token from the Langmu Empire from Mu Jing, and the Life Stone condensed by Kao after his life energy recovered. With your daughter's temper and the items my son took, it's more likely they'll be bullying others than being bullied.\"\n\n\"Holy cow, your son is ruthless! Taking his dad's stuff is truly a case of 'if it's not taken, it's a waste.' Fine, I haven't misjudged this kid. I'm going back to sleep. Anyway, if my daughter gets hurt out there, I'll hold you accountable.\"\n\nWatching his master's retreating back, Nian Bing couldn't help but show a faint smile. Just then, a gray shadow drifted away. Nian Bing glanced in the direction it left. \"Kaka is still worried. With him following, it's even safer. Who can compete with the future Dragon God and the Black Warrior Emperor? Well, I should be going too. Young Master is calling me to play mahjong, and it's not good to be late. I heard Light God Long Gong Wei, Rage God Lei Guan Huai, Death God A'dai, that guy called Sea Dragon the Lone Immortal, and Stellar God Tian Hen are all going. Young Master created the six of us, I wonder how this mahjong will be played? Could it be six-player mahjong? Heh heh, I want to compete with them and see who is the strongest among these six protagonists created by Young Master. I am the God of Emotion!\"",

    "content": "Bingyun struggled to stand, her eyes filled with rage and murderous intent. Countless blue elemental energies swirled around her body, unleashing themselves and sweeping furiously towards Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing was startled. He rolled on the spot, managing to get back on his feet. Red airflow rose around his body, barely blocking Bingyun's attack. \"I didn't do it on purpose!\"\n\n\"I'll kill you!\" Bingyun's beautiful face contorted slightly, her eyes bloodshot, like a lioness ready to devour. Bingyun's aura continued to surge as she began to chant her most powerful spell.\n\n\"Are you crazy?\" Hearing Bingyun's chant, Nian Bing knew something was wrong. If she managed to cast it, not only would he die, but Bingyun would likely perish too. Nian Bing didn't cherish Bingyun's life, but he absolutely didn't want her to die like this. He still needed to find out the whereabouts of his parents from her. Without hesitation, he lunged at Bingyun again, needing to interrupt the spell.\n\nSeveral ice cones shot out instantly. Unfortunately, without mental power control, the ice cones attacked in a scattered direction. Only one flew from the front, charging towards Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing could no longer afford to dodge. He shifted his body to avoid vital spots, grabbed Bingyun's shoulder with one hand, and covered her mouth with the other.\n\nThe ice cone accurately pierced Nian Bing's shoulder, but without mental power control, it didn't penetrate deeply. The pain in his hand followed closely behind his shoulder. Nian Bing cried out in pain, \"Why are you biting me?\"\n\nThe spell was considered interrupted. Nian Bing quickly picked up the Heaven-Proud Blade from the ground and held it to Bingyun's neck. Enduring the pain in his shoulder and hand, he said, \"Surrender. What's the point of continuing?\"\n\nTears streamed down Bingyun's pretty face. Since childhood, even the Ice and Snow Goddess's priestesses treated her like a precious jewel. Her pure body had never suffered such humiliation. How could she bear it? She abruptly closed her eyes, and her neck actually lunged towards the Heaven-Proud Blade.\n\nNian Bing, having trained as a chef for years, had incredibly fast reflexes. The moment he sensed something was wrong, he immediately retracted his Heaven-Proud Blade and struck Bingyun's neck, knocking her unconscious. \"Damn it, what a crazy woman.\" The entire competition finally concluded. The dramatic ending left everyone stunned. No one could have possibly imagined that two powerful mages would end the battle in such a manner.\n\nNian Bing placed Bingyun's body flat on the ground and quickly dispelled the magic circle on the ground. His mental power began to recover gradually. He first cast a healing spell on himself, which brought some relief.\n\nHe strode to the side of the spectator stands. He bowed slightly and said to Emperor Hua Tian, \"Your Majesty, the competition has concluded. I believe I should be the champion of this tournament, right?\"\n\nA hint of a smile appeared in Emperor Hua Tian's eyes. \"The National Rising Mage Competition concludes here. The champion is Mage Nian Bing, representing the Mage Guild of the Ice Moon Empire. Issue my command. Announce the rankings of this competition to the world. Prince Rong, please present the champion's prize to Mage Nian Bing.\"\n\nPrince Rong displayed a rare smile. He took the brocade box from the attendant beside him and nodded towards Nian Bing.\n\nNian Bing's heart relaxed. He strode off the competition stage and walked towards Prince Rong. Prince Rong handed the brocade box to him. \"Congratulations on winning the championship. From now on, you are the master of this Longevity Blade. The Longevity Blade needs blood to be sharpened; I believe you understand this principle.\"\n\nNian Bing bowed to Prince Rong and accepted the brocade box, storing it in his spatial ring. \"Thank you, Prince Rong.\"\n\nEmperor Hua Tian said, \"Alright, this year's competition has concluded. Tonight, a banquet will be held in the imperial palace to entertain the mages from various countries, and the prize money I promised will be awarded. You may all rest now.\"\n\nPrince Rong walked with Nian Bing towards the training hall. As they walked, Nian Bing asked in a low voice, \"When did Bingyun leave? How come I didn't know?\" He realized that after receiving the Longevity Blade, when he turned back to look for Bingyun, he found that she had already disappeared.\n\nPrince Rong chuckled and said, \"You're something else. You even thought of such a devious method. However, the magic circle you drew is truly magical; it can even break through innate domains. Bingyun woke up just as you were walking off the stage to accept your award. She seemed to glare at you fiercely before leaving the training hall without looking back. By the way, what did you do when you two were lying on the stage? It's not easy to make someone from the Ice God Tower so enraged!\"\n\nA bitter smile appeared on Nian Bing's face. \"A misunderstanding, it was just a misunderstanding.\"\n\n\"Rong Bing.\" A familiar voice sounded. The two brothers turned to see Yi Nuo running over excitedly. She first smiled slightly at Nian Bing, \"Congratulations, you won the championship this time.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, \"Sister-in-law, my elder brother gave it to me! Otherwise, the championship wouldn't have fallen to me.\"\n\nYi Nuo snorted, \"Don't give me that. I'm not blind. But even if our Rong Bing's magic isn't as good as yours, what does that matter? Rong Bing, you're being transferred, aren't you?\"\n\nRong Bing looked at her in surprise. \"How did you know?\" As soon as he said it, he realized his mistake, but it was too late to take it back.\n\nYi Nuo's eyes turned red, and she chided, \"You're leaving me?\"\n\nRong Bing frowned slightly. \"What does it have to do with whether I want you or not? Our marriage was bestowed by His Majesty, so how could I go against it? This transfer is just to gain more experience.\"\n\nYi Nuo's anger flared. \"Are you saying that if it weren't for my grandfather's order, you wouldn't marry me at all? Bing, you remember this!\" She turned and left.\n\nRong Bing was stunned for a moment, then snorted, \"Inexplicable. Women are so fickle.\"\n\nNian Bing patted Rong Bing's shoulder. \"Go chase after her. Just coax her a bit, and it'll be fine. Women need to be coaxed. Don't always be so cold to Sister-in-law; after all, you'll be together for a lifetime. I'm going back to see Feng Nu. I'll see you at the palace banquet tonight.\" Saying this, he left Rong Bing alone, as the matter here was over, and it was time to complete Yu Ruyan's orders.\n\nLeaving the imperial palace, he stepped onto the bustling streets. Taking a deep breath, he felt a lot more relaxed. He glanced back at the imperial palace. Whether Feng Nu was Yu Ruyan's daughter or not, he would not attend the banquet tonight. It was time to leave. He would fulfill what he promised Prince Rong, but he didn't want to stay here any longer. From Emperor Hua Tian's gaze towards him, Nian Bing understood many things. He needed freedom, not to serve any country. Last night, Prince Rong had asked him if he was willing to serve the Hua Rong Empire. Nian Bing refused. Prince Rong didn't say much, but he shared all his latest magical insights with Nian Bing and gave him a few more items. Although Prince Rong didn't say much, Nian Bing understood his meaning.\n\nThinking of leaving this prosperous city soon, Nian Bing's heart felt much lighter. His only concern now was Feng Nu's situation. If Feng Nu was truly Yu Ruyan's daughter, could she withstand such a drastic change?\n\nHe returned to the inn. Having stayed there for some time, the inn's staff recognized him. He greeted the staff and headed to his room. As he reached the door, Nian Bing immediately sensed something was wrong because the door was ajar, leaving a gap. Although he and Feng Nu didn't lock the door except at night, they also didn't have a habit of leaving it open. His heart tightened, and he quickly pushed the door open and entered.\n\nThe room was empty; Feng Nu was not there. Nian Bing's heart clenched. Just as he was about to go out and ask the staff, he noticed a piece of paper on the room's table.\n\nNian Bing snatched the paper. He saw a few lines of crooked writing, clearly not Feng Nu's handwriting. \"Kid, your name is Nian Bing, right? If you want your wife to live, exit the city through the North Gate and keep walking north. After about ten miles, you'll see a dense forest by the roadside. Pass through the forest, and there's a mountain. I'll be waiting for you at the foot of the mountain. I know you're part of the Rong family, but if you bring anyone with you, you'll likely only see your wife's corpse.\"\n\n\"Damn it.\" Nian Bing had never felt such rage. His mind was a chaotic mess. He fiercely tore the paper in his hand into pieces, his gaze flickering with complex emotions.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Nian Bing tried his best to calm down. Panicking was useless in this situation. He pulled over a chair and sat down, recalling the content of the paper. He immediately concluded that the other party was definitely not Feng Nu's tribesman. If Feng Nu had been taken by Elder Feng Kong, she wouldn't have left him a message. Moreover, capturing a martial saint-level Feng Nu so easily, if it were someone he knew, perhaps only his godmother Yu Ruyan and the Fire Dragon King Galo Mandis could achieve it. But how could Yu Ruyan be here? She was still busy with matters in the Oran Empire.\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel a chill. Who was it that captured Feng Nu? In terms of strength, he was even inferior to Feng Nu. The purpose of capturing Feng Nu seemed to be him. Could it be... could it be for his few top-grade magic blades?\n\nAt this thought, Nian Bing immediately recalled the contestants from various countries in this competition. Only they had seen these treasures of his. Indeed, these priceless treasures could easily arouse covetousness in others. He analyzed various possibilities, but the more he thought, the more confused he became. No matter what, he had to save Feng Nu, even if it meant wading through seas of fire and mountains of blades. Even if the other party was after his precious blades, he had to hand them over for Feng Nu.\n\nWith this in mind, Nian Bing took out the brocade box containing the Longevity Blade from his spatial ring. He first cast a seal in the room before opening the box. Under the effect of the seal, the blade's radiance was significantly weaker, but the abundant life aura revitalized Nian Bing. He didn't rush to take the blade out of the box. He bit his finger and carefully dripped his blood onto the yellow gem on the hilt.\n\nThe blood instantly merged into the gem. With a soft hum, the Longevity Blade detached from the brocade box and floated up. A yellow halo pulsed rhythmically, and an increasingly potent life aura, carrying a fresh scent, swept over Nian Bing's body.\n\nClosing his eyes, Nian Bing used his heart to feel this peerless treasure blade, allowing the life aura to nourish his body. It was an absolutely wondrous sensation. The surging life aura spread throughout his body, and every pore on his skin seemed to open, madly absorbing the immense life force brought by the Longevity Blade.\n\nThis was a fusion process. Previously, after obtaining each treasure blade, he had to go through a similar process, although the duration and experience were completely different. The previous few magic blades left the deepest impression on Nian Bing, naturally being the Holy Radiance Blade that pierced through his chest, though the memory only contained pain. However, the aura brought by the Longevity Blade during its fusion with his body was so marvelous. His bodily functions grew rapidly under the effect of the life aura. The Heavenly Radiance Pendant on his chest became scorching hot. The red and blue orbs of magic power within him were enveloped by a yellow halo. The magic power and physical strength lost due to the competition were rapidly recovering. Even his mental power was soaring with this life aura, approaching its optimal state.\n\nA flash of insight crossed his mind. Nian Bing seemed to understand something. With a guiding motion of his hands, the Morning Dew Blade and the Straight Sun Blade appeared in his hands first. He stood up, and with a flash of light, the two blades outlined a triangular halo, forming the Ice and Fire Co-Source Hexagram Seal on the ground. Nian Bing inserted the Morning Dew and Straight Sun into the center of the hexagram and then continuously summoned magic blades from his spatial ring.\n\nThe entire room was filled with the aura of magic, and one could even hear the excited chirping of magic elements of all types. Dense magical elements continuously cleansed Nian Bing's body. He stood before the Morning Dew and Straight Sun, allowing the magic blades to absorb their respective elemental magic. Rays of halo nourished his body, and the Ice and Fire Co-Source magic power within him recovered quickly. At this moment, his mind was exceptionally clear. Although his eyes were closed, he could clearly feel everything happening around his body.\n\nWith a faint smile, Nian Bing suddenly opened his eyes, a fierce cold light gleaming within them. At this point, the Holy Radiance Blade, the Demon Devour Blade, the Heaven-Proud Blade, and the Xuanji Blade were all inserted around the magic array. Six-colored lights intermingled, but they repelled the radiance released by the Longevity Blade in the air.\n\nRecommending a good new work, \"Dog God,\" which is updated stably and of decent quality.

    "title": "The evolution of the seven swords of the same origin of ice and fire (Part 2)",
    "content": "Stretching out his firm right hand, Nian Bing grasped the hilt of the Changsheng Blade. The yellow gem on the hilt suddenly brightened, and an unusually strong life aura surged forth, sweeping over Nian Bing's body. Xiaoxiusai.\n\nWith a loud shout, Bing abruptly turned the blade's head, knelt on one knee, and placed the Changsheng Blade on the edge of the hexagram.\n\nThe six-colored magical power instantly turned into seven colors, and at the same time, the aura of magic underwent a drastic transformation. Everything in the room, previously clearly visible, became distorted. The seven-colored light continuously intertwined in the air, while Nian Bing's mental power also divided into seven streams, each merging into a stream of light. Seven different energies, emitting seven powerful auras, clashed with each other, compressing each other. With the addition of the life aura to the original six energies, everything became different.\n\nThe ice and fire dual-source magical power within his body began to fluctuate violently. The red and blue lights, which had been calmly stagnating in his chest and abdomen, began to change under the influence of the external magical aura. The red and blue lights in Nian Bing's body gradually drew closer. At this moment, Nian Bing's mental power, due to involuntary dispersion, had lost control over them.\n\nA sudden sensation flashed by. As a dual-source ice and fire magician, Nian Bing naturally knew what would happen when ice and fire collided without control. With the intensity of the magical power in his body, if it wasn't assimilated and controlled by him, once they came into contact, let alone one him, even two or a hundred of him would likely turn to ash.\n\nThinking of this, Nian Bing's heart was filled with fear. However, he had no way to change the current situation. He desperately tried to condense his mental power to stop the collision of ice and fire, but the auras released by the seven magical blades outside were each holding onto one of his streams of mental power. The immense suction prevented him from withdrawing his mental power to save himself.\n\nThe red, representing fire, and the blue, representing ice, seemed to deliberately torment Nian Bing. Although they were constantly approaching each other, their speed of approach was very slow, as if to grind away at Nian Bing's will with pressure.\n\nNian Bing's focus was entirely on the dual-source ice and fire magical power within his body. He did not notice that the seven-colored magical elements outside his body were no longer as chaotic as they were at the beginning. They began to rotate, and the seven-colored magical power formed an organically combined entity. The halo distribution gradually became uniform, and Nian Bing's body was at the center of this magical element vortex. The entire vortex, driven by the blue and red lights, continuously encroached upon his body. The clothes on Nian Bing's body disappeared into dust unconsciously. To be precise, within a diameter of half a zhang, except for the hexagram protecting the ground, everything else disappeared. The table was eroded with an arc-shaped notch, and the bed had a corner shaved off by the magical elements.\n\nSweat streamed down Nian Bing's forehead, but it was quickly evaporated. The red and blue light spheres within his body continued to approach each other, and the shadow of death pervaded Nian Bing's mind. However, no matter how hard he tried, his body had entered a sealed state. He could only watch those energies approach, helpless.\n\nThe red and blue lights grew stronger and stronger. Nian Bing was already in despair, with no other thoughts arising in his mind. Xiaoxiusai. All he could think of was death. He didn't want to die; there were too many things waiting for him to do. But in this situation, what could he do? He could only wait. Wait for his body to perish in the explosion of ice and fire.\n\nIt felt like a hundred years had passed. Finally, the two colored lights drew close, only a hair's breadth away from collision. At this moment, Nian Bing's spirit was on the verge of collapse, but he was still desperately calling out to his mental power, hoping for a miracle.\n\nDid a miracle happen? No. His mental power was completely drained outside, unable to prevent the arrival of this final moment.\n\nLightning-like ripples appeared around the red and blue light spheres. As the two colored spheres touched, Nian Bing suddenly felt a strange sensation, neither ice nor fire, but a feeling of void.\n\nSuddenly, a transparent space without any color appeared between the two colored spheres. It was indeed a transparent space without any color, but one could not see anything else through it. In a strange sensation, the two colored spheres seemed to be drawn into this void space. The forms of both spheres changed. They were no longer circular but took on shapes like fish, slowly rotating around that void. No matter how the blue and red collided, not a ripple was stirred, as if they were meant to be one.\n\nBefore Nian Bing could breathe a sigh of relief, his entire body suddenly trembled. He felt a disturbance at the center of his eyebrows. In the next moment, a surge of magical energy rushed in, like a hundred rivers flowing into the sea, directly heading for a void point between his chest and abdomen.\n\nIf Nian Bing could see the outside world at this moment, he would be surprised to find that the seven-colored light that had been rotating around his body had all risen. The tip of the vortex was at his brow, and the energy within the entire vortex continuously poured in, while the external energy gradually decreased.\n\nUnder the impact of the ribbon-like energy, the void caused the surrounding ice and fire energy to rotate even faster. Gradually, streaks of light flashed, and the ice and fire energy reconverted into two spheres, but this time, the feeling was not of energy, but of substance.\n\nThe red and blue spheres, now like solid objects, clung to the nail-sized void in the center and rotated rapidly. Around the rotating red and blue light, five light spots gradually appeared, five rotating light specks. Their colors were cyan, gold. The five spheres were clearly much smaller than the original ice and fire energy spheres, but they also felt substantial.\n\nNian Bing had no idea what had happened. He was somewhat dazed by the strange changes within his body. The five small spheres slowly grew larger with the continuous influx of external energy, but their rotation speed remained slow, much slower than the ice and fire energy spheres at the core.\n\nFinally, Nian Bing's body trembled again, and the input of external energy finally ended. He was surprised to find that he could see everything outside, not through his eyes, nor through his mental power returning to his body, but from the center of his brow, as if he had grown a third eye.\n\nA cool sensation, like being enlightened, came from the center of his brow. Nian Bing discovered that looking outwards from his brow, everything around him seemed clearer. He could even see the patterns on objects and clearly perceive the speed and traces of the energy fluctuations on his magical blades. It was truly like an eye, a strange eye.\n\nAt this moment, his mental power surged through his body like a tide, madly pouring into the void space in the center of the two colored light masses. At this moment, Nian Bing's mind fell into a brief blankness, as if everything had disappeared.\n\nWhen he regained consciousness, he found that everything had changed. The two solid-like colored spheres were touching and rotating slowly, and the void space in the middle had disappeared. The other five smaller spheres continued to rotate slowly around the red and blue spheres, and Nian Bing had regained control of his body. Just as he was about to get up, he was surprised to find something new in his mind. Upon careful examination, he was shocked to see that it was a transparent sphere, or rather, a transparent sphere formed from the previous void space.\n\nThe glass-like sphere quietly rested at the center of his brow, truly like an eye that could see through everything in the world. Unfortunately, due to the transparent sphere, Nian Bing's view of the outside world from his brow had become distorted and blurry. However, what excited Nian Bing was that he found his brain had become incredibly clear. Various magical knowledge flashed through his mind. Problems that were previously incomprehensible were logically solved, and even the process of understanding was clearly imprinted in his mind.\n\nHis mental power seemed to have disappeared, but Nian Bing found that no matter what kind of magical element it was, as long as he thought of it, he would immediately feel a sense of connection, as if it were flesh and blood. Especially the transparent sphere at the center of his brow, when he wanted to control magical power, it would emit a faint radiance. Nian Bing boldly speculated, could this transparent sphere be condensed from his mental power? And why was his brain so clear?\n\nHe slowly opened his eyes and saw his naked body. To his surprise, although he had sweated profusely earlier, his body was as clean as an infant's, with delicate skin radiating a healthy pink color. There was a strange feeling all over his body. With a thought, his body actually floated off the ground. At this moment, all he could think of were four words: rebirth.\n\nThe seven magical blades were still inserted there, but the seven-colored gemstones on their hilts had become somewhat dim. Nian Bing raised his left hand, about to put them into his spatial ring, when he was surprised to find that his spatial ring had also changed. The silver ring had become transparent, like crystal, and the entire ring seemed to be attached to his hand. With just a thought, the seven blades on the ground simultaneously disappeared, and he clearly felt that the seven magical blades had been stored in the ring. With a slight movement of his hand, the crystal-like ring shone with seven-colored light. Although not very obvious, the dazzling feeling left a deep impression on Nian Bing.\n\nWhat was happening? What exactly had happened? Nian Bing was somewhat bewildered, but he vaguely felt that his dual-source ice and fire magic had improved. With a thought, he raised his right hand, and a wind blade quietly appeared. The cyan wind blade was so clear. With a flick of his finger, it had already embedded itself in the wall, leaving a deep mark.\n\nThe joy in his heart was hard to conceal. Without the Aotian Blade, he could still use wind magic. Although it was just a momentary cast of a second-tier wind blade, it was a good start! Regardless of what had happened, his strength had definitely improved. To be able to use wind magic without using magical blades, had he truly become an all-element magician? Thinking of this, Nian Bing conducted several more experiments. As he had predicted, the seven elements of magic all appeared in his hands. However, when he used ice and fire magic instantaneously, the feeling was completely different. It was not only a magical power connected by flesh and blood, but also much stronger in power and control than the other five elements.\n\nHis clear mind accurately helped Nian Bing analyze the problem. He vaguely understood that it was precisely his dual-source ice and fire magical power, gathered by the seven magical blades, that had caused this mutation. Although he could now use seven elements of magic, fundamentally, he was still a dual-source ice and fire magician. Ice and fire were his roots, and the other five elements were built on this foundation. The seven solid-like magical spheres, although small in volume, were interconnected. Everything originated from and returned to the dual-source ice and fire magical power.\n\nAt the same time, Nian Bing also understood that his strength had not fundamentally improved, only the form of energy had changed, paving the way for his future cultivation. It was as if the form of magical power in his body was a small stream, and it was already filled with magical power. Now, the water in the stream had changed, condensed into a solid, and the narrow river channel had become a vast ocean. The benefits for his future development were undoubtedly immense. The only thing Nian Bing did not understand was the current form of his mental power. He could only feel that his mental power had condensed into the transparent sphere at the center of his brow, but the sensation of mental power was not as deep as before, and controlling magic seemed less easy than before.\n\nAfter sorting out all of this, Nian Bing smiled. He knew very well that the mutation of his magical power today was not just luck. More importantly, it was the benefit of his long-term cultivation. When quantitative change reached a certain level, qualitative change would naturally occur, and he had undergone a process of qualitative change today. Although Nian Bing had previously thought that his dual-source ice and fire magical power would eventually undergo a qualitative change, he did not expect it to happen so quickly. He knew that this qualitative change was absolutely inseparable from his seven peerless magical blades, which provided him with sufficient energy to produce such a change.\n\nAfter changing into a set of clothes, a comfortable feeling spread throughout his body. Everything that had happened to him was over. He immediately thought of Feng Nu. His originally relaxed brows furrowed. Should he seek help from Rong Bing? He couldn't trouble his brother anymore. Moreover, he didn't want to rely on the Rong family's power to do anything. Relying only on himself was the best choice.\n\nWith improved strength and a clear analysis, Nian Bing left the room without hesitation. He didn't leave through the door because the anxiety in his heart was so overwhelming that he couldn't wait. This time, he didn't use Blizzard; instead, he used the wind element's Wind Flight technique, floating out of the window and instantly ascending into the sky, heading north.\n\nRecommended a good new work, \"Dog God,\" with stable updates and good quality.

    "title": "Chapter 153: God's Descendancy-Snow Waterfall (Part 1)",
    "content": "Chapter 153: Divine Descent Technique (Snowfall - Part 1)\n\nYan Ji's location was simple; he was in the Imperial Palace. More precisely, he was currently beneath the Imperial Palace. There were over five hundred people with him, including dozens of experts protecting him and the five hundred Blood Guards provided by Marshal Xue Po.\n\nAt the forefront of the group was a colossal black body, resembling a small mountain. Despite its apparent clumsiness, it moved with astonishing speed, clearing earth and rock aside with its massive claws as it advanced. Upon this immense figure's back, a black humanoid figure sat quietly, holding a sword in his hand. It was an inconspicuous yet sinister-looking Blade of Darkness.\n\nYan Ji followed behind his subordinates, feeling significantly more at ease. He knew that as long as he could control everything within the Imperial Palace, the success of this operation would be straightforward. What he needed most now was a handwritten decree from his father, Emperor Yan Tiannan. He believed he would succeed. The five thousand elite troops already launching their attack were merely cannon fodder, intended to attract the formidable forces of the Imperial Guard. He had not deployed the fifty thousand members of the Ice Moon Guard, as he knew they were the key to stabilizing the situation, and the time to deploy them had not yet come.\n\nThe battle outside the Imperial Palace was undoubtedly fierce. The five thousand elite troops Yan Ji had painstakingly cultivated had all taken special drugs before the operation. These drugs could fully stimulate human potential and also instill a bloodthirsty craving. Although their strength could not compare to the Imperial Guard, their fearless charge caused significant trouble for the Royal Guard. If not for the substantial support of the Royal Magicians behind the Imperial Guard, they might not have been able to withstand the impact of these five thousand elite troops. After all, the three thousand most elite members of the Imperial Guard had already been led out of the palace by their commander, Rudolph.\n\nAlthough Yan Tiannan had planned meticulously, he was, after all, seriously ill, and oversights were inevitable. At the same time, he had not expected his own son to be so audacious as to directly send people into the Imperial Palace.\n\nInside the Imperial Palace, Nian Bing was still channeling his innate energy to Yan Tiannan. Although he was not directly involved in what was happening outside, he had complete control over everything occurring. The Shadow Puppets and the fifth-tier evolved Shadow Rats he was remotely controlling with his mental power were paving the way for Yan Ji underground. This was an unexpected force, a crucial element of this operation. The Imperial Guard, in order to defend against external invasion, would inevitably push outwards in full force, creating a void within the Imperial Palace, which Yan Ji could exploit.\n\nThe \"Change of Sky\" operation had three critical points. The first was how to breach the Imperial Palace. The second was located in the Fifth Prince's residence.\n\nIn the Fifth Prince's residence, upon receiving news of the impending Ice Snow Goddess Festival, Yan Yun felt a surge of excitement. He knew the day he had long anticipated was about to arrive. He had originally planned to lead his skilled subordinates directly to the Imperial Palace to await the event. However, that morning, three thousand people appeared outside his residence. Yan Yun was startled at first. But when he discovered they were from the Imperial Guard, sent by Yan Tiannan, the intelligent Yan Yun immediately understood his father's intentions. He did not rush, waiting in his chambers, anticipating the arrival of the Ice Snow Goddess Festival.\n\nNews of the sudden attack on the Imperial Palace quickly reached Yan Yun. Yan Yun was initially startled but soon calmed down. He sat on a chair in his room and laughed coldly, \"Big brother, are you too naive? To dare to directly attack the Imperial Palace, your courage is indeed immense. Even if most of the forces in Ice Moon City support you, no one would dare to rebel against the Empire for you. Do you think you can storm the Imperial Palace with just your own forces? Naive, truly naive.\"\n\nHis confidence in the Imperial Palace was not unfounded. The palace not only housed the Imperial Guard but was also divided into an outer and inner palace. Between the outer and inner palaces lay numerous traps, making it difficult for even top experts to pass through safely and infiltrate the inner palace. Let alone Yan Ji's forces, even if they had fifty thousand men, they would not pose a threat to the Imperial Palace in a short time. Although Yan Yun knew that the commander of the Ice Moon Guard had sided with the First Prince, he also knew that these fifty thousand men would not act rashly, as doing so would be a clear act of rebellion. Now, it was unlikely anyone would dare to openly rebel.\n\nAfter receiving the news of the impending Ice Snow Goddess Festival that morning, Yan Yun had already sent his subordinates to disseminate the information. At this point, it was no longer about patience; it was about acting. He believed that any intelligent person would understand what the arrival of the Ice Snow Goddess Festival signified. Who would dare to oppose the Ice Snow Goddess, who could single-handedly annihilate a hundred thousand troops? Not to mention the existence of the Ice God Tower. Therefore, Yan Yun was perfectly calm, merely waiting for the final moment to arrive.\n\nA soft knock sounded at the door. Without needing to ask, Yan Yun knew who it was. He smiled slightly and said, \"Caiyan, come in. Didn't I tell you, you never need to knock when you come to see me?\"\n\nThe door opened, and a tall woman entered the room, carrying a tray with a cup of tea. This woman was exceptionally well-proportioned, her tall stature complemented by her light blue hair, making her look exceptionally captivating. Her equally blue eyes exuded a gentle glow. She was not stunningly beautiful, but the elegance she emanated was intoxicating, like a pure lily quietly releasing its fragrance.\n\nCaiyan moved gracefully, approaching Yan Yun. She placed the tray down and handed the tea to Yan Yun, smiling softly. \"Courtesy must be observed; how can I not knock? Although Your Highness favors me, Caiyan cannot overstep.\"\n\nYan Yun smiled, \"Yan'er, do you know? What I like most is your observance of propriety. Come.\" He set the teacup aside and pulled Caiyan towards him, letting her sit on his lap. Whenever he held this alluring, delicate body, he felt a sense of fulfillment. Caiyan had been with him for three years. He had been through countless beauties, yet Caiyan alone had always remained by his side, staying in his residence. Caiyan's tolerance, gentleness, and shy demeanor always evoked deep affection in him. Caiyan had never asked him for anything, only quietly supported everything he did.\n\nCaiyan allowed Yan Yun's hands to wander over her body, a blush appearing on her delicate face. She nudged the teacup towards Yan Yun and said softly, \"Your Highness, you have been restless lately. I've made you a cup of ginseng tea, made with a century-old ginseng base, to replenish your energy. Drink it while it's hot.\"\n\nYan Yun's heart warmed. He took the teacup and said, \"You know me best. Only when I'm with you do I feel comfortable. Yan'er, today is the most important day of my life. As long as everything is successful, I will never treat you unfairly. Although you come from humble origins, I will at least bestow upon you the title of Imperial Consort and have you serve me daily.\"\n\nCaiyan meekly lowered her head. \"As long as Your Highness is well, Caiyan is happy. Caiyan has no other demands, only wishing to see Your Highness every day brings me satisfaction. I have never thought about titles.\"\n\nYan Yun opened the lid and took a sip of the tea. A rich aroma wafted into his nostrils. With the tea, a warm current spread throughout his body, immediately invigorating him. \"As expected of century-old ginseng, it's truly comforting to drink. Yan'er, rest assured, I will always keep you by my side, no matter what.\"\n\nCaiyan smiled slightly. \"Your Highness, does the ginseng tea taste good?\" There was a hint of strangeness in her smile.\n\nYan Yun slightly froze. Suddenly, a feeling of powerlessness swept through his entire body. He looked at Caiyan in shock. \"You...\" He had been extremely cautious during this period to guard against the First Prince's potential schemes, but he had never expected that the woman he trusted most would poison him.\n\nA glint flashed in Caiyan's eyes. Before Yan Yun could cry out, she dislocated his jaw, rendering the astute Fifth Prince capable only of making muffled sounds. \"Your Highness, you were still careless. I've been by your side for three years; wouldn't I make a move against you? Do you want to ask if I was sent by the First Prince? No, he is not capable of controlling me.\"\n\nA trace of sadness flickered in Yan Yun's eyes. With intense love, he gazed deeply at Caiyan. Caiyan maintained her charming smile. \"If you want to ask if I ever loved you, I can also answer: no, I have never loved you, nor can I ever love anyone. In your eyes, I am merely a weak woman with no power to even tie a chicken. In reality, with your strength, you might not even be my match in a head-on confrontation. I cultivate the Heart Method of Ruthlessness, making it impossible for me to feel love for anyone. I infiltrated your life solely to master all your secrets. After all, you are my first man, and so far, my only man. Let me tell you, I am actually a member of the Blood Lion Sect. Perhaps this name is unfamiliar to you, but our Blood Lion Sect has existed for thousands of years. The era of the Ice Moon Empire is about to change. It's a shame that despite your years of careful planning, you still won't ascend to the throne.\"\n\nWith a casual wave of her hand, she pressed down on Yan Yun's head. With a *poof*, Yan Yun's entire body convulsed violently, his head caved in completely, and blood spurted from his seven orifices. As shrewd as he was, he ultimately met such an end.\n\nCaiyan acted as if nothing had happened, picked up a nearby towel, wiped her hands, and slowly walked out of the room. Yan Yun had given instructions that no one was to disturb him without his permission, giving her ample time to leave.\n\nA violent roar, accompanied by surging magic elements, flattened a hill. The Ice Snow Goddess's eyes were filled with rage. The eight Martial Saints and three Archmagi surrounding her caused her considerable trouble. Particularly the magic from the three Archmagi prevented her from focusing on the Martial Saints and unleashing more destructive attacks. Even for a powerful mage like her, without sufficient time to chant spells, she could not unleash her strongest attacks.\n\nThe Grand Elder and others were also astonished. From the moment the Ice Snow Goddess landed until now, they had launched three waves of attacks. The sacred fighting energy unleashed by the eight Martial Saints in unison was absolutely terrifying. However, a strange golden light continuously emanated from the Ice Snow Goddess's right hand, repelling them one by one without any incantations.\n\nBoth sides were catching their breath, gathering their energy for the next attack. The Grand Elder kept his eyes fixed on the Ice Snow Goddess, fearing she might unleash her world-destroying Divine Descent Technique.\n\n\"Who exactly are you people? How dare you obstruct me here!\" The Ice Snow Goddess's voice was filled with coldness.\n\nThe Grand Elder smiled indifferently. \"The honored Priest naturally would not recognize us insignificant figures. You are the continent's strongest mage. Unfortunately, even the most powerful mage, without the time to chant spells, might not be able to display their full strength.\"\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess sneered, \"Do you truly believe so? Gathering so many experts, it seems you intend to take my life. Since that is the case, let me show you the power of the gods.\"\n\nThe Blood Lion Seven knew she was about to make her move. The seven had lived and cultivated together for years, sharing the same thoughts. Without a word, they simultaneously launched their attacks. Surging fighting energy and dazzling magic instantly intertwined into a vast net that enveloped the Ice Snow Goddess.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess stood there quietly, as if she saw nothing. Her right hand slowly extended forward. A burst of intense golden light erupted from a point below her chest, instantly spreading to every part of her body. The dense golden light contained no magical aura, but its pure energy appeared exceptionally peculiar. Simultaneously, a burst of light also erupted from her lower abdomen, but this light was silver. Combined with the peculiar golden light from her right hand, two golds and one silver intertwined in the air. The surrounding air suddenly became very cold, and the moisture in the air condensed into fine ice dust.\n\nThe Ice Snow Goddess said coldly, \"Who told you that mages cannot unleash powerful magic without incantations? Forbidden Ice Snow Goddess Dragon!\"\n\nWhite light appeared without any warning. The white light surged, and the first to suffer was the fire-elemental magic cast by the Fifth Elder. As the white light turned blue, it was completely nullified. That was a ninth-tier offensive magic! The three lights, two gold and one silver, condensed into a single point in the air, a white point. The point instantly erupted. Amidst the swirling blue light, the sound of a dragon's roar spread everywhere. The Ice Snow Goddess's body floated into the air again, and a colossal blue dragon appeared before her. It opened its massive mouth, and a breath of ice drifted out, engulfing the attacks of the Grand Elder and the others.\n\n!~！（.）",

    "content": "They were all unaware that the strange fruit, unrecognized even by Nian Bing, was a supreme tonic for strengthening the foundation and cultivating the origin, named the Purple Desire Fruit. For an ordinary person, it would only serve as a tonic, clearing impurities from the body. However, both of them had been diligently cultivating magic and possessed Innate Domains capable of absorbing primordial energy, meaning their bodies were already devoid of impurities. Under such circumstances, the Purple Desire Fruit fully unleashed its other effect, instantly bringing their ** to its peak, igniting humanity's most primal instincts.\n\nBing Yun's hazy gaze fixed upon Nian Bing, and Nian Bing's burning gaze was equally locked on her. Bing Yun moaned softly, \"Nian Bing, I, I feel so distressed, I...\" Panting replaced her words, her consciousness already muddled. At this moment, Nian Bing appeared even more handsome in her eyes, especially his masculine aura, which intoxicated her body and soul.\n\nNian Bing's mental power was far stronger than Bing Yun's. A sliver of clarity still remained in his mind, but upon hearing Bing Yun's call, his last trace of consciousness collapsed. Gazing at her long, shapely legs, he could not suppress the fire in his heart. With a low growl, he pounced, embracing Bing Yun's delicate body tightly on the thick fur cushion.\n\nTheir two burning bodies clung together, like heavenly thunder igniting earthly fire, spiraling out of control. Nian Bing deeply kissed Bing Yun's lips. But unlike last time, Bing Yun responded passionately. Their breaths intertwined, and in each other's eyes, there was only perfection. Men and women are naturally attracted to each other, and the intense physical stimulation quickly led them to shed their restraints. When Nian Bing fully touched Bing Yun's elastic breasts, he couldn't help but groan, holding her tightly, and once again began to assault her jade-like, sculpted body. However, this time, although he had lost his reason, he was far less wild than before, fearing he might hurt the delicate girl in his arms.\n\nCaressing Bing Yun's burning body, his hot hands brought forth shivers wherever they went. They had not experienced this before, and everything seemed so clumsy, yet also so perfectly harmonious.\n\nHer moist petals, vivid and dripping, seemed to await the sun's nourishment, her skin flushed a faint red from excitement. Bing Yun's exquisite maidenly fragrance became unusually intense, while Nian Bing exuded a man's masculine aura. His sword, representing masculinity, stood erect, as hard as if it could destroy all obstacles. And the soft, moist petals parted slightly, as if awaiting masculinity's arrival.\n\n\"Ah—\" Bing Yun let out a moan mixed with a hint of pain, her hands and legs entwining Nian Bing's body tightly. The beautiful and sacred petals finally swallowed the corporeal masculinity.\n\nThe pain could not overshadow the satisfying fullness. Two tears slid down Bing Yun's cheeks. The chastity she had preserved for eighteen years was lost.\n\nRubbing the petals, intensely stimulating the pistil, Nian Bing's masculinity finally reached the heart of the flower. Their bodies fused together, no longer distinguishable. Their souls touched. Nian Bing did not move. That warm place gave him a sense of a weary bird returning to its nest. Every tremor from Bing Yun brought him immense joy.\n\nThe union of spirit and desire allowed them to feel each other's inner world. The emotions hidden deep within their hearts could no longer be restrained, and they moved. Nian Bing's movements were slow at first, but each thrust was exceptionally firm. They both moaned softly, and as pleasure continued to rise, Nian Bing's movements became faster, while Bing Yun's moans seemed to acquire a hint of crying.\n\nThe coldness of the outside world was in stark contrast to the warmth of the cave. In the cold early winter of the Ice Moon Empire, Nian Bing and Bing Yun experienced the most important moment of their lives, offering each other their virginity.\n\nWaves of pleasure rose and fell, each descent a prelude to the next. They didn't know how much time had passed. When Nian Bing finally moistened Bing Yun's beautiful flower heart with his spring rain for the last time, they both let out long, satisfied cries.\n\nAn extremely cold airflow was transmitted into his body along Nian Bing's virile root. He felt his entire body shake, and the burning sensation within him gradually subsided. Instead of being weakened by excessive fatigue, his spirit became even more vigorous than before. He could clearly perceive everything around him; even the slightest fluctuation of hair could not escape his mental power.\n\nBing Yun suddenly held Nian Bing tightly, pain etched on her pretty face. Her delicate body convulsed violently. Nian Bing held her close. Now lucid, he didn't have time to think, only wanting to make Bing Yun more comfortable in his arms.\n\nHowever, as Nian Bing wrapped his arms around Bing Yun's jade-like back, he suddenly felt two hard, cold objects. At that moment, his body was still intimately connected with Bing Yun's. Startled, using his mental power, he brought their bodies afloat with wind element magic, changing their posture to standing. Bing Yun's elastic, slender legs remained wrapped around his waist. Nian Bing held her waist with one hand and supported her buttocks with the other. The change in posture made his masculinity penetrate deeper, and Bing Yun, in pain, couldn't help but let out a soft moan.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was puzzled and preparing to use light magic to treat her, a strange thing happened. Bing Yun's originally hot body became cold, and her lower body contracted sharply. This caused Nian Bing's masculinity, which had been about to withdraw after ejaculation, to become erect again due to the strong stimulation. Bing Yun threw her head back and let out a clear phoenix cry. A pair of large, blue wings gracefully emerged from her back. As the huge wings spread, their moist feathers gradually stiffened, turning into wings that shimmered with a crystal-clear blue light.\n\nNian Bing was completely stunned. Bing Yun rested her head on his shoulder, panting, and her ice-blue hair began to change, gradually shifting from its original ice-blue to dark green.\n\nBing Yun tightly hugged Nian Bing's neck, her large wings enveloping their intimate bodies. She parted her cherry lips and murmured, \"Bing, love me.\"\n\nBing Yun's dreamlike voice reignited the lingering lust in Nian Bing's heart. He did not change his posture, remaining standing, gently tossing Bing Yun's delicate body. Their close union gradually propelled them to the peak of another climax.\n\nWhen everything finally calmed down, Nian Bing was deeply kissing Bing Yun's lips. Their panting gradually subsided, and the gaze in their eyes became clearer. Only Bing Yun's blue wings remained, their soft feathers gently brushing against Nian Bing's back. Neither of them spoke, not knowing what to say at this moment. They both guessed that the problem lay with the purple fruit, but everything had already happened.\n\nAfter a long while, Nian Bing hugged Bing Yun's delicate body tightly and said softly, \"Does it still hurt?\"\n\n\"En,\" Bing Yun lowered her head, burying it in Nian Bing's embrace, and replied softly. She no longer wanted to think about the future, only wishing to stay with Nian Bing like this.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Nian Bing sighed softly.\n\n\"It's not your fault this time, I was the one who took the 'poison',\" Bing Yun's voice was barely audible, but Nian Bing heard it clearly.\n\n\"Why did your hair change color, and what are these wings?\" Nian Bing asked, voicing his doubts.\n\nBing Yun gently shook her head and said, \"I don't know what's going on with the wings either. My hair was originally this color; it only turned ice-blue due to long-term cultivation of ice magic.\"\n\nEverything that had suddenly happened left them both bewildered. Neither knew what to do next, simply holding each other tightly, quietly savoring the moment of silence.\n\nJust then, a clear, long cry sounded from outside the cave. The sound, approaching from a distance, moved at an extremely rapid pace, and its target was clearly this cave. Nian Bing's heart skipped a beat, and he quickly released his arms around Bing Yun, leaped off the ground, and pulled on some clothes to put them on.\n\nBing Yun also woke up, her whole body trembling, and let out a low gasp.\n\n\"Don't move, I'll go out and take a look. It shouldn't be your master; this sounds like a battle qi cry. The person is very strong. Strange, why does it sound like they're heading directly towards us?\"\n\nAs he spoke, he tidied his clothes and walked towards the outside.\n\n\"Don't go,\" Bing Yun let out a low cry.\n\nNian Bing turned to look at Bing Yun, whose expression was somewhat flustered, and smiled, \"Don't worry, as long as it's not your master, I can handle it. You rest for a while, I'll be back soon.\"\n\nHe could now clearly feel his magical power moving harmoniously within him. His primordial energy seemed to have grown further through his union with Bing Yun.\n\nBefore Bing Yun could stop him again, Nian Bing had already floated out. With the sound of a large stone moving, he left the cave.\n\nBing Yun was completely stunned. She hadn't expected her design for Nian Bing to manifest at this moment. Her mind was in utter chaos. Without even dressing, she lay there blankly, accompanied only by the lingering warmth left by Nian Bing.\n\nExiting the cave, Nian Bing first cast a Wind Soaring spell on himself. He would not be careless when facing any enemy, especially since, judging by the cry, the approaching enemy was extremely powerful, at least a Martial Saint level expert. But he was confident in himself. With his recently advanced Heavenly Eye Domain, as long as the opponent did not reach the terrifying level of a Divine Master, he was confident he could handle them. It was just that he found it strange; why did this urgent cry sound so familiar? Could it not be an enemy?\n\nFrom afar, two agile figures, like leaping stars and pebbles, were flying rapidly in",

    "content": "“Mom, why did you suddenly come to the Ice Moon Empire? Did something happen?” Nian Bing asked tentatively.\n\nYu Ruyan sighed and said, “Nian Bing, do you remember Chenchen, who argued with you when we first met? Although Chenchen didn't inherit my Phoenix clan royal bloodline, due to some peculiarities of our Phoenix clan, we have a strong connection. Not long ago, I suddenly received a distress signal from Chenchen. Her signal was very urgent, and it seemed she was in great danger. As soon as I discovered this, I immediately rushed here with the Phoenix Maiden, day and night. Through our Phoenix clan bloodline, I just felt Chenchen was very close by. We’ll catch up later. Chenchen is in danger, and we must rescue her first. You come with us.” She was clearly very anxious, leaping up and shooting out like lightning. The Phoenix Maiden pulled Nian Bing’s hand and hurried to follow.\n\nAt this moment, Nian Bing’s mind was filled with nothing but fear, because he had thought of a possibility, a possibility that would make him feel eternally damned. He prayed that all of this was not true. But reality was, as always, cruel. Yu Ruyan’s destination was the very cave where he and Bing Yun had lived for ten days!\n\nAs soon as they reached the cave entrance, Yu Ruyan displayed her formidable power. Her right leg swept out, and silver battle qi surged forth. With a deafening roar, the large rock at the cave entrance was blasted into powder by her. The battle qi immediately expanded, forcing the dust outward and revealing the dark cave entrance. Without hesitation, Yu Ruyan, protected by her silver holy battle qi, rushed into the cave at the fastest speed.\n\nThe Phoenix Maiden, pulling Nian Bing, followed closely. When she saw the kitchenware that had not yet been put away at the cave entrance, she couldn't help but be stunned. She was too familiar with this kitchenware and looked at Nian Bing beside her with confusion. Just as she was about to ask, she heard Yu Ruyan’s exclamation, her heart tightening. She quickly pulled Nian Bing and rushed into the inner cave.\n\nWhen the Phoenix Maiden pulled Nian Bing into the inner cave, she immediately saw a shocking scene before her. The peerlessly beautiful Bing Yun lowered her head, not daring to look at Yu Ruyan. Her ice-blue wings protected her fair, naked body. The thick fur on the ground still held the scent of intimacy, especially the patch of bloodstain, which was so obvious.\n\n“Chenchen, Chenchen, you…” Yu Ruyan rushed forward a few steps and cupped Bing Yun’s delicate face.\n\nBing Yun’s beautiful face was filled with panic, her delicate body trembling slightly. Her rosy lips parted, “Mom—”\n\n*Boom—* In an instant, Nian Bing felt as if his brain had exploded. His most feared guess was finally confirmed: Bing Yun was Yu Ruyan’s daughter! It was the cute little girl who had argued with him on the official road. His mind went blank, and his thoughts took him back to a scene from many years ago.\n\n“Little pervert, who let you look at my mom like that?”\n\n“What are you doing? You’re not allowed to hug my mom.”\n\n“Chenchen, what are you doing?”\n\n“Mom, why is he calling you Mom! You’re only my mom.”\n\n“You’re not as cute as me. You’re so fat, you look like a ball. So ugly.”\n\n“Mom, how can you give him the Tianhua brand? I’ve asked you so many times, and you never gave it to me.”\n\n…\n\nAll the memories were so real. The little girl in the white dress, with dark green hair just past her ears, and a naive expression seemed to be right before his eyes. Bing Yun, Bing Yun was Chenchen.\n\nYu Ruyan stroked Bing Yun’s ice-blue wings and muttered to herself, “Chenchen, your royal feathers have awakened. So you really are the ice phoenix body that the Phoenix clan rarely encounters in a thousand years. No wonder your master said you were naturally ice-elemental and not suitable for learning fire-elemental battle qi with me.” Suddenly, she parted Bing Yun’s wings, lifted her fair left arm, and seeing the flawless jade arm, Yu Ruyan was greatly shocked. “Chenchen, where is your virginity mark? Who defiled you?”\n\nAnger, like flames, burned madly around Yu Ruyan’s body. A strong killing intent permeated the entire cave. Thinking of her daughter’s distress signal and everything before her, she didn’t need to think further; she concluded that her daughter had been raped.\n\nBing Yun trembled all over. She did not look up at Nian Bing, but lowered her head, her body trembling slightly as she wept, “Mom, please don’t ask. It’s all in the past.”\n\nThe Phoenix Maiden released Nian Bing’s already cold hand and took a step forward, crouching before Bing Yun. “Who is it? Chenchen, tell us who defiled you?”\n\nBing Yun looked up at the Phoenix Maiden. The Phoenix Maiden’s peerlessly beautiful face, no less stunning than her own, made her heart skip a beat. “You are…”\n\nYu Ruyan said, “She is your sister. Do you remember the sister I told you about? She’s not dead! Mom found her again, and our family can finally be reunited. Chenchen, quickly tell Mom who persecuted you. Mom doesn’t blame you; Mom will tear that bastard to pieces and avenge you.”\n\n“No, no…” Bing Yun shook her head forcefully, crystal-clear tears like water falling. Her delicate body trembled more violently. Her heart no longer held any hatred. As she climbed to peak after peak in the union of spirit and desire, all resentment disappeared. She did not blame Nian Bing; all of this was caused by her poisoning. Moreover, she felt no regret at all. Everything happened so naturally and ended naturally.\n\n“Chenchen, what’s wrong? Did that bastard do something to you? Don’t be afraid, Mom is here, and so is your master. No one can bully you anymore. Good girl, tell Mom, who exactly is it? Who?” By the end, the killing intent emanating from Yu Ruyan had become tangible. When she lost the Phoenix Maiden, after she had Lan Chen with Duke Lan Yu, she doted on her excessively. However, due to some special reasons, Lan Chen had to cultivate in the Ice God Tower and could only return home once a year. Yu Ruyan never expected that her most beloved daughter would be raped. Faced with this fact, she was almost heartbroken to the point of suffocation. Her body trembled, and her intense anger and killing intent caused her vast battle qi to surge.\n\nA long sigh echoed from behind Yu Ruyan and the Phoenix Maiden. “Mom, you don’t need to ask her. That person is me.”\n\nYu Ruyan and the Phoenix Maiden turned around abruptly. They saw Nian Bing looking at them calmly. With a flash, Yu Ruyan appeared before Nian Bing, her lips trembling. “You? Nian Bing, what did you say? Say it again?”\n\nNian Bing looked calmly at Yu Ruyan and the Phoenix Maiden. “The bastard you’re talking about is me. I defiled Bing Yun’s purity.”\n\nAlthough the Phoenix Maiden had guessed something when she saw the kitchenware upon entering the cave, she couldn’t bring herself to believe it. Now that Nian Bing had admitted it himself, the color drained from her face. She looked at Nian Bing, unable to say a word.\n\nWith a flash of light, Yu Ruyan was already in front of Nian Bing. She grabbed Nian Bing’s collar, trembling, “You? It’s you? How could it be you?”\n\nNian Bing took a deep breath. “Mom, it’s me. I brought Bing Yun here, and I…”\n\n“Don’t say anymore, don’t call me Mom. I don’t have a son like you.” Yu Ruyan, as if driven mad, threw Nian Bing away, sending him crashing heavily against the cave wall with a thud. Nian Bing did not resist. Yu Ruyan’s force was immense. Even with his dragon physique, he couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood, his entire body aching as if it were falling apart. After all, Yu Ruyan was an extremely powerful being, close to a Divine Master.\n\nThe Phoenix Maiden fell to her knees with a thud, tightly hugging Yu Ruyan’s leg, tears filling her pale, delicate face, weeping, “Mom, don’t!”\n\nYu Ruyan was overcome with rage and anger. “Phoenix Maiden, he raped your sister, your own sister! Why keep such a beast?” With a wave of her left hand, she struck the Phoenix Maiden’s shoulder, instantly restraining her eldest daughter. She understood the feelings between the Phoenix Maiden and Nian Bing very well and didn’t want the Phoenix Maiden to stop her. With a flash of light in her right hand, a silver sword formed from battle qi shot towards Nian Bing like lightning. However, despite her extreme rage, she still held back. The silver sword was aimed at Nian Bing’s right chest, not his heart. After all, without Nian Bing, she wouldn’t have recognized her eldest daughter, and a shred of hope lurked in her heart that all of this wasn’t true.\n\nNian Bing didn’t dodge at all. At such close range, even if he opened his Heavenly Eye domain to its maximum, he couldn’t block Yu Ruyan’s full force. Looking at the silver light that instantly magnified, he felt a sense of relief. When he learned that Bing Yun was Chenchen, he didn’t know how to face Yu Ruyan, let alone the Phoenix Maiden. Perhaps, only ending his own life would be the best explanation.\n\nJust as Nian Bing was ready to accept death calmly, a blue figure suddenly moved sideways like lightning, instantly blocking him.\n\nEven Bing Yun didn’t understand why she had such speed, but under intense fear, she actually achieved it. However, no matter how fast she was, she couldn’t completely block Nian Bing’s body. Yu Ruyan’s silver sword, originally aimed at Nian Bing’s right chest, pierced through her left chest, her heart, bringing with it a splash of bloody brilliance, and then passed through Nian Bing’s right chest. The immense penetrating power nailed them both to the wall.\n\n“Bing— Yun—”\n\n“Chen— Chen—”\n\nExclamations of shock rang out simultaneously. No one expected Bing Yun to make such a choice. Everything happened in a flash. The silver battle qi sword disappeared. Amidst the gushing blood, Bing Yun and Nian Bing’s bodies slid to the ground, pressed tightly against each other.\n\nAlthough Nian Bing’s injury was severe, it was not fatal. However, the silver battle qi sword had indeed pierced through Bing Yun’s chest. Yu Ruyan reacted extremely quickly, flashing before them. With two flashes of her right hand, she immediately sealed the wound on Bing Yun’s chest, stopping the blood flow. But at the same time, her heart sank to the bottom, because she clearly felt Bing Yun’s vitality rapidly draining due to the penetration of her heart. Having accidentally killed her daughter, Yu Ruyan’s mind buzzed, and she almost fainted. “Chenchen, what are you doing! You, you…”\n\nNian Bing struggled to sit up, ignoring his injuries, and tightly held Bing Yun in his arms. “Bing Yun, why are you so foolish? Why? It’s not worth it!”\n\nBing Yun’s face turned exceptionally pale. The blue wings on her back had already quietly retracted into her body. Although her heart had been pierced, she was sustained by her strong innate energy and did not die immediately. Looking at her mother, then at Nian Bing, a mournful smile appeared at the corner of her lips. “Perh… aps, this is… the best… ending… I… have already… lost… my… virginity…, only… this way… is… the best… way… to account… to… Master…. Mom…, please… don’t… blame… Nian… Bing…, I… don’t… blame… him… either…, he… didn’t… force… me…, it… was… my… own… willing…ness…, I… willingly… came… to be… with… him…. Mom…, Mom…, Mom…” Bing Yun’s breath grew weaker and weaker, her cold hands drooping powerlessly.\n\n“No—” Nian Bing roared in grief. “I’m the one who should die, Bing Yun, you must hold on.” As he spoke, he madly poured his innate energy into Bing Yun without reservation, forcefully protecting her collapsing heart, trying to pull her back from the brink of death.\n\nHowever, as the saying goes, medicine cannot cure a dying illness. With her heart’s function completely destroyed by holy battle qi, how could Bing Yun possibly live?\n\nBing Yun’s spirit improved somewhat with the support of her innate energy. She raised her hand, stroking Nian Bing’s face, and smiled, “Do… you know? Although we… were always… opponents, I… had… already… fallen… for you… without realizing… it, only… when… I was… filled… with fear… just now… did I… discover… all… of this. It’s a… pity, it’s… too… late… now. I… finally… understand… why… Senior… Sister… Bing Ling… betrayed… Master… because… of your… father…. Love, as… expected…, is… a… magical… power…. Take… good… care… of… yourself…, live… well…, promise… me.”\n\n“No, no, Bing Yun, you won’t die.” Nian Bing cried. He tightly held Bing Yun’s cold little hand, which was stroking his face, his heart filled with fear. Suddenly, he seemed to remember something and looked up at Yu Ruyan. “Mom, you are the Phoenix clan’s foremost expert, and Bing Yun is also your daughter. She should possess the Phoenix clan’s body. I know you must have some secret Phoenix clan techniques that can save her, right? You definitely can.” ( . )",

    "content": "As he spoke, he hugged Cao tightly and lowered his head, kissing her lips heavily.\n\nAt that moment, Cao's eyes were filled with surprise. She had forgotten to resist, allowing Nian Bing to kiss her lips.\n\nA cool sensation suddenly came to his mind, and Nian Bing found himself as if in another world. The pain in the Heavenly Eye Acupoint was gone. Above and below, he could only feel the fullness in his arms. It was a fullness indescribable by words, a real stimulation to his nerves. He was surprised to find that at this moment, he seemed to have regained some human feelings. The warmth of the lips he kissed was like the purest spring water, nourishing his body. This wonderful feeling was the first he had experienced since becoming a zombie. He didn't know why all this was happening, but the lips he kissed were constantly changing, sometimes as cold as snow, sometimes as hot as fire. In the constant alternation of ice and fire, entirely different currents continuously entered his body from these soft lips. Everything seemed to be changing. Nian Bing wanted to stop it all, but he found that arms as if carved from jade had already wrapped around his neck at some point. The wonderful feeling kept escalating with this kiss, and Nian Bing's consciousness was finally lost at this moment.\n\nNian Bing's kiss on Dark Heavenly Fragrance was, in a sense, somewhat mischievous. Dark Heavenly Fragrance was severely injured, which was his greatest opportunity, and he would never let it go. The moment Nian Bing fell into the lake, an extremely vast death energy enveloped his body. Although he was an undead, this death aura could not destroy him. However, his impure zombie body, when facing the purest death aura, first encountered the problem of bodily changes. The instincts of a zombie rapidly improved under the effect of pure death energy, and the feeling of bloodlust rose to a new level, as if it were about to consume Nian Bing's consciousness entirely.\n\nNian Bing told Dark Heavenly Fragrance that he had escaped the lake by relying on his mental power to simulate the form of death energy. While this was true, it was not the whole truth. Although he had comprehended mental power to a certain extent from Dark Heavenly Fragrance's abilities, his comprehension was not deep. How could he have done it so perfectly in a hurry? The simulation of mental power only restored some of Nian Bing's ability to act and made his body more comfortable. What truly saved him was the curse of Eternal Hell—the Demon Devouring Blade.\n\nYes, it was the Demon Devouring Blade. When Nian Bing fell into the water, he was holding the Demon Devouring Blade. As his body endured torment, the Demon Devouring Blade, like a fish in water, madly absorbed the death energy from the Lake of Death. Nian Bing was not the purest undead, but the Demon Devouring Blade was the purest dark magical artifact. Its pure darkness was of the same origin as the energy in the Lake of Death. Before Nian Bing could react, the Shadow Puppet had already appeared on its own, taking the Demon Devouring Blade from Nian Bing's hand. With just a flash, it repelled the death lake water around Nian Bing and, according to Nian Bing's mental control, flung him out of the lake, entering the waterfall ahead of Dark Heavenly Fragrance. Although everything happened extremely quickly, Nian Bing clearly felt the excitement transmitted to him by the Shadow Puppet during this process. This was the first time the Shadow Puppet had genuinely conveyed its feelings to him. At that very moment, Nian Bing finally confirmed that the Shadow Puppet possessed high intelligence.\n\nThrough mental perception, the Shadow Puppet told Nian Bing to stall for time, allowing it to absorb more death energy, and then to sneak attack from the rear, creating an opportunity for Nian Bing. Thus, after entering the waterfall, Nian Bing first threatened Dark Heavenly Fragrance with the fruit. Although everything he said afterward was reasonable, he did not have the slightest certainty in his heart. He didn't even believe his own words, but he made Dark Heavenly Fragrance full of doubt. Just as Nian Bing's senses detected the killing intent Dark Heavenly Fragrance had towards him, he knew he could wait no longer. Therefore, he seized the brief opening to attack Dark Heavenly Fragrance while simultaneously issuing a summons to the Shadow Puppet.\n\nIn a short period, the Shadow Puppet had absorbed a large amount of death energy. However, it belonged to darkness, and although death energy was a great supplement to it, it could not handle so much at once. Thus, upon receiving Nian Bing's summons, it immediately mixed all the death energy and dark energy it had absorbed, rotated them according to a certain method, and with the power of the Demon Devouring Blade, sneak attacked Dark Heavenly Fragrance from behind.\n\nOriginally, with Dark Heavenly Fragrance's strength, she should have been able to detect the Shadow Puppet. However, her mind was somewhat unsettled by Nian Bing's words, and her perception of her surroundings through mental power weakened slightly. Moreover, Nian Bing's attack also caused her considerable trouble. And the energy form of the attack launched by the Shadow Puppet was extremely similar to her own energy. Thus, she was unknowingly struck a blow by the Shadow Puppet, hitting a vital point.\n\nHeaven and Earth were constantly changing. The Shadow Puppet stared at Nian Bing and the woman he was holding, frozen. The Demon Devouring Blade in its hand was raised high, yet it could not be certain whether it should fall. At this moment, everything seen in the Shadow Puppet's eyes was truly bizarre.\n\nNian Bing closed his eyes, kissing the woman in his arms almost ecstatically. The woman in his arms kept changing, from the dignified Goddess of Life, Cao, to the infinitely seductive Dark Heavenly Fragrance.",

    "content": "Nian Bing watched Dark Tianxiang, her face full of confusion, continue, \"Would you like to hear our story? Seeing as you're the first person we've had intimate contact with, I'll tell you.\"\n\nAlthough Nian Bing was filled with doubt, his heart gradually relaxed. At least, he could no longer feel any hostility from Dark Tianxiang. He smiled faintly and said, \"Alright, I'd also like to hear about the secrets between your life and death. Oh, when I saw you earlier, you were clearly a bird, and I heard people say you're the leader of the four great magical beasts on the Divine Continent.\"\n\nDark Tianxiang chuckled, \"What four great magical beasts? I'm not a magical beast at all. You were right at the beginning; that was the appearance of a phoenix. It's just that, to distinguish myself from the phoenix, I could turn my head black. Magical beasts can transform into humans after cultivating to a certain level. Why can't humans transform into the appearance of magical beasts?\"\n\nNian Bing looked at her in surprise, \"Are you saying you can transform into a phoenix to confuse people?\"\n\nDark Tianxiang smiled slightly, \"Is there such a need? Who do I need to confuse? It's just that I like to transform into that appearance, and I was seen while transforming. Alright, let's not talk about this for now. You'll understand everything after you hear our story. As the God of Emotions, Kao and I are two separate existences, yet we exist together. Can you understand?\"\n\nNian Bing's heart stirred, \"The same body, shared souls, each possessing different abilities, right?\" Others might not have thought of it, but he had also experienced similar situations.\n\nDark Tianxiang nodded approvingly, \"That's right. Just as you said, we share souls within this body. Originally, my current appearance is our true form, but Kao insisted on taking on another appearance to distinguish herself from me, which is simply ugly. Kao and I are symbiotic from birth. If we talk about age, there are probably none older than us in this world. Tens of thousands of years have passed in the blink of an eye, and we have seen too much of everything in the world.\"\n\nNian Bing couldn't help but ask, \"Then who exactly are you? Why can you live for such a long time? Even the dragon race probably can't live for tens of thousands of years.\"\n\nDark Tianxiang said, \"That's right, even the dragon race generally doesn't live beyond twenty-five thousand years, while Kao and I have been living in this world for nearly fifty thousand years. We call ourselves the Seven-Day Gods of Emotion. Every seven days, we switch roles. Seven days ago, it was her, and today it's me. Converting between life and death, we became our current forms. Our souls each occupy half of this body. Neither of us can destroy the other, but neither of us yields to the other. Therefore, only by using this method can we maintain our symbiotic state. Although we are symbiotic, we can also feel everything happening outside when the other controls the body. Therefore, from the moment you stepped into the Realm of Life, I already knew you. Even everything that happened to you on the road was seen by Kao and me. Even we didn't expect that you would receive the help of those dwarves, and such sincere help. Along the way, you have passed Kao's test. We don't save people easily. Only after you pass both of our tests will we help you recover your vitality. Now you should understand why Kao asked you to find me here.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly, \"Then do I count as passing your test?\"\n\nDark Tianxiang's pretty face blushed slightly, \"What do you think? You were able to wound me in various forms. This hasn't happened in tens of thousands of years. After such a long time, feeling the pain of being injured again caused me to lose my composure, allowing that fellow Kao to seize the opportunity and take control of the body ahead of time.\" She couldn't help but laugh as she said this, \"Unfortunately, man's calculations are not as good as heaven's. She probably never expected that you would make such a move, that you would... As a result, she lost her composure even more than I did. After struggling for a while, she still lost control of the body to me. It's likely that within ten days, she won't be able to contend with me anymore. You're truly formidable; it's obvious you have a lot of experience in this area.\"\n\nNian Bing said with a wry smile, \"Experience, perhaps I do have some. I wasn't this ugly originally. Don't girls like novelty? Dark Tianxiang, I'm very curious about the origins of you Four Great True Gods. Since you and Kao have lived for fifty thousand years, the other True Gods should be similar, right? If so, what exactly are you? Can you tell me?\"\n\nDark Tianxiang naturally took Nian Bing's hand. In terms of appearance, she was even half a step superior to Fenghuang Nu and Bing Yun. Especially her seductive eyes and the perfect coordination of her body. Every simple movement brought immense temptation. As soon as Nian Bing's hand was held by her cool little hand, his entire body trembled. Fortunately, he was already a zombie; otherwise, his heart rate would have at least doubled.\n\nDark Tianxiang pulled Nian Bing to sit down and said, \"Don't worry about your sword. The Lake of Death only benefits pure undead like it. However, your sword spirit is very strange. I've seen super divine artifacts before, but this is the first time I've seen a sword spirit with such spiritual intelligence. Moreover, through my spiritual power detection, it seems to have memories. Be careful yourself. The God of Order and I, although we are all humans, have transcended human existence through technology. The world was destroyed in a technological war, and we also became one of the main culprits in the destruction of technology. When everything fell silent, and the world was almost entirely covered by the ocean, we all fell into a deep sleep for thirty thousand years.\"\n\n\"Thirty thousand years?\" Nian Bing stared blankly at Dark Tianxiang. Even with his intelligence, he couldn't fully comprehend everything she said. What was technology? What did it mean to be covered by the ocean?\n\nDark Tianxiang smiled slightly, \"Don't say you can't understand; even I don't understand it deeply. When we, who were called the ultimate weapons of war, appeared, the world was already on the brink of collapse. Everything we know was directly transmitted to our brains. It's just that we possessed too much wisdom and had great autonomy, which allowed us to survive when the world was being destroyed. Thirty thousand years later, when we awoke from our slumber, we found that the world had completely changed. The vast majority of the original continent had been swallowed by the ocean, leaving only a very small portion. These are the three continents you know: Yangguang Continent, the Lost Continent, and the Divine Continent. Among them, Yangguang Continent is the largest, followed by the Lost Continent, and the Divine Continent is much smaller. Why does the Divine Continent have its current environment and so many magical beasts? It's because of the various radiations left behind after the human destruction war fifty thousand years ago. After thirty thousand years of evolution, the creatures that survived managed to live on, but the environment of the Divine Continent could not be changed no matter what. The composition of the air underwent huge changes, and the subsequent era, known as the magical era, arrived. The Lost Continent was less affected than the Divine Continent. The radiation's impact only increased the number of magical beasts, and a few mutated races appeared, such as the dragon race, dwarf race, and elf race, all of which are creatures that evolved after radiation over many years. Yangguang Continent was the least affected. It almost preserved the original appearance of humans, and it is where humans began to develop anew from primitive society, eventually reaching this point. Yangguang Continent can be said to be the last pure land for humans. Kao and I, along with those three fellows, would fight almost every thousand years. However, we all knew that human society could not endure any more baptisms, so we chose to battle in the deep ocean. After another ten thousand years, the Lost Empire could no longer bear the enslavement by the people on the Divine Continent and launched a war, which is known as the God-Lost War. The war lasted for a long time and was very brutal, but it was a war among humans themselves, and we prehistoric people did not participate. However, at the final moment, a major event occurred on the Lost Continent, which was also the root of their eventual destruction. While these so-called gods on the Divine Continent are detestable, what the people of the Lost Continent did was too extreme, forcing the other three fellows to join forces and destroy the Lost Empire, otherwise, this world would truly cease to exist.\"\n\nNian Bing listened to this epic description, his mind working rapidly. Although he didn't fully understand, he was doing his best to absorb the story Dark Tianxiang was telling. At this moment, he already had a general outline in his mind. At the very least, he had a rough sense of what Dark Tianxiang was trying to convey. From her words, it seemed there was a special reason for the destruction of the Lost Empire.\n\nBefore Nian Bing could ask, Dark Tianxiang took the initiative to say, \"Originally, existences like us would not participate in the war between the Lost Empire and the Divine Continent. However, as the war was about to end, the Lost Empire discovered something that could destroy the entire Divine Continent. It was not human power, but something left over from prehistoric times – a neutron bomb with immense energy. You don't need to know what it is; just know its power is enough. The Lost Continent discovered some prehistoric civilizations and cultivated Lost Warriors using genetic principles. At the same time, they learned about the power of the neutron bomb from the prehistoric data they found. In their opinion, the explosion of the neutron bomb was enough to destroy the Divine Continent, and then there would be no more gods of the Divine Continent to threaten them. Although they didn't know how to use this bomb, they could detonate it with magic. Thus, they sent a group of people to secretly bring the neutron bomb to the Divine Continent. These people were all powerful individuals. They killed the guarding gods of the Divine Continent one after another, forcing them to retreat. Some high-level gods, who were the ones who guided our existence, thus, at the last moment, they begged us for help. Originally, we wouldn't have bothered with such trivial matters, but when we saw that neutron bomb, we had no choice but to intervene. The God of Destruction, the God of Time, and the God of Order immediately took action. When those Lost Empire warriors were destroyed, they seemed to sense our fear of the neutron bomb, so they threatened that there were similar things in the Lost Empire. Little did they know that this threatening talk had completely enraged those three fellows. You must know that this planet we are on was already very fragile due to the prehistoric wars. Only these three connected continents were suitable for human survival. If the neutron bomb detonated, even just one, it might cause the entire planet to collapse. At that time, human civilization would truly be annihilated, and no one would be able to survive. Therefore, those three fellows finally agreed to the gods' request and prepared to completely destroy the Lost Empire. At that time, Kao and I could see that the other side was merely putting up a brave front before death, and there might not necessarily be such things on the Lost Continent. However, the God of Destruction said that even if there was a slight possibility, it must be avoided. The risk of the planet being destroyed could not be forgiven for those humans. After Kao and I argued strenuously, they finally agreed to send away the Lost Continent, which contained the most prehistoric civilizations, instead of destroying it. Therefore, the ones who finally sent away the continent were not just the three of them; Kao and I also participated, although we were secretly providing them with power. With the combined strength of the five of us, a spatial transfer was completed.\" (End of chapter)",

    "content": "Nian Bing frowned deeply and said, \"Even if that neutron bomb was terrifying, how many lives did you sacrifice doing this? That was an entire continent! You also said that humans don't have many places to survive in this world. With a continent sent away like that, how many places are left for survival? Don't you ever think about these things?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance said, \"Don't say that to me. Don't forget, I represent evil death. I never think too much about these things. Moreover, the Lost Empire was only sent to a parallel space. There are still planets there, and perhaps life will be difficult, but it's not necessarily destruction. Otherwise, what would be the meaning of the sealing bottles of Mo Oudas they left behind?\"\n\nNian Bing's eyes flickered and he said, \"So, does that mean the Lost Continent can really return because of the sealing bottles of Mo Oudas?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance nodded and said, \"The Dragon God has reported the loss of the Mo Oudas sealing bottles to us. Actually, those seven bottles themselves are not important. The last words left by the Lost Continent said whoever could open the seals on the seven bottles to welcome them back would be their master. Actually, it's just a joke. Do you think a dignified empire would submit to one person? Furthermore, opening those seven bottles doesn't generate much energy.\n\nYou can imagine how powerful we five True Gods are combined. How much energy can just seven bottles generate? In fact, those seven bottles are just for positioning for the Lost Continent. The only thing that can truly bring them back is themselves. When the combined strength of all the powerhouses on the Lost Continent is sufficient, they may truly return to this world. Opening the seven Mo Oudas sealing bottles will provide them with guidance. If the Lost Continent really returns, its harm may not be that great. At most, it would be another battle with the Continent of Gods. The gods on the Continent of Gods will not allow them to do as they please.\"\n\nNian Bing thought for a moment and said, \"How much is sufficient strength? Do they need to have strength comparable to yours?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance shook her head and said, \"No. When we sent them away using space-time transfer, the energy was too immense, and we couldn't completely sever the connection between the Lost Continent and this world. Once they find the direction of guidance, it will be much easier for them to return. As long as there are a few people who can use Rank 13 magic and are willing to sacrifice themselves, it is very possible to send the Lost Continent back. This is because they can utilize the space-time orbits that we couldn't seal after the transmission, as well as the residual energy within the orbits. As for whether they can truly return, I'm not sure either.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded and said, \"Then I understand. If the Lost Continent really returns, will you still be enemies with them?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance said, \"Not necessarily. After sending the Lost Continent away, the energy consumption for us five was extremely large, and we slept for three thousand years before recovering our original strength. In these years, Kao and I have mastered a special ability that can detect all energy relics left from prehistoric times. As long as the Lost Continent doesn't have anything that frightens us, we won't bother with them. Although we True Gods, due to our great strength, are no longer controlled by our creators, in our subconscious, we always have the idea of destroying enemies. And the only ones who can be our enemies are the God of Destruction, the God of Time, and the God of Order. Therefore, the battles between us five are what we value.\n\nAll along, Kao and I, working together, have barely been able to fight those three to a standstill. However, they are more numerous than us. Their continuous progress in cultivation has gradually surpassed us. From the battles in the last few thousand years, we are gradually becoming unable to defeat them. If one day those three can completely destroy us, then everything about us will end. Perhaps, they will no longer stay on the Continent of Gods, but will explore new worlds. You are called Nian Bing, are you willing to help us? If you are willing to help Kao and me, perhaps we will have a chance to turn the tables.\"\n\n\"Me?\" Nian Bing looked at Dark Heavenly Fragrance in surprise, \"I am just an ordinary human. I haven't even reached the realm of a Divine Descendant that humans call it, so how can I help you? Do you want me to be cannon fodder?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance chuckled and said, \"Don't underestimate yourself. It's true, your abilities are not high enough, but your progress speed is astonishing. You haven't been on the Continent of Gods for long, but your mental power has reached a terrifying level. When you attacked me with all your might, you were actually able to cause vibrations in my mental power. Except for those few True Gods, I haven't encountered anything like this. Your mental power is very peculiar. If you continue to cultivate diligently, your future is limitless. No one can predict what level your strength will reach.\n\nKao and I, at our current level, find it very difficult to improve further. However, your Heavenly Eye acupoint has been fully opened, reaching the ultimate realm. With our help, you can quickly be trained into a master. Even if you can't contend with us, you can at least serve as a deterrent. Helping us has benefits, you know.\"\n\nLooking at Dark Heavenly Fragrance's tempting demeanor, Nian Bing couldn't help but feel moved. How he wished he could possess great strength! With the help of Dark Heavenly Fragrance and the Goddess of Life, when he returned to the Continent of Brilliance, the Goddess of Ice and Snow's High Priest would no longer be his opponent, and rescuing his parents would become very easy. Although he was moved, Nian Bing didn't show it on the surface. He calmly asked, \"If you and Kao defeat those three True Gods, what will you do? Enslave the entire world?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance pinched Nian Bing's hand and said with a light smile, \"You really have a wild imagination. With our abilities, if we could enslave this world, we would have done it long ago. However, what meaning would that have for us? We've lived for tens of thousands of years and seen too much. Although Kao and I often have disagreements due to our different personalities, we have a clear understanding of our future. If we complete our subconscious mission, then what we want to do is live a normal life. Like a normal woman marrying a husband and living a life like ordinary people.\n\nThese are what are most beneficial to us. So, will you help us? If you can help us defeat those three, then Kao and I will marry you and be your wives, alright? You can have great strength and take us as wives. These benefits are pretty good, aren't they? You should know that our physical bodies are made from the most excellent female genes. There are no more outstanding women than us in this world.\"\n\nNian Bing was stunned for a moment, then he shook his head resolutely and said, \"I don't accept this benefit. I already have a beloved woman, and my heart has no room for anyone else.\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance looked at Nian Bing in surprise, \"You can't be serious? Is the woman you like more beautiful than me? No, that's impossible.\" A trace of disappointment appeared in her eyes.\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"They might not be as beautiful as you, but we truly love each other. Perhaps, you and Kao should first experience love. Love isn't something that can be generated just by talking. Love needs to be cultivated, it needs the blending of hearts. For now, we can't even be considered friends. Although men may have relationships with women due to desire, and with you being so beautiful, it's impossible to say I don't desire you. But I don't love you. I love my women, so this benefit of yours doesn't have much attraction for me.\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance laughed, \"I thought you were that devoted, so you have several wives! Didn't you also say that love needs to be cultivated? I don't believe that if you spend more time with me, you won't fall in love with me. Alright, alright, stop talking nonsense. Are you willing to help us or not?\"\n\nNian Bing understood that while gaining great strength, he would also be putting himself in danger. Offending three True Gods was not comparable to dealing with the High Priest of the Goddess of Ice and Snow. He hesitated for a moment, but then nodded, \"Okay. I am willing to help you, because I need powerful strength. At the same time, I also really want to see what you and Kao look like when you are ordinary people.\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance's body trembled slightly, and her aura of death fluctuated unstably, but she quickly returned to normal and laughed, \"See? Kao has an opinion. You need to be careful. You kissed her, and she's very old-fashioned. Even if you help us, she might make things difficult for you. After all, to restore our vitality, we need to work together.\"\n\nRecalling Kao's indifferent expression and her disdainful look when she looked at him, Nian Bing couldn't help but smile, \"Even if she does something to me, I can only endure it. Who told me to snatch your first kiss?\" The merging of souls left a deep impression on Nian Bing. He would never forget that wonderful feeling.\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance stood up and walked to the plant. \"Do you know what this Heavenly Fragrance Fruit Tree is for?\"\n\nNian Bing followed her to the plant. It was only then that he had the chance to carefully observe the key item in the mission that Kao had given him. In this world filled with the aura of death, the plant was filled with vibrant life. The lush green branches were over three feet tall, and each leaf was so fresh and dewy that it held three fruits as clear as white jade, exuding a warm aura. Glancing at Dark Heavenly Fragrance, who was about the same height as him, Nian Bing said, \"Is this tree cultivated just to nurture an assistant who can help you deal with those three True Gods?\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance smiled and said, \"It seems our choice was correct. You are a smart person, and it's very easy to talk to you. That's right, this Heavenly Fragrance Fruit Tree, cultivated for tens of thousands of years and baptized by the alternation of life and death, is prepared for you. What do you think these three fruits will do?\"\n\nNian Bing thought about it and shook his head, \"I can't guess this, but I think these three fruits might not give me immense strength. More likely, they will transform my body.\"\n\nDark Heavenly Fragrance glanced at Nian Bing. Her enchanting appearance made Nian Bing's soul tremble for a moment, as she was truly too beautiful. \"You could say that, you guessed correctly. This fruit tree was not only cultivated in our respective domains, but we also used our powers to send it into the sky to absorb the qi of heaven and into the seabed to absorb the essence of earth before cultivating these three fruits. Eating them will not directly increase your strength, but it will allow you to possess the ability to exist with heaven and earth. In other words, after eating them, you yourself will transform into primordial qi, and the purest primordial qi at that. Perhaps, you don't yet have a deep understanding of primordial qi. True primordial qi can be transformed into any form of energy according to the user's will.\n\nAnd the one who manipulates it is your mental power. That's why, when we discovered you had sufficient mental power, we decided to let you become this person to help us. From now on, you will need to undergo a transformation process. Once you transform into a primordial spirit body with our help, you can leave here and return to your own world to cultivate diligently. When we need you, we will naturally contact you.\"\n\nNian Bing wanted to say something else, but Dark Heavenly Fragrance finally made her move. Her aura merged completely with her surroundings, as if the waterfall of death had become a part of her body. All the aura of death surged towards her like a mighty river. The surging deathly aura filled the entire cave. Heavenly Fragrance moved. She looked at Nian Bing with gentle eyes, as if a young girl looking at her lover. But the next moment, her slender jade hand was pressed against Nian Bing's chest. Nian Bing felt his body completely freeze, and then an indescribably vast aura of death surged into his body. Heavenly Fragrance's voice echoed in his mind, \"Hold onto your consciousness. No matter what, always maintain clarity of mind. Only then can your mental power fully merge with the primordial aura. I'm starting now.\" With a wave of her left hand, a Heavenly Fragrance Fruit detached from its branch, transforming into a condensed white light in the air and entering Nian Bing's mouth. The cool aura had no taste and spread to every part of Nian Bing's body in an instant. His body, which couldn't withstand the immense aura of death, became strong under the effect of this cool aura, constantly absorbing and expelling these terrifying energies. (. )",

    "content": "Dark Sky Fragrance reached out and tapped the dark green scales on Nian Bing's body. She smiled slightly and said, \"Quite sturdy, aren't they? But they'll disappear soon. You were so arrogant before, so now, even if I'm just settling a personal score, you'll have to bear with it.\" As soon as the last word left her lips, Dark Sky Fragrance moved. Her body turned into a shadow, spinning gently around Nian Bing. Her fingers moved nimbly, like ten living snakes, creating a soft melody as they fluttered continuously before Nian Bing. With every movement, her fingertips lightly touched him.\n\nThough the touches seemed slight, they gave Nian Bing a completely different sensation. It wasn't pain, but the crisp sound of scales shattering. Nian Bing's zombie body couldn't feel pain, but with each light tap from Sky Fragrance, a penetrating force seeped into his body, not only destroying the outer scales but also damaging his muscles, meridians, and bones. What does it feel like to hear your own bones shatter? Perhaps only those who have truly heard it would know. Even though it didn't hurt, it exerted immense pressure on his spirit.\n\nNian Bing's body gradually softened. As his bones and meridians shattered, the only thing supporting him was the surging aura of death. The cool airflow fully integrated into Nian Bing's body. He closed his eyes, enduring the discomfort of his heartbeat. Everything was enveloped by the aura of death. Sky Fragrance's body twisted strangely in the air and mysteriously merged into Nian Bing's. His spiritual power was violently shaken, and countless streams of energy surged towards Nian Bing's brain from all directions. With a flash of light, Nian Bing found that the scales on his body had completely vanished. He was now suspended naked above the center of the Death Lake. The Death God's Lake was like a mirror, its waters constantly churning, with the densest aura of death transforming into cone-shaped gray lights that continuously poured into Nian Bing's body.\n\nEverything was constantly changing. Sky Fragrance floated about thirty feet away from Nian Bing, watching him. She occasionally moved slightly, directing the death aura to gather towards Nian Bing. Time ticked by. Apart from the protective spiritual power in the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, Nian Bing's body had transformed from a zombie into a true death spirit. Even the Shadow Puppet, under Sky Fragrance's control, had merged with the Devouring Demon Blade into his body. Through the process of destruction and reconstruction, the intense impact of death energy had consumed over eighty percent of Nian Bing's spiritual power. However, accustomed to enduring pain, he persevered.\n\nA slight stinging sensation spread through his body. Nian Bing was surprised to find that the feeling he had been striving for for days had returned. Although he still lacked life force, he now felt like a human again. Gray meridians clearly appeared, and surges of power continuously flowed from the Zhong Li Acupoint in his chest into every part of his body. It was the familiar innate energy! However, this innate energy now seemed to have completely merged with the death aura, with no mutual repulsion, constantly circulating within Nian Bing's body. The external death aura had transformed into innate energy, continuously soaking him from the outside in. This innate energy was not under Nian Bing's control; instead, it was constantly integrating with his body. The Devouring Demon Blade floated out of Nian Bing's body, hovering before him with a black aura. Nian Bing clearly saw a dark energy sphere gradually condensing in his chest and abdomen. That familiar aura – wasn't it dark magic? A surge of joy washed over him. Not only did he regain sensation, but he also regained magic. How wonderful!\n\nUnfortunately, this was the Death God's Waterfall, and below it was the Death God's Lake. There were no magic elements of other schools, so the only magic he recovered was dark magic.\n\n\"Alright, you can relax now. The next phase is continuous remodeling. Get some sleep. When you wake up, everything will be even better,\" Sky Fragrance's gentle voice echoed in Nian Bing's mind. The chaotic innate energy within him suddenly softened, his spirit gradually relaxed, and drowsiness swept over his brain. Nian Bing felt his surroundings becoming illusory. His body had entered a moist world, and enveloped by sleep, he gradually lost consciousness. His last sensation was that the magician had sunk into the Death God's Lake.\n\nWatching Nian Bing gradually sink into the lake, Dark Sky Fragrance couldn't help but reveal a faint smile. She murmured to herself, \"This foolish boy, his will is so firm. It turns out that a kiss between people feels so wonderful. I really want him to kiss me like that again.\" Sky Fragrance's pretty face flushed slightly, adding a touch of vitality to her appearance. The intense stimulation from that kiss had affected not only Kaos, the God of Life, but also her. Moreover, the stimulation she received was no less than Kaos's. Otherwise, she wouldn't have revealed all her secret thoughts. Sky Fragrance, who had always longed for a normal life, yearned for it even more after her contact with Nian Bing. A large part of the reason she disallowed the gods from setting foot on the Radiant Continent was for their future. Although the God of Destruction, the God of Time, and the God of Order had different ideas, they were unwilling to offend this God of Emotion too deeply before a clear victor emerged. Therefore, the Radiant Continent had remained peaceful all these years. Sky Fragrance floated gracefully directly above where Nian Bing was sinking, slowly spreading her arms to her sides. The water level of the Death God's Lake continuously rose, while the Death God's Waterfall stopped flowing. The water of the Death God's Lake gradually formed a massive sphere of water. Sky Fragrance flashed and dove into the center of the water sphere, embracing the unconscious Nian Bing. A layer of black airflow completely enveloped them, allowing the immense death aura surrounding them to continuously assault them. The gray light underwent a gradual transition from gray to black.\n\nRadiant Continent, Cold Ridge.\n\nFour beams of light continuously shifted their positions in the air. Their movements were too fast for the naked eye to follow; only flashes and clashes of two red and two blue lights could be seen in the air.\n\nThe magical elements in the air fluctuated violently, and the aura of ice and fire permeated the uninhabited Cold Ridge. The four energies remained condensed in the air. Every attack or defense brought forth bursts of intense light. Although the condensed magical power did not destroy the surroundings, the distortion of the air indicated the immense scale of these energies.\n\nThe four beams of light, two red and two blue, were particularly striking as they weaved through the air. Judging by the intensity and volume of the light, one red beam was noticeably less refined and significantly weaker than the other three. Its control was also clearly less precise than the other three beams. Among the other three beams, one blue light was slightly weaker, but its control was extremely refined, often managing to avoid the sharp attacks of the other lights and launching attacks from tricky angles, achieving unexpected effects.\n\n\"I'm not playing anymore. It's not fair!\" The weakest red light retracted and revealed itself outside the combat circle, pouting with a dissatisfied expression. It was the charming and hot-tempered Xue Jing.\n\nSeeing her stop, the other three beams of light also dissipated, revealing their true forms. The two strongest beams were naturally the sisters Feng Nu and Lan Chen. The slightly weaker blue light was Long Ling.\n\nXue Jing looked at the three women and said aggrievedly, \"It's too unfair. You have the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, and controlling energy is as easy as picking something from your pocket. I don't. I finally pestered Galadriel¹ to help me advance to the Martial Saint realm, but I'm still so far behind you all. It's no fun. I want to open my Heavenly Eye Acupoint too.\"\n\nLong Ling, carried by a condensed blizzard at her feet, approached Xue Jing. \"Jing Jing, don't act like a child. Didn't Big Brother Galadriel say that the Heavenly Eye Acupoint is the most difficult among the human acupoints to open? You must proceed step by step and be careful not to go mad.\"\n\nXue Jing looked at Long Ling's concerned expression and couldn't help but chuckle. \"Alright, alright. Do you think I'm really angry? Although I'm much worse than you, this period has been my fastest period of progress. Sigh, I'm so jealous of you all! Nian Bing actually used his life force to help you open your acupoints. I really don't understand what he's thinking.\" As soon as she said this, she felt something was wrong. Her voice dropped significantly in the last sentence, but with the abilities of Long Ling, Feng Nu, and Lan Chen, how could they not hear her?\n\nLong Ling's face flickered with sadness. \"If Nian Bing could stay by our side, I wouldn't want this Heavenly Eye Acupoint. He's been gone for half a year, and there's been no news at all.\"\n\nXue Jing apologized, \"I'm sorry, Ling'er. It was my fault for speaking carelessly. Don't worry, how could Nian Bing bear to leave you? He'll definitely come back alive. He expended so much energy, and healing also takes time. You're just too anxious. I believe you'll see him soon.\"\n\nFeng Nu walked to Long Ling's side, put her arm around her shoulder like an elder sister, and smiled, \"Jing Jing is right, Nian Bing will definitely come back. Alright, let's continue cultivating. Ling'er, don't forget our goal.\"\n\nLong Ling raised her head, her eyes filled with determination, and nodded vigorously twice. \"I won't forget. I'll never forget. Okay, let's start again.\" She chanted a few soft incantations, and her blue light instantly intensified. A silver line of light lit up on her forehead, and under the effect of the blizzard, she flew into the air once more.\n\nHalf a year had passed. Under the guidance of the Dragon Kings, the women continuously cultivated. Long Ling, the most diligent magician, though outwardly frail, was extremely resolute. She knew very well that her strength was far inferior to Feng Nu and Lan Chen, so she worked even harder in her cultivation. In just half a year, with the nourishment of the Angel's Tears, the opening of the Heavenly Eye Acupoint, and her own relentless efforts, she had now reached the level of a Magus. She had even opened her innate domain, and her strength had increased significantly. Although she still couldn't compare to Feng Nu and Lan Chen, the gap had narrowed considerably.\n\nFeng Nu's progress was the most stable. She was already the strongest among the women. The opening of the Heavenly Eye Acupoint was like opening a great door of cultivation before her. For the past half year, she had leaped forward in her cultivation, reaching the early stage of the fifth transformation of the Nine Phoenix Transformations, a speed that even she found hard to believe. As for Lan Chen, although she didn't cultivate martial arts, under Feng Nu's guidance, she combined the secret techniques of the Phoenix clan with her Ice Phoenix physique, forging her own path and integrating it with ice magic, causing her Ice Goddess domain to undergo earth-shattering changes. The intensity of her ice magic had also greatly improved due to the modification of her Angel's Body. Among the three women, only she had had relations with Nian Bing. Nian Bing had obtained Lan Chen's virgin Ice Phoenix body and gained immense benefits in his magical cultivation. Unfortunately, he had directly used life curse magic and had no time to discover these benefits before turning into a zombie. But it was different for Lan Chen. She had obtained Nian Bing's virgin body, which also brought her immense benefits. Through her diligent cultivation during this period, her overall strength had become comparable to Feng Nu's. If the two of them teamed up, none of the Dragon Kings could defeat them without using their ultimate Dragon Language Magic.\n\nWatching the three women continue to cultivate diligently, Xue Jing muttered to herself, \"They've all gone crazy. Every day, it's nothing but meditation and combat, with no time for rest. It seems I should give them the title of 'crazy woman'! Hmph, that scoundrel Galadriel, he's not even trying to help me open an acupoint. I'm going to find him to settle this.\" She was unwilling to admit that she just missed that fire dragon since she hadn't seen him since breakfast.\n\nThe combat in the air continued until Long Ling had depleted all her magical power. Feng Nu and Lan Chen sat around Long Ling, absorbing the innate energy from the air while discussing the experiences gained from combat and their own insights. Cultivating together made it much easier for the three women to improve than cultivating alone.\n\n\"Sister, when do we make our move? I think our current abilities are almost sufficient. If we can secretly infiltrate the Ice God's Tower, we might be able to rescue Uncle and Aunt.\" After leaving the Ice God's Tower, Lan Chen had begun referring to Nian Bing's parents as \"Uncle and Aunt\" due to her connection with Nian Bing.\n\nFeng Nu shook her head. \"Chen Chen, we can't rush. Asking for help is necessary, but we need to cultivate our strength even more diligently. The Ice Goddess Priestess has been a Divine Descendant¹ for many years. I heard from Big Brother Galadriel that she has opened three more acupoints. Even if the three of us join forces, we won't be a match for her. Moreover, we need to safely bring Uncle and Aunt out of there, so we must have greater certainty. Let's wait another half year. We'll cultivate diligently for another half year, and our strength should reach another level. At that time, if Nian Bing still hasn't returned, we'll make our move.\"\n\nLong Ling lowered her head, her voice choked with emotion. \"Sister Feng, if... if Nian Bing really can't come back, then what do we do...?\"\n\n---\n¹ *Galadriel* is translated as *加拉曼迪斯* (Jiālāmàndísī), a phonetic transcription.\n² *Divine Descendant* is translated as *神降師* (Shénjiàngshī), literally \"God Descent Master.\"",

    "content": "Feng Nü smiled faintly and said, \"Ling'er, believe in Nian Bing. For us, for his parents whom he always misses, he will definitely return. Even if he doesn't come back, will our hearts change? If that day truly comes, we will help Nian Bing fulfill all his unfulfilled wishes, then take Uncle and Aunt to find a place to live in seclusion and wait for him, forever wait for him.\" There was no longer anyone among them who would try to persuade the others not to wait any longer, because they all understood that none of them could abandon this profound and unforgettable affection. Among the three women, Long Ling had the shallowest feelings for Nian Bing. She had barely spent any real time with Nian Bing, but at the very last moment when Nian Bing released his mental energy, he still remembered her. Using his final energy, he transmitted from a distance, and that drop of Angel's Tear had deeply confirmed Nian Bing's feelings for her, and that was enough.\n\nOn the summit of Green Mountain, a massive conical cavity was inverted, its shape resembling the caldera of a volcano. Everything around appeared incredibly silent. Unlike the green of the mountain, within this conical pit, reaching a depth of a hundred zhang, everything was gray, including the sky above the summit.\n\nFloating quietly above the conical pit was a figure. Ripples of death continuously emanated outwards from this figure. Those faint gray rays of light spread with balanced and gentle rhythm, making the energy fluctuations in the air appear so harmonious that it was almost a miracle on the Divine Continent. If anyone could currently examine the energy elements in the sky with their mental power, they would clearly see that after emitting the aura of death and becoming intangible, they would return within moments. Each dark element filled with death would absorb one of the water, fire, earth, wind, space, and light elements, and then merge with the imposing figure at the center. No dark element returned empty-handed. Centered around Green Mountain, due to the excessive loss of magical elements, even when the storm of magic raged further afield, this place remained calm, and all of this was because of the tall figure in the sky.\n\nThe release of death ripples finally ceased. An hour later, the seemingly eternal figure in the sky finally showed change. A pair of black eyes slowly opened. They were ordinary eyes, with nothing but tranquility in their gaze. There was not a trace of energy fluctuation. His black eyes gradually deepened.\n\n\"She actually gave all of this to me. It seems I have truly been reborn. Although it's not complete yet, this is a good start,\" Nian Bing said to himself with a faint smile on his face. Gazing at the densely packed dark clouds in the sky, a faint gray hue appeared on his newly fair skin. The gray flashed and disappeared, and everything returned to normal. He raised his hand and gently touched a light gray mark on his brow, his smile deepening. \"So, the true domain is here.\"\n\nHe raised his left hand, and a black light drifted out from his body, hovering quietly in front of him. A dark red pattern emanated from the narrow and long blade, and the originally black gem on the hilt had turned dark red, exuding a domineering aura of bloodthirsty intent.\n\n\"Come out. I think we need to have a good talk,\" Nian Bing said calmly to the Soul Devouring Blade, as if he were facing a person, not a blade.\n\nA bolt of black lightning drifted out from the hilt. The blade remained suspended, while in front of Nian Bing, another Nian Bing, entirely enveloped in black clothing, appeared. He looked at the naked Nian Bing and nodded, saying, \"You finally know.\"\n\n\"It's time I knew,\" Nian Bing smiled, his gaze very gentle.\n\n\"Yes! It's time you knew. However, I really didn't expect that the one I chose to inherit the Soul Devouring Blade would be so powerful. No, I should say, so quickly become this powerful. Only someone like you, who possesses true darkness, is worthy of using this Soul Devouring Blade, isn't that right?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled and said, \"There's one point you've mistaken. I am not the one who masters true darkness; I only grasp the secret of death. Death and darkness are not the same concept. Don't forget my identity. I am just a magician, no, I should say a magic chef. Can you tell me everything that happened back then? I really want to know about you, Lord Hei Wu Huang.\"\n\nYes, that shadowy puppet of Nian Bing was Hei Wu Huang. Nian Bing had fully understood this after entering the true domain of darkness.\n\nHei Wu Huang's expression was calm. \"Of course. Now, you are not only the owner of the Soul Devouring Blade, but you can also be considered my master. Among the seven of us back then, I was the only exception, because I was never a cultivator from the Bright Continent. This Divine Continent is where I once lived. It is precisely because I came from this continent that I knew the value of power and understood that strength is everything. The Bright Continent does not have weather as harsh as the Divine Continent, so to become stronger, I had to constantly challenge the strong. Only by doing so could I make myself stronger, and only by doing so could I one day return to this continent with my head held high.\"\n\nNian Bing looked at him with some surprise. \"Then, does that mean you should be one of the divine beings here?\"\n\nHei Wu Huang nodded. \"Yes. When I left here, I was already close to the demigod realm. It's just that later, I chose a different cultivation path, so I was driven out from here. Those so-called divine beings are just hypocritical fellows. They outwardly do not accept people who cultivate dark abilities, but what about them in private? Are their despicable methods any better than mine, who cultivates darkness? To save face, I exiled myself. After arriving on the Bright Continent, I met those six people, the six people you know. Among us seven, I was the strongest. Although the divine beings later feared I would reveal matters of the Divine Continent and unleashed divine punishment, could they really kill me? Even Safin could find a way to escape, let alone me? By then, I was no longer just a dark-attribute Divine Master. Even the Dark Dragon King had been defeated by me. My dark abilities had reached level thirteen. I had also opened three acupoints: one ultimate and two intermediate. Even facing the strongest power of the divine punishment, I did not die.\"\n\n\"Abandoning the physical body, using the soul as a blade, am I right?\" Nian Bing suddenly interjected.\n\nHei Wu Huang nodded. \"That's right, precisely so. The Soul Devouring Blade is a divine artifact. Because of my soul, it changed, becoming a super divine artifact. The moment you awakened my soul with your own blood, this Soul Devouring Blade underwent a fundamental transformation. And your innate energy, carrying the aura of darkness, also allowed me to regain a body. Although the body is in energy form, for me, it is enough. Safin chose to abandon his physical body for his life, while I abandoned my physical body to become stronger. Even if I can only have the blade as my main body and energy as the carrier of my soul, I will still be the strongest blade.\" His domineering words were filled with a desire for power, a choice bordering on madness. But Nian Bing, who had deeply experienced these things, understood Hei Wu Huang's spirit of seeking victory.\n\nLooking at Hei Wu Huang, who had the same appearance as him but a completely different demeanor, and then at the Soul Devouring Blade, whose dark red patterns flashed incessantly, Nian Bing said, \"Good, I understand. Your pursuit is the pinnacle of strength. Now, you are completely integrated with the Soul Devouring Blade, achieving this super divine artifact. From now on, we are friends, partners.\"\n\n\"Partners? Although I helped you, you must understand that I am also helping myself. Only by absorbing a large amount of dark energy and death energy can I separate my spiritual body from the blade body, not only reviving my soul but also gradually recovering my own strength. Moreover, I have been awake for a long time, but I did not tell you. Aren't you suspicious of anything?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled. \"Should I be suspicious? That was the past. In a sense, you and I have both been reborn. Let the past be the past. I will not retract my words. We are brothers. I just want to know how much of your strength has been recovered.\"\n\nHei Wu Huang smiled faintly. \"Well said, 'let the past be the past.' Yes! Perhaps I really should be reborn with you. My strength has recovered to my previous state after being cleansed by the death energy here. Although the Dark Dragon King has been constantly improving over the years, I am confident I can fight him to a draw. When you need me, I will be your help, and at the same time, I will unceremoniously use you as a basis to absorb dark and death energy. Your business here is completed. Before that woman left, she also helped me collect the other three dark magical beasts that were guarding Green Mountain into this Soul Devouring Blade. And she asked me to tell you to return to where you came from...\" With a flash of black light, Hei Wu Huang merged into the blade, and the Soul Devouring Blade flipped in the air, falling into Nian Bing's grasp.\n\nHolding the Soul Devouring Blade, Nian Bing stretched his body forcefully, a comfortable feeling spreading throughout him. He still had no life force, and his original darkness had even turned into complete death, but now he had a real feeling, a feeling like an ordinary person. His skin was no longer so stiff but full of elasticity. Apart from his slightly pale skin color, from the outside, he was indistinguishable from an ordinary person. More importantly, Nian Bing had now regained the most important thing he needed: magic.\n\nHis figure flashed, and he floated to the edge of the Green Mountain summit. He took a deep look at the spring of death, from which no more water of death was flowing. A gentle breeze blew, carrying Nian Bing's body as he descended, heading into the distance. Nian Bing knew very well how long he had stayed here – half a year! In half a year, on the surface, he had three gains. The first was regaining the feeling of being human. The second was regaining his magic. And the third was completely understanding the meaning of death. With just these three, his strength had not progressed as expected; everything remained at the original level. It was just that, unknowingly, Nian Bing felt that he had changed a little, a change originating from his body. Unfortunately, he could only feel the partial meaning of these changes. Perhaps, only by returning to where he came from would he understand all the changes.\n\nAs he flew forward, Nian Bing's heart began to pound, because he knew that upon returning to where he came from, he would face not the Dark Heavenly Fragrance, but the Goddess of Life, who had lost control of her body due to his passionate kiss. Would she let him go and easily help him recover his life? It was likely to be difficult.\n\nNever mind. Since Dark Heavenly Fragrance and Kao had chosen him, she couldn't possibly make things too difficult for him, could she? She couldn't possibly take action to see Xi Lu and the dwarf seniors, and also retrieve his six divine blades. Thinking of this, Nian Bing's flying body suddenly accelerated, speeding towards the direction he came from.\n\nHe had only flown for a short while when suddenly, the dark clouds in the sky changed. Amidst the friction of the clouds, the sky suddenly lit up. Nian Bing suddenly felt an unprecedentedly immense pressure from the sky. With rumbling thunder, his Heavenly Eye acupoint sensed the change in the sky, but how could human speed be faster than lightning?\n\n\"I can't be this unlucky.\" This was Nian Bing's only thought. Oh, no, it should be considered a loss.\n\nA body emitting black smoke and smelling of burning drifted towards the ground. The moment it collided with the ground, a ball of milky white light erupted from this body, slightly softening the impact on the grass.\n\nBOOM——.\n\nLying quietly on the ground, Nian Bing finally understood why almost no one he had seen since arriving on this Divine Continent was flying. It turned out that flying here probably had only one result: an intimate encounter with heavenly lightning. Perhaps only those at the level of Kao and Heavenly Fragrance would not be affected by lightning.\n\nWhat it felt like to be struck by lightning could only be understood by experiencing it. A numb sensation spread to every cell of his body, his entire body trembling slightly, and the meridians and blood within his body also experienced a momentary stagnation.\n\nNian Bing discovered that he was truly resilient. After being struck by lightning like this, he seemed to have not suffered greatly. The numbness gradually disappeared. Apart from being pitch black, and his unfortunate long hair turning to ash, there were no significant further troubles. He was unharmed.",

    "content": "No wonder Xi Lu said he was perverted; he really is! Could it be that Tian Xiang’s destruction of his Azure Eye Scale Armor back then didn't make it disappear, but rather integrate into his armor?\n\nHis meridians and blood were reborn in the aura of death. Being struck by lightning this time actually made Nian Bing feel much more comfortable. His blood even flowed more smoothly, and his magic power didn’t need him to control it at all. Ice elements transformed into water elements, cooperating with light elements to nourish his body. Meanwhile, other various magic elements completely retreated. These two magic elements worked to remove the scorched blackness on Nian Bing’s body and the effects of the lightning.\n\nBeing struck by lightning is this comfortable? Would he die if he were struck a few more times? The answer was unknown, so Nian Bing decided to go back to walking once his body recovered. He wouldn’t fly again until he found a way to counter heavenly lightning. He believed that on the Divine Continent, there must be a way to avoid heavenly lightning from the sky. Otherwise, why was the Dragon God fine when he flew back then?\n\nWhile Nian Bing was waiting for his body to recover, he suddenly sensed two streams of energy rapidly approaching him. This wasn't something he heard with his ears or saw with his eyes, but rather a feeling from his Heavenly Eye acupoint.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, a faint glint in his eyes. He carefully extended his spiritual sense first into the ground, then rapidly expanded it at a speed not much slower than lightning. He easily detected the two presences. They were human presences, and Nian Bing understood that he had encountered his first divine person since arriving on the Divine Continent.\n\n“Jie Shang, that guy who got struck should be around here. Let’s search carefully. Do you sense his aura?” a somewhat sharp voice sounded.\n\nAnother, deeper voice replied, “No, I can only sense his location based on the changes in the aerial magic elements. He should be close. We should find him if we search thoroughly. I hope that guy who got struck has some good stuff on him.”\n\n“It’s been a long time since we’ve seen such a fool. Over the years, we gods have all become smarter. We understand the continent’s environment more and more. We brothers don’t do anything we’re not sure of. It hasn’t been easy to find targets all these years. This time, it’s a big windfall for us. Even if that guy has nothing good on him, we can have a good meal. We haven’t eaten meat in a long time. The green lizards seem to have become scarce, most of them are occupied by those powerful gods. With our status as demigods, we can’t even eat our fill. If it weren’t for the order prohibiting us from leaving the Divine Continent, I would have gone to the Yang Guang Continent. Over there, with our strength, we wouldn’t be much different from being called gods. As far as I know, demigods like us are a bit stronger than Archmagi and Martial Saints over there, and there probably aren’t any higher-level experts on the Yang Guang Continent.”\n\n“Sigh, Na Du, do you think I want to save just myself and go? As long as someone is a divine person, they all think of going there. I just don’t know what those few main gods are thinking, actually restricting us. Besides, we can’t break through the barrier surrounding the continent. Otherwise, I would have slipped away long ago and wouldn’t be waiting until now.” Jie Shang’s deep voice held a hint of indignation.\n\nNa Du snorted, “It’s not like there’s no chance. I heard that the legendary Mu Odaas Seal Bottle was left on the Yang Guang Continent and guarded by the Seven Dragon Kings. Now, those seven god-level Dragon Kings have lost the bottle, and the situation seems very bad. Several main gods are discussing sending people there to find the bottle, and to recruit experts from the Yang Guang Continent to join our Divine Continent, so we can be ready to deal with the return of the Lost Continent at any time. No one knows the situation of the Lost Continent. If the Lost Continent has been developing over these tens of thousands of years, we might be in trouble.”\n\nJie Shang said, “Even if they send people to the Yang Guang Continent, they’ll probably send god-level experts. It definitely won’t be our turn!”\n\nNa Du chuckled, “If it’s not our turn, don’t you think we can sneak over there? If someone is going, the seal will inevitably be opened. At that time, we can try to find an opportunity. If we can slip out, once we reach the Yang Guang Continent, we can live a life a hundred times better than before. I heard that there are still many fools on the Yang Guang Continent diligently cultivating, wanting to come to our Divine Continent. Hahahaha, I wonder what they would think if they actually got here.”\n\n“Huh, look who’s fighting there. Let’s stop searching for now, let’s hide first.” Jie Shang’s voice was full of surprise. Immediately after, Nian Bing clearly felt the auras of Na Du and Jie Shang weaken considerably, and they hid in the crevice of a giant rock. While Jie Shang was surprised, Nian Bing had already sensed two other presences. Compared to Na Du and Jie Shang, these two presences were clearly much stronger.\n\nThe two balls of energy brought by the two individuals kept colliding violently. Although he could clearly feel the immense energy fluctuations, there was absolutely no sound. One of these presences gave Nian Bing a familiar feeling, a feeling that was difficult to describe, as if it came from a tacit understanding in his heart. Closing his eyes, Nian Bing summoned his spiritual power that had seeped into the ground and instantly expanded its coverage. Immediately, his spiritual power became like his eyes, clearly seeing everything happening in the direction of the energy fluctuations.\n\nThey were a white and a green ball of energy. The white light was steady, and the green light was elegant. The two balls of energy collided from the ground to the air. Since he was investigating with his spiritual power, Nian Bing could clearly feel the extreme density of the two energies as they attacked each other. Although the energies looked small in volume, their explosive power was immense. If he were to compare them to cultivators on the Yang Guang Continent, Nian Bing couldn’t find a single martial skill that could compare to them. Suddenly, he understood why he had that familiar feeling. The familiarity came from the white light, and he also recognized who the owner of the white light was.\n\nIn the not-too-bright energy light, the two figures, one in green and one in white, were very clear. The white figure looked to be in his forties, over two meters tall, with extremely broad shoulders. The dense aura of light made him appear sacred all over. While his appearance wasn’t handsome, his righteous demeanor was definitely not an act; it was a feeling from within, giving Nian Bing a sense of shock. His strength was clearly below that of the green light, but with every attack, he exuded a righteous aura, managing to fight the green light to a draw.\n\nNian Bing suddenly realized that at their level, moves seemed to no longer matter. Both sides were relying on speed, energy application, and energy intensity. Neither side was suppressed by the other in terms of momentum. The green-clothed youth, who was fighting the white-clothed middle-aged man, was about Nian Bing’s height. His short green hair looked very spirited, but the light in his eyes was very cold. His attack speed was clearly much faster than the white-clothed man. With every attack, the surrounding air seemed to tear, and his attacks made no sound because, centered on the point of attack, the surrounding space was torn into pieces, isolating even sound. He wielded his hands like swords, bringing out long trails of green light that constantly circled the white-clothed middle-aged man, both above and below. Every attack was a swift retreat, yet every attack felt very solid. This forced the white-clothed man to defend within a foot of his body. The milky white energy blade condensed from light elements in his hand was maneuvered in the narrow space, barely managing to block the green-clothed man’s offensive. Occasionally, when he launched a powerful attack that forced the green-clothed man back, he could catch his breath. Judging by their intensity, it was difficult to distinguish their strength. Although the green light was much stronger than the white light, it was not easy to break through the defense of the white light battle qi. The battle moved from afar to near, slowly moving towards Nian Bing’s direction, and their fight had entered a stalemate.\n\n“Good! Your sacred aura is indeed distinctive, but I don’t believe you can withstand my Wind God’s Thorn. Be careful, here it comes!” The green-clothed man’s voice was exceptionally impassioned, filled with cold killing intent. His body suddenly flickered in the air, and the light in his hands condensed into the form of two long swords. The green light immediately became fierce. With a shake of his hands, hundreds of green lights drifted out, suddenly heading towards the white-clothed man. As the green light traveled through the air, everything around it was distorted, making it impossible to discern their attack trajectories.\n\nThe white-clothed man, being able to contend with the green-clothed man continuously, clearly had his own abilities. With a wave of his sacred light blade, a milky white light screen appeared in front of him. Then, three more light screens appeared in succession. Before those green lights could strike, the four milky white light screens rapidly intertwined, forming a shield of light.\n\nThe sounds of “chih chih chih chih” constantly echoed, each sound splitting the air. Various magic elements in the air became violently agitated, especially the wind elements, which became exceptionally wild. Under the influence of the wind elements, the rushing green lights were surrounded by rings of green vortices, and their piercing intensity was greatly enhanced.\n\n“Good!” The white-clothed man’s milky white long saber suddenly disappeared. He pushed his hands forward without hesitation, propping up the four flickering light walls. At this moment, his eyes suddenly turned golden, and a sacred golden hexagram image appeared behind him. The aura of light elements clearly intensified.\n\nAll sound vanished as the green and white lights clashed, and even the two fighters stopped. However, in the next moment, their bodies flashed. The white-clothed man’s light shield turned into light spots and disappeared, while the Wind God’s Thorns emitted by the green-clothed man also vanished within the light shield. Green and white light rose in the air, and the white-clothed man and the green-clothed man stood back to back, as if everything was over.\n\nThrough his spiritual sense, Nian Bing clearly felt that the white-clothed man had gained the upper hand in this exchange. Although the white-clothed man was not weak, the green-clothed man’s piercing attack method was too overbearing. It was precisely because of this that the white-clothed man’s light shield did not fully block it; a few green lights still attacked his front. However, it happened so quickly at that moment that Jie Shang and his companion, who were hiding nearby, didn’t notice it at all.\n\n“You lost. Hand over that thing,” the green-clothed man said coldly.\n\n“Lost? The word ‘lost’ isn’t in my dictionary. In my mind, there is only life and death. If you want that thing, unless you kill me, you won’t get anything from me,” the white-clothed man’s voice was very steady, and also very firm, as if nothing could affect his resolve.\n\nThe green-clothed man slowly turned around, looking coldly at the white-clothed man, a sinister look in his eyes and a stronger killing intent. “Don’t think that just because a few main gods are nice to you, you can be arrogant in front of me. I can still kill you without anyone knowing. Hand over the thing, and I’ll spare your life.”\n\nThe white-clothed man also turned around. His expression was very calm, as if he hadn’t been harmed at all. “Then go ahead and do it. You know my temper. What’s the point of saying all this nonsense?”",

    "content": "With a slight smile, a faint divine light flickered in Nian Bing’s eyes. Looking at Zhamulun’s increasingly uncertain gaze, he also moved. He pushed off the ground with his right foot, retreating backward, and simultaneously transmitted his voice to Xi Lu, \"Big Brother, this fellow is very strong, and this place is too close to Dutian City. We shouldn’t waste too much time. Let’s join forces and take him down.\" Nian Bing had never had any knightly spirit. With Zhamulun’s strength, if Xi Lu alone tried to kill him, Xi Lu would have to pay a considerable price. With Nian Bing by his side, killing this fellow would obviously be much easier.\n\nXi Lu naturally understood Nian Bing's intention. A slight hesitation, a shake of his shoulders, and his body suddenly changed. A yellow light shot out, heading straight for Nian Bing, while he fearlessly met the nine waves of battle qi Zhamulun continuously unleashed.\n\nSeeing Xi Lu’s body become shattered amidst the nine waves of battle qi, Zhamulun couldn’t help but feel overjoyed. Although he was puzzled why this once powerful warrior would suddenly become so vulnerable, being able to deal with this formidable enemy made it much easier to face Nian Bing.\n\nJust as Zhamulun was preparing to continue his attack, a black light suddenly streaked across the sky. Vast battle qi condensed into a sharp blade, heading straight for his head. Zhamulun dared not delay. The green light on his hands flashed, and two long sabers simultaneously appeared in his hands. He crossed them in front of him, meeting the attack, and roared, \"Open.\"\n\nBoom—— The energy released from the collision of two thirteenth-tier experts was terrifying. Xi Lu, who had reappeared and resumed his dwarf form, tumbled three times in the air before landing far away. Centered on Zhamulun’s body, the ground within a fifty-zhang radius sank by a zhang. Under the surge of battle qi, even the dust was pulverized and scattered.\n\nZhamulun spat out a small mouthful of blood. Besides anger, a great sense of fear also increased in his heart. Because Xi Lu had used the fake body created by Nian Bing to distract Zhamulun, and then attacked from above with the God Slaying Axe, Zhamulun had already suffered a small loss. For experts of the same level, victory or defeat often hung by a thread.\n\nThe two green-flashing long sabers in Zhamulun's hands were obviously not ordinary items. The two identical sabers were four feet long, narrow, and possessed extremely dense wind elements. Unfortunately, a nick had already appeared on both sabers, clearly from the God Slaying Axe. These two sabers had always been Zhamulun's treasures, and now that they were damaged by Xi Lu, his heart ached.\n\nXi Lu landed more than fifty zhang away, coldly looking at Zhamulun. The black battle qi around his body continuously fluctuated like hellish black flames. The short hair on his head stood on end. Although his stature was short, his muscles were exceptionally bulging. The black metal of the Dwarf God Armor had no luster, but it completely merged with his entire aura.\n\n“Dwarf?” Zhamulun’s voice became much more serious. “You dwarves actually dare to run out of the Divine Continent? Hmph, we will surely annihilate your entire clan. This time, even Lord Ka’ao cannot help you.”\n\nUpon hearing the words “annihilate the clan,” Xi Lu’s heart instantly became enraged. He let out a fierce roar, leaped high, grasped the Dwarf God Axe with both hands, and swung it down at Zhamulun as if splitting the heavens and earth.\n\nA strange smile appeared on Zhamulun’s face. As a god-level divine person, having lived to this day, he had experienced too much. Angering an upright dwarf was not difficult for him. His body flickered in place, instantly becoming ethereal and formless like a wisp of green smoke. Xi Lu’s body had already been locked onto, but at this moment, the lock suddenly failed. His full-powered attack shot towards the ground, and the wisp of green smoke instantly escaped his attack range. Zhamulun’s somewhat excited voice sounded from behind Xi Lu, “Radiant Wind Cross Slash.”\n\nOnce warriors reach the twelfth tier, although overall energy becomes the key to victory, skill is what best reflects the gap between experts of the same level. Therefore, during battles, few warriors would go all out, always leaving themselves some room for retreat. However, the upright Xi Lu was now completely enraged by Zhamulun. His full-power attack made it impossible for him to change his forward momentum. At this moment, although he realized he had been tricked, the battle axe he had swung could not be recalled. He could only forcefully gather all his battle qi towards his back, preparing to endure Zhamulun’s attack head-on.\n\nIf it were only Xi Lu and Zhamulun facing off here, then in this exchange of attacks, Xi Lu would inevitably suffer a significant loss. Zhamulun’s strength was not weaker than his, and even with the protection of the Dwarf God, Xi Lu could not completely filter out the opponent’s attack power. Unfortunately, Xi Lu was not fighting alone. Although he was not calm, not far away, there was Nian Bing, who was calmer than anyone.\n\nA silver streak of light appeared gracefully behind Xi Lu almost at the same time the green cross slash was unleashed. Xi Lu’s forward-charging body instantly disappeared. Zhamulun, who was feeling triumphant, was greatly shocked. He naturally would not charge with full force like Xi Lu. With almost no hesitation, he turned, forcefully redirecting the unleashed cross slash towards his back.\n\nBoom———\n\nGreen and black battle qi filled the air. This time, the destructive power on the ground was even more severe. Within a hundred-zhang radius, not a single blade of grass remained. Xi Lu and Zhamulun both spat out a mouthful of blood. Zhamulun’s upper body was half-buried in the soil, while Xi Lu staggered more than ten steps after landing, nearly falling to his knees.\n\nIt turned out that when Xi Lu was in danger, Nian Bing had forcibly inserted a spatial puppet into his body, instantly teleporting him and his attack to Zhamulun’s back. Although the teleportation had caused some mental shock to Nian Bing, his peculiar acupoint, which merged the Sky Eye and Emperor’s Pole, although unable to perform physical mental power attacks, had become exceptionally solid. He only felt a momentary dizziness before recovering.\n\nXi Lu was instantly teleported, while Zhamulun had to change the direction of his attack at the last moment. Both of their attacks were weakened in effect, and neither gained an advantage. After landing, both were desperately condensing their battle qi. Xi Lu’s eyes had turned red with rage; all he thought about was attacking head-on. As for Zhamulun, he was now thinking of escaping immediately.\n\nIf Nian Bing’s killing intent was not firm at the beginning, then now Zhamulun had seen Xi Lu’s true divine form and insulted the dwarf race, whom he deeply respected. At this moment, Nian Bing’s killing intent had surged to its peak. Seven divine blades simultaneously appeared around his body, and seven shadow puppets surrounded his body in the center.\n\nNian Bing did not directly launch a magic attack at Zhamulun. He knew very well that with his absolute attack power, it would be difficult to harm Zhamulun, who had already reached the thirteenth tier. Unless he could restore his physical mental power attacks, it would be difficult to harm the opponent with magic, even if he exerted all his strength to use the twelfth-tier Divine Descent Technique, and the fanfare of the Divine Descent Technique was too great. In this location not far from Dutian City, it absolutely could not be used. Furthermore, he was not afraid of Zhamulun attacking him. With Xi Lu by his side, unless it was a super expert of the main god level, it would be impossible to attack him before defeating Xi Lu. Therefore, he made a special choice.\n\n“Eternal, sealed in chaos; balance, shattered in the void; dwelling in the deepest abyss of the universe, great deity, summoned forth, please respond to my plea. Overlap fantasy and reality, interweave weakness and strength. Change each other’s appearance, and bestow pain and sorrow upon them. — Intertwined Fantasy.” As the low incantation was chanted, the Sky Eye acupoint on Nian Bing’s forehead suddenly lost its seven-colored brilliance and turned into a hazy luminescence. A faint gray light drifted out. At this moment, it seemed to cover heaven and earth.\n\nEverything around turned gray, a gray devoid of any aura. The sky turned gray, the ground turned gray, and everything between heaven and earth twisted in this grayness.\n\nZhamulun suddenly found that everything in front of him was no longer real. A figure appeared in his mind, Nian Bing’s figure. Having survived for thousands of years, he was bewildered and didn’t know what had happened. Was it magic? No, he had never seen such magic, nor had he ever felt this way. He only felt clearly that everything within his body seemed to have changed. He suddenly found that his body was becoming slower and slower. Looking down, he discovered with terror that he had actually turned into a rock. The dwarf Xi Lu in front of him was growing exponentially, becoming a giant ten zhang tall in almost an instant. He felt fear. He exerted all his strength to urge the battle qi within his body and soared up, turning and running in the opposite direction. However, he was surprised to find that his body, which had blindly transformed into stone, no longer obeyed him and remained in place.\n\nThe earth trembled violently with the foot Xi Lu stepped forward. The gray world became more hazy. The massive battle axe seemed to split the heavens and earth as it chopped down. Gray lines twisted in the air, as if it was uncertain where they would land.\n\n“No.” Zhamulun roared, but he could not hear his own voice. He was trembling with fear. Never before had he felt death so close.\n\nNian Bing’s calm voice resounded in the depths of his soul, “You are a rock, you can do nothing.”\n\nZhamulun was still attempting his final resistance. He intended to block the battle axe cleaving towards his head with his double sabers, but he could still only feel that he was a rock. The next moment, his body became lighter and was thrown far away.\n\nXi Lu felt completely different from Zhamulun. As soon as he recovered, he attacked his opponent. Everything around him remained unchanged. Although the sky was a bit overcast, everything was so real. When he leaped into the air and condensed all his strength to launch an attack at Zhamulun, he was surprised to find his opponent standing there dumbfounded and running towards him. Although Xi Lu didn’t know why, he still swung his long-awaited axe.\n\nZhamulun raised his two gleaming green sabers, but his resistance was so weak. With a massive roar, the double sabers, lacking most of their battle qi support, were split into four pieces by Xi Lu. Zhamulun, under the immense impact force, also had his defense broken, his protective battle qi shattered, and was blasted far away. If not for his extremely strong inherent battle qi, this axe would have split his body in two. But even so, he had suffered severe injuries. His skin was covered in wounds under Xi Lu’s formidable battle qi, and he coughed up blood incessantly, appearing to be completely incapable of fighting.\n\nThe gray space vanished. The seven divine blades simultaneously entered Nian Bing’s body. Nian Bing looked tired but his eyes were filled with excitement. Among the three present, only he knew what had just happened. Intertwined Fantasy, this could be called a magic, or it could not. Because it was not emitted by any magical elements, but originated from Nian Bing’s mental power. When Nian Bing awoke in the Lake of Life on the Divine Continent, Ka’ao, to make him stronger and capable of self-preservation, based on his situation, developed several abilities that only Nian Bing could use and taught them to him.\n\nThe energy foundation used by Intertwined Fantasy itself was actually the energy of nothingness possessed by the young magic dragon Oscar. It could only be used by fully mastering the seven magical elements, based on the seven magical elements. Just in that instant, Nian Bing drew out all seven types of magical power within several hundred zhang, used his mental power as the basis, and unleashed this special magic, which even he needed an incantation for, through a special chanting method. Nian Bing did not know the tier of this magic, but Ka’ao had told him that this magic would increase in power with the strengthening of his mental power. The so-called Intertwined Fantasy was to use mental power to attack the opponent’s mental power, causing various complex illusions to appear in the opponent’s mind, weakening their control over their own abilities. When Nian Bing learned this magic, Ka’ao had told him that it had three major weaknesses. First, it was not a direct attack of mental power, but merely a disturbance. Thus, it could not cause true harm to the opponent, only causing the opponent’s mind to become chaotic for a period of time. The benefit of doing this was that the user did not have to risk backlash. Even if it failed, his own mental power would not have significant problems. The second weakness was that if the opponent’s mental power exceeded the user’s, or if their will was extremely firm, this magic, upon failure, would inevitably invite a fierce attack from the opponent, and the user, due to the consumption of mental power, would inevitably be at a disadvantage.",

    "content": "Except for Prince Rong, who remained standing in place, the seven elders of the Blood Lion Sect respectfully said, \"Greetings, Sect Master.\" Although their status did not require them to bow, etiquette could not be abandoned.\n\nNian Bing quickly and respectfully said to these seniors, \"Greetings, elders. Grandpa, why have you also come?\"\n\nPrince Rong's expression was grave, his face like still water. He glanced at the Xialu beside him and said in a deep voice, \"I heard you became an envoy for the Ice Moon Empire. Is that true?\" As soon as he received the news of Nian Bing's arrival from Rong Bing, and learned that Nian Bing had summoned the seven elders for a meeting, he immediately rushed over.\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"That's right, I am representing the Ice Moon Empire this time. This Brother Xialu is my friend, one of us, there's nothing inconvenient about it.\" As he spoke, Nian Bing walked to the head seat and sat down.\n\nPrince Rong's gaze had been following Nian Bing. Seeing him sit down, he said coldly, \"You need to give me an explanation for this.\"\n\nNian Bing calmly joked, \"Grandpa, since you handed the Blood Lion Sect over to me, you should trust my decisions. I am very clear about the Blood Lion Sect's tenets, and I am capable of handling things. You've come at a good time, saving me the trouble of looking for you. There are some things I wanted to discuss with you.\"\n\nPrince Rong's expression softened slightly, \"Nian Bing, I decided to pass the position of Sect Master to you because I valued your broad perspective and your abilities. I believe the Blood Lion Sect will develop better under your control. However, your arrival representing the Ice Moon Empire, accompanied by the Ice Goddess's priestess, makes me have to suspect your intentions. You should understand how important the Four Nations Consensus Conference is to our Hua Rong Empire. Also, you've been missing for over a year. Don't forget, you are the master of a sect. With such irresponsibility, how can I be at ease?\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"Don't worry, Grandpa, I will give you an explanation now. First, I want to ask you a question. While the Four Nations Consensus Conference is important to the Hua Rong Empire, is it equally important to our Rong family?\"\n\nPrince Rong was stunned. The expressions of the seven elders beside him shifted, seeming to grasp the main point Nian Bing was trying to make. Prince Rong frowned, \"Of course, it is important to my Rong family. The Hua Rong Empire is our foundation. If the Hua Rong Empire is prosperous, the Rong family will naturally prosper along with it.\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"If it were that simple, there wouldn't be a Blood Lion Sect. Grandpa, I just want to tell you... the Blood Lion Sect exists for the Rong family, but not for the Hua Rong Empire. If it weren't for my absence from the sect, just the matter with the Qiru Empire alone, I would never have let our sect's strength support your actions.\"\n\nPrince Rong looked at Nian Bing's clear azure eyes, and his heart understood some of what he wanted to say. He said in a deep voice, \"Continue.\"\n\nNian Bing said, \"Although our Blood Lion Sect is the largest underground force on the Yangguang Continent, we have always been mysterious, and few people even know of our existence. However, in the battle with the Qiru Empire, our sect suffered considerable losses, didn't it? Anyone with a discerning eye could see that the Hua Rong Empire used power that did not belong to them. Hua Tian the Great is your brother, but have you considered that he is now the emperor and must be very familiar with the situation in the army? I'm afraid part of our sect's secret has already been exposed. Moreover, in this campaign against the Qiru Empire, our sect's losses are probably not small. Is this what you hoped to see? Letting the lives of our sect brothers be sacrificed for the Hua Rong Empire? You have always been a subject. Perhaps you are not afraid of the phrase 'merit overshadowing the ruler,' but since you have entrusted me with the task of protecting the Rong family, I cannot help but think more deeply. Therefore, I have decided that from now on, without my command, the Blood Lion Sect will no longer contribute any effort to the Hua Rong Empire.\"\n\nUpon hearing Nian Bing's words, the seven elders all nodded slightly, and the First Elder even showed approval. When Prince Rong decided for the Blood Lion Sect to help the Hua Rong Empire attack the Qiru Empire, he had raised an objection. However, because Nian Bing was absent, and the other elders supported Prince Rong, the action was eventually carried out. Although Nian Bing did not participate in that campaign, his analysis now was exceptionally accurate, and every judgment was as if he had witnessed it personally.\n\nPrince Rong said coldly, \"My greatest wish in this life is for mages to unify the continent. As long as I live, I will strive towards this direction.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, stood up, and said, \"Grandpa, please calm down for a moment. Yes, I can understand your ultimate wish as a commander, but as I said before, all your efforts are for the Hua Rong Empire, not for our Rong family. Secondly, unifying the continent does not necessarily require conquest. With your methods, the final beneficiary will only be the Hua Rong Empire. However, if it is unified by my methods, the beneficiary will be our Rong family. I believe you are very clear about the 'change of sky' operation during the Ice Moon Empire's succession. Although I am not the monarch of the Ice Moon Empire, I dare say that with just one order from me, the Ice Moon Empire will truly change, becoming the best base for our Rong family. Is this something your years of warfare can achieve? I have only one ultimate goal: to use the power of our Blood Lion Sect to control every country on the continent, to become the true king of the continent. I think such an outcome is far more effective than your continuous warfare.\"\n\n\"I agree with the Sect Master's statement.\" The First Elder stepped forward and stood behind Nian Bing. Prince Rong was his son, how could he not understand his son's thoughts?\n\nPrince Rong watched his father actively step behind his grandson, a hint of loss appearing in his eyes. The other elders also came to stand behind Nian Bing one after another, proving their support with their actions. Although Nian Bing had disappeared for over a year, the 'change of sky' operation, which was almost impossible to complete in the Ice Moon Empire, was completed under his control, bringing immense benefits to the Blood Lion Sect. It was precisely that operation that established Nian Bing's extremely high prestige within the sect, truly gaining the affirmation of the Blood Lion Sect's seven elders. Nian Bing had proven with his actions that his ideas were feasible.\n\nLooking at the seven elders, and then at Nian Bing, Prince Rong said somewhat bitterly, \"Perhaps I am truly old now.\"\n\nThe First Elder, Zhao, said indignantly, \"You scoundrel, dare to act old in front of me? You're not old, you're muddled.\"\n\nPrince Rong then remembered that the elders present were all his seniors, and he felt a little embarrassed. \"Father, I didn't mean it like that. Since you all have decided to support Nian Bing, I have nothing more to say. In fact, I also understand that what Nian Bing said makes a lot of sense, but I still prefer to unify the entire continent with my own strength, with iron and blood.\"\n\nNian Bing stood up, walked to Prince Rong's side, and helped him sit down. \"Grandpa, you don't need to be discouraged. My decision takes the entire situation into account. As the strongest commander on the continent, I understand your aspirations. However, our Yangguang Continent cannot afford to have any more wars at this time, because foreign enemies could appear at any moment. Against these powerful enemies, only by completely uniting, uniting without borders, can we possibly resist them. Although I don't know when this possibility will occur, or if it might never occur, we must guard against it!\"\n\nLooking at the surprised gazes of Prince Rong and the seven elders, Nian Bing continued, \"You must all want to know where I've been for the past year or so. Even the Blood Lion Sect's intelligence network couldn't find me. This is because I was not on the Yangguang Continent at all. Ordinary people do not know of that place's existence, but I think you must know it, which is the so-called Continent of Gods where the gods gather. It was precisely because I went there that I disappeared for over a year.\"\n\n\"What? You went to the Continent of Gods?\" Prince Rong exclaimed in surprise. To the people of the Yangguang Continent, the Continent of Gods was a very mysterious existence, where the legendary gods resided.\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"That's right, I went to the Continent of Gods. I stayed there for a full year and a half. During this year and a half, I finally understood what those so-called gods are. The so-called gods are just humans. They also have long histories. Moreover, these gods are not as sacred as you imagine. In fact, they are all selfish people. Undeniably, these divine beings possess great strength, and there are also seal restrictions that prevent them from easily coming to our continent. However, I can be sure that once they appear, they will bring disaster to the Yangguang Continent. The enemies I mentioned that might appear are them. Although the number of divine beings is not large, the weakest among them has a strength close to that of a Martial Saint. The Continent of Gods is also not as beautiful as the legends say. Compared to there, the Yangguang Continent is practically paradise. If a group of powerful divine beings comes from hell to paradise, what will they do?\" Then, Nian Bing simply recounted his experiences on the Continent of Gods, but he concealed the details about the Seal Bottle of Mooordas and the Four True Gods, and did not mention why he went there. \"Precisely because of such a threat existing, it is imperative for us to develop rapidly in peace, to contend with the Continent of Gods by relying on numerical advantage. Even if they do not come, we must be prepared. Otherwise, the Yangguang Continent will undergo great changes, great disasters.\"\n\nLooking at the disbelieving expressions of Prince Rong and the seven elders, Nian Bing nodded to Xialu. Yellow light surged, and the disguise of the Everlasting Blade was instantly removed, revealing Xialu's true appearance.\n\n\"The legendary dwarf race, I don't know if Grandpa and the seven elders have heard of them. But I can tell you that my Brother Xialu's strength has surpassed that of a Divine Master, reaching a strength close to the thirteenth level, which is the strength of a divine-level expert on the Continent of Gods. I think this is enough to prove my words.\"\n\nSilence fell upon everyone in the conference room. Nian Bing returned to his seat. He was not in a hurry. He knew that what he had said was difficult for Prince Rong and the others to comprehend, and they needed time to process it. He also believed that with Grandpa Prince Rong's wisdom, he would not fail to understand his meaning.\n\nAfter a long silence, the First Elder was the first to speak, \"Nian Bing, what do you want to do now? I want to hear your thoughts.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, \"What I want to do is very simple: maintain the current situation on the continent. The Hua Rong Empire and the other three empires will have a north-south confrontation and develop simultaneously. The Four Nations Peace Talk is naturally something that must be completed. At the same time, the Orlan, Ice Moon, and Langmu empires will form an alliance. This way, the Hua Rong Empire will have no reason to send troops against the three countries. Only in this way can peace be restored to the continent.\" He relayed the conversation he had with Luo Rou and Mu Jing at the congee shop earlier and clarified his views. Nian Bing knew that although the Four Nations Consensus Conference had not yet begun, as long as his grandfather agreed with his idea, the overall situation would be settled, and the meeting to be held the day after tomorrow would not have any variables. The Hua Rong Empire's objective would be achieved, and Nian Bing's objective would also be achieved.\n\nPrince Rong said, \"The affairs of the Hua Rong Empire are not something I can decide alone, Nian Bing. Although I approve of your plan, do you have the confidence to persuade my old friends? This conference is presided over by Su Yue, and persuading him is not an easy task. In terms of wisdom, I have never seen anyone more brilliant than him.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"I deal with intelligent people. I think Grandpa Su will also understand the current situation. Moreover, the Hua Rong Empire also needs peace at this time. As for the future, as long as the other three empires develop, it will not be easy for the Hua Rong Empire to launch an attack again. Before coming here, I thought very clearly. For a period of time to come, the Blood Lion Sect must infiltrate the Langmu Empire and the Orlan Empire. When these two empires become like the Ice Moon Empire, our Rong family will prosper forever.\"\n\nPrince Rong nodded, \"Alright, I agree with your approach. In fact, the Blood Lion Sect will only obey your command. As long as the three countries agree to the peace talks, then this conference will be much easier.\"\n\nNian Bing stood up, \"Grandpa, then I will take my leave. The future of the Rong family still depends on you. After the peace talks end the day after tomorrow, I will leave here immediately. If there is any news, I will inform you through the Blood Lion Sect. Strengthen training, enhance our own controllable strength, and respond to all changes with constancy is the best strategy. Seven elders, I am leaving now.\"\n\nAmidst the respectful farewells of the seven elders, Nian Bing left the secret stronghold of the Blood Lion Sect with Xialu. Although the conversation was brief, it had achieved the desired effect, which was enough. (. )",

    "content": "Mu Jing sighed, \"At a time when the country's survival is in doubt, how can we, as superiors, not worry? Nian Bing, just say whatever you have to say.\"\n\nNian Bing asked, \"Princess, are you blaming me for not agreeing to join forces with the Langmu Empire to attack the Huarong Empire?\"\n\nMu Jing glanced at Nian Bing and said, \"This is your decision on behalf of the Ice Moon Empire, but I hope you will consider it carefully. It's not about blaming you or not; I just hope you can look at the bigger picture. Of course, if you didn't come here truly for the benefit of the Ice Moon Empire, then anything more I say would be useless.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"If I didn't come for the benefit of the Ice Moon Empire, then why would the King of the Ice Moon Empire trust me so much? Perhaps I cannot become friends with you, but I think we can certainly become partners who utilize each other. You wouldn't doubt this, would you, Mu Jing?\"\n\nMu Jing sneered, \"You are quite frank. Partners who utilize each other? Would true partners utilize each other? Stop beating around the bush. It's getting late, and you and I are alone in a room. Aren't you afraid your confidantes will be jealous?\"\n\nNian Bing replied, \"They are my confidantes, so they naturally trust me. Mu Jing, why is your Langmu Empire so eager to unite with the Orlan and Ice Moon Empires to wage war against the Huarong Empire? I assume it's definitely not because of that sneak attack by the Huarong Empire back then.\"\n\nMu Jing said, \"Of course not. The Langmu Empire is vast and rich in resources, and we could afford that loss. However, as you know, the Huarong Empire destroyed the Qilu Empire. What does that represent? Vicious ambition; they will absolutely not stop there. Once they recover, the next target will be us or the Orlan Empire. In this situation, if we divide, we both lose, but if we unite, we both benefit. Only by attacking the Huarong Empire at its weakest moment can we possibly achieve victory. Otherwise, once the Huarong Empire consolidates the forces of the Qilu Empire, who will be their match? The continent will inevitably become solely the Huarong Empire's territory. It's not that we want to fight, but we have no choice but to fight.\"\n\n\"Good. If the Princess thinks so, then we have common ground. The Princess worries about the future expansion of the Huarong Empire. Then, I would like to ask, if our three empires unite and launch a war against the Huarong Empire, what are the chances of victory? After conquering the Qilu Empire, the Huarong Empire, due to its strategic planning, only paid the minimum price. Although they now need a certain number of troops to control the surrendered soldiers, their main forces have not suffered significant losses. If you want to defeat the Huarong Empire, you should at least have a way to deal with the Flame Demon Dragon and Flame Lion, those two super knight orders. Do you have one? You don't. Although I am not familiar with the situation in the Langmu Empire, I am not sure your forces can contend with the Huarong Empire's knight order that uses earth dragons as mounts. If a real fight breaks out, the most likely outcome is mutual destruction, and the three-empire alliance will gain nothing, only losing troops and suffering casualties. Moreover, although the three empires are allied, can you say that there is absolute trust among them? Even if mutual destruction occurs, due to the lack of unified command, the recovery speed of the three empires will definitely not match that of the Huarong Empire, and in the end, the fate will still be defeat.\"\n\nMu Jing snorted, \"How do you know I don't have a way to deal with the Flame Demon Dragon Knight Order? Indeed, the main forces of the Huarong Empire are still there, but with the combined strength of our three empires, plus the divine descent technique of your Ice Snow Goddess Priest, we have some chance. Does the Huarong Empire have any experts who can counter the divine descent technique?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled, and his peculiar gaze made Mu Jing feel a little uneasy. \"Princess, you are not telling the truth. I don't believe you cannot discern that Prince Rong already has the strength of a divine descent master. I think your confidence mainly comes from your two helpers from the Divine Continent.\"\n\nMu Jing was greatly shocked and looked at Nian Bing in horror. Although her will was firm, hearing Nian Bing suddenly reveal her true reliance, she could not hide her inner panic.\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly, \"Princess, you don't need to overthink. As soon as I met Zhamu Lun, I recognized his origin. But have you ever thought that if your Langmu Empire can find such helpers, can't the Huarong Empire also find them? True war is about national strength. The armies of the Huarong Empire have been in frequent battles in recent years, far surpassing the other three empires. Therefore, what I said about mutual destruction is just the best outcome; a more likely scenario is a pyrrhic victory for the Huarong Empire. By then, your Langmu Empire will truly have no chance. I believe this is definitely not what the Princess wants to see. Judging from the current strength of the three empires, your country and my Ice Moon Empire both have the strength to fight, but the Orlan Empire has been weak for a long time. Although there have been some changes in the past two years, only national strength has increased, not military strength. Even if we all agree to send troops with you, the final outcome will not be as I predicted. Princess, you are a smart person, and I don't think I need to say more.\"\n\nMu Jing looked deeply at Nian Bing, \"What if we don't fight? Will the Huarong Empire let us go? Once they recover their strength, although your Ice Moon Empire is far away, after our Langmu Empire is destroyed, you probably won't be able to escape the same fate. I'd like to hear what you think. You seem quite confident.\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly, \"That's right, after the Huarong Empire annexed the Qilu Empire, its national strength has indeed greatly increased. However, it's not necessarily true that our three empires don't have advantages. In terms of overall area, our three empires are still slightly larger than the Huarong Empire, especially your country, which is the granary of the entire Yangguang Continent. The three empires exchange resources. If our Ice Moon Empire and your Langmu Empire help the Orlan Empire develop, when our three empires are all very strong and form a solid alliance, even if the Huarong Empire becomes stronger, it will not dare to lightly offend. The situation of North-South confrontation is irreversible. What is needed now is not war, but development. The premise of development is peace. Therefore, I, on behalf of the Ice Moon Empire, are willing to form an alliance with your country, but this peace talk must be successful.\"\n\nMu Jing took a deep breath, \"Are you really that confident? Nian Bing, why should I believe you? You are clearly from the Rong family. How do I know this isn't you trying to scare me?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled calmly, \"I said that I left the Rong family when I was very young. If even you can see this, how could the current King of the Ice Moon Empire not know? Since he trusts me and allows me to attend this peace talk as an envoy of the Ice Moon Empire, why can't you believe me? Would you rather believe Zhamu Lun, who plotted to take your virginity?\"\n\n\"You—\" Mu Jing suddenly stood up, looking at Nian Bing with surprise and uncertainty. This handsome young man felt so terrifying to her, as if he could see through any secret she had in her heart. Mu Jing's heart pounded violently, and a blush appeared on her beautiful face. She said hatefully, \"Did Zhamu Lun tell you? Have you known him for a long time?\"\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"Do you want to ask me when Zhamu Lun betrayed you? Actually, you shouldn't ask that, because you've misunderstood. I am indeed meeting Zhamu Lun for the first time today, and I did learn all this from him. Unfortunately, he is not my friend. I disdain to associate with selfish and despicable divine beings, no matter how strong they are. Your teacher Zhamu Lun, whom you relied on, has long lost his most precious life. Oh, no, it should be a despicable and selfish life. Perhaps his soul has gone to hell.\"\n\n\"What did you say? You killed him? No, that's impossible. I absolutely don't believe it.\" Mu Jing said to Nian Bing decisively. She knew very well what Zhamu Lun's strength was. If it weren't for his strength, which reached the level of a divine master, why would she agree to exchange her body for his support? She had witnessed Nian Bing's magic before. Although Nian Bing was considered a strong practitioner among the younger generation, in her opinion, Nian Bing could not compare to Zhamu Lun from the Divine Continent.\n\nNian Bing sighed, \"Princess, you are too stubborn. Would you rather believe Zhamu Lun, who promised to support you in exchange for your virginity, than believe me? Yes, Zhamu Lun is indeed very strong, but I was still able to kill him. The so-called gods from the Divine Continent are merely self-righteous humans. Since they are still human, why can't they be killed?\"\n\nMu Jing's delicate body trembled, and she sat back in her seat. The color drained from her face, and she murmured with a trembling voice, \"No, this is not true. Zhamu Lun is dead. How could he die?\" The reason she dared to openly woo the Orlan Empire upon arriving in the Langmu Empire yesterday without worrying about possible surveillance by the Huarong Empire was because of Zhamu Lun's presence. She had great confidence in Zhamu Lun's strength. Although she deeply disliked that divine being in her heart, she had to admit that Zhamu Lun possessed formidable strength. In her opinion, even the Ice Snow Goddess Priest might not be Zhamu Lun's match. Even if she encountered any danger in the Huarong Empire, with Zhamu Lun's protection, she could safely return to her country. However, Nian Bing told her that Zhamu Lun had been killed by him. In Mu Jing's heart, there was a sense of relief. After all, how could she truly be willing to give her body to someone she disliked? But Zhamu Lun's death also plunged her into a crisis. Without the support of that powerful being, she no longer knew what to do. Facing Nian Bing or the Huarong Empire, she found that she no longer had the right to speak. Although she was not familiar with Nian Bing, and even resented this guy who repeatedly disrupted her plans, she knew that Nian Bing was not someone who would fabricate lies casually. Moreover, if this were a fabrication, it would be too ridiculous and easily exposed. Mu Jing's mind was completely in disarray at this moment. She didn't know how to face all this. Zhamu Lun was dead, but his companion was still in the Langmu Empire. If she returned with the news of Zhamu Lun's death, the Langmu Empire's palace would likely face the possibility of assassination by a divine master at any time. That was a situation she absolutely did not want to see.\n\nSeeing Mu Jing's surprised and uncertain expression, Nian Bing smiled and said, \"Princess, are you worried? Actually, you don't need to be. I hope you can calm down and think carefully about what I said. Everything I've done is just to prevent war. I have no enmity with the Langmu Empire, so why would I harm you? As long as you are willing, after our three empires form an alliance, the Ice Moon Empire will join your Langmu Empire in supporting the development of the Orlan Empire. Then, when our three empires are united and jointly resist the Huarong Empire. If you are worried about the other divine being staying in your Langmu Empire, I can also help you resolve it. Perhaps only when you truly witness my strength will you believe all this.\" A colorful light appeared between Nian Bing's eyebrows, and in the center of this colorful halo, a point of golden starlight rose. The pressure created by the fusion of the Huangji Acupoint and the Tianyan Acupoint reappeared. Mu Jing was not an Ice Snow Goddess Priest, and Nian Bing did not need to use too much mental power to make her discover in horror that she had already lost the ability to resist. Nian Bing in front of her became even more mysterious and powerful in her heart. The feeling of being unable to even speak gradually smoothed Mu Jing's chaotic thoughts.\n\nThe light receded, and everything in the room returned to normal. Mu Jing gasped for air, \"Are you really willing to help me get rid of that person? What is your purpose? What do you want to gain?\"\n\nNian Bing said calmly, \"What I say, I will do. I have no purpose in helping you, nor do I need your Langmu Empire to do anything for me. I have no good feelings towards divine beings.\"\n\nMu Jing looked at Nian Bing with suspicion, \"That's not right. In my opinion, you have your own purpose in everything you do. As a member of the Rong family, if you work so hard for the Ice Moon Empire, can the Rong family tolerate you? Be honest, what do you want to get from our Langmu Empire? If you are willing, you are very welcome to join our Langmu Empire. We can give you what the Ice Moon Empire gives you.\"\n\nNian Bing chuckled, \"Why don't you believe me when I speak the truth? Do you want me to ask for your virginity like Zhamu Lun did? I'm not that despicable, am I?\"\n\nMu Jing's pretty face turned bright red, \"You have three confidantes whose beauty surpasses mine, so you naturally wouldn't fancy me. Who knows if you're telling the truth.\"",

    "title": "Chapter 253 What is the peak of love? (superior)",
    "content": "\"Yes, we are all alive and well, because, at the last moment, we finally understood the true meaning of love, and also understood why our fusion as Emotion Gods failed,\" Tianxiang's tone held a hint of helplessness, but no dissatisfaction.\n\nNian Bing asked curiously, \"Why exactly?\"\n\nTianxiang sighed, \"Because we shouldn't have used you; that was our biggest mistake. Only at the pinnacle of love can the Emotion Gods fuse perfectly, and the peak state of love is devotion. This is the true meaning of love! And all we wanted was to take. Therefore, we were destined to fail. But the love between you, Feng Nü, and Lan Chen truly ascended to the realm of devotion. Frankly, although Kao and I were very surprised, we also felt a sense of relief. After we understood, we simultaneously made a decision: if we continued, it would mean total destruction, but if we changed our method, only the two of us would be destroyed. Do you know? As you ascended to the peak of love, Kao and I also finally reached the highest realm of love. We devoted not only our own love, but also all of our energy. At that time, we felt that even sacrificing our lives would be worthwhile. Thus, the true Emotion God was indeed born.\"\n\nNian Bing was dumbfounded, \"You, you're not going to tell me that I've now become...\"\n\nTianxiang chuckled, \"Your expression right now is so amusing! Yes, I can tell you definitively, Kao and I have both made wedding dresses for you. You have now absorbed all of our abilities and have completely fused through the sublimation of love energy. You have become the perfectly absolute Emotion God.\"\n\nNian Bing's mouth hung open, unable to close. He never imagined it would turn out this way. He had actually become the Emotion God? Was that even possible? But, judging by Tianxiang's words, it didn't seem like she was joking.\n\nKao said, \"Tianxiang is right. When we understood that the peak of love is devotion, we finally understood where the Father of Human Evolution made his mistake. His mistake was creating us all as women. If we had been one man and one woman, we might have comprehended the true meaning of the Emotion God tens of thousands of years ago. But as women, no matter what methods we used, we could never have successfully cultivated to that supreme realm. But you, you became our shared lover, and through our complete devotion in deep love, you absorbed all of our energy and transformed into a true god.\"\n\nNian Bing murmured, \"Then, then what is your current situation? After dedicating all your abilities to me, you must be...\"\n\nKao smiled, \"Don't worry, we won't die. True love is mutual devotion. Although we have lost our energy, we have created a god like you. With your abilities, you can give us new life at any time. Although we have lost our powers, at least we can still be ordinary women. You could say we are now a part of your body; your spiritual imprint now includes the presence of two more beings. Although we have lost our great powers, we have gained the reward of remaining by your side forever. You won't be able to abandon us even if you wanted to, even if you are the Emotion God.\"\n\nNian Bing forced a smile, \"Is this considered forced intimacy? Will Chen Chen and Feng Nü be alright?\"\n\nTianxiang said, \"We don't care if it's forced intimacy or not. In any case, when you accepted our abilities, you also accepted our love. This will never change. Don't worry, your two ladies are perfectly fine. They are just too weak from a night of consummation; they only need stable rest and it won't have any negative impact on their bodies. The sun is already up; I think it's time for you to face those divine beings.\"\n\nNian Bing said urgently, \"But, I seem to have lost all my abilities now. I have no acupoints, no magic power. How can I fight? Also, where did Oscar go?\"\n\nKao said, \"The dragon energy form within your body is indeed very strange. The instant you absorbed our two energies, it clearly sensed the massive energy fluctuation and immediately absorbed some of it, entering a dormant state. I believe when it awakens, it will regain its physical form and become the most powerful dragon. Following you, it has indeed gained considerable benefits. As for your lost magic power and the like, it's all unimportant now. You are already a god in the true sense; what need do you have for magic? What need for acupoints? Remember, the ability of the Emotion God is emotion itself, controlling all emotions, including the emotions of all living beings – be it humans, animals, or plants. You can even grasp the emotions of stones. At the same time, you can also master the emotions of every celestial phenomenon in this world. As long as you wish, you can destroy anything in an instant. That is why we say the Emotion God is perfect. Everything has emotions, even the tiniest magical element. You, as you are now, have become the ultimate existence for all cultivators. You can do whatever you want. As for how to use your abilities, that depends on your own experience.\"\n\nNian Bing lowered his head and looked at his hands. After hearing Kao's words, he suddenly felt a sense of exhilaration, as if everything in the world was within his grasp. Subtle emotional sensations flowed within his heart. Just as Kao said, everything in the world has emotions, even the air. Every minuscule thing could enter various states under the control of emotions. So-called emotionlessness was merely relative.\n\nTianxiang encouraged him, \"Go forth, our great Emotion God, and shine your brilliance upon this world.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded gently, \"Thank you for your devotion. I never imagined that one day I would become an existence I least believed in. The devotion of love, indeed, is powerful. How strong can level eighteen energy be? Perhaps, I can truly destroy those divine beings now.\"\n\nKao said, \"What you will face is not just divine beings. The tens of thousands of years of grievances between us and those three fellows from Order will also be settled by you. There are no more uncertainties. I can already sense their aura; they have discovered our deceptive puppets and are heading towards the Lost Continent, searching for our existence. However, due to our current location, it will still take them some time to find us.\"\n\nNian Bing carefully covered Feng Nü and Lan Chen with quilts. He sensed that both of his wives had only one emotion in their hearts: sweetness. He gently caressed their delicate faces, \"Sleep, sleep well. When you wake up, everything will be over.\" Kissing them lightly on their foreheads, Nian Bing finally stepped out of the tent.\n\nIn just one night, his changes were so immense. Putting on a simple white robe, Nian Bing reappeared in the open. The air greeted him cheerfully. Looking out, everything was so full of life. Various emotions allowed Nian Bing to see another beautiful world – a wondrous world only he could see, a world composed of emotions. Different emotions had different faint glows, and each emotion was constantly changing. The emotions of the warriors appeared somewhat solemn and worried. They were all busy.\n\n\"Don't worry, everything will be alright,\" Nian Bing said subconsciously. Suddenly, he saw a faint purple light spread from within his body, instantly covering the entire camp of the Yang Guang Continent Allied Forces. Everyone's gaze turned towards Nian Bing's location, and their emotions immediately fluctuated slightly. Worry gradually disappeared, replaced by a joyful feeling, an exceptionally beautiful feeling. Seeing everyone's faces reveal faint smiles, Nian Bing was also startled by himself. He didn't feel any energy fluctuations emanating from him, but the facts were before him. Through these changes in their emotions, he suddenly realized in his mind that everyone had heard his not-so-loud voice.\n\n\"See? Just a subconscious thought from you can change the emotions of others. This is the power of a god. Every emotion is the best lethal weapon; when emotions reach their extreme, mutations occur.\"\n\nInsights flashed through Nian Bing's mind. Faced with reality, he finally understood the true mystery of the Emotion God.\n\nFamiliar figures gradually appeared before Nian Bing. On everyone's face, amidst excitement, there was surprise. They had all heard Nian Bing's voice and felt the changes in their emotions, but they didn't understand how Nian Bing's voice had suddenly appeared in the depths of their hearts.\n\nLooking at the familiar faces appearing one after another, Nian Bing smiled. He suddenly realized how wonderful the feeling of having everything under his control was.\n\nBing Ling and Rong Tian were the fastest to reach Nian Bing. They were both surprised to discover that the powerful aura their son had originally exuded had disappeared, replaced by a sense of peace. His smile appeared as warm as a spring breeze.\n\n\"Nian Bing, are you alright?\" Bing Ling asked with concern. Not being able to raise her son from a young age had always been her greatest regret. Now, her son's strength made her have to bear heavy responsibilities, and she could be enveloped by danger at any moment.\n\nNian Bing smiled and shook his head, \"Mom, don't worry, I'm fine.\"\n\nThe Dark Dragon King, Bo Ji'ao Xi Si, also walked over and stood beside Nian Bing, saying softly, \"Nian Bing, since you have a way to deal with that divine curse, then there's no need to fight the Xi Realm again, is there? If we launch a full-scale assault, we still have a chance of winning. That arm left to us by Xie Yue should be used now. Although it's an incredibly evil thing, even the most evil things can be used for good. Since the start of the great war, I've been hesitant to use it, but now it seems like the time has come.\"\n\nNian Bing sighed softly, \"Brother Kai Jie, give me Xie Yue's arm.\"\n\nKai Jie'ao Xi Si did not hesitate. In the hands of the strong, even evil things can be utilized to their fullest potential. With a flash of light from his hand, Xie Yue's arm, which he had sealed with dark magic, was presented before Nian Bing.\n\nSuddenly, Kai Jie'ao Xi Si was astonished to see that Xie Yue's arm floated up from his grasp as if it had lost all weight, hovering in the air. The grayish-black arm seemed even more sinister in the air. Nian Bing said, \"Such an evil thing should not exist. It represents endless death. Go, return to your original form.\" A faint purple aura drifted and enveloped the grayish-black arm, which began to change. Under the invasion of the purple light, the grayish-black arm trembled violently. Its skin gradually turned fair from its originally ferocious color. In just a few blinks of an eye, this arm, which Xie Yue had prepared to use against strong opponents, became indistinguishable from a normal human arm, only appearing somewhat pale due to the absence of blood. The purple light disappeared, and with a light gust of wind, the arm turned to dust and vanished, its original evil attack power instantly becoming null and void.\n\nNo one understood what kind of ability Nian Bing possessed, as they hadn't sensed any energy fluctuations, yet Nian Bing had truly achieved the perfect destruction of that evil existence. Everyone's gaze became even more bewildered.\n\nNian Bing smiled slightly, \"I know you are all very confused now about how I gained this ability. However, there's no time to explain now. The Xi Realm should be waiting for me. After I resolve the trouble of the divine beings, I will explain it to you all in detail, and then you will naturally understand everything. Rou'er, prepare the troops. Today, your mission is only to observe.\" Nian Bing's words were very calm, but they inadvertently exuded immense confidence. All the strong individuals of the Yang Guang Continent realized one thing: Nian Bing had achieved a new level of improvement during his cultivation.\n\nJoy spread. Nian Bing's body levitated without any warning, rising into the air. Without any elemental fluctuations, he floated like a light feather, slowly heading towards the battlefield. Having mastered the emotions of the air, flying was simply a matter of course for him.",

    "content": "Ten years later. **Ice Moon Empire**, Peach Blossom Forest.\n\nTwo small figures quietly squeezed through a gap in a fence made of branches. They were two children, a boy and a girl. They were about the same height, both **years old. Although the boy was not old, he was handsome, with a very energetic head of blue short hair, and a hint of simple honesty in his brows.\n\nThe girl was extremely beautiful, with long blue hair a shade darker than the boy's. Most striking were her strange, intelligent big eyes, looking left and right as if filled with wisdom.\n\n\"Lingji, let's be careful. Your dads and moms are too powerful. We absolutely must not be discovered by them, otherwise our adventure trip will be ruined,\" the girl whispered into the boy's ear.\n\nThe boy caught a faint scent, and his small face couldn't help but blush. \"Jiebing, do we really have to go? Dad and moms will worry.\"\n\nThe girl giggled and said, \"It's okay, didn't I leave them a note? Actually, what I'll miss the most is your dad's cooking. I wonder if there's anything as delicious outside.\"\n\nThe boy seemed a little helpless. \"Since we're leaving, let's go quickly. **(Full text first release)** Once you've had enough fun, we can come back early.\"\n\nThe girl chuckled, \"Lingji, if we get into trouble, will you protect me?\"\n\nThe boy puffed out his chest and said, \"Of course, I'm your fiancé! I, Rong Lingji, swear that no matter the circumstances, I will do my best to protect my fiancée, Zha Jiebing, even if it means sacrificing my life, I will not regret it.\"\n\nThe girl quickly covered the boy's mouth. \"Ptooey, ptooey, don't say such unlucky things. Let's go quickly. It feels so good to go out and play. Oh, right, did you steal the knife you told me you were going to steal from your dad? I heard that knives have magic, which should help with your magic.\"\n\nThe boy gave a wry smile. \"I don't know if Dad will spank my butt when we get back. Let's go quickly, if they discover us, we won't be able to leave.\"\n\nThe two figures slipped away quietly, heading south.\n\nThey had just left when two figures appeared out of thin air in the courtyard.\n\n\"Nianbing, how did you let your son take my daughter and elope?\" Zha Ji looked at his disciple with annoyance.\n\nNianbing gave a bitter smile. \"Master, don't blame me. It was clearly your daughter who took my son away. Lingji has been very well-behaved since he was young. He wouldn't have had the guts to do this himself.\"\n\nZha Ji glared. \"Then why didn't you let me stop them just now?\"\n\nNianbing smiled slightly. \"Why stop them? Let them go out and bump into things; it might not be without its benefits. When I was six years old, I was wandering around with my father. By the time I was ten, I had already started learning cooking from you. They will grow faster in society. These two little fellows! Master, I really didn't expect you to have such a mischievous daughter.\"\n\nZha Ji chuckled. \"It's good that your Lingji is as outstanding as I imagined, in every way, just like you were back then. Actually, on the surface, Lingji seems to listen to Jiebing about everything, but Lingji is wise enough to appear foolish. Although he and Jiebing are the same age, he has always treated Jiebing as a sister and indulged her. But aren't you worried about their safety?\"\n\nNianbing replied with annoyance, \"You are absolutely right, old man. Lingji has quite a few tricks up his sleeve. Worried about their safety? Don't joke. Do you know what he stole from me before he left? He took my Demon Devouring Blade, a top-quality gem for summoning the Exploding Milk Golden Ox from Cat-cat, a death-exemption gold token from the Olan Empire from Luo Rou, the Phoenix Tribe Chief's Token from Phoenix Girl, the Golden Thorn Token from the Lang Mu Empire from Mu Jing, and the Stone of Life condensed by Ka'ao after recovering his life energy. With your daughter's temper and the items my son took, it's more likely they'll be bullying others than being bullied.\"\n\n\"Damn it, your son is ruthless! He truly takes his dad's things without hesitation. Fine, I didn't misjudge this kid. I don't care anymore. I'm going back to sleep. Anyway, if my daughter gets into trouble outside, I'll hold you accountable.\"\n\nWatching his master's retreating back, Nianbing couldn't help but show a faint smile. Just then, a gray shadow drifted away. Nianbing glanced in the direction it left. \"Kaka is still worried. With him following, it's even more secure. Who can be a match for the future Dragon God and Black Warrior Emperor? Hmm, I should go too. Third Young Master called me to play Mahjong. It's not good to be late. I heard that the God of Light's Longbow is powerful this time, and Mad God Lei, Death God Ah-dai, that guy called Sea Dragon the Solitary Immortal, and the Interstellar God Tian Hen are all going. Third Young Master created the six of us; I wonder how this Mahjong game will be played? Will there be six-player Mahjong? Heh heh, I want to compete with them to see who is the strongest among the six protagonists created by Third Young Master. I am the God of Emotion!\"\n\n(Grand Finale) (. )",
