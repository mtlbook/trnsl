    "content": "Thank you all for your continued support for Xiao San. With this new book, Xiao San wants to write a novel where the protagonist uses pure magic. Of course, it's bizarre magic, a combination of magic and culinary arts. I hope you all like it. Please bookmark it, fellow readers. This book will begin updating when [Kong VIP]* fully concludes, tentatively on August 1st. This series will definitely bring something new and fresh. Please continue to support Xiao San. Starting August 1st, whether for public or future VIP chapters, there will be at least two updates daily.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMisty clouds drifted, swirling like smoke, bringing a touch of dampness to the mountaintop with a gentle breeze.\n\nAs the mist passed and clouds drifted, the bald mountaintop was revealed. In the center of the peak, a tall, corpulent man sat on the ground, chewing on something. \"Sigh, I've eaten my last chicken leg. Why isn't that guy here yet? He's deliberately teasing my appetite. It's truly not easy to get a grand meal from him. Heavens! Why isn't he a woman? If he were, I'd marry her even if it cost me my life, so she could comfort my stomach every day.\" As he spoke, the corpulent man rubbed his belly with his greasy large hands, his face full of lamentation. However, an expression of lamentation on his large, fleshy face appeared utterly comical.\n\n\"Fatty, you're daydreaming again. Do you think I still can't beat you this time? As long as I win, you must return Feng Nü to me.\" A low voice, as if from the Netherworld, resonated.\n\nSeven points of brilliant light drifted gracefully, landing simultaneously with a soft 'ding' in front of the corpulent man, arranged in the formation of the Big Dipper. These were seven blades, but only their hilts were visible. At the end of each hilt, a dazzling gemstone of a different shape and color was embedded. Blue, red, green, yellow, silver, white, and black intermingled and shone brightly, instantly covering the mountaintop with a shimmering, precious light.\n\nThis was no ordinary precious light, but a special barrier that integrated seven magic elements. Unless the caster willed it, or the seven colored gemstones activating the barrier were completely destroyed, no one could move these seven blades.\n\nThe corpulent man clapped his hands and laughed, \"Excellent, excellent! My treasures have arrived. Kid who uses these treasures, come out too. Hurry and let me see what new tricks you've got. If you can beat me, I'll return Feng Nü to you. Otherwise, as usual, give me a full seven-element feast.\"\n\n\"Hmph, Fatty, be careful. This time, I'm afraid you won't just miss out on a seven-element feast; you might lose your life here.\" From within the mist, a figure in a grey cloth robe slowly walked out. It was a young man who appeared to be in his twenties, with long golden hair flowing down his back. A faint chill covered his handsome face, handsome enough to make women jealous. His blue eyes, clear as lake water, calmly gazed forward. He didn't look at the corpulent man, his gaze fixed on the seven shining gemstones, as if they were his entire life.\n\nThe corpulent man chuckled. \"That depends on your skill. You should know, Fatty will fight with all his might for food. As the saying goes: Shredded meat is precious, sliced meat is more valuable; if there are large chunks of meat, both can be discarded.** Come on, come on. The fat in my belly should still be enough for a round with you.\"\n\nThe golden-haired young man sighed. \"Fatty, why must you make things so difficult for me? Return Feng Nü to me, and at most, I'll make you a full seven-element feast for a month straight. If you don't let me see Feng Nü, then today, even if I have to desperately use life magic, I will keep you here.\"\n\nThe corpulent man pinched his fleshy chin. \"No, that won't do. If your heart has no focus of longing, the taste of what you make will be inferior. After tasting the best, how can you expect me to eat something inferior? To be honest, your talent, young man, is the best I've ever seen. To attain such a level in magic truly makes me, Fatty, admire you greatly!\"\n\nThe young man smiled bitterly. \"You know I practice magic not to be a mage, but to create more delicious dishes. Besides, at most, I can only use Level Eight magic.\"\n\nThe corpulent man shook his head. \"It's different. Although you can only use Level Eight magic, your control and understanding of magic are incomparable to those so-called Archmages. I ask you, who among them can achieve Ice and Fire from the Same Source, and use that power to draw upon the essence of other magic elements to control the other five magic elements: wind, earth, space, light, and darkness? Although it's only auxiliary, you are the first all-element mage on the entire continent. I remember what they call you. Indeed, your power fundamentally lies in ice and fire; this title suits you best. Haha, today I'll have something good to eat again.\"\n\nA cold light flared in the golden-haired young man's eyes, and he frowned. \"So, that means we still have to fight.\"\n\nThe corpulent man laughed. \"Of course, of course. I'm still waiting to eat your seven-element feast. Just like before, I'll give you time to chant your spells. Go on. A little warm-up before a meal is certainly nice. I seem to have gained quite a bit of weight recently.\"\n\nThe golden-haired young man's gaze changed, becoming exceptionally focused. From beginning to end, his eyes remained on the seven exposed gemstones. \"We've known each other for quite some time, and I haven't introduced you to my implements yet. They are my closest friends.\"\n\nThe corpulent man said with some curiosity, \"Oh? I really haven't heard you talk about them. These seven blades are each stranger than the last. Do tell.\"\n\nA look of obsession appeared in the golden-haired young man's eyes. \"Sigh of the Ice and Snow Goddess—Morning Dew.\" With a soft hum, blue light suddenly flared, and the water elements on the mountaintop visibly intensified.\n\n\"Roar of the Fire God—Sunblade.\" Red light glowed.\n\n\"Whisper of the Free Wind—Sky-Proud Blade.\" Green light glowed.\n\n\"Melody of the Earth's Awakening—Everliving Blade.\" Yellow light glowed.\n\n\"Six-pointed Star of Divine Ingenuity—Xuanji Blade.\" Silver light glowed.\n\n\"Dawn that Pierces Heaven and Earth—Holy Radiance Blade.\" White light glowed.\n\n\"Curse of Eternal Hell—Demon Devouring Blade.\" Black light glowed.\n\nThe seven-colored lights suddenly flared, interweaving into brilliant colors like a rainbow. The golden-haired young man smiled, looking at the seven-colored lights, and said, \"They are the Seven Divine Blades, and also magic staves that condense the seven elements: ice, fire, wind, earth, space, light, and darkness. Most importantly, they are all my kitchen knives.\"\n\nThe smile on the corpulent man's face suddenly vanished, replaced by a solemn expression. He clearly felt that this time, the young man's aura was distinctly different from before. A faint golden light appeared on his body—it was none other than the pinnacle of battle qi—Divine Battle Qi. His upper body slightly leaned forward, his large, corpulent body enveloped in golden light, appearing at this moment like a solid greatsword. Yes, he was a Sword Saint, possessing the highest title for a martial artist.\n\nThe golden-haired young man's eyes shone brightly. He raised both hands, his slender, nimble fingers, driven by his forearms, swiftly drew two six-pointed stars in front of him—one red, one blue, appearing strikingly distinct. \"Oh, Goddess of Ice and Snow, grant me eternal ice! Oh, God of Fire, grant me the flames of the Phoenix's Nirvana! In my name, the extremes of ice and fire, fuse!\" The seven gemstones on the seven blades lit up simultaneously. Red and blue lights intertwined and surged, drawing the other five colors to rush towards the golden-haired young man.\n\nThe seven-colored lights enveloped the young man's body, using the previous red and blue six-pointed stars as a guide, forming a strange, full-element barrier. A strange smile appeared in the young man's eyes as he said to the corpulent man, \"Let me show you my newly researched special technique magic: Full-Element - Shadow Puppet.\"\n\n...\n\n---\n*  **Kong VIP**: This likely refers to a specific VIP program or the VIP access for the author's previous work, which may have been named \"Kong\" or \"Empty.\"\n**  **Shredded meat is precious, sliced meat is more valuable; if there are large chunks of meat, both can be discarded**: A parody of a famous Chinese poem about life, love, and freedom.",

    "title": "Chapter 1: The Chasing of Ice and Snow Sacrifices (Part 1)",
    "content": "The scorching sun was like fire. A tall and imposing man slowly walked forward with a child. The man wore a fiery red magic robe, and the golden flame embroidered on his chest symbolized his identity as a Magus. Long golden hair cascaded down his back, and his bronze-colored face was chiseled and angular, as if carved by knife and axe. However, a faint sorrow flowed in his brown eyes.\n\n\"Nian Bing, are you tired?\" The man looked down at the child he held by the hand.\n\nThe boy's height only reached the tall man's waist. His appearance was six parts similar to the tall man's, though his facial lines were much softer. He also had golden hair. Though still young, his handsome appearance was more striking than the tall man's. He had a pair of aqua-blue eyes. His body looked a bit frail. Due to exhaustion, his face was pale, with faint traces of sweat at his temples.\n\nHe shook his head firmly. \"Dad, I'm not tired. Are we going to see Mom soon? I... I really miss Mom.\"\n\nThe tall man looked up at the scorching sun in the sky. The dazzling sunlight seemed to have no effect on him whatsoever. \"Yes! We're going to see your mom. Ten years have passed, and you're already ten. For ten years, the world is vast, yet there's no place for us father and son. No matter what, this time I must see your mom, even if it costs my life.\"\n\nNian Bing, being still young after all, looked at his father somewhat puzzled. \"Dad, why don't they let us see Mom?\"\n\nThe tall man snorted coldly, his eyes seemingly spitting fire. \"They, humph, they. Nian Bing, you're still young. When you grow up, you'll understand. For your mom, Dad can give up everything. But I truly can't bear to part with you! You're still so small. When we reach the village ahead, how about you stay there and wait for Dad?\"\n\n\"No, Dad, I want to go with you to find Mom. Mom already doesn't want me anymore, are you going to abandon me too?\" Nian Bing's eyes reddened, and he gripped his father's large hand tightly, for fear that he would abandon him.\n\nThe tall man took a scroll from his怀and handed it to Nian Bing. \"Do you remember how Dad taught you to activate a magic scroll? You can come with me, but at a critical juncture, you must remember to use this scroll. It will transport you to a safe place. That's the place where Dad drew the magic array the day before yesterday.\"\n\nNian Bing took the magic scroll into his hand, nodded obediently, and said, \"Dad, I understand.\"\n\nThe tall man sighed and said, \"It's a pity time is too short. Your talent is even better than mine. If time allowed me to teach you more, perhaps you would become the top-tier fire elemental magician on the entire continent. However, time doesn't allow me to wait any longer. If we can't reach Ice God's Fortress tomorrow, we'll never see your mom again.\"\n\nNian Bing nodded, half-understanding, and said, \"Dad, from now on, I will definitely become a powerful fire elemental magician like you.\"\n\nA hint of wistfulness appeared in the tall man's eyes. \"I remember back then, when your mom and I were together, we discussed what magic our child should cultivate if we had one. She was an ice elemental magician, and I was fire. Ice and fire are incompatible, so our child could only choose one. At that time, your mom said that if we had a boy, he would learn fire elemental magic from me, and if a girl, she would learn ice elemental magic from her. Thinking about it now, she seems to be right before my eyes. Her words still rang in my ears, yet she was gone.\"\n\nAt this point, his voice suddenly became a few shades louder. \"I, Rong Tianshi, the Fire Elemental Magus, must stop the succession ceremony of the Priest of the Ice Goddess and reclaim my wife!\"\n\n...\n\nThree days later.\n\nIt was a mountain peak approximately a hundred meters high. The peak was steep; though not tall, it gave off a sharp, formidable feeling. The grayish-blue mountain body looked somewhat grim and forbidding. Although some vegetation grew on it, it was extremely sparse, perhaps due to the steep terrain. Unless one was accustomed to traversing mountain foothills year-round, ordinary people would find it very difficult to climb such a steep peak. At the foot of the mountain, a great river surged from south to north. This was a famous mother river on the Yangguang Continent, named: Azure River. The great river traversed nearly two-thirds of the Yangguang Continent, spanning nearly two thousand kilometers. Its source was in the northernmost Ice Pole Province, where sixty percent of the province's area was covered by glaciers. Every spring and summer, the glaciers melted and flowed into the Azure River, extending all the way to the distant sea. The river surface was wide; even at its narrowest point, it was nearly a hundred meters wide, and at its widest, it reached several thousand meters. It earned its name from its clear water and swift currents, nurturing the populace of several nations and dozens of provinces. Although it occasionally caused some degree of flooding, due to proper governance by various countries, the people living by the river were able to live peaceful and tranquil lives, existing by the river.\n\nThe steep mountain peak's summit had an area of less than ten square meters. Suddenly, a fiery red light appeared on the ground. It was a light point that moved rapidly, outlining a red hexagram in the blink of an eye. The temperature at the summit rose sharply, and above the hexagram, heat created shimmering, water-like ripples.\n\nThe ripples quivered slowly, and the red light suddenly flared brightly. The surrounding magic elements seemed to be joyfully singing. Amidst strong elemental fluctuations, a gray figure quietly appeared.\n\nThe figure stumbled, tumbling out of the fiery red magic array, nearly falling to the ground. It was a child, a child who looked about ten years old. He was none other than Rong Nian Bing, who had sought out his mother with his father three days earlier.\n\nHis handsome young face revealed a look of terror. His short golden hair appeared somewhat disheveled. His legs gave way, and he plopped down onto the ground, gasping for breath. \"Dad, Mom, why... why is it like this?\" Tears streamed down his face. The pain of losing a loved one would be difficult for anyone to bear, let alone a mere ten-year-old child.\n\nAfter crying for a while, the mentally exhausted Nian Bing curled up behind a rock on the mountaintop and fell into a deep sleep. His future at this moment was uncertain; he simply didn't know what he should do. Faint blue and red lights flashed in his arms and disappeared. The surrounding fire and ice elemental energies rapidly condensed towards his young body. This strange process lasted for about the duration of a meal before quietly disappearing.\n\nNo one knew how much time had passed. Intense shaking and pain roused Nian Bing from his slumber. Three slender figures stood not far from him. The intense pain in his chest made him cough out loud, and a trickle of fresh blood flowed from the corner of his mouth. A shoe print stained with yellow dirt appeared on the chest of his gray cloth tunic.\n\nAll three of them wore blue magic robes. Their blue long hair seemed to meld with them as one, as if their bodies were condensed from ice, giving off an inexpressible sense of coldness. They appeared to be in their thirties or forties. The one in the center had three snowflakes carved from nail-sized blue crystals embroidered on the left chest of his magic robe. The ones accompanying him on either side were clearly of a lower rank, with only one snowflake.\n\n\"A fire-based instantaneous movement magic array scroll. Too bad it was used by a child; the residual aura is too obvious,\" the central magician said indifferently.\n\nSeeing these three people, Nian Bing's handsome young face instantly twisted. \"You... ah! It's you, you bad people! Give me back my mom, give me back my dad!\" Not knowing where he found the strength, Nian Bing struggled to scramble up from the ground and rushed towards the person in the center. At this moment, he had forgotten that he possessed the abilities of a junior magician; in his impulse, only instinct remained.\n\n\"Little bastard, are you looking for death?\" The magician on the left waved his right hand, and a water bullet three inches in diameter instantly shot out, directly striking the young boy's chest. The water bullet was just the most common Tier 1 magic; its attack power was not strong. Nian Bing grunted, stumbled back a few steps, and plopped down onto the ground. His hand, scraped against a nearby rock while trying to steady himself, sustained several bleeding cuts.\n\nThe magician in the center glared at his companion. \"Enough. He's just a child. I don't want him to suffer too much pain.\"\n\n\"Yes, honored Priest of Ice and Snow.\" The attacking magician replied and quickly stepped aside.\n\nThe Priest of Ice and Snow looked at Nian Bing and said calmly, \"Child, I originally didn't wish to harm you, but alas, you are their child. For the dignity of the Ice God Tower, you cannot continue to exist. Hand over the Stone of the Ice Snow Goddess, and I will give you a swift end.\" Given his status, he naturally wouldn't search by hand, but his commanding tone exuded an invisible authority.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nXiao San has kept his promise. The other side just finished transmission, so here are two chapters first. From now on, for the public chapters, there will be at least two chapters daily, with no upper limit.",

    "content": "Today's second chapter. Everyone who has finished reading, you can switch over here now. Please, brothers and sisters who support Xiao San, collect and vote more. Thank you.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI uploaded the wrong one just now, I'm really sorry.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNian Bing slowly stood up. Despite his young age, a cold, stern look appeared in his eyes. Deep hatred burned in his heart. \"The Ice God Tower's dignity? My father said that the Ice God Tower, with its flashy exterior, is just a pile of garbage. You want to get back the Ice and Snow Goddess' Stone? Don't even dream of it. I wouldn't give it to you even if I died. That was the last thing my mother gave me. All of you, go to hell!\" Without any warning, he simultaneously swung both fists forward. Red on the left, blue on the right, two beams of light, each carrying a different aura, enveloped the three Ice and Snow Mages in front of him. They were Fireball and Waterball, two Level 1 spells that could be used without incantations. The simultaneous appearance of ice and fire was an achievement he himself had not anticipated.\n\nA flicker of light appeared in the Ice and Snow Priest's eyes. He quickly chanted a few simple characters, and a soft water wall appeared out of thin air. The collision of water and fire created a mist. His heart suddenly stirred, and he inwardly thought, \"This is bad.\" By the time he wanted to act again, it was already too late.\n\nHis young body plummeted from the peak. The moment he leaped off the cliff, there was no hesitation. With a splash, his figure vanished into the turbulent river, only causing faint ripples. Nian Bing's voice still echoed in the ears of the three Ice and Snow Mages. They finally understood what he meant by not surrendering the Ice and Snow Goddess' Stone even in death.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Priest took a few steps forward, reaching the edge of the cliff, and let out a soft sigh. \"What a determined child.\"\n\n\"Ice and Snow Priest-sir, how is this possible? How old is he? How can he instantly cast two spells? And conflicting ones at that?\" The Ice and Snow Mage on the left looked at the turbulent river below in astonishment.\n\nThe Ice and Snow Priest calmly said, \"That's not because his magical power is high. It's because he possesses not only Ice Shishu's Ice and Snow Goddess' Stone but also Rong Tian's Flame God's Stone. While he cannot yet utilize the true capabilities of these two supreme gems, it's not surprising that they can activate simple, elementary spells. However, ice and fire are naturally opposing, yet the two elementary spells he used simultaneously seemed to have no conflict with each other. This is truly perplexing to me. It seems this child possesses extraordinary talent in magic.\"\n\nThe mage on the right said bitterly, \"What a pity. We don't have enough magic power to freeze the turbulent river, otherwise, we would surely obtain these two precious gems. Ice and Snow Priest-sir, what about our mission? Earlier, we should have just searched him directly.\"\n\nThe Ice and Snow Priest glanced at him, the chill in his eyes made the mage shiver all over, and he dared not say anything more.\n\n\"Remember, to cultivate magic, one must first cultivate the mind. Without a calm heart, your magical abilities will never reach the higher realms. This mission has ended in failure, and I will bear all responsibility myself. Let's go back. Oh, great Ice and Snow Goddess! Please lend me your wrath, and guide us to the lost shore.\" At some point, a magic staff about a meter long had appeared in his hand. The staff's body was a crystalline blue, its material unknown. The staff head, in the manner of an eight-clawed demon's grasp, as if stars surrounding the moon, protruded eight elven-like fingers, clutching a transparent gem.\n\nIce and Snow Storm, a Level 6 large-scale Ice-element magic spell, with ordinary attack power but extremely wide range.\n\nSnowflakes fluttered, causing the air temperature to drop sharply. This was the environment Ice and Snow Mages liked most. In the dim sky, wind and snow raged. The Ice and Snow Priest pointed his staff forward. \"Let's go.\"\n\nThe two Ice and Snow Mages responded, their bodies enveloped in a faint blue light, rising like snowflakes, drifting with the wind and snow towards the Ice God Tower. The Ice and Snow Storm was most suitable for Ice and Snow Mages for short-distance flight. Although they couldn't sustain flight like Wind Mages, their speed over short distances was a few points faster than wind magic.\n\nHis companions left. The Ice and Snow Priest, Bing Lu, cast his gaze upon the wide Azure Sky River for the last time and sighed softly. \"Let everything be decided by heaven, Ice Shishu. All I could do for you was this much.\" With his level of magical power, he could have forcibly killed Nian Bing as the boy escaped. However, the good intention in his heart prevented him from doing so, leaving that poor, orphaned child a final chance at survival.\n\n…\n\nCha Ji walked from the Peach Blossom Forest towards the bank of the Azure Sky River. He glanced at the fishing net in his hand and muttered to himself, \"Time to improve life a bit. Eating vegetables every day, no matter how delicious, still leaves the body lacking in nutrition. I'll net a few green carp to nourish my old body.\"\n\nThe fresh air was slightly damp, and breathing it in felt exceptionally comfortable. Cha Ji, already fifty-seven this year, had lived here for ten years and was intimately familiar with everything around him.\n\nWith trembling hands, he managed to grasp the fishing net firmly. Using his arm to guide his hand, he cast the net out. Although it only went out four or five meters, for the Azure Sky River, which was rich in fish, as long as he waited patiently, he would certainly not return empty-handed. He secured the fishing net beside him, tying one of the lines to his wrist. Cha Ji sat down, leaning against a large tree nearby. In the hot summer, resting in the shade of a tree was indeed a good choice.\n\nHe had just settled down when the fishing line in Cha Ji's hand suddenly vibrated violently. His closed eyes opened, a sharp glint flashing through them. \"It can't be this good of luck. Usually, I have to wait a while before getting anything. Oh no, why isn't it a fish? My poor fishing net!\" When his gaze fell upon the river, what he saw was a piece of wood. The wood wasn't large, about a meter long and as thick as a human leg, and it was entangled in his not-very-sturdy fishing net. He didn't even need to look closely to know that his fishing net was probably ruined.\n\nCha Ji hadn't had time to lament his poor luck when he discovered a pair of slender arms on the piece of wood. Someone was there. Someone was in the river. Daring not to delay, he swiftly wrapped the fishing line around his leg and strode further along the bank. Using his leg strength, he pulled the piece of wood and the person along with it to the shore.\n\n\"No—\" Nian Bing abruptly sat up, gasping for breath. A look of uncertainty and surprise filled his eyes.\n\nThe sound of birds chirping clearly reached his ears. Soft light shone on him, bringing a sense of warmth. He shook his head hard, his mind settling a little. From the feeling of warmth, he knew he wasn't dead. His heartbeat gradually steadied as he observed his surroundings. This appeared to be a small wooden hut. Apart from the bed he was on, there seemed to be no other extensive furnishings. There was a lot of dust in the room, clearly indicating it wasn't cleaned often.\n\n\"You're awake.\" A weary voice sounded. The wooden door opened with a grating sound, and a person walked in from outside.\n\nNian Bing subconsciously curled his body inward. \"You, who are you?\"\n\n\"Your savior.\" Cha Ji walked to the bedside and sat down, placing the bowl he held on the wooden table beside him. He smiled as he looked at Nian Bing, thinking inwardly, \"What a handsome child.\"\n\nRecalling everything that had happened in the past few days, Nian Bing's body trembled slightly. He subconsciously touched his chest, and the hard object was still there. Only then did he let out a sigh of relief. He cautiously asked, \"Did you save me?\" As he spoke, he observed the old man in front of him. He looked to be in his sixties, his black hair already streaked with white. Wrinkles showed the weathering of time, and a kind smile adorned his very ordinary face.\n\nCha Ji said as a matter of course, \"Of course it was me. Otherwise, who did you think it would be? Consider yourself lucky that you managed to hold onto that piece of wood. Do you know how much effort it took for me to bring you back? You really wore this old man out. Little fellow, eat something. That broken piece of wood of yours ruined my fishing net. Now there's only vegetable congee to drink.\"\n\nEarlier, being in shock, Nian Bing hadn't felt much about his body. Now, hearing Cha Ji tell him to eat, he realized his stomach was practically glued to his back. At the time, after he leaped into the Azure Sky River, the severe pain from being slapped by the water's surface nearly made him faint. He frantically grabbed with both hands, and miraculously, after being carried hundreds of meters downstream, he managed to grasp a piece of wood. A strong will to survive made him cling tightly to the wood. It was also his good fortune that the Azure Sky River was extremely wide, with no prominent rocks, which allowed him to be saved after colliding with Cha Ji's fishing net.\n\nHe cautiously glanced at Cha Ji, then picked up the bowl of vegetable congee that hadn't emitted any aroma. When he saw the contents of the bowl, he couldn't help but be stunned. The white congee looked extremely thick, seemingly shimmering with a faint, translucent sheen. Pieces of green vegetable, though not uniform in size, were scattered within the white congee, and one could almost feel the vitality contained within them. As he drew closer, the entire bowl of congee gave off a faint, fresh fragrance, making Nian Bing's appetite surge. How could he know that, originally, such a seemingly ordinary bowl of vegetable congee had the esteemed reputation of \"Emerald Jade Congee\" in the continent's culinary world, something not available to ordinary people? Its key lay not in the ingredients, but in the method of preparation.",
