Everyone, don't forget to add this book to your collection!\n\n  ————————————————————-\n\n  As the weakest kingdom on the entire Longqinus Continent, Arcadia's territory was undoubtedly also the smallest. Situated at the southeastern tip of the continent, it was bordered by the vast, boundless sea to the east and south, while two powerful empires hemmed it in on the other two sides. If not for the intervention of a place called Falan in the center of the continent, a country like Arcadia would have likely been destroyed long ago. And our story begins in Arcadia's capital, Luna City.\n\n  The scorching sun was like a fire, especially in the southern part of the Longqinus Continent. The sun in the sky seemed so close it brought with it a searing, scalding airflow. Everyone bathed in the sunlight felt as if their bodies had turned to hot coals, all of them dripping with sweat. Though it was still morning, the streets of Luna City were filled with a listless air. No wonder some said that the reason the two powerful empires, Landias and Bopang, had not carved up Arcadia was not just due to Falan's intervention, but also because this place was truly the hottest furnace on the entire continent.\n\n  Of course, there were exceptions. At this moment, a hale and hearty old man arrived before the doors of Luna City's Magic Guild.\n\n  His white magic robe was without a single wrinkle, as upright as the man himself. A dense network of wrinkles showed the old man's age, and his long, silver-white hair was neatly combed back. The old magician was very tall, at least half a head taller than the average Arcadian. In his equally wrinkled right hand, he held a long, slender staff. Although the staff was currently propped on the ground, no one would ever assume he was relying on this purely wooden staff to support his body. The reason was his eyes, the old magician's eyes. They were a pair of black eyes, as deep as an abyss, yet incomparably clear. The old magician's eyes were slightly narrowed, but a faint, keen light would still inadvertently flash from them when they opened and closed.\n\n  \"Praise Falan. Greetings, respected Mr. Magician. May I ask if there is anything I can help you with?\" Piello had just walked out of the Magic Guild when he saw this old magician. Although the old man wore no valuable attire or magical items, and it was impossible to discern his rank from the lack of elemental fluctuations on his robe and his entire person, as a Yellow-rank, mid-tier magician who had trained at the Luna City Magic Guild for over twenty years, he trusted his instincts. Only those who wished to show off would display their magic rank as a sigil on their robes. And this old magician before him, who looked to be at least seventy, how could he possibly be a magician of the lowest rank? What's more, on his wrinkled forehead, there wasn't a single drop of sweat.\n\n  \"Praise Falan.\" The old magician's voice was very soft and pleasant. Though a bit low, it gave one the feeling of being bathed in a spring breeze, seeming to cool even the scorching air by a few degrees. \"I come from Falan. Please take me to the guild's acting president.\"\n\n  Piello's body suddenly stiffened, his keen eyes filled with shock and ecstasy. *From Falan? He came from Falan.* On the Longqinus Continent, even the most common peasant would understand the meaning behind that sentence. The president of the Luna City Magic Guild had been deceased for over two years. As the main Magic Guild of the Arcadia Kingdom, the position of president had remained vacant all this time. He came from Falan, could it be...\n\n  What is the most revered profession on the Longqinus Continent? The magician. Perhaps some might not believe in the existence of gods, but no one failed to revere magicians. Falan was a stretch of plains on the Longqinus Continent. Its area was about half the size of the Arcadia Kingdom, but despite its fertile lands, not a single country dared to have designs on it, for it was the holy land of magicians. Falan was an object of faith for almost every country, with the exception of the extreme northern wastelands of the Longqinus Continent.\n\n  Falan was both the holy land of magicians and the place they feared most. Apart from the Falan Legion that guarded it, only magicians could enter. Entering Falan was not too difficult, but leaving Falan was something most magicians dared not hope for. Without the strength of Blue-rank or higher, one was not permitted to leave.\n\n  The ranks of magicians, from lowest to highest, were Magician, Intermediate Magician, Advanced Magician, Great Magician, Magus, Sorcerer, and Archmage. No matter the type of magic, the ranks shared the same colors, graded by the colors of the rainbow. The lowest rank, Magician, corresponded to the first color of the rainbow, red. The ranks followed in order from there. And Blue represented the rank of Sorcerer. The first six colors of the rainbow were each divided into low, mid, and high tiers. A Yellow-rank, mid-tier magician like Piello was an Intermediate Advanced Magician. As for the final color of the rainbow, violet, it was divided into nine tiers. Even among Archmages of the Violet-rank, the difference in strength between tiers was undoubtedly enormous. There was another reason why Falan could become the holy land of magicians: within Falan, there were a total of seven Mage Towers, and within each tower resided a powerful ninth-tier, Violet-rank magician. They were the pinnacle of existence on Longqinus.\n\n  Therefore, on the Longqinus Continent, it was very easy to distinguish a person's strength. Any magic or battle aura was differentiated by color; the color displayed during release perfectly revealed the user's own power.\n\n  \"Please, this way, sir.\" Piello stepped aside with utmost deference.\n\n  A faint smile appeared on the old magician's face. He gave Piello a slight nod before following him into the Magic Guild.\n\n  The guild hall was suffused with immense magical elements. On the floor, a magical hexagram inlaid with mithril gave off a faint silver light. The interior of the guild appeared quite empty, a fact closely related to the scarcity of magicians. In a small kingdom like Arcadia, the number of magicians could only be described as deserted. Thus, although the guild held a high status in the kingdom, it remained quiet.\n\n  Piello did not keep the old magician waiting long. In a short while, he had invited another elderly magician out from the inner guild. This magician was dressed in a cyan magic robe and appeared to be of a similar age to the visiting old magician.\n\n  \"Praise Falan. Greetings, magician from a distant land. I am the Acting President of the Arcadia Kingdom's Magic Guild, the fire magician Diara.\" As he spoke, Diara slowly bowed to the white-robed old magician. At the same time, a ball of pale cyan flame erupted from his right hand, displaying his precise rank: Cyan-rank, low-tier magician. This was the most崇高的禮儀.¹ One must know that with Diara's status in Arcadia, he was not required to do this even when meeting the king. There was only one reason for his immense respect: the white-robed magician before him was from Falan.\n\n  \"Praise Falan. My name is Qin Shang. I come from Falan. This is Falan's letter.\" Qin Shang transferred the wooden staff to his left hand and extended his right hand in front of Diara. A faint light flashed, and a parchment scroll had already appeared in his palm.\n\n  Both Piello and Diara were stunned by the scene before them, because they saw clearly that although the light in Qin Shang's hand was very faint, its color was—Violet.\n\n  With hands trembling slightly, Diara took the parchment scroll and slowly unrolled it. There was nothing on the scroll; it was just a blank sheet. But Diara was not surprised by this. His gaze subconsciously shifted to Qin Shang before him.\n\n***\n*¹ A magician's highest rite/etiquette.*",

    "content": "Qin Shang swiped his right hand, and another faint purple light covered the parchment scroll. Instantly, enveloped by that purple glow, a line of text appeared. Di Yala read it aloud, his voice trembling with excitement, \"By order, Qin Shang, a First-Order Purple-rank Divine Musician, is to assume the position of President of the Arcadia Magicians Guild. Ah—you're a Divine Musician?\" This time, Di Yala and Pirlo's surprise turned into utter shock.\n\nDivine Musicians, a branch of mental-type magicians who cast magic by playing musical instruments, could be considered the noblest among the continent's magicians, but also the most useless.¹ This was because it was extremely difficult for a Divine Musician to cultivate their skills beyond the Yellow rank. At best, they could only play a minor role in boosting morale on the battlefield. Consequently, only the daughters of high nobles or the princesses of various kingdoms ever showed interest in learning this noble yet useless form of magic. And yet, the old magician before them was a Divine Musician—a Purple-rank Divine Musician. Di Yala simply couldn't believe his eyes. However, the ancient symbol in the bottom-right corner of the scroll, encircled by a silver hexagram, was the mark of the Tower of Illusion, one of the Seven Towers of Falan. It was clear that this magician named Qin Shang had arrived only after passing the Tower of Illusion's trials. And the purple magical energy he had released was so undeniably real.\n\nA look of reminiscence crossed Qin Shang's aged face. He turned slightly to face the northwest. Everything he had experienced at the Tower of Illusion was something he would never forget. *That* was true magic!\n\nDi Yala quickly composed himself. An edict from Falan could not be forged. He hastily rolled up the parchment scroll and respectfully presented it to Qin Shang. \"Di Yala, with Pirlo, greets you, President.\"\n\nQin Shang took back the scroll and asked, \"How many magicians are there in Arcadia right now?\"\n\nHearing Qin Shang's question, Di Yala couldn't help but wear a bitter expression. \"In Arcadia, including myself, there is one Cyan-rank magician, three Green-rank magicians, twenty-four Yellow-rank magicians, sixty-seven Orange-rank magicians, and two hundred and thirteen Red-rank magicians. Most of them have joined the army. Only a dozen or so remain here at the guild.\"\n\nA hint of surprise appeared on Qin Shang's face. \"So few? Although cultivating magic is a lengthy process, with Arcadia's population of tens of millions, can there really be only three hundred magicians? As I recall, magicians in other kingdoms aren't nearly so scarce!\"\n\nDi Yala sighed. \"Of course, we didn't always have so few. Our Kingdom of Arcadia has always been known for its fire-type magicians. But now, as the kingdom's power wanes, any magician with a bit of strength has left for the two great neighboring empires. Those willing to stay, well... However, it is a blessing that you have come. You are a Purple-rank Archmage! It has been hundreds of years since a powerhouse of the Purple rank has appeared in Arcadia. I am certain that under your leadership, the Arcadia Magicians Guild will grow strong once more.\" Despite his age, he couldn't help but grow excited as he spoke, his gaze on Qin Shang becoming almost fanatical.\n\nJust then, a pleasant and elegant voice called from outside, \"Is Master Di Yala in?\"\n\nDi Yala paused, a slight smile touching his lips. Murmuring an apology to Qin Shang, he went to greet the visitor. A moment later, a young woman followed him back into the hall.\n\nThe woman was exceptionally beautiful, with long black hair and a fair complexion. She wore a long, jade-green dress, and her face, though slightly full, did not detract from her noble bearing. Whether walking or standing, she carried herself with a ramrod-straight posture, as if her slender waist could never bend. In her arms, she held a swaddled infant, from which the even sounds of breathing emerged; the baby inside was apparently fast asleep.\n\nUpon seeing this woman, Qin Shang's eyes lit up. His slightly narrowed eyes opened wide, a sharp light gleaming within.\n\nThe woman immediately felt his searing gaze. Her elegant brows knitted together slightly, and a cyan light flashed deep in her eyes as she looked back at him. The instant their gazes met, the light in her eyes flickered and grew hazy. When she recovered a moment later, her face paled, and she subconsciously hugged the swaddled baby a little tighter.\n\nDi Yala, his thoughts still in a jumble, failed to notice any of this. He said to the woman, \"Mei Ying, where is Ye Zhong? How come he didn't accompany you? You've only just finished your postpartum confinement, haven't you?\"\n\nMei Ying subconsciously took half a step sideways and smiled. \"Oh, him? He's been training hard on his Dou Qi lately, so I came alone. Master, our child is now one month old, and I must trouble you to give him your blessing.\" A mage's blessing was the best protection for a newborn. The higher the rank of the mage who performed it, the healthier the child would grow, regardless of magical affinity.\n\nDi Yala laughed heartily and readily agreed. \"Of course! Didn't I tell you I would bless your child once he was born? Oh, right, let me introduce you. This is our new Guild President, Master Qin Shang, who has come from Falan.\" Despite seeing an old acquaintance, he hadn't forgotten the new president beside him.\n\nMei Ying, seemingly unable to forget Qin Shang's earlier stare, offered only a faint curtsy. \"Praise Falan. Greetings, Master,\" she said coolly.\n\nJust as Qin Shang opened his mouth to speak, a piercing cry erupted from the swaddling clothes. A pair of arms, as white and tender as lotus roots, poked out and waved gently, as if the baby were trying to struggle free from its mother's embrace.\n\nThe words on the tip of Qin Shang's tongue died. He had seen the baby's tiny hands. Those small, fair hands each had only four fingers; both were missing their little fingers. For the first time since arriving at the Magicians Guild, his composure shattered, and the sheer magnitude of his reaction stunned everyone present.\n\nWith a single, arrow-like step, Qin Shang was before Mei Ying. His ancient face was flushed with excitement as he raised trembling hands, reaching for the pair of tiny, crystal-white hands that were as delicate as spring scallions. His swift movement was less that of a magician and more that of a warrior.\n\n\"What do you think you're doing?\" Mei Ying snapped. With two strange, successive steps backward, she evaded him. Fast as Qin Shang was, his hands closed on nothing but an afterimage.\n\nHe didn't give chase. His gaze remained fixed on those tiny, pink hands. He stood there in a daze, forgetting even to lower his outstretched arms. \"Eight fingers... born with eight fingers. To think someone could actually be born with eight fingers. A genius! This is an absolute genius!\"\n\nDi Yala, startled by this scene, rushed forward to stand between Mei Ying and Qin Shang. \"Please, don't misunderstand!\" he said anxiously. \"Master Qin Shang, what... what is this?\"\n\nQin Shang was, after all, a newly ascended Archmage. The expression on his face gradually calmed. He looked down, contemplating the mithril-inlaid magic hexagram on the floor for a long moment. Then, a look of pure ecstasy lit up his eyes. He clapped his hands together, as joyful as a child. \"Praise Falan,\" he declared. \"Yes. This is it.\"\n\nHe looked up to meet Mei Ying's wary yet curious gaze. Qin Shang smiled faintly. It had to be said that, despite his wrinkled face, his refined clothes and grooming gave him a certain graceful air. \"Miss Mei Ying,\" he said, \"you came today to receive a magical blessing for your child, did you not?\"\n\nMei Ying nodded subconsciously.\n\nQin Shang turned his gaze to Di Yala. \"In that case,\" he announced, \"I will be the one to bless this child.\"\n\n***\n¹TN: The original term is 雞肋 (jīlèi), meaning \"chicken rib\"—something of little value that is still a pity to throw away. It implies something is impractical or not worth the effort.",

    "content": "Diara was stunned. After all, in this world, it was already an incredibly difficult thing for a one-month-old infant to receive a mage's blessing, let alone one performed by a Purple-ranked Grand Magus. Only the princes and princesses of great kingdoms could possibly have such an honor!\n\n\"This...\" Diara looked toward Mei Ying. At sixty-seven years of age, he could naturally see the change in Qin Shang's expression after seeing Mei Ying's child, and thus couldn't help but hesitate. Given his relationship with Mei Ying and her husband, if their child came to any harm here, how could he possibly explain it?\n\nA faint iciness appeared in Mei Ying's gaze, making the pride in her bones all the more apparent. \"Your Excellency, Guild Master, I wish to know why.\"\n\nThe tranquility in Qin Shang's eyes had already vanished the moment he saw those little hands. A profound emotion surfaced in his eyes, and even his voice gained a magnetic quality. \"Because of his hands. They are the most perfect pair of hands I have ever seen in this world. Lady Mei Ying, I have no ill intent.\"\n\nThe iciness Mei Ying displayed gradually faded. Indeed, although this Grand Mage Qin Shang's eyes were filled with an ardent light, the aura he emitted held not a trace of malice. On the contrary, it felt warm and approachable. However, the moment she heard Qin Shang mention her son's hands, her expression turned exceptionally grim. \"Master Qin Shang, why would you say my child's hands are the most perfect in the world? Are you mocking me?\"\n\nA person has two hands, each with five fingers. For a warrior, every single finger is extremely important. Although the child in Mei Ying's arms was only missing his left and right little fingers, it had a tremendous impact on his ability to hold a weapon. He wouldn't even be able to grip a longsword tightly. What parent doesn't wish for their child to be perfect? Mei Ying was no exception. But while everything else about the child was fine, his congenital eight fingers had once left her heartbroken. Eight fingers had already decided it: her child could never become a master swordsman. And yet, that was her entire family's hope!\n\n\"Oh, no, no. Praise be to Fa Lan! I swear in the name of Fa Lan, I had absolutely no intention of mocking you.\" Qin Shang's eyes, full of emotion, gazed at the infant who was still struggling and crying. The lines on his face were surprisingly soft. \"Perhaps, to others, these hands are flawed. But to someone like me, they are absolutely perfect. In a moment, you will understand.\"\n\nUnder the watchful eyes of Mei Ying, Diara, and Piluo, Qin Shang slowly sat down cross-legged. A flash of light emanated from his right hand. Mei Ying vaguely saw that it was a ring on Qin Shang's right little finger—a Spatial Ring, one of the most important magical artifacts for a mage.\n\nA reddish-brown ancient zither¹ quietly appeared, resting flat upon his lap. Its seven strings shimmered with a faint silver luster. Qin Shang placed his hands on the strings, and his entire demeanor underwent a heaven-and-earth-shattering transformation.\n\nHis aged face became serene and humble, and his entire being filled with the breath of life. It was as if he had been sitting there since time immemorial, maintaining that very posture. White robes, silver hair, ancient zither—the moment his hands touched the strings, his entire person merged completely with everything in the Mage Guild's hall. Unconsciously, everyone's gaze became fixed upon him.\n\nHis left hand hovered, resting on the body of the zither above the strings without touching them. His right thumb and index finger formed a light clasp, while his middle and ring fingers rested gently on the fifth string. His thumb released, and his index finger plucked the seventh string through the air, drawing forth a clear, humming tone. The clear note was deep and rich, its resonance lingering gracefully. In that instant, the very air seemed to freeze, and the infant's cries quietly ceased.\n\nIn his swaddling clothes, a pair of large, pitch-black eyes turned toward the source of the sound, and he let out a few soft coos.\n\nWhether it was a high-level mage like Piluo, a Magus like Diara, or a warrior like Mei Ying, upon hearing that clear note, it was as if all the impurities in their bodies had been purged in an instant. Their bodies and minds felt unprecedentedly clear, their blood flowed freely, and they were overcome with an indescribable sense of comfort.\n\n\"Withered Wood Dragon's Cry... You are...\" The hidden enmity in Mei Ying's eyes vanished completely at that moment. Looking at Qin Shang, she revealed a mixture of surprise and delight.\n\nQin Shang did not answer, only offering a faint smile as both his hands began to move. His left hand pressed lightly, his right hand gently plucked, and a moving melody drifted forth. The zither's notes were delicate and subtle, his fingering imperceptibly controlling the tempo—light and slow, urgent and heavy. The lively rhythm, with its recurring, tender refrains, was like a chant that went straight to the heart. A faint purple light began to emanate quietly from the silver strings in time with the movement of his hands. Rings of a pale purple halo enveloped the hall but did not spread further.\n\nA mage's spiritual power is undoubtedly far greater than that of an ordinary person, yet at this moment, both Piluo and Diara were lost in the soul-stirring melody. Their eyes were filled with joy and bewilderment, and they had completely forgotten where they were.\n\nMei Ying was the only one who remained lucid. She didn't know why she, whose spiritual power was far inferior to a mage's, was still able to maintain her awareness. She could see clearly that the faint purple light was converging in one direction—and that direction was precisely the swaddled infant in her arms.\n\nThe infant had long since stopped crying. When Mei Ying looked down at her baby, she was astonished to find that, at some point, her son had begun to smile. His small, four-fingered hands waved gently in the air. Amidst the delicate and subtle music, the sequence of his hands' movements actually matched the rhythm of the melody. And the faint purple light was quietly seeping into his body, causing some strange changes to begin within him.\n\nCould this be real? Mei Ying felt as if she were in a waking dream, and even after the song quietly ended, she had yet to recover.\n\n\"A winding tune like fine brocade, like flowing wine on the fingertips. The strings are loosened to tune the jeweled posts, the pipes sob over silver reeds.² Using the Spring Thunder Zither to play this song, 'Green Water,' was most suitable for cleansing this child's body and mind.\" Qin Shang's voice pulled Mei Ying back from her dreamlike state. Looking up, she saw a soul-piercing silver light glinting in Qin Shang's eyes; the ancient zither that had been on his lap was gone. She looked down again at the baby in her arms. He had already fallen asleep, his even breathing a delightful sound. His skin seemed to have become more lustrous and radiant, and a sweet smile graced his beautiful little face.\n\n\"A genius. He is an absolute genius. My judgment was not mistaken. Even though he is merely a month old, he can still perceive the true beauty in my music. I truly envy you of the Bamboo Sect! Why wasn't he born into my house? Now you should understand why I praised his perfect little hands, shouldn't you? For a zitherist, the little fingers of both hands are 'forbidden fingers'; they serve no purpose at all. For those who learn the zither later in life, the extraneous little fingers can even cause a certain degree of interference. As a Divine Musician, I know far, far too much about these things. There was once a legend of a person with six fingers on each hand, known as the Six-Fingered Zither Devil. That is pure fabrication. To play the zither, eight fingers are sufficient. To be born with eight fingers... what perfection!\" Qin Shang said with a sigh of admiration.\n\n\"Master, who exactly are you...?\" Mei Ying asked tentatively. The pride in her voice had long since vanished, not because of the purple light he emitted, but because of the song 'Green Water,' because of the sound of the Withered Wood Dragon's Cry.\n\nQin Shang said, \"I have come from Fa Lan. If not for the Azure Sea, why would I be here? I had intended to find a disciple to inherit my legacy, but I never expected my favored genius to be one of your Bamboo Sect. Come, take me to see your father-in-law. Ye Li, ah, Ye Li... we haven't seen each other in decades. I wonder if your old bones are still sturdy.\"\n\nMei Ying's eyes flew open in sudden realization. \"Your surname is Qin... Withered Wood Dragon's Cry... You are from the Zither Sect...!\"\n\n***\n¹**ancient zither:** The original term is *guqin* (古琴), a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument.\n²The lines quoted are from the Tang dynasty poem \"The Song of Li Ping's Konghou\" by Li He, describing the powerful, enchanting quality of music.",

Your recommendations and collections are my greatest motivation.\n\n\n\n—————————————————————\n\n\n\nQin Man smiled slightly and made a gesture of silence, \"It seems that I haven't seen it for more than 20 years. This time I really want to have a good conversation with Lao Yeluo.\"\n\n\n\nMei Ying looked at Pirlo and Diyala on the side and asked quietly, \"Master, what should they do?\"\n\n\n\nQin Man coughed lightly, and a purple air flashed in his eyes. The two of Diyala, who were immersed in confusion, woke up and raised their anger. Diyala praised, \"It's so wonderful, it's so wonderful, praise Meifa Blue. This is the first time I know the powerful president of the Shenyin Master. I will ask you more in the future.\"\n\n\n\nQin Dui shook his head and said, \"What you feel is the power of spiritual magic. He doesn't know how to appreciate the difference between the musical spiritual system and the elemental system. \"As he said, he used his body to hold the visual lines of Diyala and Pirlo, and gave Meiying a look.\n\n\n\nMei Ying agreed, \"I thank Master Qin Shi for giving magic blessings to my little brother. If Master has time, I would like to ask Master to visit the Blue Sky Sea, so that my husband and wife can share the same relationship with the landlords. How about it?\"\n\n\n\nQin Dui pointed at the head and said, \"Then I'm not polite.\"\n\n\n\nDiyala said in surprise: \"I like Mei French Blue and Mei Ying, I don't seem to have received such treatment.\"\n\n\n\nMei Ying smiled and said, \"Master Qin Man who will have the chance in the future, please.\"\n\n\n\n  …\n\n\n\nThe blue sky sea means the meaning of the ocean in the green. Bamboo is not the blue sky hollow, so this blue sky sea refers to a dense and prosperous bamboo forest.\n\n\n\nThe location of the Blue Sky Sea is located, and the various green bamboos thirty kilometers away from Luna City formed a different scenery. Between the faint light, what you can see is a green soft light, and every green bamboo stands so proudly.\n\n\n\nFor the Arcadians, the Blue Sky Sea is a strange place, with a large number of fresh bamboos produced here, but no one has ever been able to penetrate deep into the Blue Sky Sea, and no one knows how wide the Blue Sky Sea is. It borders the Kingdom of Arcadian and the Blue Sky in the West. Every person who enters the blue sky will inexplicably walk out of the place he entered after going deeper. No one knows why. Apart from the bamboo forest, there are no other rich specialties, so no one pays attention to it or interferes with it.\n\n\n\nThe temperature in the Blue Sky Sea is very different from that in Luna City, or maybe it is because there are a lot of green bamboos here. As soon as you enter the Blue Sky Sea, the heat in the air will naturally dissipate a lot.Mei Yingyan walked in the bamboo sea with Aizi and Qin Man in her arms, and praised her, \"Forward, your physical strength is really easy to walk such a far path, and she has not shown any fatigue at all. This is the first time I have seen a magician like you.\"\n\n\n\nThirty miles are naturally not a big deal for a warrior, but for a magician, it is just a long journey. If you look carefully, you can find that there is a faint airflow around Mei Ying's swaddle cloth. It is Mei Ying's fighting spirit, protecting her baby son, so as not to be affected by the heat in the air.\n\n\n\nQin Man smiled bitterly, \"You haven't heard that word, but it's useless. As a divine voice, I don't have the acceleration technique that elemental magicians can perform, and I don't want to have anything to do. No matter where I go to the mainland, I need to rely on my two legs. Over time, I will naturally be able to walk a little farther than ordinary people, and my physical strength is stronger than other magicians.\"\n\n\n\nWhile talking, Qin Feng discovered that the bamboo forest in front seemed to be a little illusory, and a kind smile appeared on his face. He broke a bamboo branch from his body, walked forward, and knocked on the bamboo on his body. His knocking speed was fast and slow, creating a special sound wave, and without allowing Mei Ying to lead the way, he walked directly into the deep blue sky sea, which ordinary people say is never crossed, and how can he stop it, as an old guest,\n\n\n\nMei Ying seemed to have guessed it long ago, and she was not surprised. The steps under her feet became a little illusory. She followed Qin Dui slowly and walked into the deep bamboo forest.\n\n\n\n The blue sky sea is close to the center, and a row of bamboo houses are surrounded by bamboos, ten in size. With the swaying bamboo shadows, it looks particularly elegant. Before Mei Ying and Qin Dui come to the bamboo house, an old voice has been conveyed from one of the bamboo houses, \"Ying, why did you bring outsiders? I can't say, you forgot what I said to you.\"\n\n\n\nBefore Mei Ying opened her mouth, Qin Dui smiled and said, \"Okay, your leaves are gone, and no old friends can see you.\"\n\n\n\nThe bamboo house in the middle opened, and a flash-like figure arrived in front of Mei Ying and Qin Duo in an instant. Although it was very fast, it was like a rushing cloud of water, without giving anyone any sudden feeling.\n\n\n\nYe Wei's figure is a little taller than Qin Feng. His gray-white hair was scattered behind him. The folds on his face were obviously much less than Qin Feng. He looked like he was over fifty years old, his waist was straight, and his shiny eyes were filled with a few breaths. The mature man's feeling of slander was revealed on him. When he saw Qin Feng, his big, thick hands immediately grabbed him. Qin Feng didn't hide and let his hands grab his shoulders.\n\n\n\n\"My husband, why did you come to us for more than 20 years, right?\" Ye Yun said excitedly\n\n\n\nQin Feng's calm atmosphere was silent in front of Ye Gu, and made a somewhat funny expression, saying, \"Look at you, you are still so young. I am old or have good cultivation and fighting. Magic is actually too easy for people to grow old.I remember, you are one year older than me.\"\n\n\n\nYe Wu said in a bad mood, \"You are young, my hair is almost white when you don't see me. I'm leaving. Go into the house and say.\" As he said, he pulled Qin Dun and walked in, but he glanced at Mei Ying's son in the process.\n\n\n\nThe arrangement of the bamboo house is very simple, with bamboo couches, bamboo tables, bamboo chairs, and that's all.\n\n\n\n a href=\"http://wwwcmfucom\">Qitou Chinese Network Welcome to read the book friends.

    "content": "The Zodiac's Featured Post Event is about to begin. Brothers, please cast your recommendation votes here before heading over there to snag a featured spot. Including this chapter, there will still be four chapters tomorrow. For friends who haven't added this book to your collection, don't forget to do so. To be honest, in order to write this series, I had to study a thick introductory book on zither studies and a large amount of reference material. Purely theoretical...\n\n——————————————————\n\nYe Li picked up the water jug on the table, poured a cup of clear water, and handed it to Qin Shang. \"This is spring water from beneath my Azure Sky Sea. Have a taste.\"\n\nQin Shang took it and had a sip, praising, \"Crisp and sweet. Not bad. You certainly know how to enjoy life.\"\n\nYe Li sighed. \"It's been over twenty years since we last saw each other. You old fellow, you came looking for me this time for a reason, didn't you? You know I no longer manage the affairs of the Bamboo Sect. Even if something has happened, it has nothing to do with me.\"\n\nQin Shang laughed heartily. \"I haven't even said anything, and you've already washed your hands of it completely. What do you think I came to find you for? This time, I'm not leaving.\"\n\nA trace of surprise flickered in Ye Li's eyes. \"You're not leaving?\"\n\nQin Shang nodded. \"I've just returned from Falan.\"\n\nHearing the word \"Falan,\" Ye Li's expression changed in an instant, his face growing somber. \"You still went. In that case, you've already reached the Purple-rank?\"\n\nQin Shang squinted, looking Ye Li up and down. \"Aren't you the same? How about you let me see?\"\n\nYe Li shot him an annoyed glare. A faint layer of purple energy drifted out from his body—an aura of pride, a stubborn energy. The immense pressure made Qin Shang's eyes flash brightly. \"Good. First-tier. You're first-tier too. It seems neither of us has fallen behind.\"\n\nYe Li said, \"I'm no longer your match. At the same rank, on the Longqinus continent, no magic or Dou Qi can defeat your Zither Magic. You think I don't know that?\"\n\nQin Shang smiled faintly. \"My zither music only reveals its true power after more than a third of the piece has been played. At the same rank, if you can't beat me, can't you run? What could I do to you then? You don't expect me to chase you on foot, do you?\"\n\nYe Li said fiercely, \"At this distance, believe it or not, I could take you out in one move.\"\n\nQin Shang took another leisurely sip of spring water. \"I don't believe you.\"\n\nThe two looked at each other and couldn't help but burst into laughter. It had been a long time since either Qin Shang or Ye Li had been this happy.\n\nAs their laughter subsided, Ye Li said with a serious expression, \"Old friend, tell me honestly, what was your impression of Falan?\"\n\nQin Shang's face fell. He sighed and said, \"You don't need to ask. The Seven Towers of Falan are beyond our imagination. When I passed the trial at the Illusion Tower, I didn't even get to see the Tower Master.\"\n\nHearing his words, Ye Li fell silent for a long time before saying with a touch of melancholy, \"It seems we'll never have any hope.\"\n\n\"No.\" Qin Shang's eyes lit up as if he had thought of something exciting. He shot up from the bamboo chair. \"There is absolutely hope. And it's right in front of us.\"\n\nA fiery gaze erupted from Ye Li's eyes. \"What is it? Tell me, quickly. Is there really hope of contending with the Seven Towers of Falan?\"\n\nQin Shang smiled faintly and sat back down, but didn't speak.\n\nYe Li said with some impatience, \"Stop being so mysterious. Hurry up and tell me, or I'll get physical.\"\n\nQin Shang laughed. \"Same old temper, still so impatient. I really wonder how you managed to cultivate your Bamboo Dou Qi to its current level. After I was assessed in Falan, my Purple-rank status was confirmed, and I was added to Falan's Rainbow List. Before I left, the people of Falan asked me where I would like to be posted. I chose Arcadia. Because you're here, I came. As long as you agree, I can stay here for at least a decade or two.\"\n\nYe Li's expression shifted. He said, somewhat puzzled, \"Old friend, why do I feel like you're setting a trap for me to walk into? Just say what you want to say. What exactly is our hope?\"\n\nQin Shang nodded. \"Alright, I'll be direct. Our hope is your grandson.\"\n\nYe Li was startled. \"Are you sure you're not mistaken? You came back with Ying'er, didn't you see that my grandson was born with only eight fingers? In the future, he'll have difficulty even holding a weapon tightly. How could he possibly become our hope? I just want this child to live a peaceful life, and that's enough.\"\n\nQin Shang pursed his lips. \"That's how you see it. From my perspective, it's completely different. To be born with eight fingers... he is the successor I've dreamed of. Without the influence of the 'forbidden fingers'—the pinkies on his left and right hands—it's a tremendous advantage for zither cultivation. What's more, your grandson has a naturally keen perception of music. As long as you're willing to let him learn the zither from me, he will be our future hope. I'll be frank with you. I chose to come to Arcadia instead of other powerful nations primarily because you are here. You know as well as I do that once our cultivation reaches the Purple-rank, further progress becomes extremely difficult. And for a Divine Music Master, while reaching the Purple-rank allows one to wield powerful Zither Magic, it also comes with a major drawback. So, I came up with a good solution. And this method requires your cooperation.\"\n\nYe Li frowned slightly. \"My cooperation? I practice the Bamboo Sect's Dou Qi. How can I cooperate with you?\"\n\nQin Shang said, \"In Longqinus, there is only precedent for magic to be combined with Dou Qi—so-called dual cultivation of magic and martial arts—but no one has ever surpassed the Blue-rank. Nowadays, mages disdain splitting their focus to practice Dou Qi. The method I've devised, however, uses Dou Qi to enhance Zither Magic, using Dou Qi to expand the range of the sound waves, or even to directly power the sound waves' attacks. Only a Divine Music Master has the potential for such cultivation. And your Bamboo Dou Qi, full of the aura of nature, is the most perfect Dou Qi to complement zither music. I originally came here intending to find a disciple and then persuade you to teach him Bamboo Dou Qi, combining the strengths of both our schools to create a super Divine Music Master who might just break through the limits of the Purple-rank. But just as I arrived and before I had time to settle down and find a disciple, I met your daughter-in-law and grandson. Born with eight fingers! It's a rarity in this world. I will not let such a good opportunity pass. Old friend, I have never begged anyone in my life, but this time, I'm making an exception. I'm asking you, please let your grandson take me as his master.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Qin Shang stood up and gave Ye Li a deep bow, his expression extremely solemn.\n\nYe Li dodged to the side, stating firmly, \"No, I won't agree. He's my only grandson. Although he was born with only eight fingers, I'm still counting on him to inherit my mantle.\"\n\nQin Shang said urgently, \"Didn't you just say you wanted him to be an ordinary person? Why have you changed your mind now?\"\n\nYe Li said, \"An ordinary person of my Bamboo Sect. My grandson is the future Young Sect Master of the Bamboo Sect. If he's whisked away by you to the Zither Sect, what will become of my Bamboo Sect? No, absolutely not.\"\n\nQin Shang said, unwilling to give up, \"Ye Zhong and Mei Ying are still young. Are you worried you won't have more grandsons in the future? A child born with eight fingers might not even appear once in a million people. Old friend, for the sake of our many years of friendship, please just grant me this.\"\n\nYe Li gave a bitter smile. \"It's not that I don't want to, it's that I can't. It's true, Zhong'er and Ying'er are still young, but they can only ever have this one son. Back when Ying'er was giving birth to my precious grandson, she had complications. You should have been able to tell, Ying'er is the daughter of that old plum blossom from the Plum Sect. The old plum blossom and I asked Matriarch Lan Qing herself to deliver the baby. It was thanks to Lan Qing that both mother and child were saved, but Lan Qing also said that Ying'er would be unable to have more children. If you don't believe me, you can go to the Orchid Sect and ask around.\"\n\nHearing Ye Li's words, Qin Shang slumped back into the bamboo chair in dejection. The feeling of having all his hopes turn to dust was definitely not pleasant. For a long time, neither he nor Ye Li spoke, both lost in deep thought. Just then, a clear voice came from outside the door, \"Dad, I heard we have a guest.\"",

    "content": "This is the second chapter for today. There will be another chapter at 5 PM and 8 PM tonight. Friends, feel free to add this to your library and hit me with a barrage of recommendation votes. Thank you.\n\n——————————————————————————-\n\nA tall figure walked in from the doorway. It was a young man, tall and imposing, with handsome, resolute features, bearing a strong resemblance to Ye Li. As he entered, he brought with him a refreshing aura, something unique to the Bamboo Sect's Bamboo Dou Qi. It was none other than Ye Li's son, Ye Zhong.\n\nYe Li said, \"Zhong'er, greet your Uncle Qin.\"\n\n\"Uncle Qin, hello. I heard from Ying'er that you seem to be here for my son?\" Ye Zhong asked after bowing.\n\nA faint glint flickered in Qin Shang's eyes. He smiled and said, \"Zhong'er, the last time I saw you was when you were a child. Not bad, your Bamboo Dou Qi has already reached the first tier of Yellow Bamboo, hasn't it? That's equivalent to the initial stage of the Green rank in the Rainbow system.\"\n\nYe Zhong was clearly uninterested in the topic of his own strength. He asked with some urgency, \"I heard from Ying'er that you believe my son is a genius, a genius for learning Zither Magic, is that right? If it's possible, could I ask you to take him as your disciple?\"\n\nThe light in Qin Shang's eyes flared brightly. Before Ye Li could speak, he hurriedly said, \"Of course, I can! But, your father disagrees.\"\n\nYe Zhong looked at Ye Li, confused. \"Dad, why?\"\n\nYe Li said, slightly angered, \"Get out. This is no place for you to speak. You ask why? He's your only child. If he learns the Zither Sect's things, what will become of our Bamboo Sect?\"\n\nYe Zhong argued back, \"But he was born with eight fingers! He's not suited to inherit the Bamboo Sect's sword arts. Don't you want your grandson to become a powerful expert in the future? Our Bamboo Sect's techniques are difficult for him to learn, so isn't learning the Zither Sect's magic perfect for him? This is a classic case of sectarian prejudice. You always said...\"\n\n\"Get out!\" Ye Li roared, raising a fist and blasting it toward his son. Ye Zhong didn't dare to fight back. With a bang, amidst a blast of purple light, he was sent flying out of the bamboo doorway, a peculiar look in his eyes. Of course, while Ye Li appeared to strike a heavy blow, he had merely used his Dou Qi to push his son out. What father would be willing to truly strike his own son?\n\nQin Shang looked at the fuming Ye Li and said, \"See? Your son is more reasonable than you are, you old bamboo. I was just thinking, how about this: let your grandson learn Zither Magic from me, and at the same time, learn your Bamboo Sect's Dou Qi. In the future, he'll still be considered a member of your Bamboo Sect, with no official ties to my Zither Sect. How about it?\"\n\nYe Li's expression softened slightly. \"On what grounds should I believe you can train my grandson into an expert capable of contending with the Seven Towers of Falan?\"\n\nQin Shang said seriously, \"On the Loneliness Nus continent today, both magic and Dou Qi are ranked according to a seven-colored Rainbow system. But our Eight Sects of the Eastern Dragon are an exception. Whether it's our four magic sects or your four Dou Qi sects, we only have three color transformations in our cultivation process, with each color having nine tiers. Added together, it's the same as the Rainbow system's ranks. Especially the final color, which is also nine tiers of Purple. Therefore, only by cultivating to the Purple level can we avoid having the secrets of our Eight Sects of the Eastern Dragon discovered by the outside world. But without more than fifty years of effort and extraordinary talent, reaching the Purple level is easier said than done. The people of the Loneliness Nus continent only know of Falan's existence. Who even knows of our Eight Sects of the Eastern Dragon?\"\n\nYe Li snorted. \"This is all nonsense. You think I don't know this?\"\n\nQin Shang said, \"Then tell me, what are the three colors and nine tiers of my Zither Sect?\"\n\nYe Li said, \"Isn't it just the Red 'Refined Soul Zither Heart,' the Yellow 'Sword Gall Zither Heart,' and the Purple 'Purple Star Zither Heart'? You're currently at the initial stage of Purple Star Zither Heart. It's more or less the same concept as our Bamboo Sect's Green Bamboo, Yellow Bamboo, and Purple Bamboo—three major realms with twenty-seven tiers of techniques. The only difference is our first realm is Green. It's much better for bluffing people than your Zither Sect's is.\"\n\nQin Shang nodded. \"Correct, it is precisely these three sets of nine, twenty-seven tiers. For our Zither Sect, the cultivation of the nine tiers of Refined Soul Zither Heart is the most crucial. 'To learn the zither, one must first refine the soul.' This purges distracting thoughts from the mind, allowing the zither's sound to penetrate deep into the psyche, gradually enhancing one's comprehension of zither notes and zither power. This is the orthodox cultivation method of the Zither Sect. As long as someone has normal talent, they can generally complete the nine tiers of Refined Soul Zither Heart in about six years. However, this foundation of refining the soul leads to difficulties in advancing later on. How can a *refined* soul compare to a soul that is inherently pure?\"\n\nYe Li said doubtfully, \"I don't quite understand what you mean.\"\n\nA determined light shone in Qin Shang's eyes. \"If you agree to let your grandson become my disciple, then I will not have him begin his training with the Refined Soul Zither Heart, but rather with the 'Innocent Child Zither Heart,' a method no one has ever successfully cultivated.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Ye Li stared at Qin Shang in astonishment. \"You mean the cultivation method recorded in your Zither Sect's *Miraculous Secret Manual*—the one no one has ever successfully cultivated? Are you insane?\"\n\nQin Shang said seriously, \"I'm not insane. In truth, the Innocent Child Zither Heart is the true cultivation path of the Zither Sect, but because its requirements are too demanding and the difficulty of cultivation too great, no one has ever managed to succeed. But your grandson is different. He was born with eight fingers, born with a sensitive perception of music. I believe he can succeed. With a Purple-level expert like me guiding him, there's at least a seventy percent chance. The Innocent Child Zither Heart is far more difficult to cultivate than the Refined Soul Zither Heart, but once successful, it will open the true gates to Zither Heart cultivation. He could even reach the level of Purple Star Zither Heart in a short time. If he works hard, it might even be possible for him to reach the legendary 'Supreme Profound Zither Heart.' Coupled with the Dou Qi support method I've developed, the Seven Towers of Falan will no longer be so fearsome.\"\n\nYe Li said in a deep voice, \"And if you fail?\"\n\nQin Shang said calmly, \"Even if I fail, he will have been cultivating your Bamboo Sect's Dou Qi all along. You can just have him give up the zither and switch to your martial arts; it won't be too late. The Innocent Child Zither Heart does not involve external objects. If I'm not mistaken, while cultivating it, his Dou Qi will advance at a very rapid pace, more than enough to compensate for starting his martial arts training late. Old friend, an opportunity like this for our Eight Sects of the Eastern Dragon might not even come once in a hundred years. Are you truly unwilling to give it a try? As long as you agree, I'm willing to trade anything from my Zither Sect for it.\"\n\nA purple light flashed repeatedly in Ye Li's eyes. He waved his hand and said, \"No need for any trade. I can agree, but you must also agree to three conditions of mine.\"\n\nQin Shang said without hesitation, \"Fine. Name them.\"\n\nYe Li said, \"First, if this succeeds, then when my grandson has grown strong, he will be the joint master of both the Zither and Bamboo Sects.\"\n\nQin Shang nodded. \"That's no problem. As long as he possesses sufficient strength, no one would be able to object. Besides, this is an agreement between the two of us.\"\n\nYe Li said, \"Second, on the condition of success, your Zither Sect's five great famed zithers will all belong to my grandson.\"\n\nQin Shang's eyes went wide as he stared at Ye Li. \"You old codger, you're not greedy at all, are you? Do you have any idea how important our Zither Sect's five famed zithers are? They are existences comparable to divine artifacts.\"\n\nYe Li said lazily, \"If they weren't, I wouldn't even want them. In any case, my grandson will be the future master of your Zither Sect, so what are you being so stingy for? The Phoenix Cry Zither, the Withered Wood Dragon Roar Zither, the Great Sage's Lingering Sound Zither, the Nine Heavens Circling Jade Zither, and that Spring Thunder Zither you use all the time. They're passable, I suppose. Didn't you tell me before? To play a certain piece, one must use a zither that complements it. The greater the harmony between zither and song, the greater the power of the Zither Magic. You haven't forgotten that, have you?\"\n\n\"Extortion! This is blatant extortion!\" Qin Shang said, slightly angered.\n\nYe Li gave a sly laugh. \"So, are you agreeing, or not?\"",

    "content": "This is the third chapter of the day. There will be another update at 8 PM tonight. Friends, feel free to bookmark and hit me with your recommendation votes.¹ Thanks. The protagonist will officially appear in the 8 PM chapter.\n\n***\n\nAfter glaring fiercely at Ye Li, Qin Shang still nodded resignedly, gritting his teeth. \"Fine, I'll agree to it.\"\n\nWith his hands behind his back and his eyes crinkled into a smile, Ye Li said, \"This last condition, well, it's much simpler. Call me Uncle.\"\n\nQin Shang was stunned. \"You...\"\n\nYe Li chuckled. \"Did I say something wrong? Since you're my grandson's master, you're naturally a generation below me. There's nothing wrong with calling me Uncle, is there?\"\n\n\"Well now, you old coot, you're tricking me.\" Qin Shang viciously pounced on Ye Li, completely disregarding the fact that the other was a Violet-rank warrior.\n\nYe Li didn't use any Dou Qi or martial arts techniques either. The two Violet-rank experts, both well over sixty, actually started wrestling with each other right there in the bamboo house, neither giving an inch. Luckily, there wasn't much in the house, so it didn't end up a complete mess.\n\nQin Shang was a magician, after all, and even his physical strength was far inferior to Ye Li's. When he was once again pinned to the ground by Ye Li, he said, exasperated and embarrassed, \"No more, I'm exhausted.\"\n\nYe Li let go of Qin Shang and sat beside him. Seeing him panting heavily, the smile on his face couldn't help but deepen.\n\n\"Old Qin, give my grandson a name. The little guy just passed his first full month² and doesn't have a name yet.\"\n\nQin Shang knew that Ye Li had only now truly agreed. A flash of inspiration struck him, and he said, \"Let's call him Ye Yin Zhu. He inherits my music (音, *yīn*) and your bamboo (竹, *zhú*).\"\n\nYe Li laughed heartily. \"Good, Ye Yin Zhu it is.\"\n\nQin Shang suddenly grabbed Ye Li's beard and said fiercely, \"You were planning to agree all along, weren't you.\"\n\nYe Li nodded without the slightest attempt to hide it. \"Yup!\"\n\nQin Shang said angrily, \"Then why were you giving me such a hard time just now?\"\n\nYe Li snorted. \"It's your fault for coming to me for a favor. That foolish boy, Ye Zhong, doesn't even understand how to maximize benefits. 'Advocating against sectarianism'—those were my own words originally. If I hadn't kicked him out in time, he would have given the game away. How could I have maximized my benefits then? Sect Master of two sects, not bad, not bad at all. A first for the Eight Sects of Eastern Dragon. Hahahaha.\"\n\n\"You...\" Seeing Ye Li's smug expression, Qin Shang finally understood that he had truly been duped, but there was nothing he could do about it.\n\n\"Old Bamboo, I've accepted your conditions. Since you've agreed to let me be your grandson's master, you need to agree to a few conditions of mine as well.\"\n\nYe Li laughed. \"What? Trying to get even so soon?\"\n\nQin Shang retorted peevishly, \"You think I'm like you? This is for Yin Zhu's own good. And of course, you are never to mention that I'm a generation below you again. We'll stick to our own terms of address.\"\n\nSeeing Qin Shang turn serious, Ye Li nodded and said, \"Go on.\"\n\nQin Shang said, \"The cultivation of the Pure Child Qin Heart is extremely difficult. To succeed, Yin Zhu must maintain the heart of a pure child for as long as possible. In other words, he must have as little contact with the outside world as possible. Even you all should have limited contact with him. Other than Bamboo Dou Qi, you cannot teach him any martial arts without my permission. After he turns three, you can only see him once a week, and you must not tell him anything about the outside world. Only with a focused and untainted pure child's heart can he cultivate the Pure Child Qin Heart.\"\n\nYe Li asked, \"So he can never learn martial arts? Without the Bamboo Sect's techniques, how can he become the Sect Master in the future?\"\n\nQin Shang thought for a moment and said, \"It's not that he can never learn them. Just don't teach him any other martial arts for at least fifteen years, to avoid distracting him. If he still can't reach the ninth rank of the Pure Child Qin Heart within fifteen years, then I'm afraid I will have failed.\"\n\nYe Li agreed readily. \"Fine, I promise. How about this? Weren't you worried about the generation issue? Publicly, you'll be his master. But when it's just us, Yin Zhu can call you 'Grandpa' too.\"\n\nQin Shang glanced at Ye Li. \"Now that shows a bit of sincerity.\"\n\nThe two powerful old men, who had never run rampant across the Continent of Longqinus, looked at each other. In each other's eyes, they both saw a glimmer of hope—hope for Ye Yin Zhu's future, and for the future of the Eight Sects of Eastern Dragon...\n\nQin Shang returned to Luna City to make some simple arrangements, and by the next morning, he was back at the Cerulean Sea. This newly appointed President of the Magicians' Guild clearly didn't have the Arcadia Magicians' Guild on his mind. In his heart, nothing was more important than properly training his prodigy disciple, the one born with eight fingers.\n\nAlthough Ye Li was the Sect Master of the Bamboo Sect, only his family lived here in the Cerulean Sea. Ye Li's wife had passed away, so it was just him, his son, his daughter-in-law, and his grandson. Now, with Qin Shang, there was one more person. There were already plenty of bamboo houses, but Qin Shang insisted on not living with them. At his request, Ye Zhong built another bamboo house five hundred meters from their own. For a Green-rank Earth Warrior like him, this was an effortless task.\n\nOn the Continent of Longqinus, the warrior ranks, like the magician ranks, were divided into seven levels corresponding to the seven colors of the rainbow: Warrior, Intermediate Warrior, Advanced Warrior, Earth Warrior, Sky Warrior, Battle Master, and Grand Battle Master. Although the Dou Qi cultivated by the Bamboo Sect had a special color, Ye Zhong had just entered the Yellow Bamboo realm, which was equivalent to the initial stage of the Green rank in the rainbow system, making him an Earth Warrior.\n\nThe bamboo house was simple in construction, but Qin Shang's requirements were extremely strict, covering the angles of certain bamboo stalks and the size and dimensions of the rooms. He even bought some special materials from Luna City to incorporate into it. Only later did Ye Zhong understand that the reason Qin Shang was so exacting with the construction was to achieve the best possible surround-sound effect for his qin music within the house.\n\nTen days passed, and thanks to Ye Zhong's efforts, the bamboo house Qin Shang had requested was finally complete.\n\n\"Have you lost your mind? Yin Zhu just had his first-month celebration. What can he possibly learn now?\" Ye Li's eyes widened as he stared at Qin Shang.\n\nQin Shang, hands behind his back, put on a scornful look as he faced his old friend. \"Who says an infant can't learn? Even if he can't study, can't he listen? Do you think the Pure Child Qin Heart is so easy to cultivate? If we don't start from infancy, before his innate qi has dissipated, how could it possibly succeed?\"\n\nYe Li shook his head repeatedly. \"No, absolutely not. Do you think I don't know the power of your qin music? If my grandson's mind is damaged by the spiritual magic embedded in your notes, I fear he'll become an imbecile.\"\n\nQin Shang retorted peevishly, \"I think *you're* the imbecile. Do you think I care for Yin Zhu any less than you do? He is the greatest hope of my entire life. I would sooner harm myself than ever let him be harmed. Before he's three, he can't learn Dou Qi from you, and before he's five, he can't learn the qin from me. But this period is the most crucial. I will use my qin music to let him form a Qin Heart naturally through daily listening. The child will still need care, so let Ye Zhong and Mei Ying listen alongside him. They can look after the baby, and it will also be beneficial for their own Dou Qi cultivation.\"\n\nA cunning glint appeared in Ye Li's eyes. He kicked his son. \"What are you waiting for? Thank your Uncle Qin. Not just anyone gets to listen to the Qin Sect's *Pei Yuan Jing Xin Qu*.\"³\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\">Qidian Chinese Network (www.cmfu.com) welcomes all readers.

    "content": "This is already the fourth chapter update for today. Xiao San¹ needs the collections and votes of you, my dear book friends. Please, support Xiao San. The more enthusiastic your support, the more motivation Xiao San will have to write. Because of your support, Xiao San has actually made it onto both the click and recommendation rankings, so Xiao San has decided to release at least three chapters tomorrow to show my gratitude.\n\n***\n\nEver since Qin Shang was tricked by Ye Li that day, Ye Zhong’s admiration for his father was absolute. With a sly grin, he quickly pulled Mei Ying, who was holding Ye Yinzhu, forward to offer their thanks.\n\nQin Shang froze, finally realizing he had been duped again. Yet, he was utterly helpless against Ye Li. Pointing a finger at him, he said, \"So you guessed I was going to use the Source-Nourishing Serenity Melody. You! You! I finally understand what a sly old fox you are.\"\n\nThe Source-Nourishing Serenity Melody offered immense benefits to a martial practitioner. The ability to circulate Douqi at high speeds without fear of cultivation deviation and to clear the mind of distracting thoughts were two things any warrior dreamed of. Furthermore, the zither’s music drew upon the elemental energies between heaven and earth, reinforcing the listener’s foundation and greatly accelerating their cultivation speed. As the Zither Sect Master, Qin Shang’s performance of the Source-Nourishing Serenity Melody was not something just anyone could hear.\n\nAnd so, Qin Shang, the new president of the Arcadia Magicians’ Guild, settled down in the Azure Sea. And our little Yinzhu grew up amidst those heavenly sounds, which were like a spring breeze rustling leaves, like autumn water washing over stones...\n\nSix years later.\n\nAs the first ray of sunlight entered the bamboo house, Ye Yinzhu slowly awoke from his state of meditation, accompanied by the deep and gentle notes of a zither. A comfortable, clear feeling throughout his body made him let out a soft groan.\n\nAt six years old, Ye Yinzhu was as handsome as a girl. His black hair cascaded down his back, and his large black eyes shone with spirit. The white robe he wore seemed a bit large, but it did nothing to diminish his aura of worldly grace. Every movement exuded an elegance that even adult nobles might not possess. Though he was just a child, he sat there with an expression as tranquil as a still well, a composure that was truly astonishing for his age. A faint, cyan-and-red aura surrounding his body gradually faded. The cyan light was noticeably denser, while the red light was a slightly deeper shade.\n\nThe zither music ceased. Qin Shang lowered his hands, a hint of fatigue in his expression. \"Yinzhu, it seems your Douqi has improved again.\"\n\n\"It has! Grandpa Qin, when Grandpa came to see me yesterday, he said I seem to have reached the third rank of Green Bamboo.\" Little Yinzhu jumped up from the ground, his face full of childish innocence. He ran to Qin Shang’s side and pleaded, \"Grandpa Qin, isn't it time you taught me a new piece? I've been learning from you for a year, and you've only taught me one song.\"\n\nQin Shang smiled faintly. \"It is not yet time. Yinzhu, you must understand: to master one method is to understand a hundred. Learning many pieces is of little use. Only when you truly comprehend the profound mystery of the Zither's Heart can you continue to improve.\"\n\nSix years had passed, and Qin Shang had poured all his heart and effort into Ye Yinzhu. He spent at least half of every day by the boy’s side, playing the zither for him. Nourished by the music, Ye Yinzhu's elegant and spiritual temperament became increasingly apparent. At the age of three, Ye Yinzhu began cultivating Bamboo Douqi with his grandfather, Ye Li. For a full year, Ye Li used his own vast Douqi to help his grandson clear his meridians, allowing Ye Yinzhu to easily grasp the basics in his early cultivation. When he turned five, Qin Shang officially began to instruct him in the mysteries of Qin Magic. A year had now passed since then. But in that year, Qin Shang had only taught Ye Yinzhu the most basic finger techniques for the guqin and a single, simple melody: \"Green Water.\"\n\n\"But I've already learned it!\" Ye Yinzhu said, dissatisfied.\n\nQin Shang smiled serenely. \"Have you really learned it? Very well, come with me.\" Stretching his body, Qin Shang picked up the *Spring Thunder* guqin and led Ye Yinzhu out of the bamboo house.\n\nYe Li's family had kept their promise. Ever since Yinzhu began learning the zither from Qin Shang, they only visited once a month—though, of course, the occasional secret peek was unavoidable.\n\nOutside the bamboo house was a large bamboo forest. Qin Shang stopped and asked, \"Yinzhu, what are the three timbres of the guqin, and what are their meanings?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu, clearly used to being tested by Qin Shang, answered without hesitation. \"The three timbres are open-string notes, stopped-string notes, and harmonics. Open-string notes are produced by the right hand plucking an open string, creating a full and mellow sound. Stopped-string notes are produced when the left hand presses a string against the zither's surface while the right hand plucks it, creating a gentle and rich sound. Harmonics are produced when the left hand lightly touches a string at the same moment the right hand plucks it, creating a clear and crystalline sound. The combination of these three timbres forms a zither melody.\"\n\nQin Shang nodded. \"Correct. The guqin is one of the most difficult of all instruments to play. The harmonics alone, with thirteen nodes on seven strings, produce ninety-one different notes. Combined with the open and stopped notes, the possible combinations are countless and marvelous. If you don't perfect your fundamentals, how can you achieve anything in the future?\"\n\nYinzhu nodded obediently. \"Grandpa Qin, I was wrong. I'll continue practicing the fundamentals.\"\n\nQin Shang smiled faintly. Though his words were critical, in his heart, he was extremely pleased with his disciple. Although Ye Yinzhu had only been formally studying the zither for a year, he had grown up immersed in its music from the time he was a month old until he was five. His familiarity with the zither's sound was probably not much less than Qin Shang's own. His natural talent for the instrument was unprecedentedly high; at such a young age, he had already grasped its essence. He was truly a genius among geniuses.\n\nQin Shang handed the *Spring Thunder* zither to Ye Yinzhu and had him sit at a bamboo table in the forest. \"How about this: if you can use the melody 'Green Water' to draw all the animals of this forest to your side and have them treat you as their dearest friend, I will teach you a new piece. Alright, you may begin your practice. I will go get you breakfast.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu nodded, placed the *Spring Thunder* zither on the bamboo table before him, and sat up straight. The moment his eight fingers touched the strings, his entire aura changed once more. Though the childish innocence remained on his face, it was now joined by a composure and grace that belied his age. His eight fingers plucked, and the melody of \"Green Water\" began to softly resonate.\n\nThe music was graceful and pleasant, but Qin Shang, standing to the side, frowned. \"Your heart must merge with your intent, and your intent must merge with the zither. If you cannot resonate with the music itself, your melody will never be able to stir the spirit of any living creature.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu looked up at Qin Shang for a moment. His hands did not stop, but he soon closed his eyes. A faint smile graced his beautiful little face. Though the melody was still \"Green Water,\" its essence had subtly changed. His entire being seemed to become immersed in a world of green mountains and clear waters. A faint red light emanated from his body, drifting outwards into the surroundings.\n\nSeeing this, Qin Shang finally nodded in satisfaction, sighing inwardly. *Ye Li, oh, Ye Li. You only know that our Zither Sect's Qin Magic is the most powerful of all magic, but how could you possibly know the immense difficulty of its cultivation? A Divine Sound Master's path is something you can't possibly imagine.*\n\n***\n\n¹ A nickname for the author.",

    "content": "The protagonist's childhood has passed, and we are officially entering the main story. Tonight at five and eight o'clock, there will be another chapter update for each time slot. Friends are welcome to add this to their collection. Please shower me with recommendation votes! Thank you.\n\n  ———————————————————————\n\n  Spirit-type magic is unlike any other kind of magic. First, one must strengthen their own spiritual power, then release it through special means to affect an opponent's mind in various ways. If elemental magic exists to destroy an opponent's body, then spiritual magic exists to destroy their soul.\n\n  To use zither music to temper one's spiritual power, and then to release that spiritual power through the zither music, using the different characteristics of each piece to generate different spiritual waves for attack or support—this is the secret of Zither Magic.\n\n  In the silent bamboo forest, a broad, deep, and yet lighthearted melody echoed continuously. Six-year-old Ye Yinzhu, aside from cultivating Dou Qi¹, spent his time learning the zither. His Innocent Zither Heart² allowed him to do anything without a single distracting thought. He played the zither piece \"Green Water\" over and over again. The passage of time seemed to have nothing to do with him, as his entire being was completely immersed in the profound mysteries of the music.\n\n  Influenced by the zither music, various small animals began to gather in the bamboo forest. Although they only dared to watch from a distance, they were clearly becoming enchanted by Ye Yinzhu's playing.\n\n  \"Huh, who are you?\" Qin Shang suddenly exclaimed as he returned to the front of the bamboo house, carrying a bamboo basket filled with food. The zither music stopped abruptly. Opening his eyes, Yinzhu curiously followed Qin Shang's gaze.\n\n  At some point, about five meters away from Ye Yinzhu, a little boy was squatting there, sitting dazedly and watching him play. This boy appeared to be about the same age as Yinzhu. He was nowhere near as handsome as Yinzhu, but the lines of his face gave off a feeling of steeliness—and he was only a child! Most surprisingly, he had a head of purple hair. It was a very unusual shade of purple, a hair color rarely seen among humans.\n\n  Hearing Qin Shang's voice, the little boy was startled awake. His previously dazed eyes revealed a strong sense of hostility. He waited for Qin Shang, his fists clenched and lips pursed, but did not say a word.\n\n  Yinzhu excitedly ran to Qin Shang's side, took the bamboo basket, and smiled. \"Grandpa Qin, look! My zither music attracted someone.\" As he spoke, he took out a freshly peeled bamboo shoot from the basket and offered it to the purple-haired boy. \"Hello, here, have some.\"\n\n  The purple-haired boy's gaze shifted from Qin Shang to Yinzhu's innocent, smiling face. His expression gradually changed, his clenched fists slowly relaxed, and he accepted the bamboo shoot from Yinzhu's hand, giving him a nod. Before Qin Shang could ask any more questions, he suddenly turned and ran, disappearing into the bamboo forest in the blink of an eye.\n\n  Watching the purple-haired boy's retreating back, Qin Shang couldn't help but frown. Could it be that the Bamboo Sect's Bewildering Maze Formation has failed? The little boy seemed very hostile towards him, yet he relaxed as soon as he looked at Yinzhu. Could it be that he was truly drawn here by Yinzhu's zither music? Being only a mage, he had no way of catching up to him, so he could only let the boy go.\n\n  Playing the zither during the day and cultivating Dou Qi to the sound of Qin Shang's music at night—this was Ye Yinzhu's simple life. However, since the appearance of the purple-haired boy, his simple life had gained a splash of color.\n\n  Every morning, when Yinzhu began to play his zither, the purple-haired boy would appear quietly and sit to the side, listening silently. With an audience member present, the process of practicing the zither no longer seemed so lonely.\n\n  Since his first appearance, the purple-haired boy had never said a single word to anyone. When only Yinzhu was present, his expression was calm, but as soon as Qin Shang, or Yinzhu's parents or grandfather came to visit, he would immediately leave.\n\n  Ye Zhong had once secretly followed the purple-haired boy, trying to see where he came from, but he only discovered that the boy also lived within the Azure Sky Sea, less than two thousand meters away from where Yinzhu practiced. He didn't seem any different from an ordinary child; the bamboo shoots in the forest were his food. The solitary and aloof purple-haired boy gradually gained everyone's acceptance. Since he wouldn't speak to Yinzhu anyway, he naturally wouldn't affect Yinzhu's cultivation of his Innocent Zither Heart. Thus, Qin Shang and Yinzhu's family came to accept his presence. When Yinzhu had free time, he would often talk to him, give him his clothes to wear, and share the food his parents brought. The purple-haired boy would just silently accept everything, still without uttering a word. However, the way he looked at Yinzhu grew softer and softer.\n\n  Spring passed and autumn came; in the blink of an eye, another ten years went by. The handsome child had grown into a handsome young man. Yinzhu's appearance was sixty percent similar to his father, Ye Zhong, but he had also inherited his mother's delicate beauty. At sixteen, he was already about 1.8 meters tall. With his well-proportioned figure, the white robes he always wore, and his long, flowing black hair, he was a handsome young fellow no matter how you looked at him.\n\n  \"Little Zi, Little Zi, where are you?\" Ye Yinzhu, dressed in a long white robe, called out loudly as he walked forward. His clear voice echoed through the bamboo forest, swirling gracefully like the notes of a zither.\n\n  Yinzhu called for a long time without a response. He couldn't help but stop and mutter to himself, \"Where did Little Zi go? Why can't I see him?\" His eyes lit up and a smile appeared on his face. \"I've got it.\" As he spoke, he sat down cross-legged on the ground. A silver light flashed on the middle finger of his left hand, and an ancient zither materialized before him. The body of the zither was full and rounded, hewn from paulownia wood. Its color was a warm yellow, the wood ancient and resonant, finished with a chestnut-colored lacquer and marked with snake-belly crackles. It had mother-of-pearl inlays for fret markers. The sound holes consisted of a round Dragon Pool and an oval Phoenix Pond. The soundboard above the Dragon Pool was slightly raised. The Wild Goose Feet and tuning pegs were made of red agate.\n\n  As he looked at the guqin, his gentle and clear eyes filled with a touch of adoration. \"The piece 'Three Refrains at Yang Pass' should be played on this balanced and serene Ninth Heaven Jade Pendant Zither. I don't believe you won't come out now.\"\n\n  His eight fingers gently caressed the strings, and instantly, a mournful and lingering melody drifted out. It was a song of parting, and from the first note, Yinzhu was completely immersed in its mood.\n\n  A dark red light slowly circled his body, forming rings of sound waves that spread outwards. There were no large animals in the Azure Sky Sea, but at this moment, all the birds and small creatures began to converge rapidly in Yinzhu's direction. For a time, the sorrowful cries of various animals rose and fell, and the area around Yinzhu gradually became lively.\n\n  \"Three Refrains at Yang Pass\" gets its name from a single melody being sung three times in succession. The piece is filled with the reluctance of parting with a friend. The music was brimming with feelings of unwillingness to let go. Scenes from his sixteen years of life in the Azure Sky Sea flashed through Yinzhu's mind, and a faint sadness appeared in his eyes, adding a touch of melancholy to his elegant demeanor.\n\n  The piece concluded in a soul-stirring finale. Yinzhu pressed his hands on the strings, silencing the last of the reverberations, and said with some sadness, \"I'm sorry, my friends, but I really have to go. I'll definitely come back to see you all, though. I don't want to leave either, but both my grandfathers said I have to go out and see the world. Consider this piece my farewell to you.\"\n\n  A tall figure had appeared behind Yinzhu at some point. Hearing his words, the expression on his face stiffened slightly, and he subconsciously raised his right hand and grabbed Yinzhu's shoulder.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Dou Qi (鬥氣):** A common term in Chinese fantasy genres, often translated as \"Battle Aura\" or \"Fighting Energy.\" It refers to a form of internal energy used for combat.\n2.  **Innocent Zither Heart (赤子琴心):** A state of pure, untainted focus, like that of a child, specifically for playing the zither.\n\n***\n\n*Original source text includes a promotional link for the publisher:*\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\"&gt;Qidian Chinese Network - We welcome all readers to come and read.

Thank you.\n\n——————————————————————\n\nYin Zhu seemed to have known he was behind him all along. He lowered his head and said, \"Xiao Zi, I have to go.\"\n\nWith a flicker, the tall figure was already in front of Yin Zhu. Among ordinary people, the sixteen-year-old Yin Zhu, at a height of 1.8 meters, was not short, but compared to the person before him, he was still shorter by a full head. His purple hair was somewhat messy, and his tall, powerful body seemed to be filled with explosive strength. His face, as if carved by a knife and chiseled by an axe, gave off a steely hardness, and his pair of deep purple eyes shone like brilliant stars. His broad shoulders looked as if they could bear any burden.\n\nYe Yin Zhu had grown up, and Xiao Zi had grown up as well. Ten years had passed, and the speed of his physical development had amazed Ye Yin Zhu's family. At over two meters tall, he looked much more mature than Ye Yin Zhu, completely lacking the light of pure innocence in Yin Zhu's eyes. Instead, he gave off a very profound feeling.\n\nGrabbing both of Yin Zhu’s shoulders, Xiao Zi's eyes were filled with confusion and questions.\n\nFeeling the heat from Xiao Zi’s hands, Yin Zhu looked up at him and said sadly, “I really have to go. This isn't zither practice; I came specifically to say goodbye to you. The two Grandpas said that my Pure Heart of the Zither has reached the ninth grade and is about to enter the realm of Sword's Gall, Zither's Heart, so I no longer need to be isolated from the outside world. They want me to go to school to learn about the outside world and adapt to society. So, I have to leave. Right now. Xiao Zi, what is the outside world like? I've never been out there before, but Grandpas said that to help me better experience everything, they won't be sending me off.”\n\nThe confusion in Xiao Zi's eyes gradually faded. He slowly nodded and released his hands from Yin Zhu’s shoulders. \"I'll go with you.\"\n\n\"Really? That's wonderful!\" Yin Zhu was overjoyed, jumping up like a child. However, he quickly realized something was wrong and looked at Xiao Zi strangely. \"You... you can talk?\"\n\nYes, this was the first time Xiao Zi had spoken in the ten years since he arrived at the Jade Sea. Before this, almost everyone had thought he was a mute. But now, he had spoken. His voice was deep and rich, giving off a very oppressive feeling, but to Yin Zhu's ears, it translated into a sense of security.\n\nXiao Zi patted Yin Zhu's shoulder. \"Let's go.\" As he spoke, he started walking toward the outside of the Jade Sea.\n\nYe Yin Zhu, who had been somewhat terrified at the prospect of a lonely journey, was now filled with excitement. For ten years, he had been with Xiao Zi almost every day. Although Xiao Zi had never spoken, just through the exchange of glances, just from Xiao Zi being his audience for ten years, he had come to regard him as one of his most trusted people and his best friend. With Xiao Zi accompanying him now, the unknown world outside no longer seemed so frightening.\n\nLetting out a cheer, Yin Zhu darted to Xiao Zi's side, and together they walked towards the outside world.\n\n\"Xiao Zi, what was your original name?\" Yin Zhu asked curiously as they walked. Aside from playing the zither and studying the teachings of the Bamboo Sect, he was a blank slate when it came to the outside world. A person's childhood is carefree, and the current Yin Zhu was just like that. He had not even left the Jade Sea, yet he had already more or less forgotten his parting from his family. With Xiao Zi by his side, the panic in his heart was gone, replaced by curiosity and excitement. After all, this was his first time leaving the Jade Sea.\n\n\"Just call me Zi.\"\n\n\"Oh. Zi, where are you from? I heard Grandpa say that you're not from our Jade Sea. Grandpa Qin said you have no ill intentions toward me, you just like my zither music, and that's why you stayed here. Is that right?\"\n\nZi's answer was simple; he just nodded.\n\nPerhaps because he was too excited, Yin Zhu was especially talkative today, asking questions nonstop along the way. But Zi rarely spoke, mostly just nodding or shaking his head. It wasn't until they entered Luna City that Yin Zhu finally quieted down a bit.\n\n\"Wow, is this a city? It looks so big and beautiful.\" Looking at Luna City's massive walls and the endless stream of people, Yin Zhu was indescribably excited, and he ran quickly toward the city gates.\n\n\"The Jade Sea is the most beautiful place,\" Zi said, gently shaking his head as he watched Yin Zhu run ahead.\n\nAlmost everything in Luna City was new to Yin Zhu. To cultivate the Pure Heart of the Zither, he had never stepped out of the Jade Sea in sixteen years. Now, under the sway of curiosity and excitement, he felt as if his two eyes weren't enough.\n\n\"Where are you going to school?\" Zi asked Yin Zhu, a rare question from him.\n\nYin Zhu replied subconsciously, \"Grandpa Qin told me to go to the Magicians' Guild in Luna City first to pick something up. He also gave me a map and said that if I follow its directions, I'll find the academy. I just have to give his letter to the dean there.\"\n\nZi held out his hand. \"The map.\"\n\nYin Zhu trusted Zi completely, a feeling that came from the bottom of his heart. Without hesitation, he took a specially made sheepskin map from his robes and handed it to Zi.\n\nZi unfolded the map and saw it was a complete map of the Longqinu si Continent. A red line started from Luna City and extended to a destination on the other side. At the destination was a line of small words that read: Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy.\n\nFrowning, Zi said, \"You're going to the Milan Empire. Your grandfathers are really letting you go with an easy mind.\"\n\nYin Zhu had no concept of geography and asked curiously, \"The Milan Empire? Is it very far?\"\n\nZi nodded. \"To get to Milan, you need to pass through the Pang Kingdom. Arcadia is at the southernmost tip of the continent, while Milan is in the north. Further north from there is the Far Northern Wasteland.\" As he said \"Far Northern Wasteland,\" his pupils contracted slightly, but they quickly returned to normal. Yin Zhu, however, noticed it.\n\n\"Zi, don't be afraid. Even if it's a little far, you have me. I'll protect you.\" As he spoke, Yin Zhu puffed out his chest childishly.\n\nZi was taken aback. \"You?\"\n\nYin Zhu nodded very seriously. \"That's right! I'll protect you. Grandpa Qin said I'm already a qualified magician.\"\n\nLooking at Yin Zhu, who was a full head shorter than him, a faint smile appeared on Zi's face, softening the hard lines of his features.\n\n\"Wow, Zi, you smiled! That's so rare. I don't think I've ever seen you smile before,\" Yin Zhu said, staring intently at Zi as if he had discovered a new continent.\n\nZi said with a sense of resignation, \"Alright, let's go to the Magicians' Guild first.\" Fortunately, the Magicians' Guild was a well-known place in Luna City. Zi asked a random person on the street and easily led Yin Zhu to the location.\n\nAlthough more than a decade had passed, the Magicians' Guild in Luna City was still as cold and deserted as ever, without even a guard at the door. Yin Zhu and Zi walked straight in, and soon they arrived outside the main hall. Before they even entered, they could hear arguing from within.\n\nThere were a total of nine people in the hall, divided into two factions. On one side stood Diara and, behind him, Pirlo and another fire-element magician. On the other side, six people, also magicians, wore robes of different colors. Judging by the colors of their robes, there was one Blue-rank Magister, two Green-rank Great Mages, and three Yellow-rank High Mages.\n\n***\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\">Qidian Chinese Network</a> welcomes all readers.

    "content": "Today's third chapter is updated. Although each chapter is a bit short, the total word count is over 7,000. San Shao¹ will do his best to write, so brothers, please don't rush me. I will definitely write this book well while ensuring its quality. The last two days were close to ten thousand words each. A nearly thirty-thousand-word update in three days isn't too little, is it? I’ll also have to trouble everyone to add this to your collections and vote.\n\n---\n\nDiara said angrily, \"Lufite, don't take it too far! Don't forget, you also came from here once.\"\n\nThe one called Lufite was the Blue-ranked Magister. He appeared to be in his fifties or sixties, short in stature but with an overbearing presence. The flame emblem on his chest indicated he was a fire-element Magister. With his hands clasped behind his back and a look of arrogance, he said disdainfully, \"That's right, I did come from here. And to this day, I'm still glad I made the decision to leave. Just look at this place yourself. Does this still look like the main branch of a nation's Magician's Guild? There are only three of you. After all these years, you still haven't broken through to the Cyan rank. I bet you haven't even reached the high-tier of the Cyan rank, have you? Diara, stop being so stubborn and come with us to Bopang. With how desperately the Bopang royal family seeks talented magicians, you will surely be put to good use.\"\n\n\"Praise Falan! Lufite, and you call yourself an Arcadian. Have you forgotten your roots?\" Diara's voice trembled slightly. Once upon a time, the Lufite before him had been Arcadia's most promising magician, but now he had come to Arcadia representing another country.\n\nLufite sneered, \"It seems your stubbornness hasn't changed. Doesn't your guild have a president who never shows his face? Tell him to come out. If he can defeat me, we'll leave immediately. Otherwise, don't blame me for not being polite.\"\n\nDiara was furious. \"Lufite, don't you forget, this is Arcadia, not your Bopang! What can you do, not being polite?\" As he spoke, he couldn't help but feel a sense of sorrow. Had Arcadia really fallen to the point where anyone could bully it?\n\nLufite said grimly, \"We are here this time to negotiate with the Arcadian royal family on behalf of Bopang. In my capacity as an envoy, even if I were to kill a few of you, I doubt the Arcadian royal family would dare to do anything. Or is it that your so-called president is just a spineless turtle? He doesn't dare to accept a challenge?\"\n\n\"Grandpa Qin is not a turtle. I'll accept your challenge on his behalf.\" Just as Diara was about to explode with rage, a clear and pleasant voice sounded from outside the door. The speaker was none other than Ye Yinzhu.\n\nThe sudden voice immediately drew the attention of all the magicians in the hall toward the entrance. The handsome Yinzhu and the tall, unyielding Zi had already walked in.\n\nZi merely stood beside Yinzhu. At this moment, he seemed to have reverted to how he was back in the Azure Sea, not saying a single word.\n\nYinzhu glared at Lufite. Since birth, the only people he had ever interacted with were his own family, Zi, and Qin Shang. Qin Shang's care and guidance for him were meticulous, and he had spent the most time with Qin Shang. In Yinzhu's heart, Qin Shang was already like family. Although he didn't quite understand what \"spineless turtle\" meant, he knew it wasn't a compliment.\n\nLufite looked at Yinzhu with some surprise. The handsome young man in white robes was a refreshing sight the moment he entered, especially his pair of clear black eyes, which easily left a deep impression.\n\n\"Did I hear you right? You want to challenge me?\"\n\nYinzhu nodded earnestly and said, \"Grandpa Qin is not here. I will accept your challenge on his behalf.\"\n\n\"Young man, you are?\" Diara asked Yinzhu.\n\nYinzhu glanced at Diara and gave a gentle smile but did not reply. Instead, he sat down directly on the floor. He didn't understand any formalities; his heart was now filled only with anger toward Lufite. His simple nature meant he wouldn't waste any time.\n\nUnder the somewhat surprised gazes of the crowd, the brownish-red Spring Thunder Zither floated out and settled upon his legs.\n\nThe Spring Thunder Zither was thirty-nine *cun*² long, seven *cun* wide at the shoulder, and four and a half *cun* wide at the tail. It had a brownish-red lacquer, with serpent-belly cracks and fine, flowing-water crackle patterns. Above the Dragon Pool on its back were carved the two characters for \"Spring Thunder.\" The thirteen inlaid markers beneath the strings were made of white jade. It was one of the five famous zithers of the Zither Sect, its tone pure and gentle. To a Divine Musician, a musical instrument was his magic staff.\n\n\"I'm starting.\" Yinzhu's left hand hovered over the zither's body, while his right hand lightly plucked a string, emitting a deep and resonant hum. A dark red light emanated, and Yinzhu's gaze focused on the strings. In an instant, the indignation in his expression completely vanished, replaced by an elegant, noble temperament with a sense of uprightness and peace. Unfortunately, when the six magicians on the other side saw the dark red light radiating from his body, they paid no attention to the change in his expression at all.\n\nWhat did dark red magic power represent? It was merely the lowest Red rank. Even a high-tier Red rank was just an ordinary magician, not even at the level of an intermediate magician. The six from Lufite's group were at least high-ranked magicians. What's more, this handsome young man before them seemed to be a Divine Musician. Seeing the light radiating from Yinzhu's body, they couldn't help but burst into laughter.\n\n\"Ah, it's you. Praise Falan.\" Diara's eyes widened in astonishment. He saw Yinzhu's eight fingers and instantly understood who this child was. However, before he could stop him, the zither's music had already begun.\n\nThe moment Yinzhu poured his spirit into the strings, he forgot everything in the outside world—or rather, ignored it. His heartstrings merged with the strings of the ancient zither. At this moment, his mind was filled only with the mysteries of finger and string, sound and intent, form and spirit, virtue and art that Qin Shang had once taught him. He murmured, \"The essence of sound responds to the profound subtleties of one's intent.\"\n\nIn that instant, the guild hall lit up. The light came from two places: one was the silver magic hexagram in the center of the hall, and the other was the seven strings on the Spring Thunder Zither upon Yinzhu's knees. A silver light blossomed in an instant. Yinzhu's voice seemed to contain boundless magic power. The looks of disdain froze in an instant as a string of low, winding, and endlessly lingering zither notes drifted out. Following the dark red light, it instantly scattered throughout the entire hall.\n\nThe melody was somewhat melancholic, but even more so, it was profound. It was the very same piece, \"Three Stanzas of Yang Pass,\" that Yinzhu had used to bid farewell to his beast friends in the bamboo forest. Played with a different state of mind and a different zither, the effect of the music was completely different. This time, the sorrow was lighter while the profundity was enhanced. In an instant, it filled the hearts of everyone present with a heavy feeling. Even the magic elements in the air were affected, becoming sluggish and stagnant.\n\nLufite frowned. He was surprised to find that the zither music was making him agitated, and it even seemed to be stirring his own emotions. Startled, he thought to himself, *It seems this young Divine Musician is not so simple.* Unfortunately, he didn't turn to look at his companions right then. If he had, he might have taken Yinzhu even more seriously. The two Green-ranked magicians were now staring blankly, their faces still frozen in the midst of their laughter, while the three Yellow-ranked magicians had dazed eyes, their bodies swaying slightly, unable to control themselves, having clearly lost control of their bodies.\n\nSpirit-element magicians had another name: Magician Killers. How easy could it be to chant a spell in front of a spirit-element magician?\n\nThe incantation from Lufite's mouth stopped abruptly after the very first syllable. He was horrified to discover that the moment he opened his mouth, his voice was interrupted by that strange zither music. Magic incantations required communicating with the magic elements in the air through a special intonation, using one's own magic power as a conduit to invoke the power of heaven and earth. But now, forget about communicating with the magic elements, he couldn't even complete a single line of the chant. Even Lufite, with his extremely powerful spiritual force, couldn't help but feel a flicker of panic.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **San Shao:** A self-referential nickname by the author, Tang Jia San Shao.\n2.  ***Cun:*** An ancient Chinese unit of length, roughly equivalent to an inch.",

Thank you.\n\n---\n\nYin Zhu completely ignored everything happening in the outside world. The piece *Three Stanzas of Yang Pass* was played three times, with each repetition more powerful than the last; the moment the three stanzas overlapped was the true peak of this zither piece. At this moment, the first stanza had already ended. Yin Zhu’s hands blurred across the zither strings like phantoms, and instantly, the tempo of the zither music quickened, and the stagnant, oppressive feeling in the air grew stronger and stronger. Besides the Blue-ranked magician Lu Fei Te, who could still maintain his clarity, the two low-ranked Green magicians and three Yellow-ranked magicians had completely lost their perception of the outside world, entranced by the zither music. Even Diara and the two magicians standing beside him were affected to varying degrees. The only one who was completely unaffected was, surprisingly, Zi, who stood behind Yin Zhu.\n\nIn truth, Yin Zhu, having reached the ninth rank of the Pure Heart of the Zither, already possessed strength equivalent to a high-ranked Yellow magician. It was only because the Pure Heart of the Zither was always red before a breakthrough that his opponents had mistaken his rank. After sixteen years immersed in the sea of the zither, how could his strength be simple? Let alone magicians of the same rank; once his zither music was unleashed, anyone within three ranks of him would be affected. What's more, his opponents had let their guard down, so even the Green-ranked magicians, who were higher-ranked than him, fell into his trap.\n\nThe dark red glow grew more and more intense. The magical elements in the air seemed to pulsate in rhythm with the zither music, and the low, sorrowful zither music now concealed a murderous intent. As a Zither Magician, the zither magic he cast was a direct area-of-effect attack. To challenge six opponents, none of whom were lower-ranked than himself, all alone—perhaps only Yin Zhu would dare to do such a thing.\n\nLu Fei Te felt the zither music's influence on him growing stronger and thought to himself, *This is bad*. However, he was, after all, a Blue-ranked magician, three ranks higher than Yin Zhu—around the seventh or eighth tier. Thus, he could still stabilize his mental energy. Biting the tip of his tongue, he used the pain to force himself into a clearer state of mind. Then, with a wave of his right hand, a magic staff appeared out of thin air in his grasp. With a flick of his wrist, a fireball the size of a bowl was already flying towards Yin Zhu.\n\nAny magician can instantly cast magic three ranks lower than their own; for example, a Green-ranked magician can instantly cast Red-ranked magic. *If I can't chant, I'll just finish you with an instant-cast spell.* Lu Fei Te's eyes were now filled with killing intent. Even now, he still hadn't given this \"Red-ranked\" Divine Music Master enough respect.\n\nThe bowl-sized fireball was orange. To be able to instantly cast an Orange-ranked spell in a panic, Lu Fei Te was indeed formidable. In the blink of an eye, the orange fireball was right in front of Yin Zhu.\n\nDiara, being Cyan-ranked, was also clear-headed and wanted to intervene, but with his strength, it was too late to cast an instant spell. He couldn't help but cry out in alarm.\n\nZi's fists quietly clenched. And just then, Yin Zhu suddenly looked up, a strange light glinting in his bright eyes. His eight fingers never stopped playing, but a faint yellow glow had, at some unknown point, suffused his hands. The zither's sound amplified in an instant. With a hum, a yellow-and-red wave of light, carrying a distant drone, drifted out, striking the orange fireball head-on.\n\nWith a soft *bang*, the orange fireball dissolved into specks of light and vanished.\n\nYin Zhu's left hand suddenly changed position, instantly hooking the seven strings and pulling them back an inch, while his right hand continued to play, forming a marvelous pressed note within *Three Stanzas of Yang Pass*. Then, his left hand released. Instantly, seven streams of mixed yellow-and-red light drifted out. There was no sound of tearing air, only the deep, resonant notes of the zither. The entire Spring Thunder zither emitted a pleasant sound like a soft clap of thunder.\n\nAs fast as the speed of sound, so too was the speed of that yellow-and-red light. The light flashed past, and at that same moment, *Three Stanzas of Yang Pass* came to an abrupt halt.\n\nThe six magicians from the Kingdom of Bopang all stood there, stunned, every one of them motionless, including Lu Fei Te.\n\nDiara and the two magicians behind him snapped back to their senses the moment the music stopped. But Zi, behind Yin Zhu, was just as stunned as the magicians from the Kingdom of Bopang, except his stunned gaze was fixed on Yin Zhu, because he was the only one who had seen where those seven yellow-and-red waves of light had gone.\n\nWith a flash of silver light, the Spring Thunder zither was returned to his spatial ring. Yin Zhu patted the dust off his clothes and stood up, muttering to himself in frustration, \"I still can't continue the piece while simultaneously firing seven Sound Blades. No wonder Grandpa Qin said my skill is still far from ready.\"\n\n\"They... what happened to them?\" Diara asked, somewhat unsettled.\n\n\"They're dead, I suppose.\" Yin Zhu stated the earth-shattering words calmly. \"Grandpa Qin said that any enemy who sees my Sound Blades must die. That man in the blue robes was very strong. I couldn't beat him otherwise, so I had to use the Sound Blades.\"\n\nHorrified, Diara looked toward Lu Fei Te and his five companions. On each of their necks, a line of blood had appeared, stretching across their entire throat. At the same time, the magic staff in Lu Fei Te's hand broke in two and fell to the ground. His eyes were wide open; even in death, he couldn't believe what had happened.\n\n...\n\n\"That's wrong. You must fuse your Dou Qi into the sound waves the instant the note is played to form a Sound Blade. You were too fast that time. Look, this is already the 160th zither string you've broken.\"\n\n\"Too slow this time. The Dou Qi didn't merge with the sound wave; it has no power at all.\"\n\n\"Grandpa Qin, when will I finally succeed?\"\n\n\"When? Only when you can seamlessly and effortlessly fire and control the Sound Blades while playing a piece will you have succeeded. You're still a long way off. Keep practicing. Remember, your fingers must strike from above the strings...\"\n\n...\n\nHaving killed six people, Yin Zhu's state of mind seemed completely unaffected. He didn't even spare another glance at Lu Fei Te's group of magicians, who were still standing there.\n\nIn reality, Lu Fei Te's strength was formidable. He had simply been too careless when he saw that Yin Zhu was only Red-ranked. He didn't even have time to release his magical pet or use his magic scrolls before he was instantly killed by Yin Zhu under the influence of the zither music.\n\n\"Which one of you is Grandpa Diara?\" Having killed six people, Yin Zhu's state of mind seemed completely unaffected. He didn't even spare another glance at Lu Fei Te and the magicians, who were still standing there.\n\nDiara's voice trembled slightly. Now, looking into Yin Zhu's clear, black eyes, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of fear. \"I... I am. Your Grandpa Qin asked me to give you this.\" As he spoke, he took out a badge representing a Red-ranked magician from his robes and handed it to Yin Zhu.\n\nYin Zhu excitedly took the badge. It was a red, six-pointed star-shaped badge, engraved with the image of an ancient zither. A faint magical fluctuation flowed across its surface.\n\n\"So this is what Grandpa Qin asked you to give me! I'll be going then. Thank you, Grandpa Diara.\" With that, Yin Zhu took Zi by the hand and started to walk away.\n\n\"Ah! Praise be to Falan, wait a moment,\" Diara hurriedly called out to stop him.\n\nYin Zhu turned his head and asked curiously, \"Is there something else?\"\n\nDiara mumbled, \"Your Grandpa Qin told me yesterday to give you a magician's badge, then to send someone to escort you to Milan and teach you some basic knowledge about the continent.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\">Qidian.com</a> We welcome all readers to come and read.

    "content": "There will be another chapter around 8 PM. I won't say more. If you readers think San's writing is decent, please bookmark and vote. Thank you. There is an explanation at the end of this chapter regarding Yin Zhu killing people.\n\n  ——————————————————————————\n\n  Zi, standing to the side, suddenly understood. Qin Shang still wasn't comfortable letting Yin Zhu travel alone. Before Yin Zhu could speak, he cut in, \"I don't think that will be necessary. It's enough to have me and Yin Zhu together. Let's go.\" This time, it was his turn to pull Yin Zhu, and they walked out of the Magic Guild without a backward glance.\n\n  Diyala wanted to stop them, but when he saw a cold glint flash in Zi's eyes, the words on the tip of his tongue were subconsciously retracted. He turned to look at the six standing corpses and said with a mournful expression, \"What should I do? What am I going to do? The emissaries of Bopang all died here...\"\n\n  Pirlot walked to Diyala's side and said in a low voice, \"Vice President, probably no one saw them come here, right? Even if someone did, we can just deny it! You should deal with this quickly and then report to the President and let him decide.\"\n\n  Diyala hesitated. \"You mean... destroy the bodies and erase all traces.\"\n\n  Pirlot glanced at the bodies of Lufite and the others with disgust and said hatefully, \"They should have died long ago. I just never imagined the President's disciple would be so powerful. He seems to be only at the Red rank! It's too hard to believe.\"\n\n  Having cultivated magic for many years, Diyala gradually calmed down. \"Alright, none of you are to speak of what happened today, especially about that boy. Forget everything you saw. Now, let's deal with them first. Do it cleanly.\"\n\n  A cold light flashed in Pirlot's eyes. \"Destroying bodies and erasing traces—that's what we Fire Mages do best.\"\n\n  Yin Zhu, naturally, had no idea how much trouble he had caused the Magic Guild. Walking on the streets of Luna City, he asked Zi beside him, \"Zi, I just killed people. Was what I did... right?\"\n\n  Zi looked at Yin Zhu with a gentle gaze and nodded very seriously. \"Of course, it was right. When facing an enemy, you must cut the weeds and pull up the roots. Otherwise, you'll only bring more trouble upon yourself. Annihilation is the best way to deal with an enemy. You did very well today.\"\n\n  Yin Zhu was like a blank slate. Hearing Zi's praise, the little doubt in his heart vanished instantly. He smiled. \"That's good, then. In the future, when I have enemies, I'll kill them. But, Zi, since Grandpa Qin said to have the Magic Guild find someone to teach me about the continent's common knowledge, is it really okay for us to just leave like that?\"\n\n  Zi stopped and said with a serious expression, \"Yin Zhu, do you trust me?\"\n\n  Yin Zhu nodded without hesitation. \"Of course I do. You're my best friend.\"\n\n  Zi smiled. \"In that case, let me teach you everything about the continent. Come on, let's go buy some things first, and then we should get going.\"\n\n  Looking at Zi's smile, Yin Zhu couldn't help but feel a warmth in his heart. Without another thought, he followed him. Qin Shang and Ye Li probably never would have imagined that Yin Zhu would end up heading to Milan with someone who taught him to kill, rather than following the arrangements they had made.\n\n  Zi led Yin Zhu to a shop on the side of the street and stopped. \"Yin Zhu, do you have any money on you?\"\n\n  Yin Zhu nodded. With a flash of silver light from his hand, a handful of gold coins appeared. \"Grandpa gave them to me. I think I have several hundred of these. You need them?\"\n\n  Zi nodded, took the gold coins from Yin Zhu's hand, and then led him into the shop.\n\n  Clanging sounds came continuously from the back of the shop. A middle-aged man sat inside, looking lethargic. He only stood up when Zi and Yin Zhu entered. \"What can I get for you?\"\n\n  Yin Zhu looked around curiously. On the walls hung various weapons and suits of armor, things he had never seen before. He couldn't help but ask Zi, \"Zi, what are these?\"\n\n  Zi replied, \"These are the armor worn and weapons used by warriors.\"\n\n  Yin Zhu said, \"Are we buying some? They look pretty good. Do you want one?\"\n\n  Zi nodded and said to the middle-aged man, \"Give me a two-handed greatsword.\"\n\n  The man said lazily, \"There are many kinds of two-handed greatswords. What kind do you want? You've come to the right place; the weapons produced here are famous throughout all of Arcadia.\"\n\n  Zi said with some impatience, \"Cut the crap. Any kind will do, as long as it's heavy. The heavier, the better.\"\n\n  Zi's blunt words angered the middle-aged man, but after one look at Zi's powerful build, he didn't dare say much. He thought to himself, *You want heavy? Fine, I'll give you heavy.*\n\n  \"Then follow me.\" As he spoke, the man turned and walked toward the back room.\n\n  Yin Zhu and Zi followed him inside, where several muscular men were forging weapons, sweat pouring down like rain. Arcadia was already hot enough, and it was even hotter next to the furnace. However, neither Yin Zhu nor Zi seemed to feel it much as they followed the constantly sweating middle-aged man to the very back.\n\n  The middle-aged man pointed to a corner. \"This is the heaviest two-handed greatsword. If you can lift it, I'll sell it to you.\" As he spoke, a mocking glint appeared on his face.\n\n  In the corner was a pitch-black object. Frankly, it could hardly be called a sword; it was more like an iron rod. It was nearly two meters long, thicker at one end and much thinner at the other. But even the thin end was as wide as an adult's arm, and the thick end was the size of a human head, covered in a thick layer of dust.\n\n  \"This is what you call a sword?\" Yin Zhu said angrily. Although this was his first time leaving the Azure Sea, he still knew very well what a sword looked like.\n\n  The middle-aged man said, \"This is a special sword. Didn't you want a heavy one? This is the heaviest one I have. If you can lift it, I'll just give it to you.\" As he spoke, the mockery in his eyes became even more obvious.\n\n  Zi's gaze was calm, but Yin Zhu could faintly sense that he was in a very bad mood. Taking a step forward, Zi grasped the thin end of the iron rod. The moment he exerted his strength, a soft \"huh\" escaped his lips, and even his eyes showed a hint of surprise. A slight smile appeared at the corner of his mouth as he lifted the two-meter-long iron rod. \"Not bad.\"\n\n  Watching Zi easily lift the iron rod, the middle-aged man's eyes nearly popped out of their sockets. No one knew better than him how terrifyingly heavy that rod was. He had come across it by chance while leading his men to mine iron ore. He knew its weight was dozens of times that of an equivalent volume of iron, at least over five hundred kilograms. If not for his greed in thinking it might be some special metal, he would never have even brought it back. But he was later disappointed; no matter how strong the fire, even after paying a high price to hire a Fire Mage, he couldn't melt or reforge the iron rod. After a while, it was just left in this forge. He simply couldn't believe that someone could lift this rod so easily without using Dou Qi, and that this person looked so young.\n\n  \"Let's go.\" Zi said these two simple words and started to walk out with Yin Zhu.\n\n  \"W-wait a minute,\" the middle-aged man's voice came from behind.\n\n  Zi frowned. \"Are you thinking of going back on your word?\"\n\n  ———————————————————————————\n\n  Regarding the protagonist killing, let me (San) explain here. First, Ye Yin Zhu has not received much education about the outside world since childhood. In other words, he doesn't really understand the meaning of killing. In his simple heart, people are only classified as good or bad. At the same time, he used Sound Blades to kill them, which was instantaneous. The dead mages just looked like they had stopped moving; there was no cruel or gruesome scene. Therefore, he doesn't see it as something terrifying. From another perspective, Ye Yin Zhu was facing Blue-ranked mages whose true magical strength was far above his own. Under immense pressure, he could only choose to use his strongest technique to attack the enemy, and it was only due to the unique nature of his magic that he succeeded in one fell swoop. Frankly, he should be happy about defeating an opponent stronger than himself. His calm, child-like heart is what keeps his state of mind peaceful. As an outstanding Divine Music Master, maintaining one's inner state is the most important thing, no matter the circumstances.\n\n  When writing this part, I (San) also considered this issue carefully. Although the protagonist is a simple youth when he leaves the Azure Sea, I don't want to write him as cowardly. Cultivating the Bamboo Sect's Dou Qi requires having a proud spine like bamboo, and being merciless toward enemies is a tenet of the Bamboo Sect. Please continue reading. It will get more and more exciting.\n\n  It's just killing a few people; this is a fantasy novel, after all. Later on, there may be large-scale war scenes. Is Ye Yin Zhu supposed to be grief-stricken to death after killing a thousand people at once with his zither music?\n\n  Moreover, there's Zi. Zi's influence on Ye Yin Zhu is quite significant. You will see how Zi tells Yin Zhu whether killing is right or wrong. The more simple-minded a person is, the more easily they act without regard for the consequences.\n\n  At the same time, I (San) also want to say that the one who bears the consequences for the protagonist's killing is not himself. Consider this a small spoiler. As the saying goes, \"the monk can run, but the temple can't.\"¹ The unfortunate ones will be the Arcadia Magic Guild, or rather, the Kingdom of Arcadia. Simply put, this is also a small bit of foreshadowing.\n\n  My dear readers wouldn't want to force me (San) to reveal all my foreshadowing, would you? Hehe. Please just keep reading. I absolutely guarantee that it will get more and more exciting. Also, as an aside, I don't have much of a stockpile of chapters for this book; I'm constantly writing hard. To write better, I have slowed down my writing speed, but not my update frequency. This requires me to invest even more time into writing. I hope you all can be understanding and please don't rush me.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ A Chinese idiom (跑得了和尚跑不了廟) meaning that even if a person escapes, they cannot escape the consequences, which will fall upon their home, organization, or something they cannot take with them.",

    "content": "Today's third chapter update is here. To all the readers who enjoy this book, please add it to your collection and vote.\n\n———————————————————————————\n\nThe middle-aged man, somewhat panicked, quickly waved his hands and said, \"No, no, I just wanted to ask if you still need any armor? The price is negotiable.\" He wasn't a fool; on the contrary, as a merchant, he was very shrewd. From the fact that Zi could easily lift such a heavy iron staff, he could already tell that Zi and Yin Zhu were definitely not ordinary people. For a weapons merchant like him, encountering powerful warriors was clearly the happiest of occasions. His lazy expression vanished, and he only wanted to sell some more armor.\n\nZi said coldly, \"I don't need armor.\" After speaking, he walked out with Yin Zhu.\n\nUnder Zi's lead, the two purchased some more daily necessities in Luna City before finally leaving the capital of Arcadia and heading north along the main road.\n\n...\n\nJade Air Sea.\n\n\"Dad, I'm a little worried about Yin Zhu. The child has never left home before. Shouldn't we follow him secretly? At least until we see him to the academy,\" Mei Ying said uneasily.\n\nYe Li smiled slightly and said proudly, \"A descendant of my Ye family possesses a naturally strong ability to adapt. Besides, with your Uncle Qin's letter and people from the Magicians' Guild accompanying him, nothing will happen.\"\n\nMei Ying was still worried. \"I'm afraid that child Yin Zhu doesn't know how to get along with people. What if he suffers at the academy?\"\n\nQin Shang, who was at the side, smiled. \"Aren't you all clear about Yin Zhu's strength? Besides, the head of the Divine Music department at the Milan Magic and Martial Academy is a good friend of mine. With my letter of recommendation, Yin Zhu will be fine. He has cultivated the *Chizi Qinxin*¹ for fifteen years; it's time for him to go out and make his own way in the world. Only by doing so can he grow up faster. I just wonder what my old friend's reaction will be when he sees that I've introduced such a young teacher to him? Hahahaha.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Zi, you're amazing!\" Yin Zhu said to Zi as they walked along the main road, curiously looking at the surrounding scenery.\n\nThe heavy, dark iron staff hoisted on his shoulder, Zi said, \"How am I amazing?\"\n\nYin Zhu said, \"You bought so many things, it seems like you're very familiar with the outside world. But, I remember you came to the Jade Air Sea when you were very young and don't seem to have ever left.\"\n\nA cold glint flashed in Zi's eyes as he said faintly, \"That was in the past, Yin Zhu. I'll tell you in the future.\"\n\n\"When is 'in the future'?\"\n\n\"When you've truly grown up, I suppose.\"\n\nThe Kingdom of Arcadia was pitifully small, not even a third of the size of the Bopang Kingdom. Luna City was also relatively close to the northern part of the kingdom, so after walking for ten days, the two had already entered the territory of the Bopang Kingdom.\n\nUpon entering Bopang, the air became much cooler. The Bopang Kingdom felt completely different compared to Arcadia. The official road was twice as wide, and there were numerous pedestrians on it, most of whom were riding Horned Horses.\n\nThe Horned Horse, a Tier 1 magical beast, was named for the two forked horns on its head. It had a sturdy body. Although they were the lowest-ranked magical beasts and possessed no attack power, their endurance was excellent, making them the best tool for civilian transport. In Arcadia, only some of the wealthy could afford to own a Horned Horse.\n\n\"Zi, let's buy a Horned Horse to ride too. How much does a Horned Horse cost?\" Yin Zhu watched the pedestrians riding their Horned Horses, an envious look on his face. He still had the disposition of a child, after all, and couldn't easily contain his excitement upon seeing something new.\n\nZi thought for a moment and said, \"Alright, that way we can travel faster. If we just walk, I'm afraid we won't even reach Milan in two months. About thirty *li* ahead is Bopang's southernmost city, Rolle. We'll buy one there.\"\n\n\"One?\"\n\n\"Mm, one is enough. I don't need one. A Horned Horse's speed isn't necessarily faster than me running.\" Zi looked at Yin Zhu with a smile. His smile only ever appeared in front of Yin Zhu; when there were outsiders, he always wore a cold, icy expression.\n\n\"I don't believe you. Let's have a race,\" Yin Zhu said with a laugh.\n\nZi glanced at him. \"Then let's start.\" As he spoke, his body had already shot forward. His tall frame and the heavy iron staff didn't affect his speed in the slightest.\n\n\"Ah, you're cheating!\" Seeing that Zi had already started running, Ye Yin Zhu hastily floated up, tapped the ground with one foot, and quickly chased after Zi.\n\nZi's running movements were heavy and steady, each step landing with his full foot, powerfully pushing his body forward. Yin Zhu's movements, however, were extremely light. He merely tapped the ground with his toes, covering a distance of over five meters with each tap. His speed was extremely fast, and in just a few leaps, he had already caught up to Zi's side.\n\n\"Zi, I'm faster than you,\" Yin Zhu said, a little smugly.\n\nZi gave him a strange look. \"Is that so?\" When he took his next step, Yin Zhu suddenly felt the entire ground tremble violently. A roar erupted from under Zi's foot, and in the next moment, his body shot out like an arrow. This time, he covered a distance of nearly twenty meters in a single bound. Another roar followed, and Yin Zhu was left behind.\n\nThere was no aura of Dou Qi.² Yin Zhu was startled. Though his heart was like a blank sheet of paper, he was very intelligent. To be able to generate such speed relying solely on physical strength was something he knew he definitely couldn't do. *Zi, just how many secrets do you have?* As he thought this, he hastily quickened his pace to chase after him.\n\nJust then, the deafening sound of horse hooves suddenly came from ahead, right in Yin Zhu and Zi's path. In the distance, a large cloud of dust rose up, approaching them rapidly like an earthen dragon. There were still some pedestrians on the road, who were now scrambling to the sides in a panic. Wherever the \"earthen dragon\" passed, a wave of startled cries followed.\n\nIt was a troop of about a hundred cavalrymen. They wore black full-body heavy armor, held four-meter-long knight's lances horizontally in their hands, and had heavy iron shields hanging from their saddles. Their unstoppable, steely presence was enough to make anyone shrink back. What they rode were not Horned Horses, but Tier 3 magical beasts—the Iron-armored Beast. They resembled Horned Horses but had no horns, and their heads and bodies were covered in a layer of keratinous armor. Their charging power was extremely strong, making them the best mounts for ordinary cavalry on the Longqinus continent. Heavy cavalry was an absolute mainstay combat unit in any country on Longqinus, but they were expensive to create. The entire heavy cavalry of Arcadia only amounted to a single corps of ten thousand men.\n\nOnce the Iron-armored Beasts started charging, coupled with the weight of the heavy cavalrymen themselves, the force was absolutely terrifying. These cavalrymen completely ignored the pedestrians on the official road.\n\nZi and Yin Zhu stopped walking at almost the same time. Watching the approaching Iron-armored heavy cavalry, neither of them moved to the side of the road. Yin Zhu didn't move out of curiosity for the Iron-armored Beasts and the heavy cavalry, while in Zi's dictionary, the words \"give way\" simply did not exist.\n\n\"Get out of the way!\" the leading heavy cavalryman roared, seeing two people on the road who were actually not moving aside.\n\nZi didn't move, but his gaze turned icy and calm. Yin Zhu didn't move either, because Zi hadn't moved. He had said he would protect Zi, and he subconsciously took a step forward, shielding Zi with his body. He didn't even ask Zi why he wasn't dodging.\n\nA savage glint appeared in the heavy cavalryman's eyes. *Since you won't dodge, then you can die.* In the Bopang Kingdom, the heavy cavalry was a privileged military unit. In the process of carrying out orders, they were permitted to kill any interfering civilians without mercy. Therefore, they felt no psychological burden whatsoever.\n\nCloser, they were getting closer. The Iron-armored heavy cavalry was now right in front of the two. The front row of five cavalrymen raised their lances horizontally in unison. They had no doubt that their thick, heavy lances would easily pierce through the bodies of the two commoners before them.\n\n\"ROAR—\" A ferocious roar thundered like a clap of thunder from the heavens. Yin Zhu only felt his entire body lighten as if he had started to fly, the scenery below him gradually shrinking. Soon, he witnessed a bizarre scene.\n\n---\n¹赤子琴心 (chì zǐ qín xīn): Lit. \"Heart of a Pure Child Zither,\" a state of mind representing ultimate purity and innocence, especially in the context of music.\n\n²鬥氣 (dòu qì): A common term in Chinese fantasy novels for a type of cultivated energy used in combat, often translated as \"Battle Aura\" or \"Fighting Qi.\"",

Brothers with monthly passes, please cast your votes for Sheng Xiao first, thank you.\n\n—————————————————————————-\n\nZi roared at the sky, and the iron-armored heavy cavalry that had already charged close underwent an almost instantaneous change. All the iron-armored beasts were forcefully reared up at the same time, their forward momentum coming to an abrupt halt. Because they had been charging too fast, the beasts behind crashed into the ones in front. The sound of the heavy cavalrymen's armor colliding rose and fell, and there were even sounds of lances piercing flesh, accompanied by screams. The hundred-man company of imposing iron-armored heavy cavalry descended into chaos in an instant.\n\nYe Yinzhu was convinced that he would never be able to forget the sight of Zi roaring—that violent emotion, that bloodthirsty aura, that icy gaze were all deeply branded into the depths of his mind.\n\nThe heavy cavalrymen were shocked, not knowing what had happened. They only felt that amid the deafening roar, their hearts were about to leap out of their throats. And at this moment, the iron-armored beasts that had once accompanied them onto the battlefield were trembling beneath them; some were even foaming at the mouth and nose.\n\n\"Get out of the way,\" Zi growled and strode forward. At that moment, Yinzhu happened to land just behind him.\n\nZi’s speed was not fast, but every step forward gave one the feeling of a solid rock. The iron-armored beasts of the foremost heavy cavalrymen had already collapsed limply to the ground. Seeing the purple-haired young man approaching, they subconsciously thrust their lances towards Zi.\n\nZi moved. His action was swift and simple. The two-meter-long black iron staff swept out horizontally. Five lances and their owners were sent flying in an instant, landing more than ten meters away by the roadside. Their lances, forged from refined steel, were now bent like snakes.\n\nZi had already walked up to the iron-armored beasts that had lost their masters. With the same simple motion, his right foot swept out, and an iron-armored beast weighing over two hundred kilograms was sent flying sideways, crashing heavily to the ground with a piteous cry. With the same motion, all five iron-armored beasts were flung aside, clearing a wide path for Zi to advance.\n\nAside from those who had been accidentally injured earlier, the heavy cavalrymen had all scrambled up from their beasts. They couldn't sense the presence of Dou Qi from Zi, but his overbearing power made their hearts freeze with terror. Five iron-armored cavalrymen sent flying with a single blow, their once-ferocious iron-armored beasts kicked away like straw, not even daring to resist in the slightest—what kind of terrifying power was this!\n\n\"Get lost,\" Zi growled again. This time, the heavy cavalrymen didn't even dare to attack. In the face of absolute, terrifying power, they silently parted, clearing a path, even using all their strength to drag their collapsed beasts to the side.\n\nZi strode forward with his head held high, seemingly oblivious to the lances gleaming in the sunlight on both sides. Yinzhu looked curiously at Zi in front of him and followed him forward. This was the first time he had seen Zi use force; he had never imagined Zi's power was so immense, and that it was pure physical strength.\n\nNo one dared to block them, and even the passersby who saw this scene didn't dare to breathe loudly. It wasn't until Zi and Yinzhu's figures disappeared at the end of the road that the iron-armored beasts gradually recovered their ability to move.\n\nThe five heavy cavalrymen who had been sent flying by the staff all had their right arms completely shattered. Their mounts, those five iron-armored beasts, could no longer get up. Fragments of their internal organs continuously sprayed from their mouths.\n\n\"Zi, are you a warrior?\" Yinzhu asked.\n\n\"I guess so.\" The frenzy in Zi's eyes had completely vanished, returning to calm.\n\n\"Zi, why did you act just now?\"\n\nZi glanced at the azure sky and said nonchalantly, \"Because no magical beast can make me step aside. Not even a dragon.\"\n\nYinzhu gave Zi a deep look. \"Zi, you know? You felt very powerful just now. But I couldn't sense the reason for your power. Do you know Dou Qi?\"\n\n\"No. Because I don't need it.\" Zi glanced at Yinzhu and suddenly revealed a slight smile. \"Aren't you going to protect me?\"\n\nYinzhu smiled too. \"Of course. As long as you need me, I will always stand in front of you to protect you. Just don't throw me so high next time.\"\n\nRour was a bustling little city. At least, the people living here all seemed busy, not lazy like in Arcadia. The cool air brought waves of comfort, and the pleasant temperature was ideal for living.\n\nYe Yinzhu's handsome looks and Zi's ruggedness often attracted attention on the streets, especially from young girls. Some of the bolder ones would even throw flirtatious glances at them. Zi, naturally, maintained his icy demeanor, but Yinzhu would often respond with a smile. Handsome and gentle, he was more likely to catch the eye of those lovesick young girls. However, if these girls knew what Yinzhu was thinking, they probably wouldn't feel the same way.\n\n\"Zi, why do those girls look different from us? Their chest muscles are so strong!\" Yinzhu said with some envy.\n\nThe expression on Zi's face stiffened for an instant. He said in a low voice, \"Didn't your parents ever tell you?\"\n\nYinzhu shook his head. \"You were with me at the Cerulean Sea for so long, you saw it. I spent very little time with my father and mother, and to not affect my cultivation of the Pure Heart of the Zither, they never told me about the outside world. Do you know why girls' chest muscles are stronger than ours?\"\n\nZi looked at Yinzhu helplessly. \"I don't.\"\n\n\"So you don't know either. It's a shame I don't have any girls as friends, otherwise I could ask them. Zi, let's go buy some horn-horses. Should we stay here today or continue on our journey?\"\n\nAs Yinzhu was asking, Zi's expression changed drastically. Being very close to him, Yinzhu clearly felt all the muscles in Zi's body tense up in an instant. A very strange aura began to spread from him. Yinzhu couldn't describe what kind of feeling it was; it seemed like anger, yet also like excitement.\n\nFollowing Zi's gaze, he saw a group of more than ten people walking in another direction not far away. The one Zi was staring at was a person whose head was completely covered in golden fur. He had a grim appearance and was a bit taller than Zi. His whole body emanated a wild aura, and the bulging muscles under his clothes were clearly filled with explosive power. His cheekbones were high, and the hair on his face was very thick, making him look very different from an ordinary human. The others with him also had various appearances, most of them unlike ordinary people; Yinzhu even saw one of them had a long tail growing from his back. When the pedestrians on the street saw these people, they all subconsciously gave them a wide berth, as if they were very afraid of them.\n\n\"Zi, what's wrong? Who are they?\" Yinzhu asked.\n\n\"They are Beastmen from the Far North Wasteland. The one in the lead is from one of the royal clans of the Beastmen, the Lion Clan,\" Zi said grimly.\n\n\"Beastmen? What are Beastmen? Are they people too?\"\n\nwww.cmfu.com Qidian Chinese Network welcomes all readers to come and enjoy the latest, fastest, and hottest serialized works, all at Qidian Original",

    "content": "Tonight, Xiao San has something on—I'm going home to have dinner with my parents—so I'm releasing both of tonight's chapters at once for everyone to enjoy.\n\n——————————————————————————-\n\n\"I don't know how the Beastmen came to be, either. You could say they are a combination of man and beast; some are even purely bestial. On the Longqinusi continent, the Beastmen are the race most closely related to magical beasts. They are naturally warlike and possess extremely formidable strength. If it weren't for their lack of proficiency in magic, which has allowed the three great human empires of the north to keep them suppressed, they probably would have invaded the human heartlands long ago. As it is, they can only live in the bitterly cold lands of the Far Northern Wasteland. Because of the strength of the three human empires bordering the Far Northern Wasteland, there haven't been any wars for several decades. The Beastmen can only trade some of the Wasteland's local specialties to the human nations in exchange for food and daily necessities. I never expected they would come as far south as Bopang.\" At this, Zi wore a pensive expression.\n\nTo Yin Zhu, the Beastmen were undoubtedly a novelty. He had never seen such a race before and couldn't help but steal a few more curious glances. Just then, the Lionman's gaze happened to sweep over, passing over Yin Zhu before landing on Zi. The instant he saw Zi, the golden fur on his head bristled, a ferocious light flared in his eyes, and he strode toward Zi and Yin Zhu. A faint layer of green Dou Qi flowed amidst the golden fur on his body, though its glow was so faint that one wouldn't notice without looking closely. Only a magic user like Yin Zhu, who cultivates spiritual power, could sense it easily.\n\nZi abruptly raised his head, his eyes meeting the Lionman's. The Lionman's steps faltered for a moment. Looking into Zi's icy eyes, he slowly nodded his head, then immediately turned and returned to his group.\n\nYin Zhu didn't know what had happened. He just looked at Zi, then back at the Lionman. Zi sighed and said to Yin Zhu in a low voice, \"I'm sorry, Yin Zhu. I'm afraid I can't accompany you to Milan anymore.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Yin Zhu was shocked. \"Zi, why? Didn't you say...\"\n\nZi raised a hand and grasped Yin Zhu's shoulder, a bitter smile on his face. \"I'm sorry, I did promise to go with you. But something has come up that I must deal with. You take the map. Follow the directions on it, and you'll reach the Milan Magic and Martial Academy. If you get lost, just ask someone for directions. Once I've handled my business, I'll come to the academy to find you.\"\n\nYin Zhu took the map Zi handed him. In that instant, his heart was filled with a sense of loss. For ten years, he had never been separated from Zi. Now that Zi was suddenly leaving, and with such a resolute look in his eyes, Yin Zhu felt an indescribable sadness. It was as if his heart had become hollow, as if he had lost something of the utmost importance.\n\n\"Zi, you seem to have a lot of secrets you don't want to tell me. If you need my help, will you tell me? I'm your brother!\" Yin Zhu said with some urgency.\n\n\"Brother.\" Two scorching flames ignited in Zi's deep eyes as he clapped Yin Zhu firmly on the shoulder. \"That's right, we're good brothers. Yin Zhu, you go on to the Magic and Martial Academy first. I won't be delayed for too long; I will definitely find you there. That's my promise to you. Remember, don't trust people easily on the road. At the same time, do your best to conceal your strength. Never let an outsider know the true extent of your power. Only then can you best protect yourself. Do you understand? This is for you. When you need to do something you don't want others to know about, wear it. Also, we had that conflict with Bopang's heavy cavalry on the road earlier. To avoid trouble, you should leave here as soon as possible.\" As he spoke, Zi took something from his tunic and pressed it into Yin Zhu's hand, then headed off in the direction the Lionman had disappeared without a backward glance.\n\nYin Zhu didn't pull his gaze away until Zi's figure had completely vanished. Although the streets of Rolle City were bustling, he felt a sense of desolation in his heart, even a trace of loneliness and helplessness. Now, he was all alone.\n\nLooking down at the last thing Zi had given him, he saw it was a mask made of some unknown material, very soft and comfortable to the touch. Carefully tucking it into his tunic, Yin Zhu thought to himself, *Zi, you have to come find me soon!* Now, he could only rely on himself. First, he would buy a horned horse, then get to the Milan Magic and Martial Academy as quickly as possible to wait for Zi.\n\nAt this thought, Yin Zhu's sense of loss gradually faded. He asked someone on the street for directions and learned that horned horses were sold at the slave market near the north gate. He set off in that direction, full of purpose. Zi had once told him that on this continent, gold coins were the universal currency in all nations. One gold coin was equivalent to one hundred silver coins. Generally, people mainly used silver coins; a family's monthly expenses were only a dozen or so silver coins. Buying a horned horse would cost a few gold coins at most.\n\nOn the Longqinusi Continent, almost every human city had a slave market; it was an indispensable part of society. The class system was extremely strict, and the slave market was where the lowest class of humans, slaves, were sold. With the development of the continent, the scope of the slave markets had expanded to include the sale of slaves from various races and even magical beasts. Of course, the magical beasts sold were generally of a very low level, not exceeding the third tier.\n\nOn the Longqinusi Continent, magical beasts were divided into ten tiers. Tier three and below were considered low-level magical beasts, tiers four to six were high-level magical beasts, and those above tier six were called Intelligent Magical Beasts. Low-level magical beasts were generally docile, and even the hot-tempered ones didn't have much destructive power. But high-level magical beasts were terrifying. As for the tier seven to ten Intelligent Magical Beasts, they were extremely fearsome existences. Tier ten magical beasts were also known as Divine Beasts, though they were merely the stuff of legends.\n\nAmong magical beasts, the two most powerful known races were the Behemoth Clan of the Far Northern Wasteland and the Dragon Clan living in Dragon City, a hidden land within the eight human nations. The numbers of true Dragons and true Behemoths were extremely small; looking back at the continent's history, their populations had never even reached four digits. However, their strength was exceptionally great. Even the weakest true Dragon or Behemoth was at least tier seven or higher. But the Dragon Clan possessed an advantage the Behemoths did not: they had many close relatives, which was largely related to the innately licentious nature of dragons. After thousands of years of procreation, although the number of true Dragons remains just as scarce, the number of various Lesser Dragons is now very large. Some of these have been successfully domesticated by humans, becoming various kinds of Tamed Dragons. While they cannot compare to true Dragons, possessing dragon bloodline ensures that even the weakest Tamed Dragon has at least tier-three strength, and the strongest can even rival a true Dragon. It is precisely because of the existence of these Tamed Dragons that the human nations possess extremely formidable power, which in turn has suppressed the Beastmen of the Far Northern Wasteland, preventing them from charging out of that bitterly cold land. Of course, humans would not invade a world where they themselves could not survive.\n\n\"I'm so pitiful! My mother died when I was three, and my father abandoned me when I was ten! Masters, madams, please have pity on me! Spare a few gold coins so I can have a bite to eat!\"\n\nYin Zhu had finally managed to find the entrance to the slave market. Just as he arrived, he saw a little beggar, sitting at the entrance and wailing loudly. The little beggar was small and thin, dressed in tatters from head to toe. His face was completely obscured by disheveled hair and grayish-black grime. His clothes were nothing but holes and torn strips of fabric. An old, broken bowl was placed in front of him as he cried and pleaded with the passersby.",

    "content": "Here is the third chapter for today. To my dear readers, please add this book to your collections and vote to support Xiao San. Thank you.\n\n  ————————————————————————\n\n  Generally, only two kinds of people entered the slave market through the main gate: those who came to sell, and those who came to buy. The sellers were naturally merchants or people from families so impoverished they had no choice but to sell themselves or their children. The buyers, on the other hand, were all high officials and nobles. But regardless of which kind they were, it was difficult for any of them to feel a sense of charity. Merchants valued profit and wouldn't spare a glance for a beggar; the poor couldn't even feed themselves, let alone others; as for the nobles, they were more concerned about a beggar dirtying their magnificent clothes. Therefore, for this little beggar to choose this place to beg was clearly not very wise. If he were a bit more robust, he might have been sold off as a slave, but he was far too small and thin. Combined with his filthy body, in the eyes of the slave traders, he wasn't even worth as much as bathwater.\n\n  Seeing a beggar for the first time, the pure-hearted Yin Zhu thought to himself, *He looks to be about my age, but he's so thin and small. He lost his mother at three and was abandoned by his father at ten—what a pitiful fate!* A feeling of pity welled up within him, and he subconsciously walked over and stopped in front of the beggar.\n\n  When the little beggar saw someone stop before him, his eyes instantly lit up. \"Master, master, I beg you, spare some money.\"\n\n  \"Here.\" Yin Zhu pulled out all the gold coins he had on him for buying a Horned Horse—about thirty or so—and, cupping them in both hands, placed them into the little beggar's outstretched hands.\n\n  The little beggar froze. He saw Yin Zhu's black eyes, which were as clear as crystal, without a trace of impurity. For some unknown reason, a chord deep within his heart trembled violently, but this feeling was quickly replaced by the joy of receiving the gold coins.\n\n  \"Thank you, thank you, master.\" With trembling hands, he almost frantically stuffed the gold coins into his clothes, his movements so fast that even Yin Zhu was startled.\n\n  \"Get up, the ground is cold.\" As he spoke, Yin Zhu paid no mind to the dirt on the other's hands and took hold of them. He felt that they were very soft hands; though small, the fingers were extremely long and slender.\n\n  The little beggar's head was bowed. In the sunlight, he happened to see the shimmering spatial ring on Yin Zhu's hand. His slender and nimble hands trembled slightly. Only then, with Yin Zhu's pull, did he stand up and say gratefully, \"Master, thank you. You're truly a good person.\" Because he stood up too quickly, his body brushed against Yin Zhu's. As Yin Zhu firmly gripped his hand to steady him, his slender and long fingers brushed lightly, making a secretive movement.\n\n  Yin Zhu smiled, a gentle and kind smile like that of an angel. He felt very comfortable inside, thinking to himself, *So this is how good it feels to help someone.* \"Goodbye.\" He waved at the little beggar and then walked into the slave market.\n\n  Watching Yin Zhu's disappearing back, a hint of struggle flashed in the little beggar's eyes. Gritting his teeth, he quickly darted off in another direction, vanishing into the crowd in the blink of an eye.\n\n  The slave market was divided into seven zones. The outermost was for selling low-level commoner slaves, where even a robust human slave was worth no more than fifty gold coins. The next zone was for selling some low-level magical beasts. The five zones after that, the deeper one went, sold things that became progressively more expensive. Of course, in a small city like Roer, there wouldn't be too many precious goods for sale. Only the slave markets in large cities had the truly good stuff, such as tamed dragons and beautiful elven women.\n\n  The moment Ye Yin Zhu entered the slave market, his first sensation was the noise. All sorts of sounds rose and fell, ringing in his ears. The place was huge, and for a moment, being completely inexperienced, he had no idea where to go to buy a Horned Horse. He hurriedly walked up to a middle-aged man who was passing by and asked, \"Hello, uncle. Excuse me, where can I buy a Horned Horse?\"\n\n  The middle-aged man appeared to be in his forties. He wore a set of exquisite black leather armor, with a crest of a crossed sword and shield entwined with thorns on his left chest. His towering stature rivaled Zi's, and on his back, he carried a one-and-a-half-meter-long two-handed greatsword.\n\n  \"You want to buy a Horned Horse? I happen to be going there myself. I'll take you,\" the middle-aged man said heartily.\n\n  \"That's great! Thank you, uncle.\" Yin Zhu thanked the man politely. The elegant temperament that had been subtly nurtured by years of zither music arose naturally, and combined with his handsome features, it easily made a good impression on people.\n\n  The middle-aged man led Yin Zhu deeper into the slave market, asking as they walked, \"Little brother, my name is Ge'en. What's your name? Where are you from?\"\n\n  \"My name is Ye Yin Zhu. I'm from Arcadia.\"\n\n  \"Your name is strange. Oh, we're here.\" As he spoke, Ge'en pointed to a huge stable ahead.\n\n  Upon entering the stable, a pungent, foul smell assaulted Yin Zhu, making him frown. He was accustomed to the fresh air of the Jade Sea, and this filthy environment made him feel extremely uncomfortable. There were several dozen Horned Horses in the stable, and the horse dealers were haggling with some customers over prices.\n\n  Ge'en seemed very familiar with this kind of environment. \"The slave market in the city of Roer is just like this. If you go to a slave market in a big city in the future, you'll see massive stables. That's where you'll find top-quality Horned Horses, with at least several hundred to choose from.\"\n\n  The horse dealer seemed to know Ge'en. Seeing him approach, he immediately sent someone over to greet them. \"Well, if it isn't Commander Ge'en. What's this, you're heading out on a mission again? These Horned Horses are all new arrivals. Pick a few.\"\n\n  Ge'en grunted. \"Hart, you think I don't know the quality of your Horned Horses? Alright, pick out twenty strong ones for me. Oh, right, and pick one for this little brother here.\"\n\n  Hart hastily agreed with a smile and quickly went to select the Horned Horses. In a short while, twenty-one Horned Horses had been brought over. Ge'en was clearly a regular customer of his, so he didn't bother to inspect them closely. He took out a coin pouch from his robes. \"The usual deal, five gold coins for two. Here's fifty gold coins, you can count it.\"\n\n  Hart took the pouch and casually tucked it away, smiling. \"Count what? Do you think I don't trust you? Your Iron Thorn Mercenary Corps is the only permanently stationed mercenary corps in our city of Roer, after all.\"\n\n  Ge'en gave a wry smile. \"You think I like being stationed in this godforsaken place? Without strength, it's impossible to establish a foothold in those big cities. Alright, I brought this little brother here. As a favor to me, give him a discount—two gold coins will do. Little brother, go ahead and pick one from these twenty-one. They might not be top-grade Horned Horses, but Hart's stock here has pretty good stamina.\"\n\n  Yin Zhu could naturally tell that the price Ge'en was paying for the horses was a discounted one. \"Thank you, Uncle Ge'en.\" The gold coins he had on him had all been given to the little beggar just now. He subconsciously activated his spiritual energy to retrieve money from his spatial ring. But in the next moment, the expression on his face froze.\n\n  He held out his hands. Eight of his fingers were bare; only the finger that had worn the spatial ring still bore the faint mark of the ring.\n\n  \"Ah! My spatial ring is gone!\" Yin Zhu cried out, a feeling of panic suddenly gripping his heart. The spatial ring itself was extremely valuable, but what was more precious to him were the five ancient zithers inside it! The letter Qin Shang had given him and all his remaining gold coins were also in the ring. Now that the ring was gone, he was instantly left penniless.\n\n  \"Little brother, what's...\" Ge'en was also startled by Yin Zhu's sudden reaction.\n\n  Yin Zhu didn't answer. A cold light flashed in his clear black eyes. Closing them, a faint layer of red light was quietly released from between his eyebrows, forming a dark red magical hexagram in front of him.\n\n  ————————————————————————-\n\n  Hehe, Ye Yin Zhu's ring is gone, and so are his zithers. Please don't curse Xiao San for torturing him. Once he gets to Milan, everything will get better. I won't reveal any more than that. You'll just have to read on and see. By the way, at the end of tomorrow's three chapters, the first beautiful woman of this book is about to make her debut. Please note, I haven't said she's the female lead, nor have I said she isn't. You'll just have to read on and see for yourselves.

    "content": "A welcome to all my reader friends, please add this to your collections and vote. To my brothers with monthly tickets, please give them to Sheng Xiao first. Thank you.\n\n————————————————————————-\n\nA spatial ring and its owner share a spiritual connection, and the ring's seal can only be opened by the owner. Any attempt to force it open will only result in the ring's destruction. There was only one explanation for the ring's disappearance, and Yin Zhu had already figured it out: when he had helped up that little beggar, the boy had bumped into him to distract him and swiped the spatial ring right off his hand.\n\nFor the first time since leaving the Azure Sea, anger surged through Yin Zhu's mind. He had shown kindness and given alms, only to have his most important possession stolen. He was a Zither Mage! Without his ancient zithers, he was completely unable to use his zither magic. Moreover, those five zithers were treasures of the Zither Sect and had been with him for sixteen years. To lose them just like that—how could he not be frantic?\n\nMeanwhile, in a deserted corner of Roer City, the little beggar sealed the box in his hands and muttered to himself, \"To think it was a spatial ring. A pity I can't get the things out of it. Oh well, I'll just keep it as a memento. In this day and age, a truly simple, good-hearted person like him is rare. Let this be a lesson for him. So what if it's a spatial ring? Hmph, with this lead box, don't even think about connecting to it with spiritual waves. A few dozen gold coins is enough for my travel and tuition fees. Father, oh, no, that old goat, just you wait. One day, I will come back to take what is rightfully mine.\" His eyes were large and very bright, but they lacked the clarity of Yin Zhu's. His gaze was filled with hatred and all sorts of complex, negative emotions.\n\nHe tightened his grip on the box containing the ring, and a faint green light flashed past. His small figure quickly vanished.\n\n\"It's over. I can't connect.\" Retracting his spiritual energy, Yin Zhu's face had turned deathly pale.\n\nWhat did losing the spatial ring mean? It meant he had lost the treasures of the Zither Sect, it meant he had lost all his travel money and his letter of introduction to the Milan Academy. \"I have nothing left. What should I do? What on earth should I do?\" Stranded in Bo Pang, he was caught in a dilemma. Continue on to Milan? He no longer had the travel funds or the letter of introduction. Go back? He didn't have the travel funds for that either, and having lost the five ancient zithers, how could he possibly face his teacher, Qin Shang?\n\nGe En and Ha Te did not mock Yin Zhu for being unable to produce any gold coins. On the contrary, a trace of surprise appeared on both their faces.\n\nGe En asked tentatively, \"Little brother, are you alright?\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu said in frustration, \"Uncle, I'm afraid I can't buy the horned horse. My spatial ring is gone, and all my money was inside it.\"\n\nGe En nodded. \"Little brother, from the looks of it just now, you must be a Red-rank high-level magician, right?\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu immediately remembered Qin Shang's instructions and subconsciously nodded. \"Yes, I am!\"\n\nA hint of joy appeared in Ge En's eyes as he continued to ask, \"Then where are you headed now?\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu hesitated for a moment. He thought to himself, *Going back is definitely not an option. I absolutely cannot go back to see Grandpa Qin¹ without finding the spatial ring. I should head to Milan first. Zi said he would find me there. I'll wait until I see Zi and then discuss with him what to do.*\n\n\"I am going to the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy in the Milan Empire.\"\n\n\"Excellent! That's just excellent! The Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy is just outside Milan City, the capital of the Milan Empire. Our mercenary group's current mission is to go to Milan City. Why don't you come with us? Our group will cover your expenses along the way, and when we get there, I'll give you another twenty gold coins. What do you think?\" Ge En said excitedly.\n\nThe blow of suddenly losing everything had been immense, but Ge En's proposal rekindled a spark of hope in Ye Yin Zhu's heart. It had all happened so suddenly that he couldn't help but be a little stunned.\n\nGe En thought Yin Zhu felt the money was too little and quickly added, \"We'll also cover the cost of this horned horse. What's wrong? You're not willing?\"\n\n\"No, no, of course I'm willing. But, Uncle Ge En, could you tell me... what is a mercenary?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" Ge En looked at Yin Zhu, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. The handsome young man before him was looking at him earnestly, not looking like he was joking in the slightest.\n\n\"You don't even know what a mercenary is? Let me tell you,\" Ha Te said from the side. \"Mercenaries are a very widespread profession on the Longqinus Continent. It refers to warriors who fight or carry out missions for an employer purely for profit. You can see mercenaries everywhere. For example, the Palermo Kingdom in the west is also known as the Mercenary Kingdom, because several of the continent's largest mercenary groups are stationed within its borders. The treatment and status of mercenaries are highest there.\"\n\n\"So that's how it is. Uncle Ge En, are you asking me to be a mercenary?\" Ye Yin Zhu asked.\n\nGe En nodded. \"A temporary mercenary, you could say. To be honest, our Iron Thorn Mercenary Group really doesn't have the funds to hire a magician long-term. This time, we're escorting a shipment of goods and their owner to Milan City. The journey is mostly safe. Think of it as us helping each other out. How about it?\"\n\nLooking at Ge En's sincere gaze, some of the gloom that had settled in Yin Zhu's heart from losing the ring dissipated. \"Uncle Ge En, you're truly a good person. Of course I'm willing.\" In that moment, he had completely forgotten that the little beggar who had stolen his ring had also called him a good person.\n\n\"Good, then let's go. Ha Te, have your men bring the horned horse to us later. Same old place.\" Ge En was clearly in a good mood. He put his arm around Ye Yin Zhu's shoulder and walked out of the slave market.\n\nWatching their retreating backs, Ha Te chuckled. \"Ge En's luck is really something else, finding a magician this naive. The Iron Thorn group finally has a magician. Even if it's only temporary, it's enough for them to get their rank upgraded.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu didn't know that the status of magicians on the Longqinus Continent was far higher than he had imagined. It was the noblest of professions. Even a Red-rank magician held a much higher status than a warrior of the same rank. Magicians were extremely proud and rarely deigned to join professions like mercenary work; most pledged their allegiance to various kingdoms. Whether or not a mercenary group had a magician was always a key indicator of its strength. And the price to hire one was exorbitant.\n\nMercenary groups were divided into eight ranks, from highest to lowest: S, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Among them, E, F, and G-rank were known as low-tier mercenary groups; C and D-rank were mid-tier; B-rank was high-tier; and S and A-rank were super-tier. The Iron Thorn Mercenary Group was currently an E-rank group. They had completed enough missions, but to advance from low-tier to the mid-tier D-rank, they needed to have a magician in their roster to pass the Mercenary Guild's review. This was the main reason Ge En was willing to hire Yin Zhu for this mission, which wasn't even particularly dangerous.\n\nThe Iron Thorn Mercenary Group was quartered in a courtyard near the north gate of Roer City. It was composed entirely of men, with a total of sixty-seven members, including their leader, Ge En. Among them were twenty two-handed heavy sword warriors, ten archers, ten light cavalry, and the largest contingent of twenty-seven spear-and-shield warriors. It was a relatively well-rounded force. The group had been established for six years, and most of its members were between the ages of twenty-five and forty. Ge En was a Green-level Earth Warrior, and it was because of him that Iron Thorn had managed to rise to E-rank within five years. His goal was to reach D-rank and enter the ranks of mid-tier mercenary groups, where their hiring fees would increase substantially.\n\n***\n\n¹ The original text uses 秦爺爺 (Qin Yeye), an affectionate term meaning \"Grandpa Qin,\" for his teacher, Qin Shang.",

Just follow me.\"\n\n\n\nYe Yinzhu looked at the busy soldiers, \"Uncle Geen, you have more than 60 soldiers in your army. Why did you just buy twenty horned horses? You don't want to ride?\"\n\n\n\nGehn smiled bitterly, \"I want to buy it for everyone, but the problem is that the horns I bought are limited in the military group. They are all for the purpose of pulling goods and delivering to the employer. If it weren't for the employer's money, I would never give up on twenty horses. We are all ill-fated outside.

This little brother is Ye Yinzhu, the new member of our army group. He will go to Milan with us.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, I'm a newcomer again. I look a little thin. The team leader. What is his profession?\" A soldier in his thirties asked curiously.\n\n\n\nGehn smiled mysteriously, \"From now on, we have magicians, we have magicians. When we finish our mission in Milan this time, we can register the rank of D-level soldiers in the military association there.\"\n\n\n\nAs soon as this statement came out, the soldiers were collectively shouting. They had been waiting for this day for too long. The improvement of the soldiers' team level directly related to their income and became soldiers. It was just for money. For a while, Yinzhu became the contact of the soldiers. A curiously looked at the handsome young man asking Dongxi. Some people even wanted to let Yinzhu play magic and see.\n\n\n\n\"Okay, okay, you all give me peace of mind, don't be afraid of Brother Ye.\" Gehn touched the cold sweat on his head. He knew that magicians were all very arrogant. His subordinates made him show magic. Once he withdrew from anger, how can he do it.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry, my magic can't be displayed for you.\" Yin Zhu said embarrassedly, \"Without the piano in his hand, what can he put on without the piano in his hand.\"\n\n\n\nGehn hurriedly said, \"That's right, you guys all give me some peace of mind. Magic is a singular bamboo that can be seen at will. Don't you pay attention to them. By the way, your magician badge has been destroyed. If there is one, it's best to bring it on.\"\n\n\n\nThe magician's badge is really not broken. That day, Yinzhu took the badge from the Luna City Magician Guild and put it on her hands. The map and the mask given by Zi were still there because they were not placed in the ring.He took out a red badge from the ground and wore it on his left chest. Although Ye Yinzhu, who is only sixteen years old, looks a little tender, at least the badge on his chest has proved that his professional identity is not fake. There is a special magic wave. In order to create this badge, Qin Man also took a drop of Yinzhu's blood to the guild. As long as it is not broken, it will accompany Yinzhu for the whole life. As long as it is level-up, it can be directly upgraded to the Magician Guild.\n\n\n\nAs soon as the badge came out, the soldiers calmed down and continued to be busy with their gratitude.\n\n\n\n\"Gern Group, how are you preparing?\" A whispering voice came from the door. Yin Zhu followed Geen and turned back to the head. He only felt that his mental power was slightly shaking.\n\n\n\nA woman appeared at the door of the yard, walking in. Her simple white long skirt reflected the rich light on her body. Most of the long blue hair like a sea rippling sea were scattered behind her, but there was a hanging on her chest on each side, covering her ears with a soft light, a small and straight nose, a long and beautiful neck, a red lips, and a soft face outlined by the gods. She looked like a goddess who descended to earth, with a slender figure and a straight figure. Only two white and tender calves were exposed from the long skirt.\n\n\n\nHer walking movements were very gentle, leisurely and as relaxed as a scattered body, like a moving lily flying over the clouds.\n\n\n\nYin Zhu was confused in her eyes because he couldn't see the exact age of the woman. At first glance, she seemed to be as young as a girl, but when she looked carefully, she didn't have the youthfulness of a girl, and her noble and elegant temperament was enough to make those who imagined themselves.\n\n\n\nThe woman's appearance attracted all the soldiers' gazes, but after watching for a while, they lowered their heads. Even Geen was no exception. As if he continued to watch, he would have dug the \"goddess\" in front of them. Generally, only Ye Yinzhu's confused gaze finally fell on the woman. As if he was standing there, in the entire courtyard, only his invisible scattering of atmosphere could be compared with that girl.\n\n\n\nI don’t know why, Yin Zhu suddenly felt very close to the woman who appeared. Her breath made him feel very comfortable. This feeling only appeared on his teacher Qin Feng.\n\n\n\nThe woman soon noticed Yinzhu's attention. Her soft eyes touched Yinzhu in the air. She felt her eyes lit up, and a burst of surprise appeared on her pretty face. Two strange lights radiated from her beautiful eyes, without any maliciousness, but the one who was trying to find the surname was gently brushing against Yinzhu's eyes.\n\n\n\nYe Yinzhu was a little dazed in the sea of brain, and his eyes became dizzy, and his brain was dazed, but in that moment, he recovered his normal, pure and careless innocent heart without any confusion. It is precisely for this reason that Yinzhu's progress in cultivation was so fast. Whether it was mental power or mental ambition, he was worthy of Qin Duo's reputation for his genius.Under the stimulation of the strange light in the woman's eyes, the dark red light was once again released from the center of his eyebrows, forming a barrier of mental power. This pure mental power level trial was the most beloved between the magicians and used to judge the other party's strength.\n\n\n\n\"How is that possible?\" The shock in the woman's eyes became even more intense, \"Gen Group Chief, don't you introduce it to me.\"\n\n\n\nOnly then did Guen realize that he was not calm in his heart. This was not the first time he had seen her. Why did he still do this? He hurriedly said, \"Miss Anya, this magician Ye Yinzhu, whom I am new to, will also participate in our mission. With him joining us, we will definitely be able to better protect you and your goods.\"\n\n\n\nAfter hearing Geen's words, Ye Yinzhu realized that the elegant and noble woman in front of her was the employer of this trip.\n\n\n\n\"Hello, Sister Anya.\" Yinzhu's clear black eyes looked at Anya, subconsciously landing on her plump breasts, thinking to herself, Sister Anya's chest muscles are so strong and powerful.\n\n\n\nAnya was angry at first when she saw Yinzhu looking at her shameful part, but when she saw Yinzhu's unconventional gaze, the anger in her heart quietly disappeared, just like Yinzhu felt for her. Facing this handsome and extremely handsome young man, she felt a little bit of favor in her heart. It was not because of Yinzhu's appearance, but because of the lack of confusing breath on him.\n\n\n\n a href=http: \" target=\"_blank\" class=\"linkcontent\">wwwcmfucom=\"\">Qiddit Chinese Network Broadcasting friends are welcome to read.

    "content": "Here is today's third chapter. I got back late tonight, so I'm posting these two chapters together. My apologies. Please forgive me, fellow readers.\n\n---\n\n\"Hello, and welcome to the team. Pardon me for asking, but are you truly just a Red-ranked magician?\"\n\nYin Zhu nodded. \"Yes! High-tier Red.\" Perhaps because he was lying, his face immediately turned red.\n\nAn Ya didn't call him out on it. She smiled faintly and said, \"Having a powerful magician join us is always a good thing.\"\n\nGe En said, \"Praise Falan. Miss An Ya, we're just about ready. We'll definitely be able to depart on time tomorrow morning.\"\n\nAn Ya smiled and nodded. \"Then I can rest easy. I'll let you get back to your work. See you at the city gate tomorrow morning.\" With that, she turned and departed elegantly.\n\n\"Praise Falan, she's finally gone.\" Ge En subconsciously wiped the sweat from his forehead.\n\nYin Zhu asked curiously, \"Uncle Ge En, are you afraid of Sister An Ya?\"\n\nGe En said, \"It's not fear. I don't know why, but in her presence, I always feel like I can't hold my head high. She's the most beautiful and noble woman I've ever seen. To be honest, I can't even bring myself to have a single profane thought about her.\"\n\n\"Profane thoughts? What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Well... you'll understand when you're older.\"\n\nYin Zhu's gaze was still fixed on the door. \"Uncle Ge En, Sister An Ya is a magician, too.\"\n\n\"What?\" Ge En jumped, looking at Yin Zhu in surprise. \"That can't be. She seems to be just a merchant.\"\n\nYin Zhu said seriously, \"She's definitely a magician. She probed me with her spiritual power just now. There's no mistake.\"\n\nA thoughtful glint appeared in Ge En's eyes; his mind was clearly not as rugged as his appearance. \"No wonder she'd come all the way to a place like Roer by herself to purchase tea leaves. So she's a noble magician. Yin Zhu, can you tell what rank she is? Is she stronger than you?\"\n\nYin Zhu shook his head. \"I can't tell her rank, but she's definitely stronger than me.\"\n\n\"In that case, she might be an Orange-ranked magician.\" Ge En sighed inwardly, thankful he hadn't entertained any wicked ideas about his client; offending a magician was never wise. He didn't know, however, that in terms of magical ability, the Yin Zhu before him was already at the level of a high-tier Yellow-rank, and that An Ya obviously couldn't be a mere Orange-rank.\n\nOut of respect for magicians, Ge En arranged a private room for Yin Zhu. Sitting on the bed, Yin Zhu was troubled. He had tried several more times to contact his spatial ring using his spiritual power, but had failed each time. Moreover, he had a faint feeling that the ring was getting farther and farther away from him.\n\n\"Why? Why did you steal my ring? Didn't I already give you a gold coin? My qin are gone...\" Yin Zhu discovered a sudden, intense longing for his instruments. For sixteen years, he had been with his qin almost every day; they had long since become his best companions. Now that all of them were lost, the feeling of desolation was heart-wrenching.\n\nSitting cross-legged, he began to cultivate his Bamboo Dou Qi in an effort to calm his mind. A yellow light quietly emerged from his body, forming a soft barrier that enveloped him. The Dou Qi flowed endlessly through his meridians, and the fresh, gentle sensation gradually dispelled the anxiety and worry in his heart, allowing him to enter a state of deep meditation.\n\nBamboo Dou Qi was divided into three realms: Green Bamboo, Yellow Bamboo, and Purple Bamboo. Unlike the continent's seven-colored rainbow ranking system, this cultivation had its own color progression. Each realm was composed of nine tiers. The pale yellow light currently emitting from him signified the first tier of the Yellow Bamboo realm. In terms of power, his Dou Qi was actually slightly higher than his Qin Magic, equivalent to the first grade of the Green rank in the continental system—the level of an Earth Warrior. However, his Dou Qi served mainly to supplement his Qin Magic.\n\nEarly the next morning, as the first rays of sunlight touched the earth, the north gate of Roer City was already bustling with activity. The sixty-eight members of the Iron Thorn Mercenary Corps were assembled and ready to depart. Of the three horse-drawn carriages, the first and last were loaded with goods, while the one in the middle was for their client, An Ya. Twenty of the corps' burliest heavy swordsmen surrounded the three carriages, with archers beside them. On the outer perimeter were twenty-seven spear-and-shield warriors. Ten light cavalrymen rode ahead to clear the way. The twenty newly purchased Horned Horses, apart from those pulling the carriages, carried the group's supplies. Everything was arranged in an orderly fashion.\n\nAs the magician, Ye Yin Zhu was assigned to ride beside the middle carriage. It was his first time on a Horned Horse, and he felt a mixture of excitement and alarm. Although the Horned Horse's gait was a bit bumpy, the gentle-natured Tier 1 magical beast was easy to handle, and he soon grew accustomed to being in the saddle. After all, his physical condition was nowhere near as frail as he appeared.\n\nAt that moment, Yin Zhu's gaze was fixed on Ge En, the leader of the Iron Thorn Mercenary Corps, at the head of the formation, his eyes filled with admiration and astonishment. Ge En wasn't just an Earth Warrior; he was an Earth Knight. And his mount was, astoundingly, a domesticated dragon. A Tier 4 Green-Ridged Earth Drake, it stood over two meters tall and was five meters long. With relatively small forelimbs, it supported its body on two powerful hind legs. Its entire body was a murky green. In addition to its charging power, this Tier 4 drake had decent defenses and could spit corrosive acid. Though a lower-tier breed among domesticated dragons, it was far stronger than common magical beasts. With it, Ge En—himself an initial-stage Green-rank—could contend with a mid-stage Green-ranked Earth Warrior. The drake was the prize of the entire Iron Thorn Mercenary Corps, and it had cost Ge En a great deal of effort to acquire.\n\nThe mercenaries wore leather armor, and their pace was brisk. Within a morning, they had left Roer City far behind, heading deeper into the Kingdom of Popang. Making good time was the primary goal. Ge En only called for a short rest after every *shichen*¹ of travel. At high noon, they had a simple meal of dry rations and immediately set out again.\n\n\"Yin Zhu.\" The carriage curtain was lifted, revealing An Ya's captivating face.\n\n\"Sister An Ya, do you need something?\" Ye Yin Zhu politely greeted the beautiful and noble client.\n\nAn Ya smiled. \"You're a magician, why trouble yourself with riding? You should come join me in the carriage. It looks like this is your first time on a Horned Horse, and I doubt you'll be able to stand it for long. This journey to Milan will probably take us a month.\"\n\n\"Alright!\" Yin Zhu agreed readily, hopping off his Horned Horse and climbing right into the carriage.\n\n***\n¹A *shichen* is a traditional Chinese unit of time equal to two hours.",

    "content": "The featured post event will be held here tomorrow night. Fellow readers are welcome to join, bookmark, and vote. Brothers with monthly tickets,¹ please vote for Sheng Xiao first, thank you.\n\n————————————————————————-\n\nYe Yin Zhu didn’t know what politeness was, nor did he understand the relationship between an employer and a mercenary. To act according to one's nature was the true essence of the pure heart of a child. After half a day of riding the horned horse, the novelty had worn off, and the feeling of monotony had already made him a bit impatient. The mercenaries of Iron Thorn were all very serious when on a mission, rarely even chatting.\n\nThe carriage was spacious, and with only An Ya inside, it seemed rather empty. Various foods and drinks were laid out in the carriage, and the seats were wide with thick, soft cushions, making them much more comfortable than a horse's back.\n\nAn Ya was still in a long white dress, and leaning against the soft cushion gave her a more languid air. Sitting face to face, a fresh fragrance drifted over from her, and Yin Zhu couldn't help but take a deep breath. The heart-refreshing scent made him feel very comfortable. He said sincerely, \"Sister An Ya, you're so beautiful.\"\n\nAn Ya had heard plenty of compliments, but hearing it from the innocent Yin Zhu, it had a different feel. She smiled faintly and said, \"Yin Zhu, how did you end up joining the Iron Thorn Mercenary Group?\"\n\nYin Zhu didn't hide anything and recounted what had happened yesterday. Fortunately, he remembered Zi's warning before he left and didn't mention the five guqins inside his space ring.\n\n\"So that's what happened. You are too kind. Yin Zhu, in this world, sometimes you can't be too kind, or you'll just get bullied.\"\n\nHearing An Ya's consoling words, Yin Zhu couldn't help but think of that detestable little beggar again and said hatefully, \"Next time, I definitely won't be.\" Being innocent didn't mean he couldn't get angry.\n\nAn Ya glanced at the magic emblem on Yin Zhu's chest. Ge En and the other mercenaries who were unfamiliar with magic might not be able to tell, but how could she not see the peculiarity of Yin Zhu's emblem? \"Yin Zhu, the design on your emblem is very strange. What school of magician are you?\"\n\n\"I am a Divine Music Master. The emblem is carved with a design of my instrument.\"\n\n\"Ah? A Divine Music Master?\" An Ya was stunned, and her gaze toward Yin Zhu instantly turned peculiar.\n\n\"What's wrong? Sister An Ya, is there something strange about that?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing. I was just wondering why a boy like you would choose the profession of a Divine Music Master. I know some Divine Music Masters, but they're all female. Does this mean you don't have your own magical beast?\"\n\nYin Zhu said, \"Does a magician have to have a magical beast?\"\n\nThe surprise in An Ya's eyes had vanished without a trace. \"Of course. A magical beast is the best guarantee for a magician's safety. A magician without a magical beast is very unsafe. After all, a magician's close combat ability is too weak. As the noblest profession on the continent, the reason magicians are respected, aside from their rarity, is largely because of their own power. It's not obvious at the lower levels, but once they enter the Yellow-rank, a magician can easily deal with multiple warriors of the same level. And a magical beast is a magician's best protection. For a magician, a magical beast can be considered a shield; it just needs to hold off the enemy's attack until the magician finishes chanting their spell. A powerful magical beast can even attack the enemy alongside the magician. Only a magician with a magical beast has the strongest individual combat capability. Didn't you know?\"\n\n\"Grandpa seemed to have mentioned magical beasts, but he said it wasn't time for me to have one yet.\" In order to let Yin Zhu devote himself fully to cultivating the pure heart of a child, Qin Shang rarely discussed things with him other than the zither.\n\nAn Ya said admiringly, \"Then your grandfather must be a powerful magician. Any magician has only one chance in their life to sign a contract with a magical beast. He must hope that you sign a contract with a powerful magical beast after you become strong. It's a pity you're a Divine Music Master.\" As she said this, her gaze on Yin Zhu softened even more. Yin Zhu could clearly feel that An Ya's gaze seemed somewhat similar to his mother's.\n\n\"Sister, tell me stories about magical beasts. Do you have your own magical beast?\"\n\nAn Ya smiled slightly and said, \"Naturally I do, otherwise, how would I dare to travel so far by myself? Magical beasts are a magician's best partner. Generally speaking, magicians will choose to sign contracts with magical beasts that are strong in close combat and defense, as this offers them the greatest protection. Among magical beasts, flying ones are the most precious because they can buy the magician more time. Once a master-servant contract is established between a magician and a magical beast, the beast can never betray its master for its entire life, and the magician must not abandon their magical beast. Therefore, this single opportunity to sign a contract becomes extremely valuable. Yin Zhu, before we set out today, I heard from Captain Ge En that you're going to study at the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts, right? I can't let you call me 'big sister' for nothing. If you're willing, how about I find a way to give you a magical beast?\"\n\nHearing An Ya say this, Yin Zhu's eyes immediately revealed excitement, but soon, the excitement vanished. He shook his head and said, \"Sister An Ya, thank you for your kind offer, but Grandpa said I shouldn't casually accept things from others.\"\n\n\"You've already called me sister, so how are we still 'others'? It's a gift from your big sister, so of course you should accept it.\" Looking at the handsome and innocent Yin Zhu, An Ya's fondness for him grew. The main reason she wanted to give him a magical beast was because of his profession as a Divine Music Master. As a branch of spiritual-type magicians, a Divine Music Master's offensive power had always been overlooked. And the most important part of contracting a magical beast is to first defeat it. Relying on their own power, it is very difficult for a Divine Music Master to obtain a magical beast contract. Influenced by her goodwill toward Yin Zhu, she wanted to give him a magical beast to give him some means of protecting himself, lest this simple-hearted little brother be bullied at the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts.\n\n\"Can I really?\"\n\n\"Of course. But, your sister needs to think about what kind of magical beast to give you. After all, this is the only chance in your life. It would be best if we could find a growth-type magical beast. I'll help you look when we get to Milan.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu had no idea what An Ya's casual mention of a \"growth-type magical beast\" represented. Even among the intelligent-type magical beasts of the seventh rank and above, growth-type magical beasts were extremely rare. And any intelligent-type magical beast would fetch a heavenly price on the market—if one could even be found. Moreover, subduing an intelligent-type magical beast was no easy task.\n\n\"Sister, can you let me see your magical beast?\" Yin Zhu looked at An Ya with hopeful eyes.\n\nAn Ya smiled and shook her head. \"Not here. We'll talk about it later when we're somewhere with no people. Huh, Yin Zhu, your hands...\"\n\nYin Zhu held out both his hands in front of An Ya. \"I was born like this. Grandpa said that being born with eight fingers prevents any self-interference when I play the zither. Sister An Ya, what rank of magician are you? Yesterday when you were testing me, I seemed to feel a strong fluctuation of the water element from you.\"\n\nAn Ya was startled. \"You could feel the water element fluctuations on me?\"\n\nYin Zhu nodded. \"Yes!\"\n\nAn Ya said seriously, \"Yin Zhu, are you really just a Divine Music Master? Why is your spiritual power so sharp?\"\n\nYin Zhu scratched his head, looking a bit lost. \"I don't know either. I just said what I felt.\"\n\nAn Ya sighed softly. \"You silly boy, don't ask others the same question in the future. Magicians mostly have peculiar tempers; it's easy to arouse others' suspicions.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Monthly Tickets:** A virtual item on Chinese web novel platforms that readers can give to their favorite novels to support the author and boost the novel's ranking.",

Sister An Ya, you have a very good temper. Oh, right, Sister An Ya, why are women's chest muscles more developed than men's?\" Yin Zhu's gaze naturally fell on An Ya's chest as he asked curiously.\n\nAn Ya never would have thought Yin Zhu would suddenly ask such a question. Stared at by his intense gaze, she suddenly felt a tingling sensation across her chest. In her entire life, he was the first man who dared to ask her such a blunt question, and yet, she couldn't see a trace of lewdness in Yin Zhu's eyes.\n\n\"You... go home and ask your mother.\" Flustered, An Ya crossed her hands over her chest, her pretty face turning pink, looking vibrant and extremely alluring.\n\n\"I never had the chance to ask before! Grandpa didn't allow me to ask about anything other than studying the zither. Sister An Ya, your face is so red. Are you not feeling well?\"\n\n\"I... You little rascal, you've really defeated me.\" An Ya sighed helplessly. If anyone else had asked this, she probably would have lashed out long ago. \"You can't ask other girls the same question in the future. This is a physiological difference between men and women. You'll understand naturally when you're a bit older. Staring at a female's chest is very impolite, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh. I see! Sister An Ya, you're so good to me. It's a shame I lost my zither, otherwise, I would definitely play a song for you.\" Yin Zhu seemed to understand something.\n\nJust as Ge'en had judged, the journey from the Bopang Kingdom to the Milan Empire was uneventful. Traveling along the main roads, they reached the border between the two nations twenty days later. Along the way, Yin Zhu spent most of his time with An Ya, much to the envy of the mercenaries. He listened to her tell interesting stories about the continent, and the common sense An Ya taught him was more than he had learned in over ten years at the Azure Sea. An Ya was not only as gentle as water but also very patient, making him no longer as clueless about basic knowledge as he was before.\n\n\"Once we cross the mountain ahead, we'll enter Milan's territory. It's about another ten days or so north to reach Milan City,\" An Ya said to Yin Zhu, who was standing beside the carriage.\n\nThe Iron Thorn mercenaries, except for those on watch, were resting in the shade of the trees by the road. Hearing An Ya's words, Ge'en laughed and said, \"The Milan Empire is even more peaceful than the Bopang Kingdom. Once we're past here, the mission will be more than halfway complete.\"\n\n\"Huh, what's that sound?\" Yin Zhu's expression shifted, and he looked as if he were listening intently.\n\nGe'en said in surprise, \"What sound? I don't hear anything. Could it be that your ears are even better than mine?\"\n\nAn Ya's face grew a little more solemn. \"There really is a sound, but it's still very far away. Although I can't hear it, the ground is vibrating slightly.\" As she said this, she glanced at Yin Zhu beside her, thinking to herself, *His hearing is actually better than mine. Is this an advantage of a Divine Music Master?* In the twenty-odd days they had spent together, Yin Zhu felt like a flawless blank slate to her—pure of heart and curious about everything. The spiritual energy he unintentionally released didn't seem like something a Red-rank magician could possess. And yet, the color of his spiritual energy was indeed red. Imperceptibly, this innocent and handsome young man struck her as somewhat mysterious. Although Yin Zhu was naive, whenever she asked about his origins, he would fall silent.\n\nThe sound gradually grew louder, and the mercenaries could now hear it clearly. It was a thunderous rumble, filled with a suppressive force, coming from their flank. A massive \"earth dragon\" of dust rose into the sky, similar to the one from the heavy cavalry Yin Zhu and Zi had encountered, but this time its momentum was far beyond what that cavalry could compare to.\n\n\"Form up.\" Although he didn't know what was coming, Ge'en reacted at once, shouting to rally his men. The experienced mercenaries quickly formed a battle line. Spear-and-shield warriors were at the front, followed by greatsword warriors and archers. Ten light cavalrymen split into two groups to protect the flanks, shielding the three carriages and Yin Zhu behind them. Ge'en stood at the head of the formation, his two-handed greatsword resting on his shoulder, his expression grave as he watched the direction of the dust cloud. The Green-ridged Earth Dragon beneath him growled low, appearing uneasy, and corrosive saliva even dripped from the corner of its mouth, sizzling as it hit the ground.\n\nThe bright sunlight made the distant cloud of dust seem even more distinct. The thunderous roar caused the earth to tremble violently.\n\n\"Ah! It's dragon cavalry! Put away your weapons, quickly!\" Ge'en shouted in a panic, clumsily slinging his two-handed greatsword back onto his back. The members of the Iron Thorn Mercenary Group all did the same. They looked as if they had encountered something terrifying. But in their frightened eyes, there was also a hint of respect, and even more so, envy and a touch of jealousy.\n\nWhat is dragon cavalry? Cavalry who use dragons as mounts are called dragon cavalry. The cause of the soaring \"earth dragon\" was precisely such a unit of cavalry. There were about a hundred of them. At the very front was an enormous golden dragon. Over ten meters long and four meters tall, its massive body made Ge'en's Green-ridged Earth Dragon seem minuscule. This golden dragon also had no wings and walked on four limbs. Its head was somewhat pointed, and on top of it, a meter-long horn shimmered with the brilliance of a golden crystal. Its thick dragon scales were clearly visible even from a distance, densely layered over its massive body. Its tail was very long, covered with triangular spikes, and its tip, which forked into three ends, was slightly upturned, not touching the ground, and shimmered with a cerulean light.\n\nBehind the golden dragon was a uniform troop of entirely cyan dragons. They were two meters tall and three meters long, with a semi-upright posture. Something like a saddle secured the knights on their backs. Although they ran on only two legs, their speed was incredible, and they kept pace right behind the leading golden dragon.\n\n\"That's a Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon and Erikmin Dragons,\" An Ya said nonchalantly. Faced with the imposing dragon cavalry, she showed no sign of alarm. Also unafraid was Yin Zhu, who watched the squadrons of tamed dragons with only curiosity in his eyes.\n\n\"Sister An Ya, what level dragons are they?\"\n\n\"The Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon is one of the more powerful types of tamed dragons. Its strength can even be compared to that of a true dragon—a low-tier one, of course. It's the king of earth dragons. A level-six magical beast, metal-elemental, second only to intelligent magical beasts. Its own defense is extremely high, and combined with its innate metal-elemental magic, it's enough to let it dominate the land. See, its horn and tail are where it releases its innate magic. As for the Erikmin Dragons, they're nothing special. They're low-tier tamed dragons, ranging from level four to five. The larger, faster ones are level five, the lesser ones are level four. In terms of strength, they're about the same as Commander Ge'en's Green-ridged Earth Dragon and are also a type of earth dragon. Their main characteristic is extreme speed. In terms of speed alone, their short-range acceleration can even surpass that of the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon.\"\n\nQidian Chinese Network (www.cmfu.com) welcomes all book lovers to come and read.

Thank you.\n\n————————————————————————\n\nAs Anya was speaking, the dragoons had already drawn near. They had obviously spotted the Iron Thorn Mercenary Corps as well, and their advance began to slow. Now that they were closer, Ye Yin Zhu could see a man in his thirties seated atop the Golden Crystal Tyrannosaurus. A heavy, seven-meter-long dragon lance was slung by his leg, and an ancient-looking longsword hung at his waist. His silver armor glinted in the sunlight. He wore no helmet, his long golden hair flowing behind him. He was tall and straight-backed with ordinary features, but a five-inch scar ran from the corner of his left eye down to his chin, giving him a ferocious air. On the left breast of his silver armor was a palm-sized silver hexagram bearing a violet insignia, displaying his family crest.\n\nFacing the oppressive aura of the Golden Crystal Tyrannosaurus, Gern’s Green-Spined Land Dragon trembled as it growled.\n\n\"Praise Falan. Greetings, esteemed Dragoon Captain. It is my honor to meet you here.\" Gern hastily dismounted his Green-Spined Land Dragon, placed his right hand over his left breast, and gave the Dragoon Captain on the Golden Crystal Tyrannosaurus a respectful knight's salute.\n\nThe Dragoon Captain merely glanced at him and said coolly, \"Praise Falan. Your origins?\" Behind him, the dragoons had come to a halt in perfect formation, without a single sound, fully demonstrating the quality of the unit.\n\nGern did not get angry at the other's coldness in the slightest. He hurriedly replied, \"E-rank Iron Thorn Mercenary Corps. We are currently on an escort mission.\"\n\nThe Dragoon Captain raised a hand and pointed forward. \"My partner is hungry. Give up five of your horned horses for its meal. Here are twenty gold coins as your compensation.\" As he spoke, he casually tossed out a coin purse. He was still twenty paces from Gern, but the purse reached him in an instant. Gern subconsciously reached out to catch it, but a powerful force from the bag sent him stumbling back several steps, nearly causing him to fall.\n\n\"Careful, Uncle.\" Yin Zhu supported Gern from behind, saving him from making a fool of himself on the spot.\n\nAfter throwing the coin purse, the Dragoon Captain didn't spare Gern another glance. He gently patted the thick back of the Golden Crystal Tyrannosaurus with a doting expression; clearly, this was the \"partner\" he had spoken of.\n\nA flash of anger crossed Gern’s eyes, but he truly did not dare to offend the Dragoon Captain before him. However, the number of horned horses in their party was just enough for their needs. If he gave five to the other party, the mercenary corps would have no place for their supplies.\n\n\"Did you have to use so much force? Why should our horned horses be fed to your land dragon?\" Gern was horrified to find that Ye Yin Zhu had, at some point, stepped forward. His clear and pleasant voice was filled with a hint of anger.\n\nThe Dragoon Captain's brow furrowed slightly as he looked up at Yin Zhu. Yin Zhu was also looking at him. Although the Dragoon Captain looked down from a superior height, Yin Zhu's gaze did not waver in the slightest, his clear black eyes revealing a hint of stubbornness.\n\n\"A magician?\" The Dragoon Captain's voice softened somewhat. Magicians were also a noble class, even if the insignia on Ye Yin Zhu’s chest only represented the Red Rank.\n\nYe Yin Zhu nodded. \"Our horned horses are not for sale. If we sell them, we won't have any left for our own use.\"\n\nBy now, Gern had come to his senses and quickly pulled Yin Zhu behind him. He was all too familiar with the pride and power of the dragoons and feared Yin Zhu would suffer for his words. \"My apologies, Lord Dragoon Captain, but we truly have no spare horned horses. You see...\"\n\nA cold glint flashed in the Dragoon Captain's eyes. He was growing impatient. \"If any one of you can block a single strike from my lance, you may go. Otherwise, leave the horned horses.\"\n\n\"What gives you the right to be such a tyrant?\" Yin Zhu looked up, glaring angrily at the Dragoon Captain.\n\nThe Dragoon Captain stated two words faintly, \"Strength.\" Yes, on the Longqinus Continent, strength decided everything.\n\n\"Quite a display of power! Viscount Austin, it has been a long time. How about you let me block your dragon lance?\" Anya's elegant and captivating voice came from behind Yin Zhu and Gern. Hearing this voice, the Dragoon Captain, Austin, trembled. His gaze, which had not once properly regarded Yin Zhu's party, immediately shifted over.\n\nWith a soft \"Ah,\" Austin leaped from the back of the Golden Crystal Tyrannosaurus. \"Praise Falan, Lady Anya, so this is your party.\" As he spoke, he placed his right hand on the silver star over his left breast. It was the same knight's salute, but his execution was far more standard than Gern's.\n\n\"Praise Falan.\" Anya raised her right hand, allowing Austin to complete the ritual of kissing it.\n\nThe Dragoon Captain's sudden change in attitude completely stunned the mercenaries of Iron Thorn. They never would have imagined that a Dragoon Captain would speak in such a tone, would be so respectful to their employer.\n\n\"Lady Anya, what are you doing here?\"\n\nAnya said faintly, \"I came to Bopang to purchase some goods and hired the Iron Thorn Mercenary Corps as an escort. I did not expect to run into you here, Viscount. Weren't you in Milan City?\"\n\nAustin glanced at Anya, a look of intoxication flashing across his eyes. \"I was escorting a shipment of military supplies to Bopang. As you know, the Bopang Kingdom has always been a partner of Milan. The mission is complete, and I was preparing to return to Milan City. You must be heading back as well. How about you let us escort you? An E-rank mercenary corps is utterly unworthy of your status.\"\n\nAnya snorted. \"Forget it. I'll be satisfied as long as your dragon lance isn't pointed at me. How could I dare trouble you?\"\n\nAustin smiled bitterly. \"I was rude just now. I truly did not know you were here, my lady. Austin's dragon lance may be sharp, but it would never be pointed at you!\"\n\nAnya said coolly, \"In that case, please be on your way, Viscount. I'm sure you have to hurry back to Milan City to report on your mission.\"\n\n\"My lady, are you sure you don't require our escort?\"\n\nAnya glanced at him and asked in return, \"Do you think I need it?\"\n\nAustin laughed self-deprecatingly. \"In that case, Austin will take his leave. When you return to Milan City, I will come to your door to atone.\" As he spoke, he first took several steps back before springing into the air, clearing the several-meter height of the Golden Crystal Tyrannosaurus in a single leap. Before leaving, he gave Ye Yin Zhu a pointed look, and in his eyes, Yin Zhu saw a trace of hostility.\n\nThe dragoons were incredibly fast, disappearing in the blink of an eye. Only this time, the advance of Austin and his dragoons was much lighter, kicking up far less dust.\n\nWatching the dragoons' retreating figures, Gern walked over to Anya and said anxiously, \"Lady Anya, I'm sorry...\"\n\nAnya smiled faintly, the iciness on her face gone. \"There is nothing to be sorry for. Even an A-rank mercenary corps would not have reacted much better than you when facing dragoons. After all, they are humanity's ultimate soldiers. We should get going, Corps Leader Gern.\" With that, she returned to her carriage before Gern could say anything more, seemingly oblivious to the respectful gazes of the mercenaries.\n\n\"Uncle, don't just stand there daydreaming. We should go,\" Ye Yin Zhu said, patting Gern's shoulder.\n\n\"Ah!\" Gern finally snapped out of it, thinking to himself that his employer's identity was clearly extraordinary. It was best not to ask too many questions. One shouldn't seek to know things one shouldn't, lest it bring unnecessary trouble. Someone even a Dragoon Captain had to respect was not a person he could afford to offend. It was best to complete this mission as quickly as possible.\n\n\"Yin Zhu, thank you for what you did just now.\"",

    "content": "To thank my book friends for their support, a community highlight event¹ will be held here tonight at 12:05 AM. All friends are welcome to join. At the same time, Xiao San will be releasing four chapters today. The update times for the next three chapters are 5 PM, 8 PM, and 12 AM tonight. Please add this to your collection and vote. Hehe.\n\n  ———————————————————\n\n  Yin Zhu smiled. \"What's there to thank me for? I was just speaking my mind. Those Dragon Cavalry are really domineering. Especially that Dragon General, it was as if he was ordering us around. If Milan's Dragon Cavalry are so arrogant in the Pom Kingdom, do they plan to fly up to the heavens in the Milan Empire?\"\n\n  Ge'en sighed. \"Brother, you don't understand! The status of the Dragon Cavalry on the continent is second only to mages. A Dragon General's status is even higher than a mage's; only high-level mages can be compared to them. The number of Dragon Cavalry has even become the standard for measuring the strength between nations. A hundred-man Dragon Cavalry company like the one we just saw could even contend with a ten-thousand-man heavy cavalry legion.\"\n\n  Yin Zhu nodded. \"That Viscount fellow was indeed very strong. Are all Dragon Generals that powerful?\"\n\n  Ge'en said, \"He's not even considered one of the powerful ones. No matter the country, the classification of Dragon Cavalry is the same. Ten men form a Dragon Cavalry squad, a hundred men form a company, a thousand men a battalion, and ten thousand a legion. Do you know why, of the eight human nations on the Ryzlevia Continent, only Milan and Landias are called empires, while the other six are kingdoms? It's because Milan and Landias each possess a Dragon Cavalry legion. Relatively speaking, Milan's Dragon Cavalry Legion is the most powerful on the entire continent. It is their existence that keeps the beastmen of the Far North Wasteland from crossing the line. That Austin just now was a Silver Star Dragon General. Below him are Dragon Cavalry squad leaders, and above him are the Gold Star Dragon Generals who command Dragon Cavalry battalions, and the Legion Commander, a Violet Star Dragon General. A Silver Star Dragon General has Cyan-level strength, a Gold Star Dragon General is at least at the initial Blue level, and a Violet Star Dragon General is a Violet-level Grand Battle Master. It's said that a Violet Star Dragon General's mount is a powerful ninth-grade Giant Dragon. Even a Gold Star Dragon General's mount is a true Dragon, not a Trained Drake. Within the Dragon Cavalry Legion, an ordinary Dragon Cavalryman must have at least mid-tier Orange-level strength, possess their own Trained Drake mount, and hold a noble title of Knight or higher. The selection is extremely strict, and their compensation is frighteningly high. Every warrior prides themselves on being able to join the Dragon Cavalry Legion. If I had my current Green-Backed Earth Dragon ten years ago, perhaps I would have tried to join the Dragon Cavalry Legion myself.\"\n\n  \"So that's how it is. Powerful in their own right, plus dragons as mounts—no wonder the Dragon Cavalry Legion is so formidable,\" Yin Zhu thought pensively. It was a pity he was a mage. If he could really ride a Giant Dragon, the feeling must be incredible.\n\n  After that brief disturbance, the Iron Thorn Mercenary Group set off again. In everyone's minds, An Ya's identity had become much more mysterious. No one would treat her as an ordinary employer anymore.\n\n  The rest of the journey went smoothly. Ten days later, the Iron Thorn Mercenary Group finally escorted An Ya and her cargo to Milan City, the capital of the Milan Empire.\n\n  As soon as they entered the city, the cargo escorted by the Iron Thorn Mercenary Group was received by a dozen young men dressed in green. No one knew how An Ya had notified them, but these men were clearly her subordinates.\n\n  \"Yin Zhu, are you sure you won't come to my place for a visit?\" An Ya looked at Yin Zhu with some anticipation.\n\n  Yin Zhu shook his head. \"No, I've already promised Uncle Ge'en I'd help their mercenary group register as D-rank. Anyway, the Milan Magic and Martial Academy is just outside Milan City. If there's a chance in the future, I will definitely come find you. Sister An Ya, thank you for your care along the way, and for teaching me so much.\"\n\n  A trace of faint sadness flickered in An Ya's eyes, which her green-clothed subordinates noted with silent amazement. They had never seen their beautiful boss show such an expression toward any man.\n\n  \"If that's the case, then never mind. Take this. When you have free time in the future, come find me at the Floating Orchid Pavilion in Milan City. I'll be waiting to hear you play the zither.\" As she spoke, An Ya gently slipped a ring carved from blue crystal onto the middle finger of Yin Zhu's left hand.\n\n  \"Ah! Sister An Ya, this is too precious. I... I can't accept it.\" The blue crystal ring was elegant in design with a silver setting of unknown material. A teardrop-shaped sapphire was inlaid upon it, and a soft blue light swirled gently within it like rippling water, without a single flaw. Even more precious was the magical fluctuation coming from it. Yin Zhu knew very well that this was a space ring! The moment the ring was on his hand, his spiritual power had automatically connected with it. He was astonished to discover that the space inside this ring was even larger than his original one. There were even five hundred gold coins inside.\n\n  \"Are you still being so formal with your big sister? This is just a small memento from me. Besides, you'll need it to see me when you come to the Floating Orchid Pavilion. If you don't accept it, I'll get angry.\" Although she was clearly feigning anger, this trick of An Ya's worked on Yin Zhu every time.\n\n  Yin Zhu said helplessly, \"Alright then, I'll accept the ring for now, but I absolutely cannot take your money. Grandpa said a man must never take a woman's money, or he'll become someone who 'eats soft rice'.² I still remember how stern Grandpa looked back then. Sister, please take the money back. This is a matter of principle.\" His voice was a bit loud, causing the people nearby to turn and stare.\n\n  An Ya's pretty face flushed red. Fortunately, her willpower was very strong, and she managed to suppress her emotions. She said in a low voice, \"You little fool, do you even know what 'eating soft rice' means? You're spouting nonsense again. It's not easy for you to be out here all alone. How can you get by without money?\"\n\n  This time, Yin Zhu shook his head firmly. \"Sister, I really can't take it. If you don't take the gold coins back, I won't dare to accept the ring either.\"\n\n  An Ya sighed helplessly. Her right hand swept over Yin Zhu's, and her own ring, identical in style but set with a green gemstone, flashed with light. The five hundred gold coins in Yin Zhu's blue crystal ring vanished. \"You little fool, I have to go now. Be careful this time, and don't lose the ring again, okay? If you run into any trouble, remember to come find your sister.\"\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu stood by the side of the road, watching An Ya's carriage gradually disappear into the distance under the escort of the young men in green. A strange sense of loss welled up inside him, just like when Zi had left.\n\n  The Milan Empire, as the most powerful human nation on the Ryzlevia Continent, bordered the Far North Wasteland to the north, the Ascoli Kingdom to the west, the Floro Kingdom to the east, the Palermo Kingdom to the southwest, and the Pom Kingdom to the southeast. Directly to its south lay the heart of the Ryzlevia Continent—Falan. Bordering four nations and the Far North Wasteland destined it to maintain a strong military. Otherwise, how could it stand firm while surrounded by rivals?\n\n  Milan City, an ancient and civilized metropolis, was home to nearly six million permanent residents. It was the political, cultural, and commercial center of the Milan Empire. As the capital, it was also the empire's foremost strategic city. The standing army numbered three hundred thousand, including three Dragon Cavalry battalions.\n\n  Ge'en and Yin Zhu walked the streets of Milan City, with Ge'en pointing out the surrounding buildings. \"Milan City is known as a paradise for nobles. The architecture here is the crystallized wisdom of the continent's most outstanding craftsmen. Here, as long as you have money, you can buy anything you want. It's filled with all sorts of gold-spending dens. At the same time, Milan City is also the safest city on the Ryzlevia Continent. I ask you, who would dare commit a crime in a city defended by three thousand Dragon Cavalry? This city is enormous. If you were to walk from the north gate to the south, it would take at least three days.\" He had arranged for the members of the Iron Thorn Mercenaries to stay at a cheap inn. After all, he didn't need to bring everyone to upgrade the mercenary group's rank; having Yin Zhu, a Red-rank mage, was more than enough.\n\n***\n¹ A Chinese forum term for featuring or highlighting excellent posts or comments.\n² A Chinese idiom (`吃软饭`, chī ruǎn fàn) for a man who lives off a woman; a freeloader or kept man.",

    "content": "Tonight at 12:05 AM, the Featured Post Convention¹ will be held here. Friends are welcome to attend. Also, Xiao San² will be updating four chapters today; the next two chapters will be released at 8 PM and 12 AM tonight. Please save this to your library and vote for us, hehe.\n\n  ————————————————-\n\n  On both sides of the street, tall buildings of all kinds rose one after another, and pedestrians of every description could be seen everywhere. Ye Yinzhu not only saw warriors but even spotted mages on several occasions. Never mind Arcadia, even in Bopang this was a rare sight you could only hope to stumble upon, which showed just how powerful the nation of Milan was.\n\n  Within the city of Milan, only nobles were permitted to ride magical beasts. Neither Ye Yinzhu nor Ge'en held a noble title, so they had to walk.\n\n  “Look, that's the Mercenary Association Headquarters over there,” Ge'en said, his voice filled with excitement. For mercenaries, the Association Headquarters was their holy land.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu looked in the direction Ge'en was pointing. A tall, magnificent building stood at the end of the street ahead. The massive structure was arched, making it difficult to see its full footprint from the front, but the facade alone was over a hundred meters wide and nearly thirty meters tall. The building was enclosed by a huge wall. At its very center was a giant golden shield emblem with two crossed longswords behind it, glinting dazzlingly in the sunlight and clearly visible even from a great distance.\n\n  Upon coming within five hundred meters of the Mercenary Association Headquarters, the flow of people around them suddenly surged. Mercenaries of all shapes and sizes bustled about endlessly. Ge'en led Yinzhu, and they managed to squeeze their way into the headquarters with great difficulty. Once inside, the pressure from the crowd vanished. At least a hundred staff members dressed in black were maintaining order within the hall.\n\n  It was an extremely spacious grand hall, with a ceiling at least twenty meters high. Bright sunlight streamed in through enormous crystal windows on either side. Aside from the entrance, the other three walls were lined with stone counters. The counters were about two meters high, giving the staff inside a commanding, look-down-from-above perspective. Most mercenaries had to step onto the stone steps in front of the counter to speak with them.\n\n  Ge'en whispered, “Yinzhu, see that? Even though the people maintaining order aren't that strong, no one dares to offend them here. Anyone who dares cause trouble will have their mercenary qualifications revoked immediately. The left side is for accepting missions. This place isn't like the other branch associations; they only have D-rank missions and above. If you're not in a D-rank or higher mercenary group, you aren't even qualified to accept missions here. The right side is for turning in missions and collecting rewards. And the very back is the counter for mercenary and mercenary group registration and upgrades.”\n\n  The counters on the sides were the most crowded, but even the counter at the far end had a long line of people. Ye Yinzhu and Ge'en were heading toward the back to get in line when suddenly, a wave of gasps erupted from the rearmost counter.\n\n  “An S-rank mercenary group! The second S-rank mercenary group has been born…”\n\n  The densely packed lines of mercenaries parted like a receding tide, revealing the counter at the far end. The sudden uproar drew the mercenaries from the side counters over as well, their astonished gazes all fixed on the end of the newly formed pathway.\n\n  A total of three people walked out from the counter; clearly, they had just completed their mercenary group's upgrade. Walking in the middle was a mage in a grey magic robe, who appeared to be in his fifties or sixties. He was tall and thin with an ancient-looking face. His salt-and-pepper hair was neatly combed back. He walked with a light, almost floating gait, and his eyes, filled with an intimidating aura, were hard to look at directly. Most terrifying was the immense fluctuation of magical elements around his body. It was so dense that Ye Yinzhu, also a mage, felt that the magical elements around the man were almost viscous. Anyone his gaze swept over was immediately struck with a powerful sense of suffocation. A purple insignia carved with a whirlwind pattern stood proudly on his left chest, fully displaying his power.\n\n  “An Archmage! A Purple-rank Archmage at that!” Ge'en’s eyes looked as if they were about to pop out of their sockets. As a pinnacle of power on the continent, the appearance of any Archmage would become the focus of everyone’s attention.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu's thoughts were completely different. *So this is the power an elemental mage displays after reaching the Purple rank?* he thought to himself. *You can tell how profound his spiritual power is just from his eyes. Grandpa Qin doesn't have such strong elemental fluctuations, but his spiritual power seems much stronger than this man's.*\n\n  Standing on either side of the Archmage were a young man and a young woman. The young man on the left was about twenty-six or twenty-seven, his body clad in exquisite silver armor that protected everywhere but his joints. He had broad shoulders and a handsome but somewhat cold face. His long, golden hair was draped over his shoulders, and his right hand rested on the hilt of the sword at his waist. What caught Yinzhu's attention most was the violet insignia on his left chest, identical to the one he had seen on the Silver Star Dragon Knight, Austin. To the Archmage's right was a young girl who looked to be only sixteen or seventeen. Her ear-length short hair made her look heroic and dashing. A pale pink magic robe couldn't conceal her fully developed figure. A proud expression adorned her pretty face, and her large, watery-blue eyes glinted with a mischievous light as she smiled, holding onto the Archmage's arm. Most notable was the magic insignia on her left chest—it was yellow. To have reached the Yellow rank at such a young age was absolutely astounding. Yellow rank symbolized a High Mage, and even if she were only at the initial stage, it was still astonishing enough.\n\n  “Uncle, can a mercenary group become S-rank just by having a Purple-rank expert?” Yinzhu asked in a low voice.\n\n  Ge'en said, “A Purple-rank expert is a symbol of an S-rank mercenary group, but it's not the whole story, just like our Iron Thorn group needs your help to raise its rank. An S-rank mercenary group needs at least one Purple-rank expert, but its own strength must also be exceptionally formidable.”\n\n  “Oh. In that case, S-rank mercenary groups are nothing special,” Yinzhu said lightly. Both of his grandfathers were Purple-rank experts, so in his mind, he didn't place them on some unattainable pedestal. After all, in his own Zither Magic cultivation, the Purple Aura Zither Heart, equivalent to the Purple rank, was not the final destination.\n\n  Just as the words left his mouth, Yinzhu’s expression changed slightly. He subconsciously took a step to the side as a faint whoosh of wind skimmed past him. Looking up, his gaze met the furious glare of the young girl standing beside the Archmage. She had clearly overheard him. At that moment, her group of three was passing right by Yinzhu and Ge'en.\n\n  “What are you doing?” Yinzhu said, slightly angered. If he hadn't reacted quickly, he would have been hit by that wind blade. Though it was only an instantly-cast Red-rank spell, it was still enough to tear his clothes.\n\n  The girl raised her head arrogantly. “Didn't you say S-rank mercenary groups are nothing special? I'd love to know what rank *your* mercenary group is. Just a mere Red-rank mage, and you dare to spout such nonsense here.”\n\n  Ye Yinzhu was taken aback. “What do you mean 'spouting nonsense'? I was just stating a fact. What's wrong with being Red-rank? Don't tell me you didn't advance from the Red rank? Everyone's cultivation is a process.”\n\n  “You…” The girl let go of the Archmage’s arm and strode menacingly toward Yinzhu. Wind elements were already beginning to gather around her body, ready to erupt at any moment.\n\n***\n\n¹ **Featured Post Convention (加精大會):** A literal translation of a common term on Chinese web forums. \"加精\" (jia jing) means to mark a thread or post as \"elite\" or \"featured\" by a moderator, highlighting it for quality content.

At the same time, Xiao San¹ will update with four chapters today, with another chapter coming at 12 AM tonight. Please bookmark and vote.\n\n---\n\n\"Alright, girl, don't cause trouble.\" The Grand Magus's deep voice rang out, stopping the young girl. His gaze swept over Yinzhu; it was flat, devoid of joy or sorrow. It paused for a moment, and when he sensed Yinzhu's elegant temperament, he couldn't help but feel a little surprised, especially by Yinzhu's pair of clear, limpid eyes, which left a very deep impression on him.\n\nThe young girl shot Yinzhu a fierce glare. \"Don't let me see you again, or I'll make you look good.\"\n\n\"My mother says I've been very good-looking since I was a child. I don't need to look any better,\" Yinzhu replied quite naturally. To him, this was simply the truth, but to others, it sounded like sarcasm. Instantly, most of the surrounding mercenaries burst out laughing. Not many people dared to offend an S-rank mercenary group; in the eyes of the many mercenaries, Yinzhu, who was only Red-rank, with his noble and elegant bearing, must be a young master from a noble family.\n\nThe young girl turned back to glare at Yinzhu one more time, as if to sear his image into her mind, then let out an angry huff and strode away.\n\nIron Thorn's registration as a D-rank group went very smoothly. Perhaps it had to do with the earlier verbal spat between Yinzhu and the girl, but Ge'en finally became the leader of a mid-tier mercenary group, just as he had wished. To thank Yinzhu for his help, he not only gave him the twenty gold coins he had promised but also personally escorted him to the entrance of the Milan Magic and Martial Academy.\n\n\"Yinzhu, we have to head back. The cost of living in Milan is too high; we can't stay here. You must be careful here on your own. When we have another mission that brings us to Milan, I'll definitely come find you. Also, you are too innocent and kind. No matter what you encounter in the future, you must do your best to protect yourself.\" Ge'en instructed Yinzhu like an elder. The sense of pure innocence about Yinzhu was something he hadn't encountered in many, many years.\n\nYinzhu's eyes reddened slightly. He nodded and said, \"Uncle, take care on your journey. If it weren't for your help this time, I don't know what I would have done.\"\n\nGe'en laughed heartily. \"We'll have chances to meet again. I'm off now. You should hurry and report to the Milan Magic and Martial Academy. Oh, right, from what I can see, that Miss An'ya is definitely no ordinary person. Even a Dragon Knight General had to be polite to her. If you get into any trouble, remember to ask her for help. I can tell she has a good impression of you; she definitely won't refuse.\"\n\nYinzhu watched until Ge'en's back disappeared from view before turning to face his destination.\n\nThe Milan Magic and Martial Academy was adjacent to the East Gate of Milan City. Only by truly coming here could one understand why the highest academy of all human nations on the continent was built in the suburbs of Milan City rather than inside it. The reason was that its grounds were simply too vast. The academy's towering perimeter walls connected seamlessly with the city walls of Milan, stretching almost as far as the eye could see.\n\nOn the way to Milan, Ye Yinzhu had heard from An'ya that the Milan Magic and Martial Academy, also known as the Milan Royal Academy, held an extremely lofty status within the Milan Empire. As the number one academy on the continent, it had cultivated countless talented individuals. All young people took pride in being able to study at the Milan Academy. The Emperor of the Milan Empire was the honorary principal of this academy. Other than the Milan royal family, there was only one way for anyone to enter the academy to study, and that was by passing its tests. Someone once said that the Milan Magic and Martial Academy was a concentration of powerhouses on the Longqinus Continent, second only to Falan. Milan City's East Gate was also the only one of the city's gates that did not require a military defense garrison; the students of the Milan Magic and Martial Academy alone constituted an extremely powerful defense force.\n\nThe academy's tall main gate was a full twenty meters high and nearly fifty meters wide. On the gold-inlaid plaque was carved the insignia of the Milan Empire. Even just standing at the entrance, one could clearly feel a simple and ancient aura wash over them.\n\nPassing through the main gate, a great road wide enough for dozens of horses to ride abreast led straight into the grounds. On both sides of the road, the shade of giant trees blotted out the sky and sun, their lush branches and leaves a testament to the Milan Magic and Martial Academy's long existence.\n\nThe abundance of plant life made the air inside the academy very pleasant. Ye Yinzhu felt as if he had returned to the Jade Sea. Taking a deep breath, this was the first time since leaving home that he had felt such environmental comfort.\n\nThere were many students coming and going. Yinzhu noticed that these students all wore a uniform of alternating red and white, distinguished only by the different emblems on their left chests, which indicated their different fields of study. After a brief observation, Yinzhu figured that those with a magical hexagram emblem were probably mages, those with a longsword and shield emblem were warriors, archers had an exquisite longbow emblem, and so on. Next to these emblems were a varying number of thin red and white lines, though he didn't know what they represented.\n\nOriginally, Yinzhu had planned to ask someone where to register after entering the campus, but he found there was no need. Beside the main road were clear signs pointing the way to the registration area. He didn't know that he had arrived on the very last day of admissions for the Milan Magic and Martial Academy. If he had come as an instructor according to Qin Shang's arrangement, it would have been no problem, but now, without a letter of introduction, becoming a student was not so simple.\n\nFollowing the signs, Yinzhu quickly found the registration area. A row of exquisite buildings stood quietly, each at least several hundred square meters in size. In front of each building, different subjects were written. The subjects were broadly divided into two categories: magic and martial arts, which were then subdivided into many specialties. In front of the very last building, Yinzhu found the three words: Divine Music Master.\n\nInside the several-hundred-square-meter Divine Music Master registration office, there was only one person, and she was fast asleep, slumped over a desk. From her long, flowing hair, he could tell she was female.\n\n\"Hello,\" Yinzhu called out tentatively.\n\n\"Hm?\" The woman lying on the desk lifted her head, looking a bit dazed. A delicate and pretty face appeared before Yinzhu. She looked to be about twenty-six or twenty-seven years old. Her long cyan hair was draped over her shoulders, somewhat disheveled from her nap. Because she was sitting, he couldn't see her figure clearly, but she was definitely a beauty. Having been awakened from her sleep by Yinzhu, she exuded a somewhat lazy yet elegant air.\n\n\"Hello, I'm here to register.\"\n\n\"Oh, for registration. Fill out the form, then.

If you don't pass the entrance exam, the fee is non-refundable.\" As she spoke, she casually took out a form and slapped it down in front of Yinzhu, then tossed a quill pen on top of it.\n\n\"Thank you, teacher,\" Yinzhu replied. The form only had five simple items to fill in: Name, Sex, Age, Cultivation Level, and Birthplace.\n\n\"Ah!\" Just as Yinzhu was about to start writing, the female teacher suddenly let out a sharp cry and shot to her feet, her dark green eyes wide as she stared blankly at Yinzhu.\n\nYinzhu was startled by her and took a few steps back, nearly tripping over a chair beside him. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Are you… are you sure you haven't come to the wrong registration office?\" the female teacher mumbled.\n\nYinzhu glanced back at the \"Divine Music Master\" sign by the door, nodded, and said, \"That's right! This is the registration office for Divine Music Masters.\"\n\nThe female teacher let out an exaggerated cry of surprise. \"Heavens! Could this be the legendary single splash of green among a myriad of flowers?² Our Divine Music Department finally has a male student! This wasn't easy! Quick, fill out the form and pay the fee. The entrance exam for the Divine Music Department should have already started, but there's still time.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Xiao San (小三)*: Literally \"Little Three,\" a nickname for the author, Tang Jia San Shao (唐家三少), whose name includes the character for \"three.\"\n² *a single splash of green among a myriad of flowers (萬花叢中一點綠)*: A Chinese idiom referring to a single man in a group of women, or a single unique thing among a host of common ones.",

    "content": "12:05 PM The \"Featured Content\" meeting will be held as scheduled. Welcome, friends. Please vote and add this book to your collection. Thank you.\n\n——————————————————\n\nAlthough he felt this female teacher was a bit strange, Yin Zhu did as she said, and the number of gold coins on him was instantly halved.\n\n\"Teacher, where is the exam?\"\n\n\"I'll take you there. It's unlikely anyone else will be signing up for Divine Music Magister anyway. The other registration desks have been swamped for days, while I've only had a couple of stray kittens show up. Follow me.\"\n\nStepping out of the registration office, the female teacher stopped. She clasped her hands in front of her chest, crossing her index fingers to draw the shape of a hexagram. After murmuring a few words of a spell, a ray of light burst from her chest, rendering the hexagram her fingers had drawn a distinct orange. With a flash of light, an enormous body appeared before her.\n\nIt was a Horned Horse, but different from the one Yin Zhu had ridden before. This Horned Horse was white and three times the size of the one he'd ridden previously, with a body over five meters long and a height of nearly two meters. The aura it emitted was clearly not that of a first-rank magical beast. The moment it appeared, it obediently lowered its body to let the female teacher mount.\n\n\"Teacher, is this your magical beast?\"\n\n\"Yes. My name is Bì Jī, you can call me Teacher Bì Jī. Get on. It will take a while if we walk. It's faster by horse.\"\n\nYin Zhu didn't stand on ceremony and vaulted onto the horse. Because this white Horned Horse's body was so long, he wouldn't touch Bì Jī in front of him even after mounting. The white Horned Horse stood up and, at Bì Jī's direction, strode forward. Though its speed was great, the ride wasn't very bumpy; it was steady and comfortable.\n\n\"Teacher, are magical beasts allowed inside the academy?\"\n\n\"Of course. The Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy covers an area equivalent to one-fifth of Milan City. If we had to get everywhere on foot, it might be fine for those in the warrior departments, but what about us mages? My Little White is a third-rank Jade Horned Horse. It's quite rare and has excellent stamina.\"\n\n\"Third-rank? Mages can have low-rank magical beasts?\" Yin Zhu looked at Bì Jī in surprise. An Ya had once told him that because of the importance of magical beasts to mages, they would generally wait until their own magic had reached a certain level before choosing one. While warriors also form contracts with magical beasts, they couldn't summon them at will like mages could. However, a warrior's contract with their mount was not as fixed as a mage's, which was a once-in-a-lifetime bond. If a warrior's beast died, they had the chance to sign a new contract after paying a certain price.\n\nBì Jī snorted and said, \"I may be a mage, but I'm only an Orange-rank Divine Music Magister. We Divine Music Magisters don't need to fight; something for transportation is enough. If you're hoping to become powerful, there's still time to change your major.\"\n\n\"No need, I'm choosing Divine Music Magister.\" Yin Zhu fell silent. Through his contact with An Ya and now Teacher Bì Jī, he had come to fully understand the status of Divine Music Magisters on the continent. No wonder so few people chose this profession.\n\nAfter the Jade Horned Horse followed the main road around a few bends, the scenery suddenly opened up. Numerous tall buildings and large open spaces gradually appeared before Yin Zhu's eyes. The number of students increased as well. Bì Jī urged the Jade Horned Horse to a stop in front of a circular building. \"We're here. This is our Divine Music Department's auditorium.\"\n\nBefore Yin Zhu could get a good look at the building, Bì Jī led him inside. The auditorium was not large, capable of seating about five hundred people, but with only forty or so in attendance, it felt quite empty. As Yin Zhu and Bì Jī entered from the back, they could only see the backs of these people. Just as Yin Zhu had guessed, they were all girls. On the desk in front of each girl sat her own musical instrument.\n\nOn the stage at the far end of the auditorium, there was currently only one girl. She sat behind an antique wooden table, upon which rested a guzheng. The girl wore a long white dress and, like Yin Zhu, she had black hair. Because she was looking down to tune the guzheng, her hair completely obscured her face, making it impossible for Yin Zhu to see her features. However, the pair of hands she used to pluck the guzheng fully captured his attention.\n\nThey were a pair of hands as delicate as spring onions, with slender and long fingers. Not even carved white jade could match the fineness and luster of her ten fingers. Each was adorned with an inch-long nail as translucent as crystal. As her fingers lightly plucked the strings, the natural and harmonious movements were elegant and captivating.\n\n\"Find a place to sit. The entrance exam is about to begin,\" Bì Jī said to Yin Zhu.\n\n\"Teacher Bì Jī, what is on the entrance exam?\"\n\nBì Jī smiled faintly. \"Once you've listened to her play a piece, the exam is complete.\" After speaking, she walked over to a corner and sat down by herself.\n\nYin Zhu looked around and his eyes suddenly lit up. He saw a guqin. Without any hesitation, he walked quickly to the girl who owned the guqin and sat down beside her, his eyes now unable to leave the instrument before him. A Jade Rhythm Guqin, this was a Jade Rhythm Guqin!\n\n...\n\n\"Yin Zhu, the guqin is the most ancient of the plucked string instruments, a treasure of traditional culture, and can be called the king of instruments. The five guqins our Qin Sect possesses are all famous instruments of their generation, but that is far from enough, because we do not have a single guqin that can truly be called a divine artifact. If you discover other famous guqins, you must do everything you can to obtain them. Especially the five legendary guqins of lore, for they are existences on par with divine artifacts.\"\n\n\"Grandpa Qin, what famous guqins are there?\"\n\n\"There are many kinds of famous guqins, divided into numerous styles, such as the Divine Dragon style, the Continuous Pearl style, the Shi Kuang style, the Spirit Resonance style, the Phoenix Posture style, and so on...\"\n\n...\n\nQin Shang's words flashed through his mind. The Jade Rhythm Guqin. Although it wasn't a legendary instrument comparable to a divine artifact, it was still a famous guqin on the same level as the Spring Thunder Guqin!\n\nAt this moment, the girl in front of the guqin turned to look at Yin Zhu. When she realized a boy was sitting next to her, her small mouth opened slightly in surprise. She wore a light blue blouse and pants, with matching long hair resting quietly on her shoulders. While she didn't possess the same heart-stopping beauty as An Ya, the gentleness in her features easily gave others a good impression. Her sky-blue eyes, in particular, remained very soft despite her surprise.\n\nJust then, the sound of the guzheng rang out. In that single instant, the entire hall was shaken. Yin Zhu's gaze, which had been fixed on the Jade Rhythm Guqin, was forcibly pulled away.\n\nThe guzheng's shape resembles a guqin, but it is larger and has more strings—twenty-one in total. Its sound is magnificent, resonant, and piercing, and it is easier to control than the guqin. Qin Shang had told Yin Zhu that among the many ancient instruments, the guqin is the emperor and the guzheng is the empress. The guqin is difficult to pair with other instruments, save for the xiao flute, whereas the guzheng can be played in concert or ensemble with any instrument. The guzheng's sound is clearer and more pleasant than the guqin's, with a wider range, but it lacks the guqin's scholarly, profound temperament and its long, lingering resonance.\n\nAt that moment, as the girl on stage began to play, the guzheng's music, like a mountain stream, carried with it an orange glow that captured everyone's spirit. The clear and richly textured notes held a hint of sorrow. Her long, slender, jade-like hands swept across the strings, shimmering in harmony with the orange light released by the music. The sound of the guzheng was like spiritual threads, binding the heart and soul of every person present.\n\n***\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\">Qidian Chinese Network</a> welcomes all readers.

    "content": "Welcome, fellow readers, for collecting and voting. To my friends with monthly tickets, please vote for Sheng Xiao first, thank you.\n\n  —————————————————————————-\n\n  Yin Zhu’s eyes were fixed on the girl in white on the stage, his gaze already somewhat entranced. He muttered to himself, \"A Chinese Ghost Story.\" These words were not a description of the girl on stage, but the name of this zheng piece.\n\n  Her hands moved with extreme speed, yet the fluid, graceful feeling wasn't the least bit jarring. The sound of the zheng was clear and resonant. Although her orange magical power was not enough to cover the entire hall, the beautiful, buzzing notes of the zheng still carried clearly into everyone's ears. The sorrowful and婉轉[1] zheng music swayed the crowd's emotions, and everyone's expression began to rise and fall with the fluctuations of the melody, not even excepting Teacher Bi Ji who had come with Yin Zhu.\n\n  Yin Zhu's gaze grew hazy. Perhaps others had lost themselves in the sorrowful waves of the music, but his heart was already completely immersed in the harmonious plucking and deep meaning of this wonderful zheng piece. Only someone who truly understood could fully comprehend everything within this music.\n\n  \"As clear as splashing jade, as resonant as a dragon's cry. What a magnificent rendition of 'A Chinese Ghost Story'.\"\n\n  As if uncontrollably, Yin Zhu had already moved the Jade Resonance Guqin before him. He did not tune it; his hands had already lightly brushed over the strings. With a gentle pluck from his right thumb, his hands floated over the seven strings with rounded perfection. In that instant, the pure innocence of a child vanished. Although the white robe he wore was somewhat tattered from the long journey, at this very moment, a noble and scholarly aura still rendered his handsome face so perfect.\n\n  The simple, archaic notes of the guqin quietly sounded. Yin Zhu's movements were much slower than the girl's on stage, but every note from the guqin carried a lingering echo, his fingering imperceptibly controlling the tempo—gentle and slow, urgent and heavy—with a recurring, tender intimacy. The clear, long-drawn-out notes of the Jade Resonance Guqin blended with the zheng's melody, adding a certain depth and gravity to the original piece.\n\n  A deep red light radiated along with the guqin's notes, intertwining with the girl in white's orange light from opposite ends, their brilliance reflecting off one another throughout the auditorium. The introduction of the guqin, far from feeling abrupt, was instead perfectly harmonious. The girl in white, who had been focused on her zheng with her head bowed, looked up for the first time.\n\n  Her black hair half-covered her face, revealing only one side. But even that half a face made the strings of Yin Zhu's heart tremble violently. When her pale face and cold, deep black eyes met Yin Zhu's, there was not a hint of surprise, only that the iciness in her eyes dissipated slightly.\n\n  The guqin and the zheng, two instruments that should not harmonize, merged into a perfect whole under Yin Zhu's masterful control, as if it were a miracle bestowed by the heavens.\n\n  The girl in white looked at Yin Zhu, and Yin Zhu looked back at her, yet the strings under their hands did not waver in the slightest. Their gazes met, just like the mingling of deep red and orange. Yin Zhu's hand posture changed, his fingers plucking gently as they embraced the strings. An elegant and low voice rang out amidst the graceful duet of the guqin and zheng.\n\n  \"Life…\n  A dream like a long road\n  Let the wind and frost, the wind and frost remain on my face\n  In this mortal world\n  How many paths can a beautiful dream take\n  In search of a love, a foolish fantasy\n  The road is as vast and lost as those who wander it.\"\n\n  At this moment, it was as if only the two of them existed in the entire auditorium. The guqin has two basic performance methods: one is solo, and the other is *qin ge*, or guqin song.\n\n  The iciness in the white-robed girl's eyes seemed to have melted, leaving only endless sorrow. A voice, slightly hoarse yet as moving as a phoenix's cry, picked up the second half of the verse along with the plucking of the guqin and zheng.\n\n  \"Life is…\n  The extension of a dream\n  In the dream, faintly, faintly there are glimmers of tears\n  Where to go, where to leave from\n  The direction is in your heart and mine\n  The wind sighs softly in the dream\n  The road and the people are vast and lost.\"\n\n  Yin Zhu's hand posture changed again. His right index and middle fingers formed a semicircle, while his left thumb, middle, and ring fingers pressed the strings simultaneously. The sound waves trembled, becoming somewhat softer than before, diluting some of the sorrow in \"A Chinese Ghost Story.\" Accompanied by the harmony of the guqin and zheng, they couldn't help but sing the final verse together.\n\n  \"On the road of the mortal world\n  A happy young man\n  On that rugged, rugged path sees the sunlight\n  In this mortal world\n  How many paths can happiness take\n  Wisps like the wind and rain of a dream\n  The road is as vast and lost as those who wander it\n  Wisps like the wind and rain of a dream\n  The road is as vast and lost as those who wander it.\"\n\n  The seamlessly coordinated singing came to a quiet end, but the notes of the guqin and zheng lingered on. With one final, simultaneous hum, they faded away, leaving behind an endless resonance. Yin Zhu's eyes were as clear as a mirror, while the girl in white's dark eyes now held a touch of bewilderment.\n\n  \"The road, however rugged, is still bathed in sunlight. Big Sister, your zheng music is too sorrowful. Why can't it be a little happier?\" Pressing his hands on the strings, Yin Zhu stood up and said with a smile. The innocent aura of a child returned, diluting his elegance and nobility.\n\n  The girl in white awoke from her bewilderment, wondering to herself, *What's wrong with me? I've never sung the last verse of 'A Chinese Ghost Story' before, yet today I sang it without even realizing. Was it his influence?*\n\n  \"The Wind Startles the Crane's Dance form, the Wind Carries the Light Clouds form, the Luan and Phoenix Harmonize form, and the Fallen Petals Follow the Water form. You used four techniques to complete this piece. But for a guqin to harmonize with a zheng, is that all it takes? Why did you use your music to affect my mood?\" The girl in white's voice was still clear despite its hoarseness, her gaze burning as she stared at Yin Zhu.\n\n  \"Because I understood the sorrow in your zheng music!\" Ye Yin Zhu was a little confused. Why was it that after the song ended, the girl in white's coldness seemed to have intensified?\n\n  \"You understand? Do you really understand?\" With a cold snort, she lifted the zheng from the table with both hands and turned to walk backstage.\n\n  Slowly sitting down, Yin Zhu carefully placed the Jade Resonance Guqin back in front of the girl beside him, a thoughtful look in his eyes.\n\n  *Clang—* A bell chimed, and a faint green light flashed and disappeared within the auditorium. When Yin Zhu looked up, he discovered that an old woman in a long green dress had appeared on stage at some point. She looked to be at least in her sixties or seventies. In her left hand, she held a small, exquisite bell, and the mallet in her right hand had clearly just struck it.\n\n  \"Ah—\" Sounds of people waking from a dream echoed throughout the hall, including the girl beside Yin Zhu and Teacher Bi Ji sitting in the corner. They had been lost in the music since the zheng piece began, and most of them had no idea Yin Zhu had even joined in. For a moment, they were all still in a dream-like state. Only a few of the girls had clearer eyes, revealing a thoughtful expression similar to Yin Zhu's.\n\n  —————————————\n\n  The author specially found a version of \"A Chinese Ghost Story\" played on the zheng. The music is very beautiful. I will try to find a way to upload it online, and I hope everyone will like it too.\n\n***\n[1] 委婉 (wěiwǎn): This word describes something that is tactful, indirect, or euphemistic.

Next, those whose names I call will stay for enrollment registration. The rest of you may leave. You can try again next year.\" The old woman's voice was deep, her emotions indiscernible.\n\nA total of eleven names were called out by the old woman. Those whose names were called showed expressions of joy, while those who weren't left the auditorium with looks of discontent. Yinzhu was also among those whose names weren't called, but he didn't move. He was still pondering the words the girl in white who had played the guzheng had said before she left.\n\n\"You. Stand up and tell me your name.\"\n\n\"Hey, Director Nina is calling you.\" The girl beside Yinzhu, the one with the Jade Rhythm Zither, nudged him gently, startling him out of his thoughts. This girl was one of those who had stayed behind. At this moment, her gaze towards Yinzhu no longer held any surprise, but rather a different sort of feeling.\n\n\"Ah?\" Yinzhu stood up subconsciously. \"I... My name is Ye Yinzhu. Hello, Grandma Nina.\"\n\nSilence. The entire auditorium suddenly fell completely silent.\n\n\"Am I that old?\" The seething, teeth-grinding anger seemed ready to burst through the auditorium. Amidst soft chuckles, the gazes of the eleven girls were completely focused on the young man their age. Who didn't know that Nina, the head of the Divine Music Department, hated people calling her old more than anything?\n\n\"Well... my grandfather said that it's polite to call older women 'Grandma'.\"\n\n\"You...\" Looking at Yinzhu's blank expression, Nina wanted nothing more than to smash the bell in her hand at him, but when she saw his clear, dark eyes, she managed to suppress her inner fury. \"Are you also here to apply for the Divine Music Department?\"\n\nBiji had already walked up to the stage and answered the question for Yinzhu. \"Yes, Director. He just came to register, so I brought him over. You see...\" As she spoke, she gave Yinzhu a deep look. Among those who had been able to clearly hear the duet between Yinzhu and the girl in white, she was arguably the most lucid. As an Orange-ranked Divine Musician, she found it truly unbelievable that the zither skill of the boy below the stage had already reached a level she couldn't hope to match.\n\nNina snorted and said, \"I didn't expect a boy to come study to be a Divine Musician. Fine, you're accepted too. Now you can all go to enrollment registration. Go on.\" After speaking, she left without a backward glance.\n\n\"Wow, a male Divine Musician! There are actually guys who choose this profession? This is so much fun.\" A cry of excitement startled Yinzhu. A petite, short-haired girl of about sixteen or seventeen came bouncing over to his side, looking at him curiously with an expression of disbelief. The other girls who had passed the exam also gathered around.\n\n\"Hey, why did you choose to be a Divine Musician? It seems like no guys are ever willing to choose this 'chicken rib' magic!¹\"\n\nA fragrant scent assailed his nostrils. Yinzhu, who had already learned a thing or two about matters between men and women from An Ya, couldn't help but turn beet red being surrounded by the girls. The sweet scent of maidens lingered at the tip of his nose, and he could clearly feel his heart racing. An unfamiliar feeling made Yinzhu a little anxious. He scratched his head and said, \"Is there something wrong with being a Divine Musician?\"\n\n\"How interesting! A single spot of green among a myriad of flowers. What a cute little shota. I think I saw you playing the zither just now. Do you study the zither?\" the perky girl who had run over first asked excitedly.\n\nYinzhu nodded and said, \"Yes!\"\n\n\"Hi, I play the xiao.\"\n\nYinzhu's eyes lit up. One must know, the xiao was the only instrument that could perfectly accompany the zither. \"That's great! Then I'll have to experience your xiao-playing skills in the future.\"\n\nAfter a brief silence, the surrounding girls burst into raucous laughter.\n\n\"That's hilarious! She said she plays the xiao. You're not going to *play the xiao* for this cute little shota, are you...²\"\n\nYinzhu, completely bewildered, said, \"What's wrong with her playing the xiao for me?\"\n\nThe laughter instantly grew louder. Many of the girls were bent over laughing. They couldn't help but feel a certain fondness for Yinzhu's innocence, thinking that the first male student in the history of the Divine Music Department was really quite amusing.\n\nThe short-haired girl finally realized she had misspoken, and her pretty face flushed red with embarrassment, just like Yinzhu's. \"You guys are awful...\"\n\n\"Alright, girls, stop fooling around. Aren't you afraid of scaring your future classmate? You'll be studying together from now on, so you'll have plenty of opportunities to be together. For now, follow me to register.\" Biji suppressed her laughter, looking at the lively group of girls with a touch of envy. Ten years ago, wasn't she just as carefree as them?\n\nLed by Biji, the twelve new students of the Divine Music Department, including Yinzhu, walked out of the auditorium. Yinzhu walked at the very back, watching the lively girls and feeling very comfortable. He thought to himself, *It seems my future life at the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts should be quite nice!*\n\n\"Hello.\" A gentle and somewhat shy voice sounded beside Yinzhu. It was the girl with the Jade Rhythm Zither who had been sitting next to him earlier. She was about as tall as his chest. Her blue clothes, paired with her gentle, water-like, sky-blue eyes, gave off a soft feeling that reminded Yinzhu of An Ya. It was just that the girl before him was much greener compared to An Ya.\n\nYinzhu quickly said, \"Hello. I borrowed your zither for a moment just now...\"\n\nThe girl hurriedly replied, \"It's alright. You play the zither really well. Oh, and you sing well too.\"\n\n\"You heard it?\" Yinzhu looked at the girl in surprise. Although he hadn't deliberately controlled his emotions and magical power just now, it would be impossible to hear his zither's notes without a certain understanding of zither music coupled with considerable spiritual power.\n\nThe girl nodded. \"Yes! But I only heard the first half. I can't remember what came after. My mind was completely immersed in the harmony of your zither and guzheng. I remember that the zither and guzheng can't be played together in a duet. How did you do it? Can you tell me? Oh, right, your name is Ye Yinzhu, isn't it? My name is Lan Xi.\"\n\nYinzhu said, \"It is true that the zither and guzheng are not easy to play together in a duet. But if it's just a relatively short piece, it can be done with some techniques and different fingerings. It's just very difficult for them to complement each other. One can only serve to enhance the other.\"\n\nLan Xi had a look of sudden realization. \"So that's how it is. But without outstanding technique, it would still be very difficult, I imagine. You play the zither so well, can you teach me in the future? I'm still just a beginner.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled. \"No problem! I can't be your teacher; I'm still far from that level. But you can ask me if you have any questions, as long as it's something I know.\"\n\n\"Thank you, you're such a good person. You didn't even get mad when they were making fun of you like that,\" Lan Xi said softly, her pretty face slightly flushed.\n\nYinzhu gave a wry smile. \"It's not that I wasn't angry, it's just that I didn't quite understand some of the things they were saying.\"\n\nLan Xi stuck out her cute little tongue. \"You were so bold just now! Calling Director Nina 'Grandma'... don't you know she hates it when people say she's old? It's a good thing you play the zither well, or you would have had a hard time getting selected.\"\n\nYinzhu said in surprise, \"Is that so? I had no idea!\"\n\nLan Xi wore an expression of someone who had been utterly defeated by him. \"You can't possibly know nothing, right? Didn't you do any research on the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts before coming for the exam? Don't tell me you know nothing at all about this place.\"\n\nYinzhu nodded earnestly. \"I really don't know anything!\"\n\n***\n¹*Jīlèi*, literally \"chicken ribs\"—something of little value that one is reluctant to discard. The term suggests the profession is seen as rather useless or lackluster.\n\n²In Chinese, *chuī xiāo* (吹簫) literally means \"to play the xiao,\" a vertical bamboo flute. However, it is also modern slang for fellatio. Yinzhu's innocent response is based on the literal meaning.",

Everyone can go listen to it at this address: ｅt/usｅrpagｅ/1/ｍusiｃplay.aspx?id=10870\n\n————————————————————————————-\n\nLan Xi covered her mouth and said, “Praise Falan! So you really are… To think you could pass the exam like that, you really are lucky. It’s a good thing you chose the Divine Music Department. Our department is small, so the elimination rate is relatively lower. The other departments have very high elimination rates. Every year, at least two hundred thousand people apply to Milan Magic and Martial Academy, but the final number of accepted students has never exceeded two thousand. That’s a one percent chance. Milan Magic and Martial Academy is divided into North and South Campuses. The South Campus is the Warrior Campus, where all combat-related majors are located. Our North Campus here is the Magic Campus, for the various mage majors. Regardless of which campus, the teaching areas are in the central part of the academy grounds. The outer areas are the training grounds for each major. Luckily, the paths between the teaching areas are relatively short. Otherwise, we'd have to suffer through long walks to get from one place to another. Today is the last day for registration, so all the majors are gathered together.”\n\nAs she was speaking, Biji had already led the twelve of them to a tall academic building. In front of the building were many temporary stone platforms set up for new student registration and fee collection, with no distinction between majors. Biji waved her hand and said, “Alright, you can go on your own. Classes officially start the day after tomorrow. After you register, you can go rest in your academy-assigned dormitories or go out for a walk, but remember to be careful.” After speaking, she glanced at Yin Zhu, who was among the girls, before summoning her Jade Horned Horse and leaving.\n\n“Praise Falan! Look, the beautiful freshmen from the Divine Music Department are here.” Someone in the crowd shouted.\n\nAlthough Divine Music Mages were an obscure profession at Milan Magic and Martial Academy, one had to admit that nearly all the girls who chose this profession were beauties. Instantly, the eleven beauties became the center of attention. The students from other departments who were registering all turned their gazes toward them.\n\nNo matter where you are, the devastating power of a beautiful woman is immense. The freshmen, who had been standing in orderly lines, suddenly became somewhat chaotic. There was no shortage of people trying to curry favor.\n\n“Come register over here! The beauties of the Divine Music Department never need to wait in line.” Immediately, several registration spots were cleared. Surrounded by the fawning freshmen, the eleven beauties of the Divine Music Department quickly completed their registration.\n\nYin Zhu was lined up behind the beauties, and just as he was about to register, he was stopped.\n\n“Kid, what department are you from? Trying to fish in troubled waters?”¹ Two tall male students directly blocked Ye Yin Zhu, glaring at him.\n\nYin Zhu was taken aback. “I’m also from the Divine Music Department. Why can’t I register?”\n\n“You’re from the Divine Music Department? You could at least think of a better lie. What kind of guy would choose the Divine Music Department?” One of them, a red-haired male student, snorted disdainfully and flexed his enormous fist. Yin Zhu’s handsome face easily aroused jealousy in other male students, especially since he had arrived with a group of beauties.\n\n“Who says our Divine Music Department can’t have male students? I can prove it, he is one of us.” The short-haired beauty who had just finished registering—the one who’d introduced herself as playing the xiao²—had appeared by Yin Zhu's side at some point.\n\n“Huh?”\n\nIn that instant, the entire area fell silent. Whether they were registering or fawning over the Divine Music Department beauties, all eyes focused on Yin Zhu, making him the center of attention.\n\nThe red-haired male student stared blankly at Yin Zhu. “He… he's really from the Divine Music Department?”\n\nThe short-haired beauty said proudly, “That’s right. Would I, Xue Ling, lie?”\n\nThe male student’s expression changed. Suddenly, he darted forward and appeared in front of Yin Zhu. Just as Yin Zhu tensed up, ready to react, the student grabbed his hand, his face filled with excitement.\n\n“My idol! You must be a legend in the world of picking up girls, right? To get close to the beauties of the Divine Music Department, you were willing to self-mutilate and join their department. I’m impressed, truly impressed. Idol, take me as your little brother. You have to teach me your ultimate girl-chasing techniques.”\n\nThe crowd roared with laughter. In an instant, all sorts of gazes—envious, jealous, and disdainful—landed on Yin Zhu. And from that moment on, titles like “the lone green in a sea of flowers,” “the first male of the Divine Music Department,” “the love saint,” and more were all pinned on Yin Zhu, making him the focal point of this year's freshmen, and even a celebrity throughout the entire Milan Magic and Martial Academy.\n\nYin Zhu shook off the other's hand and frowned. “Self-mutilate? Why would I self-mutilate? Has there really never been a male student in the Divine Music Department?”\n\nThe red-haired male student answered without hesitation, “Of course! In the several hundred years since Milan Magic and Martial Academy was founded, you are absolutely the first and only one. Idol, I applaud your spirit of sacrifice. Why didn’t I think of that back then? I’m Fisichella from the Swordsman Department. You have to remember me! Since you’re from the Divine Music Department, go ahead and register.” As he spoke, he thought to himself, *This kid seems pretty naive. If I get on his good side, won’t I have plenty of chances to get close to the Divine Music beauties in the future? He can’t possibly monopolize all of them.* At this thought, the smile at the corner of his lips became a bit more lecherous.\n\nWith Xue Ling vouching for him, no one else tried to stop Yin Zhu.\n\n“One hundred gold coins.” Behind the desk was a teacher with an impartial, iron-like face. His icy voice made it feel like winter had arrived.\n\n“Huh? That’s expensive.” Yin Zhu stared at him, dumbfounded. From the ring Anya had given him, he took out his entire fortune—ten gold coins. “Teacher, this is all I have.” Although he had expected the tuition here to be expensive, he never imagined it would be this outrageous. One hundred gold coins was enough to cover a common family's expenses for several years, yet here it was just the tuition for a single semester.\n\n“If you don’t have money, what are you doing at Milan Magic and Martial Academy? This is just for tuition and lodging. Fees for magical materials and use of the grounds are calculated separately. Since you have no money, just leave.” The teacher waved his hand at Yin Zhu in disgust, as if shooing away a fly.\n\n“I was wondering what kind of impressive person dared to criticize our mercenary group. Turns out, it's just an idiot who can't even afford his tuition.” The crowd that had been lining up parted automatically, and a figure in pink came into view.\n\nYe Yin Zhu recognized this person. It was the magical girl from the S-rank mercenary group he had seen earlier at the Mercenary Guild. At that moment, she was walking step by step toward Ye Yin Zhu, and the students registering all made way for her, clearly recognizing who she was.\n\n“I’m not an idiot,” Yin Zhu said in a low voice.\n\nThe girl snorted. “You come to Milan Magic and Martial Academy without even enough for tuition, and you chose the Divine Music Department on top of that. If you’re not an idiot, what are you? A poor boy like you actually dared to comment on our Violet Mercenary Group. I think you should just get the hell out of here. Milan Magic and Martial Academy doesn't welcome paupers.”\n\n“You…” Yin Zhu glared at her, stepping forward with his left foot. His right fist was already clenched as he suppressed the rage in his heart. “I don’t hit women.”\n\n“Haha…” the girl burst out laughing. “What a joke. You want to hit me? A mere Red-rank mage? If you don’t have money for tuition, then scram. Don't be an eyesore.” Her words were filled with contempt.\n\n“Who says he doesn’t have money for tuition? I’ll pay for him.” An icy, chilling voice rang out from outside the crowd. Once again, a path opened through the people. A slender figure gradually came into view, dressed in a long white skirt and exuding a faint, cold aura. It was the girl in white who had performed a duet with Yin Zhu in the auditorium.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nThis book was first published exclusively on Qidian.com.

Thank you.\n\n---\nHer black hair still obscured the left side of her face. She walked slowly to Yin Zhu's side, tossed a ruby coin onto the table, and said to the teacher in charge of registration, \"This is his tuition fee.\" Ruby coins were rarely circulated; only high-ranking nobles used them. A single ruby coin was equivalent to one hundred gold coins.\n\n\"Hai Yang, it's you. You're opposing me again,\" the young magician said angrily.\n\n\"Luolan, I'm not opposing you. I just can't stand by and watch you bully a new student from our Divine Music Department.\" Hai Yang's voice sounded as cold as ever. But a warmth spread through Yin Zhu's heart, and her somewhat pale face seemed all the more noble.\n\nLuolan pointed at Ye Yin Zhu. \"Fine, you get a pass this time. But if you're a man, I'll see you in the ring at the Freshman Tournament in three days. Otherwise, whenever you see me from now on, you'd better take a detour and get lost.\" She paused, her eyes glinting with sarcasm, and feigned a sudden realization. \"Oh, I forgot. You're from the Divine Music Department. It seems the Divine Music Department never participates in the Freshman Tournament. I suppose that's because you have no offensive power?\"\n\n\"I'll participate.\" The words tumbled out of his mouth. Ye Yin Zhu had directly accepted Luolan's challenge.\n\nHai Yang's brow furrowed slightly. She said in a low voice, \"Don't be impulsive...\"\n\n\"I'll participate,\" Yin Zhu repeated, his gaze firm and resolute. \"I don't know what the Freshman Tournament is, but I accept your challenge.\" At that moment, he remembered what his grandfather had said when he first taught him Bamboo Dou Qi: a person cannot be arrogant, but they must not be without pride. As a successor of the Bamboo Sect, one must have a spine as straight and unbending as bamboo.\n\nLuolan snorted. \"Fine! I'd like to see if you can even make it to the ring to face me. I bet you won't even get past the first match before you're laid up in bed. Or perhaps, you won't even qualify to compete.\" With that, she glanced at Hai Yang beside Ye Yin Zhu, then turned and left as if unwilling to face her.\n\nWatching Luolan's departing figure, a thoughtful light gleamed in Yin Zhu's eyes. In that moment, it seemed he had grown up a little.\n\n\"Are you really going to participate in the Freshman Tournament? That's not something we Divine Musicians take part in!\" Xue Ling said, a little worried.\n\nYe Yin Zhu nodded at Xue Ling. \"Yes, I'm going to participate. My grandfather said that a man must never back down from any challenge.\"\n\nXue Ling looked at Yin Zhu in surprise, something new flickering in her beautiful eyes. She smiled, \"Alright! Then count me in.\"\n\n\"Me too, I'll help you,\" came a timid voice. It was Lan Xi, whom Yin Zhu had just met.\n\nHai Yang's voice was still calm and flat. \"It seems the Freshman Tournament teams are led by a senior from their own department.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu suddenly seemed to remember something and hurriedly said, \"Thank you, but I can't take your money.\" He turned to look for the ruby coin on the table, but the teacher had already put it away.\n\nHai Yang walked slowly away. As she went, she said, \"I'm only lending it to you. You have to pay it back.\" She left, but both she and her zither had left a deep impression on Yin Zhu's mind.\n\n\"Here's your school uniform and dormitory key. Your room is 623 in the Mixed District.\" The teacher in charge of registration stuffed the items into his hand, seeming unwilling to give Yin Zhu so much as a second glance.\n\n\"Room 623 in the Mixed District? Where is that?\" Yin Zhu was at a loss. Beside him, Xue Ling and Lan Xi also shook their heads, indicating they didn't know.\n\n\"I know. I'll take you there,\" Fisichella offered.\n\n\"Thank you, then.\" Ye Yin Zhu was delighted. His mood, which had been soured by Luolan's appearance, completely brightened. In his view, there were more good people than bad at the academy.\n\n\"See you tomorrow, then. Don't be late for class!\" Xue Ling waved enthusiastically at Yin Zhu. Lan Xi was much more reserved, only giving him a small, smiling nod.\n\nThe registration commotion passed, and the new students continued their orderly registration. Fisichella clapped Yin Zhu on the back. \"Let's go. We can run, it'll be faster.\"\n\nThe two of them left the crowd, and Fisichella started jogging ahead. His pace wasn't very fast, but his strides were long, so he moved at a decent speed.\n\nYin Zhu matched his pace and asked, \"Fisichella, where is the Mixed District? Is it far?\"\n\nFisichella laughed. \"The registration teacher probably saw you didn't have much money and assigned you to the Mixed District. Of course, if you were a female student, you'd go straight to the Divine Music Department dormitory. Too bad you're the first male student in the Divine Music Department; they can't have you living with the girls, can they? The Mixed District is also called the work-study student area. That's where they all live. The environment is a bit lacking. Although most students at the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts are nobles, talented students without money can attend on a work-study basis.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu's eyes lit up. \"So that means I can, too.\"\n\nFisichella said, \"Of course, but you have to find the work yourself. By the way, are you really going to participate in the Freshman Tournament?\"\n\nYin Zhu nodded earnestly. \"Yes! But... could you tell me what the Freshman Tournament is?\"\n\nFisichella stumbled, nearly falling over. He was flabbergasted. \"No way. You don't even know what the Freshman Tournament is, and you dared to accept that little witch Luolan's challenge? You really are my idol.\" Though that's what he said, the way he looked at Yin Zhu was as if he were looking at an idiot.\n\nYin Zhu scratched his head, a little embarrassed. \"I'm from Arcadia. I'm not familiar with how things are here.\"\n\nFisichella explained, \"It's like this: every year after enrolling new students, the academy holds a Freshman Tournament to test the overall quality of the newcomers. Students who place high in the competition are very likely to receive special cultivation from the academy. Plus, the top three get prize money.\"\n\n\"That's great!\" Yin Zhu said, pleasantly surprised. Money was what he needed most right now. If nothing else, he had to repay Hai Yang's one hundred gold coins, and he still had future living expenses to cover.\n\nFisichella rolled his eyes. \"Great? You think placing is that easy? The Freshman Tournament is divided by department. Each department sends its strongest team of new students to compete. So first, there are three days of internal selection trials within each department. Then, the four best students are chosen, and along with a senior from the previous year, they form the team for the real Freshman Tournament. Departments are pitted against each other through a lottery draw. On our Warrior side, there are a total of seventeen departments, and on your Magician side, there are nine. Your Divine Music Department isn't even considered a full department, just a minor one affiliated with the Spiritual Department. After the round-robin matches, the top two departments from both the Warrior and Magician divisions enter the finals. After the elimination rounds, the final championship is held to determine the true winner. Almost every student who gets into the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts is an elite. It's extremely difficult to stand out from so many people. In the history of the Milan Academy, the Divine Music Department has never once participated in the Freshman Tournament. The Spiritual Department, on the other hand, is quite popular; their freshmen have made it to the finals for the last three consecutive years. That little witch Luolan from before is the granddaughter of the Violet Family's patriarch. She's a genius Wind Magician who reached the Mid-Yellow Rank at only sixteen, so she's definitely one of the top new students. As for your Divine Music Department, forget about competing—you'd probably have a hard time even finding five people.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Monthly tickets (月票):** A virtual item on Chinese web novel platforms that readers can buy or earn to vote for their favorite novels, boosting their rankings.\n2.  **Sheng Xiao (生肖):** The author's pen name, which means \"Zodiac.\"",

    "content": "To my dear readers, please add this to your collection and vote. Please cast your monthly tickets¹ for *Zodiac* first. Third Young Master is eternally grateful. There will be another update at 8 PM.\n\n---\n\nAlthough it sounded rather complicated, Yin Zhu's memory had always been exceptionally sharp, and he committed the entire process of the tournament to heart. He couldn't help but feel troubled. If he were participating alone, it would be one thing, but now he needed five people. Was being a Divine Music Master really that useless?² Just now, Xue Ling, Lan Xi, and Hai Yang had all been willing to support his participation, but apart from Hai Yang, Xue Ling and Lan Xi's spiritual power was clearly not strong. Besides, they were still one person short. No wonder Roland had looked at him that way; it turned out participating in this freshman tournament was so difficult.\n\nNo, I have to participate no matter what. Even if it's just me, I have to go. Thinking this, he asked, \"Fisichella, what are the rules during the matches? Is it best three out of five?\"\n\nFisichella replied, \"That's an option. There are three formats, chosen after negotiation between the two competing parties. Best three out of five is one. Another is a direct 5-on-5 team battle. As for the last one, starting from the first match, the winning side can continue to compete until they are defeated. If one is skilled enough, they can even take on the opponent's challenges one by one. However, you must defeat all of the opposing team's students to be considered the victor.\"\n\n\"Good, that's for the best.\" Hearing the last format, Ye Yin Zhu's heart settled. This was his affair, so he might as well handle it himself. At worst, he would just defeat his opponents one by one. At this moment, he had not yet realized what kind of strength the opponents he would face would possess.\n\nThe Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy was indeed massive. It took the two of them a full half-hour of running to get from the registration office to the mixed-area dormitories. What surprised Fisichella was that even he was a little out of breath, but Yin Zhu looked as if nothing had happened, his expression unchanged.\n\n\"This is it, Room 623.\" Fisichella pointed to a room in a row of single-story buildings. Sure enough, a sign with \"Room 623\" hung above it.\n\n\"Thank you, Fisichella,\" Yin Zhu said with gratitude.\n\nFisichella chuckled. \"No need for thanks. If you really want to thank me, you have to invite me along if you have any activities with the beauties from your department! Idol.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\" Ye Yin Zhu didn't catch the underlying meaning in Fisichella's words; he just thought he was a good person and agreed subconsciously.\n\nFisichella left. Yin Zhu went to Room 623 alone and opened the door with his key. The moment he stepped into what would be his future dormitory, he saw a small, slender figure bustling about inside.\n\nFor a work-study student's dormitory, this place was pitifully small. Inside the room was a bathroom that could barely squeeze one person in. The so-called living room would be considered full with two people sitting down. As for the bedroom inside, after placing two beds and a desk, there was almost no empty space left. The slender figure was busy cleaning at that moment. His movements were swift. He wore a set of gray clothes that looked simple but were very clean. He was only about as tall as Yin Zhu's chest, and his gray outfit was clearly not tailored, looking a bit baggy. His hands were small but very nimble. Although Room 623 was tiny, he had already cleaned most of it thoroughly.\n\n\"Hello,\" Yin Zhu greeted the slender figure.\n\nHearing someone enter, the person turned around. A handsome but somewhat pale face appeared before Yin Zhu. Long brown hair rested on his shoulders, framing a pair of large, intelligent eyes. However, his small build and unhealthy complexion made him look malnourished. The moment he saw Yin Zhu, he froze completely, not even noticing that the rag in his hand had fallen to the floor.\n\nYin Zhu thought he had startled the other person and quickly said, \"I'm also staying in this dorm. Are we roommates?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" The slender student finally reacted and hurriedly said, \"Yes! The place is small, please come in.\" As he bent down to pick up the rag, a glint of astonishment flashed through his intelligent eyes.\n\nYin Zhu walked into the bedroom. He had no luggage and placed the school uniform he had just received on an empty bed. \"Hello, my name is Ye Yin Zhu.\" As he spoke, he extended his hand toward the slender student.\n\n\"Hello, just call me Su La. Ah! Your hand.\" Su La took Ye Yin Zhu's hand and immediately noticed he only had four fingers.\n\nYin Zhu said nonchalantly, \"It's nothing, I was born this way. Only eight fingers.\" As he spoke, he also held out his other hand and wiggled it in front of Su La.\n\n\"Good thing it's just the pinky finger; it doesn't affect much.\" A slight smile appeared on Su La's face. \"What department are you in?\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu said, \"I'm from the Divine Music Department.\"\n\n\"Divine Music Department? You're a Divine Music Master?\" Su La stared at Yin Zhu, dumbfounded.\n\nYin Zhu gave a wry smile. \"Why is everyone so surprised when they hear I'm from the Divine Music Department?\"\n\nSu La said, amused, \"I think anyone would be surprised to see a male student studying a profession like Divine Music Master. It is, after all, an unconventional profession.\"\n\nYin Zhu smiled. \"You're being kind. They all say Divine Music is a useless magic.² Oh, you're very diligent; you've cleaned the whole dorm. Is there anything else I can help with?\"\n\nSu La quickly waved his hands. \"No, no, I can do it myself. This place is so small. But it was very dirty when I got here. How about this, just give me one silver coin.\"\n\n\"One silver coin?\" Ye Yin Zhu was taken aback.\n\nSu La smiled a little awkwardly. \"Yes! In this world, everything costs money. You see, I spent quite a bit of effort cleaning this place.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu finally understood. Looking at Su La's malnourished appearance, he didn't say much. He took out one-tenth of his entire fortune, a single gold coin, and handed it to Su La. \"This is all I have, no silver coins.\"\n\nSu La snatched the gold coin from Yin Zhu's palm, his gaze filled with fascination and greed. \"A gold coin is even better, of course. How about this, I'll take care of cleaning our dorm from now on. Let's say this counts as three months' wages, how about it? Also, since you're a work-study student too, why don't we cook our own meals in the dorm instead of going to the cafeteria? I'm a great cook. You just have to give me three gold coins a month. It costs at least ten gold coins a month at the academy cafeteria.\" As he spoke, he held up three fingers toward Yin Zhu, looking excited.\n\n\"Oh, alright.\" Ye Yin Zhu took out three more gold coins and handed them to Su La. \"Su La, what's your profession?\"\n\n\"Me? I'm in the Assassin Department, also a rather unconventional department. See, with a build like mine, isn't being an assassin the most suitable?\"\n\n\"An assassin!\" Yin Zhu felt a bit envious of Su La. He had heard from his grandfather that being an assassin was a very difficult profession to master. During training, one never defended, only attacked, relying on special abilities like concealment to achieve their goals. Once they strike, it's either kill the opponent in one blow or be finished themselves. The small and nimble Su La was indeed well-suited for this profession.\n\n\"Does your Assassin Department participate in the freshman tournament?\"\n\nSu La looked at Yin Zhu in surprise. \"Are you kidding? What kind of assassin competes openly on a stage? That's not an assassin anymore. Don't tell me you're planning to participate.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu nodded. \"Yes, I've already decided to.\"\n\n***\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\" target=\"_blank\">Qidian Chinese Network</a> welcomes all readers to visit and read.

Many thanks from Xiao San. There will be another update at 8 PM tonight.*\n\n——————————————————————————-\n\n\"Praise Fa Lan! You don't have a fever, do you?\" Sula reached out and placed his hand on Ye Yinzhu's forehead. His hand was small, but his fingers were long. They felt cool and pleasant against Ye Yinzhu's forehead.\n\n\"You don't think highly of me either? Actually, we Divine Music Magisters aren't completely useless,\" Yinzhu said very seriously. \"Unfortunately, I lost my zither along with my spatial ring on the way here. Otherwise, I could play a piece for you right now.\"\n\nA strange light flashed in Sula's eyes. He sighed regretfully, \"That's a real shame. Alright, you must be hungry. I'll go make some food. You can be the first to taste my cooking, to prove that your three gold coins weren't wasted.\" With that, he quickly darted out.\n\nSula's movements were indeed fast; in just a short while, lunch was ready. There were two dishes and steamed buns. The dishes were just common green vegetables, without even a bit of meat, but Yinzhu was surprised to find that Sula's cooking skills were actually excellent. He had made ordinary vegetables look, smell, and taste perfect. Having grown up eating bamboo shoots, Yinzhu naturally preferred light flavors. He wasn't picky at all and found the meal exceptionally delicious. And so, the Zither Emperor of his generation, Ye Yinzhu, and the Lord of the Night, Sula, ate their first lunch together.\n\nYe Yinzhu didn't know that the news of the Divine Music Department participating in the freshman competition had already spread like wildfire, becoming common knowledge. He had inadvertently become a celebrity throughout the entire Milan Academy of Magic and Combat.\n\nThe next morning, Yinzhu got out of bed very early. Sula was already gone. On the table were a steamed bun and a bowl of congee, clearly a breakfast prepared for him. Although the meal was simple, it made Yinzhu feel very warm. Though Sula was a bit of a penny-pincher, he was very good at both cleaning and cooking. The three gold coins were well spent.\n\nHe stretched his body vigorously. The Bamboo Dou Qi slowly circulated, a comfortable and refreshing sensation spreading through every meridian in his body. His nightly routine of cultivating Dou Qi and meditating simultaneously had long become a habit. Ye Yinzhu touched his right wrist and muttered to himself, \"Good, this wasn't lost.\"\n\nFrom his conversation with Sula yesterday, Ye Yinzhu learned that the red and white vertical stripes on the school uniform had a meaning. A pair of red and white vertical stripes represented a first-year student. The Milan Academy of Magic and Combat had a five-year program. Of course, one had to pass an exam each semester to advance. Otherwise, they would have to repeat the year. Any student who graduated from the Milan Academy of Magic and Combat had to be at least at the high-tier Yellow rank.\n\nThe material of the uniform was quite good. Wearing it, Yinzhu gave off a heroic and dashing impression. The academy was quite accommodating; when the uniforms were handed out yesterday, Yinzhu had also received a campus map. Thankfully, he had it, which allowed him to successfully find the location of his Divine Music Department.\n\nIt took Yinzhu a full hour of running to get from the mixed-district dormitory to the Divine Music Department. He didn't mind, treating it as a warm-up.\n\nThe Divine Music Department was situated in a prime location on the Milan Academy of Magic and Combat campus. A four-story white building stood, elegant and exquisite. To the left of the building was a small lake of about a thousand square meters; the other sides were surrounded by greenery, with only a few small paths leading to the main building from different directions. Behind the main building were the Divine Music Department's dormitories: rows of small, white villas, each one exceptionally quaint. Of course, to live here, one had to pay separate boarding fees. The price was also extremely expensive.\n\n\"Yinzhu, over here!\" Xue Ling was leaning out of a second-floor window and happened to see Ye Yinzhu running over from a distance.\n\nFrom the description on the map in his hand, Yinzhu knew that in this four-story building, the first floor was for spiritual magic instruction, while the remaining three floors were classrooms for students.\n\nThe moment he entered the building, Yinzhu's first impression was that this was a palace, not an academy. The splendid, golden decorations were tastefully accented with numerous plants, so they didn't seem gaudy. It wasn't time for class yet, but the sounds of musical instruments could already be heard intermittently from within the building.\n\n\"What a great place! No wonder it's so expensive,\" Yinzhu muttered to himself.\n\n\"Expensive? Everyone on the continent knows that the Milan Academy of Magic and Combat's tuition is as high as its quality of education.\"\n\nWhen Yinzhu turned his head, he saw that the department head from yesterday, Granny Nina, had appeared beside him at some point.\n\n\"Hello, Granny Ni— oh, no, Director Nina.\" Ye Yinzhu had learned his lesson, correcting himself before Nina could react.\n\nNina huffed. \"Inside the academy, you will watch your words from now on. I heard that yesterday you accepted a challenge from a freshman of the Wind Department to participate in this year's freshman tournament?\"\n\nYinzhu nodded.\n\n\"Are you confident then?\" A sharp glint flashed in Nina's eyes.\n\n\"Yes.\" Yinzhu's simple answer made Nina's eyes widen in surprise.\n\n\"You are? What makes you so confident?\"\n\n\"I'm a Divine Music Magister. I'll rely on my own musical magic, of course.\" Ye Yinzhu looked at Nina with clear, untroubled eyes.\n\nNina lowered her head in thought. \"Alright. In that case, come with me.\" She led Ye Yinzhu directly to the second floor, to the first-year freshmen's classroom.\n\nThe classroom was large, capable of holding forty students, but this year's freshman class, including Ye Yinzhu, only numbered twelve. Everyone had arrived, but the room still felt rather empty. Nina pointed, motioning for Yinzhu to find a seat.\n\nYinzhu unhesitatingly sat down next to Lan Xi, causing her to blush. In truth, it wasn't that he had any particular feelings for Lan Xi; it was mainly because, like him, she studied the zither, and he didn't have one of his own...\n\nNina stood at the podium, her gaze sweeping over the freshmen's faces, and the classroom instantly fell silent.\n\nNina said, \"First, as the Director of the Divine Music Department, I welcome all of you on the department's behalf. Regardless of why you chose the Divine Music Department, now that you are here, I hope you will complete your studies in the academic career ahead. Formal classes will begin in one week. I imagine you all know the reason. It's because the school's annual freshman tournament will be held in three days. For the next three days, the other departments will be selecting their candidates for the competition, but our Divine Music Department is the exception. However, during registration yesterday, student Ye Yinzhu already declared our department's participation. Now, I want to know who is willing to compete alongside him. If we don't have five people, the Divine Music Department won't even be eligible to enter.\"\n\n\"Director Nina, I'm willing.\" Xue Ling was the first to raise her hand. Lan Xi followed, also indicating she would participate.\n\nA faint smile appeared on Nina's aged face. \"Good. We still need two more.\"\n\n\"Director Nina, senior sister Hai Yang said yesterday she would lead us in the competition. We just need one more person.\"\n\nNina looked at Xue Ling, who had spoken, with some surprise. \"Hai Yang is participating too? Alright, then we still need one more.\"\n\nThis time, the classroom fell silent again. Seeing that no one else spoke up, Nina said lightly, \"Our Divine Music Department has always been the number one department at the Milan Academy of Magic and Combat. But, behind that title of 'number one,' who knows how many people call us chicken-rib mages.¹ Since student Ye Yinzhu has proposed participating in the freshman tournament this time, I hope that, win or lose, you will all defend the dignity of the Divine Music Department. On behalf of the Divine Music Department, every student who participates will be gifted a musical instrument and three hundred gold coins.\"\n\n---\n¹ *Chicken-rib (鸡肋, jīlèi) is a Chinese idiom for something that is of little value but a shame to throw away, i.e., useless or worthless.*",

Xiao San is deeply grateful.\n\n---\n\nHearing Nina say this, Yin Zhu couldn't help but be overjoyed. Three hundred gold coins—that would be enough to cover his expenses for a long time, not to mention the musical instruments. However, before he could get too happy, he heard Nina continue, \"Ye Yin Zhu is excluded. As a new student, he got into a conflict with students from another department on his very first day. His participation bonus is revoked as punishment.\"\n\n\"Grandma Nina, please don't,\" Yin Zhu wailed. He had subconsciously touched Nina's reverse scale¹ again.\n\n\"Fine. Then I've decided. If you can't lead the Divine Music Department to a single victory this time, your tuition will be doubled from now on.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Only then did Yin Zhu realize just how terrifying this Grandma Nina was. Adhering to the principle of not letting his mouth get him into any more trouble, he shut his mouth with a miserable look on his face. Xue Ling chuckled softly beside him. \"You look so cute when you're frustrated.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu said helplessly, \"I don't think 'cute' is a word used to describe men.\"\n\nJust then, a girl stood up from a seat at the very back of the classroom. \"Director Nina, I'll participate too.\"\n\nShe was a tall, beautiful girl who looked a little older than Xue Ling and Lan Xi. Her noble air was tinged with arrogance, and beneath her school uniform, her long legs were what drew the most attention.\n\nLan Xi's lowered voice sounded in Yin Zhu's ear. \"Her name is Kong Que. Her instrument is the *pipa*. I think she's high-tier Red rank, a bit stronger than Xue Ling and me.\"\n\n\"Grandma Nina just said our Divine Music Department is the number one department in the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy. That can't be true, right? Don't all the other departments say we're a chicken rib²?\"\n\nLan Xi stifled a laugh and said, \"It's true, but it's about status, not strength. At the Divine Music Department's peak, we once had nine princesses from various kingdoms enrolled at the same time. Naturally, our status was the highest among all the departments. So the 'number one department' title is well-deserved, you see.\"\n\n\"Ah! What about you, then? What's your status?\"\n\nLan Xi said mysteriously, \"You can't ask. The identities of every student in the Divine Music Department are top secret. After all, the relationships between the various kingdoms on the continent aren't exactly harmonious. Here, everyone is just a student.\"\n\nDirector Nina clapped her hands and said, \"For the next few days before classes officially begin, the rest of you are free to do as you please. The four of you, come with me.\"\n\nDirector Nina led them to a Spiritual Magic classroom on the first floor. This was an even larger classroom, with a total of one hundred seats. The walls were made of a special material that facilitated the circulation of music.\n\n\"To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools. I brought you here to pick out some equipment for you. This is the first time the Divine Music Department has participated in the New Student Competition. We absolutely cannot suffer a crushing defeat.\" At this point, Nina seemed a little wistful and let out a sigh. \"Perhaps our Divine Music Department should never have been classified under magic in the first place. Almost every student comes here out of a love for music. Because we lack offensive power, even though we are ostensibly the number one department of the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy, the students and teachers from other departments have always treated us with contempt. Although the incident Ye Yin Zhu started was an accident, I want to use this opportunity to show the other departments that our Divine Music Department is not completely useless. What you carry on your shoulders is the honor of the Divine Music Department.\"\n\nLan Xi said with some hesitation, \"But, Director Nina, can we really win? Our magical music...\"\n\nNina cut her off, saying flatly, \"For the longest time, almost everyone has thought that Divine Music Masters are useless. In fact, they are wrong. A true Divine Music Master is incomparably powerful. They are even the most powerful among Spiritual-type mages. It's only because their cultivation is so difficult that very few people know this secret. On this continent, there was once a Divine Music Master who single-handedly defeated six mages from other departments at the same time. To put it simply, with the exception of Spiritual-type mages, we Divine Music Masters are the bane of almost all other mages. Can any of you tell me, what is the meaning of being a Divine Music Master?\"\n\nKong Que answered, \"To imbue music with spiritual energy, inducing resonance in others.\"\n\nNina said, \"Correct. Through our music, spiritual energy can be released over a wide area. Divine Music Masters, you could say, are the only type of mage whose spells are all area-of-effect. Moreover, music is all-pervasive. It cannot be blocked by any defense, unless one moves outside the range of the sound. As long as we have enough spiritual energy, we can use our music to control our opponents' emotions. At that point, the outcome will no longer be in doubt. At the same level, only Spiritual-type mages have spiritual energy comparable to ours. Mages from other departments don't stand a chance. Ye Yin Zhu, you tell me, what is the weakness of a Divine Music Master?\"\n\n\"It's the time it takes to perform a piece of music. Generally speaking, a Divine Music Master's piece only begins to take effect after the first third has been played. Compared to the incantations and instant-cast spells of other mages, that's far too slow.\" These were the exact words Qin Shang had told him back then, and Yin Zhu remembered them well.\n\nThis time, it was Nina's turn to be surprised. \"One-third? That's not accurate. It should be after the first half is played. Unless one's power has reached the Cyan rank or above.\" How could she have known that as a practitioner of the *Zither Heart of the Pure Child*, Yin Zhu's zither music really did only need to be one-third complete to take effect?\n\n\"In the New Student Competition, the contestants selected from each department are generally between high-tier Red rank and low-tier Yellow rank. And the upperclassman leading the team won't be higher than high-tier Yellow rank. Therefore, as long as you can solve the time problem, with Hai Yang leading you, you have a real chance. Even a mage one or two ranks higher than Hai Yang would have a hard time surpassing her in spiritual energy. Therefore, in the competition, you will need to fight your opponents in a team battle format. The task for the four of you is to hold back the opponents until Hai Yang's music takes effect, preventing them from interfering with her.\" A glint flashed in Nina's eyes; she had clearly thought of this tactic long ago.\n\n\"No, I won't be cannon fodder. As a noble Divine Music Master, I will absolutely not be cannon fodder.\" Kong Que puffed out her proud chest. It had to be admitted that her figure was indeed the best among this year's new students.\n\nNina frowned. \"Do you consider yourself stronger than Hai Yang? Kong Que, if you can't put the team's victory first, then you don't have to participate in this New Student Competition.\" An invisible aura of authority emanated from her, causing the proud Kong Que to falter.\n\nNina walked to the wall behind the lectern, which was painted with a magical hexagram. She stretched out her right hand and pressed it onto the center of the hexagram. A series of deep, rhythmic chants began, but Ye Yin Zhu and the other three couldn't make out what Nina was chanting. A brilliant cyan light erupted from her hand, instantly suffusing the entire hexagram in a cyan hue. This was the mark of at least a mid-rank Magister. To cultivate the art of the Divine Music Master to such a level—one would be hard-pressed to find more than a few on the entire continent.\n\n---\nQidian Chinese Network welcomes all readers.

    "content": "If you find this book to be exciting, please add it to your collection. While you're at it, please cast a few votes for Xiao San.¹ Thank you.\n\n---\n\nAs a melodious tune echoed through the classroom, the hexagram in front of Nina silently split apart, revealing a wide passageway. The passage extended diagonally downwards, and Ye Yinzhu and the other three students followed Nina into this unknown place in astonishment.\n\nOn the ceiling of the passageway, a milky-white magic stone was embedded every ten meters, emitting a soft glow. The air here was very dry and refreshing, with no sense of oppressiveness despite their gradual descent underground.\n\nAfter walking for a hundred meters, a large door carved with ancient, simple patterns blocked their path. Nina stopped and said flatly, \"After you go back, forget everything you saw today.\" A chant similar to the one from before sounded, and a hexagonal gem appeared in her palm at some point. A halo of purple light shone after she embedded the gem into the door. A suffocating wave of magic instantly blossomed, causing the bodies of Ye Yinzhu's group of four to stiffen for a moment.\n\nThe door opened inward, revealing a room of about fifty square meters. Apart from the direction of the door, the other three walls were filled with numerous compartments, which seemed to be one with the walls, though it was unclear what they were made of. The compartments on the left wall held all kinds of musical instruments, their ancient styles betraying their great age. The right wall held magic robes, staffs, and even magic armor and weapons. The wall opposite the door had the most compartments, and they were all filled with gems—magic gems. The immense, almost viscous fluctuation of magical elements emanated from these several hundred gems. This place was practically a small treasury. With the exception of Ye Yinzhu, the three girls—Lan Xi, Xue Ling, and Kong Que—were captivated by the gems on the front wall the moment they entered. Their eyes glittered, and even the haughty Kong Que could not hide the strong enchantment in her beautiful eyes.\n\nYe Yinzhu's gaze, however, was fixed on the left wall, for there he saw a zither—the only zither in the entire treasury of the Department of Divine Music. It had a chestnut-colored lacquer with crackles like flowing water, and a layer of lustrous sheen seemed to emanate an air of proud solitude. Among all the displayed instruments, it sat right in the center, while the others around it were placed far away, like courtiers paying homage to their emperor.\n\nSubconsciously, Ye Yinzhu forgot the presence of the others and walked step by step towards the ancient zither, as if something was pulling at his very heart. As he drew closer, he could clearly see the strings that faintly shimmered with a cyan light and the thirteen pearl markers embedded in the wood, like thirteen miniature bright moons resting harmoniously upon the zither.\n\nSomeone else was also stunned: Nina. Having led the four new students into the treasury of the Department of Divine Music, she had just turned around when she saw Ye Yinzhu's entranced gaze, saw him walking uncontrollably towards that ancient zither. Her heart seemed to freeze at that moment, and an intense pain instantly radiated from its depths to every inch of her skin. Director Nina, who had been so full of authority just moments ago, was now trembling.\n\n*So similar, just so incredibly similar. He's exactly the same as he was when he first came here. The same way he wasn't captivated by the gems, the same discerning eye that fell only upon the zither.*\n\nNina's figure appeared in front of Ye Yinzhu, blocking his view. Having lost sight of the zither, Ye Yinzhu was instantly jolted from his trance. He saw Nina's dazed expression.\n\nA long, purple xiao² appeared in her hand, a faint chill emanating from its body. Nina murmured to herself:\n\n\"The long incense burns away, clouds fly without a trace, and the songbird's cry sounds from slender fingertips.\n\nGazing to the ends of the earth, seeing the ocean moon's pure glow, dyed with longing. It is the unforgettable scenes in my heart, and perhaps, a sorrow that wine cannot wash away.\n\nThe bright moon's condensed jade-like light piles up, and so too does longing unintentionally pile upon my brow and in my heart.\n\nTonight, the xiao remains.\n\nThe Purple Jade Chilling Xiao, a solitary figure standing beside the jade strings and bright pearls. Where are you now?\n\nWhen I become like lonely, dotted starlight, when the ripples recede and the song ends, I will keep watch by the zither beneath the moon. Do you know, I have waited for so, so long…\"\n\n*Wuuuu*—a mournful note from the xiao, tinged with resentment and endless longing, pierced the air, lingering for a long time. A cyan light, with Nina at its center, instantly illuminated the entire treasury. Tears silently streamed down Nina's face.\n\nAt almost the same instant, Lan Xi and the other two girls, who had been mesmerized by the gems' light, all collapsed to the ground, their eyes filled with agony as tears flowed uncontrollably. Their hearts felt as if they were being torn apart by the sorrowful sound of the xiao.\n\nYe Yinzhu was not faring much better. His spiritual power was far too different from Nina's, and he was closest to her, best able to feel the state of her heart at that moment. An unspeakable pain filled his chest, and his face turned deathly pale. Fortunately, the clarity of his Zither Heart of a Pure Child supported him, preventing him from being completely lost in the xiao's melody.\n\nHe bit his tongue sharply, forcing his muddled mind to clear. A pale yellow light enveloped his body. With a single bound, driven by fantastic footwork, Ye Yinzhu's body moved past Nina. A dark red light blazed brightly as all eight of his fingers swept across the seven shimmering cyan strings. A string of clear, resonant notes, carrying a vortex-like echo, took advantage of the brief moment before the next note of the xiao could sound, forcibly cutting it off.\n\nNina's mind cleared, and only then did she realize what she had just done. In her somewhat uncontrolled emotional state, she had actually used a Burst Sound. If she had caused incurable spiritual trauma to these children, it would have been a disaster.\n\nBurst Sound: a sonic wave that erupts in an instant, with extreme penetrative power. It is equivalent to an instant-cast spell for mages of other departments. It is an ability that Divine Music Masters can only use after reaching the Cyan Rank. Yinzhu was still one rank below being able to use Burst Sound.\n\nShe hastily put away the Purple Jade Chilling Xiao in her hand and hurried over to the three girls, releasing a faint wave of spiritual power to check their condition through touch.\n\nBreathing a sigh of relief, Nina's tense expression relaxed considerably. Thankfully, the three girls themselves had a good foundation of spiritual power, and her Burst Sound had been interrupted in time by Ye Yinzhu. Although they had suffered a certain degree of spiritual shock, it wasn't a major problem. They would recover after a short rest.\n\nShe spun around abruptly, her gaze turning sharp. \"Ye Yinzhu, tell me, what is your relationship with Qin Shang?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Yinzhu's spiritual power had only just stabilized after the shock, and he didn't react for a moment.\n\n\"You don't need to hide it. With my Cyan-ranked spiritual power, you couldn't possibly have withstood it with your Red-ranked strength unless you cultivate the same Zither Magic as Qin Shang. No wonder you were unaffected by Hai Yang's zheng music that day and could even play along with her. It turns out you're just like that bastard—your red magic power doesn't represent the third tier, but the ninth tier.\"\n\n\"Grandpa Qin is not a bastard,\" Yinzhu said, slightly angered. By now, he had unknowingly cradled that ancient zither in his arms. The feeling of being connected by blood to the instrument made Ye Yinzhu completely unwilling to put it down.\n\n\"Grandpa Qin? You're his grandson?\" Nina's face instantly turned deathly pale. Her body swayed as if she were about to fall.\n\nYe Yinzhu shook his head. \"No, I am Grandpa Qin's disciple.\"\n\nNina froze, and her complexion improved slightly. \"Did he send you to find me?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu recalled what Qin Shang had said to him when he left the Cerulean Sea. \"Yes! Grandpa Qin asked me to deliver a letter to the Director of the Department of Divine Music. That should be you, right?\"\n\n\"Where's the letter?\" Nina asked urgently, rushing to stand before Ye Yinzhu, her breathing noticeably unsteady.\n\n\"I lost it.\"\n\n\"What? What on earth happened?\"\n\n---\n\nHehe, what kind of treasure will Qin Shang's old flame give Ye Yinzhu? The 8 o'clock update today will reveal all, so look forward to it. He lost his ring, but now he has a zither, hehe. How could Xiao San let Yinzhu go without a zither?\n\n---\n¹Xiao San (小三), meaning \"Little Three,\" is the author's pen name.  \n²Xiao (簫) is a Chinese vertical bamboo flute.",

    "content": "Today's third chapter is here, everyone please add it to your collection and vote! Hehe. The New Student Tournament officially begins tomorrow.\n\n  ————————————————————————————\n\nAt once, Ye Yin Zhu recounted in detail how he had kindly given alms to a beggar, only to have his spatial ring stolen as a result.\n\n\"Bastard. If I find out who that thief is, I'll chop him to pieces.\" In her fury, Nina was no longer watching her words. Recalling the sonic boom she had just released, Ye Yin Zhu was beginning to understand more and more why the other female students were so afraid of her.\n\nAfter a long while, Nina's emotions gradually calmed down. She stared fiercely at Ye Yin Zhu and said, \"After so many years, he doesn't come find me himself, but sends you instead. What does he mean by that? I thought he'd forgotten all about me long ago. Why did he send you here? Was it for this Sea Moon Clear Splendor Zither?\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu shook his head in confusion. \"I don't know either. Grandpa Qin just told me to deliver a letter, he didn't say what for. Maybe it was for me to become a student here.\"\n\n\"What a joke. Can't he teach you himself? With his skill as a Divine Music Magister, does he really need to send you here to learn?\"\n\nNina's expression changed several times, her emotions fluctuating violently. She stared at the Sea Moon Clear Splendor Zither in Yin Zhu's hands for a long time without speaking.\n\n\"Grandma Nina, are you alright?\" Ye Yin Zhu asked tentatively. \"Oh, I'm sorry, Director Nina, I used the wrong form of address again.\"\n\nSurprisingly, Nina didn't fly into a rage this time for being called 'Grandma'. Instead, a faint blush appeared on her aged face. \"From now on, just call me Grandma Nina. Is... is he doing well?\"\n\n\"He's doing very well! It's just that sometimes I see Grandpa Qin spacing out all by himself. But most of the time, he's with me, teaching me how to play the zither.\"\n\n\"Is he married?\" Nina seemed a bit shy as she asked this question.\n\nYe Yin Zhu shook his head. \"I don't know, but for over ten years, Grandpa Qin has always been alone.\"\n\nNina let out a breath as if a heavy burden had been lifted, but then she immediately began gritting her teeth again. \"That bastard. Not married and he still doesn't come find me. Am I really that scary? Bastard, what a complete bastard. Tell me, where is he?\"\n\n\"Grandma Nina, I can't say. When I left, Grandpa Qin specifically instructed me not to tell anyone his whereabouts, no matter who asked.\"\n\nThe anger on Nina's face vanished, replaced by a smile. \"Good boy, Yin Zhu, tell Grandma Nina where your master is! As long as you tell me, Grandma will give you this Sea Moon Clear Splendor Zither. How about it? This is one of the most famous zithers of our time, no worse than the ones you lost. Back then, your master asked me for it, and I didn't even give it to him.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu glanced reluctantly at the Sea Moon Clear Splendor in his arms, took a deep breath, and held the ancient zither out to Nina. \"Then I don't want it. I can't go against Grandpa Qin's words.\"\n\n\"You... you little fool taught by that big bastard.\" Nina angrily snatched the Sea Moon Clear Splendor. Suddenly, a flash of inspiration struck her, and the fury in her eyes instantly disappeared. *Well played, Qin Shang. You won't come find me, will you? Fine! Your disciple is here. If you don't show up, I'll just keep him here. We'll see if you come then.*\n\nOnce she had this thought, Nina's mind became active again. She looked Yin Zhu up and down a few times and asked, \"What level is your Zither Magic at? Don't worry, you can tell me. Your Grandpa Qin and I are old friends; I know almost everything about him. The cultivation levels you practice are different from us ordinary Divine Music Magisters, divided into three parts, each with nine tiers, right?\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu nodded. From Nina's ability to recognize his powers and her entanglement with Qin Shang, he had come to trust this Grandma Nina before him. \"Grandpa Qin said I'm about to enter the initial stage of Sword Gallbladder, Zither Heart.¹ All I need is opportunity and time to break through the bottleneck.\"\n\n*About to break through to the initial stage of Sword Gallbladder, Zither Heart?* Nina was shocked. \"Does that mean you currently possess the cultivation of a Yellow Rank, high-tier Divine Music Magister?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"Haha, hahaha! This is wonderful, truly wonderful! How can I let go of such a great opportunity sent to me by the heavens? Hmph, you old fogeys from the other departments, this time I'll show you what a true Divine Music Magister is. The New Student Tournament will tremble because of our Divine Music Department! Here, take it.\" As she spoke, she placed the Sea Moon Clear Splendor back into Ye Yin Zhu's hands.\n\n\"How much of your Grandpa Qin's skill have you learned?\" Nina asked.\n\n\"I don't know. Grandpa Qin says I'm still far from it. Grandma Nina, your emotional fluctuations are too great. For a Divine Music Magister, that's not a good thing, is it?\"\n\nNina snorted. \"You don't need to worry about my affairs. How ridiculous! That little girl from the Wind Department actually challenged you yesterday. Little does she know that you're the real genius. A sixteen- or seventeen-year-old who has reached the high tier of the Yellow Rank is equally outstanding on the dueling stage. Ye Yin Zhu, you listen to me. No matter what, you must lead the Divine Music Department to a good result in this New Student Tournament. If you can make it to the finals, then, as the Director of the Divine Music Department, I will request a scholarship for you, exempting you from all future tuition fees, and I'll let you use this Sea Moon Clear Splendor Zither indefinitely.\"\n\n\"Really? That's great!\" Ye Yin Zhu was overjoyed. The two things he lacked most right now were money and a zither, and now he had both.\n\nNina shot him a glare. \"Don't think it'll be easy. Don't forget, Divine Music Magisters have very little offensive capability. We'll stick to the plan I just laid out, but the main attacker will be changed from Hai Yang to you.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu shook his head. \"No, that's not right. I can't use a girl as my shield. Grandma Nina, I think I can do it on my own.\"\n\n\"Good, you have ambition. You're worthy of being Qin Shang's disciple. However, you will listen to me here. With you as a variable, I need to rethink our strategy for the tournament. We'll talk about it later. Oh, right, don't let anyone else know that your Zither Magic is different from that of an ordinary Divine Music Magister. The more others underestimate you, the better.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay,\" Yin Zhu agreed.\n\nNina sighed. \"If you run into any trouble at the academy from now on, come find me. Since your master entrusted you to me, I'll take good care of you. Come, follow me.\" She led Ye Yin Zhu to a shelf on the right side of the treasury and took a set of white magic robes from the top shelf, stuffing them into his arms. Then she brought him to the shelf with the gems and took out a bracelet and a necklace for him.\n\n\"You can go now. I still need to pick out some equipment for these girls. Don't lose these three items I've given you. The magic robe is called the Moon God's Guardian Robe, a magical item produced by the Elven race. It comes with a built-in Elemental Light Shield skill and an attached self-cleansing water-element magic, so it will never be stained by any dirt. The Elemental Light Shield can be released in different ranges depending on the user's spiritual power and can be used three times a day. It has decent resistance against both physical and magical attacks.\"\n\n\"Grandma Nina, this is too valuable.\" From the elemental fluctuations radiating from these three items, Ye Yin Zhu could tell they were rare treasures.\n\n\"It's not a gift for you. It's just so you can contribute to the Divine Music Department in the New Student Tournament. The necklace is called Spiritual Protection; it's specifically for guarding your spiritual power and will be beneficial for your daily cultivation. If you encounter a spiritual magic attack, it can also protect the source of your spirit so you don't become an idiot. That Life Guardian Bracelet can summon an Absolute Defense once per day. Although it's an Absolute Defense, if your opponent's attack exceeds the Purple Rank, it will still be very dangerous. Go back and figure it out for yourself.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu left as Nina instructed. Watching his retreating figure, tears welled up in Nina's eyes again. \"You big bastard, the God's Guardian Three-Piece Set that you didn't want back then, I've given it to your disciple. Did you know? Back then, this was the love token I had prepared to give you...\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Sword Gallbladder, Zither Heart (劍膽琴心):** A Chinese idiom and, in this context, a cultivation realm. \"Sword Gallbladder\" implies the courage and decisiveness of a swordsman, while \"Zither Heart\" implies the refined and focused mind of a zither master.

And for those friends with VIP tickets, please smash them for Shengxiao,¹ let him make the charts one last time as it comes to an end. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nNight fell. Sitting in front of a bamboo house by the Jade-Green Sea, Qin Shang's figure appeared somewhat desolate, a guqin lying on the table before him.\n\n\"Yin Zhu should have arrived in Milan by now. Have you seen him? Oh, Nina, Nina, do you know how much I want to see you? But I cannot. I carry too many burdens on my shoulders.\n\nThe flowing water, leisurely under the sky,\nEnters the ear, clear with the night.\nUnder exquisite understanding,\nA single string sounds without words.\n\nThe clear, cool melody becomes a verse of poetry,\nTelling you its tale, for you to listen closely.\n\nA heart's desire, that fate won't let the qin and xiao miss each other in this life,\nLeaving behind the most beautiful musical destiny, right here.\n\nArriving gracefully, holding the qin you love,\nTonight you are even more elegant and beautiful.\n\nUnder the clear moonlight stretching a thousand li,\nCherishing this moment with the moon.\n\nI play a tune to send to you from afar, earnest and sincere,\nWithin it, my heart remains steadfast.\"\n\nThe guqin's notes sang, a teardrop fell. Although it wasn't the Sea-Moon's Pure Brilliance Guqin, at this very moment, as Qin Shang's hands pressed upon the strings, his thoughts were already immersed in distant memories.\n\n...\n\nYin Zhu wasn't wearing the Moon God's Ward, but he had the Mind Ward and the Life Ward on him. Although Nina had been very fierce today when she learned he was Grandpa Qin's disciple, besides her deep sorrow, he also clearly felt Grandma Nina's longing for Grandpa Qin. Nina gave him the feeling of family.\n\nThe Mind Ward was a silver necklace forged from an unknown metal. A heart-shaped silver gem was embedded in the pendant, and when Ye Yin Zhu put it on, the gem attached itself to his chest. A peculiar elemental fluctuation merged completely with his spiritual power. His mind seemed to become clearer, and his spiritual power was compressed and solidified by the formless elemental energy.\n\nThe Life Ward was about an inch wide and fit snugly on his wrist. It had a total of eight pale green gems embedded in a cyan metal. A gentle energy connected with the pulse of his heart, creating a warm sensation. All three magic items were related to defense, and even though Yin Zhu was unfamiliar with such things, he could feel how valuable they were.\n\n\"Hey, you've been sitting there like a fool for half the day. Not sleeping, not meditating, what are you thinking about?\" Sula asked curiously, lying on his own bed.\n\n\"Ah!\" Yin Zhu was startled from his thoughts. \"It's nothing. The Freshman Grand Competition starts in two days.\"\n\nSula let out a chuckle, his large eyes still bright in the night. \"You're really going to participate? Don't get your hopes up; your Divine Music Department doesn't stand a chance. Get some rest. I think you'd be better off thinking about your own future.\"\n\nTwo days passed quickly. Every day when Ye Yin Zhu arrived at the Divine Music Department, Nina would gather the five of them who were competing to plan tactics for the upcoming matches. She seemed to have forgotten what happened that day and paid no more special attention to Ye Yin Zhu. It was just that beneath her stern exterior, her gaze would occasionally reveal a hint of gentleness.\n\nA golden sun shone upon the earth. The Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts was filled with vibrant life, and plants of all shapes and sizes released the freshest air under the sunlight. Although it was near the northern end of the continent, the temperature was still quite comfortable because it was summer.\n\nBesides the central district, more than two-thirds of the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts was composed of training grounds for the various departments. After all, both magic and martial arts required ample space for practice. Today, the training grounds of every department were especially lively, because the Freshman Grand Competition was being held in more than a dozen of the main ones.\n\nA large number of freshmen and students from other years had all gathered around the major training grounds where matches were being held. The most popular of all was Training Ground Number Six, where the Divine Music Department and the Water Department were competing today.\n\nThe Divine Music Department's training ground was the same auditorium where the new students had taken their tests, which was obviously unsuitable for a competition. So, after the competition order was decided by drawing lots, they had no choice but to compete at the Water Department's training ground.\n\nTraining Ground Number Six was a full thousand square meters in area. Magic from any department required a certain amount of space to be cast, so this wasn't considered very large. Normally, this being the Water Department's training ground, students from the Water Department would make up the largest portion of the audience. But at this moment, the entire area around Training Ground Number Six was surrounded by at least six thousand people, more than ten times the number of students in the entire Water Department. The reason was simple: since the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts was founded, this was the first time the freshmen of the Divine Music Department had ever participated. The noble beauties of the Divine Music Department had an extremely high reputation in Milan. One must know that the vast majority of those who chose to become Divine Magisters came from the highest nobility, as only they didn't need to worry about their future livelihoods. Who could say that this year's freshmen didn't include princesses from the various nations of the Longqinus Continent?\n\n\"Divine Music! Divine Music! Divine Music!\" High-pitched cheers rose and fell like a tide. Even some of the Water Department students were cheering for the Divine Music Department. No one thought the Divine Music Department could win, but seeing their many beauties was the desire of every male student. If, by some chance, they could leave a good impression on the beautiful girls, it would be a heavenly blessing.\n\nThere were twenty seats on the viewing platform of Training Ground Number Six, a place where Water Department teachers usually watched their students practice. But now, it had become the viewing area for the teachers of both the Water and Divine Music Departments. Director Nina sat in the central seat, and beside her sat the Water Department Director, a mid-tier Blue-rank Magister named Vagram. The other teachers from both departments sat on either side. Fortunately, most of the teachers in the Water Department were female, so the beautiful teachers of the Divine Music Department were not harassed in any way. After all, the beauty of the Divine Music Department's teachers was as famous as that of their students.\n\n\"Director Nina, I originally thought the rumors of your Divine Music Department participating were just that—rumors. I didn't expect it to be true.\" Vagram was a scrawny little old man, and he looked at Nina with a half-smiling expression.\n\nNina didn't even spare him a glance, her eyes fixed on the students from both sides who had already entered the training ground. She replied faintly, \"Since our Divine Music Department is the foremost department in the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts, why shouldn't we participate? You should worry about how to keep your Water Department from finishing last in the Freshman Grand Competition yet again.\"\n\n\"You...\" Vagram was greatly embarrassed. Water magic had always been a relatively weak type of magic. For healing, it was inferior to the Light Department, and its offensive spells only truly became powerful at the Green rank or higher. Thus, they usually ended up in last place in previous Freshman Grand Competitions. Furthermore, most who chose the Water Department were students of average means; among magicians, the Water Department had the most work-study students. This meant the students lacked the financial resources to purchase high-level magic items.\n\n\"Since this is a test competition for all freshmen, it is of course normal for the Divine Music Department to participate,\" a wizened voice sounded behind them. Nina and Vagram turned around in surprise at the same time, only then realizing that an old man dressed in pale gold magic robes had appeared behind them at some point.\n\nEven the ever-proud Nina immediately stood up upon seeing this person and said respectfully, \"Dean Ferguson, hello.\"\n\nVagram said in surprise, \"Dean Ferguson, what brings you here?\"\n\nFerguson smiled slightly, the wrinkles on his face deep enough to hold any kind of bean. \"With the Divine Music Department taking the field, I naturally had to come and show my support for Director Nina. I imagine there must be some outstanding students among this year's Divine Music freshmen.\" He understood Nina far better than Vagram did. Nina's pride was famous throughout the entire Milan Empire. If she wasn't certain of her chances, the non-combative Divine Music Department would not be standing on the training ground today.\n\n***\n**Translator's Notes:**\n1.  **Shengxiao (生肖):** The Chinese Zodiac.

Thank you.\n\n——————————————————————————\n\nWaglei gave his seat to Ferguson. Ferguson waved to the teachers from both departments who stood to greet him. \"Everyone, please be seated. The match is about to begin.\"\n\nOn the spacious Training Field, spanning over a thousand square meters, the ten competing students from the Divine Music and Water Departments were now in the center of the arena. Hai Yang, her face still half-hidden by her black hair, stood at the very back, not drawing much attention. Lan Xi, Xue Ling, and Kong Que were all rare beauties, naturally drawing the eyes of the thousands of students watching from the stands. But the true center of everyone's focus was not them, but Ye Yinzhu, who stood in the very center of the five contestants from the Divine Music Department.\n\nThe pristine white Moon God Robe was spotless. The collar, cuffs, and other parts of the robe were trimmed with gold edges. On his left breast was a crescent-moon-shaped gem, white as a jewel, emitting a soft glow. It filled the simply adorned robe with an air of nobility and elegance.\n\nHis long black hair rested softly on his shoulders, and an elegant aura graced his handsome face. Dressed in the Moon God Robe and standing on the Training Field, Ye Yinzhu seemed like a different person. His every move was filled with a noble bearing. His elegance was pure, unadulterated, especially his deep, clear black eyes, which seemed capable of seeing into the very depths of a person's soul. His posture was perfectly straight, and his tall, slender frame made the four girls beside him seem like his finest ornaments.\n\nStanding in the central position represented being the captain of one's department. No one had expected that the captain of the Divine Music Department would not be the second-year student Hai Yang, but Ye Yinzhu, the one who had accepted the challenge of the genius wind-element girl, Luolan.\n\nThe five representatives from the Water Department consisted of two boys and three girls. The looks of the three female students were rather plain compared to those from the Divine Music Department. Right now, their gazes were completely captivated by the elegant Yinzhu before them; one could almost see the pink sparkles in their eyes. Just as men like beautiful women, women also like handsome men.\n\n\"Greetings. I am Kalachi, a second-year student from the Water Department and the captain for this freshman tournament. Please advise me.\" Looking at the Divine Music contestants before him, Kalachi felt a pang of jealousy. It was one thing for the Divine Music Department to produce beauties, but for the first male student they've had in years to be this handsome—he had completely stolen his spotlight. *Hmph, I'll show you what I'm made of in a bit.*\n\nKalachi was half a head shorter than Ye Yinzhu. Although he was also good-looking, he had a common ailment among mages: a pale complexion. Compared to Ye Yinzhu's sunny elegance, he was clearly not in the same league.\n\nYe Yinzhu nodded in return. \"Hello. I am the captain of the Divine Music Department, first-year Ye Yinzhu. Please advise me.\"\n\nKalachi suppressed the jealousy in his heart and smiled. \"I wonder which match format your esteemed department will choose?\" According to the freshman tournament rules, out of respect for women, the side with more female contestants had the right to choose the match format. If the number of female students was equal, the choice would be decided by a draw. Needless to say, among the combat and magic departments, the Divine Music Department was the only one capable of fielding four female students. This was one of their advantages.\n\n\"Team battle,\" Ye Yinzhu's reply was concise and firm.\n\nKalachi acknowledged, and both sides retreated. A teacher from the academy's Academic Affairs Office served as the referee for this match. After confirming the match format, he loudly announced the start of the competition.\n\nSix points around training field number six lit up simultaneously, and a massive magic hexagram appeared in mid-air. A faint, milky-white light formed a huge, transparent dome, enveloping the entire Training Field. To use high-grade magic stones to create the Training Field's defensive barrier was something perhaps only the deep-pocketed Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts could afford. This type of element-infused defensive shield could withstand the bombardment of any magic below the Blue Rank and could be sustained as long as the mages maintaining it had enough energy.\n\nA wooden table, a wooden chair. Hai Yang sat down in their backfield, her guzheng already laid flat on the table. The other four, led by Ye Yinzhu, stood five meters in front of her, forming an arc that subtly shielded Hai Yang behind them.\n\n\"Ye Yinzhu, we're starting!\" Kalachi shouted from the other side. He was in no hurry to attack. They knew a little about Divine Musicians; as long as a musical piece couldn't reach its halfway point, its power wouldn't manifest. With that much time, even the incantation for a Water Department forbidden spell could be completed.\n\nKalachi's answer was the clang of a zither, powerful and resounding, trembling like a dragon's roar. Hai Yang's performance had begun.\n\nOrange light, accompanied by a melody as clear as splashing jade,¹ spread out in ripples. The name of this zither piece was \"Dream.\" A gentle and sorrowful mood accompanied the melody, as if expressing Hai Yang's own feelings.\n\nA sharp glint flashed in Kalachi's eyes. \"Good, high-tier Orange Rank. Truly the number one genius of the Divine Music Department. What a pity...\"\n\nYe Yinzhu didn't know what Kalachi meant by \"pity.\" By now, the opponent's attack had already begun. The four students chosen from a hundred first-years were naturally the cream of the crop. Varying shades of orange light burst from their bodies almost simultaneously, all of them at the level of Intermediate Mages. The low drone of incantations began as they started their spells.\n\nKalachi did not chant. The light he released was a faint yellow—low-tier Yellow Rank. An instantly cast red Water Arrow shot straight for Ye Yinzhu's chest. As captain, Kalachi started with a probing attack. Having reached the Yellow Rank, he could instantly cast Red-rank magic.\n\nNina's only instruction for the first match was four words: *win by surprise.* The Divine Music Department had never appeared in an intra-academy competition before. No one was familiar with Divine Musicians, and that was their greatest advantage.\n\nYe Yinzhu took a step to his left. The Water Arrow was fast, but his seemingly casual movement was just enough to evade it. The red Water Arrow struck the Training Field's defensive barrier, creating a faint ripple.\n\nKalachi was stunned. In a duel between mages, dodging was a rare sight. He never imagined Ye Yinzhu would deal with his attack in such a way. Just then, he realized something was wrong. According to their plan, his four teammates should have already released their first wave of spells, but their incantations still weren't finished. Why? *It's the zither music.* The sudden realization made Kalachi's expression turn grim. He abruptly discovered that Divine Musicians were not entirely useless; Hai Yang's zither music was already taking effect.\n\nHe had to stop her. It wasn't often that the Divine Music Department appeared as a potential candidate to replace the Water Department at the bottom of the rankings, and he wasn't willing to let this opportunity go. He fired one instant Water Arrow after another at Ye Yinzhu's group of four, some even aimed at the gaps between them, targeting Hai Yang. Kalachi thought that as long as he interrupted the music, victory would be theirs.\n\nKong Que snorted in disdain. \"So this is all he's got!\" With a wave of her right hand, a ring on her middle finger released a powerful elemental glow. An orange-colored shield instantly expanded, blocking the space in front of the four of them. Red-rank Water Arrows against an Orange-rank defense were completely blocked, creating a series of dense impacts.\n\nAt that moment, the other four students from the Water Department finally completed their spells. Water's Roar, a tidal wave-type spell. If cast by a single Orange-rank mage, its power would be limited, but when launched by four mages simultaneously, it was formidable. The four-layered orange tidal wave surged toward the Divine Music Department's side with a powerful roar.\n\nKalachi raised his magic staff. A brilliant blue gem on its head emitted a soft halo of light as his chanting began. Someone in the crowd cried out, \"Water Sprite's Blessing.\"\n\n***\n**Translator's Notes:**\n1.  **Clear as splashing jade (清如濺玉):** A Chinese idiom used to describe a sound that is crisp, clear, and pleasant, like the tinkling sound of jade pieces clinking together or water splashing on them.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\" target=\"_blank\">Qidian.com</a> welcomes all book lovers to visit and read.

    "content": "Here is the third chapter for today. To my brothers, please add this to your collections and vote. Hehe.\n\n————————————————————————-\n\nA single layer of Orange-rank defense was naturally not enough to block four Water Roars. Lan Xi and Xue Ling simultaneously extended their right hands, releasing the same kind of orange light shield as Kong Que, forming a triple-layered defense.\n\nWhen the Water Roars collided with the triple-layered defense, a whirlwind of orange magical elements instantly erupted in the trial arena. The defensive shields were already struggling to hold.\n\nIn the stands, Wagere snorted with disdain. \"Can magic items really block magic completely? Even with powerful magic items, a mage can only exert power one rank higher than their own. Karachi's Water Sprite's Blessing Magic Staff can reduce the casting time for water-type magic by thirty percent. How can the little brats from the Divine Music Department possibly block this?\"\n\nNina gave a cold laugh. \"Then just you watch. You poor devils of the Water Department will never know what true magic items are.\" She was naturally aware that the Water Sprite's Blessing was Wagere's own magic staff, which he had lent to Karachi for this match. Wagere had already played his ace, but Nina wasn't the least bit worried. When it came to wealth, no department could compare to the Divine Music Department, which often had princesses as students. Their reputation as the number one department wasn't for nothing.\n\nAs the power of the fourfold Water Roar dissipated, the three orange magic defense shields vanished simultaneously. Magic items also required a certain amount of mental energy to support, and Xue Ling and Lan Xi, who were only at the initial stage of the Crimson rank, already looked a little pale.\n\nTaking advantage of the Water Roar's interference with the zither music and the effect of the Water Sprite's Blessing, Karachi's spell was completed just in time, linking up with his companions' magic. A water dragon about three meters long roared out, shimmering with a yellow light as it lunged toward the Divine Music Department's side. After completing this spell, Karachi's face looked even paler. The influence of the zither music was growing stronger, and he had no choice but to unleash his most powerful spell, the Water Dragon's Chant.\n\nA wave of gasps came from the crowd watching below the stage. They could all see that even if the students from the Divine Music Department could conjure their previous magic shields again, it would be impossible to block a Yellow-rank magic attack. The outcome of the match seemed to be decided.\n\nJust at that moment, Ye Yin Zhu smiled calmly as he and the three girls retreated to Hai Yang's side. A milky-white light was released from the Moon God's Guard on his body, instantly expanding to a ten-meter radius and enveloping all five of them.\n\n*Boom—* The power of the Water Dragon's Chant was indeed impressive. However, after the initial impact, the gasps from the crowd changed in tone. The three-meter-long yellow water dragon shattered into pieces, while the milky-white barrier only showed some fine cracks.\n\n\"Impossible.\" Wagere's eyes widened as he shot up from his seat in the stands. The magic light released from Ye Yin Zhu's body was clearly Crimson-rank!\n\nFerguson gave Nina a meaningful look. \"The Moon God's Guard. Even I have to envy the Divine Music Department.\"\n\nThe piece *Dream* was halfway through, and there was no longer any suspense. Neither Karachi nor his companions could cast another spell. His four junior schoolmates had already fallen into a deep slumber under the influence of *Dream*. Karachi, too, was drowsy and could no longer chant a single syllable of a spell. *Dream*, of course, did not affect Yin Zhu and his group; selective attacks were a special skill of all Divine Music Masters.\n\n\"All students of the Water Department have lost the ability to resist. The Divine Music Department wins.\" The referee delivered the precise judgment. Even if mages were poor at physical combat, throwing sleeping people off the stage was still entirely possible.\n\n\"Yeah— we won, we really won!\" Xue Ling jumped up in excitement. She threw her arms around Ye Yin Zhu's neck and gave him an enthusiastic kiss on the cheek, making him blush and leaving him awkwardly unsure of what to do.\n\nLan Xi was much more reserved, a gentle smile gracing her face.\n\nKong Que proudly puffed out her full chest and declared, \"The Divine Music Department is the strongest.\"\n\nHai Yang's reaction was the most placid. As *Dream* ended, she picked up her guzheng and headed out of the trial arena.\n\nThe entire venue was dead silent.\n\nBefore the match began, absolutely no one thought the Divine Music Department would win. In the past, matches between mages involved both sides blasting each other with magic until one side's magical power was depleted and they lost. It was a contest of pure strength. But today's match had ended far too quickly. The Water Department students had only managed to release a single offensive spell before being defeated by the Divine Music Department. At this moment, many students began to question the Divine Music Department's reputation as a \"useless\" major.\n\nWagere stood there, somewhat dazed. \"Impossible, this is impossible. Even with the Moon God's Guard, a Crimson-rank student couldn't possibly block the Water Dragon's Chant.\" He had thought that with the Divine Music Department participating, his Water Department wouldn't have to be last place, but now his mood had hit rock bottom.\n\nNina stood up, her head held high with pride. \"Old man Wagere, remember my words. This is only the beginning.\"\n\nWagere let out an angry snort and, without another word, turned and left with the Water Department's teachers. Having lost to the Divine Music Department, he had no face to stay here any longer.\n\nFerguson smiled faintly. \"Water magic is actually quite good, but unfortunately, low-level water spells lack power. Dean Nina, that captain of your Divine Music Department, Ye Yin Zhu, is very interesting.\" He agreed with one point Wagere had made: even with the Moon God's Guard, a Crimson-rank mage shouldn't be able to block a Yellow-rank spell.\n\nThe news that the Divine Music Department had defeated the Water Department in the freshman tournament spread throughout the entire Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy in an instant. The quick and simple end to the battle surprised everyone. All sorts of discussions about the Divine Music Department began to circulate throughout the academy. Ye Yin Zhu and the four beautiful girls who participated with him became the subjects of these discussions. In particular, the elemental shield Ye Yin Zhu released at the last moment and Hai Yang's guzheng became the focal points of debate.\n\nYe Yin Zhu didn't know that others were discussing him. As soon as the match ended, he left Trial Arena No. 6 and sprinted off in a certain direction. Because, just a moment before the match concluded, he had heard a voice—a voice that made him extremely excited.\n\nA yellow glow flashed past, leaving only a faint shadow on the path. Some mages walking through the academy couldn't help but wonder which high-year student from the warrior division had run over to the magic division again.\n\nIn order to reach his destination as quickly as possible, Ye Yin Zhu no longer concealed his Bamboo Dou Qi. After all, the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy was simply too large. Supported by his Bamboo Dou Qi, he pushed his speed to the limit and ran out of the academy in ten minutes.\n\nAfter leaving the academy, Ye Yin Zhu sped north for ten *li*¹ before stopping in front of a forest. The excitement on his face was hard to conceal, and with a surging heart, he called out in a loud voice, \"Zi, where are you? I'm here.\"\n\nYes, just as the match was ending, Zi's voice had sounded clearly in his ear. Zi had only said one thing: \"I'll be waiting for you in the forest ten *li* north of the academy.\"\n\nFor Ye Yin Zhu, although he had settled down at the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy, this was not his home. Zi was his partner of ten years; besides his family, Zi was absolutely the person he trusted most.\n\nA tall and stalwart figure slowly walked out from within the forest. His hair was still somewhat disheveled, and his star-like purple eyes looked a bit weary, but his rugged face had not changed in the slightest. Upon seeing Yin Zhu, the indifference in his eyes softened with a hint of warmth. Only when he was with Yin Zhu would his expression show such a change.\n\n\"Yin Zhu.\" The deep and magnetic voice filled Ye Yin Zhu with a strong sense of familiarity.\n\n\"Zi—\" Yin Zhu cried out in excitement, his body shooting forward like an arrow, trailing a strong yellow light. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of him, stopping as if nailed to the spot. The transition from motion to stillness was completely seamless.\n\n***\n\n¹ A *li* is a traditional Chinese unit of distance, roughly equal to 500 meters or about a third of a mile. Ten *li* is about 5 kilometers or 3 miles.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\">Qidian Chinese Network welcomes all readers to come and enjoy the latest, fastest, and hottest serialized works, all at Qidian Original!</a>",

I also saw your match on the stage just now. It seems you've already blended into the life here.\"\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu nodded. \"Zi, are you alright? I feel like you seem a little weary.\"\n\n  A cold glint flashed in Zi's eyes. \"It's nothing. I just went to do something that had to be done. And this is only the beginning.\"\n\n  Yin Zhu's heart skipped a beat. \"Zi, you're leaving again?\" As he asked this, his tone had already changed, filled with a sense of reluctance.\n\n  Zi showed a rare smile. \"You're a student here; I can't just have someone tagging along with you. You should study here. It's very suitable for you to adapt to everything on the continent. I've asked around; the Milan Magic and Martial Academy, also known as the Milan Royal Academy, has a very high reputation on the continent. Perhaps you won't be able to learn much about your Qin Magic here, but you'll gain worldly experience much more easily. Besides, you won't be in any danger here.\"\n\n  A determined light flashed in Ye Yin Zhu's eyes. His right hand shot out like a bolt of lightning, fiercely grabbing Zi's left arm. \"Zi, if you're going to leave, I'll go with you. The two grandfathers wanted me to get experience on the continent, and being with you is also a way to get experience. I don't want to be separated from you again.\" Although his hand only had four fingers, it was as firm as steel. Even Zi was a little surprised at how strong Ye Yin Zhu was.\n\n  Zi patted Yin Zhu's shoulder. \"I don't want to be separated from you either. But, as we are now, we aren't strong enough to do whatever we want on the continent. Staying here will be good for you. So, I have a compromise. I wonder if you'd be willing.\"\n\n  \"What compromise?\" Ye Yin Zhu asked curiously.\n\n  Zi said, \"This method can allow us to see each other at any time, even if I'm not by your side.\"\n\n  Yin Zhu paused, asking doubtfully, \"Is there really such a method?\"\n\n  Zi nodded, a determined light in his eyes. \"Everything I have today was granted by you. Don't ask me why. When you are strong enough, I will tell you everything. The method I'm talking about is called an Equal Life Contract.\"\n\n  \"Equal Life Contract? What's that?\"\n\n  Zi said, \"Mages on the continent can summon magical beasts to protect them, and warriors can have their own mounts, though it's not as easy as a mage's summoning. However, when a mage summons, they can only summon a magical beast of a corresponding level. And a mage can only sign a contract with one magical beast in their entire life, so low-level mages won't sign a contract lightly. They all wait until their magic level has increased before finding a suitable magical beast to be their lifelong partner. This is the so-called Master-Servant Contract. The reason magical beasts cannot be summoned beyond one's level is simple: it consumes the mage's own spiritual power during the summoning. Exceeding one's level would have a huge impact on the mage. The only exception is for mages of the summoning school who specialize in summoning arts. Therefore, for students in your Milan Magic and Martial Academy, unless they have a magical beast that can grow, it's unlikely they would have their own. But the Equal Life Contract I'm talking about breaks the rules of this Master-Servant Contract. Similarly, a person only has one chance in their life to complete this type of contract. And only I know the incantation for this contract. Once completed, it cannot be changed. To put it simply, if you and I sign such a contract, we will become contract partners. From now on, no matter where we are, we will have a faint spiritual connection. You can summon me to your side, and I can summon you to mine. This way, no matter how far apart we are, we can still meet. Each summoning can last for half an hour and consumes very little of one's own spiritual power.\"\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu said with pleasant surprise, \"Can humans only sign contracts with magical beasts? There's such a magical contract? That's great, let's start right now.\"\n\n  Just as Zi was about to say something, his expression suddenly changed. His gaze, cold as if it were tangible, shot toward one side of the woods.\n\n  \"Wait a moment.\" A figure shimmering with yellow light had already arrived before the two in the blink of an eye. Even Ye Yin Zhu couldn't see the figure's appearance clearly because its speed was simply too fast. But identification doesn't necessarily rely on the eyes; the familiar aura was enough for him.\n\n  \"Father!\" Yin Zhu shouted excitedly. That was right, this suddenly appearing figure was none other than Ye Yin Zhu's father, Ye Zhong.\n\n  Ye Zhong wore gray warrior's attire. Although he was nearly forty years old, he didn't look much older than Ye Yin Zhu, only much more mature. A verdant green longsword was strapped to his back. His gaze, as he looked at Ye Yin Zhu, was full of fatherly love.\n\n  Zi looked at Ye Zhong, and Ye Zhong turned his gaze to him. Their eyes collided in the air, and Ye Yin Zhu felt as if he saw a shower of sparks ignite in mid-air. In sixteen years, Ye Yin Zhu had grown up. Ye Zhong's Bamboo Dou Qi had also cultivated from the initial stage of the Yellow Rank to the sixth stage of the Yellow Rank. This was equivalent to a high-tier Cyan Rank Sky Warrior in the Rainbow Ranks, just one step away from becoming a Battle Master.\n\n  \"No wonder I always felt someone was following us when we left the Cerulean Sea. So it was you,\" Zi said in a low voice.\n\n  Ye Zhong smiled faintly. \"He's my only son. Whether it's me, his mother, or his two grandfathers, none of us could be completely at ease letting him travel the continent alone. So I've been protecting him in secret. Now that he has arrived at the Milan Magic and Martial Academy, my task can be considered complete.\"\n\n  \"What? Father, you've been following me all this time?\" Ye Yin Zhu looked at Ye Zhong in shock. \"Then do you know where the person who stole my ring is?\"\n\n  Before Ye Zhong could speak, Zi's expression changed drastically. His gaze fell on Yin Zhu's four-fingered left hand, only then noticing that the original spatial ring had been replaced by another. \"Yin Zhu, you lost your spatial ring? Then your qin...\"\n\n  Yin Zhu gave a bitter smile. \"It was lost along with the letter of introduction and the money.\"\n\n  \"What?\" Zi let out a low roar, and an overwhelming aura erupted from his body. Although there was no glow of Dou Qi, Ye Zhong saw in horror that the ground beneath Zi's feet had silently begun to crack. Zi's anger was so intense that even he felt a measure of pressure from it. He clenched his fists, producing a sickening crackle of bones that set one's teeth on edge. \"Let me find out who it was, and I will crush every single one of his bones.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\">Qidian Chinese Network welcomes all book lovers to visit and read.

    "content": "To my dear friends, please vote and add this book to your collection. Thank you.\n\n  —————————————————————\n\n  Ye Zhong gave his son a deep look and said seriously, \"What you have lost, you must rely on your own strength to get back. I can only tell you that the person who stole your ring is also in Milan. Son, you must remember, if you want to become a strong person, you must first learn to observe and perceive everything around you.\"\n\n  \"He's in Milan too?\" Yin Zhu looked at his father, thought for a moment, then said with determination, \"Papa, I will definitely get my ring back with my own strength.\"\n\n  Ye Zhong turned to Zi. \"Zi, I'd like to have a few words with Yin Zhu alone.\"\n\n  Zi ignored Ye Zhong, his gaze lingering on Yin Zhu for a moment before he turned and walked toward the woods.\n\n  \"Yin Zhu. I have seen everything you've encountered on this journey. But whether it was you killing those mages in Luna City or later losing the ring Grandpa Qin gave you, I never intervened. Do you know why?\"\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu shook his head, looking a little lost.\n\n  Ye Zhong said in a deep voice, \"Because I hope you can grow from your own experiences, not under my protection. Perhaps I could help you find your spatial ring this once, but what if I'm not by your side next time? You are sixteen this year. According to the customs of Longqinus, you are already an adult. From now on, you must learn to be strong, to face all difficulties by yourself. That is why I never interfered. You may no longer be following the path Grandpa Qin arranged for you, but I think that is a good thing. Your own path is one you must walk yourself. You must always remember the teachings your two grandfathers gave you.\"\n\n  Meeting his father's somewhat stern gaze, Ye Yin Zhu suddenly found that the feeling of being lost that had haunted him since leaving the Azure Sea had vanished. The two words, *be strong*, had already taken root and sprouted in his heart.\n\n  \"Dad, I will.\"\n\n  From \"Papa\" to \"Dad,\" though only a single word's difference, Ye Zhong could clearly feel that his son was truly about to grow up.\n\n  \"Yin Zhu, I don't oppose you killing people. However, I must tell you this: not all enemies must be killed. Some people's crimes do not warrant death, and you need to handle them in other ways. At the same time, killing comes with a price. Like when you killed those people at the Arcadia Mage Guild, the one who paid the price was not you, but the entire Arcadia Mage Guild, and even the entire kingdom. Fortunately, that was a situation we had hoped to see. Although Zi holds no malice toward you, he can be fanatical about certain things. His words are not always correct; you must have your own judgment. During the time you were separated, I followed him for a while. Later, I worried something would happen to you without your zither, so I mostly returned to your side. Zi must have a very mysterious background; he seems to have some special connection to the beastmen of the Far North Wasteland.\"\n\n  Hearing his father's words, Ye Yin Zhu couldn't help but frown and said resolutely, \"Dad, Zi would never harm me. We are brothers. What price did Arcadia pay for me?\"\n\n  Ye Zhong smiled faintly. \"You don't need to know about Arcadia's affairs yet; your two grandfathers will handle it. I am only reminding you, not making judgments for you. I also heard the proposal Zi just made. Although I don't know the true meaning of an Equal Lifebond Contract, I can be sure of one thing: once you complete this contract with him, you will never be able to have a magical beast of your own again. This type of contract is exclusive. As a mage, one's magical beast is extremely important. Your Grandpa Qin was forced to sign a contract with a low-level magical beast in his early years when his Zither Magic was too weak, which prevented him from ever having a powerful magical beast later on.\"\n\n  \"Grandpa Qin has a magical beast? How come I never knew?\"\n\n  Ye Zhong sighed. \"Your Grandpa Qin's magical beast died protecting him many years ago. To commemorate it, and because of the lingering effects of the contract, your Grandpa Qin never got another one. How you handle your relationship with Zi is up to you. I have to go. I left the Azure Sea this time partly to escort you to Milan, and partly to take care of some business in the Kingdom of Ascoli. You will stay at the academy. You don't need to come home at the end of the term; we will contact you. You've grown up. It's time for our Bamboo and Zither Sects to make a move.\"\n\n  After speaking, Ye Zhong hugged his son. Before Ye Yin Zhu could say anything more, he had already leaped up. Like a skipping meteor, he disappeared from sight in just a few bounds.\n\n  \"Be strong. I must be strong.\" Forcibly suppressing the sense of loss from his father's departure, Yin Zhu's clear eyes held something more. Combined with his recent experiences, this lesson from Ye Zhong was extremely important. Ye Yin Zhu was gradually shedding the life he had known in the Azure Sea, where he had to worry about nothing but his training. He understood now that from this day forward, he could only rely on himself.\n\n  Looking at the tall figure walking back toward him, Ye Yin Zhu smiled faintly and nodded at him. \"Let's begin.\"\n\n  Zi was taken aback. \"Begin? Begin what?\"\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu said, \"The Equal Lifebond Contract, of course!\"\n\n  Gazing deeply at Yin Zhu's handsome face, Zi said in a low voice, \"Are you really sure? I assume your father just explained the contract's drawbacks and its impact on your future. I hope you'll think it over carefully so you don't regret it later.\"\n\n  \"There's nothing more to consider. I've thought it through very clearly. Actually, when Dad told me how the contract would affect summoning magical beasts in the future, I just asked myself one question. I asked myself, which is more important: having a powerful magical beast, or having the ability to bring you to my side at any time? I don't think I need to say the answer.\" From start to finish, Ye Yin Zhu had never considered refusing the Equal Lifebond Contract because of the magical beast issue. His way of thinking was simple, but he often managed to grasp the crucial point. Signing the contract was not only a restriction on him but on Zi as well. If Zi wasn't worried, what did he have to be worried about? Can one not become a powerful master without a magical beast? His father had just told him that to become strong, he could only rely on himself.\n\n  Looking at the warm smile on Ye Yin Zhu's face, a deep emotion erupted from Zi's brilliant eyes. \"Good brother. I will never forget your trust.\"\n\n  \"We are brothers,\" Ye Yin Zhu said, just those three words. Indeed. Since they were brothers, what more needed to be said?\n\n  This was the look shared between the Zither Emperor and the Purple Emperor. From this moment on, for the rest of their lives, the bond of brotherhood between them never changed, only growing stronger with time.\n\n  \"Zi, let's begin.\" Yin Zhu could see that Zi was very emotional, and he felt just as emotional himself. As long as they completed this contract, he could see Zi at any time, even while at the academy.\n\n  \"Alright. Repeat after me.\" Zi had never been one to hesitate. \"Under the witness of the eternal sun, moon, and river of stars. I, Zi.\"\n\n  \"Under the witness of the eternal sun, moon, and river of stars. I, Ye Yin Zhu.\"\n\n  With some difficulty, Zi bit his right index finger. His blood was a pale purple, looking extremely strange.\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu did the same. Their bleeding fingers touched in mid-air. Instantly, the crimson and pale purple blood merged. A powerful surge of magical elements erupted like a storm, engulfing both their bodies. In the air, a light like a river of stars seemed to descend from the heavens, isolating them from everything around.",

Thank you.\n\n—————————————————————\n\nIn that instant, Ye Yin Zhu felt as if his spiritual power had arrived in another world. All his previous sensations vanished. The only thing he could feel was the presence of a majestic aura. That's right, it was the primordial might of the sun, moon, and stars.\n\nHis surroundings were bright, bathed in the brilliance of the celestial bodies, but the only thing Ye Yin Zhu could see was the purple figure before him.\n\n\"Open, Gate of Contract! Release your noble glory to grace my body; the undying seal shall be forged here. The earth has its bounds, the ocean has its shores, the north wind circles in the labyrinth, the beacon fire burns in the Sacred Circle. Hearken to the wish of the faithful; with our mutual blood as the guide, I, Zi, am willing from this moment forth to share my life with Ye Yin Zhu, in equal partnership and mutual aid, forever unchanging.\"\n\nAn immense purple light surged upward. In a flash, two beams of light shot from Zi's eyes, piercing deep into Ye Yin Zhu's heart. Yin Zhu clearly felt as if something new had been added to his mind; everything about Zi was being branded onto his soul and memory in a much more profound way. Imperceptibly, Zi's body seemed to become incomparably massive, yet at the same time, it also seemed to grow indistinct.\n\n\"Open, Gate of Contract! Release your noble glory to grace my body; the undying seal shall be forged here. The earth has its bounds, the ocean has its shores, the north wind circles in the labyrinth, the beacon fire burns in the Sacred Circle. Hearken to the wish of the faithful; with our mutual blood as the guide, I, Ye Yin Zhu, am willing from this moment forth to share my life with Zi, in equal partnership and mutual aid, forever unchanging.\"\n\nThe light that rose from Ye Yin Zhu's body was a milky white. The gentle white light and the domineering purple light instantly mingled, intertwining as they ascended. The majestic aura vanished. At this moment, both Ye Yin Zhu and Zi could clearly sense that everything about the other was completely transparent. Ye Yin Zhu seemed to see all of Zi, yet it was all exceptionally blurry. He felt the boundless sorrow and near-maniacal rage that had once existed in Zi's heart, and all these emotions were deeply imprinted upon him.\n\nA giant magic hexagram, formed from the convergence of purple and white, appeared above their heads. Their bodies were drawn together by an unseen force, rotating slowly. Their spiritual powers fused at this moment, and even their bloodlines, which were in contact, began to undergo subtle changes. Ye Yin Zhu could clearly feel his body brimming with infinite power, while Zi likewise felt his own mind becoming increasingly clear.\n\nIn truth, even Zi himself did not know that the Equal Life-bond Contract was the highest of all contracts. Once signed, not only could both parties summon each other, but at the instant the contract was completed, their abilities would be selflessly dedicated to one another, resulting in a degree of mutual supplementation. Ye Yin Zhu gained the benefits of increased life force and physical toughness. Zi, on the other hand, received a boost in spiritual power and greater clarity of thought. This was a cumulative increase that did not affect their inherent abilities. The manifestation of Zi's enhanced spiritual power was not yet obvious, but Ye Yin Zhu's Bamboo Dou Qi quietly leveled up to Yellow Bamboo, second stage, after the significant increase in his physical strength. In the Rainbow ranking system, this was equivalent to the middle stage of the Green level.\n\nMilan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts.\n\nAs the dean of the academy, Ferguson resided alone in a tall, tower-like building in the center of the campus, where the environment was most beautiful. Although this tower could not compare to the Seven Towers of Falan, it still represented his status within the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts.\n\nAt this moment, Ferguson was on a lounge chair on his balcony, basking in the warm sunlight while leisurely reading a magical journal from an old friend.\n\n\"Hm? What is this power? How strange.\" Ferguson's originally lazy gaze suddenly sharpened. He flipped himself upright and looked toward the north. A faint current of white and purple energy swirled in the air, lasting a full half-minute before gradually dissipating.\n\nSensing the distant aura, Ferguson thought to himself: *Such a strong elemental fluctuation, but it doesn't seem to be for attack or defense. Could it be that some powerful magical beast has been born? No, that's not right. The aura is very peaceful, not like a magical beast's. It's more like the elemental fluctuation of a summoning or a contract. Judging by where the light originated, it's clearly several dozen li¹ away. For me to feel the elemental aura from this far... what kind of contract or summoning could it be?*\n\nThere were very few things in Milan that could arouse Ferguson's interest. Today, the student who had used Lunar God's Aegis at the Red level to block a Yellow-level Water Dragon's Chant had piqued his interest slightly. But now, this white-and-purple elemental fluctuation presented him with an even greater temptation.\n\n\"Come forth, my old friend, Kesa.\" With a circle of his right hand, a purple current of air effortlessly formed a large magic hexagram in mid-air. Immediately following, a low roar filled with pressure resounded, and a massive figure emerged from the hexagram.\n\nIt was an enormous red dragon. Red dragons were members of the Dragon Clan. Although the red dragons were not the most powerful within the clan, they were true dragons, not tamed drakes. An adult red dragon could reach the eighth rank, and a Red Dragon King possessed power approaching the ninth rank. Against the fire magic and physical combat ability of an eighth-rank red dragon, no human without Purple-level strength could possibly hope to prevail.\n\nThe red dragon Ferguson had summoned, named Kesa, was a full twenty meters in length, clearly an adult. The pressure of an eighth-rank being caused all the small animals in the woods around the tower to faint.\n\nBeating the pair of wings on its back that could create hurricanes, Kesa lifted its relatively short forelimbs to pat its own head, looking drowsy. \"Old friend, what'd you call me for?\" As an intelligent magical beast above the seventh rank, although it lacked the ability of a ninth-rank beast to take human form, it had no problem speaking.\n\nFerguson smiled. \"Kesa, sorry to disturb your sleep. But I just detected a peculiar elemental fluctuation and want to go take a look. You know I'm a spiritual-系² magic user; I can't fly with magic.\"\n\nKesa rolled its eyes and reluctantly turned around in front of the tower, presenting its fat dragon rump to Ferguson. \"Get on. It's my lot in life to be your mount, anyway.\"\n\nFerguson chuckled, looking like he had the dragon completely wrapped around his finger. He ambled onto Kesa's back, walking all the way up to its neck before sitting down. He had no fear of falling off; with Kesa's power, even intentionally jumping off would be no simple matter.\n\nWith a beat of its massive wings, a fierce gust of wind kicked up. The red dragon Kesa's enormous body soared into the air, carrying a faint current of scorching air as it flew in the direction Ferguson indicated.\n\nA dragon taking flight from the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts was no longer anything new. Only some of the first-year students would feel any curiosity about it.\n\nFor a true dragon, a distance of several dozen li was but a matter of a dozen breaths. After confirming the location of the elemental fluctuation, Ferguson had Kesa descend.\n\nThe moment it touched the ground, Kesa's body suddenly trembled violently. Its immense draconic might was unleashed in an instant, and faint blue flames swirled around its massive body, even scorching the nearby forest to a crisp yellow.\n\n\"Kesa, what's wrong?\" Ferguson sensed his partner's unease.\n\nThe sleepiness in Kesa's eyes was now completely gone. Its draconic eyes shot out sharp glints of light as it scanned its surroundings. \"This is the aura of a growth-type magical beast. And it's an aura I find repulsive.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1. **li (里):** A traditional Chinese unit of distance, roughly 500 meters or about a third of a mile. \"Several dozen li\" would be 10-20 miles.\n2. **spiritual-系 (jīngshén-xì):** Literally \"spirit-system\" or \"mental-type\".

    "content": "To the friends who like this book, please vote and add it to your collection to support Xiao San, thank you.\n\n  —————————————————————————\n\n  \"Oh?\" Ferguson's interest was instantly piqued. He pressed, \"Then can you determine just what kind of magical beast this is?\"\n\n  The red dragon, Kosa, shook his massive head. \"No, I can't be sure. I can only sense that the aura of this growth-type magical beast puts immense pressure on me, but this is the first time I've ever encountered such an aura, so I can't determine what kind of magical beast it belongs to. Moreover, there's also the aura of a human here. Someone must be summoning a magical beast.\"\n\n  The Dragon Clan's ability to sense auras was a hundred times greater than a human's, so Ferguson didn't doubt his partner's words in the slightest. He couldn't help but fall into deep thought. Even for a growth-type magical beast, it would be impossible for Kosa to feel such immense pressure unless it had reached the ninth rank. If a ninth-rank magical beast really did appear here, that would be strange. The fact that Kosa felt disgust at least proved one thing: this magical beast was definitely not of the Dragon Clan.\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu had no idea that the Equal Life Contract he had just completed with Zi had already drawn the attention of Dean Ferguson. At this moment, he and Zi were walking back to the academy together.\n\n  \"Yin Zhu, I have to go now. If you ever run into trouble you can't solve in the future, just summon me.\" Zi had his arm around Yin Zhu's shoulder, the coldness in his eyes completely gone, replaced by the gentleness of an older brother caring for a younger one.\n\n  \"Zi, if you're ever in trouble, you must summon me too. I said I would protect you.\" Ye Yin Zhu smiled faintly. This time, he wasn't worried about Zi not being by his side. As long as he wished it, Zi could appear before him at any time.\n\n  After the contract was complete, both Yin Zhu and Zi felt an inexplicable mental link in their minds. The other's aura made them feel even more familiar, and through this mental connection, they could even sense each other's emotions.\n\n  \"Zi, I'm a little hesitant,\" Yin Zhu said.\n\n  \"Hesitant about what?\"\n\n  \"Today, the Freshman Tournament has already begun. We won our first match against the Water Department, but Grandma Nina said that the Water Department is the weakest of the nine magical departments. The opponents from the other departments are all very strong. I don't know if I should integrate my Sound Blades into my music to contend with them. Grandpa Qin said that any enemy who sees my Sound Blades must die, but Dad just told me that some offenses don't warrant death. Since it's just a competition, it naturally falls into the category of offenses that don't warrant death.\"\n\n  Zi understood the doubt in Yin Zhu's heart and smiled faintly. \"This is for you to decide. However, I can only say that while your Grandpa Qin is worried about your abilities being exposed, if you want to become a powerful expert, although hiding your strength is necessary at times, it's equally unhelpful if you don't train your abilities and increase your practical combat experience. Hiding is not the best method; making yourself stronger is the goal.\"\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu nodded. \"I was thinking the same thing. And more importantly, besides me, everyone in the Divine Music Department is a girl. I don't want them to get hurt in the upcoming matches, nor do I want them to help me block our opponents' attacks. I am a man; I must stand at the very front.\"\n\n  \"Yin Zhu, you're growing up fast. This way, I can leave without worry. You must remember one thing: our Equal Summoning can only succeed when the other party is not in a state of combat. That is to say, if you want to summon me to your side now, it requires that I am not currently in combat. Otherwise, the summon will fail. The reverse is also true. Only the party in combat can summon the one who is not.\" Zi patted Yin Zhu's shoulder again, then turned and left. Only then did Ye Yin Zhu realize that, without knowing it, he had already arrived back at the entrance of the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts.\n\n  He strolled into the academy. There was no need to hurry now, so he walked slowly by himself towards the Mixed District. His memory was excellent; after living at the academy for a few days, he had already memorized the routes to the places he frequented.\n\n  Breathing in the fresh air of the academy, he passed through the North District and was just about to reach the Mixed District when he was stopped by a group of people.\n\n  There were seven of them in total, of varying heights. The weapons on their bodies indicated that they did not belong to the North District's Magic Division.\n\n  \"Stop. You're Ye Yin Zhu, right?\" The seven of them formed a line, blocking Ye Yin Zhu's path.\n\n  \"I am. Do you need something?\" Yin Zhu frowned. His intuition told him these people did not come with good intentions.\n\n  \"Need something? Of course, we need something. Kid, you made us lose a lot of money today. We were planning on making some pocket money, but you, the lone green among the flowers,¹ had to go and ruin it. What do you have to say for yourself?\" The leader of the group was a tall young man, about the same build as Fisichella and appearing to be around twenty years old, with a fierce look on his face. He carried two giant battle-axes on his back.\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu looked baffled. \"I made you lose money?\"\n\n  \"Of course. You think I, Jianedi, would lie? Today, your Divine Music Department beat the Water Department. We bet on the Water Department to win, and we lost everything.\" It turned out that during the Freshman Tournament, some upperclassmen would secretly set up betting pools. Today's match between the Divine Music Department and the Water Department was the focal point of the entire tournament. Of course, the bet wasn't on who would win, because no one thought the Divine Music Department stood a chance. The bet was on whether the Divine Music Department could last half an hour against the Water Department. The result, clearly, was that the vast majority of people lost. This Jianedi and his six companions were all work-study students living in the Mixed District. They had little money to begin with, and after losing a good sum on what they thought was a sure bet, they couldn't contain their anger. They didn't dare to trouble the noble beauties of the Divine Music Department, so they cornered Ye Yin Zhu here, who also lived in the Mixed District, to vent their frustrations.\n\n  \"That's your business. What does it have to do with me? What do you want?\" Ye Yin Zhu was not one to be easily bullied. Facing the provocations of Jianedi and his six companions, he was thinking to himself that these people in front of him were probably what his father meant by \"offenses that don't warrant death.\"\n\n  \"What do we want? We don't want much. Just compensate us for our losses. It's not a lot, just forty gold coins in total. Give us the money and we'll leave. Otherwise, we'll have to teach you a lesson today.\" Jianedi's build was not much smaller than Zi's. He cracked his huge, fan-like hands together, producing a series of popping sounds from his knuckles. Coupled with his ferocious appearance, it was certainly intimidating. Unfortunately for him, he had picked the wrong target today.\n\n  \"I have no money, and even if I did, I wouldn't give it to you. I've heard that when you gamble, you should be prepared to accept your losses. Don't you understand that?\" A faint, cold light appeared on Yin Zhu's face. The Bamboo Dou Qi within him began to circulate, the explosive power he had gained from his contract with Zi surging within him, ready to be unleashed. Facing these opponents, he had no intention of using the Sea Moon Lute of Clear Splendor he had just obtained.\n\n  Just then, a bizarre scene unfolded. Jianedi, who was about to lash out, suddenly froze rigid, standing completely still as his eyes filled with terror. A seven-inch-long dagger had appeared at his throat, seemingly from nowhere. The dagger was black and non-reflective, but its chilling aura made his skin crawl, and he even began to tremble. The icy killing intent pricked at his throat, and he felt as if his own hot blood was about to burst forth.\n\n  \"That's right, just like that. Don't move. I can't guarantee my hand will stay this steady forever,\" a gentle voice sounded from behind Jianedi. Jianedi's six companions looked on in horror. At some point, a small, slender figure had appeared behind Jianedi. Right now, one of his hands was pressed against Jianedi's broad shoulder to support his body, while the other held the black-bladed dagger. Although his face wore a faint smile, his eyes were filled with a deathly, silent light.\n\n***\n¹ A Chinese idiom (萬花叢中一點綠) referring to a single man in a group of women.",

    "content": "I'll be uploading the second chapter of the day early. There will be one more tonight. Brothers, please add this to your collections and vote. Thank you.\n\n————————————————————————————\n\n\"Who are you?\" Ganedi shrieked in terror. He could clearly feel that the person behind him could take his life at any moment.\n\n\"This is the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy. Just like you, I'm a student here. If you want to bully my roommate, shouldn't you ask if I agree first?\" The small, thin student was none other than Ye Yinzhu's roommate, Sula.\n\nCold sweat trickled down Ganedi's forehead. He had already guessed that the person behind him must be from the Assassin Department. Over in the Warrior Division, no matter how strong a warrior was, they wouldn't want to make an enemy of someone from the Assassin Department. Assassins were everywhere, and no one wanted to be targeted by a killer. Ganedi had always been confident in his own strength, but to have Sula sneak up behind him and attack without any warning whatsoever showed that the assassin behind him was not someone he could handle. Even though this was within the academy, no one would doubt an assassin's ruthlessness. The first lesson in the Assassin Department was to face your enemy, no matter where you were, and to nip any potential threat in the bud. That was why there was a saying that circulated in the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy: It's better to provoke a teacher than any student from the Assassin Department.\n\n\"S-Sir, I know I was wrong. I didn't know Ye Yinzhu was your roommate. Please let me go, we'll leave immediately.\" Ganedi's voice was already trembling, because the black blade at his neck seemed to be scraping against his skin.\n\n\"The next time I see you, I won't say a word.\" Sula's gentle voice suddenly turned grim. What did a silent assassin represent? Destruction.\n\nThe black blade vanished without a sound, as if by magic. Under the watchful eyes of Ganedi's six companions, Sula's body swayed slightly and then disappeared right where he stood. Concealment. It was the Concealment skill, which only high-level assassins could master.\n\nA deep fear gripped the hearts of the seven boys. Ganedi glanced at Ye Yinzhu, not even daring to say a parting word of defiance, and scurried away with his companions.\n\nYe Yinzhu's gaze shifted to his left. The small, thin body materialized silently beside him. It was Sula.\n\n\"Sula, thank you,\" Yinzhu said with a small smile.\n\nSula looked at Ye Yinzhu with some surprise. In the instant before he had reappeared, he had clearly felt an invisible wave of mental energy lock onto his body.\n\n\"I'm sure you could have handled it even if I hadn't stepped in. But scaring them is better. That Ganedi is one of the top students in the second-year Heavy Sword Department; his martial skills are quite good. They probably won't dare to bother you again after this.\" Sula grinned, the dead stillness and chilling killing intent in his eyes having long since vanished.\n\nSula's performance just now had given Ye Yinzhu a completely new impression of him. Only now did he realize how strong his roommate was.\n\n\"Congratulations, Yinzhu.\"\n\n\"Congratulations? Oh, you mean our match against the Water Department today?\"\n\nSula gave him a thumbs-up. \"I never thought your Divine Music Department would have its day. Let's go, back to the dorm. What do you want to eat tonight? I'll make it for you.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled wryly. \"You really are a good, competent housekeeper. These four gold coins were well spent. Not only do I not have to clean the room, but I get meals too. You're even a free bodyguard.\"\n\nSula chuckled. \"If you think it's a bargain, I wouldn't be against a raise.\" As he spoke, he rubbed his right thumb, index, and middle fingers together, looking a bit shifty. In this state, no one would ever connect him to the cold-blooded assassin from moments ago.\n\nThe dorm room was still just as small, but it had already become a home for Sula and Ye Yinzhu. Living in a huge, luxurious villa wasn't necessarily comfortable. The dorm may be small, but it was clean and tidy. Every time Ye Yinzhu returned here, he would feel a sense of warmth. Since coming to the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy, the teacher who had left the deepest impression on him was naturally Nina, but among the students, the one who impressed him most was not Ocean or the beautiful girls of the Divine Music Department, but his roommate, Sula.\n\nSula was extremely capable. He always kept everything in the dorm in perfect order. Ye Yinzhu never even saw when he cleaned, yet it was hard to find a speck of dust in the room. Today, he had witnessed Sula's strength as an assassin, which had greatly astonished him. It seemed everyone had their own secrets, and Sula's were particularly numerous.\n\nPerhaps even Ganedi, the one who was attacked, didn't know what level of strength Sula possessed, but Ye Yinzhu knew clearly. An assassin would not easily release their Dou Qi; keeping their opponent from gauging their strength was an assassin's top priority. However, Ye Yinzhu's mental strength was far greater than that of his peers. The moment Sula had let Ganedi go and concealed himself, he had clearly sensed the aura of Dou Qi emanating from Sula's body was nearly on par with his own. This meant that Sula had, at the very least, reached the initial-stage Green Rank in Dou Qi. Among people their age, this was almost unimaginable. One had to know that even Ye Yinzhu had only managed to raise his Dou Qi to this level after more than ten years of single-minded, arduous cultivation! Without even needing to ask, Yinzhu could guess that Sula was definitely the strongest among this year's new students in the Assassin Department.\n\n\"Time to eat. What are you thinking about?\" Back to his usual self, Sula wore a carefree, happy expression. He pulled out a money pouch from his robes and began calculating their food expenses.\n\nTheir lunch was more lavish than the past two days: one meat dish, one vegetable dish, and four steamed buns. There was even a small pot of vegetable soup.\n\n\"Wow, Sula, what's the occasion? So much good food?\" Yinzhu asked in surprise.\n\nSula smiled. \"Didn't your Divine Music Department win today? Consider this a celebration for you. We're at that age where we're still growing, so we should eat some meat every month. You have another match this afternoon. Eat up. I'm free this afternoon, so after lunch, I'll go with you to the competition grounds to cheer you on.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sula.\" Ye Yinzhu suddenly felt as if something was caught in his throat.\n\nSula lowered his head, a peculiar light flashing in his eyes. He said, \"No need to thank me. If you really want to thank me, then keep working hard. If you can place and win some prize money, our lives will be much better in the future.\"\n\n\"I will.\" For his own dignity, and for Sula's, Ye Yinzhu, for the first time, clearly set his goal: to be the final champion of the new student tournament.\n\nThey wolfed down their lunch, and Sula accompanied Ye Yinzhu back to the Divine Music Department. At this time, all the beautiful girls of the department were present. Perhaps because of their victory against the Water Department that morning, the Divine Music Department was filled with a celebratory atmosphere.\n\n\"Yinzhu, you're finally here! Where did you go after the match?\" Xue Ling had sharp eyes and spotted Ye Yinzhu as soon as he approached the classroom.\n\nYinzhu still remembered the sudden kiss Xue Ling had given him in her excitement that day. Seeing her now made him a little awkward. His handsome face flushed as he said, \"Xue Ling, I went back to eat. Oh, let me introduce you. This is my roommate, Sula, from the Assassin Department.\"\n\nSula and Fisichella were definitely two different types of people. When Fisichella saw a beautiful girl, he wished he could pop his eyes out of their sockets. Sula's reaction, however, was very placid. Even the smile on his face faded a little as he simply gave Xue Ling a slight nod in greeting.",

Thank you.\n\n—————————————————————————————-\n\nThe first-year students of the Divine Music Department were all in the classroom, along with Hai Yang. At this moment, Hai Yang was sitting in a corner, tuning the strings of her guzheng.\n\nXue Ling said to Ye Yinzhu, \"Everyone's discussing this afternoon's match.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu asked, puzzled, \"Discussing? Didn't Grandma Nina already set the plan?\"\n\nXue Ling giggled. \"We're discussing the cheerleading squad. The senior girls said that if we can win one more match, they'll all come out to cheer for us at tomorrow's match. When that happens, it'll definitely be a shock to the whole academy. Yinzhu, why are you still calling Director Nina 'Grandma'? You're not afraid of dying, but we're afraid of being dragged down with you.\"\n\nYinzhu smiled faintly but didn't answer. Just then, the classroom door opened, and Nina walked in from outside. Although her expression still appeared as proud and cold as ever, everyone could sense that Nina was in a very good mood today; it was clearly visible from the hint of a smile at the corner of her eyes.\n\nClapping her hands, Nina drew everyone's attention to herself. \"Alright, everyone listen to me. I just came back from the drawing. Our opponent this afternoon is the Dark Magic Department. The tactics will be the same as this morning, but you must be extremely careful. The moment your defense can't withstand their attack, forfeit immediately. Ye Yinzhu, you will be in charge of making that call.\"\n\nFor the sake of fairness, during the round-robin stage of the freshman tournament, the drawing for the next match was always held after the current one concluded, excluding any opponents that had already been faced.\n\nUpon hearing that their next opponent was the Dark Magic Department, Xue Ling and Lan Xi cried out in shock at the same time. Kongque's expression changed, and though she said nothing, her proud face was tinged with gloom. Only Hai Yang, sitting in the corner, showed no reaction, remaining as cold and calm as ever.\n\nThe Nine Major Departments of the Magic Division were: Water, Fire, Wind, Earth, Light, Dark Magic, Summoning, Spirit, and Spatial Domain. Among them, the first six belonged to elemental magic, while the latter three were special types of magic. The most profound, naturally, was the Spatial Domain Department, and the most powerful were the Spirit and Summoning Departments. But the one people were least willing to face was the Dark Magic Department.\n\nQin Shang had once explained the mysteries of each department's magic to Ye Yinzhu in detail. Water magic was relatively weak in the initial stages. The Dark Magic Department, on the other hand, was the complete opposite, possessing the strongest magic in the early stages. It was known as the number one among Dark Mages below the Green rank. Most dark magic involved using something of oneself as a ritual offering to summon dark elements for one's own use. Its power was extremely formidable, and its corrosive magic, in particular, was something no one ever wanted to face. Once hit by a corrosive spell, the damage was often irreversible, which was why the beautiful girls of the Divine Music Department were so afraid.\n\n\"Grandma Nina, for this afternoon's match, could you let me arrange the tactics?\" Although this wasn't the first time he had called Nina 'Grandma' in public, it was definitely the most composed Ye Yinzhu had ever been.\n\nNina shot him a glare but, to everyone's surprise, didn't fly into a rage. Instead, she nodded and said, \"Fine. Since you are the captain, you can be in charge. But there's one thing I must make clear beforehand: safety is the top priority. I don't want any of you to suffer any mishaps. Magic has no eyes, and the spells of the Dark Magic Department are all very damaging.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu nodded and said, \"I understand. Senior Hai Yang, could I trouble you to play the piece 'A Chinese Ghost Story'¹ again this afternoon?\"\n\nHai Yang was taken aback, a trace of astonishment appearing on her pale, pretty face. \"Why? 'A Chinese Ghost Story' only expresses feelings of sorrow. The students from the Dark Magic Department aren't as easy to deal with as the Water Department. Even if 'A Chinese Ghost Story' is completed successfully, it might not be enough to make them lose their ability to fight.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said confidently, \"Please just follow my arrangement, Senior Hai Yang. And Xue Ling, Lan Xi, Kongque. You should all know this relatively common piece as well. Please play it on your respective instruments. Lan Xi, you'll play beside me. The guqin is the most difficult to harmonize with other instruments, so pay attention to my technique then.\"\n\nLan Xi nodded in agreement, somewhat excited. She had personally witnessed Yinzhu's skill with the guqin and had long wanted to ask him for guidance. Kongque, on the other hand, was not having it. She said irritably, \"Ye Yinzhu, what do you mean by this? If everyone is playing 'A Chinese Ghost Story', then who's going to defend against the Dark Magic Department's attacks?\"\n\n\"Me.\" Ye Yinzhu's answer was a single word, but it was spoken with unusual firmness.\n\nKongque said with some disdain, \"You think you can handle it?\"\n\nAmong the four girls participating, Ye Yinzhu's least favorable impression was of the proud Kongque. He said lightly, \"If I can't, can you? If you think you can withstand our opponents' magic attacks, I'll give you the captaincy.\"\n\n\"You...\" Kongque was furious. \"Who do you think you are, talking to me like that? Do you believe I'll...\"\n\n\"That's enough. The match hasn't even started, and you want to start fighting amongst yourselves? Kongque, remember, this is not your Palermo Kingdom. Since I have said that Ye Yinzhu is the captain, then from today onward, he will be in charge of all matters concerning the competition.\" Nina's calm voice cut Kongque's words short.\n\nThe Divine Music Department's afternoon match was held at the Dark Magic Department's Training Ground Number Four. This training ground was different from the conventional one used by the Water Department. Although it was about the same size, the various materials used to construct it were all black. Anyone coming here for the first time would feel a distinct sense of gloom.\n\nTraining Ground Number Four was experiencing a rare liveliness, the likes of which it had seldom seen since its construction. The number of people who came to watch the match between the Divine Music Department and the Dark Magic Department was a full twenty percent more than for their match against the Water Department that morning. Although the Divine Music Department had already won a match, no one was optimistic about their chances. Most students believed the Water Department had lost in the morning mainly because their freshmen had been too careless at the start, causing their attack speed to be a bit slow. But how could they have known that the slow release of magic was not due to carelessness, but was a result of the music's influence?\n\n\"Yinzhu, you have to give it your all! I bet one gold coin on your Divine Music Department to win,\" Sula whispered with a grin to Ye Yinzhu, who was preparing to enter the field.\n\nYe Yinzhu frowned and said, \"My grandfather said that gambling is bad.\"\n\nSula chuckled. \"A little gambling is just for fun, it's nothing. Alright, hurry up and get on the field. I'll be cheering for you the whole time.\"\n\nUnlike the first match, this time the Divine Music Department brought not one, but three sets of tables and chairs to the training ground. Apart from Ye Yinzhu, who carried his own set, the other two sets for Hai Yang and Lan Xi had already been brought over by students from other departments.\n\n\"Divine Music Department, let's go! Divine Music Department, victory is ours!\" The crisp shouts and eye-catching beautiful faces became the highlight of the entire field. The eight first-year freshmen from the Divine Music Department who weren't competing, all dressed in their school uniforms, were now on the side of the training ground cheering for Ye Yinzhu and the others. At this moment, most of the girls' gazes were fixed on Ye Yinzhu. Although Ye Yinzhu gave off the impression of coming from a poor background, his temperament and appearance were simply too outstanding. If not for his profession being the \"chicken-rib\"² Divine Music Master, female students would likely have already started pursuing him. Unfortunately, this was a world where strength came first.\n\nThe students of the Dark Magic Department were the fewest in number among the nine departments of the Magic Division, not much more than the Spirit Department's branch, the Divine Music Department. Each grade only had twenty to thirty students. Gathered together now, they appeared out of place among the students from the other departments.\n\nYe Yinzhu's table and chair were placed at the very front. Behind him, to his left and right, were Lan Xi and Hai Yang, with Xue Ling and Kongque standing at the very back. It was the first time Ye Yinzhu had seen their instruments. Xue Ling's instrument was a blue jade xiao, while Kongque's pipa was a creamy yellow, as translucent as if it were carved from ivory. The occasional sound produced when she touched the strings was filled with a resonant, metallic clang.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  *倩女幽魂 (Qiànnǚ Yōuhún)*: The title of a famous 1987 Hong Kong fantasy film, literally translated as \"The Ethereal Spirit of a Beautiful Maiden.\" It is known in the West as *A Chinese Ghost Story*.\n2.  *雞肋 (jīlèi)*: \"Chicken rib.\" An idiom for something of little value or interest, yet one is reluctant to discard it.

    "content": "The \"Highlighting Session\" will be held tonight at 12:10 as usual. All friends are welcome to join.\n\n---\n\nThe contestants from both sides had assembled, facing each other in the center of the arena. To Ye Yinzhu's surprise, the composition of the Dark Magic Department was the exact opposite of the Divine Music Department. The Divine Music side had one male and four females, while the Dark Magic side had four males and one female. Even more surprisingly, the female student was their captain. Judging by the emblem on her school uniform, she was a new first-year student.\n\n\"Dark Magic Department, first-year student, captain, Yue Ming. Please choose the competition format.\" The female captain of the Dark Magic Department spoke concisely. Her long, dark blue hair cascaded down her back over a black magic robe. Her large, otherwise captivating eyes emanated a deathly, nether light. Her entire body was so cold it seemed devoid of life.\n\n\"Divine Music Department, first-year student, captain, Ye Yinzhu. Team battle.\" Ye Yinzhu's reply was equally concise. The girl named Yue Ming before him had already put him on high alert. He thought to himself, the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts truly deserves its reputation as the continent's number one academy. Even a first-year student could be this exceptional. The Dark Magic Department before him was clearly in a different league from the Water Department he had faced in the morning.\n\nA male student from the Dark Magic Department snorted with contempt. \"Does your Divine Music Department need to carry tables onto the battlefield?\"\n\nXue Ling, standing behind Ye Yinzhu, shot back with a retort, \"Have you ever seen a Divine Music Master on a battlefield? Why don't you beat us first before you start bragging?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu and Yue Ming nodded to each other and retreated with their respective department members. The defensive shield of Training Ground No. 4 activated, and with a command from the referee, the match began.\n\nIn the stands, both Nina and the head of the Dark Magic Department were present. Unlike Vagle, the head of the Dark Magic Department was also an old man, but a very cold one. From his arrival until the start of the match, he hadn't uttered a single word. Perhaps his interest had been piqued by the Divine Music Department's victory. Dean Ferguson had once again appeared in the stands.\n\n\"That child, Yue Ming, is becoming more and more outstanding. I wonder how long the Divine Music Department can last in today's battle.\" Even he had no confidence in the Divine Music Department. Yue Ming was the granddaughter of an old friend of his, and he knew very well how powerful she was.\n\nThe moment the referee shouted \"Begin,\" ten crimson orbs filled with a deathly stillness appeared in mid-air, shooting toward the five from the Divine Music Department. A yellow light flickered; all five students from the Dark Magic Department were Yellow Rank mages. Their leader, Yue Ming, even radiated an elemental light of dark yellow, signifying the high tier of the Yellow Rank.\n\nInstantly cast Balls of Darkness. The feat immediately drew gasps of astonishment from the students watching around the training ground.\n\n\"Leave it all to me,\" Ye Yinzhu calmly instructed. The teardrop-shaped gemstone on his left ring flashed, and the *Ocean Moon's Pure Brilliance* appeared on the table before him. Faced with the pressure from Yue Ming, Ye Yinzhu's heart was now filled with a powerful will to fight.\n\nSeated before the zither, Ye Yinzhu seemed to transform into a different person. His elegant and composed hands rested on the strings. At this moment, his heart had entered a wondrous resonance with the *Ocean Moon's Pure Brilliance* zither.\n\nSeeing the ten Balls of Darkness closing in, Ye Yinzhu did not activate the Moon God's Guardian. His right hand plucked a string, and with a deep, resonant hum, the five Dark Magic students on the other side shuddered in unison. The magic incantations they had just begun were forcibly interrupted.\n\nIn the stands, Nina shot up from her seat, staring at Ye Yinzhu in the training ground in shock. *A sonic boom? Could it be a sonic boom? Otherwise, how could he have interrupted their spells before the zither's melody had even begun? But no matter how strong he is, he can't possibly have the magical level of the Green Rank!*\n\nWithout activating the Moon God's Guardian, amidst that low hum, a distant and powerful melody began to play. A blade of light, a mixture of yellow and red radiance, burst forth from Ye Yinzhu's zither strings, enveloped by the music. The sonic blade formed a wondrous arc, as if it had eyes of its own, and simply erased the ten incoming Balls of Darkness from mid-air, leaving not a single trace behind.\n\nNina's sudden rise was a bit conspicuous in the stands, but now, one had become two. The second person to stand was none other than the Dean of the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts, the Purple Rank grand magus of the Spirit Department, Ferguson.\n\n\"The union of magic and martial arts,\" a voice filled with astonishment came from Ferguson's mouth. No one present had sharper senses than him. He clearly felt that the sonic blade Ye Yinzhu had unleashed was not simple magic. The red was the spiritual magic power stirred by the zither's music, while the yellow was pure Dou-qi!¹ What amazed him most was the perfect fusion of the zither's music and the Dou-qi, forming a unique energy. Among Red Rank spells, the Ball of Darkness was superior in power to those of all other departments, yet before the sonic blade, ten of them couldn't even withstand a light pluck of Ye Yinzhu's zither string.\n\nNo one had expected such a turn of events, not even the four girls behind Ye Yinzhu, who were all stunned. But in the next moment, their senses were awakened by his music.\n\nIt was the same piece, \"A Chinese Ghost Story,\" but when played by Ye Yinzhu, it was completely different from Hai Yang's rendition. A faint sorrow, like aged wine, left a long, lingering aftertaste. The gentle music of the zither, with its rippling echoes, was not loud, yet it clearly entered the ears of everyone present. Even the students watching from outside the training ground's defensive shield seemed to feel their emotions begin to rise and fall with the melody.\n\nAmong the four girls of the Divine Music Department, Hai Yang had the highest magic cultivation. She was the first to react. A clear and richly textured sound from her guzheng flowed out as her hands swept across its twenty-one strings, producing a light hum like a dragon's cry that blended with the zither's music. Immediately after, a zither melody identical to Ye Yinzhu's, albeit slightly less practiced, rang out. Lan Xi did not look at the Jade Melody Zither before her; at this very moment, her gaze was fixed entirely on Ye Yinzhu's hands. It was only then that she noticed he had only four fingers on each hand.\n\nThe sound of large and small pearls dropping onto a jade plate joined in at the perfect moment. A clear tone, like a silver vase suddenly shattering, pierced through the music, instantly adding a touch of grim killing intent to \"A Chinese Ghost Story.\" At the same time, the deep, long, and delicate notes of a xiao descended as if cloaked in sorrow.\n\nWhat the five members of the Divine Music Department were now displaying with their four different instruments was the Divine Music Master's ensemble skill.\n\nEnsemble refers to multiple Divine Music Masters playing the same piece of music simultaneously. Even if their magic levels differ, as long as the music is coordinated skillfully, they can achieve a stacking effect.\n\nIn an instant, four streams of red light, mingled with the deep orange released by Hai Yang, surged forth, spreading like a vortex to fill every corner of Training Ground No. 4. The most terrifying aspect of a Divine Music Master's magic was its indefensible nature. No magic or Dou-qi could block the spiritual attacks transmitted through melody. One could only rely on their own spiritual power to resist it head-on.\n\nWhen the zither music had first started, the four Dark Magic students other than Yue Ming hadn't paid it much mind. The highest-ranked among the five from the Divine Music Department was only Orange Rank. Even if the music took effect, they were confident they could withstand it with their spiritual power. However, after seeing Ye Yinzhu erase their Balls of Darkness with a single sonic blade, these Dark Magic students realized that the Divine Music Department was anything but simple. With their incantations broken, they reacted instantly, concentrating all their magical power and frantically unleashing a barrage of instantly cast Red Rank spells toward Ye Yinzhu's group.\n\nIn truth, the first note Ye Yinzhu had produced was not the traditional Divine Music Master's sonic boom. He indeed lacked the Green Rank ability required to produce one. That zither note was a sonic explosion of his own invention, using sound as a base and detonating it with Dou-qi. Back when he faced the Blue Rank mage Lufite, he had used this very move to gain the upper hand with a surprise attack.\n\n---\n¹ Dou-qi (鬥氣): A term from Chinese fantasy genres for a form of energy or internal power cultivated for martial arts.",

    "content": "Four chapters will be updated today, with one each at 8 PM and 12 AM tonight. Additionally, at 12:05 AM, we will be holding a \"Post Highlighting Convention\"¹ to thank our readers for their support. Everyone is welcome to attend. There will be 8 \"featured thread\" slots given out.\n\n——————————————————————————-\n\nStreams of gentle sound blades drifted out from Ye Yinzhu's eight fingers. Although the dark magic was filled with corrosive properties and tyrannical attack power, it was completely unable to get within five meters of him.\n\nYe Yinzhu's left hand played the Echoing Valley stance while his right hand played the Flowing Spring stance simultaneously. \"Now you take one from me.\" Four sound blades crossed in mid-air to form the shape of the character *mi*² and drifted toward the five dark magic students. The sound blades were extremely wondrous, floating in mid-air as if weightless, constantly changing direction, yet their speed was so great they vanished in a flash.\n\nThe last time he killed Rufete and the others, Ye Yinzhu knew he was outmatched and had taken advantage of his opponents' astonishment at his zither music to unleash the Seven Kill Tones with all his might, fully erupting with his Dou Qi and zither magic to succeed in one fell swoop. This time, however, he was holding back somewhat. After all, at his current level of strength, if he were to unleash the Seven Kill Tones, he would have no energy left.\n\nSuddenly, a dense black fog erupted from Yue Ming's chest, forming a wall of black mist in the air. As the *mi*-shaped sound blades shot into it, this Night Mist spell trembled violently a few times but ultimately blocked the attack.\n\n\"Shadow Split,\" Yue Ming called out in a low voice. She sounded a little breathless; although she had used a magical item to cast the defensive spell, taking the full brunt of the four sound blades had greatly taxed her magical power.\n\nThe five dark magic students simultaneously took out a black pearl and crushed it in their hands. In an instant, countless black figures spread out. Each of them had unexpectedly split into six figures, which quickly dispersed to encircle the Divine Music Department. Unable to chant an incantation, they had relied on a magical item to instantly cast this Yellow-rank spell—Dark Shadow Split. The Dark Magic Department was not as poor as the Water Department.\n\nThe Shadow Split skill was perfectly suited to deal with the current Ye Yinzhu. The dark magic students lacked the ability to block the sound blades head-on, but by suddenly releasing multiple doppelgangers, they made it impossible for Ye Yinzhu to pinpoint their true bodies. Sound blades consumed a great deal of Dou Qi and magical power, so Ye Yinzhu would not use them lightly. However, his performance of *A Chinese Ghost Story* was already one-third complete.\n\nThe one-third mark was precisely when Ye Yinzhu's zither music began to take effect. The five dark magic students almost simultaneously felt a powerful sense of sorrow welling up from deep within their hearts. Subconsciously, they seemed to only want to listen to the music, not continue the match. The doppelgangers created by Shadow Split had already begun to blur.\n\nYue Ming, after all, was a mage of the same level as Ye Yinzhu. At the critical moment, she bit her lower lip hard, using the sharp pain to clear her head, and shouted, \"Appear, my partner, Ming Xue!\"\n\nA dark blue magical hexagram materialized in the air before the swarm of black figures. A graceful figure appeared—it was a little girl who looked to be only six or seven years old, floating in mid-air. Her deep blue hair flowed behind her, so long that it extended past her feet. Her large, black eyes were filled with an icy aura. A faint, dark blue light swirled continuously around her body. The strangest thing was that her body appeared to be transparent, as clear as crystal.\n\nIn the stands, Nina's face changed drastically, and she cried out, \"A growth-type undead magical beast, the Nether Snow Sprite!\"\n\nAll growth-type magical beasts possessed the potential to evolve to the level of sentient magical beasts, though the process was long and arduous. Undead growth-type magical beasts were so rare their numbers could be compared to Ninth-Rank giant dragons, let alone the Nether Snow Sprite, the cream of the crop among them. One had to know that a contract with any growth-type magical beast must be made starting from its infancy. An adult Nether Snow Sprite was a Ninth-Rank magical beast, and it could only give birth to a single soul sprite in its lifetime. To obtain this soul sprite and form a contract, one must not only find a Nether Snow Sprite but also defeat the adult, which was equivalent to a Purple-rank, dual-element (Water and Dark) Archmage.\n\n\"Sprite Shriek!\" As Yue Ming shouted, the clearly not-yet-adult Nether Snow Sprite let out a long, sharp shriek. The ear-piercing cry was filled with mournful sorrow and coldness. But it was this sudden sound that instantly weakened the effect of *A Chinese Ghost Story*, played in concert by the five members of the Divine Music Department.\n\n\"Snow Dance,\" Yue Ming issued another command. Immediately, dark blue motes of light began to appear around the Nether Snow Sprite's body, gradually coalescing into tiny snowflakes that danced in the air.\n\nTaking this opportunity, Yue Ming quickly gathered with her four dark magic companions and began their incantation.\n\n\"Oh, God of Darkness..., you who walk from the void...\" the first dark magic student chanted.\n\n\"...Carrying deep sorrow..., take my soul...\" the second dark magic student surprisingly continued the first one's incantation.\n\n\"...Bring despair to my enemies..., shroud the world in slaughter...\" The third person's continuation was still perfectly harmonious, as if the spell were being chanted continuously by a single person. As each person chanted, a large amount of yellow light was released from their bodies, converging in the center of the five.\n\n\"...I swear upon my blood..., I offer my soul...\" Just as the fourth person finished their part, they and the previous three simultaneously spat out a mist of blood. The yellow light that had gathered before instantly turned a ghastly green.\n\nIn the stands, Ferguson said in surprise, \"Overlapping Chant, the Dark Demonic Curse. This is a high-level dark magic spell. Director Basten, the new students of the Dark Magic Department are quite outstanding this year!\" As he spoke, his own purple magical energy had already begun to gather. As the academy's dean, he did not want any casualties to occur in the freshman tournament.\n\nThe silent Director of the Dark Magic Department, Basten, could only be described as feeling bitter at this moment. A high-level dark magic spell like the Dark Demonic Curse was something that even few fifth-year students could cast alone. This cleverly designed Overlapping Chant had originally been prepared for a more crucial match, to allow the Dark Magic Department to make a stunning debut. But he never expected to be forced to use it in the second round against the Divine Music Department, who were known as \"chicken-rib\"³ mages. Although he believed victory was already assured, revealing their strength so early was clearly not something he wanted to see.\n\n\"Dark Demonic Curse—Hell's Wail,\" Yue Ming completed the final line of the incantation. In an instant, the ghastly green light enveloped all five dark magic students, and an incomparably mournful scream instantly engulfed the entire arena.\n\nWhile the dark magic students were performing their incantation, Ye Yinzhu and his team were also in considerable trouble. The dual-element (Dark and Snow) undead growth-type magical beast, the Nether Snow Sprite, was causing them immense problems.\n\nEven though it was still in its growth period, this Nether Snow Sprite already possessed strength exceeding the fourth rank. The dark blue snowflakes were not only filled with an icy aura and as sharp as blades; what was more terrifying was the corrosive property they contained. If even a single one touched you, it would mean corrosive destruction!\n\n*A Chinese Ghost Story* had not stopped. Ye Yinzhu knew that a Divine Musician's music was absolutely effective against any creature with a soul, and undead magical beasts were no exception. Sound blades could not possibly block the all-pervasive snowflakes, so at the critical moment, he released the Guardian of the Moon, enveloping all five members of his team and letting the dark blue snowflakes slice against it. At the same time, his hand positions shifted slightly, and he channeled Dou Qi directly into his fingertips, instantly doubling the volume of the zither music to suppress the Nether Snow Sprite's shriek.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Post Highlighting Convention (加精大會, *jiājīng dàhuì*)**: In Chinese web novel communities, authors can \"highlight\" or \"feature\" reader comments as a form of recognition.

    "content": "Today's third chapter is a bit late, and for that, Xiao San apologizes to you all. However, there will be another chapter update tonight at midnight. Fans of *Zither Emperor* won't want to miss it. We'll also be holding an event to highlight the best community posts, so feel free to join in.\n\n———————————————————————————————-\n\nAmidst the deep, distant notes of the zither, his elegant and mellow voice rose from the quintet's performance:\n\n\"Life,\nA dream like a long road.\nLet the wind and frost, the wind and frost, leave their mark upon my face.\nIn this world of red dust,¹\nIn how many directions can a beautiful dream go?\nSearching foolishly for a dream-like love,\nThe road ahead is lost in haze, as am I.\"\n\nThe Zither Song. The last time it had appeared was in harmony with Hai Yang, but only now was Ye Yinzhu demonstrating its true power. The combined emotional force of zither and voice permeated the mind of every person present. On the other side, of the five Dark Magic students who had just completed their incantation, only Yue Ming, with her exceptional mental fortitude, managed to hold on. The other four, struck by the Zither Song's psychic impact, had completely lost their sense of self. Moved by the melody's sentiment, they even began to weep, all combat capability lost.\n\nMost bizarre of all was the reaction of the Stygian Snow Soul closest to Ye Yinzhu.\n\nUnder the direct assault of the Zither Song, a ripple-like pulse appeared on Ming Xue's crystalline body, and the number of dark blue snowflakes in the air noticeably dwindled. What was most strange was that a flicker of emotion appeared in her large, deathly-still eyes. A trace of faint sorrow touched her flawless face as her body drifted forward, as if pushed by a gentle breeze, until she was directly in front of Ye Yinzhu.\n\nAlthough the four Dark Magic students—all except Yue Ming—were now completely lost in the Zither Song and unable to fight, their overlapping chant had already brought the Dark Magic spell to completion. A massive black magic hexagram appeared silently before Yue Ming, and immediately after, countless piercing shrieks erupted from within it.\n\nGhastly green phantoms, as if clawing their way out of hell itself, burst from the black hexagram with piercing shrieks, swarming toward the five from the Divine Music department like a tidal wave. Judging by the color of the magic, it had reached the mid-tier of the Green Rank. That the combined power of four Yellow-rank students' overlapping chants could be so formidable made the color drain from the faces of Ye Yinzhu and his companions.\n\n\"Yinzhu, look out!\" Su La's anxious voice cried out, amplified by his Battle Qi.\n\nYe Yinzhu paid no mind to Ming Xue, who had floated to his side and ceased her attacks. His clear black eyes filled with resolve. He knew he could not retreat; behind him were Hai Yang and the other three women. He would have to rely on his own power to withstand the Dark Magic department's final assault. In an instant, Ye Yinzhu's eyes turned crimson. A powerful, dark red magical aura surged forth as he pushed his mental energy to its absolute limit, strengthening the Moon God's Protection to the maximum level he could sustain.\n\nHis Battle Qi condensed, contained but not dispersed. Hidden beneath his sleeves, his eight fingers had taken on the color of yellow jade. The melody of *A Chinese Ghost Story* came to an abrupt halt. His eight fingers simultaneously pressed down on the seven strings of the Ocean Moon's Pure Splendor zither before pulling back. With both his magical power and Battle Qi pushed to their absolute peak, waves of faintness began to wash over his mind.\n\nYe Yinzhu knew he still had the Aegis of Life on his wrist, which could provide an absolute defense that the Dark Magic spell could never breach. But his innate pride kept him from using it. He knew that if he grew too reliant on the Aegis, it would become a great hindrance to his future development. Therefore, he would never activate it lightly unless he had no other choice.\n\nThe Dark Magic spell, Hell's Wail, had produced several dozen specters. While Yue Ming and her classmates lacked the power to unleash the high-level spell's full potential, the result was still formidable. Training Ground Four filled with mournful shrieks and the oppressive fluctuations of dark elemental magic. The immense pressure caused the faces of the four women behind Ye Yinzhu—all except Hai Yang—to pale.\n\nJust as Ye Yinzhu gathered all his energy, preparing for a decisive clash with the Dark Magic spell, something bizarre occurred. At some point, the human-like emotion in the deathly-still eyes of Ming Xue, who had floated to Ye Yinzhu's side, had grown more and more apparent. As if having made a decision, her body suddenly shot sideways, silently placing herself in front of Ye Yinzhu. The move caused him, who was just about to unleash his full-powered attack, to hesitate for a split second.\n\nHer long, dark blue hair floated up behind her, though there was no wind, forming a great circular barrier. A current of black energy centered on her body, creating a massive black hole that pulsed with a cold, powerful suction.\n\nThe specters flying from the black hexagram shrieked in terror. Their ghastly green light flickered violently, as if in fear. But in the face of the black energy radiating from Ming Xue, these specters unleashed by the Dark Magic spell were completely powerless to resist. Like green arrows, they were drawn into Ming Xue's black hole and frantically devoured.\n\nYue Ming was completely stunned. She could never have imagined that the strongest Dark Magic attack she had so painstakingly unleashed would be blocked by her own magical beast. Although she could still clearly feel her mental link to Ming Xue, in that moment, she had lost all control over her. For a magical beast bound by a master-servant contract, this was almost impossible.\n\nOn the platform, the perpetually silent head of the Dark Magic department, Basten, could finally no longer remain seated. He shot to his feet, his aged face filled with horror. A magical beast defying its master's control—what did that mean? Could a backlash be next? He couldn't believe that what he had thought was a certain victory could take such a turn at the most critical moment.\n\nThe four women behind Ye Yinzhu were also stunned. The melody of *A Chinese Ghost Story* ended at that very moment. As part of the performance, a subtle feeling stirred in Hai Yang's heart. Among the five competitors from the Divine Music department, her spiritual cultivation was second only to Ye Yinzhu's. She had a vague sense that Ming Xue's transformation was deeply connected to the piece their quintet had just performed.\n\nThe Dark Magic spell had been incredibly difficult to conjure, but it was devoured with astonishing speed. In the space of just a few breaths, the ghastly green specters had vanished completely, and the black hexagram before Yue Ming silently closed. Due to the excessive drain on her mental energy and the shock she had suffered, Yue Ming swayed and nearly collapsed, only managing to stay upright by leaning heavily on her magic staff.\n\nMing Xue floated back to Ye Yinzhu's side. Having devoured the Dark Magic spell, her body seemed to have become somewhat more solid. In that short span of time, she appeared to have aged; her previous form, that of a six or seven-year-old, now looked to be eight or nine. But what sent a chill through Yue Ming's heart was the glint of contemplation she saw in Ming Xue's eyes. One must understand that Ming Xue, a growth-type magical beast, was only between the fourth and fifth ranks. Contemplation was an emotion that should only appear in intelligent-type magical beasts of the seventh rank or higher.\n\nIn the stands, Ferguson's brow furrowed in thought. \"That Stygian Snow Soul,\" he mused, \"it seems to have evolved.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Red Dust (紅塵)*: A Buddhist/Taoist term for the mortal world, representing worldly desires, strife, and suffering.",

    "content": "Today's fourth chapter. The featured post drive¹ is about to begin! After 12 o'clock, I'll have to trouble you, my dear readers, to cast your precious recommendation tickets for Xiao San and help me climb the rankings. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nYe Yinzhu had already closed his eyes the moment Ming Xue began to devour the Dark Demonic Curse. A faint smile touched his lips as the douqi and magical power he had previously gathered slowly dispersed. However, because he had been preparing to unleash a full-power attack, he still suffered a degree of elemental backlash, spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood.\n\n\"You, what did you do to Ming Xue?\" Yue Ming stared at Ye Yinzhu beside Ming Xue, her voice laced with terror.\n\nSlowly opening his eyes, Ye Yinzhu's gaze was as clear as ever, showing no signs of fatigue from the elemental backlash. He smiled faintly and said, \"I didn't do anything. I can only say that our music can influence you, and it can also influence magical beasts. Any creature with a soul will be affected by the emotions in the music. You should care more about your magical beast. She doesn't seem happy following you. If you can't make her follow you willingly, then she can never become your best partner.\"\n\nYue Ming stared blankly at Ye Yinzhu. Suddenly, a cold glint flashed in her eyes and she shouted, \"Ming Xue, attack him!\" She believed that if not for Ming Xue's last-minute betrayal, her Dark Magic Department would have already won. At the same time, she refused to believe that her own magical beast would disobey her command.\n\nMing Xue hovered there, looking at Ye Yinzhu beside her, then at Yue Ming. In a very human-like way, she lowered her head and shook it at Yue Ming.\n\n\"You... you refuse to attack him?\" This time, Yue Ming was completely stunned, not a trace of color left on her pretty face.\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled slightly at Ming Xue beside him and said, \"Go back.\"\n\nMing Xue looked at Ye Yinzhu and actually bowed to him respectfully. Two clumsy words came from her mouth, \"Thank... you...\" Her delicate form spun in the air, and wrapped in her long, dark-blue hair, she dissolved into a patch of dark blue specks of light and disappeared.\n\nYue Ming's gaze toward Ye Yinzhu became incomparably complex. Her own magical beast not only disobeyed her but followed her opponent's command instead. At this moment, aside from the icy cold in her heart, all that remained was endless resentment toward Ye Yinzhu. Ming Xue was a powerful magical beast that her grandfather had spent countless efforts to find for her. Once Ming Xue grew to Rank 7 or higher, coupled with Yue Ming's own advancing magical prowess, she could become a powerhouse capable of contending with Dragon Knight Generals. But now, this beautiful future seemed to have been destroyed by the male student from the Divine Music Department before her.\n\n\"Miss Yue Ming, my mother told me to be respectful to girls. So, I don't want to attack again. Please concede,\" Ye Yinzhu said, looking at Yue Ming with some helplessness. In truth, even he wasn't entirely sure why Ming Xue had acted that way. But with his keen perception of auras, he clearly sensed Yue Ming's deep-seated hostility toward him.\n\nYe Yinzhu's good intentions sounded exceptionally jarring to Yue Ming. The excessive consumption of her spiritual power, coupled with the mental blow, made it impossible for her to hold on any longer. Her vision went black, and she fainted on the stage.\n\nTraining Ground Number Four was dead silent. The venue, with nearly eight thousand spectators, remained without a sound for a full minute.\n\n\"Divine Music Department wins.\" The referee finally snapped back to reality. The match, full of twists and turns, was finally over. The never-favored Divine Music Department had once again created a miracle. The Dark Magic Department, with five Yellow Rank magicians, had actually lost—lost to a team from the Divine Music Department composed of one Orange Rank and four Red Rank magicians. To anyone, this victory was unbelievable. Even the Divine Music Department's Head, Nina, had held no illusions of victory after seeing the Umbral Snow Soul appear, yet victory had come so swiftly.\n\nWhen Ye Yinzhu walked out of the training ground, everyone's gaze toward him had become somewhat peculiar. The students of the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts were all elites; anyone could see that the key to this match's victory lay with this \"single green leaf among a thousand flowers,\" the first-ever male student of the Divine Music Department. That miraculous Sound Blade, which had blocked the Dark Magic Department's instant-cast spells, had also made its first official appearance on the stage of the Longqinus Continent's history.\n\nDean Ferguson gave Ye Yinzhu a deep look from afar but said nothing more before turning to leave. The teachers from the Dark Magic Department, with grim faces, went to treat their students who had been affected by the Divine Music Department's music. In stark contrast to their mood, Nina was so excited she could hardly contain herself. For so many years, the Divine Music Department had held the title of the number one department at the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts but was ignored by everyone. At this very moment, they had finally become the academy's focal point.\n\nIf the Divine Music Department's victory in the first match against the Water Department was due to magical items and a certain amount of luck, then this match against the Dark Magic Department was a true test of strength. Now, no one doubted the Divine Music Department's power.\n\n\"Divine Music... will win...! Divine Music... will win...!\" Cheers rose and fell in waves, especially from the eight beautiful girls in the first year of the Divine Music Department, who were shouting at the top of their lungs.\n\nYe Yinzhu managed to squeeze out of the cheering crowd with great difficulty, escorting the four girls and the other first-year beauties back to the Divine Music Department's building.\n\n\"Yinzhu, you're amazing! How did you do that just now? What was that attack that looked like a wind blade?\" Xue Ling asked excitedly, her big, pretty eyes sparkling with little stars.\n\nThough Ye Yinzhu was naive, he knew the secret of the Sound Blade couldn't be revealed casually. Just as he was wondering how to answer, Nina appeared. \"Ye Yinzhu, come with me.\" Nina's face appeared calm, but her glittering eyes betrayed her current exhilaration.\n\n\"Oh.\" He answered and followed Nina out of the classroom.\n\nAs the Head of the Divine Music Department, Nina had her own private office. The huge, luxurious office was nearly the size of a classroom, with various elegant magical decorations arranged on the surrounding walls. Nina pointed to the sofa in front of her desk and said, \"Have a seat.\"\n\nIt was Ye Yinzhu's first time here, and he couldn't help but look around curiously. The genuine leather sofa was soft and comfortable to sit on, and the fatigue from the match seemed to be gradually carried away by the comfort.\n\n\"Grandma Nina, did you need me for something?\" Ye Yinzhu asked tentatively.\n\nNina pondered for a long while before suddenly looking up, her gaze burning as she stared into Ye Yinzhu's eyes. \"Tell me, the Sound Blade you released just now, was it a combination of douqi and magic?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" Ye Yinzhu faltered, hesitating for a moment before nodding slowly. \"Yes, it was.\" Zi was right. His Sound Blade would appear before the continent sooner or later. While its secrets couldn't be known by others, this special attack method itself didn't need to be hidden so deeply.\n\nNina stood up in excitement, but she soon sat back down again with a sense of dejection. She sighed and said, \"Yinzhu, does that mean you are dual-cultivating in magic and martial arts?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" Ye Yinzhu said, scratching his head. In truth, even he wasn't sure if what he was doing counted as dual cultivation.\n\nNina's brow furrowed slightly. \"Has that old bastard Qin Shang gone mad? Does he want to ruin you?\"\n\n\"Ah? Grandma Nina, why would you say that?\" Ye Yinzhu asked, looking at her in shock.\n\nNina said irritably, \"How can lowly martial arts compare to our noble magic, especially that of the most noble Divine Music Masters? You've mixed martial techniques into your music. Although it can eliminate the drawback of a Divine Music Master's musical effects being slow to activate, it also makes your music impure. Doing this will bring no benefit to your future advancement. Doesn't Qin Shang know that?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said with a somewhat blank expression, \"I don't know either. Grandpa Qin has taught me to train this way since I was little. It doesn't seem to be a bad thing.\"\n\n***\n¹TN: 加精大會 (jiājīng dàhuì) is web novel slang. \"加精\" means to have a post/chapter marked as \"featured\" or \"high-quality.\" The author is playfully calling this release event a \"featured post drive/convention.\"",

    "content": "A new week has begun. Friends, please vote and add to your collection to support Xiao San. Thank you.\n\n  ———————————————————\n\n  Nina snorted. “Although combining magic and martial arts can unleash great power, because one doesn’t specialize, the cultivation speed drops drastically after reaching the Green Rank. Perhaps one could still succeed, but the effort required would be several times that of a dedicated magician or warrior. And once you reach the Purple Rank, a Magic-Martial Warrior might not necessarily have an advantage over a dedicated warrior or magician.”\n\n  Ye Yinzhu shook his head and said, “I don’t know if what you say is correct, but I believe Grandpa Qin would never harm me.”\n\n  Looking at Ye Yinzhu's calm yet extremely resolute gaze, Nina was at a loss for words. From her own perspective, she naturally wouldn't question Qin Shang's teachings; after all, Qin Shang was the continent's number one Divine Music Master, a realm she could hardly compare to in the field of Divine Music. However, she truly couldn't figure out why Qin Shang would have Ye Yinzhu choose the path of dual magic and martial arts cultivation. In truth, how could she know that what Ye Yinzhu was currently cultivating was not dual magic and martial arts cultivation in the ordinary sense?\n\n  “Alright, let’s not talk about this for now. What happened on the competition field today? Why did that Nether Snow Soul turn traitor mid-battle?” This question was the real reason Nina had summoned Ye Yinzhu.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu smiled wryly. “I don’t know either. It was probably moved by our music.”\n\n  Nina shook her head. “That’s not right. Influencing magical beasts with music is something we Divine Music Masters are very good at; after all, most magical beasts do not have strong spiritual power. We can even use music to make some low-rank magical beasts lose their combat ability entirely. However, today you were facing a Nether Snow Soul, which has the potential to grow into a ninth-rank intelligent magical beast, and it’s an undead type at that. The harm our music can do to it is minimal. Even if you could affect its emotions, it’s impossible to control it to the point of turning on its master!”\n\n  Ye Yinzhu subconsciously said, “Perhaps it has something to do with the piece we chose today, *The Ethereal Maiden's Soul*.”\n\n  Nina’s eyes lit up. “The piece *The Ethereal Maiden's Soul*, and the undead-type Nether Snow Soul. The connection there… It seems our Divine Music Department has a new topic to research. I need to think about this carefully. If every Divine Music Master in the future could make their opponent's magical beast turn traitor mid-battle, then, even when facing Dragon Riders…” At this thought, she couldn't help but dance with excitement, her eyes shining brightly, bearing a striking resemblance to Xue Ling from just a moment ago.\n\n  “Alright, Yinzhu, you can go back and rest for now. Recover your spiritual power properly; you still have a match tomorrow.” Having found a new goal, Director Nina immediately stopped paying attention to Ye Yinzhu, becoming completely immersed in her own excited thoughts.\n\n  After leaving Nina's office, Ye Yinzhu didn't return to the classroom. The recent victory had the entire Divine Music Department in a state of excitement, but everyone had overlooked Ye Yinzhu's exhaustion. As the main force, he had single-handedly blocked the combined attacks of five opponents plus one Nether Snow Soul. The drain on his Dou Qi and spiritual power was immense. If not for the incredibly solid foundation he had built by cultivating the Pure Zither Heart since childhood, he likely wouldn't have been able to hold on. Especially since his final, fully charged attack was never released, the elemental backlash had already caused him a certain degree of injury. A feeling of weakness was now pulsing through his brain. Thus, as soon as he left Nina’s office, Ye Yinzhu started walking outside, needing to get back to his dormitory to rest.\n\n  “Yinzhu.” Just as he stepped out of the Divine Music Master's academic building, Ye Yinzhu heard someone call his name.\n\n  Su La had appeared out of nowhere. His face looked a little pale, and his gaze towards Ye Yinzhu was somewhat strange.\n\n  “Su La, what’s wrong with you? Are you not feeling well?” Ye Yinzhu forced himself to stay alert and reached out to touch Su La’s forehead.\n\n  “I’m fine.” Su La slapped Ye Yinzhu’s hand away, his voice sounding odd. “Congratulations, you guys won again.”\n\n  Ye Yinzhu gave a wry smile. “Nothing to congratulate. Actually, luck played a huge part. Su La, you don’t look well.”\n\n  Su La said, gritting his teeth, “How could I look well? Ye Yinzhu, I’m going to kill you.” His small, thin body instantly erupted with astonishing speed. The two were already close, and Ye Yinzhu’s reaction time was greatly reduced due to his exhaustion. Before he could react, Su La’s hands were already wrapped around his neck. Because of their height difference, Su La's entire body was now hanging off of Ye Yinzhu.\n\n  A cold, slick feeling came from his neck. Su La's hands were very cold. Although he looked fierce, he wasn't actually using any force.\n\n  “Su La, what are you doing?” Yinzhu exclaimed in surprise.\n\n  Su La’s eyes were filled with a complex light, even glistening with a layer of mist. He abruptly let go of Ye Yinzhu. “You… I hate you so much. Why did your Divine Music Department have to win? Why…”\n\n  “I…” Su La's sudden release made Ye Yinzhu feel as if the sky and earth were spinning. The excessive exertion and elemental backlash finally took their toll. His vision went black, and his body pitched forward.\n\n  Su La, whose mind was deeply troubled by another matter, cried out in alarm when he saw Ye Yinzhu falling toward him. Before he could react, Ye Yinzhu had already collided with him. Out of a subconscious instinct for self-preservation, Ye Yinzhu had extended his hands forward as he fell, trying to grab something to support himself. When he crashed into Su La, his right hand happened to land on Su La’s chest. His palm tightened, and he used Su La to prop up his body.\n\n  “Su La, turns out your pecs are pretty solid too.” This was the last sentence Ye Yinzhu said before he passed out.\n\n  Supporting Ye Yinzhu’s body, Su La’s face flushed red then turned deathly pale. The pitch-black dagger had reappeared in his hand at some unknown point. Looking at Ye Yinzhu’s hand, which was still grabbing his chest, he hesitated for a long time but was still unable to thrust the dagger forward.\n\n  ...\n\n  The Far Northern Wasteland occupied more than a quarter of the Longqinus Continent's area. Located in the northernmost part of the continent, it was bitterly cold all year round. The southern border of the Far Northern Wasteland abutted the Ascoli Kingdom to its southwest, the Milan Empire directly to its south, and the Foro Kingdom to its southeast. To defend against the beastmen of the Far Northern Wasteland, the human nations had stationed heavy troops along the frontier. Likewise, the beastmen tribes were constantly on guard against human invasion, and so they had built three fortresses at the borders with these three nations. They were Solomon Fortress, bordering the Ascoli Kingdom; Thor's Hammer Fortress, bordering the Milan Empire; and the War God Fortress, bordering the Foro Kingdom.\n\n  In the eyes of humans, the beastmen were savages, barbarians of impure blood. But in truth, although the average beastman's intelligence was low, the intelligence of high-ranking beastmen was in no way inferior to that of humans. This could be seen from the fact that most beastman nobles had appearances extremely similar to humans.\n\n  Zi stood on a small hill five miles away from Thor's Hammer Fortress, gazing at the fortress walls, which were a full twenty *zhang*¹ high, his eyes radiating an icy light. His hands gripped a heavy iron staff, supporting his body. He had been standing here for a full hour without moving.\n\n  “Ten years. I never thought I’d see the day I returned to Thor's Hammer. You never imagined it, did you? The child you hunted down back then has returned. From the far north to the far south, and from the far south back to the far north, Zi’s fury will finally melt the ice and snow of the Far Northern Wasteland.”\n\n  Two intimidating beams of light shot out from Zi’s eyes. The muscles on his arms suddenly swelled, veins bulging. No one would doubt that they were a pair of arms filled with explosive power.\n\n***\n\n¹A *zhang* is a traditional Chinese unit of length, roughly 3.33 meters or about 11 feet. Twenty *zhang* is over 200 feet high.",

To my dear readers, please bookmark, recommend, and send your monthly tickets to Sheng Xiao.¹ Thank you.\n\n————————————————————————————\n\nJust then, the gates of the Fortress of Thor's Hammer suddenly opened, and the earth began to tremble. One after another, enormous figures appeared outside the fortress gates. Seeing them, a scorching flame erupted in Zi's deep purple eyes, and his grip on the heavy iron staff tightened.\n\nThey were giants, each over fifteen meters tall, their bodies covered in iron-gray fur that shimmered in the sunlight. Most astonishing was the incomparably domineering aura they released; even the magical elements in the air seemed to flee from them in terror.\n\nTheir massive feet, a meter long, made the ground shake violently with every step. Every part of their bodies was immense, especially their red eyes, which were filled with a bloodthirsty light. Their shoulders were five meters wide, the deltoid muscles on either side bulging like small hills. The muscles hidden beneath their fur could only be described as terrifying. At the end of their thick arms, their hundred-inch-long claws could each rival the lances of a human kingdom's Dragon Riders. With every low, heavy breath, the air itself seemed to whimper.\n\nThat's right, these were the ace of aces of the Beastman race, capable of contending with true dragons, the undisputed champions of land warfare—the Behemoths.\n\nEven a dragon's physical body could not compare to a Behemoth's. In a purely physical fight, these seventh-rank Berserk Behemoths could tear an eighth-rank dragon to shreds. Though they were only seventh-rank, no magical beast of the same rank was their match. Their high magic resistance made them completely immune to Blue-rank magic and below, rendering their bodies as sturdy as fortresses. As for the eighth-rank Silver Behemoths and ninth-rank Golden Behemoths, they were the very symbols of invincibility on land.\n\nThe Beastmen of the Far Northern Wasteland were divided into many tribes. The strength of a tribe was not determined by its territory, but by the number of Behemoths it possessed. The tribe with the most Behemoths was the strongest among the Beastmen.\n\nAt this moment, a full hundred Berserk Behemoths appeared outside the Fortress of Thor's Hammer. Their formation was not orderly, because Behemoths never needed formations. They had not appeared for battle, but for training. Even within the Fortress of Thor's Hammer, the greatest Beastman stronghold, the commander did not dare let these incomparably ferocious behemoths train inside the fortress walls.\n\nIn addition to the hundred Berserk Behemoths, there were also five Silver Behemoths and two Golden Behemoths. This was more than half of all the Behemoths stationed at the Fortress of Thor's Hammer.\n\nThe Silver Behemoths' fur was silver, and their bodies were even more robust than those of the Berserk Behemoths. They were immune to almost all Blue-rank magic; only Purple-rank magic could harm them. The Golden Behemoths were even more fearsome. Known as the kings of Behemoths, these super-beasts were absolute ninth-rank powerhouses. Even Purple-rank magic, if it wasn't at least third-tier, couldn't hope to inflict the slightest bit of damage on them. Their golden fur was tougher than any armor, and their bloodthirsty gaze was enough to make a dragon tremble.\n\nIt was precisely because of the existence of the Behemoths that the human kingdoms dared not overstep their bounds by a single step.\n\nOver a hundred drakes of the fourth to sixth ranks, captured by the Beastman nation from who-knows-where, were released. Terror filled the air outside the Fortress of Thor's Hammer. Atop the fortress walls, countless powerful Beastman soldiers roared wildly, cheering for their kings.\n\nDragon's blood was the best thing to keep a Behemoth in its berserk state. The Berserk Behemoths moved. Their incredibly powerful bodies showed no signs of clumsiness. A single leap could reach the height of the fortress walls. Those drakes that tried to fly were almost instantly snatched back to the ground by the Behemoths' claws and torn to pieces.\n\nThe Behemoths' method of attack was simple: power. Absolute, bloody power.\n\nNo drake could resist, and none could escape. Five minutes. It took only five minutes. The area outside the Fortress of Thor's Hammer was already a bloodbath. The drakes were gone; not even a complete piece of flesh could be found. Blood soaked the iron-gray fur of the Berserk Behemoths, and the red light in their eyes grew even stronger.\n\nJust then, the five Silver Behemoths and two Golden Behemoths joined the fray, their targets being their own kin. The massive bodies of the Berserk Behemoths were sent flying like cannonballs by these seven even mightier beasts. The frenzied roars seemed to tear the very air apart.\n\nZi stood there the entire time, watching the Behemoths fight in the distance. He knew this was how they trained. Even in practice, every single Behemoth went all out. Their superior defenses meant they had no fear of injury. Only through constant battle could the Behemoths maintain the formidable combat prowess that made the human kingdoms tremble.\n\nThe blood in his veins boiled. Zi knew he couldn't stay here any longer; he was already losing control of his emotions. He threw his head back and let out a roar that made the distant Behemoths simultaneously halt their fighting. His body transformed into a purple shadow and shot off toward the left side of the Fortress of Thor's Hammer, disappearing in the blink of an eye.\n\n...\n\nWhen Ye Yin Zhu awoke from his stupor, he found himself lying on his dormitory bed. The aroma of food wafted over, causing his stomach to groan in protest.\n\nHe rolled over and sat up. Other than a bit of dizziness, his body felt fine. Even he was surprised at how strong his recovery ability had become. The internal injuries from the elemental backlash had already healed.\n\n\"You're awake. Eat,\" Su La's somewhat cold voice sounded. Two plates of vegetable dishes and a few steamed buns were placed on the table.\n\n\"No extra dishes today?\" Ye Yin Zhu asked with a smile.\n\nSu La snorted. \"Extra dishes? You're lucky to have anything to eat.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu picked up a steamed bun and took a bite. \"Su La, what's wrong with you? I don't remember offending you. I think you even said you wanted to kill me before I passed out.\" Though he was talking, his hands weren't idle, quickly shoveling the vegetable dishes into his mouth. Su La's cooking was quite good; the taste was practically flawless.\n\n\"You ask what's wrong with me?\" Su La said through gritted teeth. \"Who told you to win? Who told you of the Divine Music Department to win? Why are you so strong? Why didn't you tell me sooner?\"\n\n\"Huh? You never asked me!\" Ye Yin Zhu said, somewhat bewildered. \"Su La, what's gotten into you? I think I heard my dad say that only people going through menopause are so emotionally unstable. Don't tell me you're starting early.\"\n\n\"You...\" Su La's face grew even darker. Suddenly, he burst into tears with a loud \"Wahhh!\" \"My money! My money! You bastard, you made me lose all my money! I—I'm going to kill you, kill you!\" As he spoke, a dagger somehow appeared in his hand again, slashing through the air as if the air were Ye Yin Zhu.\n\n\"I made you lose money? I thought you only bet one gold coin. Besides, since you bet on our Divine Music Department to win, how could you have lost?\" Ye Yin Zhu was confused.\n\n\"Well...\" The crying stopped. Su La looked at Ye Yin Zhu with an embarrassed expression and lowered his head. \"Actually, I didn't think you guys would win, so... I bet all my money on the Dark Magic Department. I was hoping to make a little extra to improve our living standards. But who knew... you guys actually won.\"\n\nHearing this, Ye Yin Zhu finally understood. He frowned and said, \"I told you gambling was a bad idea. Why do you still do it?\"\n\n---\n¹ This is a direct author's note from the original text. \"Sheng Xiao\" is likely the author's name or pen name.",

Thank you.\n\n————————————————————————————\n\nSula snorted. \"I don't care. I lost all our money, and this is our last meal. After this, we won't even have money for groceries. You made me lose it, so you have to pay me back.\"\n\nLooking at Sula's tear-streaked face, Ye Yinzhu didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He sighed softly, and with a faint glow from the space ring on his hand, the last few gold coins he had left appeared in his palm. \"You can have it all. This is everything I have.\"\n\nSula was stunned. He never expected that not only would Ye Yinzhu not blame him for losing all their money, but he would even give him what little he had left. He didn't even say a single word of reproach.\n\nTaking the gold coins, Sula slowly lowered his head. A subtle change came over his expression, and his gaze, without him realizing it, had completely softened.\n\n\"Hurry up and eat. Don't gamble next time. These few gold coins should be enough for us for a few days, right?\" Ye Yinzhu took the initiative to place a steamed bun in Sula's hand and pulled him down to sit opposite him.\n\nStaring at the steamed bun in his hand, Sula didn't move for a long time.\n\n\"Yinzhu.\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"You're a good person,\" Sula sighed.\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled slightly. \"I think so too.\"\n\nSula said with a wry smile, \"But how are we going to live from now on? Everything in Milan is so expensive. This much money will only feed us for a little over a month at most. I lost dozens of gold coins! Dozens of them!\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said helplessly, \"I don't know what to do about that either. I'll try my best to win the freshmen tournament. We'll have money then.\"\n\nSula snorted and said, \"You think it's that easy? You've seen the strength of the Dark Magic Department, but among the nine magic departments—oh, counting your Divine Music Department, it's ten now—the Dark Magic Department can only rank third or fourth at best. The Wind, Space, and Light Departments are no weaker than them. And the Spirit and Summoning Departments are definitely stronger. Miracles don't happen all the time. Even if your Divine Music Department has some strength, you might not be able to keep winning in the upcoming matches.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said, \"I have confidence in myself.\"\n\nSula shot him a sideways glance. \"But I don't have confidence in you guys.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu forced a smile. \"Then what should we do? It's not like gold coins are going to fall from the sky.\"\n\nSula's eyes suddenly lit up. \"Yinzhu, why don't we go out and find jobs? The Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts focuses more on self-study for its students; we only have classes three days a week. We can use our free time to work. As long as we find a decent job, it will be enough to cover our expenses at the academy. Don't forget, we still have to pay tuition next semester. A year's tuition is a hundred gold coins! That's no small sum.\"\n\nThe mention of tuition made Ye Yinzhu think of Hai Yang. He nodded and said, \"Alright. So what should we do?\"\n\nSula shook his head. \"I don't know either. How about this: you still have to compete, and I have nothing to do anyway. I'll go look around these next few days. If I find a suitable job, I'll take you with me.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu nodded. \"Okay.\"\n\nSula chuckled. \"However, from now on, I'll be in charge of our wages. To keep you from spending recklessly. You're such a spendthrift.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu looked at him, speechless, thinking to himself, *Weren't you the one who just lost all our savings?* Although he thought this, he didn't say it out loud, instead agreeing to Sula's demand. To him, money wasn't that important. Having food to eat and a place to live was enough.\n\nWhen the tournament resumed the next day, a beautiful new spectacle appeared at the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts. Eighty-one students from all five years of the Divine Music Department had formed a super cheerleading squad and appeared early at the edge of the competition grounds.\n\nPerhaps the Divine Music Department wasn't a favorite to win the championship, but they were definitely number one in popularity. Such was the power of the top department at the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts. Compared to the Divine Music Department's area, the audience at the other competition grounds could only be described as a mere handful. Even if the students and teachers who came to watch the Divine Music Department's matches weren't optimistic about them and didn't care about the results, coming to see the beauties was always a good thing.\n\nEighty-one beauties from the Divine Music Department! Even if not every single one was a peerless stunner, at least half of them could be called beautiful, with quite a few exceptional ones among them. Add to that their certainly noble backgrounds, and who wouldn't hope to catch the eye of these young ladies? Coming to watch the Divine Music Department's matches was, at the very least, a feast for the eyes. After all, this was the first time all the students from the Divine Music Department had acted together as a group.\n\nFrom this day forward, before every Divine Music Department match, a row of bright-eyed, white-toothed young women in white miniskirts and small blue blouses could be seen in the best seats of the practice grounds. Their clear, moving, and alluring voices would shout, \"Victory to the Divine Music Department!\"\n\nIt was hard to say whether it was because the Divine Music freshmen were genuinely powerful or because the cheerleading squad boosted their morale, but in the following two days of competition, the Divine Music Department won three consecutive matches, defeating the Earth, Fire, and Light Departments. Only the match against the Light Department gave them some trouble. However, the Light Department's leader did not possess a growth-type magical beast like the Dark Magic Department's Yue Ming. Though he was also a high-tier Yellow Rank, he was still unable to break through Ye Yinzhu's defense of Sonic Blades and the Aegis of the Moon God, and fell to the ensemble piece of the five Divine Music students. For a time, the Divine Music Department, with a five-win, zero-loss record, was tied for first place in the magic division's freshmen tournament with the Spirit and Summoning Departments. Next, the opponent they had to face was the Wind Department, led by the genius magic girl Roland, who had challenged Ye Yinzhu during freshman registration.\n\nSitting in the stands, Dean Nina looked somewhat haggard, her brow furrowed. Even though the Divine Music Department had won three straight matches in the past two days, she had yet to crack a smile.\n\n*Why won't it work? My magical power is clearly much stronger than that kid Ye Yinzhu's, but why can't my xiao music control my opponent's magical beast? Was he just lucky that day?*\n\n\"What is Dean Nina thinking about? The match is about to begin.\" A gentle voice rang out, pulling Nina back from her thoughts. Looking up, she saw that Headmaster Ferguson had appeared by her side at some point. Perhaps because the Divine Music Department had emerged as a dark horse this time, Ferguson had not missed a single one of their matches, always watching quietly before leaving just as silently.\n\n\"Hello, Headmaster. I was just thinking about some issues with the musical pieces,\" Nina replied faintly.\n\nFerguson smiled. \"The Divine Music Department's matches have truly been an eye-opener. It's a pity that it's so difficult for Divine Musicians to advance in rank. Otherwise, in any battle, they would be able to inflict heavy damage on their opponents.\" Indeed, the biggest problem plaguing the Divine Music Department wasn't the duration of their musical pieces, but the difficulty of their training. A Divine Musician's magical power could only be improved by training while performing music, which was far more difficult than the simple meditation of ordinary mages. Otherwise, a teacher with a rank as low as Bi Ji's would not exist. In the Divine Music Department's five-year program, students could graduate simply by reaching the Orange Rank, a much lower requirement than the other magic departments.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\">Qidian Chinese Network</a> welcomes all readers to visit and read.

    "content": "To my fellow readers, please add this book to your favorites, recommend it, and give your monthly tickets to Zodiac. Thank you.\n\n————————————————————————————\n\nNina sighed softly. \"From the Yellow Rank onwards, a Divine Music Master's strength can only be improved through talent. Without talent, no amount of effort is of any use. Otherwise, it wouldn't be called the most chicken-rib¹ profession. But I've always believed that Divine Music Masters can become the most powerful magicians on the continent. One day, beyond the Seven Towers of Falan, there will be an eighth—a Tower of Divine Music.\"\n\nFerguson was startled and shot Nina a look. \"Praise Falan, Director Nina, do not say such things again.\"\n\nNina realized her slip of the tongue, and her heart went cold. She said no more.\n\nFerguson's gaze shifted to the Divine Music Department's cheerleading squad below the stage. The expanse of pale, lovely thighs made him swallow subconsciously. In truth, though he was no longer young, looking at the delightful beauties of the Divine Music Department made even him a little envious of the youth of today.\n\n\"Ye Yinzhu, you can do it! Our Divine Music Department is the strongest!\" A voice as smooth and lustrous as a pearl rang out from the front of the Divine Music cheerleading squad. A young woman waved the specially made pom-poms in her hands, shouting with excitement. If there were over five thousand men in the entire audience, then at least ninety-five percent of them had their eyes fixed on this girl. Of those, more than seventy percent were swallowing hard, their eyes gleaming.\n\nAs the captain of the Divine Music cheerleading squad, Xiang Luan, the number one beauty of the Milan Magic and Martial Academy, certainly had the capital to command such attention.\n\nXiang Luan was not her name but her title. No one knew her real name; even in the academy's student records, her name was listed as Xiang Luan. Xiang Luan was the name of a flower, a symbol of happiness. It appeared serene, harmonious, and elegant, embodying the free, optimistic, and upright spirit of the Milan Empire. It was the national flower of the Milan Empire. The people of Milan loved it, also calling it the Golden Lily.\n\nHearing that voice again, Ye Yinzhu, already standing on the stage, couldn't help but turn his gaze in its direction. Although this wasn't the first time he had seen Xiang Luan, the sight of her once again made his heart pound.\n\nDressed in the same white skirt and blue top, the uniform took on an ethereal beauty when worn by Xiang Luan. She was about 1.7 meters tall, her body a perfect golden ratio, with a portion of her long, shapely legs exposed. Her shimmering pink-gold hair cascaded down her back in large waves. Her clear, pale purple eyes shimmered with light. When she moved, she was as graceful as a startled swan, as supple as a swimming dragon. As glorious as an autumn chrysanthemum, as vibrant as a spring pine. She seemed at times like a light cloud veiling the moon, at others like swirling snow swept by the wind. Viewed from afar, she was as radiant as the sun rising through morning clouds. Examined up close, she was as brilliant as a lotus blossom emerging from the green waves. Her moving beauty was such that no one could look away after the first glance. The other beauties of the Divine Music Department stood behind her, but all their radiance combined could not match hers alone.\n\nThe first time he saw Xiang Luan, Ye Yinzhu's mind went completely blank. He had seen many beauties in the Divine Music Department, but only Xiang Luan could make his heart race and his face flush. The feeling she gave him was entirely different; her face seemed to be imprinted upon the very depths of his heart.\n\nAt this moment, their eyes met, and Ye Yinzhu once again saw Xiang Luan's encouraging gaze. Unconsciously, his entire body felt filled with inexhaustible strength and boundless, surging confidence. *She's looking at me. Is she encouraging me? I must win. I must keep winning with the Divine Music Department.*\n\n\"Hey, stop staring. Haven't you had enough?\" Xue Ling's reproachful voice snapped Ye Yinzhu out of his daze. \"Ah! I…\" The innocent boy couldn't help but feel his face burn.\n\nXue Ling huffed and leaned close to Ye Yinzhu, whispering, \"Stop looking, it's useless. Do you know how many people in our academy are pursuing Senior Xiang Luan? Putting aside everything else, even if she did take a liking to you, you wouldn't be able to handle it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Ye Yinzhu asked subconsciously.\n\nXue Ling said, \"Do you want to become the public enemy of the entire academy? The match is about to start. Focus.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu took a deep breath, tore his eyes away from Xiang Luan's direction, and composed himself, turning to face his opponents. He saw Roland again. Today, she was wearing the Milan Magic and Martial Academy uniform. Although she was also beautiful, Ye Yinzhu, having seen the peerless Xiang Luan and the many beauties of the Divine Music Department, was practically immune to her. His original reason for participating in the freshman tournament was to prove himself, and Roland could be considered the instigator.\n\nAs the captain of the Wind Department, Roland's expression was somewhat grim. She truly hadn't expected Ye Yinzhu to actually lead the Divine Music Department into the competition, much less achieve a winning streak.\n\n\"Roland, we meet again.\" As the captain of the Divine Music Department, Ye Yinzhu walked up to Roland.\n\nRoland snorted coldly. \"I didn't expect a poor boy like you to have some skill. However, your winning streak ends here. I will personally show you what true magic and true strength are.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu had learned a lot during his time at the academy. Coupled with his peaceful nature and his upbringing steeped in music, his mentality and temperament were one in ten thousand. He was no longer so easily provoked. He smiled faintly and said, \"Then let's begin. We choose the group battle.\" He wouldn't argue; proving it with facts was the best choice.\n\nAside from Roland, the other four participating students from the Wind Department were all male. The moment the referee announced the official start of the match, five yellow glows lit up simultaneously. Following the Dark Magic and Light Magic Departments, the Divine Music Department once again faced a team where all five contestants were Yellow-ranked.\n\nRoland and three other students were at the initial stage of the Yellow Rank, while the one second-year student had even reached the high stage of the Wind element. Wind magic wasn't the strongest in terms of attack, but it was absolutely the fastest. Ear-piercing shrieks tore through the air in the first instant as dozens of crimson wind blades shot out from the five magic staves, flying towards Ye Yinzhu's team like a dense cloud.\n\nA milky-white light glowed as the familiar Moon God's Protection quietly appeared, shielding the five of them. The ensemble piece they had chosen for today was titled \"White Snow.\" It was, once again, a piece filled with sorrow. For Divine Music Masters, sorrowful music was the easiest to evoke empathy with, and thus the easiest to use their spiritual power to control their opponents' emotions. Given that their magic levels were generally lower than those of other departments, Nina had arranged for all their competition pieces to be primarily sorrowful.\n\nTo defend against the opponent's attack, Ye Yinzhu was on high alert. \"White Snow\" began with Hai Yang's guzheng. Just as the clear notes of the zither had begun to sound, the wind blades rushing toward them suddenly changed. When the dozens of wind blades were still several meters away, they abruptly changed direction and began to collide with one another rapidly. A series of harsh screeches instantly disrupted the rhythm of the music. Hai Yang's hands faltered, and \"White Snow\" was forcefully interrupted in an instant.\n\nThe faces of Xue Ling, Lan Xi, and Kong Que changed simultaneously. Their music was the Divine Music Department's only key to victory. To have it interrupted by the howling wind right at the start was clearly not a good sign.\n\nThe process of the wind blades colliding in mid-air didn't stop. The piercing screeches sounded one after another. Except for Roland and the high-stage Yellow-ranked Wind student, the remaining three continuously cast wind blades. They didn't attack the Moon God's Protection, but instead had the blades constantly collide with each other around the shield, using the sound generated by the violent friction to block out the ensemble music of the four girls from the Divine Music Department.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Chicken-rib:** A Chinese idiom, literally meaning \"chicken rib.\" It refers to something that is of little value or taste, yet one is reluctant to discard it.

    "content": "Here is today's second chapter. Please add it to your collection and vote for it. Hehe.\n\n————————————————————————-\n\nHai Yang was faring a little better. After the initial surprise of being interrupted, her expression remained icy cold. The sound of her zither, though slowed, was not chaotic; she managed to continue playing the melody of \"White Snow.\" But Xue Ling, Lan Xi, and Kong Que could not do the same. Their spiritual energy was far less stable than Hai Yang's, and under the influence of the Wind Howl, their playing was completely unable to form a melody. Instead, their wrong notes were, to a certain extent, affecting Hai Yang's performance. The match had just begun, and the Divine Music Department was already at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nLuo Lan shot Ye Yin Zhu a provocative glance. Although Hai Yang could still produce a melody, under the effect of the Wind Howl, its impact on these Yellow-ranked magicians was pitifully small, not nearly enough to disrupt their spell incantations. Luo Lan and the second-year student beside her had already begun a low, lengthy chant.\n\nYe Yin Zhu sat there, motionless, paying no mind to the clashing wind blades outside. His gaze remained fixed on Luo Lan, as if waiting for something.\n\nAs the low chanting grew faster, Luo Lan and the other student released a strong yellow light. The deep yellow glow from the second-year student was especially dense, and a faint, six-pointed magical star pattern had begun to materialize before them.\n\nA faint smile appeared on Ye Yin Zhu's face, as if the outside world had nothing to do with him. At this moment, his eyes saw only the Sea Moon's Pure Brilliance Zither before him. He lifted his right hand slightly, his four fingers flicking lightly, striking the strings in an instant with the force of a falcon's swift strike. A series of deep, humming notes suddenly rang out, shaking one to the core like the morning bell and evening drum. Burst Sound—it was Ye Yin Zhu's signature instant-cast Burst Sound, one that combined with his Dou Qi. A dark red magical fluctuation surged in an instant, and in that same moment, the endlessly clashing wind blades stopped. The five Wind Department contestants, including Luo Lan, all shuddered violently.\n\nUnlike the Burst Sound he used against the Dark Magic Department last time, this time, Ye Yin Zhu used a continuous Burst Sound. One should not underestimate that simple strum; it was something he had been building up from the very beginning. The ultimate form of Burst Sound, produced only when his *jing, qi, and shen*¹ were raised to their absolute peak and his Dou Qi and spiritual energy were perfectly fused: a Seven-Note Continuous Burst. Its power as an attack on spiritual energy was no less than any Yellow-ranked psychic magic.\n\nWhen is a Burst Sound most effective? Qin Shang had once explained this principle to Ye Yin Zhu in detail. No matter the school of magic, once a spell's incantation is more than halfway complete, it cannot be stopped. It's just like a zither piece played with the urging of Zither Magic; once past the halfway point, it must be played to completion, or one risks a spiritual energy backlash.\n\nObviously, a Burst Sound is most effective when unleashed after the opponent's spell is more than halfway chanted. Forcibly interrupting an already activated spell causes immense harm to a magician. If the opponent won't interrupt their own spell, use Burst Sound to help them. This way, the elemental backlash alone can easily wound the opponent, placing oneself in an invincible position. Of course, Burst Sound is ultimately only slightly more advanced than ordinary instant-cast magic. Therefore, if the opponent's spiritual energy is firm enough, disrupting their chant with a Burst Sound is not so easy.\n\nYe Yin Zhu was very confident in himself, especially in his Dou Qi-enhanced Burst Sound. But his opponent, after all, included a high-tier Yellow-ranked magician, so he used the Seven-Note Continuous Burst for the first time. The power generated by seven Burst Sounds linked as one was far more than the simple sum of seven. The stacking effect instantly destroyed the incantations of Luo Lan and the high-tier Yellow-ranked student.\n\nTheir spells were interrupted. The expressions of Luo Lan and the other student changed drastically. A ball of pale green light shone from within the lapels of Luo Lan's chest, flashing once before vanishing. An intense magical fluctuation made Luo Lan's body tremble once more before she revealed a look of relief. Evidently, she also possessed a magical item akin to a Mind Guard, which had helped her diffuse the elemental backlash at the critical moment. However, the second-year student wasn't so lucky. The intense backlash of wind magic instantly caused the yellow magical light around his body to fluctuate violently, as if crashing into itself. With a miserable cry, he spat out a mouthful of blood and crumpled to the ground.\n\nThe other three wind magicians now felt only a constant ringing in their ears, their minds a complete blank. For a time, they too had lost their ability to fight.\n\nThe first use of the Seven-Note Continuous Burst had achieved an unexpected effect. At this moment, although Luo Lan was still conscious, the contempt in her eyes had completely vanished. She now fully understood that the Divine Music Department's five-game winning streak was by no means due to luck. And Ye Yin Zhu's zither music was not so easily countered. The Wind Department's match strategy, researched specifically to counter the Divine Music Department, had been utterly shattered by the Seven-Note Continuous Burst.\n\nFerguson was becoming somewhat accustomed to the surprises Ye Yin Zhu brought. He muttered to himself in a low voice, \"Praise be to Falan, what a peculiar magical fluctuation. That blast just now definitely reached the Green rank or higher, yet he is only at the Red rank. Could it be that the effects of dual magic and martial cultivation are truly this good for a Divine Music Master?\" How could he have known that for a Divine Music Master, dual cultivation is the most difficult of all? Otherwise, Qin Shang would have cultivated it long ago. Even for someone like Ye Yin Zhu, a one-in-ten-thousand talent born with eight fingers, it still took sixteen full years of cultivating the *Chizi Qin Xin*² to achieve just these preliminary results.\n\n\"White Snow\" finally began to play smoothly. Ye Yin Zhu did not join the ensemble. He looked up at Luo Lan and said flatly, \"Surrender. You have no chance left.\" The Wind Department had lost four of its five combatants. Ye Yin Zhu, possessing the two killer magical abilities of Sound Blade and Burst Sound, would never allow the Wind Howl's influence to appear again. A lone, low-tier Yellow-ranked Luo Lan was now completely suppressed. Trying to chant amidst the music of Divine Music Masters would be even more difficult. Besides, even though a magical item had helped her diffuse the earlier elemental backlash, it had still caused a certain amount of damage to her body.\n\n\"No, I will not lose, especially not to you.\" A stubborn expression appeared on Luo Lan's pretty face. \"Appear, my partner, Fei Fei!\" A cyan six-pointed magical star appeared before her. As the cyan light flickered, Luo Lan's confidence seemed to grow infinitely. A huge, cyan figure practically squeezed its way out of the six-pointed star.\n\nFerguson and Nina exclaimed in surprise at almost the same time, \"A wind-elemental growth-type magical beast, a Green Dragon!\"\n\nFerguson smiled. \"Praise be to Falan. The children these days are getting stronger and stronger. Another growth-type magical beast has appeared. Could it be that growth-type magical beasts have become so common on the Lunqinuosi Continent? It seems our Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts is about to see its golden generation.\"\n\nNina's expression was not nearly as pleasant as Ferguson's. A Green Dragon. Not a wyvern,³ but a true dragon. Although even the strongest Green Dragon can only grow to the eighth rank, its growth potential is a bit lower than that of the Nether Snow Spirit from the other day. However, a Green Dragon is, after all, a true dragon. Its physical combat ability is not something the Nether Snow Spirit can compare to. Only a magician who possesses a true dragon as a mount can be called a Dragon Magician. This is completely different from a Dragon Knight. Clearly, Luo Lan was a Dragon Magician. Even if her Green Dragon was currently only a fifth-rank adolescent whose intelligence had not yet awakened.\n\nSeven meters long and three meters tall, the Green Dragon's body looked distinctly bloated. Perhaps because it had eaten too many good things, it was chubby and looked extremely cute. As soon as it appeared, it patted its own head with both front claws and turned to look for Luo Lan.\n\n\"Fei Fei, attack! Defeat them for me, or you get no dinner tonight!\" Luo Lan furiously commanded.\n\nFei Fei turned around and finally looked at the five members of Ye Yin Zhu's group, who were much smaller than it. Its previously simple and honest gaze immediately turned fierce. It gestured with its front claws, as if to say, \"For dinner, I'll give it my all!\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Jing, Qi, and Shen (精氣神):** The \"Three Treasures\" in traditional Chinese philosophy and medicine, representing essence, vital energy, and spirit.

    "content": "Here is the third chapter for today. Please add it to your collections and vote. Hehe.\n\n————————————————————————-\n\nThis was the first time Ye Yin Zhu had ever faced a real dragon. Its green body was covered in a layer of fine scales, and its plump figure was charmingly naive. At seven meters long, it was far less ferocious than the Gold Crystal Tyrannosaurus Rex he had seen. Watching its sluggish movements, it was hard to imagine it could pose any threat. However, this time, he had completely misjudged.\n\nA pair of enormous wings unfurled from its back. Feifei’s previously clumsy body instantly accelerated. Despite its massive size, it actually left an afterimage in mid-air. In the blink of an eye, it was in front of Ye Yin Zhu’s Moon God’s Aegis. With tremendous force, its huge body slammed directly into the shield. How could a wind-attribute dragon, even if a bit fat, possibly be slow?\n\n*Boom—* How much force can a body three meters tall and seven meters long generate after instant acceleration? Feifei showed Ye Yin Zhu the answer. The Moon God’s Aegis almost instantaneously shattered into specks of white light, completely disintegrating under Feifei’s powerful impact. Fortunately, the Moon God’s Aegis, created by Ye Yin Zhu’s spiritual energy, was comparable in power to a Green-rank defensive spell. Although it was destroyed, it managed to slow Feifei’s body for a moment, preventing him from being directly hit by this mountain of flesh.\n\nFrom a distance, Luo Lan shouted, \"Wind Blade Breath!\"\n\n\"Don't!\" Nina cried out, but it was already too late.\n\nA ball of green gales spewed from Feifei’s mouth—a tempest composed of countless wind blades. Breath was an innate ability of dragons, and the breath of different dragon species varied. Feifei’s Green-rank Wind Blade Breath was clearly worlds apart from the wind blades the Wind Department students had previously cast. Without the Moon God’s Aegis, the green wind blades swarmed uniformly toward Ye Yin Zhu’s group of five in a mere instant. At this point, Ye Yin Zhu had no time to mobilize his spiritual energy to cast the Moon God’s Aegis again.\n\nWhat is the outcome when a mage is approached by a dragon with powerful melee and magical abilities?\n\nThe cheerleading squad from the Divine Music Department, who were watching the battle, had fallen completely silent. Most of the girls had closed their eyes, unable to watch any longer. Even the referee and the teachers observing from outside couldn't possibly intervene in that split second. No one had expected such a powerful dragon to suddenly enter the match. Feifei was simply too close to Ye Yin Zhu and the others. As they watched the vast sheet of Green-rank wind blades fly madly toward them, everyone held their breath.\n\nLuo Lan was also stunned, her heart filled with intense regret. Feifei had limited intelligence and relied entirely on her control. In her anger, spurred by the Seven-Note Consecutive Blast, she had forgotten how terrifying dragons could be. Seeing Ye Yin Zhu, who was bearing the brunt of the attack, about to be annihilated by Feifei's wind blades, it was too late for her to stop it.\n\nThe performance of *White Snow* had become meaningless. Xue Ling was dumbfounded. Lan Xi watched the approaching wind blades with eyes full of terror. Kongque screamed. Hai Yang lifted her head, her hands pressed upon the zither strings. A faint despair, and even a sense of release, flickered in her cold eyes.\n\nThe violent wind from the blades blew Hai Yang’s black hair aside, revealing the half of her face that had always been hidden. It was a withered visage. Her right cheek looked as if it were covered by a large scar, forming an extremely stark contrast with her left cheek, whose beauty was no less than Xiang Luan's. At this moment, facing the destructive Green-rank wind blades, Hai Yang's secret was finally exposed. If Xiang Luan was the number one beauty of the Divine Music Department, then she was its number one ugliest girl.\n\nYe Yin Zhu did not panic, nor would he despair. As the green wind blades blotted out the sky and shot toward him, he moved. This time, it wasn't the vibration of the zither strings, but his hand—his right hand, with only four fingers.\n\nA jade-colored brilliance instantly extended to a length of three *zhang*.[^1] The light swirled in the air, and a circular, jade-colored ripple drifted out. In that instant, the wind blades unleashed by the green dragon Feifei were completely enveloped within that jade-colored radiance. The circular jade ripple pulsed violently. Ye Yin Zhu let out a muffled grunt, and his body shuddered fiercely from the blast of energy.\n\nCoughing up a mouthful of blood, Ye Yin Zhu did not retreat. His determined gaze locked onto the behemoth before him as he charged toward Feifei. With phantom-like steps, his body dodged Feifei's striking foreclaw at the last possible moment. He shot up like an arrow, and in the blink of an eye, he was already behind Feifei. That jade-colored brilliance, a soft circular ripple, quietly looped around Feifei’s thick neck.\n\nOnly then did those with sharp eyes see that what had emerged from Ye Yin Zhu’s right hand was a jade-colored silk thread. It was now flashing with an intense yellow light, cinched tightly around Feifei’s neck.\n\nBlood spurted out. Feifei cried out in pain. The seemingly delicate jade-colored thread had actually cut into its sturdy scales. Ye Yin Zhu pressed himself tightly against its back, pulling with both hands, causing the jade-colored thread to constantly tighten.\n\nEnraged by the sharp pain in its neck, Feifei roared furiously. Its massive body soared into the air, struggling and thrashing, trying to throw Ye Yin Zhu off. But its efforts were in vain. The jade silk thread coiled around its neck grew tighter and tighter, the pain more and more intense. Large drops of dragon blood streamed down its thick neck, but Ye Yin Zhu's body seemed to be glued to it, impossible to shake off. Taking off abruptly, its body slammed heavily against the barrier at the top of the proving ground. Ye Yin Zhu coughed up another mouthful of blood, but his grip on the jade silk thread only tightened.\n\n\"Recall your dragon and admit defeat. Otherwise, I will have to kill it,\" Ye Yin Zhu's somewhat cold voice echoed throughout the arena.\n\nThe sudden turn of events had occurred in the space of a few breaths. Very few people had been able to clearly see Ye Yin Zhu's movements.\n\nLuo Lan clearly felt the green dragon Feifei's intense pain. Although she desperately wanted to win this match, Feifei was more important to her. With almost no hesitation, the six-pointed star appeared once more, recalling her precious dragon.\n\nYe Yin Zhu's slender body drifted down from the sky. He flipped once in mid-air, and the three-*zhang*-long jade silk thread in his hand lashed out like a whip, imbued with the Dou Qi of the Second Yellow Bamboo Rank. It struck the ground, slowing his descent before he landed. The jade silk thread retracted into ripples, disappearing into the sleeve of his right wrist. By now, his face was as pale as paper, yet he stood there unswervingly, his pride like bamboo.\n\nThe Wind Department had lost. Luo Lan had lost, too. In both the match and in spirit, she had been completely defeated by Ye Yin Zhu.\n\n\"The Divine Music Department wins.\" The referee ended the match, his heart still pounding violently. The scene just now, where the five students from the Divine Music Department were nearly killed by the green dragon’s wind blades, had chilled him to the bone. One must know, most of these girls from the Divine Music Department came from extraordinary backgrounds. If something were to happen to them, it would be a major disaster for the entire Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts!\n\n***\n\n[^1]: A *zhang* is a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters or about 11 feet.

In this new year, I wish you all joyous families, success in your studies, and smooth sailing at work.\n\n———————————————-\n\nLuo Lan and the now-conscious Wind Element student participant departed dejectedly. At this moment, she didn't even dare to look into Ye Yinzhu's clear eyes.\n\nStanding there, Ye Yinzhu's gaze found the stunned Xiang Luan among the cheerleading squad. A faint smile touched the corners of his mouth, as if to say to her, *I won. The Divine Music Department won.*\n\n\"Yinzhu.\" Xue Ling was the first to run up, followed by Lan Xi, Kong Que, and Hai Yang. At this moment, Hai Yang's black hair once again hung down, covering the atrophied half of her face. Her complexion was terrible, deathly pale without a trace of color.\n\nYe Yinzhu looked at the four girls. \"We won. I said I would block all the attacks for you, and I did. *Wah*—\" Spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood, Ye Yinzhu's body collapsed towards Hai Yang.\n\nStartled, Hai Yang subconsciously caught Ye Yinzhu's body. The faint scent of blood and the unique smell of a man assailed her nostrils. A blush immediately appeared on her originally pale face, and for a moment, she was at a loss, not knowing what to do.\n\n…\n\nIn a daze, Ye Yinzhu seemed to see everything inside his own body: the meridians, blood, and internal organs were all before his eyes.\n\n*Huh, why can I see all this?* His heart was filled with doubt. Just then, his blood began to change. For some reason, the originally bright red blood turned purple, a faint purple. Soon, the purple blood had tinted everything he saw in the same color.\n\nA tingling itch spread throughout his body, as if it had seeped into his very bones. He wanted to scratch, but he couldn't do a thing. The tingling itch grew more and more intense. Wisps of heat surged within him. Itching was more tormenting than pain, completely unbearable. There wasn't a spot on his body that didn't itch. The intense agony made him struggle desperately in his mind, but unfortunately, none of this was within his control.\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, just as Ye Yinzhu felt he was about to break down, the heat transformed into a torrent, engulfing all the tingling itchiness. The surging torrent of heat felt as if his body were being boiled in magma, but this searing heat was far better than the previous itching.\n\nFinally, the torrent of heat gradually receded, and Ye Yinzhu's consciousness blurred once more. A comfortable sensation spread throughout his body as he sank deep into darkness.\n\n…\n\nA cool, damp sensation caressed his face, indescribably comfortable. With a low groan, Ye Yinzhu slowly opened his eyes.\n\n\"Praise Falan! Yinzhu, you're finally awake.\" Su La's excited voice rang out, the deep concern within it warming Ye Yinzhu's heart.\n\nThe blurriness before his eyes gradually cleared. His six senses returned one by one. Ye Yinzhu discovered he was resting his head on a thigh—a firm, springy thigh. A faint, cool, virginal fragrance stimulated his senses. Comfortable, so very comfortable. This was the best pillow he had ever used in his life. At the same time, he also realized he seemed to be hugging something soft and supple.\n\n\"Hai Yang, why is it you? Y-you, why are you here?\" Now fully awake, Ye Yinzhu stared dumbfounded at the scene before him. He found himself in an extremely ambiguous position: his head was pillowed on Hai Yang's lap, his hands were wrapped tightly around her waist, and most of his face was pressed against her lower abdomen. That alluring, cool fragrance was coming from her.\n\nHe released his hands almost instantly and shot up into a sitting position. He realized his arms and body were a bit stiff; clearly, he had been in that position for quite some time. His heart instantly sped up, beating even faster than it did when he saw Xiang Luan.\n\nHer black hair half-covered her face. With her head lowered, her expression was hidden, but the visible half of her pretty face had turned bright red.\n\nSu La stood to the side, a towel in his hand; the cool sensation on Ye Yinzhu's face had evidently come from it. He looked at Ye Yinzhu with a faint, teasing smile. \"You're asking her? You fainted at the training grounds, which is fine, but you just had to fall on Hai Yang. Then you wrapped your arms around her and refused to let go no matter what. We had no choice, so Hai Yang had to come back with you. We thought it'd be fine once we put you on the bed, but who knew you'd just hold on tighter, only in a different spot. You really used her as a pillow. It's a good thing Hai Yang is soft-hearted. If it were me, hmph hmph...\"\n\n\"Th-this...\" Ye Yinzhu didn't know what to say. His face was even redder than Hai Yang's. He lowered his head, not daring to look at the cold, half-beautiful, half-ugly girl beside him.\n\nThe blush on Hai Yang's face gradually faded, replaced by her usual coldness. Her pale, pretty face was heart-wrenching to look at. \"Are you alright now?\"\n\nOnly then did Ye Yinzhu remember that he had been gravely injured because of his fight with the green dragon Fei Fei. The green dragon's Wind Blade Breath wasn't so easy to block. In his haste, Ye Yinzhu had used his Dou Qi and a special weapon to neutralize the wind blades, but he himself had taken a huge impact. Afterward, when Fei Fei was struggling, he had been thrown against the barrier. His body had suffered two severe blows, which was why he had coughed up blood and fainted.\n\nHe moved his body a little and was surprised to find that not only was there no pain, but even his magical power and Dou Qi had recovered to about seventy or eighty percent. Moreover, his entire body now felt full of power, a surging energy that seemed ready to burst forth. It was just that his body was sticky, as if he had sweated a lot, which was a bit uncomfortable.\n\n\"I'm fine. How did I get better so quickly? Did you guys treat me after I passed out?\"\n\nSu La said, \"No. After we got you back, your whole body was alternating between hot and cold, and you kept shivering. I tried to infuse Dou Qi into you to help you heal, but I was repelled by a backlash force. Later, you started sweating constantly, and there seemed to be a purple stream of energy vibrating around your body. After about an hour of that, you finally quieted down and fell asleep hugging Hai Yang. It's already evening now. You looked pretty badly hurt then, are you really okay now?\"\n\nBefore Ye Yinzhu could speak, Hai Yang had already stood up. There was indeed a large sweat stain on her pure white dress, obviously left by Ye Yinzhu. \"Since you're fine, I'll be going. If you haven't recovered, don't compete tomorrow.\" After speaking, she turned to walk out. In that instant, Ye Yinzhu clearly saw the ugly half of her face hidden beneath her black hair.\n\n\"Hai Yang,\" Ye Yinzhu called out.\n\nHai Yang's steps faltered for a moment.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nShe shook her head gently and, without another word, drifted away. Watching Hai Yang's departing back, a plan had already formed in Ye Yinzhu's mind. He could tell that the biggest reason for Hai Yang's cold demeanor was her face, which was clearly the result of something that happened after her birth.\n\n\"Stop looking, she's gone. Yinzhu, quick, tell me, what was that weapon you used at the end of the match today? I don't think I've ever seen it before,\" Su La said, looking at him with a curious expression.\n\n\"Oh, that! That's...\" Ye Yinzhu raised his right hand...\n\n***\n\nQidian Chinese Network welcomes all book lovers to come and read.

    "content": "This is the second chapter for today, and also the last one for the day. Because of the holidays, Little San will add the closing remarks for Volume 2 in a few days. Hehe. Wishing all book friends a Happy New Year.\n\n———————————————————————————————\n\n\"Stop looking, they're already gone. Yinzhu, quick, tell me, what was that weapon you used at the end of the match today! I don't think I've ever seen it before.\" Sura looked at Ye Yinzhu with a curious expression.\n\n\"That! That's...\" Ye Yinzhu raised his right hand and pulled up his sleeve. A jade-green bracelet on his wrist shimmered with a soft light. Unlike the Life-Guarding Bracelet which was completely flush against his skin, this jade-green bracelet was simply worn on his wrist.\n\n\"Wow, what a beautiful bracelet! How much do you think it's worth?\" Sura's eyes lit up with a glint like that of gold coins.\n\nYe Yinzhu said with a wry smile, \"All you think about is money.\"\n\nSura huffed and said, \"Money isn't everything, but you can't do anything without it. What would we eat without money? And you, a boy, wearing a bracelet.\" Suddenly, as if he'd thought of something, his eyes widened. \"You're not going to tell me that this bracelet *is* the weapon you used today, are you?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled faintly. \"It's called Bi Si.¹ Watch.\" As he spoke, he gave his wrist a light flick. Instantly, the jade-green bracelet flashed with light and extended, becoming a three-zhang-long² jade-green thread in the blink of an eye. Controlled by a faint yellow Dou Qi, it constantly shifted into various shapes in the air, giving it the strange feeling of being alive.\n\nStartled, Sura reached out and grabbed Bi Si from the air. She discovered it was only slightly thicker than a strand of hair. It felt naturally warm and smooth in her hand. When she tugged at it gently, Bi Si didn't react at all; it was extremely tough.\n\nWith a light movement of Ye Yinzhu's four fingers, it coiled back in ripples, re-wrapping around his wrist and returning to the form of a bracelet. \"The place I live is called the Azure Sea; it's a small place in the Kingdom of Arcadia. The Azure Sea is an extremely large bamboo forest. At the center of this forest is a single Bamboo of Life, the core of the entire Azure Sea. The Bamboo of Life has a core, and every hundred years, one inch of it grows. That is Bi Si. You could say it's one of the toughest things in this world, and moreover, it contains an immense amount of life force.\"\n\nSura stared, dumbfounded. \"One inch per hundred years? Your Bi Si is three zhang long... doesn't that make it thirty thousand years old?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled. \"Yes! That's why its life force is so immense. Don't be fooled by it being just a thin thread; it can be both soft and hard, has countless uses, and can even smash stone to powder. Its sharpness is second to none among weapons.\" What he didn't say was that this Bi Si was the ultimate treasure of the Bamboo Sect. Ye Yinzhu was born with eight fingers. Because he lacked the little fingers on both hands, he was not suited for practicing swordsmanship. His grandfather, Ye Li, after more than ten years of research, used the Bamboo Sect's martial arts as a foundation and Bi Si as the weapon to create this special set of martial skills suited for him.\n\nBack then, Qin Shang had made an agreement with Ye Li not to teach Ye Yinzhu any martial skills for fifteen years. And Ye Yinzhu was already sixteen when he left the Azure Sea. From the time he was fifteen, Bi Si came into his possession. Aside from cultivating the *Zither Heart of an Innocent Child*, he spent a year painstakingly training with Bi Si; Bi Si *was* his martial art. With his Yellow-rank, initial-stage Bamboo Dou Qi as a foundation, and as the direct disciple of the Bamboo Sect, Ye Yinzhu's comprehension ability, free from distractions, was several times that of an ordinary person. Although he hadn't yet mastered Bi Si to the point of perfect, fluid control, he could at least use the Bamboo Sect martial skills that Ye Li had taught him. Today, when facing the green dragon, because Fei Fei's speed was unexpected, he didn't have time to counter with sound blades. Left with no choice, he used this martial art for the first time. If not for the toughness and sharpness of Bi Si, how could the scale defense of a true dragon like the green dragon have been pierced?\n\n\"So you really are a dual magic and martial cultivator. Yellow-rank Dou Qi! It's much stronger than your magic.\" Sura looked at the Bi Si on Ye Yinzhu's hand, a strange glint flashing in his eyes.\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled without a word. Regarding the secrets of his abilities, even though he already trusted Sura a great deal, he still couldn't reveal them lightly.\n\nJust then, a knock suddenly sounded at the door.\n\n\"Who would come this late? Could Haiyang be back again?\" Sura wondered aloud as he got up and went to the outer room to open the door.\n\nNina, dressed in a white magic robe, walked in from outside. The moment she entered, she asked, \"How is Ye Yinzhu?\"\n\n\"Ah, Director Nina, hello. Yinzhu is already awake.\" Sura hurriedly welcomed Nina into the room.\n\n\"Grandma Nina, what brings you here?\" Ye Yinzhu stood up. The room was really a bit small, so he had no choice but to offer Nina his bed to sit on.\n\nNina looked Ye Yinzhu up and down a few times. From his already clear eyes, she could tell he was in good condition. \"You're alright? You recovered so quickly. I really don't know what your body is made of.\" Seeing that Ye Yinzhu was fine, she visibly relaxed.\n\nYe Yinzhu scratched his head. \"I don't know why I recovered so fast either. Maybe my body is just sturdier.\" Though he said this, he couldn't help but think of that dream that made his body unbearably itchy, and he vaguely felt that his recovery had something to do with it.\n\n\"I'm relieved you're okay. I came today, first, to see how you were doing, and second, to tell you some good news.\" Nina showed a rare smile. Her mood was excellent; she hadn't been this happy in many years.\n\n\"Good news? What good news?\" Ye Yinzhu asked in surprise.\n\nNina smiled. \"Our Divine Music department has already broken into the finals of the freshman tournament.\"\n\n\"Huh? Didn't we only just compete in six preliminary matches?\" Ye Yinzhu said, dumbfounded.\n\nNina said proudly, \"Praise Falan, perhaps this is the favor of the heavens. Our Divine Music department has six wins in six battles and has already entered the finals. We're the first for both the magic division and the martial arts division.\"\n\nSura, at his side, said, \"No way. Even if the Divine Music department is this year's dark horse, there are still the three favorites: the Space, Summoning, and Spirit departments! The Divine Music department's last three matches are against them; it's going to be a tough fight. How can you be so certain of victory already?\"\n\nNina said, \"Of course not. Because we've already qualified, even without playing out the final three matches. The freshmen from the Spirit and Space departments this year are quite good, but their strengths are too similar. In the matches held concurrently this afternoon, they fought to a mutually destructive end. Of the ten participating students from both sides, eight, including their captains, were seriously injured and have already withdrawn from tomorrow's competition. This means the best they can do is a record of seven wins and two losses. And it just so happens that those two departments are our opponents for tomorrow. With wins by default, that makes eight wins for us. Regardless of the result of our final match against the Summoning department, one of the two qualifying spots for the magic division will definitely be ours. The Summoning department's luck is also quite good; they also don't face us, the Space department, or the Spirit department until their final two days of matches. It's almost certain they'll advance along with us.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said in pleasant surprise, \"So that's how it is. It seems our luck is really too good. Grandma Nina, don't worry, I will definitely prepare for the final match against the Summoning department and strive to defeat them.\"\n\nNina shook her head. \"No. I've already decided that we will forfeit our match against the Summoning department.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Ye Yinzhu's eyes widened.\n\n***\n**Translator's Notes:**\n1.  **Bi Si (碧絲):** Literally \"Jade Silk\" or \"Jade Thread.\"\n2.  **Zhang (丈):** A traditional Chinese unit of length, roughly 3.33 meters or about 10.9 feet.

    "content": "A new year has arrived. I wish you all a Happy New Year and a happy family.\n\n  ————————————————————\n\n  Nina said, \"It's been obvious to anyone watching the last few days of matches that even though the Divine Music Department has five contestants, it was essentially you alone who defeated the six great magic departments. It's been too hard on you, and the toll on both your magical and mental energy has been significant. Although your body is fine now, I hope you'll get more rest and try to recover to your peak condition for the finals. Also, if you encounter another dangerous situation like yesterday's in the finals, concede immediately. This is just a competition, after all. I don't want any accidents to happen.\"\n\n  Although Nina's tone was placid, Ye Yinzhu and Sula could both hear the concern in her words.\n\n  \"Grandma Nina, who are our opponents in the finals?\" Ye Yinzhu asked.\n\n  Nina replied, \"It's hard to say right now. The Martial Arts Division has seventeen departments, so their round-robin tournament will take a few more days than ours. Several of the major departments there are close in strength, so it's difficult to predict who will make it to the finals. If we enter as the second-place team from the Magic Division, we will face the first-place team from the Martial Arts Division. The major departments in the Martial Arts Division are relatively balanced in power; the difference between the top two won't be that great, so it doesn't matter much if we give up the number one spot in the Magic Division. The final stage of the competition won't start for at least another week. You don't need to report to the Divine Music Department for the next few days. Just rest in your dorm.\"\n\n  \"Alright, thank you, Grandma Nina.\"\n\n  \"Oh, that's right. Dean Ferguson has been watching all of our Divine Music Department's matches. As the academy's dean and its most powerful magician, he is of the Spirit Department. He told me privately that he's interested in guiding you in your cultivation of mental energy. Although our Divine Music and Spirit Department magic have their differences, their application leads to the same destination. Once the semester officially begins, I hope you will accept his guidance. It will be very beneficial for you. I have to go now. Walk me out.\"\n\n  Nina stood up, and accompanied by Ye Yinzhu, walked out of his dormitory. She glanced back and saw that Sula had not followed, then said to Ye Yinzhu, \"Yinzhu, if Dean Ferguson comes looking for you, it's fine for him to guide you in your magic cultivation. However, you must remember, you cannot tell him the secrets of the Divine Music Department that your teacher taught you. Do you understand what I mean?\"\n\n  Ye Yinzhu nodded. \"I understand.\"\n\n  \"Are you living well here?\" Nina glanced at the dormitory behind Ye Yinzhu and couldn't help but frown.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu nodded. \"It's quite good.\"\n\n  \"Good? Good my ass. I'll help you arrange a transfer later. How can a student of our Divine Music Department live in a place like this?\"\n\n  \"But, but I don't have any money...\" Ye Yinzhu said in a low voice.\n\n  Nina said nonchalantly, \"I have the authority to waive some fees for students in my department. You don't need to worry about it.\"\n\n  \"Grandma Nina, I...\"\n\n  \"Don't 'I' me. Go on back inside.\" A benevolent light shone in Nina's eyes as she nodded at Ye Yinzhu, then turned to leave. Ye Yinzhu watched until her figure, showing no signs of old age, disappeared into the night.\n\n  Returning to the dorm, Ye Yinzhu casually filled a large basin with clean water and carried it back to the bedroom. He took his towel from the cabinet by the bed and tossed it into the basin.\n\n  Sula, who was sitting up in bed, asked in surprise, \"Yinzhu, what are you doing?\"\n\n  \"Bathing! My body is all sticky, it's so uncomfortable.\" As he spoke, Ye Yinzhu quickly took off his Moon God's Guard, leaving only a pair of shorts on. The Moon God's Guard wouldn't get stained, but he had sweated a lot and felt extremely uncomfortable.\n\n  \"Ah—\" A high-octave shriek suddenly erupted. Sula stared at Ye Yinzhu's bare torso, his lips trembling as if he had received a great shock. He saw that Ye Yinzhu, who usually appeared slender, had a very well-proportioned and excellent physique. Although his muscles weren't exaggeratedly bulky, they gave off a sense of harmony. Beneath his bronze skin, a faint purple halo seemed to be circulating.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu was startled by his scream and nearly kicked over the water basin. \"Sula, what are you doing?\"\n\n  \"Nothing. Why are you washing in the room?\" Sula watched as Ye Yinzhu's hands were already moving to take off his last pair of shorts. He hurriedly turned around and covered his head with the blanket.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu said, amused, \"It's cold outside! The weather is getting chilly. Besides, how could I do it outside? It wouldn't be good if a female student saw me. I'm not an exhibitionist.\"\n\n  \"You—you are an exhibitionist.\" Sula's voice sounded a little shaky. Under the blanket, his heart was racing. As a calm and ruthless assassin-in-training, it had been a long time since he'd felt so flustered. Hearing the splashing of water, Sula wished he could bolt out of the dormitory right then and there. Every minute felt as long as an hour to him.\n\n  \"Much better.\" With a contented groan, Ye Yinzhu lay down on his not-so-wide bed and stretched comfortably. Thoroughly washing the grime from his body was definitely a satisfying pleasure. \"Sula, aren't you going to wash up? I don't think I've ever seen you take a bath.\"\n\n  \"I've already washed. I'm not an exhibitionist like you, bathing in front of other people,\" Sula said peevishly.\n\n  \"We're both men, what's there to be afraid of? I really didn't expect our Divine Music Department to advance just like that.\"\n\n  Sula turned around, poking his head out from under the blanket. He looked at Ye Yinzhu and said, \"That's right! You get to rest for a week this time. Why don't we go find some part-time work now? I saw a place hiring when I was in Milan City yesterday.\"\n\n  \"Oh? Alright!\" Ye Yinzhu agreed immediately without even asking what kind of job Sula had found.\n\n  Early the next morning, just as the sky was beginning to lighten, Ye Yinzhu was dragged out of bed by Sula.\n\n  \"Let me sleep a little longer.\" Ye Yinzhu hugged his blanket tightly, his eyes bleary with sleep. Although his body had miraculously recovered, his mental energy had been greatly depleted in yesterday's battle.\n\n  \"Get up, get up, I've already prepared breakfast. Didn't we agree to go to work today?\" Sula pulled and tugged, hauling Ye Yinzhu out of bed and pressing a cold towel to his face.\n\n  Stimulated by the cold, damp towel, Ye Yinzhu instantly became much more awake. He sat up helplessly. His nose twitched; breakfast was a simple meal of steamed buns, pickled vegetables, and congee, but under Sula's excellent culinary skills, waves of fragrance continuously stimulated his sense of taste. Only then did he feel the emptiness in his stomach, and he made a beeline for the table to start eating.\n\n  \"Hey, you haven't washed up yet. Go wash up before you eat,\" Sula said, grabbing Ye Yinzhu.\n\n  \"Boss Sula, you don't have to be such a neat freak, do you? I'm starving. Can't I eat first?\"\n\n  \"No.\" Sula's reply was simple and firm. He stared intently at Ye Yinzhu and pointed to the basin of clean water he had prepared nearby.\n\n  \"Fine, fine, you win.\" Although Sula was like the strictest of housekeepers, this was a warmth of home that Ye Yinzhu had rarely experienced, even in the Azure Sea. Despite his feeling of helplessness, he subconsciously enjoyed this feeling. After all, back then, Qin Shang had only cared about his cultivation, and was quite casual about everything else.\n\n  By the time the two had finished breakfast and left the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy, most of the students were still asleep or meditating. Milan was located in the northern part of the continent, and with the arrival of early autumn, the weather had already turned a bit chilly. Even the lush vegetation within the academy had taken on a somewhat bleak air.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"linkcontent\">www.cmfu.com</a> Qidian Chinese Network welcomes all readers to come and read.

    "content": "To my dear readers, please add this to your favorites and vote. Thank you.\n\n  —————————————————————————————-\n\n  \"Yin Zhu, let's have a race,\" Sura said enthusiastically.\n\n  \"A race? What kind of race?\" Ye Yin Zhu looked at him curiously.\n\n  Sura said, \"Let's race to Milan City. It's about two li¹ from here. We'll see who gets to the city gate first, how about it? I was worried that going to the city to work every day would be too far and your body wouldn't be able to take it, but since you also practice martial skills, I'm not worried anymore. Just think of it as exercise.\" As he spoke, he bounced on his toes, eager to start.\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu glanced at the distant walls of Milan City, visible on the horizon, and smiled. \"Alright.\"\n\n  \"Start.\" Sura gave a cunning smile, and before Ye Yin Zhu could react, his body had already shot forward. Without any obvious wind-up, his body lightly blurred into a phantom, covering several dozen meters in the blink of an eye.\n\n  The Bamboo Dou Qi rose node by node within his body. Ye Yin Zhu hurriedly circulated his energy and gave chase. His Second Stage Yellow Bamboo, equivalent to a mid-tier Green-rank Dou Qi, was dense and pure, allowing him to maintain a high speed during the sprint. However, he was quickly shocked to discover that even at full tilt, he could only watch Sura's figure gradually pull away. Sura's speed was as illusory as it was real; in the space of just a few breaths, only a faint shadow remained ahead of him.\n\n  *So fast. What level of power does Sura actually possess?* Ye Yin Zhu's mind was now filled with questions.\n\n  A distance of two li was very short for a warrior, which was why Milan City's walls were visible from the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts. By the time Ye Yin Zhu reached the west gate of Milan City, Sura was already waiting for him with a smile, his face not flushed, his breathing even, looking as if nothing had happened.\n\n  \"Sura, you're really fast,\" Ye Yin Zhu said sincerely. Although Sura had cheated at the start, he knew that even if they had started at the same time, he could never have caught up to him.\n\n  Sura smiled faintly. \"It's not that I'm fast, it's that you're too slow. Let's go, we're entering the city.\"\n\n  The sun had just risen from the horizon, and Milan City was like a person just waking from a dream. The bustling energy Ye Yin Zhu had witnessed on his last visit had not yet been released, and there were still very few people on the streets.\n\n  Sura seemed extremely familiar with the city. As he walked, he pointed out the surrounding buildings, introducing them to Ye Yin Zhu. \"Look, over there is the magical items shop. Ordinary people can't just go in there. Even though their stuff isn't that great, the prices are absurdly high. Only nobles go there. Over there is the Warrior's Guild. Whatever color your Dou Qi has reached, as long as you're a registered warrior of the Milan Empire, you can receive a badge of the corresponding rank from there... And that restaurant over there is one of Milan's more famous ones; a lot of nobles like to eat there. Wow, look, that's where the Dragon Knights are stationed. The reason Milan is the continent's number one city has a lot to do with the three Dragon Knight battalions stationed here. No country besides Milan would station so many Dragon Knights in its own capital.\"\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu followed Sura's finger and saw a compound surrounded by walls as high as the city walls, isolating it from the outside world. It was impossible to tell how large the area was from the outside. In the center of the wall was a massive gatehouse, easily over ten meters tall, with a wide gate almost as large as the city gate itself. The most eye-catching feature was the Dragon Knights seated atop their tamed dragons in front of the gate.\n\n  Somber and sturdy black armor completely encased the Dragon Knights' bodies. In their hands, they held dragon lances over five meters long, pointed forward. The sharp tips glinted with a faint, cold light in the newly risen sun. Beneath them were identical gray Earth Dragons, nearly three meters tall and over five meters long, their massive bodies seeming to emanate an invisible, ferocious aura. The thickness of their black dragon scales was evident from their sharp ridges. Although there were only two Dragon Knights there, they looked like a pair of killing machines.\n\n  \"Sura, what kind of dragon is that? I've never seen one before,\" Ye Yin Zhu asked in a low voice.\n\n  Sura said, \"It's a type of Earth Dragon called a Machino Iron Dragon. 'Machino' means 'indestructible' in an ancient language. Although this Earth Dragon is only level four, its defense is renowned among its kind. With its tough scales, ordinary attacks can't harm it at all. Among the Dragon Knights, they are considered a primary combat force, used specifically for frontal assaults and defense. It's as famous as the Eric Swift Dragon. Although these two types of dragons have the lowest status in the Dragon Knight legions, they are also the most numerous. Of course, compared to that Green Dragon you defeated yesterday, the Machino Iron Dragon is trash.\"\n\n  \"Oh? Are Green Dragons really that powerful? It seemed pretty average to me,\" Ye Yin Zhu said noncommittally.\n\n  Sura said in exasperation, \"You idiot, the Green Dragon you beat yesterday was a growth-type magical beast; it wasn't even an adult yet. In terms of strength, it wasn't much stronger than this Machino Iron Dragon. But once it reaches adulthood, it will have the power of a seventh or eighth-level beast. Forget you, even Director Nina of your Divine Music Department would have a hard time dealing with it. Don't forget, that's a true dragon, not a tamed dragon.\"\n\n  \"If true dragons are so good, then why do the Dragon Knight legions use tamed dragons?\" Ye Yin Zhu once again displayed his pure, or one might say idiotic, childlike nature.\n\n  Sura rolled his eyes. \"What do you think true dragons are? If they were that easy to tame, they wouldn't be true dragons. The number of true dragons on the Longqinus Continent has never exceeded four digits, and most of them are extremely proud. They would never submit to a human unless for some special reason. Humans who possess an adult true dragon can become Dragon Knight Generals or Dragon Mages; they are the top-tier existences in every country, a symbol of power. In the Dragon Knight legions, only Gold Star and Purple Star Dragon Knight Generals can possess true dragons. Actually, there are many powerful individuals among the tamed dragons, but their numbers are too scarce. In terms of cavalry deployment, if every tamed dragon had different abilities, it would be impossible to command them. Therefore, when choosing tamed dragons, they prioritize those that are more numerous and have useful abilities. The Eric Swift Dragon and the Machino Iron Dragon are classic examples.\"\n\n  As the two were talking, the gate to the Dragon Knight barracks suddenly opened. As the ground let out a series of painful groans, a colossal body stepped out from within. A single horn, a meter long and glinting like golden crystal, emerged first, followed by a massive body four meters tall and ten meters long. Its heavy and ferocious aura created a suffocating pressure. Dazzling silver armor and a heavy dragon lance, two meters longer and much thicker than that of an ordinary Dragon Knight, both proclaimed his noble status and formidable strength.\n\n  \"Ah! It's him.\" Ye Yin Zhu recognized this person. It was the Silver Star Dragon Knight General, Viscount Austin, whom he had met on the road to Milan City.\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu saw Austin, but Austin certainly didn't see him. The massive Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon King took up more than a third of the street's width as it lumbered toward the west gate. Austin's expression was a bit grim, his thoughts unknown.\n\n  \"You know him?\" There was a strange note in Sura's questioning voice.\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu nodded. \"I saw him once on the way to the academy. He's very domineering. He even wanted to eat our mercenary group's Horned Horses.\" He had already told Sura about traveling to Milan with the Iron Thorn Mercenary Group.\n\n  Sura's face grew serious. \"Yin Zhu, I'm afraid you're in trouble. It looks like Austin is heading to our academy.\"\n\n  \"Trouble? What trouble? What does him going to our academy have to do with me?\" Ye Yin Zhu asked, confused.\n\n  Sura glanced at him and said, \"You really don't know anything, do you? The reason I say you're in trouble is because Austin is that little witch Luolan's older brother. Yesterday, you injured both Luolan and her magical beast, the Green Dragon.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Li (里):** A traditional Chinese unit of distance, roughly 500 meters or about a third of a mile.",

    "content": "To my fellow book friends, please add this to your collection and vote. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nYe Yinzhu was taken aback. \"What did you say? Austin is Roland's older brother? Are you saying he's going to seek revenge against me? But the freshman tournament was a fair competition.\"\n\nSula shook his head and said, \"I can't be sure, but it's a possibility. Fortunately, our academy holds a transcendent status, so I imagine Austin wouldn't dare to be too outrageous. It seems I need to tell you about Roland's background. In the Milan Empire, there are three great families, each holding a position of immense importance. The Violet Family, which Roland belongs to, is one of them. The family patriarch is Maldini, one of the two marshals of the Milan Empire's military and one of its two Purple Star Dragon Knights. Maldini also has a brother named Materazzi, who is the vice president of the Milan Magician's Guild and is said to have just reached the Purple rank.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu frowned. He truly hadn't expected Roland to have such a powerful family backing her, but the expression on his face quickly returned to calm.\n\n\"Do you know what a Purple Star Dragon Knight represents? It means they are among the most powerful existences on the continent, second only to the Seven Towers of Falan. Only a Purple-ranked Grand Battle Master paired with a ninth-rank giant dragon can earn the title of Purple Star Dragon Knight. Materazzi dedicated his life to magical research and never married, so naturally, he has no descendants. As for Maldini, his only son died in battle against the beastmen, leaving behind four children. The youngest is Roland. She has three older brothers, the eldest of whom is Austin, who is also the least talented of the Violet Family's third generation. Roland's second brother, Okafor, is the youngest Gold Star Dragon Knight on the Longinus Continent and possesses an adult eighth-rank Earth-elemental dragon. Her third brother, Oliveira, is also at our Milan Magic and Martial Academy. He's a fifth-year student, hailed as the number one student in the Martial Arts Department. He possesses a water-elemental Growth-type dragon mount, which has already advanced to the seventh rank. It's said that upon graduation, he will immediately become a Silver Star Dragon Knight, with a chance to break the record for the continent's youngest Gold Star Dragon Knight. As the youngest, Roland is undoubtedly the most doted upon. Unlike her three brothers, she chose the path of magic. Since Materazzi has no children, he dotes on this grandniece the most. At Roland's request, he even became the chief magician of the Violet Mercenary Corps that the four siblings established. You have to understand, for a Purple-ranked magician to condescend to join a mercenary group is an extremely rare occurrence on the entire continent. You've offended Roland quite badly. You're in for it now.\"\n\nHearing Sula's words, a thoughtful light flickered in Ye Yinzhu's eyes. He recalled the scene at the Mercenary Guild; clearly, that Purple-ranked Grand Magus must have been Roland's great-uncle, Materazzi. As for the other young warrior, he didn't know if it was her second or third brother.\n\nSula saw Ye Yinzhu pondering in silence and thought he was worried about his situation. He said with a wry smile, \"Even though you've only been at the academy for a few days, the Violet Family isn't the only one you've offended. That Dark Magic Department ace, the first-year freshman Yue Ming, is a member of another of the three great families, the Yuehui Family. And her status in the Yuehui Family is similar to Roland's in the Violet Family. Yue Ming's grandfather, Yue Hui, is the symbol of the family's rise to prominence. He is the president of the Milan Magician's Guild, a Purple-ranked, fifth-tier Grand Magus of the Dark Magic Department, and is said to be the most powerful mage outside of the Seven Towers of Falan. He's even more formidable than Materazzi. He is as famous as our academy's dean, Ferguson—a Purple-ranked, fourth-tier Grand Magus of the Spiritual Magic Department—and is the Imperial Minister of Magic, in charge of all magicians in the entire Milan Empire.\"\n\nLifting his head, Ye Yinzhu's gaze was as clear as ever. He smiled faintly and said, \"So what? Let's go.\"\n\n\"Huh? Aren't you worried about your situation at all?\" Sula said in astonishment, looking at Ye Yinzhu, who seemed completely unfazed.\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled slightly. \"Weren't you going to take me to find work? If we don't hurry, we'll run out of time.\"\n\n\"It seems I'm just playing the zither for a cow.¹ You're really not worried at all?\" Sula felt utterly defeated by Ye Yinzhu. It was as if he didn't care at all about what Sula had just said. However, he couldn't help but be impressed by Ye Yinzhu's composure. If their roles were reversed, Sula knew he couldn't possibly be as calm and collected as Ye Yinzhu.\n\nAs he walked forward with Sula, Ye Yinzhu said calmly, \"What is there to worry about? What do those important figures you mentioned have to do with me? They aren't going to come looking for trouble with a common little student from the Milan Magic and Martial Academy just because their granddaughter was defeated in a fair match, are they?\" Having lived with Purple-ranked experts since childhood—both of his grandfathers possessed that level of power—coupled with the Bamboo Dou Qi he cultivated, his nature was inherently peaceful yet unyieldingly resilient.\n\nThe two walked for a full hour through Milan City before Sula brought Ye Yinzhu to their destination. It was an elegantly styled three-story building, not particularly conspicuous in the bustling city of Milan. Moreover, it was located not on a main road but on a side street, where the surroundings seemed a bit quiet.\n\nThe architecture of this three-story building was very distinctive. It didn't cover a very large area, similar in size to the Divine Music Department's teaching building. Octagonal, upturned eaves, dark green glazed tiles, and the building's overall refreshing colors gave it a comfortable feel. It was surrounded by lush greenery, all tall trees that, despite the already chilly weather, were still growing with unusual vigor. The interplay between the trees and the building filled the three-story structure with an air of nature. Most peculiar of all, a giant tree grew out from the center of the building, as if the three-story structure had been built around it. The tree's crown emerged completely from the third-story roof, blooming with a layer of small, light-blue flowers that emitted a faint fragrance, musky and orchid-like. It was quaint and elegant, making it easy for one to become immersed in the atmosphere. Perhaps because he came from the Azure Sea, Ye Yinzhu felt a sense of familiarity upon seeing the building.\n\n\"What do you think? Not bad, right? I was very selective before I chose this place to work. The environment is great, and the pay is good too. This is a teahouse. A server makes about ten silver coins a day, and I hear there are tips, too. If you do a good job, the wages are even higher. Come on, let's go in.\" As he spoke, Sula tugged on Ye Yinzhu's sleeve and headed toward the teahouse.\n\nAs they drew near, Ye Yinzhu looked up and saw a plaque above the teahouse with three large characters—Floating Orchid Pavilion.² The name seemed a bit familiar! Before he could think more on it, Sula had already pulled him inside.\n\n\"I'm sorry, gentlemen, but we haven't opened for business yet.\" A waiter who appeared to be around twenty years old stopped the two of them. His blue shirt and trousers seemed to be a uniform. Though his features were average, he had a serene temperament that easily made a good impression.\n\n\"We're not here for tea,\" Sula said hastily. \"I saw you had a hiring notice up yesterday. We're here to apply.\"\n\nThe waiter smiled slightly. \"I'm sorry, you're too late. After we posted the notice yesterday, more than three hundred applicants came in the afternoon. We've already found suitable candidates.\"\n\n---\n¹ A Chinese idiom, `對牛彈琴` (duì niú tán qín), literally \"to play the zither for a cow.\" It means to speak to an unappreciative audience or to waste one's efforts on someone who cannot understand.\n² The original name is `飄蘭軒` (Piāo Lán Xuān). `飄` means floating or drifting, `蘭` means orchid, and `軒` refers to a pavilion or studio.",

    "content": "To my readers, please add this to your favorites and vote. Thank you.\n\n—————————————————————————————-\n\n\"Praise Falan, are you really not hiring anymore? We're very hardworking, and, look, we're work-study students from the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy. Our caliber is definitely higher than the average person's,\" Sula said, anxiously recommending himself and Ye Yinzhu.\n\nThe server shrugged somewhat helplessly. \"I'm terribly sorry, but we've already hired enough people. You should have come yesterday; perhaps there would have been a chance. Please, you may go.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu raised his left hand and grasped Sula's slender shoulder. \"Let it go. Since they've already hired enough people, let's try somewhere else. Don't make things difficult for them.\"\n\nSula had wanted to argue further, but hearing Ye Yinzhu's words, he could only nod in resignation.\n\nJust as the two were turning to leave, the server suddenly called out with some excitement, \"Wait a moment.\" He took a step forward, his eyes fixed on the left hand Ye Yinzhu was using to hold Sula's shoulder, and said respectfully, \"Sir, may I ask if your name is Ye Yinzhu?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu answered subconsciously, \"Yes! How do you know my name?\"\n\nThe server stepped aside, clearing their path, and bowed respectfully to Ye Yinzhu. \"My apologies, I was presumptuous just now, not realizing you were a friend of the Young Mistress. This way, please.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu was taken aback. \"The Young Mistress? Do I know your Young Mistress?\"\n\nThe server said in surprise, \"Is your name not Ye Yinzhu? The Young Mistress instructed that if a young man arrives wearing her ring, it would be you.\"\n\nIt suddenly dawned on Ye Yinzhu. \"Piao Lan Xuan, Piao Lan Xuan... could this be Big Sister Anya's place?\" Only then did he remember why the three words \"Piao Lan Xuan\" sounded so familiar. Back when he first arrived in Milan and parted ways with Anya, she had told him to come find her at Piao Lan Xuan if he ever needed anything.\n\n\"Yes. Piao Lan Xuan was founded by the Young Mistress herself. This way, please.\" As he spoke, the server led Ye Yinzhu and Sula inside.\n\nUpon entering Piao Lan Xuan, the first thing that met their eyes was a sea of green. It wasn't just the various plants inside Piao Lan Xuan; even all the furnishings and utensils were varying shades of green, showing just how fond the owner was of the color. It didn't feel luxurious, but it possessed an indescribable elegance. The pillars supporting the entire building seemed to be carved from green crystal.\n\nThe center of the small building was open, and Ye Yinzhu and Sula finally got a clear view of the ancient tree they had seen sprouting from within. The trunk of the ancient tree would require at least twenty people holding hands to encircle. They had never seen such a massive tree before. Perhaps it was because of this ancient tree and Piao Lan Xuan's open architectural style that the air here was incredibly fresh. Everything around them was spotless, and a few staff members in cyan uniforms were tidying up.\n\nSula gave the soft flesh on Ye Yinzhu's waist a light pinch and whispered with some annoyance, \"So you knew the owner here all along. Were you deliberately trying to watch me make a fool of myself just now?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu gave a wry smile. \"Of course not. When we arrived, I thought the name 'Piao Lan Xuan' looked familiar, but you were pulling me along so fast I didn't have time to think before you dragged me in. Didn't I tell you? On the way to Milan, my spatial ring was stolen, and I lost all my money. When I came to Milan with the Iron Thorn Mercenary Group, we were escorting Big Sister Anya's trade caravan. Big Sister Anya is a very kind person. Since we couldn't find a job, it's good to come see her.\"\n\nThe server led the two to a table near the center, from which they had a clear view of the ancient tree trunk outside and where the air was particularly fresh. \"Please have a seat. I will go and inform the Young Mistress.\" With that, he headed directly upstairs. The staircase was built spiraling around the central ancient tree, giving it a unique character, but it didn't touch the tree itself, a clear consideration for the tree's protection.\n\nThe simple wooden table was wide and held an antique-style tea set. The chairs were also wooden, a dark green color. Ye Yinzhu looked around and noticed that although the first floor of Piao Lan Xuan was spacious, there were very few seats. In the entire hall circling the central ancient tree, there were only ten tables, each enclosed by bamboo curtains. Perhaps because they hadn't opened for business yet, the curtains were currently raised, allowing a full view of the hall.\n\nSula said admiringly, \"This place is wonderful. Even though it's just the first-floor hall, they've given full consideration to the customers' privacy. And this ancient tree in the center is just so peculiar. A teahouse like this is probably one of a kind on the entire continent.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu looked down at the ring on the middle finger of his left hand. The teardrop-shaped blue gem emitted a warm, gentle glow. Though not intense, the soft feeling was very pleasant. Sula also saw the ring on his hand, pouted, and muttered to himself, \"A woman giving a man a ring, that's really a rare sight.\"\n\nBefore long, with the sound of light footsteps, Anya descended the spiral staircase by the ancient tree. Today, she wore a sea-green long dress, its hem trailing to the floor, concealing her long, slender legs. Her aqua-blue hair was still draped over her back as usual, and even the two strands that hung down to cover her ears were unchanged. Even with the surprise filling her eyes, it couldn't disrupt her elegant and noble bearing. Among the women Ye Yinzhu had met, only Xiang Luan could compare to her in looks and temperament, but Xiang Luan lacked some of Anya's mature charm, possessing instead more youthful vitality.\n\n\"Yinzhu, have you finally remembered to come see your big sister?\" Anya walked over with a smile.\n\nYe Yinzhu hurriedly stood up to greet her. He had always been very honest and said, somewhat embarrassed, \"Actually, I came here with a classmate to look for work. I didn't expect it to happen to be your place, Big Sister.\"\n\nAnya glanced at Sula behind Ye Yinzhu, a trace of surprise in her beautiful eyes. Looking back at Ye Yinzhu, she said with a hint of reproach, \"The expenses for a student at the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy have always been high. You! Since you were in such difficulty, why did you refuse the money I offered you back then?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu shook his head. \"I can't take your money, Big Sister. The coursework at the academy isn't too demanding. The money I earn from working should be enough for my tuition and expenses.\"\n\nFrom the moment Anya appeared, Sula's expression had been a little strange. \"Yinzhu, since they're not hiring here, let's go. We still have to find a job.\"\n\nAnya smiled faintly. \"There's no hurry. Have some tea and rest for a bit first.\" As she spoke, she nodded to the blue-clothed server who had come down with her, and the server immediately turned and left.\n\nAnya had Ye Yinzhu and Sula sit back down, taking a seat not far from Ye Yinzhu herself. She said to them, \"What kind of work are you looking for? Since Yinzhu wants to support himself, perhaps I can help you find a suitable job.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said, \"Any job will do, as long as it's within our abilities. We were originally planning to apply to be servers here, but we only found out it was your shop after we arrived.\"\n\n&lt;a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\"&gt;Qidian Chinese Network welcomes all readers to visit and read.

    "content": "The Featured Post event will be held as usual tomorrow night at 12:10 AM. Friends are welcome to join. Please remember to bookmark and vote for the book, thank you.\n\n  —————————————————————————————-\n\n  Before An Ya could speak, Su La had already cut in, \"Let's not trouble Miss An Ya. We'll find it ourselves.\"\n\n  An Ya smiled. \"It's no trouble at all. Yin Zhu, I remember you are a Divine Music Master, and you mentioned last time that you would play the zither for me. I have a zither here. How about you play a piece for me now? Though my server positions are filled, I happen to be short a performing Divine Music Master.\" Here, she gave Su La a half-smiling glance and said, \"Of course, I don't play favorites. If your zither skills don't meet my requirements, I won't hire you.\"\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu smiled. \"I'd like to play a piece for you even if you don't hire me, big sister. I already have my own zither.\"\n\n  At that moment, the tea was served in an exquisite purple clay teapot and cups. The server had clearly already rinsed the leaves and warmed the pot, and poured the tea from the pot directly into the bowls. Instantly, the fresh fragrance of plum blossoms wafted out, refreshing the mind and heart; the scent alone was delightful. The tea was a pale red, giving it an alluring appearance.\n\n  An Ya smiled. \"Have some tea first. This is Crimson Plum Blossom Tea, a type of flower tea. It's a mandatory tribute for the Milan Royal Court, and its production is extremely scarce. It has the effect of reducing internal heat, soothing inflammation, detoxifying, beautifying the skin, and slowing aging. I've added a bit of rock sugar, so the taste is quite nice.\"\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu lifted his teacup and took a sip. A warm current flowed down his throat, and the cozy feeling dispelled much of the chill from outside. Immediately after, a faint fragrance of plum blossoms, accompanied by the sweetness in his mouth, was exhaled from his lungs. It felt as if every pore on his body had opened up. It was an indescribably pleasant sensation, and he couldn't help but subconsciously say, \"Good tea.\"\n\n  When Su La first saw it was flower tea, a trace of disdain showed in his eyes. But after he also took a sip, the disdain was instantly replaced by astonishment. Before he knew it, he had drunk the entire small cup of Crimson Plum Blossom Tea.\n\n  An Ya smiled faintly. \"When it comes to tea, green tea and oolong tea have always been held in the highest esteem, but I personally love flower tea. Many people look down on flower tea, even calling it the commoner of teas. But I don't see it that way. First of all, the flower tea here isn't made by stir-frying flowers and tea leaves together. It is made from real flowers, which are dried before being brewed. This is also the main specialty of my Drifting Orchid Pavilion. This kind of flower tea, I believe, is the nobility among teas. The different effects of different flower teas are far better than those of green and oolong teas.\"\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu gave a simple, honest smile. \"I don't know much about tea, but it really is delicious.\"\n\n  An Ya sighed softly. \"Tea culture has a long and profound history, passed down from the former Eastern Dragon Empire. It's a pity that so much of it has been lost by now...\"\n\n  \"The Eastern Dragon Empire?\" Ye Yin Zhu looked at An Ya in astonishment. Although it was the first time he had heard this name, the words \"Eastern Dragon\" were all too familiar. His grandfather and Grandpa Qin had mentioned the Eight Sects of the Eastern Dragon more than once. While he didn't understand the meaning, he figured it must be connected to the Eastern Dragon Empire An Ya spoke of.\n\n  An Ya's expression shifted slightly, but she quickly returned to normal and hurriedly changed the subject. \"Yin Zhu, weren't you going to play the zither for me? How about we start now?\"\n\n  Although Ye Yin Zhu was surprised, he was simple-hearted. As soon as An Ya changed the topic, he didn't press the matter. A blue, water-drop-like crystal on his ring flashed, and the long Sea Moon's Clear Radiance Zither floated out onto the table. Although the table was a little high, Ye Yin Zhu was tall and slender, so by sitting up straight, he could just about manage to use the tea table as a zither table.\n\n  Chestnut-colored lacquer, cracked-ice patterns, the lustrous glow of the Sea Moon's Clear Radiance Zither exuded an aloof aura. The strings shimmered with a faint cyan light, and the thirteen fret markers, inlaid with pearls, radiated a gentle elegance and the nobility of the instrument.\n\n  \"A fine zither,\" An Ya said, somewhat surprised. She hadn't expected Ye Yin Zhu to acquire such a fine instrument in such a short time.\n\n  His concentration was absolute: his gaze on his nose, his nose on his heart, his heart centered on his core.¹ His breathing evened out. He sat upright before the fifth fret marker, hands resting lightly on the strings, merging the strings of his heart with those of the ancient zither. At this moment, Ye Yin Zhu seemed like a different person. The simple clarity in his eyes had been completely replaced by fascination and devotion. Even though he was wearing the uniform of the Milan Academy of Magic and Combat, the elegance he now radiated was far stronger than that of the most pedigreed nobleman.\n\n  With a slight shake of his hands, he flicked his sleeves away from his wrists, revealing the eight fingers of his hands. His left hand pressed lightly while his right hand, in the \"Spring Oriole Exiting the Valley\" posture, plucked gently. Following a deep, humming sound, the song \"Autumn Swans,\" fitting for the current season, began to quietly resonate.\n\n  Heart and intent were one, intent and zither were one. Perhaps because he was playing for An Ya, it was the first time since coming to the Milan Academy of Magic and Combat that Ye Yin Zhu had truly opened his heart and played freely, without any specific goal. He had deeply grasped the essence of calming the spirit, clearing the mind, and focusing his emotions.\n\n  At this moment, his mind was completely at peace. A relaxed confidence shone in his eyes. Poised and self-assured, his entire spirit, energy, and soul merged with the music into the fabric of heaven and earth. The notes of the zither were like the arriving autumn, expressing its heartfelt admiration. Everything was so harmonious and natural.\n\n  There was no release of red light from Zither Magic. Although Ye Yin Zhu's spirit was fully concentrated, he was simply playing the zither. All the staff present, even the servers on the two floors above the Drifting Orchid Pavilion, stopped what they were doing. Everyone stood quietly in place, listening to the celestial music as its lingering notes curled through the air.\n\n  Perhaps An Ya and Su La didn't understand the intricacies, but as he played with complete concentration, Ye Yin Zhu's right hand successively used the postures: \"Spring Oriole Exiting the Valley,\" \"Wind Startles the Crane's Dance,\" \"Crane Crying in the Shade,\" \"Treasured Goose Holding a Reed,\" \"Lone Wild Duck Watching the Flock,\" \"Shang Yang Goat Drum Dance,\" \"Flying Dragon Seizing the Clouds,\" and \"Mantis Catching the Cicada.\" His left hand supplemented with \"Autumn Osprey Facing the Wind,\" \"Divine Bird Carrying a Message,\" \"Charming Oriole in the Fragrant Forest,\" \"Azure Dragon Entering the Sea,\" \"Perching Phoenix Preening its Feathers,\" \"Civilized Leopard Holding an Object,\" \"Howling Ape Climbing a Tree,\" and \"Echo in the Empty Valley.\" His hands moved like dancing spirits, his divine skill flowing like moving clouds and flowing water. From a purely technical perspective of zither performance, even Qin Shang, were he here, would have to concede defeat. The focus born from a pure-hearted devotion to the zither was something no other Divine Music Master could compare to.\n\n  The weather had grown cool, and autumn had awakened, wandering about as gracefully as a startled swan. The joy of the harvest and a trace of fear for the coming winter were deeply imprinted upon everyone's hearts, enveloped by that celestial sound. The ancient charm lingered, the notes of the zither lingered. The shared vibration of the zither's strings and the heart's strings brought forth this moving rendition of \"Autumn Swans.\"\n\n  *Omm—* the final vibrating note faded into the distance. Ye Yin Zhu gently lifted his hands, then slowly lowered them back onto the strings, bringing everything to silence. A brilliant light shone in his eyes. In that wholehearted performance, he had gained some new understanding of the zither's mysteries. Vaguely, Ye Yin Zhu felt that his Zither Magic was on the verge of a breakthrough.\n\n  Silence. Throughout the Drifting Orchid Pavilion, the only sound left was the rustling of leaves in the wind. In the first-floor hall, everyone's gaze was fixed on Ye Yin Zhu, their expressions entranced. Even without deliberately infusing his spiritual energy into the music, the evocative power of \"Autumn Swans\" had drawn them all deep within it.\n\n  \"The seven strings are a true friend, the two ears are a soulmate. When the heart is still, the sound is subtle; its appreciation knows no past or present. A fine zither, a fine melody. I don't know how many years it's been since I've heard music so moving.\" An aged voice came from the entrance, startling everyone out of the music's lingering echo.\n\n***\n*Qidian.com welcomes all readers.

    "content": "Fellow readers, please add this to your collections and vote. Thank you.\n\n—————————————————————————————-\n\n\"A fine qin, truly a fine qin.\" An Ya let out a long breath, a new light in her eyes as she looked at Ye Yin Zhu. She never would have imagined that Ye Yin Zhu's skill with the qin was so superb. The piece had moved her so much that she found herself somewhat lost in it, even reminding her of her hometown.\n\nIt wasn't Sula's first time hearing Ye Yin Zhu play, but it was the most complete performance. Without the direct spiritual impact of Qin Magic, he was completely immersed in the profound mystery brought by the music. The moving, heavenly melody also made him recall many, many things, almost bringing him to tears.\n\n\"Pardon my clumsy performance. I haven't had much time to practice at the academy lately, so I was afraid I'd gotten rusty.\" The music could bring beauty to others, and it could bring the same wonderful feeling to Ye Yin Zhu. Playing a near-perfect rendition of \"Autumn Swan\" left him feeling refreshed and invigorated, his entire body filled with an indescribable comfort. A pure energy floated between his heart and lungs, and his whole body seemed to enter a specific rhythm. In this state, his Qin Magic power was increasing naturally.\n\n\"Miss An Ya, I never thought you would invite such a noble qin master, and one so young at that. It seems if I don't report here every day from now on, I'll be doing a great disservice to my ears! Hahahaha.\" The aged and resonant voice rang out again, this time addressing An Ya.\n\nYe Yin Zhu turned to look in the direction the voice came from and saw an old man in a long green robe walking toward the three of them. From the poem the old man had recited earlier, Ye Yin Zhu knew that he must have a deep understanding of qin music. He quickly stood up and said respectfully, \"Good day, venerable sir.\"\n\nThe old man was very tall, with simple and dignified features. Though his clothes were plain, he gave off an extraordinary air, like a proud, ancient pine standing tall. As his eyes opened and closed, a sharp, soul-piercing light would occasionally flash through them. A head of long, silver-white hair was draped casually over his shoulders.\n\n\"Virtue is the foundation of character, and music is the flower of virtue. Through the sound of the qin, one sees the player's virtue. Little brother, your qin playing is so fine, which speaks volumes about your character. Not bad, not bad at all. Fine young men like you are a rare sight these days.\" After speaking, he appreciatively patted Ye Yin Zhu's shoulder. His hand was large, warm, and strong. With the light pats, Ye Yin Zhu felt a thread of warmth enter his body and circulate once, bringing with it a comfortable sensation. The Bamboo Dou Qi within him seemed to increase slightly under its pull.\n\nSeeing the old man approach, An Ya did not stand up. Instead, a chill fell over her face as she said flatly, \"The old horse really does know the way;¹ you certainly arrived early. A pity you had to ruin my mood.\"\n\nA wry smile appeared on the old man's face. \"Alright, alright, my mistake. But, Miss An Ya, will I be able to hear such moving qin music here in the future? A qin master who can truly grasp the profound essence of the four ideals—clarity, subtlety, simplicity, and distance—is far, far too rare.\"\n\nHearing the old man praise Ye Yin Zhu, a slight smile finally appeared on An Ya's face. She turned to Yin Zhu and said, \"You heard him. This is a regular at my Floating Orchid Pavilion, and his tastes are quite picky. If even he praises you like this, my keeping you here as a qin master isn't an act of favoritism, is it? You can't refuse to accept payment for your labor now.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu turned to look at Sula, who still hadn't fully recovered from the music and didn't respond.\n\n\"Alright. A job is a job anywhere, and here I can see you often, Sister.\" A pure, untainted smile appeared on Ye Yin Zhu's face. For him, playing the qin was the best form of cultivation. If he could also earn some tuition and living expenses, what reason was there to refuse?\n\n\"What... what did you call her?\" The old man stared at Ye Yin Zhu, dumbfounded, then quickly turned to An Ya. \"He's your younger brother?\"\n\nAn Ya said coldly, \"My business is none of your concern. One more word and you can leave. Floating Orchid Pavilion will no longer welcome you.\"\n\nA bitter look flashed across the old man's face. \"Can't your temper be a little better? In any case, we're old friends.\" Judging by age, the old man could easily be An Ya's grandfather, but his tone seemed exceedingly respectful toward her.\n\nAn Ya ignored him and turned to Ye Yin Zhu. \"Yin Zhu, how much do you want for your wages?\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu scratched his head, incidentally revealing the blue ring on his left hand. Seeing the ring, the old man beside him stiffened, and his expression grew a little strange.\n\n\"Sister An Ya, the pay doesn't really matter. Sula is my roommate; can he stay and work here with me? We don't need much, ten silver coins a day would be enough for our expenses.\"\n\nBy now, Sula had come to his senses. Hearing Ye Yin Zhu ask for a waiter's wages, he couldn't help but pinch him from behind in frustration and quickly interjected, \"I don't mind, as long as I'm not separated from Yin Zhu. But Yin Zhu is a qin master; can't his pay be a little higher? A qin master as good as him isn't easy to find. Yin Zhu is a genius among the first-year freshmen of the Divine Music department.\"\n\nAn Ya ignored Sula and looked only at Ye Yin Zhu. \"Silly boy, what qin master is paid so little? Here, even an ordinary waiter earns one gold coin a day. I know you have a peaceful nature and don't care much for money. How about this: your wage will be ten gold coins a day. As for this young brother Sula, he can stay here and work as a waiter. One more person doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"No, no, Sister An Ya, that's really too much.\" Ten gold coins a day. That was ten gold coins! An ordinary family's expenses for an entire month were only one or two gold coins.\n\nAn Ya smiled. \"As long as I think it's worth it, that's all that matters. If you don't believe me, ask this Old Mister Ma if your music is worth that price.\"\n\nBefore Ye Yin Zhu could ask, Old Ma had already nodded sincerely. \"It's worth it, absolutely worth it. I'd even say ten gold coins isn't much. How can such beautiful music be measured by money?\"\n\nFor once, An Ya surprisingly didn't refute him. She smiled, \"See? I'm still getting a bargain. It's settled then. Since you're already here today, you can stay and get familiar with the place. From now on, you'll come to work in the afternoons, as that's our main business time. You're both students, so you don't need to come when you have classes, so as not to interfere with your studies.\"\n\nThe terms were exceptionally generous. Never mind Ye Yin Zhu, even Sula's wage of one gold coin a day was unthinkable anywhere else. Where would an ordinary waiter earn that much?\n\nThe Floating Orchid Pavilion was divided into three floors. The first floor was a large hall with ten tea tables. The second floor had six private rooms. The third floor was An Ya's private residence, and even the waiters of the Pavilion were not allowed up there casually. The three-story building, which looked large from the outside, could actually only accommodate sixteen tables of guests at a time.\n\nLunch was sumptuous. Ye Yin Zhu and Sula ate with all the other waiters. The staff at the Floating Orchid Pavilion were all male, and their leader was the same waiter in blue that Ye Yin Zhu and Sula had met earlier.\n\n\"Brother Dida, the Floating Orchid Pavilion is so big, so why are there so few tea tables? Can you even make money this way?\" Ye Yin Zhu asked, a little curious.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  *The old horse really does know the way (老馬識途 - lǎo mǎ shí tú):* A Chinese idiom meaning an experienced person knows what to do. An Ya uses it sarcastically to call the old man a regular who knows exactly when and where to show up.",

    "content": "Three chapters will be released today, and there will be another update before the Highlight Event¹ at midnight. To my friends who enjoy the story, please vote and add it to your collection. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nDida was the only waiter dressed in blue. He looked to be about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, with an ordinary face—the kind that would be easily lost in a crowd. It was unclear if it was because of Ye Yinzhu and An Ya’s special relationship or because the song he played today had stunned the entire audience, but all the waiters were very polite to him. Dida said, \"There are few tables so that every guest who comes here can enjoy the best possible service. Usually, guests are only on the first floor; the six private rooms on the second floor have been booked long-term. After the lunch hour, the crowd will gradually pick up in the afternoon. For example, the Mr. Ma who just came is a regular patron of one of the six second-floor rooms. Miss An Ya instructed me earlier that a special place for you to play the zither will be prepared later in the center of the second floor. Do you have any special requests?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu shook his head and smiled. \"No, I've already troubled Sister An Ya enough. As long as the place where I play is quiet, that's fine. I like places with a good atmosphere, and it's very nice here. This great tree in the center of the Floating Orchid Pavilion is the largest I've ever seen. I really like the air and the environment here.\"\n\nDida nodded. \"I'm glad you like it.\"\n\nAfter lunch, Sula was somewhat reluctantly assigned to work on the first floor, while Ye Yinzhu went up to the second floor with Dida. An Ya did not reappear.\n\nLike the first floor, the second floor of the Floating Orchid Pavilion was built around the giant ancient tree. At this time, on the inner side of the staircase around the tree, a circular platform had been added. On it was a wooden table, and the surrounding frame was surprisingly formed by vines hanging down from the ancient tree, looking very sturdy.\n\nDida pointed to the circular platform and smiled. \"This will be your workplace from now on. When it gets colder, I'll figure out a way to handle the temperature for you. The platform is some distance from the surrounding private rooms, so you can perform in a relatively quiet environment.\"\n\n\"This is wonderful.\" Ye Yinzhu looked at the small blue flowers on the giant tree, feeling its surging life force and natural tranquility, and was overcome with excitement. Playing the zither in such a place would surely be of great help to his future cultivation. If not for his empty pockets, he would gladly pay to be able to play and cultivate in an environment like this!\n\nAs Ye Yinzhu sat down on the platform, Dida lowered the pre-fastened drapery, making it impossible for people outside to see him.\n\nHaving cultivated the *Pure Heart of the Zither* for sixteen years, the zither had already become a part of Ye Yinzhu's life. This was the first time since arriving in Milan that he played just as he had when he was cultivating in the Azure Sky Sea. For the entire afternoon, he was oblivious to everything outside, his body and mind completely immersed in his music. Although he only had the Sea Moon's Pure Radiance Zither, under his wholehearted playing, the graceful melodies seemed to gradually sublimate. For a full four hours in the afternoon, Ye Yinzhu played without interruption, not even noticing when Sula brought him tea. In four hours, not a single piece of music was repeated; the entire Floating Orchid Pavilion was constantly filled with the lingering notes of the zither.\n\nThe Zither Sect's music had eight great ultimate skills: Perceiving the Winds, Capturing the Heart and Soul, Discerning Joy and Anger, Delighting the Emotions and Thoughts, Calming the Spirit and Mind, Strengthening Courage and Bravery, Transcending the Mundane World, and Commanding Ghosts and Gods. Ye Yinzhu had achieved a minor mastery in all eight types of zither magic. At this moment, he suddenly discovered that although he hadn't released his magical power with the music, his understanding of these eight skills seemed to deepen just through the process of playing.\n\nThe sound of the zither quietly faded. Ye Yinzhu thought to himself, *Could this be what Grandpa Qin said, that only by entering society can I make another breakthrough and enter a higher realm of zither magic?*\n\nAs he was pondering this, applause rang out simultaneously from the third floor of the Floating Orchid Pavilion. An Ya, who had appeared at the top of the third-floor stairs at some point, looked down at Ye Yinzhu within the drapery. Only she could see the look of utter concentration on his face. A faint smile appeared on her elegant face.\n\nAn Ya's serene voice sounded out, \"That's all for today. Everyone, you may leave.\" It turned out the Floating Orchid Pavilion was only open in the afternoon.\n\nNo one spoke, only the sound of footsteps, light and heavy. In a short while, the Floating Orchid Pavilion became quiet once more.\n\n\"Sister An Ya.\" Ye Yinzhu emerged from behind the drapery.\n\n\"Yinzhu, you play so well. You must be tired. You haven't moved from that spot all afternoon. Rest for a bit, I'll have someone prepare dinner.\" An Ya looked at Ye Yinzhu with some concern, but she couldn't see a trace of fatigue on his face. Instead, his bright eyes had become even clearer.\n\n\"There's no need, Sister An Ya. I have to return to the academy; I still have some things to do. I'll come back tomorrow. I can come for the next seven days, but it's not certain after school starts. Although my classes are all in the morning, I don't know if I can make it in time.\" An Ya gave him a very warm feeling, which made him very comfortable.\n\n\"Alright then, be careful on your way.\" An Ya didn't insist he stay, just gave Ye Yinzhu a slight smile and had Dida see him downstairs.\n\n\"Yinzhu, are you tired?\" Sula, having changed out of his waiter's blue clothes, was already waiting for him in his Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts uniform.\n\nYe Yinzhu shook his head and smiled. \"I used to play the zither for much longer than this every day, how could I be tired? This place gives me such a good feeling. The rich natural aura makes it easy for my heart to calm down, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the music.\"\n\nThe two left the Floating Orchid Pavilion and walked back toward the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts along the same route.\n\n\"Yinzhu, do you have any idea who that Miss An Ya really is?\" Sula asked suddenly.\n\nYe Yinzhu paused. \"Isn't Sister An Ya the owner of the Floating Orchid Pavilion? What's wrong?\"\n\nSula shook his head. \"No, it's definitely not that simple. When you started playing this afternoon, all sixteen tables on the first and second floors of the Floating Orchid Pavilion filled up with guests. But the strange thing was, no one was loud; even when they spoke, they were very quiet. These people were even dressed in blue or cyan clothes, somewhat similar to us waiters. But I could tell that the guests at the Floating Orchid Pavilion are no ordinary people. They just sat there quietly, drinking tea or chatting in low voices. It seemed like they all came here often.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said, \"What's so strange about that? Not being loud can just mean the guests have good manners.\"\n\nSula said, \"But, do you know how much the flower tea at the Floating Orchid Pavilion costs?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu shook his head blankly.\n\nSula sneered. \"A cup of flower tea at the Floating Orchid Pavilion costs one ruby coin, and that's just for the regular kind. For the guests in the private rooms on the second floor, each cup of tea costs three ruby coins. Each refill costs another ruby coin. Have you ever seen tea that expensive? No wonder that Miss An Ya was so generous, giving you a salary of ten gold coins a day. Compared to the Floating Orchid Pavilion's income, our earnings are an absolute drop in the bucket.\"\n\n\"What? That expensive. Then does that mean the Crimson Globe Amaranth tea we had this afternoon...\"\n\nSula said, \"You see what's wrong now, don't you? I think this Floating Orchid Pavilion seems very mysterious. We should probably stop going.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu shook his head. \"How can we do that? I already promised Sister An Ya I would go and play. Besides, the Floating Orchid Pavilion is very suitable for me. I can earn my tuition and cultivate my zither skills at the same time; there's definitely no second place like it. Sister An Ya is very kind to me; she's a good person. Trust me, Sula, she's really a good person. I can feel the pure, natural aura on her. Only someone with a pure heart would give me that kind of feeling. I can't be wrong.\"\n\nSula said, sounding a bit helpless, \"Since you've put it that way, there's nothing more for me to say. I'm just advising you to be careful. Still, the music you played today was truly amazing. The guests were all listening as if entranced, and many were whispering among themselves, speculating about your origins. It's just that none of them could have guessed you're just a student at the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts. In the end, if it weren't for Miss An Ya's order to leave, I don't think they would have been willing to go. They still wanted to see what kind of master you were.\"\n\n***\nFootnotes:\n¹: \"Highlight Event\" (加精大會) is a term from Chinese web novel forums where an author or moderator highlights or \"pins\" excellent reader comments as a form of community engagement.",

    "content": "I'm going to my parents' house for dinner, so I'm uploading this a bit early for everyone. There will be another chapter at 12:00 today, and the 'featured comments' session will take place as usual at 12:05. All friends are welcome to join.\n\n---\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled faintly. \"Actually, one plays the zither mainly for oneself, for one's own heart to hear. Grandpa Qin once said there are seven principles to playing the zither: First, to clarify morality. Second, to move ghosts and spirits. Third, to beautify customs. Fourth, to clarify the mind and sharpen observation. Fifth, to control sound and tone. Sixth, to express elegance. And seventh, to be good at teaching. The virtue of the zither comes before the art of the zither. Only when the heart is righteous can the heartstrings align with the zither strings; otherwise, one cannot play beautiful music.\"\n\nSula said with heartfelt sincerity, \"It seems there are truly no useless professions, only useless people! In you, I can really see hope for the Divine Music Magi. Just now, I heard you tell Anya upstairs that you had something to do back at the academy. What could you possibly have to do?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu pondered for a moment. \"I need to find Haiyang.\"\n\nSula chuckled. \"What do you want with her? Didn't you get to hold her enough yesterday?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu blushed, saying with a hint of anger, \"Yesterday wasn't on purpose. I'm looking for Haiyang because of her face.\"\n\nSula froze, looking at Ye Yinzhu in surprise. \"Because of her face? Haiyang is pitiful enough already, you're not going to kick her while she's down, are you? Actually, if her face wasn't injured, she would definitely be a stunning beauty.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said, annoyed, \"Am I the kind of person who would kick someone while they're down? Besides, a person's beauty or ugliness isn't absolute. If a girl is very pretty but has a bad heart, she's still an ugly woman.\"\n\nSula's expression changed slightly. \"Then what do you want with Haiyang?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said, \"I want to see if I can help treat her. I can tell that her current mentality and cold exterior are largely due to the marks on her face. It must be very painful for a girl to be disfigured. Her facial injuries seem to have been acquired later in life, so perhaps there's still a chance for recovery.\"\n\nSula stared blankly at Ye Yinzhu. \"You're saying you also know healing? But Haiyang's face is something even the most powerful light-element mages probably couldn't cure! Did you know? The family Haiyang belongs to is the last of the three great families, the Ancelotti family. Her grandfather is the Milan Empire's other Purple Star Dragon Knight General, Imperial Marshal Seedorf. Marshal Seedorf has two sons, and Haiyang's father is his eldest, who married the younger sister of the current Milan Emperor, Berlusconi IX. And they only have this one daughter, which means Haiyang is a relative of the imperial family. Even if she isn't highly regarded in her family because of her appearance, they've definitely hired the best physicians to treat her. I don't think you stand much of a chance. You're not just trying to repay her because you held her yesterday, are you?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu sighed softly. \"When I saw her face during the match yesterday, I already wanted to try and help treat her. My healing methods are different from others'. Even if there's just a sliver of a chance, we shouldn't give up on it! Otherwise, wouldn't she have to live her whole life in pain?\"\n\nSula gave Ye Yinzhu a long, deep look. \"Yinzhu, you're the silliest fool I've ever met, but also the cutest one. I'll go with you, to avoid any awkwardness with you two being a lone man and woman together.\"\n\nBy the time they returned to the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy, the sky had already darkened. The two of them first went back to their dormitory for a simple dinner before heading towards the Divine Music Department student dormitories. Neither Ye Yinzhu nor Sula knew where Haiyang lived, but aside from Ye Yinzhu in the mixed area for work-study students, all the Divine Music Department students lived together, so it was easy to find.\n\n\"Hey, isn't this Yinzhu? What brings you here?\" Just as Ye Yinzhu and Sula arrived at the Divine Music Department dormitory area, they ran into Xue Ling. At that moment, Xue Ling was wearing a long nightgown, combing her long hair in front of her villa-style dormitory, looking as if she were about to turn in for the night.\n\n\"I'm here to find Senior Sister Haiyang. Xue Ling, do you know where she lives?\"\n\nXue Ling giggled. \"All you can think about is your Senior Sister Haiyang, even fainting right onto her. Have you fallen for her? Want me to be your matchmaker?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu blushed, too embarrassed to know what to say. Seeing his窘迫 look, Xue Ling couldn't help but laugh even louder. \"You live up to your reputation as our Divine Music Department's number one cute boy. Yinzhu, don't tell me you're still a virgin?\"\n\nBeside them, Sula rolled his eyes, thinking to himself that the female students of the Divine Music Department were certainly very forward.\n\n\"Um, Xue Ling, do you know where Senior Sister Haiyang lives? I really have business with her.\" Being asked such an awkward question, Ye Yinzhu was even more at a loss for words, the blush on his face spreading all the way to the roots of his ears.\n\nXue Ling smiled. \"Alright, I'll stop teasing you. Follow this path all the way to the end. Senior Sister Haiyang's dorm is the very last one. She's not very sociable and doesn't talk much usually. I really can't see what you like about her.\"\n\n\"I... I don't.\" Ye Yinzhu hurriedly tried to explain, but looking at Xue Ling's teasing smile, he couldn't get the words out. He quickly followed the path Xue Ling had pointed out and left as if fleeing. Watching his departing figure, Xue Ling couldn't help but burst out laughing, completely unconcerned that Sula was still standing next to him.\n\nFollowing the small path all the way to the end, the blush on Ye Yinzhu's face finally faded completely when he saw the small white villa at the very back. Sula seemed to enjoy seeing Ye Yinzhu blush, and simply smiled quietly on the way without saying a word.\n\nYe Yinzhu walked up to the villa's door and knocked lightly. \"Senior Sister Haiyang, are you there?\"\n\nBefore long, the door opened, and a face of unforgettable, stunning beauty appeared before Ye Yinzhu. It wasn't Haiyang, but the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy's number one beauty, Xiang Luan.\n\nTheir eyes met, and both of them froze, saying in unison, \"Why is it you?\"\n\nThis was the first time Ye Yinzhu had seen Xiang Luan up close. At this moment, she was wearing a long pink dress. As the weather had already grown a bit cold, the dress was very conservative, covering every inch of her skin. Her large, light purple eyes revealed a trace of panic upon seeing Ye Yinzhu. Her golden-pink hair cascaded down from her left shoulder, covering her ample left breast.\n\n*Did Xue Ling trick me? This isn't Haiyang's dorm?* Ye Yinzhu wondered doubtfully.\n\n\"Ye Yinzhu, are you here to see Haiyang?\" It was Xiang Luan who broke the awkward silence first.\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes.\" Ye Yinzhu quickly replied, asking tentatively, \"Is this Senior Sister Haiyang's dormitory?\"\n\nXiang Luan smiled faintly. \"You two should come in first. Haiyang is upstairs, I'll go get her.\" As she spoke, she stepped aside, letting Ye Yinzhu and Sula into the villa's main hall before heading upstairs.\n\nThe villa's interior was decorated in cool blue tones, just like the coldness that emanated from Haiyang. The furnishings were simple, and one could feel a faint chill just by stepping through the door.\n\nSula said in a low voice, \"Your Senior Sister Haiyang is wasting her talent as a Divine Music Magus. I think she'd be better suited to studying the dark element.\"\n\nAt that moment, Ye Yinzhu could only feel his heart pounding violently. He didn't know why, but he had this reaction every time he saw Xiang Luan, and he almost didn't dare to look at her perfect, beautiful face.\n\nBefore long, accompanied by Xiang Luan, Haiyang came down the stairs. She was wearing a dress of the same style as Xiang Luan's, only in white, her black hair hanging softly over her shoulders. Her appearance was not much different from usual. The moment she saw Ye Yinzhu, her expression was slightly unnatural, and a faint blush rose on the exposed half of her face, clearly remembering what had happened the night before.\n\nSeeing Haiyang, Ye Yinzhu's heart was not calm either. What had happened the previous night, coupled with Xue Ling's earlier teasing, stirred a strange feeling within him, and his face began to turn red again.\n\nQidian Chinese Network <www.cmfu.com> welcomes all readers.

While our fellow readers are grabbing for essence posts, don't forget to vote for Xiao San.¹ Thank you.\n\n—————————————————————————————-\n\nXiang Luan let out a chuckle and said, \"What are you two doing? It's like you're on a blind date. Ye Yinzhu, what brings you to see our Haiyang? Haiyang came back very late after taking you home yesterday. I asked her where she'd been, but she wouldn't say a word. Did you bully her?\"\n\n\"I, I...\" Ye Yinzhu didn't know if his actions yesterday counted as bullying Haiyang, and for a moment, he truly couldn't answer.\n\n\"Sister Xiang Luan, don't bully him. He's an honest person,\" Haiyang finally spoke up. Her voice was as cold as ever, but now there was a hint of panic within its iciness.\n\nXiang Luan smiled. \"Already defending him, are we? Ye Yinzhu, just say it! What did you come here for?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu took a deep breath. He suddenly felt that these girls were each more formidable than the last; talking to them seemed to make one an easy target for teasing. \"I came to thank Senior Haiyang for her help yesterday.\"\n\n\"No thanks are needed. You were the one who saved us first during the match,\" Haiyang replied coolly, her gaze having returned to normal by now.\n\n\"Also, I want to try and see if I can heal your face,\" Ye Yinzhu hurriedly added the second half of his sentence.\n\n\"What did you say? You can heal Haiyang's face?\" Xiang Luan stared at Ye Yinzhu in astonishment, her beautiful eyes filled with surprise and delight.\n\nHaiyang's expression, however, changed drastically, her gaze instantly turning frigid. \"You should go. I don't need your help.\" Even Sula, standing behind Ye Yinzhu, could feel the coldness radiating from her. He couldn't help but curse Ye Yinzhu in his mind. *What an idiot. How could he bring up a girl's sore spot so directly? It's obvious Haiyang has strong self-esteem. Isn't he just asking for trouble?*\n\nNaturally, Ye Yinzhu didn't understand the psychology of girls and quickly said, \"Senior Haiyang, while I'm not completely certain, I can give it a try. Your face should have been injured before. We're classmates, and I just want to help you.\"\n\nJust as Haiyang was about to refuse, Xiang Luan, who was beside her, cut in, \"Haiyang, since he dared to come find you, maybe he really has a way? Just let him try.\"\n\nHaiyang let out a soft sigh. She also understood that Ye Yinzhu hadn't intentionally touched upon the pain in her heart. The ice in her eyes thawed slightly as she said faintly, \"There's no need. Since I was young, haven't enough people tried to treat me, from doctors to Light-element mages? I don't want to be disappointed again. Ye Yinzhu, thank you for your kind intentions, but you should go.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu hadn't expected Haiyang to be so aloof. \"Senior, I just want to help you. The injury on your face should be corrosive damage caused by dark-element magic, and it most likely carries a curse effect as well. Although this kind of magic can be cleansed with Light-element magic, the damage that has already been done cannot be healed by it. The meridians in your face must be unblocked again, and with subsequent care, only then is it possible to fully recover. I want to try to open up the meridians in your face. If I succeed, there is at least an eighty percent chance you can regain your appearance.\"\n\nHaiyang looked at Ye Yinzhu with a little more surprise, the refusal on her face no longer as pronounced. Xiang Luan, beside her, quickly said, \"Haiyang, let him try. He has already brought a miracle to the Divine Music Department. Who knows, maybe he can bring one to you, too?\"\n\nHaiyang's eyes showed a flicker of struggle before she slowly nodded. \"Alright, then. What do you need to do?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu pointed to a nearby sofa and said, \"Senior Haiyang, please have a seat first.\"\n\nHaiyang sat down as told. Xiang Luan and Sula stood on either side, both wanting to see how Ye Yinzhu planned to treat Haiyang. After all, the corrosive damage from dark-element magic was the most difficult to heal, not to mention the scars on Haiyang's face were caused by a spell that also carried a curse effect.\n\nYe Yinzhu walked over to Haiyang, raised his hand, and gently lifted the black hair that always hung down over her face, tucking it behind her ear. The simple action made Haiyang's body tremble slightly. Although Ye Yinzhu's hand didn't touch her skin, she could clearly feel the warmth from it. His focused gaze, in particular, made Haiyang feel like she was on pins and needles. Her greatest pain and flaw were now completely exposed before this man she barely knew. Even though she had felt a slight fondness for him, Haiyang's heart was still filled with all sorts of complex emotions.\n\n\"I... I don't want it treated anymore.\" Haiyang frantically tried to pull her long hair back, but Xiang Luan held her hand down. \"There, there, Haiyang. Perhaps this is a real opportunity.\" Xiang Luan soothed her, using her other hand to cover Haiyang's eyes so she couldn't see Ye Yinzhu. Only then did Haiyang's tense emotions relax a little.\n\nYe Yinzhu carefully examined Haiyang's face, as focused as if he were looking at an ancient zither. On nearly eighty percent of Haiyang's right cheek, the skin and muscle were atrophied. The surface of the skin was a vicious dark red, giving it a horrifying appearance. Although the corrosive and curse effects of the dark-element magic had already been cleared, the immense damage still stirred a strong sense of pity in Ye Yinzhu's heart. He could fully imagine how much suffering Haiyang had endured because of the injury on her face.\n\nA faint yellow light appeared on Ye Yinzhu's right hand. He carefully placed his four-fingered right hand onto the scars on Haiyang's face.\n\nHaiyang's face was cold, but Ye Yinzhu's hand was very warm. When he touched the scars on her face, her body trembled noticeably. A warm sensation traveled through her cheek like a stream of water, washing over the scarred areas.\n\n\"It's even more serious than I imagined. Some of the meridians are already necrotic.\" Ye Yinzhu lowered his hand, his expression turning somewhat grave.\n\nXiang Luan asked anxiously, \"Can it still be treated then?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu nodded. \"I will try. But it will require multiple treatments to have a chance of a full recovery. Senior Haiyang, you may feel some pain and a tingling itch shortly. Please bear with it.\" As he spoke, he pulled up his own pant leg.\n\nSula and Xiang Luan both saw that, strapped to Ye Yinzhu's right leg, was a pouch made of a cloth-like material. Ye Yinzhu took it off and handed it to Sula, gesturing for him to hold it carefully. Only then did Sula see clearly that it was a cloth pouch with several small, oblong pockets from which a faint purple light emanated.\n\nYe Yinzhu swiped his right hand across the pouch, and instantly, a long purple needle appeared between his index and middle fingers. The needle was about three inches long, purple from end to end, with both tips being extremely sharp. The entire body of the needle radiated a soft purple light.\n\nXiang Luan looked at Ye Yinzhu with some surprise and said, \"What are you doing? What's that needle for?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said, \"These are Purple Bamboo Needles. They only grow in a bamboo forest near my home called the Azure Sea of Bamboo. Around the central Bamboo of Life in the Azure Sea of Bamboo, a total of eighteen purple bamboo stalks grow. Their texture is as hard as iron, and they possess an immense life force and the harmonious power of nature. Each purple bamboo stalk has a core, which can be made into a needle after a special refinement process. In this pouch of mine are a total of eighteen Purple Bamboo Needles, which, with my family's inherited medical arts, can be used to treat some illnesses.\"\n\nBack then, Ye Yinzhu had lost his spatial ring, causing the five priceless ancient zithers of the Zither Sect to be lost at the same time. But luckily, he had kept the treasures of the Bamboo Sect on his person. The Verdant Silk on his wrist and the Purple Bamboo Needles strapped to his calf, while appearing unremarkable, were peerless treasures within the Bamboo Sect. It was Ye Li who, fearing his grandson would suffer out in the world, had given these treasures to him, not even telling Ye Zhong. In his final year at the Azure Sea of Bamboo, Ye Yinzhu, relying on his superhuman focus and intellect, had primarily studied the Verdant Silk and the Purple Bamboo Needles.\n\nXiang Luan was shocked and blurted out, \"Could this be the legendary Divine Needle Acupoint Therapy? Hasn't that medical art been lost to time?\"\n\n***\n\n¹Xiao San, or \"Little San,\" is the author Tang Jia San Shao's nickname for himself.",

With a wave of his right hand, a streak of purple light flashed, and the Purple Bamboo Needle he held had already silently pierced Hai Yang's right cheek.\n\nA slight sting, accompanied by a tingling numbness, didn't cause Hai Yang much discomfort. Hearing Xiang Luan's cry of surprise, a flicker of hope couldn't help but ignite in her heart. If he could really heal the scar on her face, then…\n\n\"Senior Hai Yang, could you please take off your top?\" With a flick of his right hand, Ye Yin Zhu produced two more Purple Bamboo needles from his cloth pouch.\n\n\"What?\" Hai Yang, Xiang Luan, and Su La cried out in unison, their gazes toward Ye Yin Zhu instantly turning strange.\n\nYe Yin Zhu fiddled with the Purple Bamboo Needles in his hand, looking somewhat helpless. \"My needling technique is not very refined, and I don't know much about the female body. I can't perform the acupuncture through clothing, as that could be dangerous. The meridians on Senior Hai Yang's face need to be cleared starting from the upper body, tackling the source of the facial meridians.\"\n\nXiang Luan blurted out without a second thought, \"How can that be acceptable? If you do that, won't you see everything? No, absolutely not.\" As she spoke, she moved to block the space between Ye Yin Zhu and Hai Yang, preventing him from getting closer.\n\nSu La nodded repeatedly. \"Exactly. How can you look at a girl's body?\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu looked at Hai Yang. By now, Xiang Luan had lowered the hand that was covering her eyes. Their gazes met. In Ye Yin Zhu's clear eyes, Hai Yang saw not a trace of lewdness; that pure gaze held only sincerity.\n\nLightly biting her lower lip, Hai Yang's usually cold eyes now showed a hint of determination. She recalled the final moments of the battle against the wind-element students. Ye Yin Zhu had faced a green dragon alone to protect them, without a hint of retreat. His sincere and pure gaze, his calm and refreshing aura, inspired nothing but trust in those around him.\n\n\"Alright, I'll take it off.\" Hai Yang pulled Xiang Luan, who was standing in front of her, to the side. Taking a deep breath, she began to unfasten the buttons on the bodice of her white long dress.\n\n\"Hai Yang, how can you…\" Xiang Luan hastily grabbed her hand, her voice anxious.\n\nHai Yang sighed softly. \"Sister Xiang Luan, didn't you say it just now? Perhaps this is a chance. If he really knows that legendary medical art, then this might be my last chance, too. I'm willing to try. I trust Ye Yin Zhu's character.\"\n\nXiang Luan slowly released her hand, her beautiful eyes filled with nothing but heartache. \"Ye Yin Zhu, she's in your hands.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu felt a surge of excitement. Hai Yang's trust seemed to fill his entire body with inexhaustible strength. The Bamboo Dou Qi within him circulated slowly, and his rhythmic breathing gradually calmed his mind. There could be no room for error in Hai Yang's treatment. The network of meridians in the human face was extremely complex; if anything went wrong, not only would her face not recover, but she might even lose the ability to make facial expressions.\n\n\"Why haven't you left yet? Trying to get a free show?\" Xiang Luan glared at Su La, who was standing behind Ye Yin Zhu.\n\n\"Oh.\" Su La paused for a moment, a complicated look in his eyes as he glanced at Ye Yin Zhu. He then handed the cloth pouch to Xiang Luan. \"Yin Zhu, I'll wait for you outside.\"\n\nOne button was undone, then a second. As the collar of the long dress opened, Hai Yang's slender and graceful neck was gradually revealed. A faint, sweet, and pure fragrance, tinged with a cool scent, stimulated Ye Yin Zhu's senses.\n\nFinally, all the intricate buttons were unfastened. Hai Yang kept her eyes shut, her long eyelashes trembling slightly. With trembling hands, she gently pulled at her top, letting it slide down slowly. More and more of her snow-white skin was revealed, and the natural fragrance emanating from her body grew more distinct.\n\nYe Yin Zhu's expression was calm. Even his breathing did not quicken at the sight of Hai Yang's exposed skin. He didn't understand matters between men and women at all; looking at Hai Yang's skin, as white and translucent as snow crystals, only stirred a strange feeling in his heart.\n\nHai Yang's top was finally off. Since it was a one-piece dress, it draped at her waist, leaving her upper body covered only by a tube top that guarded her firm, full bosom. *So Senior Hai Yang's chest muscles are this strong, too!* Ye Yin Zhu thought. Fortunately, he remembered An Ya's earlier warning and didn't ask it out loud.\n\nHer arms were as white as lotus roots, her shoulders sloped with delicate, beautiful lines. She looked so fragile. Her slender waist could be encircled by a single hand. From any angle, her perfect curves were a masterpiece of creation.\n\n\"D-do I have to take off more?\" Hai Yang asked uneasily, her hands resting lightly on her tube top.\n\n\"No, this is fine.\" Ye Yin Zhu's reply was a great relief to her. She kept her eyes squeezed shut, her full bosom rising and falling with her rapid breaths.\n\nYe Yin Zhu took two steps forward, his clear gaze turning solemn. \"Senior, no matter what you feel, do not move. You must not move. I'm about to begin.\"\n\nSu La stood outside the door, discovering that he was in a very foul mood. He didn't know if it was because Ye Yin Zhu was seeing Hai Yang's bare torso, or because of his own conversation with Ye Yin Zhu earlier that day. For some reason, he felt extremely agitated. Just then, Xiang Luan's voice drifted out from the villa.\n\n\"Ye Yin Zhu, you made Hai Yang take off her clothes. If you're not up to it, don't blame me for getting rough with you.\"\n\n\"Hey, can you be a little slower? She's a girl, you know. Be gentle, you have to be gentle! Can't you see Hai Yang is frowning?\"\n\n\"Ye Yin Zhu, that thing of yours is so long and thick. Are you sure it's okay to stick it in? Won't it cause any bleeding?\"\n\n...\n\nListening to Xiang Luan's continuous stream of comments, Su La felt a wave of heat wash over his body. Although he knew perfectly well that something else was going on inside, having traveled the continent for years, his mind couldn't help but wander in the wrong direction. His face flushed red, then turned pale. If not for his current identity, he would have stormed in immediately.\n\nHe gently pressed a spot on his belt, and a small, square box appeared in his hands, glowing faintly. His gaze seemed distant, Ye Yin Zhu's words echoing in his ears: *A person's beauty or ugliness isn't absolute. If a girl is very beautiful but has a bad heart, she's still an ugly woman...*\n\n\"Yin Zhu, perhaps... I'm the one you spoke of, the one with a bad heart.\" With a flash of light, the small, square box disappeared again. Feeling the cold and loneliness of the night, Su La's expression was gradually replaced by an icy chill.\n\n...\n\n\"Senior Xiang Luan, could you please be quiet? I can't concentrate at all with you like this.\" Ye Yin Zhu really couldn't take any more of Xiang Luan. Several times, just as he was about to insert a needle, she had stopped him, treating Hai Yang as if she were a porcelain doll that would shatter at a touch.\n\nXiang Luan blushed, realizing she had been a bit too talkative. \"Well, you have to be very careful.\"\n\nWithout Xiang Luan's interruptions, Ye Yin Zhu could finally focus. Two faint beams of purple light shot from his hands, silently embedding themselves in Hai Yang's shoulders, leaving only a small portion of the needle tips exposed. Strangely, Hai Yang seemed not to feel a thing, her body remaining perfectly still.\n\nAlthough Ye Yin Zhu only had eight fingers, they were exceptionally nimble. When he was first training in the healing arts of the Purple Bamboo Needles, his years of practicing the zither had given his fingers such extraordinary flexibility that his progress was twice the result for half the effort. At this moment, his eight fingers moved as if filled with rhythm, constantly drawing Purple Bamboo Needles from the cloth pouch and swiftly inserting them into Hai Yang's body. Including the one on her cheek, there were a total of three needles. In Ye Yin Zhu's Divine Purple Bamboo Needle technique, this was known as the Three-Needle Spirit-Settling.\n\nThe tense expression on Hai Yang's face gradually relaxed, and the aura around her softened. She entered a hazy, dream-like state.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\" target=\"_blank\">Qidian.com</a> welcomes all readers.

As for monthly tickets, please cast them for *Sheng Xiao* first.\n\n—————————————————————————-\n\nYe Yinzhu took the cloth pouch from Xiang Luan's hand, draped it over his left wrist, and stared unblinkingly at Hai Yang before him, seemingly lost in thought. His entire being seemed to enter a peculiar rhythm; standing there silently, he became the center of the entire villa's main hall.\n\nA faint yellow light emanated from his body. Gentle Dou Qi rose and fell with his breath, its soft glow flickering. In an instant, his right hand suddenly swept across the pouch. A cluster of purple, cold flame danced in his palm. Xiang Luan's vision blurred, and the purple flame burst like a firework, transforming into streaks of purple light that vanished without a sound. Fifteen Purple Bamboo Needles had already completely submerged into Hai Yang's body.\n\nHai Yang let out a muffled groan, seemingly enduring great pain, and her body began to tremble violently.\n\nYe Yinzhu moved. His footwork was profound and mysterious. With his first step, he arrived at Hai Yang's side. His right hand moved in a continuous motion, pulling out three Purple Bamboo Needles. A faint yellow Dou Qi was injected from the ends of the needles, and in the blink of an eye, he reinserted them into three different spots. Without any pause in his movements, he took another step, again pulling and inserting three needles. His actions were as smooth as flowing clouds and moving water. Accompanied by his yellow Dou Qi, he began to revolve rapidly around Hai Yang's body. The shimmering light of his Dou Qi completely enveloped Hai Yang, making it difficult for Xiang Luan to see her clearly from the outside.\n\nA faint, refreshing fragrance wafted through the villa's main hall—not Hai Yang's natural scent, but a captivating aroma of bamboo.\n\nXiang Luan's eyes widened as she looked closely at Hai Yang. Only then did she realize that the Purple Bamboo Needles on Hai Yang's body were no longer being removed and reinserted. Ye Yinzhu was now twisting the already-placed needles at an incredible speed. There were eighteen long needles in total: six on Hai Yang's cheeks, and the other twelve on the back of her head, her shoulders, her chest, and her back. A faint purple mist was now rising from the ends of all eighteen Purple Bamboo Needles. The bamboo fragrance seemed to originate from it.\n\nYe Yinzhu's phantom-like figure gradually slowed. Each of his movements transitioned from light and graceful to heavy and deliberate, as if it took a great deal of effort just to twist the long purple needles.\n\nThe Divine Needle Acupoint Stimulation Therapy placed extremely high demands on its practitioner. It required not only abundant Dou Qi but also the most meticulous probing of the patient's condition. When he first inserted the needles, Ye Yinzhu was probing the condition of Hai Yang's body and facial scars. Once he truly began the treatment, the control of his Bamboo Dou Qi became paramount; not the slightest deviation was permissible. This placed an extreme demand on his spiritual energy. The dual consumption of Dou Qi and spiritual energy had already soaked his robes in sweat. If he hadn't cultivated the Heart of a Child Zither since youth, which often put him in a state of pure focus, it would have been difficult to sustain this level of unwavering concentration for so long.\n\nAt this moment, Ye Yinzhu realized that his Dou Qi had indeed improved. After forming the Equal Life Contract with Zi, his Bamboo Dou Qi had advanced to the second rank of Yellow Bamboo, becoming much more robust than before. Furthermore, the wisp of Dou Qi that the guest An Ya called \"Old Ma\" had infused into his body today also seemed to have caused a slight change, making his own Dou Qi a bit more condensed. That was why he still didn't feel exhausted.\n\nHai Yang, of course, had no idea how much effort Ye Yinzhu was exerting. At the beginning, the needles on her face only brought a numb, itching sensation. But as all eighteen Purple Bamboo Needles fully entered her body and Ye Yinzhu's Bamboo Dou Qi began to flow in through them, varying degrees of pain started to spread across her entire upper body. One moment it was a stabbing pain, the next a burning heat, then an itch that seemed to reach deep into her heart. She couldn't help but let out a soft moan. She wanted to raise her hands to scratch, but found that she couldn't lift her arms at all; she couldn't even move her upper body.\n\nIn order to better place the needles, Ye Yinzhu had already used the Purple Bamboo Needles to seal her meridians. Otherwise, if Hai Yang were to move erratically during the procedure, any deviation in the needle placement or the flow of Dou Qi would have rendered all his previous efforts useless.\n\nThe bamboo fragrance in the air gradually faded. The purple vapor emanating from the ends of the Purple Bamboo Needles seemed to have been completely infused into Hai Yang's body, causing a hazy purple film to appear on the surface of her upper body's skin. Her originally fair and translucent skin took on an added air of nobility.\n\nIn truth, the Purple Bamboo Divine Needle technique Ye Yinzhu was performing wasn't purely the Divine Needle Acupoint Stimulation Therapy that Xiang Luan had mentioned. Traditional Divine Needle Acupoint Stimulation Therapy used various needles of different thicknesses, most often made of metal. The Purple Bamboo Needles Ye Yinzhu was using now, however, were far superior to metal needles in terms of effect alone. Although Purple Bamboo wasn't as precious as the Bamboo of Life, it was absolutely the finest of the fine among bamboos, earning it the title \"Guardian Bamboo,\" as it only grew around the Bamboo of Life. Not only was it extremely tough, but the special life aura and detoxifying properties it contained were comparable to spiritual medicine, placing it in the category of heavenly materials and earthly treasures. After being processed with the Bamboo Sect's special refining techniques over hundreds of years, only two complete sets of Purple Bamboo Needles had ever been made. When used to perform the Divine Needle Acupoint Stimulation Therapy, the Purple Bamboo Needles' inherent effects—expelling evil, detoxifying, regenerating flesh, and clearing meridians—were completely unleashed when stimulated by Ye Yinzhu's Bamboo Dou Qi. If it weren't for the Purple Bamboo Needles, how could he have been so confident in coming to treat Hai Yang?\n\nGradually, the scent of bamboo vanished, replaced by a faint, acrid smell. Beads of sweat trickled down Ye Yinzhu's temples and chin. A look of exhaustion was already beginning to show in his eyes. Steam rose from his body as if he were in a steamer. His faint yellow Bamboo Dou Qi had begun to wane, its color growing paler and paler.\n\nThe pained expression on Hai Yang's face never faded. Under the assault of the various, constantly changing pains, she felt as if she were seeing frequent illusions and was beginning to lose her sense of self. In a way, this actually lessened the pain somewhat.\n\nHis slow steps suddenly quickened. Ye Yinzhu gave a low shout, \"Rise.\" Eighteen streaks of purple light shot out simultaneously. With a turn of his body, all eighteen Purple Bamboo Needles landed back in the cloth pouch, not one missing.\n\nGasping for breath, Ye Yinzhu staggered, nearly falling. The treatment had unexpectedly taken a full *shichen*¹.\n\nXiang Luan stepped forward and supported Ye Yinzhu. \"Are you alright?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu waved his hand and said wearily, \"I'm fine. Fortunately, I did not fail my mission. Senior Sister Hai Yang has a chance to recover.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Xiang Luan looked at Hai Yang in joyful surprise. From the eighteen pinpricks where the Purple Bamboo Needles had just been inserted, eighteen streams of a black fluid were slowly trickling down Hai Yang's mostly bare upper body. The acrid smell grew stronger, but the color returned to Hai Yang's face, and her expression softened. The shrunken scars on her face, originally a dark red, had turned pink. Although the puckering of the scars hadn't changed, they no longer looked as terrifying as before.\n\n\"Is Hai Yang cured?\"\n\n---\n¹ A *shichen* is a traditional Chinese unit of time equal to two hours.",

For monthly tickets, please vote for *Sheng Xiao* first.\n\n—————————————————————————-\n\nYe Yinzhu said, \"A single treatment isn't enough. I need to use the Purple Bamboo Needles to gradually clear the meridians in her face, allowing the necrotic and atrophied meridians to regain their vitality. Then, I will gradually purge the residual poison hidden within her meridians. From now on, I will need to apply the needles once a week for about ten sessions in total. There should be a noticeable change. As for how much she can ultimately recover, I can't be certain. But at the very least, her appearance should be restored by more than seventy percent.\"\n\nWatching Ye Yinzhu and listening to his panting, weary voice, Xiang Luan suddenly realized that this first male student in the history of the Divine Music Department, who had won such great honor for them, actually seemed quite cute. His pure gaze was like a child's, and what endeared him to Xiang Luan the most was Ye Yinzhu's guileless sincerity, completely devoid of ulterior motives.\n\n\"I thank you on Hai Yang's behalf. Regardless of whether you succeed, we will be grateful for your help.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu gave a faint smile as waves of dizziness and intense fatigue assaulted his mind. \"There's no need for thanks. I just don't want to see Senior Hai Yang remain so melancholy. A girl who has suffered such an injury must be in great pain. Senior Xiang Luan, don't worry, I will do everything in my power to heal her. Well, I should be going. Please help her wipe herself down. The fluid that was discharged is the poison that was in her body. Some of it has been cleared this time, so she should feel a little more comfortable. I have to go now.\"\n\n\"Rest a bit before you leave,\" Xiang Luan said hurriedly.\n\nYe Yinzhu shook his head, biting the tip of his tongue and using the sharp pain to clear his head a little before opening the door and leaving.\n\nWatching Ye Yinzhu's departing figure, Xiang Luan smiled—a smile of heartfelt appreciation. She said softly, \"Ye Yinzhu, you have a heart of gold.\"\n\n\"Yinzhu, what's wrong with you?\" Sula quickly supported the staggering Ye Yinzhu, looking at him in alarm.\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled. \"It's nothing, I'm just a little tired. Let's go back.\"\n\nSula sighed softly. \"Oh, you! I really don't know what to say to you. Here, I'll support you.\" As he spoke, he draped Yinzhu's arm over his own thin shoulder and headed toward the mixed-district dormitory. A look of pained concern was evident in his eyes, but because of the dimness of the night, coupled with Ye Yinzhu's own mental exhaustion, it went unnoticed.\n\nThe cool evening wind was indescribably comfortable against his skin, and Ye Yinzhu's mood was even lighter than the breeze itself. He had never expected anything in return for treating Hai Yang, but now, he found that he had gained a great deal. The feeling of exhilaration after helping someone was something that nothing else could replace. So this is how good it feels to help people.\n\nA mellow smile appeared at the corners of his mouth. Feeling the autumn wind on his face, he discovered that he was growing to like this Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy more and more.\n\n***\n\nDivine Music Department Dormitory.\n\n\"What's... what's wrong with me?\" Hai Yang groggily came to. The sky outside was still dark. Xiang Luan was sitting by her side, wiping her body with a warm towel.\n\n\"Feeling better?\" Xiang Luan asked with concern.\n\nHai Yang paused for a moment, only then recalling everything that had happened. She said with a touch of bitterness, \"He's gone?\"\n\nXiang Luan nodded.\n\nHai Yang sighed softly, her gaze distant and cold. \"I know I never had any hope of recovering in this lifetime. I shouldn't have troubled him. He's a kind and enthusiastic person.\"\n\nXiang Luan stifled a laugh. \"And here I thought you were going to say that you shouldn't have let him see your body.\"\n\nHai Yang's face reddened. \"Sister, how can you say that? Can't you see he's different from ordinary people? Which of the male students from the other departments doesn't avoid me after seeing the scar on my face? Only he has never once made me feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nXiang Luan smiled. \"It seems this Ye Yinzhu has really touched your heart.\"\n\nHai Yang's expression changed slightly, and she shook her head. \"Sister, don't talk nonsense. Yinzhu is a good person, but it's impossible for us. You know that I gave up on matters of love and romance long ago.\"\n\nXiang Luan said, \"Why give up? Have you forgotten the vow you made when you were little? You said that if anyone could heal the wound on your face, you would marry him in gratitude, no matter who he was or how old he was. Now such a handsome young boy is right in front of you. Even I'm a little envious.\"\n\n\"Sister, you...\" Hai Yang suddenly realized something. Her dull gaze gradually grew strange as she looked at Xiang Luan. In a trembling voice, she asked, \"Are you saying... he... he actually succeeded?\"\n\nXiang Luan picked up a bronze mirror from the side and handed it to Hai Yang, smiling. \"See for yourself.\"\n\nTaking the mirror with trembling hands, Hai Yang struggled to calm her heart before she dared to look at her reflection.\n\nHer pale face was tinged with a rosy hue, and her black hair was slightly messy from sweat. The scar on her face had not disappeared; it was still viciously present in its original place. But the feeling of disappointment didn't last long. In just an instant, Hai Yang noticed a difference. The originally dark red scar had turned pink, and the outermost edge, in particular, was a fresh, bright red. The tender new skin seemed to be gently pulsating, and a faint tingling and itching sensation emanated from the scar.\n\n\"I can feel it. It actually has feeling.\" Hai Yang stared at her reflection in joyful surprise, subconsciously raising her other hand to touch her face. Ever since she was injured as a child, this side of her face had been completely numb. For seventeen years, she was feeling her own face for the first time. Though the sensation was faint, it was like a seed of hope that instantly ignited within her heart.\n\nXiang Luan said, \"Don't ask me how he did it, I don't know either. His movements were very fast at the time. I could only see that he was exhausted, so tired he could barely stand. He said your injury will require multiple treatments, about ten sessions, and your appearance can be restored by at least seventy or eighty percent. So, tell me, shouldn't you fulfill your promise to him?\"\n\nHai Yang was stunned. Tonight was destined to be a sleepless night for her.\n\n***\n\nAt dawn, as the first ray of sunlight streamed through the small dormitory window, Ye Yinzhu awoke from his meditation. The exhaustion and fatigue from the previous night had vanished without a trace, and his entire body was filled with a sense of lightness and strength. Clenching his fists, he couldn't help but mutter to himself, \"When did my recovery ability get so good? This isn't the first time.\"\n\n\"Yinzhu, hurry up and wash, then come eat,\" Sula said, having prepared breakfast as always. Perhaps because he had found a job, there were a few eggs in today's breakfast, making it noticeably more lavish.\n\n\"Sula, where did the eggs come from?\" The aroma of breakfast was almost too much for Ye Yinzhu to bear, but under Sula's burning gaze, he still went to wash up first. He had always thought that Sula was the absolute best housekeeper; at least, he felt helplessly managed by him.\n\n\"Of course I bought them. Did you think they'd fall from the sky?\" Sula huffed irritably. His face looked a little pale, as if he hadn't slept well the night before.\n\nYe Yinzhu said in surprise, \"You bought them? You went this morning? You must have gotten up so early!\"\n\nSula replied matter-of-factly, \"Do you think everyone is as lazy as you, sleeping until dawn? Hurry up and eat.\"\n\nSitting at the narrow dining table, Ye Yinzhu suddenly remembered that a few days ago, during breakfast, he had casually mentioned that eggs were his favorite food as a child. Could it be that Sula...",

For monthly tickets, please vote for *Sheng Xiao* first.\n\n—————————————————\n\nGoing out to buy things from the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy was a hassle, as the academy had its own dining hall. The nearest place that sold ingredients was at least twenty *li*¹ away. You either had to go into Milan City or to a village even farther out. And it was a considerable distance just to walk out of the academy from the mixed dormitory area where they lived.\n\nThere weren't many eggs, only four in total. They were placed on a plate, already peeled, their smooth, white surfaces looking incredibly tempting. For some reason, Ye Yinzhu suddenly felt his eyes grow a little moist.\n\n\"Sula, you have some eggs too!\"\n\n\"I've never liked eggs, not since I was a kid. You're the only one who does. What's so good about them anyway? Alright, I'm full.\" Sula quickly finished the congee in front of him, not even glancing at the eggs, and stood up to wash the dishes.\n\nYe Yinzhu only ate one egg. He carefully wrapped the remaining three in a clean cloth and, hiding it from Sula, placed them into his spatial ring.\n\nJust then, a cold voice suddenly sounded from outside. \"Is Ye Yinzhu here?\"\n\nSula was outside washing the dishes. \"Is that you? What do you want with Yinzhu?\"\n\n\"I have business with him, of course. Ye Yinzhu, get out here.\" The voice sounded somewhat familiar, and Ye Yinzhu subconsciously walked out of the dormitory.\n\nA young woman in a black magic robe stood prettily before the dormitory door. The other work-study students who were already up saw her and instinctively made a detour. The visitor was none other than Yue Ming, a first-year student of the Dark Magic Department and the main representative for her department in the Freshman Tournament.\n\n\"Yue Ming?\" Ye Yinzhu looked with some surprise at the ill-tempered beauty from the Dark Magic Department. \"Is there something you need?\"\n\nYue Ming snorted coldly. \"Come with me.\" With that, she turned and walked toward the woods next to the mixed dormitory area.\n\n\"Yinzhu, don't go.\" Sula put down the bowl in his hands and stepped in front of Ye Yinzhu. \"Yue Ming, you lost the match, fair and square. Are you trying to get revenge in private? Be careful, or I'll report you to the Dean's Office.\"\n\nYue Ming let out a disdainful huff. \"Ye Yinzhu, aren't you supposed to be so tough? What? You need someone else to protect you now?\" She didn't deny that she was there for revenge, her icy eyes filled with provocation.\n\nYe Yinzhu frowned, gently pulling Sula aside. \"It's alright, I'll be right back.\" He then strode toward Yue Ming. Although he felt a sense of hostility from her, he noticed that her aura was very unstable, as if her heart were filled with anxiety and unease.\n\nSula said in a low voice, \"Be careful then. If she tries to ambush you, just shout. I'll be nearby.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled slightly and looked at Sula. \"Sula, from now on, I will protect you. I won't let anyone hurt you.\"\n\nSula froze. He hadn't expected Ye Yinzhu to say something like that at a time like this. \"You'll protect me?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu nodded very seriously. \"This is my promise. You are the second person to receive this promise.\"\n\nHearing this, Sula's expression couldn't help but change. *The second? Then who was the first? Hai Yang? Xiang Luan? An Ya? Or some other beauty?* Of course, he didn't know that the first one to receive this promise was the partner who had been with Ye Yinzhu for ten years.\n\nYe Yinzhu followed Yue Ming into the woods. It was already autumn, and as the autumn wind blew past, leaves fell from the sky, bringing a hint of chill and desolation.\n\nYue Ming walked all the way to the center of the forest before stopping. She spun around abruptly, her gaze filled with fury as she looked at Ye Yinzhu. \"Ye Yinzhu, what in the world did you do to Ming Xue?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu was taken aback. \"You mean your magical beast? I didn't do anything to her!\"\n\nTears welled in Yue Ming's eyes. \"You're lying. If you didn't do anything to her, then why has my Ming Xue been in a deep sleep ever since the match that day? No matter how I summon her, she won't wake up.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu frowned and said, \"I don't know about that either. During the match, when I was using my zither song to defend against her attack, I suddenly felt her emotions. She seemed very sad, as if she were struggling to break free from her contract with you. That's why I told you to be kinder to her in the future, to care for her more. A magical beast is your partner, not a tool.\"\n\nHearing Ye Yinzhu's words, Yue Ming paused, her emotions calming slightly. \"But Ming Xue has never slept like this before. She was a birthday present from my grandfather when I turned twelve. For over four years, I've spent every day with Ming Xue. Even though she can't speak, with her company, I never feel lonely, even when I'm constantly practicing dark magic. How could she possibly be sad? She doesn't have sapience, or even emotions.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu shook his head and said earnestly, \"No, you're wrong. On this continent, everything has emotions. Every living being has its own life. No matter how low their intelligence, emotions still exist. Never mind your Ming Xue; even my zithers, each one has a different temperament. And you can only feel their emotions when you truly immerse yourself and communicate with them with your heart. I heard from Director Nina that your Ming Xue is an Undead-type growth magical beast, capable of reaching the ninth level upon maturity. She will eventually become an intelligent-type magical beast, so how could she be oblivious to the outside world? It's just that you don't understand her deeply enough. The piece I played that day is called 'A Chinese Ghost Story'.² Perhaps it was this song that touched her heart, which is why I was able to sense her sorrow.\"\n\nListening to Ye Yinzhu, Yue Ming fell into deep thought. Suddenly, she gasped, crying out, \"Could it be that Ming Xue is sad because she was separated from her parents?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said, \"Separated from her parents?\"\n\nYue Ming's pale face flushed slightly. \"There are several ways to obtain a magical beast. Generally, defeating a magical beast and earning its recognition is the most direct method. But growth-type magical beasts are much more difficult. Before they reach the seventh level and evolve into an intelligent-type, their parents will protect them carefully. And after they reach the seventh level, it's too difficult to capture them. My grandfather went to great lengths to lure her parents away before bringing her back to sign a master-servant contract with me.\"\n\n\"How could you do that? How is that any different from being robbers and thieves?\" Ye Yinzhu glared at Yue Ming. \"Have you ever thought about it? If someone stole you away from your parents, how would you feel? How heartbroken would your parents be? No wonder Ming Xue was filled with sorrow. She was missing her parents who are far away! What she wanted to break free from was your contract. So this is how you acquire growth-type magical beasts—through such despicable means.\"\n\n\"You're scolding me?\" Yue Ming stared blankly at Ye Yinzhu. No one had ever scolded her in her entire life. For a moment, she was completely stunned.\n\n\"So what if I'm scolding you? Don't your despicable actions deserve to be scolded?\" To be honest, Ye Yinzhu wasn't very good at cursing people out. But when he thought of Ming Xue's sad expression, his heart filled with indignation.\n\n\"Then... then what should I do? I really love Ming Xue, I even think of her as a little sister. I can't live without her.\" The coldness in Yue Ming's eyes and the unique reclusiveness of a dark mage were now gone, replaced only by desperation.\n\n***\n¹ A *li* is a traditional Chinese unit of distance, roughly 500 meters.\n² The original title, 《倩女幽魂》 (*Qiàn Nǚ Yōu Hún*), translates literally to \"The Ethereal Soul of a Beautiful Maiden,\" which may explain its profound effect on the undead-type magical beast.",

Please cast your monthly tickets for *Sheng Xiao* first.\n\n—————————————————\n\nYe Yinzhu said coolly, \"I don't know what you should do either. If you truly like her, you should send her back to live happily with her parents, not restrict her freedom. I've said all I need to say. It's up to you now. I'm leaving.\" With that, he turned and walked toward the dormitory without a backward glance.\n\n\"Wait.\" Yue Ming hurried forward and grabbed Ye Yinzhu's sleeve. \"Can you... can you help me wake Ming Xue first? If... if she really wants to go back to her parents, then I'll let her go back.\" Saying this seemed to drain all her strength. Her eyes were filled with reluctance, but that sliver of resolve showed Ye Yinzhu the kindness in her heart.\n\nSeeing Yue Ming's anxious expression, Ye Yinzhu's heart softened a little. \"I really don't know how to wake Ming Xue. I heard your grandfather is the president of the Milan Magicians' Guild, isn't he? Does he not have a solution either?\"\n\nYue Ming nodded. \"Grandfather said he can't do it either. He also doesn't understand why Ming Xue fell into a deep sleep. Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to you. Grandfather said this happened during a fair match, so he won't help me and told me to come find you to resolve it myself.\"\n\nAlthough he had never met Yue Ming's grandfather, Ye Yinzhu felt a flicker of respect. However, the moment he remembered that Yue Ming's grandfather had separated Ming Xue's family just to make his granddaughter happy, that bit of goodwill vanished without a trace.\n\n\"How about this? Is there a way for you to let Ming Xue hear the sounds of the outside world?\"\n\n\"Yes. When I summon her, it's equivalent to opening a channel that connects to this world.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said, \"You open the channel, and I'll use my zither music to see if I can wake her. If it doesn't work, then there's nothing I can do either. But you must remember what you just said: you'll let Ming Xue go home.\"\n\nHe sat down cross-legged, took out the *Sea-Moon's Pure Splendor* from his spatial ring, and laid it across his knees, then nodded to Yue Ming. Although he wasn't confident, Ye Yinzhu had a vague feeling that his zither music seemed to have some special connection with Ming Xue.\n\nYue Ming traced a symbol in the air with her right hand. A yellow magical light flashed, and a dark blue six-pointed star materialized out of thin air. \"Appear, my partner, Ming Xue.\"\n\nThe cold magical fluctuation didn't bring Ming Xue before her. At that moment, Ye Yinzhu's eight fingers were already dancing gracefully across the strings, and the low, humming notes of the zither emerged quietly. As the music began, ethereal harmonics drew the listener into a scene of rippling turquoise waves and swirling mist. The soft, distant zither music, filled with a sense of profundity, drifted toward the dark blue six-pointed star under Ye Yinzhu's deliberate control.\n\nThis was the piece *Mist and Clouds over the Xiao and Xiang Rivers*. Among the eight great techniques of zither music, this piece belonged to the category of 'pleasing emotions and thoughts.' It used resonance generated by spiritual power to blend emotion with music and influence the opponent. The melody was profound and sorrowful, a deliberate choice by Ye Yinzhu, considering Ming Xue's nature as an undead-type magical beast.\n\nThe beautiful, heavenly music shifted through different tempos—free, slow, medium, fast, and free again—using light harmonics to create a myriad of sensations. Even Yue Ming, who was not the target of the music's influence, couldn't help but be moved listening to *Mist and Clouds over the Xiao and Xiang Rivers*. She thought to herself, *It seems I didn't lose to him in the match because of luck. The rich emotional power in his zither music seems even stronger than spiritual magic. And he's only at the 'Red Rank' right now!*\n\nYe Yinzhu was completely immersed in the music, his zither strings and heartstrings vibrating in unison. Yue Ming waited anxiously, but the dark blue six-pointed star remained motionless. Keeping such a channel open for a short time was not a problem, but it continuously drained her magical power. What would happen if Ming Xue didn't appear before her magic ran out...\n\nJust as the piece *Mist and Clouds over the Xiao and Xiang Rivers* ended, Yue Ming's magical power was depleted. The dark blue six-pointed star vanished amidst her frustration, but Ming Xue had still not appeared.\n\n\"It didn't work?\" Yue Ming looked at Ye Yinzhu, her eyes filled with disappointment.\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled slightly and shook his head. \"Don't worry. Although I couldn't wake Ming Xue, I know what's going on now. You should be happy for Ming Xue.\"\n\nYue Ming was taken aback. \"Happy? What happened to Ming Xue?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said, \"Perhaps stimulated by my piece, *A Chinese Ghost Story*, that day, Ming Xue, being a growth-type magical beast, has evolved ahead of schedule. But the sudden evolution meant her body hadn't fully formed yet. That's why she needs time to rest, to allow all her abilities to successfully evolve.\"\n\nYue Ming's heart stirred. She now remembered that at the end of their battle that day, Ming Xue's body had seemed to grow a little larger. Hearing Ye Yinzhu's explanation, she couldn't help but relax significantly. \"If that's really the case, that's wonderful. But can your zither music really make a magical beast evolve? According to my grandfather, Ming Xue should have needed at least another year to evolve to the fifth level!\"\n\nYe Yinzhu gave a wry smile. \"I don't know why it happened either. Maybe it was a coincidence. Well, I should be going now.\"\n\n\"Ye Yinzhu.\" Yue Ming called out to stop him, a troubled look in her eyes.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nYue Ming sighed. \"Please don't tell anyone about what happened today, okay? Especially the things you said to me. I promise you, after Ming Xue wakes up, I'll take her back to her parents during the academy's vacation this year. But my family can't know about this. Grandfather would never agree.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled—a smile from the heart. He nodded to Yue Ming and said, \"I won't tell anyone. Ming Xue will be overjoyed to know you're willing to let her go home.\"\n\nAs if mustering all her courage, Yue Ming said, \"Ye Yinzhu, when the time comes, can you go with me to return Ming Xue? I... I've never traveled the continent before, I...\" She was a little scared but was too embarrassed to say it directly. Ye Yinzhu's earlier words had stung her deeply. Although she practiced dark magic, she possessed the innocent heart of a young girl—pure and kind—which allowed her to understand Ming Xue's situation after Ye Yinzhu's wake-up call. From childhood, she had spent most of her time practicing magic, which was how she achieved her current skill, a point she shared with Ye Yinzhu. At this moment, she had come to see Ye Yinzhu, who had just lectured her, as a teacher-like figure.\n\n\"Alright. This is a good deed, so I'll definitely help you.\" Ye Yinzhu agreed without the slightest hesitation.\n\nWhen Ye Yinzhu returned to his dormitory, he found three guests waiting. Because the work-study students' dormitory was rather small, the three visitors were waiting outside the door. Sula, however, was gone.\n\n\"Yinzhu, where have you been?\" Nina seemed a bit impatient from the wait. Haiyang and Xiangluan stood behind her, their gazes all fixed on Ye Yinzhu.\n\n\"Grandma Nina, what brings you here? I was just chatting with a classmate. Is there something you need?\" Ye Yinzhu hurried forward, his gaze sweeping past the two girls behind Nina before landing on the department head.\n\nNina huffed. \"Pack your things and come with me. I've arranged a new dormitory for you.\"\n\n\"Ah? Grandma Nina, there's no need. I'm living here just fine.\" Ye Yinzhu wasn't just being polite; while the work-study dormitory wasn't large, he was very happy living with Sula. He was especially content with the care and warmth Sula provided him.\n\n***\nQidian Chinese Network welcomes all readers.

You're a student of the Divine Music Department, so in this academy, you listen to me.\"\n\nFaced with Nina's domineering attitude, Ye Yinzhu felt rather helpless. Xiang Luan was snickering behind Nina’s back, and while Hai Yang’s expression was icy, her gaze was soft and gentle.\n\nYe Yinzhu asked tentatively, \"Grandma Nina, who will I be rooming with over there?\"\n\nA flicker of amusement crossed Nina’s eyes. She scolded with a laugh, \"You little brat, why all the questions? You're the only green leaf in the entire Divine Music Department. Don't tell me you're hoping to live with the girls? Dream on.\"\n\n\"Er... you know that's not what I meant. I was just thinking, if I'll be living there alone, could I ask Sula to move over with me? We get along very well, and being the only male student there would be too lonely.\"\n\nNina said, slightly annoyed, \"Absolutely not. That kid is from the Assassin Department, isn't he? How can he live in our Divine Music Department's dorms? Hurry up and get your things. I don't have time to waste on you here.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu frowned and shook his head. \"In that case, never mind, Grandma Nina. I'm not moving.\"\n\n\"Hm?\" Nina's eyes narrowed. Xiang Luan, who knew her well, recognized this as a sign of impending anger. She quickly said, \"Ye Yinzhu, Director Nina has prepared a private villa for you, just like Hai Yang's. Why don't you hurry up, grab your things, move over, and thank Director Nina?\" As she spoke, she shot repeated meaningful glances at Ye Yinzhu.\n\nYe Yinzhu didn't catch Xiang Luan's meaning and just shook his head again. \"No. Sula is my good friend. I don't want to be separated from her.\"\n\nTo Xiang Luan and Hai Yang's surprise, Nina, who they expected to explode at any moment, suddenly softened. She said with a hint of resignation, \"Do as you wish. There's enough space over there anyway. However, I don't want to see any male students harassing the female students of my department. If that happens, you can get out, along with him.\" With that, she turned and left without a backward glance.\n\nXiang Luan covered her mouth and gasped softly, \"Heavens! Did the old matriarch have a change of heart?² When did she become so easygoing?\"\n\nHai Yang looked at Ye Yinzhu and said, \"Thank you for yesterday.\" Her voice was a little strained, but the heart-wrenching glimmer in her eyes caused an inexplicable pang in Ye Yinzhu's heart.\n\n\"Senior, if it weren't for you back then, I wouldn't have been able to formally enter the academy! We're all classmates; it's only right that we help each other.\" Feeling Hai Yang's somewhat unusual gaze, Ye Yinzhu seemed a bit shy.\n\nXiang Luan leaned in from the side with a giggle, her lovely face revealing a playful expression. \"Hai Yang came especially to thank you today. There are still nine treatments left, so we'll have to trouble you then. Alright, let's help you move.\" As she spoke, her eyes swept over the surroundings, a hint of disgust in them. \"This place of yours is too messy. The environment over at our Divine Music Department is much more comfortable.\"\n\nAt this moment, the gazes of many of the work-study students passing by were focused on the front of Ye Yinzhu's dorm. Xiang Luan's reputation as the number one beauty of the Divine Music Department was not for nothing. Even an innocent soul like Ye Yinzhu's heart would pound because of her, to say nothing of the average student. Every smile from Xiang Luan, every simple movement, was like a goddess descending to the mortal world to them, filled with endless appeal.\n\nYe Yinzhu looked around. \"I don't know where Sula went. Seniors, why don't you two head back first? We can move after Sula returns.\"\n\nJust as Xiang Luan was about to speak, a calm voice sounded out, \"I'm here.\" Sula slowly emerged from the shadows beside the dormitory. His eyes held a peculiar emotion that Ye Yinzhu and the others couldn't see. At that moment, the hand clutching a black dagger inside his sleeve was trembling slightly.\n\nWhen Ye Yinzhu had left with Yue Ming earlier, Sula had been following him. Sula had heard everything he said to Director Nina clearly.\n\n\"Sula, it's good you're here. Director Nina told us to change dorms, over in the Divine Music Department area. You'll have to walk a bit farther for your classes from now on. Is that okay?\"\n\nSula nodded lightly, his gaze meeting the clarity in Ye Yinzhu's eyes. \"Then let's pack our things.\"\n\nThe dorm Nina arranged for Ye Yinzhu was not far from Hai Yang's, also a small white villa. The bedroom was still just one room, but it was larger than all the rooms in the work-study dorm combined. The living room, kitchen, and bathroom were all incomparably better than before. What Ye Yinzhu liked most was the surrounding environment. This was on the edge of the Divine Music Department's dormitory area, embraced by tall trees. Not only was the air fresh, but it was also very quiet. The occasional sound of music drifting from nearby was enough to relax one's heart and mind.\n\nIn the following days, Ye Yinzhu and Sula's life gradually settled into a routine. Every morning after breakfast, Sula would go to the Assassin Department's training ground to practice, while Ye Yinzhu stayed in the dorm to practice his Zither Magic. Sula would rush back before noon to cook lunch. After their meal, they would go to the Floating Orchid Pavilion to work. Sula worked as a regular waiter, while Ye Yinzhu played music all afternoon until the Floating Orchid Pavilion closed at dusk, at which point they would return together. After dinner was time for cultivation, sitting opposite each other on their respective beds, ending the day's fatigue.\n\nBack at the Azure Sea, Ye Yinzhu had lived this kind of peaceful and orderly life every day; this was the lifestyle he liked best. He only discovered that since moving here, although Sula was as diligent as before, he spoke much less. Occasionally, he would sit alone in a daze, as if something was on his mind. When Ye Yinzhu asked him about it, he would always just shake his head without a word.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, six days had passed.\n\nIn the evening, when Ye Yinzhu and Sula returned from the Floating Orchid Pavilion, Xiang Luan and Hai Yang were already waiting for them at the door.\n\n\"Yinzhu, where have you two been? You're back so late,\" Xiang Luan said with some dissatisfaction, clearly having waited for some time. Though she was wearing a school uniform, it couldn't hide her radiance. Her charming pout, a mix of annoyance and delight, made Ye Yinzhu's heart beat a little faster.\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled. \"It's nothing, Sula and I just went for a walk.\" Sula had told him it was best not to let others know about their part-time jobs.\n\nOpening the door and letting the two girls into the villa, Xiang Luan said impatiently, \"The finals of the Freshman Tournament start tomorrow. How are your preparations coming along?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu was startled, only now remembering that the week-long break was over. He scratched his head and said, \"There isn't much to prepare, is there? Senior, who are our opponents?\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Xiao San**: The author's pen name, an abbreviation of Tang Jia San Shao.\n2.  **had a change of heart?**: The original phrase is \"轉姓了麼\" (zhuǎn xìng le me), which literally means \"Did she change her surname?\" It’s a colloquial way of saying someone has had a complete personality change, as if they've become a different person from a different family.\n\n<br>\nQidian Chinese Network - We welcome all readers.

Thank you.\n\n---\n\nXiang Luan shot him an irritated glare, the charm in her beautiful eyes making Yin Zhu stare blankly for a moment. \"What am I supposed to say to you? Our Divine Music Department's opponent tomorrow won't be as easy to deal with as the departments from the Magic Division. The four departments that made it to the finals are the Summoning Department and our Divine Music Department from the Magic Division, and the two traditionally strong departments from the Martial Skills Division: the Heavy Sword Warrior Department and the Heavy Cavalry Department. None of them are easy opponents. Actually, we were very lucky to make it out of the preliminaries this time. The Magic Division's three traditional powerhouse departments—Spirit, Space, and Summoning—weren't as balanced as in previous years. The Summoning Department surged ahead, entering the finals with a perfect winning record in the preliminaries. Meanwhile, the Spirit and Space Departments fought each other so hard that they both forfeited their matches against us and the Summoning Department, ending up tied for third place in the Magic Division with seven wins and two losses. We came in second with eight wins and one loss. Because of this, our first opponent in the finals is the top-ranked team from the Martial Skills Division's preliminaries, the Heavy Cavalry Department, who also qualified with a perfect record.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Ye Yin Zhu nodded, then looked at Su La beside him and rubbed his stomach. Knowing he was hungry, Su La smiled softly and immediately got up to go to the kitchen.\n\n\"'Oh' your head.\" Xiang Luan's temper wasn't nearly as gentle as her appearance suggested. She glared at Ye Yin Zhu and said, \"Aren't you worried at all?\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu looked taken aback. \"Worried? Why should I be worried?\"\n\nXiang Luan wore a cute expression of defeat. \"I really don't know what's going on in that head of yours. Right now, no one in the academy thinks we have a chance in the match against the Heavy Cavalry Department. Everyone thinks we're going to lose.\"\n\n\"So what? No one thought we had a chance before, either, did they?\" Ye Yin Zhu said with a smile.\n\nXiang Luan froze. That's right! No one had favored the Divine Music Department before, either, yet they had still made it to the finals of the Newcomer Grand Tournament. And this was the first time in history the Divine Music Department had even participated!\n\n\"So, you're very confident?\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu shook his head. \"No. But I'll do my best.\"\n\n\"You're driving me crazy.\" Xiang Luan was really a bit dissatisfied with Ye Yin Zhu's attitude. \"If you're not confident, why aren't you preparing properly? Director Nina told me to tell you that she's already very satisfied with us making it to the finals. She doesn't want to see any of you five get injured in tomorrow's semi-final. If you don't stand a chance against your opponents, as the captain, you must forfeit immediately.\"\n\n\"I have a way to make sure no one else gets hurt.\" A faint light flashed in the depths of Ye Yin Zhu's eyes. Xiang Luan didn't notice it, but Hai Yang saw the resolve and determination in his gaze.\n\n\"Praise Falan, this is truly like playing a lute for a cow.¹ I'm done talking. I'm going back to sleep.\" Xiang Luan stood up, gave Ye Yin Zhu a light kick on the shin, and walked off resentfully.\n\nYe Yin Zhu rubbed his leg with a wry smile and turned to Hai Yang, who was still seated there. \"Senior Hai Yang, what's wrong with Senior Xiang Luan? She seems angry.\"\n\nHai Yang said calmly, \"Senior Xiang Luan has always been very direct. She came to remind you out of good intentions and got a little upset when you seemed unconcerned. Don't worry, she won't stay truly angry. But, Ye Yin Zhu, do you know about our opponents for tomorrow?\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu shook his head.\n\nHai Yang said, \"Heavy cavalry is a pivotal military force in any nation on the Longqinus Continent. The famous Dragon Knights, for instance, are a type of heavy cavalry—the strongest among them. Their charging power is terrifying. With the knight's own strength combined with their mount, they won't give us a chance to cast magic in a close-quarters battle like in the proving ground. As far as I know, among the five students from the Heavy Cavalry Department we're facing tomorrow, two are Yellow-rank mid-tier, two are Yellow-rank high-tier, and one is a Green-rank initial-tier. The Magic Division has always won the Newcomer Grand Tournament, but this time it seems the Heavy Cavalry Department came prepared. Each of their five participants even has magic resistance gear. They are dead set on winning the championship.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu said, \"Senior, I have an idea for tomorrow. I hope you'll support me then, okay?\"\n\nHai Yang didn't ask what his idea was. She simply nodded and said, \"Alright.\"\n\nIt had been over ten days since the school year began. Although classes hadn't formally started, the Milan Magic and Martial Academy was livelier than ever today. The final stage of the Newcomer Grand Tournament had finally begun. For the students of Milan, the finals were a festival. The final stage of the competition was spread over three days. The first day was the semi-finals: the Divine Music Department versus the Heavy Cavalry Department in the morning, and the Summoning Department versus the Heavy Sword Warrior Department in the afternoon. The second day was a rest day, and the third day would feature the final match between the winners of the two semi-finals. All three matches would be held in the Central Proving Ground, which the Milan Magic and Martial Academy used for major student examinations.\n\nThe Milan Magic and Martial Academy's Central Proving Ground was located between the two main branches, the Martial Skills Division and the Magic Division, and adjacent to the mixed-zone dormitories. It was a full five times the size of a regular department's proving ground. On the east side of this massive circular arena was a grandstand that could seat three hundred people. Extending from both sides of the grandstand, high platforms rose ten levels high, circling around to meet on the other side. The place could accommodate the entire student body of the Milan Magic and Martial Academy, as magnificent as a giant colosseum.\n\nHolding a match with only ten people in such a huge arena was meant to give everyone ample room to display their skills. At this moment, the spectator stands surrounding the Central Proving Ground were already filled with students from both the Magic and Martial Skills Divisions, grouped by their respective departments, waiting in anticipation. The enthusiastic atmosphere was filled with waves of thunderous cheers.\n\n\"Heavy Cavalry! Heavy Cavalry! Heavy Cavalry!\" The students from the Martial Skills Division outnumbered those from the Magic Division two to one. Using their Battle Qi as a foundation, they roared wildly, completely overpowering the momentum from the Magic Division's side. After all, there was no way a mage's voice could be louder than a warrior's.\n\n\"Divine Music! Divine Music! Divine Music!\" Although few on the Magic Division's side had high hopes for the Divine Music Department, out of their pride as mages and their inherent noble confidence, they naturally cheered for their fellow mages. Unfortunately, their voices were completely drowned out by the Martial Skills Division.\n\nBefore the match had even officially begun, the students of the two divisions were already secretly competing. The teachers of each department were among their students and did not stop their cheering; competition was a necessary stimulus for student growth.\n\nYe Yin Zhu was currently on one side of the Central Proving Ground, along with the other four members of the Divine Music Department team. His long black hair was draped over his shoulders, and his mood seemed very stable as he quietly waited for the match to begin. Hai Yang stood beside him. \"Are you really going to do that?\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu nodded. \"Yes, I've already decided.\"\n\n\"Alright. Be careful.\"\n\nXue Ling and Lan Xi both looked calm, their eyes filled with a trace of admiration as they looked at Ye Yin Zhu before them. Only Kong Que had a look of pride mixed with dissatisfaction on her face.\n\nJust then, a voice from the grandstand captured everyone's attention.\n\n\"Students, please be quiet.\" The voice was deep but filled with an authority that could not be questioned. Every student and teacher present felt a distinct jolt in their minds, and the entire Central Proving Ground instantly fell silent.\n\nBathed in a faint purple light, Ferguson stood at the front of the grandstand. He wasn't using any sound-amplifying equipment; for a Purple-rank Grand Magus of the Spirit Department, a mental shock was the easiest of feats. Just six simple words had stunned the entire audience of over ten thousand students. This was the power of the Purple rank.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Playing a lute for a cow:** A Chinese idiom (對牛彈琴, duì niú tán qín) that means to address the wrong audience; to explain something profound to someone who cannot understand it.",

Also, don't forget to vote for and bookmark this book.\n\n***\n\nFerguson’s gaze swept across the entire arena, accepting the reverent stares of the students. The wrinkles on his aged face piled up as he smiled. \"The annual Freshman Tournament has reached the finals once again. I am very pleased to see so many outstanding young people among this year's new students. I don't wish to speak in platitudes. I only hope that the students who have joined our Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy family this year will learn from these elite students who have entered the finals. The effort you put in today is the capital you will use to stand tall on the Lonqinunus Continent in the future.\"\n\nThunderous applause erupted. The power of a Purple-ranked expert and his simple, clear speech gave the students, especially the new ones, a certain understanding of this elderly Academy Dean, the Chief Court Grand Magus of the Milan Empire.\n\nFerguson pressed his hands down, and the applause ceased. \"Next, students from the Divine Music Department will perform a piece called 'Nishang.' After the song concludes, the competing students from the Divine Music and Heavy Cavalry Departments will enter the arena on their own to begin the match. I will personally serve as the referee for this match.\"\n\nOne hundred tall, sturdy students from the Martial Skills Division quickly ran into the Central Training Ground from the side, setting down a series of tables and wooden stools. Immediately after, a beautiful sight appeared before all the teachers and students of the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy.\n\nA uniform of pink floor-length dresses. Those with long hair had it gathered in a ponytail. With light footsteps, lithe and graceful postures, and moving, beautiful faces, every figure was splendid and charming. Walking at the very front was none other than the number one beauty of the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy, Xiang Luan. Today, she looked exceptionally stunning. Her already exquisite face, lightly adorned, was like the Creator’s most perfect masterpiece. Almost no one could believe such perfection could exist in this world. Among the eighty-one female students of the Divine Music Department, any one of them could be described as beautiful, but at this moment, the other eighty were destined to be mere foils for her.\n\nHer star-like eyes held a faint smile. Her entire being, from head to toe, embodied the word \"perfect.\" A waist that could be spanned by a single hand, a shapely rear hidden beneath her dress that nonetheless traced a perfect curve, and those breathtakingly long legs—as she walked forward, all adjectives paled in comparison.\n\n\"Nishang\" began to play, but at that moment, the vast majority of people had not yet recovered from Xiang Luan's stunning appearance.\n\nEighty-one people, nearly twenty different kinds of instruments, sounded at once. There was no Divine Musician's melodic magic, only a moving melody.\n\nXiang Luan sat before a table, holding a pipa that looked as if it were carved from jade. She was the core of the entire piece; everyone else was merely her accompaniment. Her slender, jade-like fingers, akin to spring onions, lightly plucked the strings, and the tune of \"Nishang\" began to curl and drift. *She turned the pegs and plucked the strings a few times; before a melody was formed, feeling was already there.*¹ From her, one could completely understand why Divine Musicians were called the noblest of professions.\n\nThe moving melody continuously floated from her hands. Ye Yinzhu exclaimed in a low voice, \"After a hazy, idle dream takes form, a soft and winding melody enters its crescendo. I never expected that with Senior Xiang Luan's straightforward temper, her understanding of music could be so profound.\"\n\nHaiyang said, \"Sister Xiang Luan is the number one student in our Divine Music Department. Others only know her as the number one beauty, but how would they know that she is a genius among Divine Musicians? As a third-year student, she has already reached the high-tier of the Yellow rank. In the Divine Music Department, even few of the teachers can compare to her.\"\n\n*The thick strings clattered like a sudden downpour, the thin strings murmured like a private whisper. Clattering and murmuring, plucked together, like large and small pearls falling onto a jade plate.*² The gathering of ten thousand people fell silent because of this \"Nishang\" and its \"master.\" The dreamlike feeling made everyone feel as if it were unreal.\n\n\"Nishang\" ended in an ethereal mist. When Xiang Luan, holding her pipa, bowed towards the main platform, a thunderous roar of applause shook the entire Milan Magic Academy. The Divine Music Department had never before performed in front of students from other departments; they all held noble statuses. But this time, because the Divine Music Department had advanced in the Freshman Tournament, their unprecedented performance left an indelible memory on the students of the other departments. Some people even began to wonder: if the Divine Music Department could win today's match, what other kinds of performances would their cheerleading squad have in store? Invisibly, a single rendition of \"Nishang\" had caused the Divine Music Department's approval rating to soar.\n\nThe Divine Music Department cheerleading squad passed by Ye Yinzhu's group of five. Xiang Luan stopped in front of him and smiled. \"Was it good?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu subconsciously nodded. \"Senior's pipa playing is truly excellent.\"\n\nXiang Luan smiled, a little smugly, and said, \"Although I don't have much hope for you, if you can win today's match, I'll dance 'Nishang' just for you. My dancing is much better than my pipa, you know.\" With a laugh like tinkling silver bells, her fragrant figure gracefully departed under Ye Yinzhu's dumbfounded gaze.\n\nA faint fragrance lingered at the tip of his nose. A hint of a smile appeared in Ye Yinzhu's eyes, which now glinted with a firm, confident light. He began to walk towards the center of the training ground, all alone.\n\nWith Xiang Luan's departure, the Central Training Ground gradually grew quiet. The final stage of the annual Freshman Tournament was finally about to begin. Everyone's eyes were completely focused on the center of the vast training ground, watching the contestants from both sides gradually approach.\n\nBlack hair was draped over his back, forming a sharp contrast with the pure white of his Moon God's Guard robe. His eyes were as clear and bright as stars, his face handsome and elegant, and the corners of his mouth held a faint smile as he walked step by step toward the center, composed and confident. At this moment, Ye Yinzhu seemed to have entered a strange rhythm, merging with all his surroundings.\n\nHeavy, powerful footsteps, accompanied by five tall, black figures, approached Ye Yinzhu from the other direction. Compared to them, Ye Yinzhu's frame looked so small. All five men had blond hair and wore heavy black armor, resembling five moving fortresses. They appeared to be at least two meters tall, with extremely broad shoulders, and their resolute faces radiated a fierce aura. The standard Heavy Cavalry equipment—a five-meter heavy cavalry lance and a two-meter broadsword—hung from their waists and the bird-wing rings on their mounts, respectively. A tremendous momentum rushed forward; they were the true focus of the entire arena.\n\nYe Yinzhu had seen all five of their mounts before. The three in the center were all Marcino Iron Dragons. At nearly three meters tall and over five meters long, their massive bodies seemed to radiate an invisible ferocity. Paired with the knights' own two-meter height and immense figures, they looked just like the Dragon Knights Ye Yinzhu had seen in Milan City. Their imposing presence was even stronger. The other two knights' mounts were Eric Agile Dragons. Although their bodies were much smaller than the Marcino Iron Dragons, they were also much nimbler.\n\nThe standard five-man Dragon Knight configuration sent the students from the Martial Skills Division into a near-frenzy of cheering. In any country, Dragon Knights were the absolute number one military unit. Although Marcino Iron Dragons and Eric Agile Dragons were two of the more numerous types of tamed dragons, their value was still over ten thousand gold coins each. Their appearance on the academy's competition field, by its sheer invisible pressure alone, had already far overwhelmed the Divine Music Department, from which only Ye Yinzhu had emerged.\n\nOn the main platform, Nina's expression changed slightly. With a cold snort, she said faintly, \"The Heavy Cavalry Department has really brought out everything from the bottom of their trunk. They might as well have given these students a few real dragons.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.

    "content": "Happy Valentine's Day, everyone. Here is today's third chapter. Hehe.\n\n  ——————————————————————————\n\n  The department head of the Heavy Cavalry Department was a stout man of about forty. He remained silent in the face of Nina's taunt, his stern face showing not the slightest change as his eyes remained fixed on the competition field.\n\n  Ferguson smiled faintly and whispered to Nina beside him, \"For your Divine Music Department to have made it to the finals has already stunned many people, Headmistress Nina. You shouldn't be too greedy!\"\n\n  In a contest between those of the same rank, a warrior could never be a match for a mage, because any mage who could step onto a battlefield invariably possessed their own magical beast. Acting as a meat shield, the magical beast could completely hold off a warrior of the same rank. As long as the mage could truly unleash the power of their magic, the warrior's fate was destined to be a tragic one. The only exception to this among warriors was the Heavy Cavalry, for they too had their own mounts. If their mounts were powerful enough to contend with a mage's magical beast, then they would have a chance at victory. It was difficult for mages of the Divine Music Department to possess powerful magical beasts, whereas the five members representing the Heavy Cavalry Department this time were a full Dragon Rider composition. With the speed of the Erik Swift Dragons and the formidable offensive and defensive capabilities of the Maginot Iron Dragons, Ferguson had every reason to believe that if the Divine Music Department competed in a team battle as they had in previous matches, the power of their music would not even have a chance to take effect before they were trampled by the Dragon Riders. The Moon God's Guardian could not possibly block the charge of Dragon Riders, and although Ye Yinzhu had his Sound Blades, the heavy cavalrymen also had their own battle aura. In every aspect, the Heavy Cavalry already held an absolute advantage. The only thing that gave Ferguson a sliver of suspense was probably the person Ye Yinzhu himself. Regardless of the outcome, he hoped to see another surprise from Yinzhu.\n\n  The two competing sides were now facing each other in the center of the field. The captain of the Heavy Cavalry Department, seated atop his Maginot Iron Dragon, stood nearly five meters tall including his own height. Before them, Ye Yinzhu appeared so tiny.\n\n  \"Heavy Cavalry Department, captain, Nesta, second year.\" He dismounted the lance from the bird-wing clasp on his helmet and tapped it lightly against the helm in his left hand, performing a standard knight's salute.\n\n  \"Ye Yinzhu, Divine Music Department captain, first year.\" Ye Yinzhu placed his right hand over his chest, returning the gesture with a standard noble's etiquette.\n\n  Nesta's build was the most magnificent of the five from the Heavy Cavalry Department. His frame was exceptionally broad, and his stern face was devoid of expression. Faced with Ye Yinzhu's \"tininess,\" he showed no trace of underestimation. \"Please choose the competition format.\"\n\n  \"Wolf Pack.\" Ye Yinzhu's reply was just two simple words.\n\n  A hint of surprise finally appeared in Nesta's eyes. \"Wolf Pack?\"\n\n  Ye Yinzhu nodded.\n\n  Wolf Pack was one of the three competition formats. Unlike one-on-one duels or a team battle, the Wolf Pack format had each side send out one contestant to fight. The winner could continue fighting until they lost, at which point the second person would go up, and so on. Thus, it was not a best-of-five, but a format where one side had to defeat all the contestants of the other side to claim final victory.\n\n  Upon confirming Ye Yinzhu's choice, the entire arena was in an uproar. In everyone's eyes, it was already dangerous for the Divine Music Department to even choose a team battle. Perhaps there was still a slim chance there, but he had actually chosen the Wolf Pack format. This meant that every fragile Divine Music student could potentially be exposed to the ferocious charge of a Dragon Rider. The last shred of suspense in the match seemed to have vanished.\n\n  Only Ferguson, on the VIP stage, showed a faint smile of approval, nodding slowly. \"A good choice. He's avoiding the Heavy Cavalry's greatest strengths: a collective charge and their coordination. Perhaps Ye Yinzhu will truly bring us a miracle.\" In truth, most students from other departments didn't know that the Heavy Cavalry Department was strongest in team battles.\n\n  \"Senior Hai Yang, are we really not going to help Yinzhu?\" Lan Xi asked anxiously in a low voice.\n\n  Hai Yang glanced at her. \"Do you think we'd be any help if we went up there?\"\n\n  Looking up at the massive figures of the Dragon Riders, Lan Xi's face couldn't help but turn deathly pale, and she gently shook her head. At this moment, Kong Que, who had been somewhat indignant earlier, had already lowered her head.\n\n  Before the match began, Ye Yinzhu had already decided on the Wolf Pack tactic, but he was the only one from the Divine Music Department who would be fighting. In other words, if the opponent defeated him, it would be equivalent to defeating the entire Divine Music Department. And if he wanted to win, he would have to defeat all five of his opponents one by one. Just as everyone thought, when a Divine Music mage faced the charge of a heavy cavalryman, even the simplest contact could cause a fatal injury. Ye Yinzhu had said he would protect his partners, which was why, after reaching the finals, he chose Wolf Pack. This was not only a show of responsibility to everyone, but also a display of his own immense confidence.\n\n  The five competing students from the Heavy Cavalry Department slowly retreated to the edge of the field. Ye Yinzhu, however, did not retreat to his own side of the field to begin playing as others expected. With a wave of his left hand, the Sea Moon Clear Brilliance Zither appeared out of thin air, held in the crook of his left arm.\n\n  The match began. The first to come out for the Heavy Cavalry Department was a student mounted on an Erik Swift Dragon. A faint yellow battle aura shimmered at the tip of his lance. Amidst the cheers of the students from the Martial Arts Division, he charged towards Ye Yinzhu.\n\n  This was the first time Ye Yinzhu had ever faced a Dragon Rider. Although the Erik Swift Dragon's build wasn't excessively large, when its long, slender legs began to move, the momentum of its charge was like a hurricane. It covered several hundred meters of ground in just the blink of an eye, reaching Ye Yinzhu with a violent gust of wind.\n\n  The sharp point of the lance glinted with a cold light. Propelled by the speed of the Erik Swift Dragon and the intensity of a mid-tier Yellow-rank battle aura, it would have completely pierced through even a thick wall.\n\n  Cradling the Sea Moon Clear Brilliance, Ye Yinzhu stood there without even making a move to dodge. Watching the Erik Swift Dragon grow larger and larger before his eyes, his expression did not change in the slightest. Many students from the Martial Arts Division were already grumbling to themselves, wondering if this Divine Music Department captain had been scared silly.\n\n  \"Hum—\" Ye Yinzhu finally moved. Just as the Erik Swift Dragon charged within ten meters of him, his right hand swept swiftly across the zither strings. Ye Yinzhu's signature Sonic Burst instantly rang out.\n\n  The closer the distance, the greater the power of a Sonic Burst. Ye Yinzhu chose to release it at this moment precisely to deliver a full-impact blow to his opponent.\n\n  Heavy cavalrymen were far, far superior to mages in terms of physical defense, but their mental defenses were more fragile than any mage's. The sudden Sonic Burst could cause even a Yellow-rank mage to be momentarily dazed, let alone this first-year heavy cavalry student. His previously ferocious charge faltered, his mind going completely blank.\n\n  For an Erik Swift Dragon that had already built up speed, a distance of ten meters was crossed in an instant. As Ye Yinzhu's right hand swept across the Sea Moon Clear Brilliance, his entire body had already leaped from the ground. A yellow light flared up all over him. In mid-air, Ye Yinzhu's posture was as elegant as ever. As if he were a cloud, he enveloped his opponent before him.\n\n  <a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\">Qidian.com</a> welcomes all readers.

    "content": "For my friends who enjoyed this, please add it to your collection and vote to support me.¹ Thank you.\n\n  —————————————————\n\n  Without any excessive or complicated movements, Ye Yinzhu, who had jumped vertically three meters into the air, simply raised his right knee. His body was positioned perfectly to let the lance pass by, while the knight, his mind still blank, had yet to come to his senses.\n\n  Boom— The knight's heavily armored chest slammed into Ye Yinzhu's right knee. The Eric Minlong's speed had become a part of Ye Yinzhu's attack. The massive, two-meter-tall body, clad in heavy armor, was sent flying, knocked more than ten meters away by the instantaneous impact.\n\n  A huge dent appeared on his chest plate, and his helmet flew off the moment his body crashed to the ground. Blood spurted from his mouth. The dragoon, so menacing just a moment before, had now lost consciousness.\n\n  Having lost its rider, the Eric Minlong shot past from under Ye Yinzhu. From the tremendous impact, Ye Yinzhu's body had only drifted back a few meters before he made a graceful turn in the air and landed silently.\n\n  In the Central Proving Grounds, where tens of thousands were gathered, it was now so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Everyone stared, wide-eyed in shock, unable to believe what they had just witnessed.\n\n  From start to finish, Ye Yinzhu had only made a few simple movements, yet they were enough to knock a dragoon riding an Eric Minlong unconscious. A magician, defeating a dragoon in an instant with sheer physical strength—this alone was enough to leave everyone dumbfounded. Most people had already overlooked the explosive sound that had come from Ye Yinzhu's zither string.\n\n  Ferguson's eyes lit up. Nina's eyes lit up. Among the cheerleaders of the Divine Music Department, every pair of bright eyes shone.\n\n  \"Go, Divine Music Department...! Victory to the Divine Music Department...!\"\n\n  The students of the Magic Division finally had a chance to vent their excitement. Frenzied shouts rang out continuously, and the entire arena erupted once more. This time, however, the focus of the cheers had shifted.\n\n  The wolf pack tactic allowed for no rest. Before the landslide- and tsunami-like cheers had even died down, the second student from the Heavy Cavalry Department had already charged out. This time, the opponent Ye Yinzhu faced had a Maginot Iron Dragon as a mount.\n\n  The Maginot Iron Dragon was much slower than the Eric Minlong, but once it got moving, it was a mobile fortress. By now, any disdain the Heavy Cavalry Department had for Ye Yinzhu had completely vanished. This student, who also possessed mid-tier Yellow-rank Dou Qi, urged his Maginot Iron Dragon to slowly advance on Ye Yinzhu.\n\n  This time, Ye Yinzhu did not wait; instead, he walked toward his opponent. His pace was unhurried, like an ordinary person taking a stroll. The Sea Moon's Pure Splendor Zither that had been cradled in his left arm was now stored away in his spatial ring. Just like that, he faced the dragoon who was armed to the teeth, completely empty-handed.\n\n  Closer, they drew closer to each other. The entire audience held its breath, waiting for another spectacular clash.\n\n  \"Aaargh!\" With a furious roar, the five-meter-long lance created a blur of yellow afterimages in the air as the Maginot Iron Dragon’s massive head simultaneously charged toward Ye Yinzhu's chest.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu's absolute speed wasn't very high—at least, it was much slower than Su La's—but he was considerably faster than the Maginot Iron Dragon before him, which was known for its defense. With an instantaneous sideways shift, Ye Yinzhu dodged the Maginot Iron Dragon's charge. Facing the blur of afterimages enveloping him, he made a simple, quick movement that seemed suicidal: he leaped up toward the sharp lance.\n\n  The same yellow Dou Qi condensed on his right fist. A sharp glint shone in Ye Yinzhu's eyes as his fist surged with power, punching straight into the blur of the lance.\n\n  The dragoon had only one sensation: it felt as if the dozens of thrusts he'd made were all completely locked onto by his opponent's aura. Although Ye Yinzhu's attack was just a straight punch, no matter what variation the dragoon tried with his lance, he couldn't escape the envelopment of that fist. The only thing he could do was to condense all his Dou Qi into his knight's lance and meet Ye Yinzhu's attack head-on.\n\n  A fist of flesh and blood against an incredibly sharp knight's lance. With the \"same\" Yellow-rank Dou Qi, the outcome seemed already decided.\n\n  Suddenly, just as fist and lance were about to collide, Ye Yinzhu's right hand changed. His fist opened into a palm, twisting strangely. In that instant, the hand that should have struck the lance's point instead seized its very tip.\n\n  Instead of being alarmed, the knight was overjoyed. He put all his strength into both arms and roared, \"Up!\" If he could just lift the star of the Divine Music Department into the air, the outcome of this battle would be certain.\n\n  A body was indeed lifted, but it wasn't Ye Yinzhu's. The moment he grabbed the lance, Ye Yinzhu's feet had already landed on the Maginot Iron Dragon's massive head. Exerting force at the same time as his opponent, he effortlessly lifted the heavy cavalryman—who, with his armor, weighed well over four hundred jin²—straight off the Maginot Iron Dragon's back.\n\n  At that moment, the elegance in Ye Yinzhu's eyes had completely vanished, replaced by a domineering presence. A faint purple light replaced the usual clarity in his pupils, and his black hair billowed behind him. Though he was much smaller than his opponent, in the eyes of the audience, he now seemed impossibly tall.\n\n  With its head suddenly pinned by an enemy's foot, the Maginot Iron Dragon let out a furious roar and tried to throw Ye Yinzhu off. Its massive body began to twist violently, completely enraged.\n\n  Raising the lance high with his right hand, Ye Yinzhu took a swift step forward, moving from the Maginot Iron Dragon's head onto its back. \"Quiet down,\" he said in a low voice, stomping his right foot hard on the dragon's back. The Maginot Iron Dragon, famous for its defensive prowess, let out a pained cry as its powerful limbs gave out, and it collapsed to the ground.\n\n  \"I surrender.\" The knight, who had intended to keep fighting, was currently enduring wave after wave of impact from Ye Yinzhu's Dou Qi. Seeing his Maginot Iron Dragon prove so fragile before Ye Yinzhu, he lost any will to continue and surrendered on the spot.\n\n  Holding the lance, Ye Yinzhu gently set the knight down on the ground. Standing atop the Maginot Iron Dragon's back, his usual elegance had returned. Even he found it strange; he didn't know why his strength had suddenly increased so much. Although his second-tier Yellow Bamboo Dou Qi was equivalent to the second-tier Green of the Rainbow Ranks, placing his Dou Qi far above his opponent's, what he had used to lift the knight and bring down the Maginot Iron Dragon was not Dou Qi, but pure physical strength. The moment he had grabbed the lance, he clearly felt a hot current surge from deep within his body. He had performed those actions without thinking, a wild power seemingly wanting to burst forth. Deep within his clear eyes, a trace of purple now lingered.\n\n  \"Director Nina, why don't you hand this student of yours from the Divine Music Department over to our Greatsword Warrior Department? I'm afraid such fine talent will go to waste if he stays with you,\" said a sleazy-looking, slightly hunched old man from behind Nina.\n\n  Nina snorted. \"In your dreams, you old monkey. Why don't you go and poach Nesta? His talent is that of a recognized warrior genius.\"\n\n  The Director of the Greatsword Warrior Department, the one called \"Old Monkey,\" chuckled slyly. \"As if that fellow Tie Bi would ever let him go. Still, today's match is truly strange. A student from your Magic Division defeating one from our Warrior Division with martial skills... it truly makes me sad!\"\n\n  \"Not martial skills. It was strength. Absolute strength,\" Tie Bi, the Director of the Heavy Cavalry Department who had been silent all this time, said coldly. Though his voice was icy, his gaze upon Ye Yinzhu was filled with a burning intensity, showing no sign of anger over his department's student having lost.\n***\n*<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\">Qidian Chinese Network</a> welcomes all readers to visit and read.

    "content": "Hehe, Zi is about to make her appearance. Time to vote and add to your collection.\n\n***\n\nThe competition continued. To everyone's surprise, the third contestant from the Heavy Knight Department to enter the field was none other than their captain, Nesta.\n\nHis right hand gripped a heavy knight's lance, angled toward the ground, as if he were holding a piece of straw. Unlike the previous two students, Nesta didn't immediately charge at Ye Yinzhu upon entering. Instead, he spurred his Maginot Iron Dragon to walk slowly toward him. As steady as a mountain—that was the presence Nesta projected. His gaze was calm, but beneath that calm burned an endless battle intent. Every one of his movements was deliberate, perfectly rounded and without a single flaw.\n\n\"Ye Yinzhu, your strength has earned my respect.\" The Maginot Iron Dragon halted thirty meters away from Ye Yinzhu as Nesta spoke coolly.\n\nYe Yinzhu gave a faint smile, the Sea Moon's Pure Brilliance Zither reappearing in his hands. He had a premonition that the battle about to begin would be the most difficult one he had faced since the start of the new student tournament. On the surface, Nesta didn't seem as dangerous as Roland with his green dragon, but Ye Yinzhu's intuition told him that the combat prowess of the heavy knight before him was the strongest he had seen among the students, and it placed the greatest pressure on him.\n\n\"Out of respect for a strong opponent, I don't wish for my companions to drain your stamina any further. Let us have a fair fight. If you defeat me, you defeat the Heavy Knight Department. Just as you fully represent the Divine Music Department, I now represent mine.\" The calmness in Nesta's eyes was gradually replaced by a scorching heat as he slowly raised the lance that had been pointing at the ground.\n\nYe Yinzhu looked at him, somewhat surprised. \"But wouldn't that put you at a great disadvantage?\"\n\nNesta gave a faint smile. \"If I needed others to wear you out before I could defeat you, such a victory would be meaningless to me. I seek the constant improvement of my strength, and that can only be achieved by challenging the strong. Come, let me witness your union of magic and martial arts.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu smiled. Placing his right hand over his chest, he performed a standard magician's salute to Nesta. This towering opponent had likewise earned his respect and admiration.\n\n\"Kill—!\" Nesta roared. With a pull of his left hand, the massive Maginot Iron Dragon reared up, its upper body rising completely vertical. As the dragon's enormous body came crashing down, the five-meter-long lance had already shot out like lightning toward Ye Yinzhu. His soaring battle intent and immense aura surged to their peak in an instant.\n\nA pale green battle aura burst forth from the lance. The Maginot Iron Dragon's forward momentum brought Nesta close to Ye Yinzhu in an instant, but when his lance thrust out, its tip was still about a zhang¹ away from him. Was it a miscalculation on his part? No, of course not.\n\nThe green battle aura condensed into a tangible, sharp edge that crossed the distance of a zhang in the blink of an eye, arriving before Ye Yinzhu's chest. Its suffocating sharpness left no one in doubt of its destructive power.\n\n\"An Aura Blade?\" From the main platform, a watching Ferguson couldn't help but say in surprise.\n\nThe head of the Heavy Knight Department, Tie Bi, said calmly, \"To form an Aura Blade with only Green-rank battle aura... Nesta is the first person I've ever seen do it. If nothing unexpected happens, he will become a Gold Star Dragon Knight General within ten years, and within twenty, he will become the youngest Purple Star Dragon Knight General in history. Perhaps his aptitude doesn't compare to those two brats from the Violet family, but his dedication to improving his strength is second to none.\"\n\nAn Aura Blade is an evolved form of battle aura. Generally, it's a skill that can only be used when one's battle aura has been cultivated to the Cyan rank or higher. A powerful warrior can use an Aura Blade to project their power outside their body and harm enemies within three zhang. The stronger the battle aura, the greater the range of the Aura Blade. This technique has extremely high requirements for battle aura, demanding massive compression. It is impossible to use without a solid foundation of power and perfect control. For Nesta to be able to use an Aura Blade with his initial-stage Green-rank battle aura was, in itself, an anomaly.\n\nWhile those on the main platform marveled, the battle in the arena could not stop. Seeing the lightning-fast Aura Blade already upon him, Ye Yinzhu didn't even have time to use Sonic Boom. Moon God's Protection sprang open at the first possible moment, and the milky-white light instantly met the pale green Aura Blade in mid-air.\n\nA ring of milky-white light appeared at the point of impact and instantly expanded. A piercing, grating sound set one's teeth on edge. The Aura Blade grew shorter and shorter under the force of Nesta's charge, while the physical lance itself drew ever closer to the Moon God's Protection.\n\nYe Yinzhu knew he could not retreat. Nesta was completely different from the previous two opponents. If he backed down, he would have no chance to counterattack. Nesta's subsequent, relentless assault would immediately destroy him. So, he did not retreat. Using the buffer provided by Moon God's Protection, he took a swift step forward with his left foot and shot his right fist straight out, aiming directly for the tip of the lance.\n\nWas Ye Yinzhu planning to use the same tactic as before? No, of course not. Using the same tactic twice in short succession was practically suicide. This time, he was truly meeting his opponent's battle aura head-on.\n\nYellow and green—the two colors of battle aura collided between fist and lance tip. In that instant, space itself seemed to freeze for a moment.\n\nYe Yinzhu's fist and Nesta's lance never actually made contact. What collided was their battle auras. Yellow and green, the two colors compressed against each other in the minuscule space between them, and the two lights actually began to distort under the pressure.\n\nYe Yinzhu stood on the ground, while Nesta was high above him. In terms of the combined weight of Nesta and his Maginot Iron Dragon alone, they held an absolute advantage. Ye Yinzhu's not-particularly-sturdy frame looked truly tiny before them. And yet, it was this tiny body that, with the power of a single punch, had forcefully stopped Nesta's charge. The massive Maginot Iron Dragon was now completely unable to take another step forward. Ye Yinzhu's legs were like nails driven into the ground; he hadn't retreated an inch.\n\nYellow Bamboo Second Rank was equivalent to a middle-stage Green-rank battle aura. In terms of battle aura level, Ye Yinzhu was indeed a notch above Nesta. However, the gap between them was not large. If he had relied on this slight advantage in battle aura alone, Ye Yinzhu absolutely could not have withstood the impact of Nesta charging on his Maginot Iron Dragon. What allowed him to do so was his strength—the physical power that erupted from his body.\n\nThe moment Nesta's lance thrust down, a voice seemed to echo in the depths of Ye Yinzhu's heart: *Do not retreat.* It was as if his pride was telling him he could not fall back. The warm current he had felt before surged once again. It was only when he had truly thrown the punch and blocked Nesta's charge that Ye Yinzhu realized with a shock just how terrifyingly strong he had become.\n\nBoom—\n\nThe battle auras that both had compressed into their attacks finally buckled under the immense pressure and exploded. Amidst the deafening blast, Nesta and his Maginot Iron Dragon were actually forced back ten consecutive steps before they could regain their footing.\n\nYe Yinzhu did not retreat; the stubborn conviction rising in his heart would not allow it. But the defensive energy released by his Moon God's Protection had already dissipated into specks of white light, and his face looked somewhat pale.\n\nThe entire arena was deathly silent. Everyone held their breath as they watched this earth-shattering final battle.\n\nA flash of purple energy once again flickered in the depths of his eyes. Ye Yinzhu then simply sat down right where he stood, placing the Sea Moon's Pure Brilliance Zither he held flat across his knees.\n\n***\n¹ A zhang is a traditional Chinese unit of length, roughly 3.3 meters or 11 feet.",

The frustration of the first exchange, however, caused his fighting spirit to soar once again. He glared at Ye Yinzhu and demanded, \"Are you looking down on me?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu shook his head. \"No. Don't forget, I am a Divine Music Master, not a warrior.\"\n\nAs Nesta faltered for a moment, Ye Yinzhu's hands were already on the zither strings. With a light pluck from his right hand and a press from his left, a humming sound instantly rang out.\n\nSonic Burst. Nesta’s movements slowed for an instant, but clarity quickly returned to his eyes as a milky-white brilliance shone faintly from within his chestplate.\n\nIt was a magical item imbued with a Blessing of Light, its purpose to steady a knight's mind. For powerful warriors, the greatest fear was not a direct confrontation, but mages—especially mental-type mages. No matter how strong a warrior was, their spiritual power could never compare to a mage's. Therefore, high-level warriors would all possess some equipment to defend against mental magic. Otherwise, if an opponent broke through their mental defenses, they would be unable to execute any martial skills and would be left to be slaughtered at will.\n\nUnder the effect of the Blessing of Light, Nesta’s stupor lasted only a moment. In the next, his lance thrust out once more. This time, it was not a beam of battle aura, but an overwhelming torrent of lance afterimages.\n\nNo one could tell how many thrusts Nesta made in that instant, only that a faint green light enveloped Ye Yinzhu’s body like a shroud, sealing off every possible escape route. And one must remember, Ye Yinzhu was still sitting on the ground; even if he wanted to dodge, it was utterly impossible!\n\nYe Yinzhu felt it most keenly. Though Nesta’s thrusts were numerous, the most terrifying thing was not the quantity, but the fact that every single thrust was imbued with the same immense Dou Qi. There was no distinction between feints and true attacks. His initial Green-rank Dou Qi was being utilized to its absolute fullest extent; any single strike was enough to be suffocating.\n\n\"Iron Arm, has that kid Nesta already learned your Thousand Shadow Strike?\"\n\n\"That was last year's news.\"\n\nAn unimaginable scene unfolded. A hazy cloud of yellowish-green light emerged from Ye Yinzhu’s body like a dense mist, meeting Nesta's lance assault head-on.\n\nThe sound of clashing energies brought countless surging Dou Qi explosions. For a time, sand flew and stones were kicked up across the training ground. Nesta’s tall frame remained seated atop the Maginot Iron Dragon, but the dragon clearly could not keep up with his speed now. It seemed Nesta’s own power was dragging his mount along, every thrust of his lance accompanied by a sharp shriek. But no matter how ferociously fast his lance moved, the moment it reached the yellowish-green screen of light before Ye Yinzhu, it would be instantly deflected, unable to advance a single step.\n\nAll the onlookers could see of Ye Yinzhu was his raised right hand. From beginning to end, he remained seated, the four fingers of his right hand moving in a slight, continuous rhythm, like a blooming flower constantly shifting through various hand positions. And that greenish-yellow screen of light, like smoke, drifted out from his palm. No matter how frenzied the Thousand Shadow Strike became, it was held at bay.\n\nMartial skills. Ye Yinzhu had only trained for one year at the Azure Sea. For a warrior, one year was nowhere near enough time to learn many techniques. Even the single-minded Ye Yinzhu couldn't transcend this norm by much. Thus, in one year, he had learned only three skills—three skills rigorously tempered by Bamboo Sect Master Ye Li. One defensive, two offensive. What he was using now was that one defensive skill, and its name was: Bamboo Defense.\n\nBamboo: tough and upright. What Bamboo Defense possessed was precisely the toughness of bamboo.\n\nWhat danced in Ye Yinzhu's hand was not smoke, but Jade Threads. Slender Jade Threads, under the control of his Bamboo Dou Qi, had transformed into a smoke-like radiance. No matter how many thrusts there were, wherever the Jade Threads went, the lance afterimages were diverted. Bamboo Defense was, in fact, the Bamboo Sect's strongest defense.\n\nYe Yinzhu’s expression had become much more solemn, his eyes revealing utter concentration. His left hand swept swiftly across the zither strings, and at once, a series of Sonic Bursts erupted. Crimson musical magic intermingled with his Dou Qi, the three colors of red, yellow, and green appearing somewhat jarring.\n\nUnder the effect of the Blessing of Light, the Sonic Bursts could not achieve their full potential, but their impact on Nesta was still immense. After all, a special martial skill like the Thousand Shadow Strike required mental focus; even a momentary lapse in concentration would greatly diminish its effect. The attacking lance afterimages immediately thinned, and the pressure on Ye Yinzhu gradually lessened.\n\n\"Kill—\" Nesta roared again. All the lance afterimages merged into one in mid-air. The Maginot Iron Dragon's massive body was forcibly wrenched off the ground by Nesta's full power. Man and dragon together, with the lance as their tip, charged toward Ye Yinzhu in an all-or-nothing gamble.\n\nIn truth, he had no choice. The Thousand Shadow Strike was undoubtedly a high-level martial skill, but it was helpless before the Bamboo Defense. The Sonic Bursts Ye Yinzhu played had a stacking effect, and Nesta knew clearly that if he couldn't interrupt Ye Yinzhu, his defeat was certain. With his rich combat experience, he immediately chose to stake everything on one blow, concentrating all his Dou Qi into a single point. As long as he broke through Ye Yinzhu's defense, the battle would be decided.\n\nBreaking through Bamboo Defense was not something any technique could accomplish; only absolute power that completely surpassed the user of Bamboo Defense could breach its defenses. Nesta’s choice was undoubtedly the correct one. However, Ye Yinzhu was not static. The moment Nesta leaped with his dragon, Bamboo Defense had already changed into Bamboo Assault, the second martial skill he knew.\n\nWhile Bamboo Defense inherited the toughness of bamboo, Bamboo Assault inherited its pride and upright stature.\n\nAn extraordinary scene appeared. Under the bright sunlight, pillars of greenish-yellow light shot into the sky like sturdy bamboo shoots sprouting after a spring rain. The slenderness of the Jade Threads seemed to vanish, leaving only the pride of Bamboo Assault. Bluish-green lights as thick as a man's arm rose like a sprouting bamboo forest, covering the battlefield between the two in the blink of an eye.\n\nYe Yinzhu did not yet know how to use beams of battle aura, but the power his Jade Threads unleashed at this moment was even more terrifying. In order to execute Bamboo Assault, his left hand could no longer be spared to play the zither; all of his Dou Qi was completely focused on this single attack.\n\nA tragic wail echoed from the center of the battle. A rain of blood splattered across the sky, and two figures were thrown flying out at the same time.\n\nAt the last moment, Ye Yinzhu recalled the Sea Moon's Pure Brilliance Zither into his ring, saving it from damage. He himself was sent tumbling five zhang¹ by the tremendous impact. Fortunately, his Moon God's Protection robe could not be stained by any filth, which saved him from being covered in grime. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth, and his face grew even paler, yet the purple gleam deep in his eyes seemed to become even sharper.\n\nNesta wasn't much better off. By virtue of his weight and his thick, heavy armor, he only flew back three zhang before hitting the ground. However, because of that same weight, he fell harder. His helmet had been sent flying, and the lance in his hand had snapped in two, the pieces thrown far away. Blood streamed from his mouth and nose. The thick armor on his body was damaged in many places and showed signs of being dented, and his resolute face looked somewhat grim.\n\nAt the center of where the two had fought, the Maginot Iron Dragon remained forever. Its body, which once possessed solid defenses, was now riddled with dozens of bloody holes, large and small. Blood gushed out violently. It was clear it wouldn't live, and the sound of its mournful cries grew weaker and weaker.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  *Zhang* is a traditional unit of length, roughly 3.3 meters or 11 feet.",

    "content": "Sigh, another sleepless night spent writing. I'm sleepy now, so I'll upload the chapter first and then go rest. Friends, please vote, add to your collections, and support Xiao San. Your support is my greatest motivation. Thank you.\n\n---\n\nJust like the Moon God's Guardian, Bisi was also unstained by any blood. Perhaps because it had just devoured a life, Bisi's jade-green color now appeared even more crystalline. Its attack power, comparable to a divine artifact, was fully displayed under the Bamboo Strike; otherwise, it wouldn't have inflicted such a massive wound on Nesta. With Ye Yinzhu's current Dou Qi, he wouldn't have been able to kill a high-defense magical beast like the Machino Iron Dragon in a single blow. Bisi's power was indispensable.\n\nGetting up from the ground, Ye Yinzhu staggered slightly before steadying himself. Looking at Nesta in the distance, he said with a wry smile, \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to kill your dragon. It's just that if I hadn't gone all out back then, I wouldn't have been able to block your attack at all.\"\n\nNesta also got up at this point. His body was indeed formidable. Wiping the blood from his mouth and nose, he said fiercely, \"It's nothing. In my eyes, there's no difference between a competition and a battlefield. An all-out confrontation is the only way it's interesting. That was exhilarating. It's been a long time since I've been injured.\"\n\n\"Concede. Your injuries should be worse than mine,\" Ye Yinzhu said. His favorable impression of this heavy knight was growing, and he didn't want to attack again. This was the first time he had used Bamboo Aegis and Bamboo Strike against an opponent, and their power was much greater than he had imagined.\n\nNesta shook his head. \"From a competitive standpoint, you killed my mount, so I should have already lost. However, as long as I still have the strength to fight, I won't give up. It seems the secret I originally planned to save for the finals must be revealed now. Come forth, my partner, Dija!\" With a great shout, he raised his left hand, and a red hexagram lit up in his palm. A golden light shot toward the sky, piercing the high heavens in the blink of an eye.\n\n\"A contract.\" Ye Yinzhu looked at his opponent with some surprise. He instantly realized, \"So you have another mount. No wonder I felt that your coordination with that Machino Iron Dragon wasn't very good.\"\n\nA warrior's mount can be replaced, unlike a mage's magical beast. However, a warrior also only has one opportunity for a mount contract in their lifetime. Only when a warrior truly finds a partner they deem worthy will they use this contract. Once the contract is complete, this magical beast will accompany them for life. Only such a contracted mount can be perfectly in sync with its master, producing the greatest power. Warriors cannot summon; they can only call their mounts through the contract. Generally speaking, a contracted mount will not stray far from its warrior.\n\nA low, deep dragon's cry echoed from the distant horizon. Amidst the rolling sound waves, a crimson cloud sped over from afar.\n\nNesta bowed toward the grandstand. \"Please open the protective barrier and let my mount in.\" When their match began, the defensive barrier of the Central Proving Ground had been activated under Ferguson's direction.\n\nFerguson looked at the sky in astonishment, subconsciously controlling his magical power and using his authority as the Dean to directly open the barrier. He was the most surprised one of all at this moment. As a Dragon Mage, he of course knew what was flying in from the sky. It was a Red Dragon, just like his own mount, Kesa! Although its aura was far inferior to Kesa's, the sensation it gave off was unmistakably that of a Red Dragon. As a true dragon, a Red Dragon's rank was slightly higher than a Green Dragon's. He couldn't help but sigh inwardly. The students nowadays are getting stronger and stronger; a second-year student like Nesta actually possesses a true dragon. One must know that all true dragons are growth-type magical beasts. Once fully grown, they possess power of the seventh rank or higher. The Red Dragon is a fire-attribute dragon known for its attack power; both its physical attacks and fire-based magic are extremely formidable.\n\n\"Tie Bi, after the match is over, I'll need an explanation from you.\"\n\n\"You'll have it.\"\n\nFor the first time, a gentle look appeared in Nesta's eyes. The crimson cloud in the sky drew closer and closer. By now, Ye Yinzhu could also see it clearly—it was a dragon over seven meters long. It was slightly larger than Luolan's Green Dragon, clearly having developed better. Feeling the scorching heat coming from the Red Dragon, he couldn't help but suck in a cold breath. He knew that the last time he had defeated a Green Dragon, it was partly because Luolan had already lost the ability to fight, and partly due to his own surprise attack. But the Red Dragon before him was even stronger than the last Green Dragon, and the formidable Nesta was still here. How was he supposed to face the coming battle? For the first time, Ye Yinzhu felt a trace of helplessness. Fighting a Dragon Knight, the enemy was, after all, not just one person!\n\nThe Red Dragon circled once in the air, then suddenly folded its wings and slowly landed beside Nesta. With a joyful cry, Nesta leaped up and sat on the Red Dragon's broad back. With a wave of his left hand, a brand new long spear materialized in his grasp. Although spatial rings required magical power to support them, some high-level rings could be used with just a sliver of mental energy.\n\nThe spear in Nesta's hand was even longer than Austin's dragon lance, a full eight meters, exceeding the length of the Red Dragon's body. The shaft was a dark red, with four blood grooves running along it. Under the sunlight, a dark red light flowed, as if blood were coursing through it.\n\n\"Ye Yinzhu, this is my true weapon and mount. The spear is named Blood Soul, and this is my partner, the fire-attribute, growth-type, fifth-level Red Dragon, Dija. In the coming battle, I will use my full strength. If you have a magical beast, it would be best to summon it now.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu slowly shook his head. \"I have no magical beast. Since you can still fight, let's begin. I'll present you with a piece, *Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank*.\" His gaze changed. The purple glint within his clear eyes gradually receded, and a faint, silver sheen slowly appeared in their depths. Without another word, his eight fingers were already on the Ocean Moon's Clear Brilliance, which had reappeared.\n\nAt Nesta's command, the Red Dragon Dija soared into the air, ascending a hundred meters in the blink of an eye. With the Blood Soul Lance in hand, its dark red light erupted in a dazzling brilliance, forming a sharp contrast with his pale green Dou Qi. The Red Dragon suddenly roared, spewing a torrent of fiery breath. This green-tinged flame merged as one with the dragon lance in Nesta's hand. The air burned, rippling like water, as they used their immense momentum to charge directly at Ye Yinzhu below.\n\nAn eight-meter Blood Soul Lance, a fifth-level Red Dragon, and a Green-rank warrior. Such a combination would have a fighting chance even against a Blue-rank warrior without a mount, let alone Ye Yinzhu, who was currently just a mage.\n\nThe scorching air current seemed to rip the sky apart. Nesta and his dragon, like a streak of red and green lightning, shot down from the sky toward Ye Yinzhu like a meteor chasing the moon. The true strength he spoke of was not just his dragon and spear, but also the attribute of his Dou Qi. In the previous fight, Nesta had only used pure Dou Qi to battle Ye Yinzhu, but now, he had released his Dou Qi's attribute—fire. Ye Yinzhu's Bamboo Dou Qi was of the wood attribute, known for its rapid, unending recovery fueled by life energy. Fire Dou Qi was the perfect counter to wood-attribute Dou Qi; the difference in rank between their Dou Qi had now vanished.\n\nYe Yinzhu sat there, unmoving. His hands stroked the zither strings with great emotion as deep red Zither Magic Power drifted around his body. At this very moment, he had even given up on using his own Dou Qi, which was equivalent to the middle tier of the Green rank.\n\n\"Quick, stop them,\" Nina said anxiously to Ferguson.\n\n\"No, wait a little longer.\" A faint purple magical power was already swirling around Ferguson's body; he was prepared to intervene and stop the match at any moment. But for some reason, looking at the still calm and elegant Ye Yinzhu, he had a persistent feeling that Yinzhu wouldn't lose so easily. And so, he held back, refraining from acting.\n\n<p>Qidian Chinese Network <www.cmfu.com> welcomes all readers. The newest, fastest, and hottest serialized works are all at Qidian Original!</p>",

Don't forget to vote and add this to your favorites! Hehe. Also, please don't rush me, I'm constantly working hard to write. To be honest, I've got four pain-relief patches on right now.\n\n  —————————————————————————\n\n  Nesta was getting closer and closer to Ye Yinzhu, and Ferguson's heart grew ever more tense. With his power, he could easily stop the match, but at this moment, he didn't know exactly when he should intervene.\n\n  \"Hurry, Dean! If anything should happen to Ye Yinzhu, I'll...\" Just as Nina was about to say something she'd regret, the situation in the arena changed again.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu, who had been sitting serenely, did not begin to play his zither. He suddenly raised his head, stood up, and faced the scorching heat descending from the air. His clear eyes, filled with longing, let out a cry that was not particularly loud.\n\n  \"Zi—.\"\n\n  The magical glow around Ye Yinzhu vanished. A milky-white halo burned like the Moon God's Protection. Deep within that milky-white halo, a mass of purple light ignited from between his eyebrows, instantly spreading throughout his body.\n\n  No magical hexagram appeared. A purple, illusory figure simply passed right through him.\n\n  The illusion became solid. Purple hair, purple eyes, a tall body, and a cold face. Like the most solid of walls, he stood protectively in front of Yinzhu.\n\n  He did not speak, for they had no need for words to communicate.\n\n  Zi raised his head, his tangible gaze meeting the diving red dragon, Dija. Without battle aura, without any glow, he simply threw his fists.\n\n  At that moment, Ye Yinzhu had already sat back down on the ground, as if he knew Zi could certainly block that flaming \"meteor.\" His eight fingers simultaneously graced the zither strings, and a low, humming melody rang out between them.\n\n  How great is the force of a giant dragon and a heavy knight in a full-power dive? A thousand jin would be an understatement; their weight alone surpassed that number. Not to mention the battle aura and the fire dragon's magic. All of it was concentrated in that single charge. And facing them were only Zi's two fists.\n\n  Boom—\n\n  In the instant of impact, red and green light scattered in all directions. The entire Central Proving Ground's powerful defensive barrier shuddered violently.\n\n  The massive dragon's body was actually thrown back. The red dragon's terrified roar and Nesta's muffled grunt sounded at the same time.\n\n  The eight-meter Bloodsoul Spear let out a string of soft, humming vibrations as it trembled violently. The red dragon was flying again, only this time, its speed was much slower than before.\n\n  Yes, with his two fists, Zi had blocked the full-force impact of Nesta and the red dragon. His legs were now sunk knee-deep into the ground. In a ten-meter radius around him, the ground was spiderwebbed with cracks, with only the spot where Ye Yinzhu sat remaining intact.\n\n  \"Foul! That's a foul! He's actually letting an outsider help in the match! From what I can see, that's a Blue-ranked warrior at least,\" the Head of the Greatsword Department, Old Monkey, exclaimed in shock.\n\n  Ferguson stared at the center of the proving ground, his face grave. He shook his head and said, \"No. Although he is a warrior, he is not human. I cannot sense a human aura from him. A Life-Bonded Summon... it's actually the legendary Ancient Life-Bonded Summon.\"\n\n  A look of shock appeared on Iron Arm's face as well. He certainly knew how powerful Nesta's charge was; even he would be absolutely unwilling to face such an impact head-on. \"Are you saying that's a magical beast? To be able to take human form, aside from the undead, only a Ninth-rank magical beast can do that. But his power doesn't seem to have reached the Ninth rank.\" If it were a Ninth-rank magical beast, even the combined charge of Nesta and the red dragon wouldn't have been able to sink Zi's legs into the ground.\n\n  Ferguson said grimly, \"He is definitely not undead. All of this has already exceeded the scope of my knowledge. I'm afraid only the Great Sages of the Seven Towers of Falan could explain what's going on.\"\n\n  The roar of the collision did not affect Ye Yinzhu's performance. At this very moment, his zither piece had unfolded. The melody of *Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank* was like wild geese arriving as guests, soaring in the ethereal expanse of the highest clouds, their calls harmonizing in formation, now hidden, now visible, as if coming and going. Circles of dark-red magical ripples spread out from Ye Yinzhu's body.\n\n  Hearing Yinzhu's zither music, the lines on Zi's face softened slightly. He easily pulled his legs out of the ground. His movements were natural; he was clearly uninjured by his opponent's earlier charge.\n\n  At this moment, the one whose heart was most horrified was none other than Nesta. To him, Zi's fists did not feel like human hands. The momentary impact was like crashing into a mountain forged from mithril. His arms were completely numb, and the powerful recoil had forced another mouthful of blood from him. The fire attribute in his battle aura had not only failed to harm his opponent in the slightest but had been reflected back. If the red dragon Dija hadn't absorbed most of the force, he probably would not be able to remain seated on the dragon's back.\n\n  Nesta could feel Dija trembling, not from injury, but from a tremor in its very aura. Among the red dragon clan, an adult could reach the level of an Eighth-rank. For a red dragon to tremble, it could only be in the presence of a magical beast of a higher tier. But dragons were a proud race; Nesta had never heard of any magical beast on the Ryunuss Continent that could elicit such a reaction from a red dragon.\n\n  Looking down at Zi, who stood beside Ye Yinzhu, Nesta's will to fight fell to an unprecedented low. He didn't even know if he should charge again. And just then, he heard *Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank*. The melody rose and fell, continuous and unbroken, beautiful and moving; its fundamental tone was tranquil, yet there was motion within the stillness. It was graceful, flowing, meaningful, and fresh. His tense mood began to ease considerably.\n\n  The dark-red halo of light now covered the entire proving ground. Ye Yinzhu looked at Zi before him, and he suddenly realized how calm his heart was. With Zi by his side, his longing was soothed. The joy in his heart allowed him to become completely immersed in *Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank*.\n\n  The dark-red magical energy began to change. Starting from the area around Ye Yinzhu's body, the color gradually began to fade. The dark red slowly disappeared, and in its place was a faint yellow. Though the color was pale, it was exceptionally distinct.\n\n  Everyone who saw this scene stared with wide eyes. It wasn't unheard of for a student to advance in rank during a match. However, according to the sequence of the Rainbow Ranks, the Red Rank should be followed by the Orange Rank. But the change happening to Ye Yinzhu before their eyes clearly violated this rule. Yellow, that was distinctly the pale yellow representing the initial Yellow Rank! If they knew that Ye Yinzhu's magical proficiency had already reached the initial Green Rank, one wonders if their eyeballs would pop out of their sockets.\n\n  The Pure Heart of a Child, which Ye Yinzhu had painstakingly cultivated for sixteen years, had finally sublimated at this moment. This was not the Yellow Rank the spectators believed it to be, but the symbol of the Zither Sect's second major stage: Sword's Gall, Zither's Heart. Through constant effort and enlightenment, with Zi by his side, Ye Yinzhu had finally completed the most important metamorphosis since he began cultivating Zither Magic.\n\n  \"The autumn sky is high and the air is crisp, the wind is still and the sands are calm, the clouds stretch for ten thousand miles, and calls echo across the horizon. Borrowing the lofty aspirations of the wild geese to express the heart of a free-spirited scholar. What a fine rendition of *Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank*.\" Nina's gaze became somewhat entranced. She felt as if the one playing in the center of the proving ground was not Ye Yinzhu, but his master, the man she had longed for for so, so long...",

Tomorrow night at 12:05 AM, the Featured Post Event¹ will be held as usual, and an extra chapter will be released at that time. There will be a total of four updates throughout tomorrow.\n\n---\n\nZi's eyes were closed, his resolute face filled with an expression of comfort. No one saw that, at this very moment, a layer of faint purple crystals had begun to grow on the palms of his hands. The pale yellow magical energy released from Ye Yinzhu's body was quietly seeping into his.\n\nWith an Equal Life Contract, once one party's strength undergoes a qualitative evolution, the benefits to the other party will also be enormous.\n\n\"Ah—\" A miserable scream suddenly came from the sky, introducing a slight flaw into the beautiful artistic conception of \"Wild Geese Descending on the Sandy Plain.\"\n\nNesta had also been completely immersed in the music of \"Wild Geese Descending on the Sandy Plain,\" but the sudden, intense feeling of weightlessness jolted him awake. To his horror, he discovered that he and his red dragon were plummeting, smashing toward the ground.\n\n\"Wild Geese Descending on the Sandy Plain,\" one of the nine great masterpieces of the Zither Sect. Effect: Flight Prohibition.\n\nUpon hearing this piece, any creature with the ability to fly, up to three tiers above the performer's rank, will inevitably fall from the sky. At Ye Yinzhu's current magic level, any flying creature below the initial stage of the Blue Rank would be constrained by this melody. But as one of the Zither Sect's nine great masterpieces, \"Wild Geese Descending on the Sandy Plain\" required his full, undivided attention to play. Only with Zi by his side could Ye Yinzhu unleash its maximum power without being affected during the competition.\n\n\"Zi, save them.\" \"Wild Geese Descending on the Sandy Plain\" had not stopped, but Ye Yinzhu suddenly lifted his head to look at Nesta, who was falling from the sky.\n\nZi, who had been listening to the zither music, frowned slightly, but his body still shot forward. His right foot stomped forcefully on the ground, creating a deep pit one meter in diameter, and he used the immense rebound force to launch himself into the air. In the blink of an eye, he was already beneath the falling red dragon. With his palms in a sky-lifting stance, just as the red dragon was about to hit, Zi let out a low roar. With a catch and a push, he instantly dissipated the massive downward momentum, converting it into a horizontal force, and flung Nesta and the red dragon Diga away.\n\nThe red dragon's enormous body skidded along the ground, coming to a stop just ten meters in front of Ye Yinzhu. By now, the heavy armor on Nesta was cracked in multiple places. If he hadn't been gripping the scales on the red dragon Diga's back with his right hand for dear life, he would have been thrown off long ago.\n\nThe melody of \"Wild Geese Descending on the Sandy Plain,\" with its three rises and three falls, quietly came to an end between Ye Yinzhu's eight fingers. He looked at Zi, who had returned to his side, with a gaze full of warmth, a knowing smile appearing on his handsome, elegant face.\n\nZi nodded at Ye Yinzhu. \"There are too many people here. I'm leaving first. I'll find you later.\"\n\nMilky-white and purple lights lit up on their respective bodies. Zi once again transformed into a silhouette of light and merged completely into Ye Yinzhu's body, disappearing from sight.\n\nLeaning on his Blood Soul Spear, Nesta gasped for breath. \"Ye Yinzhu, you win.\" At this moment, his gaze had become exceptionally cold. \"I just don't understand why you had to lie to me. Was it for the element of surprise?\"\n\n\"Lie to you? I didn't!\" Ye Yinzhu looked at him, somewhat surprised.\n\nNesta snorted coldly. \"Then when I asked you to summon your magical beast earlier, you said you didn't have one. Who was that just now? Only a ninth-grade intelligent magical beast or an undead-type magical beast can take human form.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu shook his head and said, \"I really didn't lie to you. Zi is not my magical beast. He's my friend, my partner.\"\n\n\"Diga is my partner too. What's the point of you saying that?\" Nesta roared. Ye Yinzhu's formidable strength had already earned his respect, but now, the perceived deception instantly changed his attitude toward him.\n\n\"No, he didn't lie to you. He's telling the truth.\" Enveloped in a faint purple light, Dean Ferguson had appeared beside the two at some unknown point.\n\nNesta looked at him, stunned. \"Why?\"\n\nFerguson said, \"Because the partner he speaks of is different from your understanding of one. Perhaps your red dragon is also your partner, but you are bound by a master-servant contract. Ye Yinzhu and his partner, however, share an equal contract. On this point alone, you have no right to blame him. The match proceeded without any dispute, and Ye Yinzhu did not violate any competition rules. You have lost the ability to fight. I now declare that in today's battle, the Divine Music Department is victorious.\"\n\nThe students from the Martial Arts Division who were watching all fell silent, while the Magic Division's side immediately erupted into thunderous applause. They knew that the championship of this year's Freshman Tournament would once again belong to the Magic Division. Although the other semifinal match had not yet begun, the freshmen from the Summoning Department this year were extremely powerful, far beyond what the Martial Arts Division's second-place qualifier, the Heavy Sword Warrior Department, could contend with.\n\nNesta's gaze shifted to Ye Yinzhu. He naturally had no doubts about Ferguson's words. He gave a bitter smile. \"I'm sorry. Maybe it's because I can't quite accept defeat that I was trying to find excuses for myself. You won this time. However, when I feel I have the ability to challenge you again, I will come find you anytime.\"\n\nNesta's frankness brought a smile to Ye Yinzhu's face. \"Alright, I'll be waiting. You're right. Only by constantly challenging the strong can one become stronger. I just proved that myself a moment ago.\"\n\nNesta looked into Ye Yinzhu's clear eyes and laughed heartily. \"Good! It seems we will not only be rivals but also friends. I, Nesta, will be your friend.\"\n\n\"Sounds good!\"\n\nJust then, Ferguson's expression suddenly turned neutral. \"Ye Yinzhu, come with me. I have some questions for you.\"\n\nThe first semifinal match was over. The Divine Music Department, the dark horse of the Freshman Tournament, advanced once again. Relying on the strength of Ye Yinzhu alone, they had powerfully charged into the finals under circumstances everyone had thought impossible. For a time, the title \"Divine Musician\" became the hottest topic at the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts. Ye Yinzhu also became the most talked-about person in the entire academy.\n\nYe Yinzhu followed Ferguson all the way to the Dean's Tower where he resided.\n\n\"Ye Yinzhu, tell me, why did your magical energy suddenly jump from the Red Rank to the Yellow Rank?\" Standing in the center of the room, Ferguson looked at the young man before him with a somewhat strange expression.\n\nYe Yinzhu paused for a moment, then shook his head. \"I can't say.\" Though he was simple, he knew that the secrets of the Zither Sect could absolutely not be revealed to outsiders.\n\nFerguson smiled. \"You kid, you're refreshingly honest. But, do you realize that what happened today has already brought you considerable trouble?\"\n\n\"Trouble? Why?\"\n\nFerguson said, \"Among all cultivators, no one's cultivation can defy the rules of the Rainbow Rank system. Those who exist beyond this rule will be labeled heretics. They must be reported to Falan's Seven Towers and be dealt with by them. Today, your magic rank suddenly leaped over all three tiers of the Orange Rank. Tell me, should I send you to Falan's Seven Towers or not?\"\n\n\"Falan's Seven Towers? No, I won't go. Grandpa said that's a very dangerous place.\" Ye Yinzhu immediately shook his head. He clearly remembered that whenever his two grandfathers spoke of Falan's Seven Towers, their expressions would turn grim. Although they had never explained to him what kind of place it was, he figured it couldn't be anything good.\n\nFerguson said, \"But, many people saw today's match. If you don't want to go to Falan's Seven Towers, you must have a good reason to explain this. How do you expect me to silence the masses?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu scratched his head. \"I... I don't know either.\"\n\n---\n¹A community event on Chinese web novel platforms where popular chapters/posts are given a special \"elite\" or \"featured\" status by moderators, often accompanied by author rewards or extra chapter releases.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\">Qidian Chinese Network</a> welcomes all readers.

    "content": "Tonight at 12:05 AM, the \"featured post\" selection will be held as usual, and I will release an extra chapter then. I'll be updating four chapters in total today. Friends who like the story, please add it to your collection and vote to support Xiao San.¹ Thank you.\n\n---\n\nTurning around, with his back to Ye Yinzhu, a cunning glint flashed in Ferguson's eyes. He said lightly, \"There is only one way now. You are a student of the academy, after all, and I don't want to see you dealt with as a heretic by the Seven Towers of Falan. You have only one path to take. And that is to become my disciple. This way, I can help you resolve this matter by claiming I once gifted you a magical item that concealed your true rank. What do you think?\"\n\n\"Ah? Become your disciple? But I already have a master. I'm afraid that won't work.\"\n\nFerguson said, \"Then I'm afraid I can't help you and can only send you to the Seven Towers of Falan. However, did your teacher stipulate that you could only have him as a master?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu shook his head. \"He didn't, but...\"\n\n\"If he didn't, then what are you hesitating for? I've spent my life researching Mental-type magic and have yet to take on a single disciple. Rest assured, what I teach you will absolutely not conflict with what your teacher has taught you. Divine Music Magicians are a branch of Mental-type magicians to begin with. If your teacher asks about it in the future, I can help you sort it out.\"\n\nAt this moment, Ye Yinzhu couldn't help but recall what Nina had said to him that day. He asked tentatively, \"Then, can I just call you 'Teacher' and not 'Master'?\"\n\nFerguson was amused by Ye Yinzhu's self-deceiving suggestion. \"Fine, we'll do it your way.\" He couldn't help but sigh inwardly. In Milan, who knows how many princes and nobles wanted to send their children to become his apprentice, and he had refused them all. Yet this boy actually had the nerve to negotiate terms.\n\n\"Teacher.\" Ye Yinzhu bowed respectfully and honestly to Ferguson. With his simple heart, he could sense Ferguson's goodwill towards him. The warmth that came with this goodwill felt completely non-threatening. Coupled with what Nina had once said, it made him stop hesitating.\n\n\"Good. From now on, you are my one and only disciple. If I'm not mistaken, the one you summoned with a contract today must be your magical beast partner. Do you know his origin?\"\n\n\"A magical beast? No, Zi is not a magical beast, he is my friend. My good friend,\" Ye Yinzhu hurriedly explained.\n\nFerguson's expression flickered. \"So, you're saying he's been in human form since you first met him? When was that, approximately?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu said, \"Ten years ago. I was six years old then. Zi appeared while I was practicing the zither, and after that, he came to listen to me play every day. He was my only friend before I came to Milan. We were never separated during those ten years.\"\n\nHearing his words, Ferguson's aged face couldn't help but furrow its brows deeply. The situation Ye Yinzhu described was beyond the scope of his knowledge. \"Then what's the deal with the Equal Contract between you two? I've read about this kind of equal summoning contract in ancient texts before. It seems to be a Life-Bound Contract. It's equivalent to binding your lives and souls together. Did you know that?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu nodded. \"I know! Zi is my good friend, but he couldn't come to the academy with me. Zi said that with this contract, we could see each other often, so we signed it.\"\n\nFerguson gave a wry smile. \"But, a contract like this will also prevent you from having your own magical beast. Besides, don't you want to know where your Zi learned about this contract?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu's answer was very simple. \"I trust Zi.\"\n\nLooking at Ye Yinzhu's firm and somewhat stubborn gaze, Ferguson fell silent. He was naturally very satisfied that his disciple possessed such character. But he always felt that Zi was not so simple. No Dou Qi, no magic, yet able to block the full-force charge of a Green-ranked Dragon Knight with sheer strength—he had never seen such power among humans. The Equal Life-Bound Contract, according to legend, was originally a contract between a husband and wife. Only when a couple's feelings became thicker than blood would they give up the right to have a magical beast and sign such a contract, just so they could see each other at any time. No, that Zi is definitely not human. He couldn't be wrong, given his own mental power. Although his appearance was no different from a human's, he didn't have a trace of a human's aura. If he was a magical beast, then what kind of magical beast could possess such formidable physical strength and also be able to transform into human form? Thinking of this, Ferguson couldn't help but feel a headache coming on.\n\n\"Alright. Yinzhu, you should go back first. Get some good rest and prepare for the final match. I need to think for a bit to decide how to teach you the knowledge of Mental magic. After you go back, don't forget what I just told you. If anyone asks, just tell them it was a magical item I gave you that has been concealing your true strength. I will take care of everything else for you.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, Teacher.\" Ye Yinzhu gratefully bid farewell to Ferguson. Just as he was about to leave, Ferguson called out to him again.\n\n\"Wait a moment. Yinzhu, there's something I need to tell you. After this Freshmen Grand Competition ends, the academy will organize a practical combat drill. It won't be in a competition format. It will be on a real battlefield. At that time, outstanding students will be selected from each department to participate. I hope you go as well. The tempering of war often allows a person to grow more quickly. The academy will notify you of the specific details when the time comes.\"\n\n\"Okay. I'll listen to you, Teacher.\" At the academy, one had to obey the academy's arrangements. This simple belief kept Ye Yinzhu from having too many questions. He didn't even wonder why a peaceful continent would have wars.\n\nWatching Ye Yinzhu's departing figure, Ferguson finally let a smile fill his face. He thought to himself, *Does this count as using both threats and inducements? Such a good disciple, I probably couldn't find a second one in all of Longqinus. A simple and unpretentious character, profound and pure mental power and Dou Qi, and the miracle he brought to the Divine Music Magician profession, along with the Equal Life-Bound Summoning Contract... all of it symbolized one word: genius. And a pure genius, with no impurities.* Ever since watching a few of Ye Yinzhu's matches, Ferguson had set his sights on him. As the competition continued, Ye Yinzhu brought him more and more surprises. Until today, when Ye Yinzhu's magical power suddenly rose to the Yellow rank, he no longer hesitated, using this golden opportunity to semi-forcefully take him on as a disciple. He had a faint feeling in his heart that in the near future, Ye Yinzhu would inevitably become a new star in the magical world of the Longqinus continent.\n\nYe Yinzhu had just left Ferguson's residence when he ran into Sula. Sula seemed to have been waiting there for him. Seeing him come out, she hurriedly went up to him and asked anxiously, \"Yinzhu, what did the dean want to see you about? Was it about your power jumping ranks? You were too careless, how could a problem like this happen? Don't you know, this could put you in great danger. How on earth do you cultivate?!\"\n\nYe Yinzhu was flustered by Sula's barrage of questions. \"Sula, slow down, don't worry. It's fine. Teacher just helped me figure out a solution.\" He then recounted everything from his conversation with Ferguson from beginning to end. In the academy, there were only two people Ye Yinzhu trusted most: one was Nina, and the other was Sula. Other than some secrets regarding the Zither Sect and the Bamboo Sect, he didn't think there was anything else he needed to hide.\n\n\"Thank goodness, thank goodness, you really scared me to death.\" Sula patted her chest. \"Who was that you summoned today? When I saw Nesta and his dragon charging at you from the sky, it terrified me. The dean didn't even stop him. It's a good thing you had a way to handle it.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Xiao San (小三):** Literally \"Little Three,\" a nickname for the author, Tang Jia San Shao (唐家三少).",

    "content": "A few minutes late, my apologies. The Featured Post Selection Assembly at 12:05 AM will be held as usual. Eight featured slots are for everyone. There will also be a new chapter update at 8 PM and 12 AM tonight, which I welcome everyone to read.\n\n  ———————————————————————————\n\n  Ye Yinzhu said, \"That's Zi, my friend. To be honest, I don't know how strong he is either. It's just that ever since we signed the Equality Contract, I've seemed to feel his power is greater than my own, which is why I summoned him at that moment.\"\n\n  The way Sula looked at Ye Yinzhu suddenly turned a little strange. \"Equality Contract? It's actually an Equality Lifebond Contract? Yinzhu, don't tell me you and that Zi came down from Brokeback Mountain.\"\n\n  \"Brokeback Mountain? What kind of place is that?\" Ye Yinzhu looked at Sula in surprise.\n\n  Sula said, annoyed, \"Forget it, I'm not telling you. Last time, you said I was the second person you promised to protect. Don't tell me the first one was Zi.\"\n\n  Ye Yinzhu nodded. \"That's right!\"\n\n  Sula's voice trembled slightly. \"Could it be that you… you really like him?\"\n\n  Ye Yinzhu said earnestly, \"Of course I like Zi very much. We've been together for ten years. When I was six, he was by my side, listening to me play the zither. We grew up together and left the Azure Sea to come here together. He's the only friend I have.\"\n\n  \"Really just a friend?\" Sula asked nervously.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu nodded. \"Why say 'just'? Of course we're friends.\"\n\n  Sula retorted in exasperation, \"If you're just friends, why would you sign a Lifebond Contract with him? Are you crazy?\"\n\n  Ye Yinzhu said, \"Is there something wrong with that? I wanted to be able to see him whenever I wanted, so I signed it. At worst, I just won't have a magical beast.\"\n\n  \"You… Ye Yinzhu, I've discovered something. Talking to you is truly like playing a zither for a cow.\" Sula's body began to tremble again, only this time it was with anger.\n\n  \"Playing a zither for a cow? I used to play for bamboo. Could playing for a cow be a new way to practice the zither? No, that's not right! You're from the Assassin Department, how would you know the training methods of our Divine Music Department? Hey, Sula, don't go, wait for me…\"\n\n  Sula was indeed fast. Just as Ye Yinzhu started to move, he had already vanished among the winding paths of the academy. Ye Yinzhu knew he was definitely heading back to the dormitory. The battle just now had consumed a lot of energy, so he decided not to chase after him and walked slowly towards the Divine Music Department's dormitory area by himself.\n\n  After entering the Magic Division's grounds, he hadn't walked far before he ran into a familiar face. It was the talented Wind Department magician who had challenged him on his first day at the academy and subsequently lost to him in the match, Luolan.\n\n  Luolan was holding a bag of something and eating from it, her eyes listless. Though not even ten days had passed since they last met, Luolan had gained a whole size. Her pretty face had already become somewhat round.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu saw her, and she naturally saw him too. \"It's you.\" Her voice instantly turned cold, as if she had been cultivating ice magic all along.\n\n  \"Oh, hello, Luolan.\" Ye Yinzhu watched her with some vigilance. After all, their relationship was not friendly.\n\n  \"Looks like you're quite pleased with yourself. I heard you even beat Nesta from the Heavy Cavalry Department.\" As Luolan spoke, she had already come to stand before Ye Yinzhu. Her eyes spat fire; the moment she saw him, the rage in her heart soared to its peak. From a young age, not only had she lived a life of luxury, but with her extraordinary magical talent, she had reached the Yellow Rank at only sixteen years of age, not to mention her green dragon. She had always considered herself the strongest of the younger generation, even stronger than her several older brothers. But it was that one battle with Ye Yinzhu that had completely shattered her confidence. To her, it was not a simple defeat. She had issued the challenge, and in the end, she was the one who lost. The feeling of humiliation alone was more than she could bear. For days, she had been unable to pull herself out of her misery. She wanted to get revenge on Ye Yinzhu, but it had been a fair match, and the last shred of reason and pride in her heart kept her from using her family's power. Perhaps she had turned her grief and indignation into appetite; only when she was eating could her heart find a moment's peace. Even though she knew she was starting to get fat, she just couldn't control her mouth. Now, seeing Ye Yinzhu, the anger and hatred in her heart almost made her lose control.\n\n  \"Luolan, you seem to have gotten fatter,\" Ye Yinzhu said. He didn't know what to say to her and just wanted to get back to his dorm immediately, but Luolan was blocking his path, so the words came out subconsciously.\n\n  \"Are you making fun of me? This is all your fault. If I end up a fat pig in the future, I'll blame you, pester you for the rest of my life, and annoy you to death.\" Luolan's eyes reddened as she blurted out the words without thinking.\n\n  \"Uh…\" Ye Yinzhu didn't know what to say. Suddenly, he remembered a story his mother had told him before he left the Azure Sea. \"Luolan, it's not good for a girl to be too fat.\"\n\n  \"It's none of your business.\" In truth, Luolan didn't know what to do with Ye Yinzhu either. She knew she couldn't beat him, but having run into him here, she didn't want to just let him go.\n\n  \"Let me tell you a story.\" As Ye Yinzhu spoke, he stealthily shifted his feet to the side. \"Once upon a time, there were two pigs, a male and a female. Every night, the male pig would stand watch for the female pig, afraid that their master would drag her off to be slaughtered while they were asleep. The days went by, and the female pig grew fatter and fatter, while the male pig grew thinner and thinner.\"\n\n  \"Are you calling me a female pig?\" Luolan erupted in fury.\n\n  \"No, no, let me finish.\" Ye Yinzhu continued, \"One day, the male pig suddenly overheard the master discussing with a butcher that they should slaughter the female pig, who was growing nicely, and sell her. The male pig was heartbroken. From that day on, his temperament changed completely. Whenever the master brought food, the male pig would always rush up and eat everything clean. Every day after eating, he would lie down and sleep, and he told the female pig that it was now her turn to stand watch, and if he found she wasn't on duty, he would ignore her forever.\"\n\n  Hearing this, the expression on Luolan's face softened a bit. She subconsciously asked, \"And then what happened?\" Due to the intense emotional fluctuation, she was somewhat distracted and didn't notice that Ye Yinzhu had already taken a step to the side.\n\n  \"Gradually, the days went by. The female pig felt that the male pig cared less and less about her. She was disappointed, but the male pig continued to live his life of ease as if nothing was wrong. Soon, a month had passed. The master came to the pigsty with the butcher. He found that the female pig, who had been fat and strong a month ago, didn't have much meat left, while the male pig had grown sleek and shiny. At that moment, the male pig ran around desperately, trying to get the master's attention, to show that he was a healthy pig. Finally, the butcher led the male pig away…\n\n  \"At the moment he was dragged out of the pigsty, the male pig smiled at the female pig and said, 'Don't eat so much from now on.' The female pig was heartbroken and desperately charged forward, but the sty gate had already been closed by the master…\n\n  \"Through the bars, the female pig looked at the male pig, whose eyes glistened with tears. That night, the female pig watched as the master's family happily ate pork. Heartbroken, she lay down in the spot where the male pig used to sleep and suddenly discovered a line of words on the wall: 'If love cannot be expressed in words, I am willing to prove it with my life!' Seeing these words, the female pig was utterly devastated. When humans heard this beautiful and tragic story, they were all moved. Later, to commemorate this love, it became popular for girls to start dieting…\"\n\n  Luolan still stood there, but she was completely stunned. Gradually, her dazed eyes began to redden, and two streams of tears silently slid down her face. \"That poor male pig! Diet, I must diet…\" The food in her hand slowly slipped and fell. She suddenly found that her appetite seemed to have vanished.\n\n  \"Huh? Where's Ye Yinzhu? Ye Yinzhu, you…\" When she abruptly turned around, she discovered that Ye Yinzhu's figure was just disappearing at the end of the road. From the looks of it, he seemed to be in quite a hurry.\n\nwww.cmfu.com >Qidian Chinese Network welcomes all readers. The latest, fastest, and hottest serialized works are all at Qidian Original",

Please vote and add to your collections to support me. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n*Pfft.* Roland burst into laughter through her tears. “Am I that scary, that he ran so fast? But, that story is so touching! Was he trying to tell me to lose weight? Or was he afraid I’d really latch onto him? Hmph, in his dreams.” As she said this, the smile on her face couldn't help but deepen, and the resentment she held for Ye Yin Zhu unknowingly faded away. For a girl her age, emotions were prone to change. As the hate departed, she suddenly realized that Ye Yin Zhu didn't seem so detestable after all.\n\nIn fact, when Mei Ying had told Ye Yin Zhu that story, she had told him at the end that if he ever met a girl he would give his life for, he should bring her home.\n\nAs most people had predicted, in the second semi-final match held that afternoon, the Summoning Department defeated the Heavy Sword Warrior Department without any suspense, advancing to the finals alongside the Divine Music Department. After that, there would be a day of rest before the final showdown the day after tomorrow.\n\nYe Yin Zhu was a bit frustrated right now, or rather, at a loss. When he returned to his dormitory, he found it had become livelier than ever before. All the beautiful girls from his year in the Divine Music Department were there. With Hai Yang and Xiang Luan as well, over a dozen girls were chattering away, waiting for him.\n\nThe moment they saw Ye Yin Zhu return, nearly all the girls swarmed him at once.\n\n“Wow, Yin Zhu, you were so handsome today! You took out that big gorilla. I never knew you were so strong. How about I be your girlfriend?” A girl whose name Ye Yin Zhu didn't even know excitedly tried to throw herself into his arms.\n\n“Hey, no way! Yin Zhu is our collective property, how can you have him all to yourself? Don’t forget, he’s the lone male among the flowers of our Divine Music Department. As the number one pretty boy of Divine Music, no one can monopolize him.”\n\n“Hmm, that makes sense. Then how about we each take him for a day?”\n\n“Yes, good idea.”\n\n“Uh… fellow students, what are you all doing?” Ye Yin Zhu finally found a chance to speak. By now, his face was flushed bright red. Being surrounded by a group of girls, though enveloped in a fragrant breeze, didn't feel particularly wonderful. He would much rather it be just him and Sula.\n\nXiang Luan and Hai Yang stood to the side, their delicate bodies trembling with laughter. For some reason, she found Ye Yin Zhu’s awkward expression incredibly cute.\n\n“Yin Zhu, play faint. Quick,” a soft voice whispered in Ye Yin Zhu's ear. Perhaps because he was under too much pressure, his reaction was extremely fast. He closed his eyes and fell straight to the ground, immediately causing a series of gasps.\n\nSula appeared from somewhere, catching Ye Yin Zhu in her arms. She frowned and said, “Stop shouting, all of you. Yin Zhu just fought a huge battle. Can’t you let him rest?”\n\nThe dormitory finally quieted down. At Sula’s strong suggestion, the beauties of the Divine Music Department left one by one.\n\nXiang Luan and Hai Yang were the last to leave. As they passed by Ye Yin Zhu, Xiang Luan bent down and whispered in his ear, “Your acting is terrible. I haven't forgotten my promise; I’ll be sure to fulfill it when I get the chance.” After speaking, a blush appeared on her stunning face, and she quickly pulled Hai Yang away.\n\nAs the door clicked shut, Ye Yin Zhu leaped up from Sula's embrace, gasping for air. He said with a wry smile, “Sula, I feel like being surrounded by them just now was more exhausting than my fight with Nesta. Good thing you reminded me, otherwise, who knows how long they would have stayed.”\n\nSula huffed twice and said, “Isn’t it your own fault for being so careless, attracting trouble everywhere you go?”¹\n\nLooking at the closed dormitory door, Ye Yin Zhu felt a tickle in his ear. The faint fragrance Xiang Luan had left behind made his heart race once more. A promise, what promise was she talking about? Was it to dance the “Rainbow Skirt” for him? A sense of anticipation quietly rose in his heart. He made a funny face at Sula and hurried back to his room to rest.\n\nTo be in the best possible condition for the final match, Ye Yin Zhu did not go to work at the Floating Orchid Pavilion the next day, having Sula ask for a day off for him. He stayed home alone to cultivate.\n\nSword’s Gall, Zither’s Heart. After sixteen years of cultivation, he had finally broken through to the realm of Sword’s Gall, Zither’s Heart. Imperceptibly, his entire mentality seemed to have matured. Even when he played the zither, the aura of his music had changed greatly. If his music before was gentle and slow, filled with innocence and harmony, then now his zither’s sound had become upright and peaceful, pure and mellow. Like aged wine, its aftertaste was deep and lingering.\n\nQin Shang had once told him that after he entered the realm of Sword’s Gall, Zither’s Heart, he would enter a period of rapid advancement in Zither Magic. The speed of his improvement would be even faster than when he cultivated the Heart of a Child, and this would continue until he hit the bottleneck of the Sword’s Gall, Zither’s Heart realm.\n\nThe Qin Sect’s cultivation of Zither Magic differed somewhat from the common Divine Music Master cultivation on the continent, with a significantly faster pace. A normal person cultivating Zither Magic from childhood would take about ten to fifteen years to complete the first stage of nine ranks. But after entering Sword’s Gall, Zither’s Heart, the cultivation speed would slow down considerably. It took Qin Shang a full fifty years to break through the bottleneck of Sword’s Gall, Zither’s Heart, and enter the realm of the Ziwei Zither Heart. Ye Yin Zhu's situation was different; he was the first person in the history of the Qin Sect to successfully cultivate the Heart of a Child. The Heart of a Child was the most difficult introductory cultivation method of the Qin Sect, with extremely high requirements in all aspects. However, the difficulty of cultivating the Heart of a Child also meant a much more solid foundation. Sixteen years of single-minded focus was almost unimaginable for a normal person. This was only possible because Ye Yin Zhu was gifted with natural intelligence and born with eight fingers, giving him an innate spiritual connection to the zither’s sound, allowing him to break through the bottleneck in sixteen years. Once the Heart of a Child cultivation was successful, Ye Yin Zhu's cultivation would be a smooth path until he reached the Ziwei Zither Heart. He could even clearly feel his Zither Magic Power increase slightly with every piece he played, something that was simply unimaginable before. The benefits of the Heart of a Child would gradually begin to show.\n\nPlaying the zither for a full day was perfectly normal for Ye Yin Zhu. By the time the finals began, he had entered his absolute peak state. Not even Ferguson knew that this new disciple of his had already reached the Green Rank of magic-martial fusion.\n\nThe Divine Music Department’s opponent in the final battle was the Summoning Department, which had also seen a large number of outstanding talents emerge this year.\n\nTen people from both sides came to the center of the training ground at the same time. On the Summoning Department’s side, walking in the middle was a youth of about seventeen or eighteen. He was handsome, with exceptionally sharp eyes, and lacked the aloof air common to other mages.\n\n“Hello, I am the Summoning Department captain, Ma Liang. First year.” The other party extended his right hand in a friendly manner.\n\nYe Yin Zhu reached out and shook his hand. Just then, he suddenly felt something being placed in his palm. When he looked at Ma Liang in surprise, Ma Liang was also looking at him with a meaningful gaze and nodded.\n\n“Divine Music Department captain, Ye Yin Zhu. First year.” Subconsciously, as he released their handshake, Ye Yin Zhu held the object Ma Liang had slipped into his hand between his fingers. It seemed to be a slip of paper.\n\nMa Liang smiled slightly and said, “We are all students of the Magic Division. Besides, we’ve discussed it, and none of us wish to fight with the beautiful ladies of your department. How about for today’s final, you and I represent our respective departments? One battle to decide the winner, what do you think?”\n\nYe Yin Zhu was stunned. With this choice, his side was clearly at a great advantage. Besides himself, only Hai Yang had any real combat capability in the Divine Music Department. On the other hand, judging by their steady gazes and previous results, the five students on the opposing team were at least Yellow Rank magic experts. The moment he saw Ma Liang, he sensed that this person posed no less of a threat to him than Nesta did.\n\n“Won't you be at too much of a disadvantage this way? How about we stick to the wolf pack format?” Ye Yin Zhu didn’t want to take advantage of his opponent.\n\nMa Liang shook his head. “No. You have confidence in yourself, and I have confidence in myself as well.” As he spoke, he suddenly took a step forward and said in a low voice that only he and Ye Yin Zhu could hear, “This is not just a contest for the freshman tournament, but also a contest between the Qin Sect and the Painting Sect.”\n\nYe Yin Zhu’s heart shuddered. The Painting Sect, one of the Eight Sects of the Eastern Dragon?\n\n***\n\n¹A Chinese idiom, 招花惹草 (zhāo huā rě cǎo), literally \"to attract flowers and provoke grass,\" meaning to flirt or womanize.",

At the same time, please don't forget to vote for Xiao San¹ and add this book to your collection. Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n\nYe Yin Zhu's heart shook. The Painting Sect, one of the Eastern Dragon Eight Sects?\n\nQin Shang hadn't told Ye Yin Zhu much about the Eastern Dragon Eight Sects, but he had once mentioned that they were divided into two main parts: magic and martial arts. The four sects representing magic were Zither, Go, Calligraphy, and Painting. The four representing martial arts were Plum, Orchid, Bamboo, and Chrysanthemum. The Zither Sect ranked first among the four magic sects, while the Painting Sect was ranked last. Although this ranking didn't represent an absolute comparison of the four sects' power, it did, to some extent, reflect their respective strengths within the Eastern Dragon Eight Sects.\n\nYe Yin Zhu didn't ask, because he knew now was not the time. No longer refusing, he nodded and said, \"Alright then.\"\n\nThe other students from both sides gradually withdrew. Amidst the cheers of encouragement from the magic department students, the final battle of this year's freshman tournament was finally about to begin.\n\nMa Liang wore the standard gray magic robe of the summoning department. He was a bit shorter than Ye Yin Zhu, with very wide sleeves. Although not exceptionally handsome, his appearance gave off a cheerful feeling, making it easy for others to take a liking to him.\n\nWhen Ye Yin Zhu took out his Sea Moon's Pure Brilliance, something new also appeared in Ma Liang's hand. On the surface, it appeared to be a magic staff—a very peculiar one. The staff was about two feet long and shone with a faint red light. At its tip was a white gemstone, shaped like a large teardrop with the point facing outward, measuring a full three inches in length. To an ordinary person, this was just a strange magic staff, but Ye Yin Zhu knew that this was the paintbrush of the Painting Sect.\n\nThe Zither, Go, Calligraphy, and Painting sects represented four types of magic. The Zither Sect belonged to the Divine Music branch of spirit magic. The Go Sect belonged to the Domain Sealing branch of spatial magic. The Calligraphy Sect was similar to the various elemental schools, being the only one of the four to cultivate comprehensive magic. And the Painting Sect, precisely, cultivated summoning magic.\n\nYe Yin Zhu had heard a simple introduction to the four sects from Qin Shang, but this was the first time he had truly faced one.\n\nMa Liang smiled faintly and said, \"Brother Ye, I watched your previous matches. However, it was during your fight with Nesta that I confirmed my judgment. I know you are very strong. Today, let's have a fair fight.\" Evolving in strength in a way that defied the Rainbow Ranks was the very symbol of the Eastern Dragon Eight Sects.\n\nAs he spoke, Ma Liang twirled the magic staff in his palm. His relaxed expression turned solemn in that instant. With a swift wave of his right hand, he seemed to chant some incantation as arcs of yellow light appeared at the tip of his staff, gradually sketching a pattern in the air.\n\nTo others, it looked as though Ma Liang was drawing the magic circle exclusive to the summoning department while coordinating with a verbal spell. But only Ye Yin Zhu knew that his moving lips were just a diversion. Except in very special circumstances, the four magic sects of the Eastern Dragon Eight Sects did not require incantations to assist their magic. At this moment, the paintbrush in Ma Liang's hand was his true weapon.\n\nMa Liang's movements were fast. The paintbrush-like staff moved through the air like flowing clouds and water. In just a few blinks of an eye, a wolf-shaped picture was complete. A strange scene occurred: all the lines of light he had drawn instantly expanded the moment he finished the final stroke, merging in the air. In the blink of an eye, the expanding light had fully coalesced.\n\n\"Awooo—\" Amidst the wolf's howl, a massive azure wolf over three meters long drilled out of the pattern and charged straight for Ye Yin Zhu.\n\nSitting on the main platform, Ferguson couldn't help but be surprised by this scene. \"What a strange summoning array. I don't think I've ever seen it before. The young people these days, each one is more surprising than the last.\" Summoning magic was the strangest and most unique type of magic. Aside from its ranks also being divided according to the Rainbow Ranks, it was different from other magic systems in every other way. Furthermore, summoners used a thousand and one bizarre methods to summon different magical beasts. This was also why Ma Liang wasn't afraid of his Painting Sect identity being discovered.\n\nThe three-meter-long azure wolf was a third-tier magical beast, a Wind Wolf, a common type of magical beast. Although Ma Liang appeared to be at the Yellow Rank, Ye Yin Zhu, who was familiar with the ranking system of the Eastern Dragon Eight Sects, knew that this Ma Liang was at least at the same level as himself—the initial stage of the Green Rank. He just didn't know what the second stage of the Painting Sect was called. At his current magic level, he could summon at least a fourth or fifth-tier magical beast. Once the number of beasts reached a certain point, it would be very difficult for him to handle. He hadn't forgotten how much trouble the dragons had given him in his previous two matches.\n\nAt this thought, Ye Yin Zhu's body shot out to meet the wolf. Cradling Sea Moon's Pure Brilliance in his left arm, he extended his right hand, and the Verdant Silk quietly shot out. Infused with yellow Dou Qi, it transformed into rings of verdant light in the air, coiling directly toward the Wind Wolf's head.\n\nThe Wind Wolf was fast. As it pounced toward Ye Yin Zhu, a series of wind blades shot rapidly from its mouth. Although they were only Orange-Rank wind blades, as a magical beast specializing in wind, the Wind Wolf's Orange-Rank wind blades were instantaneous. Unfortunately for it, today it had met Ye Yin Zhu.\n\nThe Bamboo Dou Qi, equivalent to the middle stage of the Green Rank, gave the Wind Wolf no chance. The moment the wind blades met the Verdant Silk, they were instantly shredded, reverting to their original form as a light breeze. The Verdant Silk accurately looped over the Wind Wolf's head. The next moment, Ye Yin Zhu had already flashed past the wolf, rushing toward Ma Liang.\n\nThe Wind Wolf's body froze in place. As Ye Yin Zhu passed by, its massive body dissolved into motes of light and disappeared.\n\nMagical beasts summoned by summoners are condensed from elemental energy; this is a unique characteristic of summoning magic. Once a beast dies, it reverts to its original elemental form and vanishes. Therefore, the two most important things for a summoner are the skilled use of various summoning arrays and powerful magical energy. Only with greater magical energy can one summon more and stronger magical beasts through elemental conversion.\n\nMa Liang hadn't expected Ye Yin Zhu to deal with his Wind Wolf so quickly. At this point, although his paintbrush was still moving rapidly, his second drawing—that is, his second spell—was not yet complete.\n\nAlthough Ye Yin Zhu's speed couldn't compare to Su La's, powered by Dou Qi equivalent to the Green Rank, he was far superior to a magician. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of Ma Liang. He raised his right hand, and the Verdant Silk transformed into a slender streak of verdant light, stabbing directly at the right hand Ma Liang used to hold the paintbrush.\n\nJust then, a strange smile suddenly appeared on Ma Liang's face. The Verdant Silk did indeed strike his wrist, but Ye Yin Zhu clearly felt his weapon hit empty air. The Ma Liang before him was gradually fading into an illusion and disappearing.\n\n\"Brother Ye, my apologies. I cast a Decoy Beast spell on myself earlier.\" Ma Liang's voice came from behind. When Ye Yin Zhu turned around, he found Ma Liang on the other side of the field, a full five hundred meters away from him. And his paintbrush was still flashing rapidly. The drawing for this second summoning spell was clearly far more complex than the previous one.\n\n***\nFootnotes:\n¹Xiao San: The author's nickname (Tang Jia San Shao).",

    "content": "To all my dear readers, please add this to your collections and vote to support Xiao San.¹ Thank you.\n\n———————————————————————-\n\nA duel between the Zither Sect and the Painting Sect? Ye Yinzhu suddenly remembered what Ma Liang had said before the match. Taking a deep breath, he stopped his pursuit and instead sat down where he was, facing Ma Liang. Since it was a duel between the Zither Sect and the Painting Sect, he shouldn't use the martial arts of the Bamboo Sect.\n\n*Sea Moon's Pure Radiance* lay across his legs. Ye Yinzhu's hands lightly plucked the zither strings, and a series of seven explosive notes rang out simultaneously. At a distance of five hundred meters, it was difficult for an ordinary Divine Music Master to transmit sound with maximum power across such an open field to their opponent's ears. But for Ye Yinzhu, who used Dou Qi to pluck the strings, this was not a problem at all.\n\nThe seven consecutive explosive notes boomed like seven claps of thunder in Ma Liang's ears. His expression changed abruptly, and the speed of his hands slowed. However, due to Ye Yinzhu's earlier misstep, his second painting was already complete.\n\nAmidst a furious roar, a massive body blocked Ye Yinzhu's view. Its powerful physique, formidable aura, thick scales, and the crystal-like horn on its head all told Ye Yinzhu what it was: a Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon. It was the same kind of beast as Austin's mount.\n\nThe Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon Ma Liang had summoned was clearly much smaller than Austin's; it wasn't a Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon King. Even so, this Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon possessed the power of a peak Level 5 magical beast. As soon as it appeared, its huge body charged madly towards Ye Yinzhu with surprising speed, showing no signs of clumsiness.\n\nIts blood-red eyes and near-frenzied aura fully displayed its tyrannical nature. The golden dragon's body glittered under the sunlight. At least on the surface, the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon looked even more ferocious than Nesta's red dragon.\n\nAfter summoning the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon, Ma Liang's face turned a little pale; summoning a peak Level 5 magical beast had consumed a great deal of his magical power. However, he had great confidence in the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon; it was not only a sturdy meat shield but also a powerful attacker. He believed that even if Ye Yinzhu summoned that purple-haired man from the other day, it would be impossible to destroy his Tyrant Dragon in a short time. Seizing the opportunity, he sat down, closed his eyes, and placed the magic paintbrush across his legs to begin meditating, recovering as much of his magical power as possible.\n\nEight fingers trembled in unison as a beautiful melody poured forth. The gentle rhythm and cheerful tune filled the air with a sense of uplifting joy. Amidst this gentle and pleasant piece, *Green Water*, crystalline yellow blades of light floated out from the strings of *Sea Moon's Pure Radiance*.\n\nThe Sound Blades didn't seem abrupt at all, as if they were a part of Ye Yinzhu's performance. Faint lights flickered as they rose into the air, their target being the rapidly approaching Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon.\n\nThe Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon's body was simply too large. Although it wasn't a Dragon King, its body was still over eight meters long. With such a massive frame, it was impossible for it to dodge. The series of Sound Blades, unleashed from the state of Sword-Gall, Zither-Heart,² accurately struck its sturdy armor. A surprising scene unfolded: the Sound Blades, as if corporeal, actually created a shower of sparks upon impact with the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon.\n\n\"ROAR—\" The Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon let out another roar, this time tinged with pain. On its thick scales, the Sound Blades left a series of marks. Although they couldn't break through its defense, the barrage of numerous Sound Blades immediately slowed its charge.\n\nAt this moment, Ye Yinzhu's heart was completely immersed in the zither strings. Everything flowed as smoothly as drifting clouds and flowing water. After entering the state of Sword-Gall, Zither-Heart, the problem that had long troubled him—the inability to perfectly integrate Sound Blades with his music—was effortlessly resolved. Every simple note was now accompanied by a destructive Sound Blade.\n\nSound Blades were different from Wind Blades. Wind Blades relied on speed and sharpness to inflict cutting wounds on an opponent. In contrast, a Sound Blade would vibrate intensely upon impact, using the high-frequency vibrations of the music to saw through the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon's thick scales like a saw blade. Its destructive power was simply incomparable to that of a Wind Blade.\n\nWith every step the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon took, at least ten Sound Blades would meet it head-on. Under Ye Yinzhu's precise control, all the blades were aimed at a single area on its chest. Under the constant assault, the cracks on its scales grew larger and larger. Some smaller scales began to be shattered and sent flying by the blades, and the pain it felt grew increasingly intense.\n\nThe Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon drew closer and closer to Ye Yinzhu, and the impact of the Sound Blades it received became more and more concentrated. The smooth and flowing tune of *Green Water* crescendoed as both hands swept across the strings, and fourteen Sound Blades simultaneously tore through the air, flying in a crisscross pattern towards the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon.\n\nJust then, the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon's blood-red eyes suddenly turned gold. A ball of golden elemental energy surged into its crystal-like horn. A brilliant golden beam, sparkling with specks of gold light, shot out and collided with the fourteen incoming Sound Blades. A metallic clang rang out as both the Sound Blades and the beam shattered simultaneously.\n\nMetal-element magic was an esoteric type of magic, a branch of elemental magic. Internally, it could enhance one's own defense; externally, it could unleash powerful attacks like clashing weapons. It was the innate magic of the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon.\n\nPerhaps because the Sound Blades were too painful, the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon halted its charge. Its crystal horn and the massive dragon tail raised behind it continuously fired off golden streams of metal-element magic to counter Ye Yinzhu.\n\nA faint smile appeared on Ye Yinzhu's face. If the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon had insisted on charging, Ye Yinzhu would have had to engage it in close combat to block its frenzied attack before the full power of *Green Water* could be unleashed. But now that the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon was countering him with magic, it no longer had any chance.\n\nAccording to the Rainbow Ranks, a peak Level 5 Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon was equivalent to an initial Cyan Rank human in terms of power, a full three sub-ranks higher than Ye Yinzhu. Therefore, Ye Yinzhu's Sound Blades couldn't completely block the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon's violent metallic bombardment. However, the firing speed of his Sound Blades was far greater than his opponent's. One after another, the blades whittled down the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon's metal magic to its weakest, and by the time it reached Ye Yinzhu, it would be unable to penetrate the defense of the Moon God's Guardian.\n\nJust then, Ma Liang suddenly opened his eyes, thinking to himself, *This is bad*. He had never seen the Zither Sect's Sound Blades; this ability of Ye Yinzhu's was a complete innovation. But he knew very well that the true strength of the Zither Sect lay in its zither music. With the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon no longer charging, he couldn't be sure how Ye Yinzhu's music would change the course of the match. A flicker of hesitation appeared in his eyes. Taking a deep breath, he raised his left hand. A crystal-clear vial appeared in his palm. The vial was transparent, and one could see it was more than half-full of a crimson liquid.\n\nThe Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon's attack speed grew slower and slower, while Ye Yinzhu also strangely reduced the frequency of his Sound Blade attacks. The frenzy in the Tyrant Dragon's eyes gradually calmed. When Ye Yinzhu played a string of beautiful notes using the \"Precious Goose Holding a Reed\" stance, it actually stopped attacking him completely.\n\nWith a slight smile, Ye Yinzhu said to the Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon, \"You're tired. Go rest on the side for a bit.\"\n\nThe Golden Crystal Tyrant Dragon, always known for its fiery temper, actually nodded its massive head, turned, and walked toward the edge of the battlefield. Its enormous body dissolved into specks of golden light and quietly faded away.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Xiao San* (小三, lit. \"Little Three\") is a common, humble nickname used by authors to refer to themselves.\n² *Sword-Gall, Zither-Heart* (劍膽琴心) is a Chinese idiom describing someone who is brave and resolute like a swordsman, yet sensitive and artistic like a zither player.

Thank you.\n\n---\n\nAlthough *Green Water* was not one of the Zither Sect’s nine great masterpieces, it possessed the effect of calming the mind and dispelling all negative emotions. With this single piece, once the melody was a third of the way through, Ye Yinzhu not only pacified the Golden Crystal Tyrannosaur's desire to attack but also severed the connection between it and its summoner, Ma Liang. Having lost the link to its master, the summoned beast, formed from elements, naturally ceased to exist.\n\nSeeing this, Ma Liang sighed from a distance. \"Ye Yinzhu, you are truly strong. I will have to use my greatest power to fight you.\" He gazed at Ye Yinzhu with deep meaning in his eyes. Both knew in their hearts that this duel was not merely a match in the freshman tournament; they were also representing their respective magical sects. Therefore, this was also an internal contest among the Eight Sects of the Eastern Dragon.\n\nThe mind-calming effect of *Green Water* had little impact on Ma Liang to begin with, not to mention Ye Yinzhu had focused the main melody on the Golden Crystal Tyrannosaur to defeat a peak fifth-level magical beast in such a short time. Thus, aside from the magic he had expended summoning the beast, Ma Liang was unharmed.\n\nPlacing both hands on the strings, the lingering notes of *Green Water* faded. Ye Yinzhu smiled faintly. \"Your guidance, please.\" The rising stars of the Zither Sect and the Painting Sect now sat facing each other from afar in the central training grounds of the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts. At this very moment, their true match began.\n\nMa Liang extended his left hand and drew a circle in front of him. A silver ring of an archaic design on his left middle finger instantly flared with a brilliant silver light. As he completed the circle, five objects suddenly appeared before him, floating in the air and emitting a faint silver glow. Each object was large, and as they hovered in front of Ma Liang, a strange sensation caused the air to grow thick. A massive amount of elemental energy surged madly toward the five objects.\n\nThe five items were a long silver horn, a string of enormous teeth from some unknown creature, a silver orb of light, a huge silver eyeball, and a large, diamond-shaped scale.\n\nOn the main dais, the department heads from the magic division seated in the front row stood up almost simultaneously, the head of the summoning department included. Their eyes were filled with shock. Ferguson, standing at the very front, sighed. \"I'm afraid Yinzhu is going to lose. The Five Artifacts of the Silver Dragon... they're actually the Five Artifacts of the Silver Dragon, comparable to divine artifacts. The auxiliary summoning magic items that every summoner dreams of.\"\n\n\"No, not the Five Artifacts, but the Six. Besides the Silver Dragon Horn, Teeth, Heart, Eye, and Scale, that bottle of red liquid in his hand is likely Silver Dragon Blood. How did this brat get his hands on such a treasure without me even knowing?\" The eyes of the summoning department head looked as if they were about to spew fire—the fire of pure desire. For a summoner, nothing was more alluring than these top-tier auxiliary summoning items.\n\nThe thickening air made Ye Yinzhu’s expression turn grave. Looking at the Five Artifacts of the Silver Dragon before Ma Liang and feeling the immense, oppressive force rushing toward him, he knew that these were magical items far beyond his ability to counter. The sheer power of their magical aura was no less than that of a Purple-ranked spell. He was even finding it difficult to play his zither now; under the immense pressure, even moving his body had become a struggle.\n\nMa Liang’s eyes shone with powerful confidence. \"Ye Yinzhu, surrender. Although it shames me to win with magical items, I do not want to lose. These five things before me are all organs from a silver dragon. Including the Silver Dragon Blood in my hand, they are known as the Six Artifacts of the Silver Dragon. Silver dragons are also called magic dragons. Among all dragon species, their physical combat ability is the weakest, but their magical power is the strongest, second only to the Sacred Dragons. They possess the strength of a peak ninth-level magical beast. With the Six Artifacts, I can use all my magical power to summon a silver dragon to launch a single attack. It is something you cannot possibly withstand. I don't want to hurt you, so...\"\n\n\"Continue,\" Ye Yinzhu suddenly interrupted him. \"Grandfather once taught me that on the battlefield, one must never retreat, no matter the enemy. Even the strongest foe has a weakness.\" His heart was calm, his eyes still clear, and his movements remained graceful. To be able to sit so steadily in the face of the immense pressure from the Six Artifacts of the Silver Dragon made even the teachers on the dais look at this student in a new light. Ferguson nodded repeatedly in satisfaction. However, he was already preparing to intervene and stop the match.\n\nMa Liang said helplessly, \"Must we really go on? If you can't block the silver dragon's attack, just say you yield. I think I can still manage to retract the spell.\" Retracting a cast spell caused extreme backlash for a mage, especially when using magic beyond one's level. Ma Liang did not want to hurt Ye Yinzhu, but he craved this victory just as much. In his eyes, this was a perfect opportunity for the Painting Sect to surpass the Zither Sect. Therefore, he would rather risk the magical backlash and fight to the very end.\n\nHe slowly raised his brush. When he opened the vial containing the Silver Dragon Blood, the magical elements in the air surged toward him in a frenzy. The Five Artifacts of the Silver Dragon before him all lit up with silver radiance, forming a halo that absorbed the incoming elemental power.\n\nDipping his brush lightly into the Silver Dragon Blood, Ma Liang quickly sealed the vial as if afraid of wasting a single drop. With a turn of his wrist, a blood-red image was already taking shape in his hand.\n\nThe faint silver light gradually intensified, and the silver halo began to expand. An intangible majesty and immense pressure solidified the air. The unique magical pressure of a silver dragon caused all the magical elements within the central training grounds to abandon Ye Yinzhu and converge at the center of the Six Artifacts. A major benefit of casting a spell with the Six Artifacts of the Silver Dragon was that within the range of the dragon's aura, no other mage could use magic. This was a key reason why they were considered comparable to divine artifacts.\n\nYe Yinzhu did not move. He sat there, his gaze fixed on Ma Liang as he gradually sketched out the image of the silver dragon. His spiritual power could no longer sense a single trace of magical elements; even his Zither Magic was useless at this moment. He did not launch a physical attack with his Dou Qi, because he knew his Bamboo Dou Qi could never break through the silver halo surrounding Ma Liang. But he discovered that the hot current that had surged through his body during the battle with Nesta had appeared again. The immense external pressure seemed to make this current burn even more intensely.\n\nA subtle ripple suddenly appeared in his spiritual connection—it was a query from Zi. Clearly, the distant Zi sensed Ye Yinzhu's peril and was trying to communicate, hoping to be summoned to this world to help him face the powerful enemy.\n\nBut this time, Ye Yinzhu did not summon Zi. He could clearly sense that even Zi would be unable to withstand the summoning magic augmented by the Six Artifacts of the Silver Dragon. He would never wish even the slightest harm to come to Zi. So, he steadied his mind and, through their subtle connection, told Zi that he was fine.\n\nThe silver light grew increasingly brilliant, and a misty aura began to swirl above Ma Liang’s head. With every brushstroke, his face grew paler, as if he were under extreme strain. Large beads of sweat trickled down from his forehead, dripping onto his magic robe.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\" target=\"_blank\">Qidian.com</a> welcomes all readers.

Hehe.\n\n***\n\nSummoning the Gold Crystal Tyrannosaurus had already consumed a portion of his mana. Now, despite the aid of the Six Instruments of the Silver Dragon, the consumption of this summoning spell was simply too immense. If not for the Silver Dragon's Blood linking it all together, he would have already been drained of his magic and turned into a dried corpse.\n\nOn the dais, Nina suddenly smiled and turned to the head of the Summoning Department beside her. \"Vieri, how about a wager?\"\n\nVieri's gaze was completely captivated by the Six Instruments of the Silver Dragon. Without turning his head, he asked, \"Bet on what?\"\n\nNina smiled. \"Let's bet on the outcome of this match.\"\n\nOnly then did Vieri turn his head in surprise. \"What? You think there's still any suspense in this match? Haven't you seen that your Divine Music Department student is so suppressed he can't even continue playing? Do you really think he can still win?\"\n\nNina nodded very seriously. \"Yes, I do! I think he can win. In fact, I'm certain he will.\"\n\nVieri snorted in disdain. \"Head Nina, you aren't daydreaming, are you?\"\n\nNina smiled. \"If you don't believe me, then let's make a bet. If Yin Zhu wins, I want your Summoning Department's Eternal Substitute Puppet.\"\n\nVieri was aghast. \"You—how did you know the Eternal Substitute Puppet is in our Summoning Department?\" The moment he said it, he realized he had let it slip. It was too late to cover his mouth.\n\nNina smiled. \"So, do you dare to bet or not?\"\n\nVieri looked at the gradually forming Silver Dragon on the field, then at Nina's confident face and the other department heads who were watching the drama unfold with great interest. Gritting his teeth, he said, \"And if you lose? What will you give me?\"\n\nNina said calmly, \"If I lose, you may choose any three items from the Divine Music Department's treasury.\"\n\nHer words were met with a wave of gasps from those around them. The Divine Music Department was the wealthiest of all departments, a fact inseparable from Nina herself. Even if there were no divine artifacts in the Divine Music Department's treasury, the value of three of its treasures would be no less than that of a single divine artifact.\n\nVieri could not believe that Ye Yin Zhu had any chance of turning the tables at this stage of the match. His eyes darted about. \"Fine, I'll take that bet. Dean, please be our witness.\"\n\nFerguson glanced at the composed Nina with some surprise. Although he didn't know why Nina was so certain at a time like this, he still nodded. With a slight wave of his right hand in the air, he muttered, \"Praise Falan.\" A simple contract spell was completed.\n\nMa Liang finally finished the last, difficult stroke. In that instant, the five Silver Dragon Instruments soared into the air as the blood-red pattern magnified countless times. All five instruments simultaneously released an incomparably dazzling light. The Silver Dragon Scale expanded in a flash, the Silver Dragon Tooth arranged itself neatly, the Silver Dragon Heart moved to the center of the drawing, and the Silver Dragon Horn stood proudly at its forefront. The Silver Dragon Eye split into two, its intelligent and icy luster suddenly erupting. A giant silver dragon had materialized in the air above the Central Proving Ground.\n\nThis was the first time Ye Yin Zhu had seen a ninth-level magical beast. The Silver Dragon's body was not as large as he had imagined, just over ten meters long, only slightly larger than the Gold Crystal Tyrannosaurus. Its scales, however, were not as thick as the tyrannosaurus's, appearing crystalline and magnificent. Dazzling patterns shimmered on its silver draconic eyes and its single silver horn. Its four claws were slightly retracted beneath its belly, and the silver light around them seemed to be small whirlpools formed of magical elements. Its enormous wings stretched out to its sides like a massive screen blocking the sky. It hovered in mid-air, its formless majesty and the tangible pressure of its elemental energy seeming to suffocate the very earth. Every part of its body was surrounded by magical elements so dense they were almost physical, forming an elemental shield as strong as the First Order of the Purple Rank without the need for any incantation.\n\nWhen the Silver Dragon appeared, Ye Yin Zhu truly felt as if his body could no longer move. He could only just muster a sliver of his mental power to recall the Sea Moon's Pure Brilliance. Using every ounce of strength in his body, he stood up, bit by bit, like a bamboo that never bends, preferring to break rather than yield. Finally, he straightened his back, his eyes shining with a brilliant light.\n\nSupporting himself with his paintbrush, Ma Liang looked at the massive Silver Dragon in the sky, his eyes filled with a proud gleam. Although it had drained him of all his magical power and overdrawn his body to the point where he would need at least ten days to recover, he was still filled with pride for having unleashed such a powerful spell for the first time. The Silver Dragon's Strike—though it was only one strike, it was an attack with power comparable to the Purple Rank!\n\n\"Go, Silver Dragon. Defend your pride and dignity with your strength.\"\n\nAt his command, the great Silver Dragon flapped its wings. Carrying the Purple-Rank elemental shield that surrounded its body, it shot down toward Ye Yin Zhu like a silver meteor. Even if Ma Liang's mana was insufficient to truly control the Silver Dragon and unleash its strongest magical abilities, this simple charge alone was easily comparable to a Purple-Rank spell in intensity!\n\nThe silver meteor descended, leaving a dazzling tail flame in its wake. The air within the Central Proving Ground completely solidified, turning into a vacuum in an instant as all the elements were absorbed by the Silver Dragon. The dragon's oppressive majesty could be felt even through the proving ground's defensive barrier, making it hard for the spectating students to breathe.\n\n\"Yin—Zhu—.\" A sharp, mournful cry rang out from outside the field. A slender body slammed into the proving ground's defensive barrier with all its might. But no matter how hard they tried, it was impossible to break through a defense comparable to the Purple Rank!\n\nIn the space of a breath, the silver light arrived. It was not an impact, but a devouring. Though the Silver Dragon's manifestation was but a fleeting moment of glory, its destructive power was more than sufficient.\n\nSpreading his arms to his sides, Ye Yin Zhu seemed to close his eyes in enjoyment. Was he welcoming the arrival of death?\n\nFerguson grew tense, but Nina insisted he not stop the match.\n\nMa Liang grew tense. He was horrified to find that the Silver Dragon summon was even more terrifying than he had imagined; trying to retract the spell was now impossible. The Silver Dragon's charge was irreversible. His face grew even paler as he could only watch Ye Yin Zhu's proud, solitary figure be devoured by the Silver Dragon.\n\nEveryone was stunned by the scene before them. Was the rising star of the Divine Music Department, its first male student, to fall in a match just like this? At this moment, only Nina on the dais still wore a calm and composed smile.\n\nA golden halo appeared like a savior the instant the Silver Dragon made contact with Ye Yin Zhu. The halo emerged from his left wrist, and in a flash, his entire body was shrouded in a hazy golden brilliance.\n\nHe was already handsome and possessed an exceptionally elegant temperament. Now, enveloped in that golden light, Ye Yin Zhu was as dazzling as a deity favored by the heavens. It was as if he were a star, a star descended to the mortal realm.\n\nThe Silver Dragon's body swallowed him, but at the moment it completely enveloped him, the dragon seemed to turn transparent. Everyone could clearly see Ye Yin Zhu's golden-wrapped body passing right through the Silver Dragon's form.\n\nBOOM— What kind of power would be unleashed when all the magical elements within the proving ground exploded at once under the influence of the Six Instruments of the Silver Dragon?\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.cmfu.com</a> welcomes all readers to come and read.

For hundreds of years, this place, one of the most important in the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts, was now in a complete uproar.\n\n  The solid, magically protected ground was now completely shattered. Centered on where Ye Yinzhu had been standing, countless fragments of stone and gravel flew into the air as the entire ground sank. Fortunately, Ferguson and the teachers from the various departments had channeled their own magic into the overall defensive barrier beforehand, preventing the Central Proving Ground's protection from collapsing. Despite this, the violent tremors from the earth still caused large cracks to appear in the ground surrounding the Central Proving Ground.\n\n  Ma Liang's body was thrown through the air like a broken sack, slamming heavily against the defensive barrier. He passed out without even making a sound. As he lost consciousness, five streaks of silver light drifted out from the epicenter of the explosion and merged into the simple, ancient ring on his hand.\n\n  Luckily, he was relatively far from the center of the explosion. Furthermore, since he had summoned the Silver Dragon, his position was in the direction where the blast's aftershock was weakest. That was the only reason he wasn't killed by the powerful explosive force.\n\n  Teachers and students alike stared dumbfounded at the flying sand and stones in the arena, listening to the dense patter of gravel hitting the ground. Who could have imagined such a situation would occur in the Freshman Competition? Such formidable destructive power—not even a fifth-year graduate could produce it. And yet, this was truly just the final match of the Freshman Competition!\n\n  \"Quick, save them!\" Ferguson, being the dean, was the first to react. At this moment, none of the teachers were more anxious than he was. Had he just accepted such a once-in-a-century disciple with outstanding potential, only for him to be gone just like that?\n\n  The defensive barrier opened, and the billowing dust made many students cough. The teachers rushed from the main platform toward the proving ground.\n\n  Just then, a slender figure had already dashed into the proving ground at the first possible moment, his target the exact spot where Ma Liang had fallen.\n\n  \"I'll kill you!\" With a mournful and shrill roar, he lunged toward the unconscious Ma Liang with astonishing speed. In his hand, a bolt of black lightning flashed. He was so fast that even the teachers were caught off guard, able only to watch helplessly as the black blade, like the Grim Reaper's scythe, stabbed toward Ma Liang's heart.\n\n  \"Sula, don't!\" Just as no one could stop that black lightning, a streak of purple light suddenly shot out from the lingering dust.\n\n  *Ding*— The black blade paused, and Sula's slender figure came to an abrupt halt. The black blade in his hand had actually been pierced by a long, purple needle. The long needle remained embedded in the black blade, looking extremely peculiar.\n\n  Sula didn't lunge at Ma Liang again. He turned, staring dazedly at the slowly dissipating smoke, and murmured, \"Yinzhu, Yinzhu, you're not dead?\"\n\n  A tall, slender figure slowly walked out of the smoke. His black hair had long since turned gray from the dust, and his face was so dirty his handsome features were hidden, but the white robe on his body was still just as clean.\n\n  \"Yinzhu—\" At this moment, Sula forgot everything, absolutely everything. He didn't even notice that his voice had become sharp, not at all like a man's. The assassin's speed reached its limit in an instant, and like a young swallow, he threw himself into Ye Yinzhu's arms. His slender arms wrapped tightly around Ye Yinzhu's body, as if terrified he would disappear. Tears streamed from his eyes, his body trembling violently. The swing from great sorrow to great joy left his breathing extremely unstable.\n\n  \"Gently, gently, are you trying to strangle me? I'm dirty,\" Ye Yinzhu said with a small smile.\n\n  \"I don't care, I don't care. You scared me to death.\" His true emotions poured out, and Sula began to cry loudly, completely forgetting the occasion.\n\n  \"Alright, stop crying now.\" Ye Yinzhu comforted Sula, a little at a loss for what to do.\n\n  \"You broke my dagger. It was very expensive, you have to pay for it.\"\n\n  \"Okay, okay, I'll pay for it,\" Ye Yinzhu agreed, while remembering that all their money seemed to be with Sula anyway.\n\n  Ferguson and the teachers had already arrived at the center of the field. Where Ye Yinzhu had been standing, a massive crater over twenty meters in diameter had appeared. The Central Proving Ground was finished; it would take at least a month of repairs to be restored. But right now, Ferguson's mood couldn't be better. Ye Yinzhu was alright—what could possibly make him happier?\n\n  Vieri picked up the unconscious Ma Liang with a dazed expression. He truly didn't understand what had just happened. A Silver Dragon, that was a summoned Silver Dragon!\n\n  \"Ahem.\" Nina's cough sounded beside Vieri.\n\n  \"Director Vieri, don't forget our bet.\" The coldness on Nina's face was long gone, replaced with a victorious smile.\n\n  Vieri seemed to have suddenly realized something and shot up from the ground. \"Life Guardian, it was Life Guardian, wasn't it! You tricked me on purpose!\"\n\n  Nina put on a surprised expression. \"Tricked you on purpose? Did I? You were the one who agreed to bet with me; I certainly didn't force you. The Dean and all the teachers can prove it. Or are you saying it's fine for your student to use the Six Instruments of the Silver Dragon, which rival a divine artifact, but not for a student of our Divine Music Department to use Life Guardian? That doesn't seem very reasonable, does it?\"\n\n  \"You...\" Vieri stared dumbfounded at Nina, speechless.\n\n  Ferguson, standing to the side, coughed, trying hard to keep himself from laughing out loud. \"Alright, Director Vieri, a bet's a bet.\"\n\n  \"But, but Dean, my Eternal Stand-in Puppet...\"\n\n  Divine Music Department Stands.\n  Seeing Ye Yinzhu actually walk out of the dust, all the beauties of the Divine Music Department breathed a collective sigh of relief.\n\n  \"Hai Yang, you were pinching me so hard just now,\" Xiang Luan whispered with a laugh in Hai Yang's ear.\n\n  Hai Yang's chest was heaving. She glanced at her and said, \"But you just ripped the hem of my clothes. Were you afraid that if Ye Yinzhu died, you wouldn't be able to fulfill your promise?\"\n\n  Xiang Luan's pretty face flushed. \"Hai Yang, when did you become so sharp-tongued?\"\n\n  Hai Yang smiled faintly. \"And you? I've never seen you worry about a boy before.\"\n\n  Xiang Luan huffed. \"Besides, that guy Ye Yinzhu doesn't seem to like women. Otherwise, how could he ignore all the beauties in our Divine Music Department? Look, he's even hugging a man right now.\"\n\n  \"That's deep brotherly affection, a true display of emotion.\" After saying this, Hai Yang subconsciously blushed a little herself.\n\n  Dark Department Stands.\n\n  Yue Ming gently patted her chest. \"Thank goodness he's alright. Otherwise, who would go with me to return Ming Xue? He's really strong!\"\n\n  Wind Department Stands.\n\n  Roland watched Ye Yinzhu in the center of the field and became inexplicably excited. \"That damn guy, he actually couldn't be killed even by that. His life force is more tenacious than those stupid dragons.\"\n\n  Heavy Cavalry Stands.\n\n  Nesta laughed heartily. \"It looks like I have another rival.\"\n\n  Ferguson stood in the middle of the field, smiling as he addressed the entire audience. Without needing any sound amplification equipment, his voice carried to every stand. \"Next, I have a few announcements. First, the Freshman Competition is over. The champion is the Divine Music Department. Second place is the Summoning Department, and third place is the Heavy Cavalry Department. The student participants from these three departments will receive special training from the academy. At the same time, the academy will also waive all five years of tuition and dormitory fees for these fifteen students. The main combatants of the three departments will each receive weapons or magical items: one for the Heavy Cavalry Department, two for the Summoning Department, and three for the Divine Music Department. They may choose for themselves from the academy's treasury.\" These were the standard rewards for the Freshman Competition, and no one would question them.\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\">Qidian Chinese Network</a> welcomes all readers.

Thank you.\n\n  ————————————————————\n\n  Ferguson continued, \"Second, I officially announce that Ye Yinzhu is not only a student of the Divine Music Department but also my direct disciple. His previous jump in magical power from Red rank directly to Yellow rank was because a magical item I gifted him was concealing his true strength.\"\n\n  The moment these words were spoken, the entire audience erupted in an uproar. Many thought, *no wonder Ye Yinzhu is so strong, it turns out he's the Dean's disciple.* At the same time, this resolved all their doubts about his leapfrogging power increase. Who would dare question Ferguson, the Dean of the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts and the Chief Court Mage of the Milan Empire?\n\n  \"Third. The Beastmen's autumn grain raids are about to begin. To better enhance the strength of our academy's students, the academy will select a group of students to join the army and resist the foreign enemy together. Of course, the academy will choose the most outstanding students from each department to participate in this practical combat trial. Alright, the new student tournament ends here. Starting tomorrow, all departments will officially begin their classes. I believe you have all witnessed the strength of the two students in today's battle. If you want to become as strong as them, or even surpass them, you must put in more effort. I hope to see even more outstanding talents emerge from our Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts.\"\n\n  With the three announcements finished, this year's new student tournament was officially over. The students' studies would get on the right track starting tomorrow.\n\n  The Divine Music Department had undoubtedly become the biggest highlight of this new student tournament, stunning everyone. From the very first battle to the last, they were the ultimate dark horse, claiming the final championship. And as the main force of the Divine Music Department, Ye Yinzhu naturally became the most eye-catching figure among this year's new students. He had used his own strength to prove to everyone that a Divine Music Master was not a useless profession.\n\n  ...\n\n  \"Yinzhu, this Purple Bamboo Needle of yours is really sharp. It actually managed to pierce my dagger,\" Sula said with a relaxed expression, half-lying and half-sitting on his bed, toying with the needle that had stopped him from finishing off Ma Liang.\n\n  It was almost evening. Having finally sent off all the well-wishers, the two of them could finally relax.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu smiled. \"The Purple Bamboo Needle itself is extremely sharp and tough. When you focus Dou Qi into a single point, its penetrating power is naturally stronger. But that black dagger of yours looked pretty good. How was it so flimsy? I was only trying to knock it aside.\"\n\n  Sula said peevishly, \"I'm a poor man, what kind of good dagger would I have? By the way, Yinzhu, when did you become the Dean's disciple? How come I didn't know?\"\n\n  Ye Yinzhu said in a low voice, \"Actually, I only became the Dean's student after my match with Nesta that day. The Dean only said I was his disciple from the start to help me cover up the power level jump.\" He felt there was no need to hide anything from Sula. The way Sula had revealed his emotions when the match ended today was deeply imprinted in his mind, something he would never forget. Other than Zi, Ye Yinzhu already considered Sula his best friend.\n\n  Sula chuckled. \"Looks like the Dean really likes you. So, are you going to the front lines this time?\"\n\n  Ye Yinzhu said, \"I think so. Teacher told me to prepare. Sula, isn't this a time of peace? From what Teacher said today, it sounds like we're going to war with the Beastmen?\"\n\n  Sula rolled his eyes. \"Ye Yinzhu, you might as well call yourself Ye Idiot from now on. How can you not know so much common sense? The Beastman race lives in the bitter cold of the far northern wastelands. They don't know how to farm at all and can only rely on nature's food to survive. Or, through trade, they exchange specialties from the northern wastelands for grain from human kingdoms. In spring and summer, when plants are lush and animals reproduce, their food situation isn't too difficult. But once winter arrives, the Beastmen's food supply immediately becomes strained. Therefore, every autumn, the Beastmen dispatch their armies to find ways to get some grain from the borders of the three human kingdoms that adjoin their lands. To them, this is called 'riding the autumn wind.'¹ But the fighting is generally not on a large scale; it's mostly localized skirmishes. So, every autumn, the Milan Empire, the Ascoli Kingdom, and the Floro Kingdom concentrate their forces on the border to contend with the Beastmen and minimize their own losses as much as possible. And that gives us the border defense war we're about to join.\"\n\n  \"Us? Sula, are you going too?\" Ye Yinzhu looked at him in surprise.\n\n  Sula smiled smugly. \"The Assassin Department may not have been in the new student tournament, but an army can't do without our kind of profession when marching. The scouts the army usually deploys are just ordinary light cavalry. Assassins like us are the most welcome class of soldiers in the army. A good assassin can bring a lot of useful information to the army, and can even assassinate the enemy commander. As the top dog of the first-year Assassin Department, do you think I should go or not?\"\n\n  \"You're the top dog of the first-year assassins?\" As Ye Yinzhu spoke, the smile at the corners of his mouth grew wider.\n\n  \"What? Not convinced? I might not be able to beat you on a tournament stage. But if we were in a place with complex terrain, you wouldn't necessarily be my match.\" As he spoke, the dagger in his hand, the one with a hole pierced through it, flashed with a green light.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu was startled. Green rank Dou Qi, and mid-tier at that. In terms of Dou Qi intensity, Sula was actually above Nesta. This was something he had never expected.\n\n  \"Sula, I broke your dagger. Take this as compensation.\" Saying this, Ye Yinzhu took something out from his robes and tossed it to Sula.\n\n  Sula caught it. It was a humanoid sculpture carved from amethyst. Strangely, the sculpture had no facial features. On the surface, it didn't look special, but when Sula took it in his hand, he was surprised to find that the amethyst figurine contained a very strange elemental fluctuation. He couldn't quite tell what it was.\n\n  \"What is this thing?\" Sula asked curiously.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu said, \"Grandma Nina gave it to me when she came by this afternoon. She said she won it from the Summoning Department. It's called an Eternal Substitute Puppet, or something. You just have to drip your blood on it, and it will recognize you as its master. I think it's some kind of protective item.\"\n\n  \"What did you say? An Eternal Substitute Puppet?\" Sula shot up from the bed, staring at Ye Yinzhu in shock.\n\n  \"Yeah! An Eternal Substitute Puppet. What's wrong?\" Ye Yinzhu said very naturally.\n\n  Sula's voice held a slight tremor. \"Yinzhu, do you have any idea what an Eternal Substitute Puppet does?\"\n\n  Ye Yinzhu shook his head. \"Not specifically.\"\n\n  Sula's expression became much more serious. \"The Eternal Substitute Puppet is also known as the Body of Immortality. It's a low-tier divine artifact. It's a divine artifact!\"\n\n  \"Oh.\" Ye Yinzhu stretched his body, not at all surprised by the words \"divine artifact.\"\n\n  \"Hey, did you hear what I said?\" Sula was really rather dissatisfied with Ye Yinzhu's attitude.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu smiled. \"A divine artifact is a divine artifact. It's yours now.\"\n\n***\n**Translator's Notes:**\n1.  **Riding the autumn wind (打秋風, dǎ qiū fēng):** A Chinese idiom that means to take advantage of a situation for personal gain, or to sponge off someone.

    "content": "If you like this book, please vote, add it to your collection, and support Xiao San. Thank you.\n\n  —————————————————————\n\n  Sura’s entire body went rigid, his eyes staring blankly into Ye Yinzhu’s clear pupils. He… he actually gave a divine artifact to me. He gently shook his head. “No, I can’t accept it. Although I don’t know why Director Nina is so good to you, even gifting you a divine artifact, this is your possession. As a magician, you need it more than I do. The Eternal Substitute Puppet has only one function, which is unique among divine artifacts, and for this reason, it is only a low-tier one. However, its effect is no worse than any other divine artifact. Because its one and only ability is to grant immunity to all physical attacks, including Dou Qi.” Walking over to Ye Yinzhu, he held the amethyst figurine out to him again.\n\n  “Sura, are we friends?” Ye Yinzhu said with a frown.\n\n  “Of course we’re friends,” Sura answered without hesitation.\n\n  “If that’s the case, then between friends, there’s no ‘yours’ or ‘mine’—what’s mine is yours. How can I take back something I’ve given you? Do you think our friendship is less precious than a divine artifact?” A hint of anger had crept into Ye Yinzhu’s voice, and his clear eyes even held a look of hurt.\n\n  “But once the Eternal Substitute Puppet binds to a master, it cannot be changed, and it will disappear upon the master’s death. In the history of the Longqinus Continent, only three Eternal Substitute Puppets have ever appeared. The masters of two of them have already died. In other words, this is the last one! Its value cannot even be measured in money.”\n\n  Ye Yinzhu said no more. His eyes had returned to their calm state, but within that calm was an added layer of iciness. He stood up and said faintly, “I’m going for a walk. Sura, I hope it has a master by the time I get back.” After saying this, he patted Sura’s slender shoulder and turned to walk out of the room.\n\n  Sura stood there, completely stunned. Ever since he had met Ye Yinzhu, this was the first time he had seen such an expression on his face. He knew he had hurt Yinzhu. Glistening teardrops streamed down his cheeks. “Yinzhu, do you really think I’m more important than anything? You fool, you’re really a fool.” Looking at the amethyst figurine in his hand, he suddenly felt that this incomparably precious divine artifact was no longer so important. At least, compared to his relationship with Ye Yinzhu, it was just an object, and nothing more.\n\n  Wiping away his tears forcefully, Sura smiled. His smile was very sweet. He held the amethyst figurine in both hands as if he were holding the bond between him and Ye Yinzhu. He knew he had just received the most precious thing in the world. Without hesitation, he bit his finger and dripped a drop of crimson blood onto the amethyst figurine.\n\n  The blood vanished as if dropped onto a sponge. A faint halo of purple light rose from the base of the figurine, spreading over the entire statue in the blink of an eye. Gradually, the figurine began to change. The amethyst seemed to come alive as layers of purple light rippled outwards, and its form started to shift.\n\n ⃟The slender and tall figure of the crystal-clear amethyst figurine changed, its chest swelling slightly as delicate facial features emerged. A blush appeared on Sura's face; his blood was the bridge between him and the Eternal Substitute Puppet. After the amethyst figurine had completely transformed into a new shape, the faint purple light suddenly expanded and, just as Zi had once merged into Ye Yinzhu's body, it fused into Sura's.\n\n  Standing on the small path outside the villa, Ye Yinzhu looked at his villa dormitory and muttered to himself, “Sura, don’t let me down. If our friendship can be measured by objects, is it still friendship?”\n\n  He raised his hand, glanced at the address on the slip of paper in his palm, then looked back at his dormitory. Pushing off the ground, he executed several leaps with his Bamboo Dou Qi and disappeared at the end of the path.\n\n  As an important part of the Magic Division, the Summoning Department’s dormitories were also quite nice. But compared to the small, private villas for nearly every student in the Divine Music Department, there was still a considerable gap. Here, only the powerful or incredibly wealthy students could afford their own private dorm room. Ma Liang was clearly the former.\n\n  At this moment, Ma Liang was lying on his bed with a deep frown, his head aching. It wasn’t because he had over-exerted his magical power in the afternoon, but because Vieri, the head of the Summoning Department, had been pestering him here for an entire afternoon and had only just left. He felt a bit fortunate, though; fortunate that five of the Six Artifacts of the Silver Dragon, excluding the Silver Dragon Blood, had already bound to a master. Otherwise, Vieri might have actually used them to compensate for the loss of the Eternal Substitute Puppet.\n\n  “Ma Liang, I’m here.” A clear voice came from outside the dorm, jolting Ma Liang. He quickly sat up from his bed. “Brother Ye? Come in, quickly.”\n\n  Ye Yinzhu slipped inside. The note Ma Liang had given him on the training grounds today had the exact address of this room.\n\n  Ma Liang, a bit unsteady on his feet, pulled over a chair and said earnestly, “Brother Ye, thank you so much for today. I heard everything. If you hadn’t stepped in to stop it, I’m afraid I would have been finished off by your friend. I originally thought I could control the Silver Dragon, but who knew I would lose control at the last moment. Luckily, you’re a fortunate man, otherwise I really wouldn't know how to explain myself.”\n\n  Ye Yinzhu smiled. “Accidents are bound to happen in a match. It’s all in the past. You can just call me Yinzhu.”\n\n  Looking at him, Ma Liang also smiled. He suddenly realized that this heir of the Qin Sect was even more endearing than he had imagined, so pure that he wouldn't even hold a grudge.\n\n  Ma Liang walked to the window and glanced outside before turning back and saying in a low voice, “Yinzhu, I never thought I’d run into you at the Milan Academy of Magic and Martial Arts. If I'm not mistaken, you must be Sect Master Qin’s disciple. Only Sect Master Qin could train an expert as outstanding as you.”\n\n  Ye Yinzhu smiled. “What kind of expert am I? I had only just entered the Sword-Gall Zither-Heart realm during the match with Nesta the other day. You’re much stronger than me. If I hadn’t had the Life Guard to block your attack today, I would have lost long ago.”\n\n  Ma Liang gave a wry smile. “I wasn’t using my own power either. We both have magic items, and your Life Guard just happened to counter my one-use Silver Dragon. Alright, let's stop with the pleasantries. Did Sect Master Qin send you here?”\n\n  Ye Yinzhu nodded.\n\n  Ma Liang said thoughtfully, “Then that means there are now three of us from the Eight Sects of the Eastern Dragon in the academy. Yinzhu, you must be careful in everything you do from now on. Although I don’t know why the Dean covered for you on the matter of advancing beyond your grade, you might not be so lucky next time. As a member of the Eight Sects of the Eastern Dragon, you must be even more cautious, no matter what you do.”\n\n  Ye Yinzhu looked at him in surprise. “Why? Are the Eight Sects of the Eastern Dragon something to be ashamed of?”\n\n  A cold glint flashed in Ma Liang’s eyes. “Of course not. But our current strength is insufficient, far from being able to contend with the Seven Towers of Falan. So we can only endure. Otherwise, if we’re captured as heretics, we’ll never make it back alive.”\n\n  Ye Yinzhu frowned. “I don’t understand what we have to do with the Seven Towers of Falan.”\n\n  Ma Liang looked at him, somewhat astonished. “You don’t know? Didn’t Sect Master Qin tell you about our Eight Sects of the Eastern Dragon?”\n\n  Ye Yinzhu shook his head blankly and said, “Grandpa Qin never told me! He only said that I should hide my true strength from others as much as possible and not talk about our Qin Sect.”\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\">Qidian.com welcomes all readers to visit and read.

There will be another chapter at 8 PM tonight.\n\n——————————————————————————-\n\nJust as Ye Yinzhu was hesitating over what he should choose, he suddenly heard Nesta exclaim, \"Wow, what a huge sword! What kind of person could even use this?\"\n\nA sword? Ye Yinzhu, somewhat curious, walked over quickly. After circling a few treasure shelves, he saw the dumbfounded Nesta.\n\nNesta was staring at a weapon before him. It was a sword—an immense sword, so large it completely defied convention.\n\nThe treasure vault itself was very large, with a ceiling over ten meters high, yet the sword had to be placed diagonally. It was a meter wide, a full ten meters long, and half a meter thick. The entire blade was a deep blue. There was no blood groove on the blade; on a greatsword of this size, a blood groove would be meaningless. Its weight was simply inestimable—at least, Ye Yinzhu couldn't guess it. In the center of the dark blue blade was an intricate pattern of the same color, ancient and simple in style, attesting to its great age. If it weren't for the fact that it was resting diagonally, and for the massive hilt that was over three meters long, no one would have thought it was a sword.\n\nPerhaps because they weren't needed, there were no decorations on the sword's body or hilt aside from that one ancient pattern. But its heavy presence and the faint scent of blood made one feel that it was definitely more than just a simple display piece.\n\nSlowly approaching, Ye Yinzhu, like Nesta, ran his hand over the dark blue blade. Suddenly, a jolt like an electric shock shot through him. It was a domineering aura, and yet within that dominance that seemed capable of prying heaven and earth apart, there was also a strong sense of intimacy, as if this sword knew him, was calling out to him.\n\n\"Nesta, do you feel anything?\" Ye Yinzhu asked subconsciously.\n\nNesta shook his head blankly. \"Feel? Feel what? This sword is truly strange! I bet its weight alone could cleave an adult dragon in two. My Blood Soul Spear is already one of the longest among the Dragon Spears, and it's only about eight meters long. But this sword is actually over thirteen meters in length. This is just unbelievable. In terms of weight, I think only the Behemoths of the Far Northern Wasteland could use it, and they'd have to be Golden Behemoths. But, Behemoths have sharp claws; they never use any weapons.\"\n\nYe Yinzhu looked at him, puzzled. Could it be that he was the only one who could sense that domineering and intimate feeling? But why? He looked again at the faintly shimmering, dark blue blade. In its mirror-like surface, he saw his own reflection. Ye Yinzhu was surprised to find that in the sword's reflection, his own eyes were emitting a faint purple light. His originally handsome and gentle face, colored by those purple pupils, had become much more imposing and powerful.\n\nA faint warmth circulated through his meridians, and that feeling of being filled with power appeared once more. As he stared at the pattern on the giant blade, it suddenly seemed to change. The deep blue of the sword's body seemed to transform into a crystalline purple in that instant—a purple filled with a domineering and murderous air. The patterns shifted rapidly, and two large, ancient characters began to shine in the very center of the sword.\n\nZi—, Jing—¹\n\nThese two simple characters made Ye Yinzhu's heart tremble. Amethyst Sword? Was that its name?\n\n\"I'll take this one. Nesta, you don't want it too, do you?\"\n\n\"Huh? Yinzhu, are you crazy? Are you really planning to become a warrior? But this sword is way too big; it's not suitable for you,\" Nesta said, looking at him in astonishment.\n\nYe Yinzhu shook his head. \"No, of course I'm not going to be a warrior. But I like this sword. Perhaps a friend of mine will like it, too. I'll take it.\"\n\nNesta said helplessly, \"Who's to say no? You're the champion. Picking three items gives you plenty of room to splurge. Suit yourself. Still, in terms of size, this sword is definitely number one in here. I'm not interested in it; I'd much rather find a suitable suit of armor.\" After saying this, not daring to waste any more time, he hurried off towards the area of the treasure vault where the armor was kept.\n\nYe Yinzhu didn't put the Amethyst Greatsword into his spatial ring, because he remembered Ferguson saying that all the items here had a magic seal on them. Besides, this greatsword was simply too large, its weight far more than a thousand catties.² He could only leave it here for now and put it directly into his spatial ring after the hour was up and Ferguson removed the magic brand.\n\nReleasing his hand from the Amethyst Greatsword, the feeling of intimacy immediately vanished. Ye Yinzhu turned, preparing to look deeper into the treasure vault. He wanted to see if there were any qins³ here. If he could find an ancient qin, that would naturally be his best choice.\n\nJust as he turned to leave the weapons area, a nondescript object suddenly caught his eye. It was a dagger, pitch-black from hilt to tip, which made it stand out among the other treasure-lit items. The strangest thing was that it was completely non-reflective, a trait somewhat similar to Sula's dagger.\n\nTaking a few steps forward, Ye Yinzhu subconsciously picked up the dagger. It was about one chi and two cun long,⁴ falling somewhere between a short sword and a dagger. The hilt was four cun, and the blade eight cun. Carved at the end of the hilt was a ferocious demon's head. Its eyes, in particular, were two tiny inlaid rubies that flickered with an eerie glow.\n\nIn complete contrast to the Amethyst Greatsword, which had felt intimate to the touch, the moment this dagger entered his hand, Ye Yinzhu felt an intense sense of revulsion. A frigid aura instantly traveled up his palm and through his meridians, spreading throughout his entire body. It felt as if every pore on his skin had sealed shut from the cold, a deeply uncomfortable sensation. There seemed to be a very faint black aura covering the dagger's surface, and it was likely because of this aura that no part of the dagger reflected light, not even the two rubies.\n\nSoon, Ye Yinzhu understood why he felt such repulsion towards this dagger. The fluctuations of dark element on it were utterly terrifying. A massive amount of dark element seemed to be sealed within the dagger by some kind of magic, continuously emitting faint traces of a cold, evil sensation.\n\nAlthough he didn't like it, Ye Yinzhu could clearly sense that this dagger was very powerful. The moment he picked it up, the light emanating from all the surrounding weapons and armor dimmed, leaving only the Amethyst Greatsword standing there, unmoved.\n\n*This is it, then.* Although he disliked it, Sula was an assassin; he would surely love this kind of non-reflective dagger. That day, in his haste, he had pierced Sula's dagger with his Divine Purple Bamboo Needle, breaking the not-so-strong magic array on it. Although he had already given the Eternal Substitute Puppet to Sula as compensation, after the four girls from the Divine Music Department had refused his kind offer, he had decided to choose a dagger from here to compensate Sula.\n\nYe Yinzhu placed the dagger next to the Amethyst Greatsword, planning to come back and get them both after choosing his final item. Suddenly, the deep blue light on the Amethyst Greatsword flashed, and an overwhelming, domineering aura erupted from it. Accompanied by the clear cry of a dragon, the black dagger was actually knocked into the air by that domineering aura, streaking past Ye Yinzhu like a black light. The blade of the dagger buried itself completely into a nearby treasure shelf.\n\n***\n\n¹`紫晶` (zǐ jīng) means Amethyst.\n²A `斤` (jīn), or catty, is a traditional Chinese unit of mass, approximately 0.5 kg or 1.1 lbs.

The third chapter for today is being posted now.\n\n  —————————————————————-\n\n  Although it only grazed past and didn't actually make contact, the instantaneous cold still made Ye Yinzhu tremble slightly. The cold from the dagger was a cold filled with deathly stillness. Could it be that the Amethyst Greatsword was repelling it? When he turned back to look at the Amethyst Greatsword, he suddenly sensed from its blade the presence of a sovereign ruling the world. That's right, a sovereign ruling the world.\n\n  \"Yinzhu, what's wrong?\" Ma Liang and Nesta rushed over at almost the same time. Ye Yinzhu didn't hide anything and recounted what had just happened, causing the two to marvel at it.\n\n  Ma Liang said, \"This dagger is nice, I like it. Too bad I'm not a warrior. As for this greatsword, I'm not so impressed. No matter how good it is, what's the use if you can't wield it? Yinzhu, you better think this through!\"\n\n  Ye Yinzhu smiled faintly and said, \"I've made my choice and I don't want to change it. No matter what, I really like it. Alright, you two go pick your things. This dagger and greatsword are both mine now. Anyway, with Nesta's personality, he would never use a dagger. I'm not wrong, am I?\"\n\n  Nesta laughed heartily and said, \"You really do know me. I've already chosen my prize. It's over there. I'll put it on and show you guys later.\" After speaking, he immediately ran off in excitement.\n\n  Ma Liang also continued his treasure-hunting journey, while Ye Yinzhu began to look around the treasury.\n\n  Time passed, second by second. The one-hour limit was almost up, but Ye Yinzhu still hadn't chosen his third prize. He had walked a rough circle around the entire treasury but hadn't found any trace of a guqin. Moreover, for some reason, after seeing the black dagger and the Amethyst Greatsword, he found himself looking down on all the other items, whether they were magical artifacts, weapons, or armor. Or rather, nothing particularly caught his fancy.\n\n  \"There's so much good stuff here, what a shame we can only pick two. Yinzhu, have you finished choosing?\" Ma Liang asked as he walked over to Ye Yinzhu.\n\n  \"Not yet. I still have one left, and I don't know what to choose. They don't have the guqin I want.\"\n\n  Ma Liang said, \"Maybe you just haven't found it. I think there's a lot of stuff here. I saw some other musical instruments just now, so how could there not be a single guqin?\" At this point, he lowered his voice and said, \"Doesn't your Qin Sect have some special method for finding zithers?\"\n\n  Hearing him say that, a light suddenly flashed in Ye Yinzhu's clear eyes. That's right! How could I have forgotten that method? As he thought this, he immediately took action. He summoned the Sea-Moon's Pure Brilliance Zither from his spatial ring, cradling it in his left arm and gently stroking it with his right hand. A faint yellow magical energy quietly appeared on the four fingers of his right hand. As his fingers swept across the strings, a low hum sounded.\n\n  The treasury was a sealed space. As soon as the zither's note sounded, it instantly echoed throughout the entire vault. After the note rang out, Ye Yinzhu quickly pressed his right hand on the strings to stop the reverberation, simultaneously turning his head to listen, his spirit completely focused.\n\n  The zither's note echoed within the treasury. Suddenly, his eyes lit up with joy, and he walked briskly in a certain direction.\n\n  When he was learning the zither, Qin Shang had once told him that a good guqin will produce a certain resonance when it hears the sound of another guqin. And this resonant sound, a type of harmonic vibration, could only be heard by a Divine Music Master. Now, amidst the notes of the Sea-Moon's Pure Brilliance, he had indeed captured such a sound from one end of the treasury. The resonant sound was extremely crisp, unlike the deep hum of most guqins. But Ye Yinzhu was confident he wasn't mistaken. Although the guzheng and pipa are also string instruments, their sounds have more of a clang and less of a guqin's melodious and distant quality. What kind of guqin could this be?\n\n  Guided by the zither's sound, Ye Yinzhu soon arrived at a corner of the treasury. Ma Liang, out of curiosity, followed behind him. This was another curio shelf, on which various magical items were displayed, emitting faint halos of light. There was no guqin on it.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu put away the Sea-Moon's Pure Brilliance and, using his magical energy to augment his hearing, carefully approached the source of the crisp sound.\n\n  Finally, he pinpointed the exact location of the sound. It was actually a ring—that's right, a ring. The ring's design was simple, made of yellow jade, appearing lustrous but without any glow. The zither's hum was actually coming from it.\n\n  *This is a spatial ring,* Ye Yinzhu immediately identified the ring's property. At the same time, he was greatly shocked. *To still be able to hear the zither's resonance through the barrier of a spatial ring—what kind of guqin could this be! It's too incredible.* Whether it was the five guqins of the Qin Sect that he had lost, or his current Sea-Moon's Pure Brilliance, none of them could be sensed at all while inside a spatial ring. But this guqin was different. That could only prove one thing: the guqin hidden in this ring was incomparable to any guqin Ye Yinzhu had ever seen.\n\n  Picking up the ring, Ye Yinzhu tentatively used his spiritual energy to communicate with it. Generally speaking, as long as a spatial ring has not bound to a master, it won't have a spiritual imprint, and any mage can use their spiritual energy to communicate with the ring and retrieve the items inside. Of course, a mage wouldn't store valuable items in a spatial ring without a spiritual imprint. But this ring before him was clearly an exception.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu's spiritual energy easily found its target. Following the connection and activation of his spiritual energy, with a flash of light, a guqin had already appeared out of thin air in his hands.\n\n  It was a guqin that was orange all over. Its style was simple and archaic. The seven strings were crystal clear and translucent, made of some unknown material. A faint layer of orange light flowed over it. Just by looking at the light on the zither, one could almost feel the aura of sorrow it emitted. The resonance of the strings continued, like a sob, like a soft hum. Although the strings hadn't been formally plucked, the crisp clarity in the sound was intoxicating, making one forget themselves and the world.\n\n  Holding the zither with one hand, gently stroking it with the other, Ye Yinzhu was completely dazed. At this very moment, his eyes were filled with a tender affection. It was immersion, complete immersion.\n\n  Ma Liang stood behind him and didn't disturb him. Although Ma Liang didn't understand zithers very well, he knew that at this moment, Yinzhu had entered a special state. And what had led him into this state was this strange guqin. There were no elemental fluctuations on the guqin, but there was emotion. Whether it be weapons, armor, or other types of magical items, they are generally divided into five tiers, from lowest to highest: Common, Fine, Spirit, Soul, and Divine. Among them, the primary characteristic of Soul and Divine-tier items is emotion. The existence of emotion is due to the presence of a soul within Soul and Divine-tier items. For example, a top-grade Soul item like the Silver Dragon Six-Piece Set possesses the noble and domineering emotion of a silver dragon. And now, this orange guqin before him was the item with the richest emotion Ma Liang had ever seen. Even his Silver Dragon Six-Piece Set couldn't come close to comparing with it. He didn't know what it was exactly, but he knew clearly that Ye Yinzhu had truly found a treasure this time.\n\n  Just as Ma Liang had imagined, Ye Yinzhu was now completely immersed in another realm. His mind had entered an orange space. Everything around him had disappeared. There was only the orange guqin, humming softly.\n***\n¹Xiao San (小三), literally \"Little Three,\" is a common nickname used by the author for himself.",

Thank you.\n\n***\n\nA voice, faint and ephemeral, resounded deep within Ye Yinzhu's heart. The voice was sorrowful and clear, its fluctuating emotions seemingly confiding a wondrous melody in secret.\n\n\"I am a pearl in God's hand. In God's hand, I have reincarnated for five hundred years.\n\nFive hundred years ago, people called me Mingzhu. I was a girl named Lan Mingzhu.\n\nIn my eighteenth year, I fell in love with a man named Qin Zhi. He was twenty years older than me, but I still loved him, loved him without a single reservation. I remember it was a morning bathed in sunlight; I was chasing a lovely white-feathered bird and came to a maple forest. Then I heard the sound of a qin, clear and melodious—like the gentle tranquility of a calm stream. It was the music of the heavens!\n\nI saw him then, Qin Zhi, a man in white with sharply defined features. He sat amidst the red leaves that covered the ground, the hair at his temples hanging softly by his face. His hands, light as flowing water, caressed the orange body of the qin before him, and from it came that heavenly music that could intoxicate all of creation. From that moment on, I fell irrevocably in love with him. Following that melodious, cloud-like qin music, accompanied by the falling red leaves that filled the sky, I couldn't help but dance the *Ni Shang*.² Just like that, amidst a world of red leaves filling the sky and covering the ground, I danced for a strange man in white!\n\nThe Lan family of Landias, their power overshadowed the world, their wealth surpassed all. But how I wished I were just an ordinary girl! But I was not. I am Lan Mingzhu, the sole cherished daughter of the head of the Lan family. Qin Zhi, the man twenty years my senior whom I loved so desperately, was just a wanderer with no fixed home, a minstrel, not even considered a Divine Music Master—a minstrel who made a living by playing his qin—\n\n'His status is shabby, he is too old, it would damage the Lan family's reputation, he is not—worthy!' my father said. And so, we were forbidden from seeing each other.\n\nBut I am the young lady of the Lan family. I have never been afraid of anything or anyone. I am my father's only daughter, so even though I had seen him beat a servant to death with my own eyes for making a mistake, I was still not afraid of him.\n\nI tried every means possible to find him, and I told everyone frankly: I love him, and no matter what, I will be with him.\n\nOne night, during a drizzling rain, when I snuck out again to find him, I saw that he had already collapsed on the ground, the blood on his body blossoming in the dark night like a fresh, red rose!\n\n'My father did this. It was him, it was him...' I thought!\n\nHe once told me: if I were happy once, he might only be happy for me for a few days; but if I were sad once, he would surely feel my pain for years. But now my father had killed him! I did not shed a tear, because my tears had already fallen in my heart—my face was a mask of wild laughter, like a lily dancing wantonly in the wind—demonic, mysterious\n\n—That was my father's masterpiece!\n\n...\n\n—I swear, I only wanted to scare him. I truly never intended to kill my father. It was I who put that snake in my father's bed. It was my revenge for him killing Qin Zhi, but I truly was not prepared to kill him. But there is only one truth: I killed my father! Yes, I killed the father who loved me, doted on me, let me do as I pleased, who wouldn't even glare at me if I pulled his beard! No matter how he wasn't a good person to others, to me, he was a good father!\n\nAnd so, there was nothing left in this world for me to cling to. I used a pair of scissors to draw a graceful arc on my wrist, and then I smiled—with nothing left to tie me to this world.\n\nI became a pearl in God's hand. In God's hand, I pleaded for five hundred years. Ever since I learned of God's existence, I understood that anything was possible. I begged God to let me see him. God would always tell me that cause and effect are determined by heaven, that our fate had run its course; even if I saw him again, he would no longer recognize me. I said I didn't mind, that I just wanted to see him, to see the man I had loved and missed for five hundred years.\n\nGod said that I was already a part of him. If I insisted on going, I must remember not to shed a tear. God emphasizes a state of mind that cannot be tainted by anything of the mortal world, cannot influence anything in the mortal world. The heart must be calm—without shock, without joy, without sorrow, without anger.\n\nI said I would not cry. My reason was that I had already reincarnated in God's hand for five hundred years and had long since developed a divine connection. I was only going to see him, to fulfill a long-held wish, and then I would return to continue my reincarnation in God's hand.\n\nGod let me become a beautiful butterfly.\n\nOne day, two days... I flew over the boundless ocean.\n\nOne month, two months... I flew across the vast desert.\n\nOne year, two years... I crossed mountain after mountain.\n\nI finally arrived at that maple forest. Once again, red leaves danced through the sky! His current life was just as it was five hundred years ago, free and unrestrained. But my joy was fleeting, for I saw a person, a young girl in a pink silk dress, dancing lightly before him. It was the same orange qin, and he was playing *Jing Ye Si*.³ His face was full of smiles, his eyes filled with only her silhouette.\n\nHe—took her hand, his eyes full of deep affection, and said, 'You are so beautiful.'\n\nThey leaned against each other. 'You are so beautiful.' He had said the same thing to me in this very forest five hundred years ago.\n\nI don't mind. I just came to see him. Truly, that's all...\n\nWho says I don't mind? How could I not mind? Could I do it? I could not. I overestimated myself.\n\nI flew before his eyes, I flew to his ear, circling him and screaming, 'I am Mingzhu, your Mingzhu from five hundred years ago, do you know that?'\n\nHe couldn't hear me. He just said tenderly to the girl, 'Ya, look how lovely this butterfly is!' But the girl pouted coquettishly, 'Are you saying I'm not lovely?' He immediately grew nervous and hurried to explain, 'No, no, you are the most beautiful and lovely person in the world. Even this butterfly cannot compare to you!'\n\nI cried. I finally cried. I still cried.\n\n—God said not to cry!\n\nI remembered certain things:\nThat orange qin... the wondrous melody... the red maple leaves like fire...\n\n—I felt myself disappearing. I seemed to be growing fainter and fainter...\n\nAfter turning into a wisp of light smoke, I slipped into the body of the qin resting on his lap! God's voice echoed in my ear: 'After you shed a tear, you will become the thing you think of in that instant, and you will never reincarnate again...'\n\nI became a qin spirit, the spirit of the qin in his hands. I often think of what happened in the maple forest five hundred years ago, and at those times, my emotions become extremely agitated, unstoppable like a cascading waterfall or a torrential rain; and I also often become as quiet and tranquil as I was when reincarnating in God's hand, without desire or want—what I want to say is, all of these emotions were expressed through the music of the qin. I hope he could understand!\n\nPerhaps he truly did understand me.\n\nHe abandoned everything in the mortal world, dedicating his heart to the qin.\"\n\n***\n¹ **Xiao San**: Literally \"Little Three,\" a common nickname used by the author, Tang Jia San Shao.\n² ***Ni Shang***: The \"Rainbow Skirt Dance,\" a famous dance from the Tang Dynasty.\n³ ***Jing Ye Si***: \"Quiet Night Thought,\" one of the most famous poems by the Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai, often set to music.",

    "content": "Happy Lantern Festival to everyone.\n\n  ——————————————————————————————-\n\n  \"He traveled thousands of miles to retrieve the thousand-year-old paulownia wood from the Southern Mountain, soaked it in forty-nine different medicinal herbs, and gently roasted it over a low flame for eighty-one days. He then air-dried it under the gentle sun for one hundred and eight days. Taking the strings from that orange zither—the very strings that held my soul—he spent three years crafting a new instrument: Flowing Cascade of Pearls.\n\n  I became the zither soul of Flowing Cascade of Pearls.\"\n\n  The orange world vanished, and everything around him returned to reality. Ye Yinzhu suddenly felt that his face was wet. Only then did he realize, to his astonishment, that he was already covered in tears.\n\n  Crystalline teardrops dripped onto the crystalline zither strings, shattering into countless smaller beads that quietly rolled away. It was impossible to tell if it was the person weeping, or the zither.\n\n  Flowing Cascade of Pearls. It was Flowing Cascade of Pearls. Qin Shang had once spoken of this zither. To describe Flowing Cascade of Pearls, Qin Shang had used only a single, simple phrase: the finest of the finest among zithers! And that man named Qin Zhi was precisely the name of the first Sect Master of the Zither Sect.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu didn't know why Flowing Cascade of Pearls was here, but he knew that he would never be parted from this zither. He would forever guard her, share in her sorrow, and bear her grievances.\n\n  Before leaving the Azure Sea, Qin Shang had once told Ye Yinzhu that if he ever wanted his power to compare to that of the Falan Seven Towers, he must find a divine artifact among zithers.\n\n  What was a divine artifact among zithers? Naturally, it was a zither. In the present age, only three zithers could be called divine artifacts. Flowing Cascade of Pearls, with Lan Mingzhu as its soul, was one of them.\n\n  \"Yinzhu, what's wrong?\" Ferguson's concerned voice rang out, pulling Ye Yinzhu from his melancholy. He realized his arms were clutching Flowing Cascade of Pearls even tighter.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu looked at Ferguson, as well as Nesta and Ma Liang. By now, Nesta had donned a suit of dark red armor adorned with dazzling patterns, which, combined with his tall frame, made him look all the more imposing. The armor set, at least in color, was a perfect match for his Blood Soul Spear. Ma Liang, on the other hand, had changed into a magic robe with a row of gray crystals on the chest and held a necklace made of some unknown gemstones.\n\n  \"Teacher, I want this zither. Is that alright?\" There was no pleading in his eyes, only resolve.\n\n  Ferguson smiled faintly. \"Of course, you can. It is a blessing for a fine zither to fall into the hands of an outstanding Divine Musician. Even I didn't know that such an emotionally rich zither was kept here in the treasury.\"\n\n  Even after returning to the classroom, Ye Yinzhu's emotions had not yet recovered from the ethereal story of Flowing Cascade of Pearls. He didn't know if zither souls truly existed, but that story was so beautifully poignant. Perhaps it was because his tears had touched the strings where the zither soul resided. Even now, with Flowing Cascade of Pearls stored away in his spatial ring, Ye Yinzhu could still clearly feel its strings vibrating in unison with his own heartstrings.\n\n  A topaz ring now adorned the middle finger of his left hand—the topaz ring that housed Flowing Cascade of Pearls. Ye Yinzhu had already decided that nothing else would ever be placed in this ring besides Flowing Cascade of Pearls.\n\n  The one lecturing on the stage was a female teacher in her forties. Although Ye Yinzhu didn't recognize her, she certainly recognized the main champion of the Divine Music Department. Seeing him walk in looking so lost and sit down next to Lan Xi, she didn't say anything and continued her lesson. Unfortunately, Ye Yinzhu didn't hear a single word of that first day's class.\n\n  \"Yinzhu, what's wrong?\" Lan Xi poked him gently, asking in a low voice.\n\n  \"Huh?\" Ye Yinzhu snapped awake with a start. His not-so-quiet exclamation immediately drew a ripple of soft laughter from the pretty girls, and Lan Xi blushed crimson with embarrassment, lowering her head, not daring to look at the teacher.\n\n  \"Student Ye Yinzhu, do you have a question?\" the female teacher asked, her gaze gentle.\n\n  Ye Yinzhu sat there呆ly. In the girls' eyes, his handsome, dazed look was rather adorable.\n\n  \"Teacher, do musical instruments really have souls of their own?\"\n\n  \"Of course, they do. As a Divine Musician, if you wish to perform even more wondrous music, you must first feel the soul of the instrument. Perhaps it is an ethereal, illusory thing, but I believe that even the most ordinary instrument has a soul.\"\n\n  His dazed eyes gradually grew clear. Ye Yinzhu stood up from his seat and bowed respectfully to the female teacher. \"Thank you, Teacher. I understand now.\"\n\n  The school bell, amplified by magic, rang at that exact moment, ending the first day of classes. The afternoon was for free practice. The teaching style at Milan Magic and Martial Academy was very relaxed. And the students who were able to study here knew how to work hard. Of course, the Divine Music Department, known as the number one department, was an exception.\n\n  Walking out of the academic building, Ye Yinzhu let out a long breath and stretched his body. By now, his mood had returned to normal. The teacher's words had enlightened him. All instruments have souls; Flowing Cascade of Pearls had one, and so did Sea Moon's Clear Brilliance. The fact that he could feel the emotions of Flowing Cascade of Pearls and listen to her story proved that she had already accepted him.\n\n  When Ye Yinzhu returned to his dormitory, Sula was already back. The Divine Music Department's dorms were naturally close to their academic building, but they were a great distance from the Martial Arts Division.\n\n  \"Sula, did your class end early? How did you get back so soon?\"\n\n  \"I rushed back to cook for you!\" Sula said excitedly while busying himself in the kitchen. \"Yinzhu, I tested the speed-enhancing effect of the Eternal Stand-in Puppet today. It's even better than I imagined. It increased my speed by at least thirty percent.\"\n\n  Ye Yinzhu smiled. \"Any magical item can only display its greatest power in the hands of the most suitable person. You work so hard every day cleaning the room and cooking for me. Let me pay you some wages first.\"\n\n  Sula chuckled. \"Wages for me? Do you have any money? Your pay from Piao Lan Court hasn't come in yet.\"\n\n  Ye Yinzhu grinned. With a flash of light from his hand, the black-bladed dagger he had chosen from the treasury appeared in his grasp. He held it out to Sula. \"How long do you think this will cover?\"\n\n  Seeing the dagger, Sula first froze, then immediately realized that Ye Yinzhu had specifically chosen it for him from the treasury today. He wiped the water from washing vegetables off his hands and took it.\n\n  \"This... this is...\" The icy aura, the wicked sharpness, the ruby eyes of the demon—every detail captivated him. Sula's body trembled, a tremor he could barely control.\n\n  \"Angel's Sigh. This... is this really Angel's Sigh?\" Sula snapped his head up, his eyes filled with shock as he looked at Ye Yinzhu.\n\n  \"So its name is Angel's Sigh! Who would have thought? It looks so ferocious, but it has such a nice name. Looks like it's a good one, no wonder Teacher seemed a bit pained when I took it and the Amethyst Greatsword,\" Ye Yinzhu said nonchalantly.\n\n  \"Nice name? Do you know that Angel's Sigh has another title?\" Sula gripped the dagger and raised his hand, tracing a beautiful arc in the air. A cold, sinister aura washed over them, making Ye Yinzhu shiver.\n\n  \"What is it?\"\n\n  \"Cursed Blade,\" Sula said in a low voice. \"Although it isn't a divine artifact, it's a high-tier soul artifact. The Cursed Blade's attack power increases by two hundred percent when striking a magical defense. When striking a physical defense, its attack power increases by one hundred fifty percent. It's silent and soundless, and no matter what battle aura is channeled into it, it will not emit any light. The reason it's called the Cursed Blade is that anyone wounded by it will bleed to death without stopping, unless treated with light magic of the cyan rank or higher. In the world of us assassins, though it may not be a divine artifact, we call it the uncrowned king of the assassin world.\"\n\n  \"Haha, looks like I picked a treasure. Sula, how long do you think this will cover as wages?\" Ye Yinzhu said, a little smugly.\n\n  Sula said irritably, \"To a warrior or a magician, Angel's Sigh might just be a decent weapon, but to us assassins, it's practically a priceless treasure. This as wages? Its value would be more than enough to buy all the slaves in a city. You fool, you're always giving things away, and it's either a divine artifact or a soul artifact. You're a real wealth-scattering child.\"¹\n\n  A rare, mischievous smile appeared on Ye Yinzhu's innocent face. \"I think it's a great deal! I give it to you, and you clean my room and cook for me for the rest of our lives. This thing is useless to me anyway.\"\n\n***\n¹ A \"wealth-scattering child\" (散財童子) is a term originating from the Buddhist figure Sudhana, a youth who gave away his wealth. It is now used to describe someone who spends or gives away valuable things freely.",

    "content": "Finally made it back before 8. Went home to have dinner with my parents, and updated as soon as I got back. Xiao San¹ here wishes all my readers a happy Lantern Festival, and may you always be reunited with family and full of joy.\n\n***\n\n“You…” A blush crept up Sula’s ordinary face. He stared at Ye Yinzhu, for a moment so dazed he couldn't speak. He realized his heart was pounding violently. Everything around him faded into insignificance; in his mind, there was only the sentence Ye Yinzhu had just spoken.\n\n“Hey, snap out of it. I think the stuff in your pot is about to burn.” Ye Yinzhu tapped Sula on the forehead.\n\n“Ah—my pork ribs!” Sula cried out, grabbing Angel's Sigh and running into the kitchen. While busying himself, he shouted, “Yinzhu, I’ll take this. But don't think I'm going to wait on you for the rest of your life. We're friends, so what's yours is mine.”\n\nYe Yinzhu chuckled. “Whatever you say. Just don't ask me for a commission from now on.” In truth, what little money he had was all with Sula; the term ‘penniless’ couldn't have been more fitting for him.\n\nThe weather grew colder day by day, and only the bright midday sun could still bring a bit of warmth. Neither Ye Yinzhu nor Sula had classes in the afternoon, so after lunch, they headed straight for the city of Milan. Yinzhu hadn’t been to Piao Lan Xuan for two days. Now that the competition was over, it was the perfect time to come back to work.\n\n“Yinzhu, did you know? In the few days you were away from Piao Lan Xuan, so many people were asking us waiters about you,” Sula said with a smile.\n\nYe Yinzhu asked naively, “Asking what?”\n\n“You idiot, asking why you weren't there, of course. We could only say you'd taken leave. I never thought you'd be so popular. But your guqin playing really is incredible. It's a good thing Boss An Ya told all the waiters not to reveal that you're a student at the Milan Academy. Otherwise, you'd never have any peace at the academy either. From my observations, although Piao Lan Xuan is in a remote location, everyone who can afford to drink tea there has an impressive status. And they're all high nobles.”\n\n“Sula, you know so much. It seems like there's nothing you don't know,” Ye Yinzhu said, looking at him with a hint of admiration.\n\nSula said proudly, “Of course. You think everyone is like you, you little idiot?”\n\n“Am I little? I'm much taller than you.” Ye Yinzhu measured them up; he was a good half-head taller than Sula.\n\n“What's the use of being tall? From now on, you should call me Teacher Sula. Look how much I've taught you.”\n\nYe Yinzhu said in surprise, “Aren't only old people able to be teachers? Sula, is it possible you're not as young as you look, and are actually…”\n\n“You? You're driving me crazy. ‘The skilled one is the teacher,’ don't you get it?!”\n\n“Nope.”\n\nSula was speechless.\n\nWhen the two arrived at Piao Lan Xuan, it hadn't opened for business yet. As soon as they entered, they ran into Dida. Ever since they started working here, both Sula and Ye Yinzhu had become very popular. Ye Yinzhu, naturally, was popular because he played the guqin well. Sula, on the other hand, worked quickly and was very neat, so the other waiters looked out for him too. Perhaps because the waiters here earned good wages, there was almost never any conflict among them.\n\n“Yinzhu, you're finally here. If you hadn't come back soon, I'd have gone deaf from all the customers' questions.” Dida teased Ye Yinzhu as he let the two of them in.\n\nSula glanced at Yinzhu and said, “I'm going to change into my work uniform. You head on up. I'll bring you some tea in a bit.”\n\n“Okay,” Yinzhu replied. Accompanied by Dida, he went upstairs toward the special spot where he played every day.\n\n“Brother Dida, I'm really sorry. I had some things to take care of at the academy these last two days, so I…”\n\nDida smiled. “It's no problem. The boss said that if you have things to do, you should go take care of them and not worry about us here. Besides, your pay is calculated by the day. But, I've noticed that the boss really likes your music. Every time you play, she sits alone at the top of the third-floor stairs and watches you. She'll sit there for the whole afternoon. Of course, we all love the sound of your guqin, too. It's an absolutely intoxicating experience.”\n\nAs they spoke, Ye Yinzhu had already reached his special spot. After he sat down, Dida lowered the gauze curtain, making it impossible for people outside to see him. Ye Yinzhu liked it this way, as it allowed him to play without being disturbed. Behind him was the giant, ancient tree. Whenever he sat here, he seemed to feel the tree's heartbeat. The fresh air and the sense of affinity invigorated his body and mind, allowing him to better express his music.\n\nAs the sounds of chatter drifted in from outside, Piao Lan Xuan began its business for the day. Just then, the gauze curtain was lifted, and Sula poked his head in.\n\n“Here, have some tea before you start. Don't work yourself so hard. Take a break after each song. You always play for the entire afternoon—don't your hands get tired?” he said with concern, placing a teapot and cup in front of Ye Yinzhu and pouring him a cup.\n\nThe tea was a pale blue, crystal clear in appearance. A faint, refreshing fragrance wafted from it, soothing the heart and mind.\n\n“Sula, what kind of tea is this today? It's different from usual.” Ye Yinzhu picked it up and took a sip. The tea was slightly bitter, but the bitterness was followed by a hint of sweetness that lingered pleasantly.\n\nSula's face flushed, but he assumed Ye Yinzhu didn't see it because his head was lowered. “This is Forget-me-not, a purely natural wildflower. It's a beverage offered as tribute to the imperial palace. It can nourish yin and the kidneys, enrich the blood, clear the heart and lungs, calm the liver and brighten the eyes, and preserve one's youthful appearance. Drink up, it's good for you anyway. This tea is one of the most expensive types. I secretly brewed it for you.”\n\n“Forget-me-not, forget me not… that's a really nice name. Sula, you're not afraid I'll forget you, are you? How could I? We're good brothers. But you have a great memory. You haven't been working here long, but you're almost a flower tea expert.” As he spoke, Ye Yinzhu took another sip and couldn't help but praise it again.\n\nSula pulled the gauze curtain shut and left with the tray, afraid that if he stayed any longer, Ye Yinzhu would see his beet-red face. Pressing a hand gently to his chest, feeling his own frantic heartbeat, Sula silently asked himself, *What's wrong with me? What possessed me to choose this kind of flower tea?*\n\nAfter finishing his cup of tea, Ye Yinzhu began his afternoon performance. It was still the Sea Moon Clear Brilliance Guqin. One after another, deep and moving melodies poured forth from his eight fingers. Those who had heard him play before felt something was strange; today's music seemed to have changed compared to the past. The sense of innocence seemed to have diminished, replaced by a touch of maturity. How could they know that this was the evolution from a Heart of Pure Innocence to a Heart of Sword-like Courage?\n\nYe Yinzhu played as he always did. Once he entered his own rhythm, the performance was impossible to stop, his entire being completely immersed in the music. The advancement of his Guqin Heart realm, coupled with the leap his state of mind had taken today under the stimulation of the ‘Continuous Pearls of the Flying Waterfall,’ made his music even more beautiful and engrossing.\n\nEven without a trace of magical power present, every guest outside listened, mesmerized. Not a single person spoke; only the occasional clinking of teacups could be heard. Whenever this happened, the person who made the noise would immediately be glared at by the others. The elegance of Piao Lan Xuan had, because of Ye Yinzhu's arrival, been invisibly elevated to another level.\n\n***\n¹Xiao San (小三), literally \"Little Three,\" is a nickname for the author, Tang Jia San Shao (唐家三少), whose name means \"Third Young Master of the Tang Family.\"",

    "content": "To my dear friends, please vote, add to your collection, and support Xiao San. Thank you.\n\n  —————————————————————\n\n  \"An Ya. Are you there?\" a soft voice, yet one that every person could hear clearly, suddenly rang out from the first floor of the Floating Orchid Pavilion.\n\n  The voice seemed to possess a special rhythm. When it sounded, Ye Yin Zhu suddenly felt his mind falter. The music from his zither came to an abrupt halt, and the piece \"Serene Orchid\" was thus interrupted.\n\n  When the patrons cast reproachful glances toward the first floor, none could utter a word of blame. The one who had disturbed the tranquil elegance was a woman, an exquisitely beautiful woman. She looked very much like An Ya; on the surface, her age was impossible to tell, for she possessed both a young girl's purity and a mature woman's charm. The set of her brow also bore a striking resemblance to An Ya. However, she possessed an air of authority that An Ya lacked. Perhaps her beauty was slightly inferior to An Ya's, but the nobility she exuded surpassed even An Ya's. Even though the patrons of the Floating Orchid Pavilion were all of noble birth, not one of them made a sound of complaint upon seeing her. They were all stunned by her nobility, beauty, and authority. A pale green gown outlined her exquisite figure. Most captivating of all were her pale green eyes, which, amidst their sublime nobility, held a trace of extreme, icy coldness.\n\n  As she spoke, the woman was already ascending the stairs. Some servers tried to stop her, but they were all blocked by an invisible force, unable to get close. When she reached the landing between the first and second floors, she paused, nodded slightly toward Ye Yin Zhu's position, and said apologetically, \"I'm so sorry for interrupting your performance. But I have urgent business with An Ya.\"\n\n  \"It's alright.\" Ye Yin Zhu rested his hands on the strings. Although the feeling of having his performance interrupted was unpleasant, he was broad-minded by nature. Since the other party had already apologized, he wouldn't dwell on it. Most of the patrons were hearing his voice for the first time, and many were surprised to discover that the mysterious zither master of the Floating Orchid Pavilion was so young.\n\n  An Ya's cold voice came from above. \"What are you doing here? You're not welcome. Leave.\" When Ye Yin Zhu had begun to play, she had already appeared at the top of the third-floor staircase, sitting there quietly, sipping her favorite Jade Beauty Tea while listening to Yin Zhu's zither music. For her, this was the most enjoyable moment of her day.\n\n  \"An Ya, is there truly no possibility of reconciliation between us?\" As she spoke, the woman continued her slow ascent, while An Ya began to descend from above. The two peerless beauties, whose overall merits were impossible to distinguish, gradually drew closer, their gazes locked. And the midpoint between them was precisely where Ye Yin Zhu was located.\n\n  \"Dida,\" An Ya called out suddenly.\n\n  \"My lady.\" Dida bowed from the first floor.\n\n  An Ya said lightly, \"Please have all the guests leave. Today's expenses are on me.\"\n\n  \"Yes, my lady,\" Dida replied respectfully and immediately began conveying An Ya's wishes to the guests with the other servers.\n\n  Everyone had naturally heard An Ya's words. No one voiced a complaint; one by one, they stood up, and although their expressions showed some reluctance, they all left.\n\n  Lao Ma, a daily regular, was the last to leave. He glanced at the woman facing An Ya from across Ye Yin Zhu's position and said, \"Miss An Ya, do you need any help?\"\n\n  An Ya's brow furrowed slightly. \"No need. Go.\"\n\n  Lao Ma sighed softly, gave An Ya a deep look, and shook his head with a hint of helplessness before turning to leave.\n\n  At this point, only Ye Yin Zhu, the servers, An Ya, and the other woman remained in the entire Floating Orchid Pavilion.\n\n  \"An Qi, what are you here for? There's nothing between us anymore. I came all the way to the Milan Empire, and you still won't leave me alone?\" An Ya's gaze grew even colder. Because they were so close, Ye Yin Zhu could see the expressions on both women's faces, even through the gauze curtain. At this moment, the usually gentle An Ya looked as if she were forcibly suppressing her rage, her entire body frighteningly cold.\n\n  An Qi turned and looked toward the giant, ancient tree. \"Is there really nothing between us? No matter what, we are blood sisters. That's a fact that can never be changed. Isn't it? My little sister.\"\n\n  \"Who's your sister? You're not worthy,\" An Ya snarled. An immense, invisible pressure erupted from her body.\n\n  Ye Yin Zhu had already advanced from the Pure Heart of the Zither to the Sword's Gall, Zither's Heart. He was also wearing the Moon God's Protection and, on his chest, the Mind's Guardian, which could keep him clear-headed amidst spiritual magic. But at this very moment, as An Ya suddenly unleashed her power in a fit of rage, the immense pressure left him unable to breathe. His body went completely rigid, as if all the life force within him had been completely locked down.\n\n  The space all around seemed to collapse under the tremendous pressure emanating from An Ya. The agony was simply indescribable. And what Ye Yin Zhu was enduring was merely the peripheral aura of this pressure.\n\n  An Qi seemed unaffected by the immense aura An Ya was projecting. A wave of pressure, in no way inferior to An Ya's, was released from her own body. She smiled faintly. \"Little sister, your strength has improved again. It seems leaving home hasn't affected your cultivation. You should know why I've come. Hand over that item, and I'll never bother you again.\"\n\n  Under the dual pressure from An Qi and An Ya, Ye Yin Zhu felt as if his body was about to shatter. Fortunately, the life-saving warm current appeared again at that moment, allowing him to barely remain standing. He couldn't help but wonder in horror, just what level of power did Sister An Ya possess? This was just the aura they were releasing!\n\n  \"In your dreams. An Qi, this is not the place to fight. Let's take this outside the city.\" An Ya's expression grew even uglier, her eyes filled with nothing but rage. But at that moment, she seemed to sense Ye Yin Zhu's suffering under their combined pressure and cast a worried glance toward the gauze curtain.\n\n  A glint flashed in An Qi's eyes. She smiled, \"Very well! Let's go.\" Her immense aura retracted abruptly. Suddenly, her body flickered like a phantom. Behind the gauze curtain, Ye Yin Zhu felt his whole body tighten; in that instant, both his Dou Qi and his magical power were completely sealed. Immediately after, a sensation like riding the clouds and mist left him disoriented. By the time his vision cleared to bright daylight, An Qi was already carrying him, flying out of the Floating Orchid Pavilion. That's right, flying. The Clear Brilliance of the Sea Moon slipped from his lap the moment he was grabbed. Luckily, it didn't fall off the platform, so it wasn't damaged.\n\n  \"Let him go! What's between us has nothing to do with him!\" An Ya's even more furious voice rang out from behind. She was flying too. Yes, also flying.\n\n  \"Yin Zhu—!\" Su La's cry of alarm faded into the distance. Everything visible around them was disappearing with the speed of lightning, like a fleeting dream.\n\n  Although Ye Yin Zhu couldn't move his body, his mind could still think. *Flying, why can they fly?* It seemed that even his two grandfathers were unable to fly after reaching the Purple Level. Qin Shang had once said that only wind-element mages could fly short distances using their own magic. Were they wind-element mages? Could magical flight be this fast?\n\n  At this moment, his heart was filled with questions, but not a single worry.\n\n  The surrounding scenery flashed by like lightning. Ye Yin Zhu couldn't see anything clearly; he could only smell the faint, pleasant fragrance on An Qi. The scent was very nice, seemingly a type of all-natural perfume, but the chilly aura she was currently emitting ruined much of the overall impression.",

Thank you.\n\n—————————————————————\n\nAlthough An Qi's strength was terrifying, her body felt very soft. It was just a shame that Ye Yinzhu’s current position was far from comfortable.\n\nBefore long, An Qi suddenly stopped, her figure making a beautiful turn in mid-air as she landed on the ground. They were surrounded by a forest. Ye Yinzhu was certain they were no longer within the city of Milan, but as for where exactly this was, he had no idea.\n\nAn Qi’s hand gripped Ye Yinzhu's shoulder. She looked at An Ya, who had drifted to the ground an instant after her, and said, \"Don't try anything, or I can't guarantee the safety of this little lover of yours.\"\n\n\"He's not my lover, just an employee I hired. Let him go,\" An Ya stated, her gaze fixed coldly on An Qi.\n\nAn Qi smiled faintly. \"Really? But when he was performing, I saw an unprecedented look of concentration on your face. Your eyes have already betrayed you.\"\n\nA sharp light flashed in An Ya's eyes. \"What nonsense are you spouting? How could he and I possibly...? Have you forgotten how old we are?\"\n\nAn Qi said, \"Of course I haven't forgotten, but while we may be old, in relative terms, we're only equivalent to humans in their thirties. We're still quite young. Even when your little lover dies of old age, we won't have changed much, will we?\"\n\n\"'We humans'? Are you not human?\" Ye Yinzhu asked, somewhat curious. Speaking was about all he could do right now.\n\nAn Qi's expression turned cold. Ignoring Ye Yinzhu, she said to An Ya, \"I'll give you one last chance. Hand over that item, and I'll return your little lover to you and never bother you again. Otherwise, I'll kill him first, then take it from you by force.\"\n\n\"No, I will never give you that item. You are not worthy,\" An Ya said hatefully. At that moment, as if recalling some painful memory, all the elegance vanished from her exquisite face, replaced by a coldness that seemed capable of freezing the air.\n\n\"Then, I'll just have to kill him.\" As she spoke, An Qi's hand gripping Ye Yinzhu's shoulder suddenly tightened. An almost irresistible force erupted wildly, a special energy that seemed to be both Dou Qi and magic, instantly surging into Ye Yinzhu's body as if to tear him to shreds.\n\n\"Don't!\" An Ya cried out in alarm, lunging forward as fast as lightning.\n\nAn Qi didn't actually want to kill Ye Yinzhu so quickly. She slightly eased the pressure and retreated rapidly with his body, dodging An Ya's charge.\n\nA scorching current of air spread from his limbs and bones. The intense pain in his shoulder seemed to be the source of this heat flow, which surged upwards with tremendous force. Ye Yinzhu cried out as his black eyes instantly turned deep purple. An Qi only felt her hand slip. Ye Yinzhu's shoulder had suddenly become incredibly hard and smooth. A resilient force burst from the Moon God's Guardian, mixing with a special aura that actually knocked her hand off his shoulder in an instant.\n\n\"Eh?\" An Qi cried out in surprise. Before she could react, An Ya had already charged with her full strength. Their hands met in an instant, and with a deafening roar, both were thrown backward. The unlucky Ye Yinzhu, who happened to be near the center of their collision, was sent flying by a powerful shockwave.\n\nLanding lightly, An Qi looked at her hand in confusion. She couldn't fathom how Ye Yinzhu had managed to escape her grasp.\n\nAs Ye Yinzhu was sent flying, the Moon God's Guardian finally unleashed its power under the direction of his liberated spiritual energy. He crashed through several large trees before his body came to a stop, but under the protection of the milky-white light it released, he was unharmed. Only his shoulder still throbbed with excruciating pain. In particular, the energy An Qi had sent into him earlier was still wreaking havoc inside his body. Fortunately, that strange surge of heat continued to well up, gradually dispelling the destructive force.\n\nHe subconsciously pulled back the Moon God's Guardian on his body to look at his shoulder and was amazed to find a layer of purple crystals had formed there. The color of the crystals was now gradually fading as they slowly merged into his body.\n\nThe moment An Ya was thrown back, she landed and, without the slightest pause—not even giving herself a moment to catch her breath—launched herself into the air again. Her body transformed into seven figures in mid-air, attacking An Qi from different directions. The light she released was a pure, violet glow. Purple Rank. That's right, An Ya was a Purple Rank powerhouse. And the violet of her aura was incredibly deep.\n\nAn Qi snorted. \"And you say he's not your little lover? Fighting so desperately, aren't you just afraid I'll hurt him? Whatever you don't want me to do is exactly what I will do.\" She made a small circle with her hands in front of her chest, and a mass of viscous, violet liquid swirled before her. The violet element she released was nearly as deep in color as An Ya's, showing their strengths were comparable.\n\nIf Ferguson were here at this moment, he would have been shocked to discover that these two exquisitely beautiful and young-looking women both possessed the power of the Purple Rank, Eighth Order. That's right, Purple Rank, Eighth Order.\n\n\"Yinzhu.\" From the depths of his soul, a faint pull resonated at that moment. Ye Yinzhu clearly felt his body being pulled away by something, as if yanked by an invisible force. Everything before his eyes blurred, and his surroundings turned into a white void. It felt as if countless streams of light and shadow were flowing past him.\n\nIn the instant before their energies collided, An Ya and An Qi both witnessed a strange scene. Ye Yinzhu, who had been thrown far into the distance, saw his body gradually fade until it vanished completely.\n\nWhen his surroundings came into focus again, he found himself in a strange place. The air was cold, much colder than where he had just been. There was no forest, only a barren, hilly landscape. He could even see patches of lingering snow on the distant ground. He was standing on a small hillock, and there was someone else here—a person both familiar and dear to Ye Yinzhu.\n\n\"Zi, where am I?\" Ye Yinzhu asked, his voice filled with pleasant surprise. The discomfort from the spatial shift had vanished.\n\nZi looked at Ye Yinzhu, his deep, calm eyes holding a hint of reproach. \"This is the Far North Wasteland. Yinzhu, why don't you summon me when you're in danger? It was the same yesterday, and again today. Do you still consider me your brother?\"\n\nYe Yinzhu now understood completely. It was Zi who had sensed his danger through their Equal Life Contract and summoned him here. What he didn't know was how fortunate this was. Back there, a battle between two peak Purple Rank, Eighth Order powerhouses was unfolding. The shockwaves alone would have been enough to grievously injure him. Even if he hadn't been killed, he would have been severely wounded, especially since An Qi had already made him her target.\n\n\"That's not it, Zi. Of course we're brothers. Yesterday, I didn't summon you because I was confident I could handle the danger. And just now… everything happened so fast, I didn't even have time to think…\" As he said this, Ye Yinzhu scratched his head sheepishly.\n\nZi sighed helplessly. \"Yinzhu, you must remember. No matter when, if you are in danger, you must summon me at the first possible moment. Don't have any reservations. It's a good thing you weren't in the middle of a fight this time. Otherwise, even if I wanted to summon you to save you, it would have been impossible.\"\n\n\"Zi, let's not talk about that for now. I can stay here for at least an hour, right? I prepared a gift for you today. I was actually planning to summon you to my side tonight to give it to you.\"",

    "content": "To my dear readers, please vote, add this to your collection, and support Xiao San. Thank you.\n\n—————————————————\n\nZi’s brow furrowed slightly. \"A gift? I don't need a gift.\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu smiled. \"Although I don't know if you can use it, I have a feeling you're going to love this gift. But, you'd better be careful, it's huge.\" As he spoke, he raised his left hand, which wore the spatial ring. With a flash of light, an incomparably massive, dark-blue brilliance instantly appeared before the two of them.\n\nThe massive object began to topple over. Just as Ye Yin Zhu cried out in alarm, Zi stepped forward and, with his own two hands, caught the falling object with sheer force, slowly lowering it to the ground.\n\nZi’s gaze was now fixed upon it. What Ye Yin Zhu had summoned from his spatial ring was a sword: the very same Amethyst Greatsword he had acquired from the treasury of the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy.\n\nYe Yin Zhu's jaw dropped in astonishment. He had always known Zi was strong, but he had never imagined that Zi could actually catch the sword with his bare hands and lower it steadily to the ground. Although it looked like a struggle, he had still done it. When Ye Yin Zhu had stored the sword, he had tried to move it himself, but even with his full Dou Qi, he hadn't been able to make the sword budge in the slightest.\n\n\"Amethyst... It's really Amethyst,\" Zi's voice was thick with emotion. He slowly caressed the blade of the Amethyst Greatsword, and his eyes, usually so resolute, now shimmered with tears. His body even began to tremble slightly.\n\n\"Zi, are you okay? It's a pity it's so enormous. I remember you wanted to buy a greatsword last time.\" At this, Ye Yin Zhu couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed. The Amethyst was certainly a greatsword, but this was a bit *too* great. Although Zi was considered tall among humans, he looked tiny in front of the Amethyst Greatsword; the palm of his hand wasn't even large enough to grip its massive hilt.\n\n\"Yin Zhu, thank you.\" Zi stood up. When he turned to face Ye Yin Zhu, Yin Zhu was astonished to discover two streams of tears running down Zi's face.\n\nZi was crying. Zi was actually crying over a sword.\n\n\"Zi, what's the matter?\"\n\nZi shook his head, a rare smile gracing his usually icy features. \"I'm just overjoyed. Yin Zhu, this sword is very important to me. Really, truly important. Can you tell me how you obtained it?\"\n\nYe Yin Zhu nodded. \"Of course. I won the new student tournament at the Milan Magic and Martial Arts Academy, and this was one of my prizes. When I saw it in the treasury, I thought it was very unusual. Especially when I touched the blade, I could feel its majesty and a strange sense of affinity. The patterns on it changed at that moment, revealing the word 'Amethyst' to me. But no one else could sense any of that. For some reason, seeing it made me think of you, so I chose it as a gift. The only problem is, I only have one spatial ring, which was a gift from Sister Anya. How are you going to carry a sword this big!\"\n\nZi laughed. This time, he threw his head back and roared with laughter, as if releasing all his pent-up emotions in that single moment. He shouted at the sky with a hint of wildness, \"Fate! It must be fate that brought the Amethyst Sword to me! Yin Zhu, do you know why you felt that sense of affinity when you touched it? It's because you carry my aura. Our Equal Life Contract has given you a portion of my power.\"\n\nA look of realization dawned on Ye Yin Zhu. \"So, you're saying my recent surge in strength, and that layer of purple crystal that just appeared on my shoulder... that all comes from your power? Zi, can you tell me the history of this sword? I know you have a lot of secrets. Of course, if it's not convenient to talk about, then never mind.\"\n\nZi shook his head. \"Those changes in you are indeed because of our contract. Similarly, I've also gained considerable benefits from you. The power I can give you is in defense and strength. It's better for you not to know certain things right now. I can only tell you this: this Amethyst Sword is an ancestral heirloom of mine. It has been lost for many years. By finding it and returning it to me, you are my benefactor. And...\" He paused, gripping Ye Yin Zhu's shoulder and saying with a solemn expression, \"Yin Zhu, I know you have many questions you want to ask me. When you enter the Violet Rank, I will tell you everything. For now, all you need to know is that I am your brother, your eternal brother. That is enough.\"\n\nIn the end, Zi still did not speak of the Amethyst's origins, and Ye Yin Zhu did not ask again. Zi’s excitement at receiving the Amethyst Greatsword was satisfaction enough for him, just as it had been when he watched Sura obtain the Eternal Substitute Puppet and the Angel’s Sigh.\n\nZi strode over to the edge of the Amethyst Greatsword, held out his right hand, and sliced his palm forcefully across the blade. Blood instantly began to flow. Zi's gaze was utterly scorching, as if he felt no pain at all. He placed his bleeding hand on the greatsword's patterns and, starting from the beginning of the design, slowly traced the lines in order, letting his blood completely coat the engravings.\n\nYe Yin Zhu could see clearly that the blood flowing from Zi's hand was a faint purple.\n\n\"Zi, you're going to bleed out!\"\n\n\"I'll be fine.\" Zi continued what he was doing. His gaze was resolute, his usual iciness completely replaced by a fiery intensity as he looked at the Amethyst Greatsword.\n\nThe Amethyst Greatsword was simply enormous, and Zi was incredibly meticulous as he smeared his blood, not missing a single groove in the pattern. His pale purple blood, upon seeping into the lines on the blade, was instantly absorbed. The Amethyst Greatsword began to transform from its original dark blue. A brilliant purple light started to emanate from the blade, and the domineering aura Ye Yin Zhu had felt before returned, even more pronounced this time.\n\nAs the blood flowed, Zi's face grew increasingly pale, but his expression was one of intense concentration. Ye Yin Zhu tried to stop him several times, but Zi refused him each time.\n\nWhen the last of the patterns was coated with the pale purple blood, the Amethyst Greatsword finally revealed its true appearance. The enormous blade looked as if it had been carved from a single block of amethyst, its translucent purple light suffused with immense killing intent and an intense, tyrannical aura. The purple light swirled under the sun's rays. At that moment, though it was merely lying on the ground, it felt like the center of the world.\n\nZi looked very weak; it was the first time Ye Yin Zhu had ever seen him in such a state. As he straightened up, he even staggered, only managing to stay on his feet with Ye Yin Zhu's help. And yet, Ye Yin Zhu saw in his eyes a dazzling light that completely contradicted his physical condition.\n\nA low incantation began to issue from Zi's lips. The language was strange, its tone deep and resonant, unlike any language Ye Yin Zhu recognized. It sounded unique. The rhythmic cadence of Zi's voice was harmonious and melodic. A soft purple light emanated from his body, drifting over to the Amethyst Greatsword and connecting them like a bridge, allowing them to communicate.\n\nAs Zi's chanting grew more rapid, the purple light emanating from him grew more intense. A bizarre scene unfolded: the Amethyst Greatsword, once incomparably heavy and solid, began to blur. It dissolved into a mass of energy that was suddenly released, and through the bridge of light connecting them, it began to merge into Zi's body.",
