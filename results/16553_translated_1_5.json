Don't forget to add this book to your collection!\n\n***\n\nAs the weakest kingdom on the entire Longinus Continent, Arcadia’s territory was undoubtedly the smallest. Located in the southeastern tip of the continent, it was bordered on the southeast by the vast and boundless ocean, while its other two sides were encircled by two powerful empires. If not for the interference from a place called Falan, located in the center of the continent, a country like Arcadia would likely have long since perished. And our story begins in Luna City, the capital of Arcadia.\n\nThe blazing sun was like fire, especially in the south of the Longinus Continent, where the sun in the sky seemed close at hand, bringing scorching hot air. Everyone bathed in the sunlight felt as though their bodies had turned into hot coals, ceaselessly dripping with sweat. Though it was still morning, the streets of Luna City were filled with languid figures. No wonder some said that the two powerful empires, Landias and Boron, hadn’t partitioned Arcadia not only due to Falan’s interference but also because this was truly the hottest furnace on the entire continent.\n\nOf course, there were exceptions. At this moment, in front of Luna City’s Magic Guild, a hale and hearty old man arrived.\n\nHis white magic robe was without a single wrinkle, as upright as he himself was. Dense wrinkles revealed the old man’s age, and his silver-white long hair was neatly combed back. The old mage was very tall, at least half a head taller than ordinary Arcadians. In his right hand, also covered with wrinkles, he held a long, slender staff. Although the staff was currently propped on the ground, no one would ever think he relied on this pure wooden staff to support his body. That was because of his eyes—the old mage’s eyes. A pair of black eyes as clear as an abyss, yet incredibly limpid. The old mage squinted slightly, but a faint sparkle would still inadvertently flash between his opening and closing eyelids.\n\n\"Praise Falan, greetings, respected Mage, may I help you with anything?\" As Pirlo stepped out of the Magic Guild, he saw this old mage. Although the old mage wore no valuable attire or magic items, and his rank couldn’t be discerned from his magic robe or the lack of elemental fluctuations around him, as a Yellow-level Intermediate Mage who had cultivated in Luna City’s Magic Guild for over twenty years, he trusted his instincts. Only those who sought to show off would display their magic rank on their magic robes, and how could an old mage who looked at least seventy be a low-level mage? What’s more, there wasn’t a single drop of sweat on his wrinkled forehead.\n\n\"Praise Falan.\" The old mage’s voice was very gentle and pleasant, though a little low, yet it gave one the feeling of being bathed in a spring breeze; even the scorching air seemed to cool down a few degrees. \"I come from Falan. Please take me to see the acting Guild Master.\"\n\nPirlo’s body stiffened abruptly, and his sparkling eyes filled with surprise and wild joy. From Falan? He was from Falan. On the Longinus Continent, even the most common commoner would understand the meaning of that phrase. The Master of Luna City’s Magic Guild had passed away over two years ago. As the main Magic Guild of the Kingdom of Arcadia, the position of Master had been vacant for more than two years. He came from Falan, could it be…\n\nWhat was the most esteemed profession on the Longinus Continent? It was a Mage. Perhaps some would disbelieve in the existence of gods, but no one failed to revere Mages. Falan was a flat expanse of land on the Longinus Continent. Its area was roughly half the size of the Kingdom of Arcadia. Though its land was fertile, no country dared to covet it, because it was the holy land of Mages. Falan was the object of faith for almost all countries outside the far northern barren plains of the Longinus Continent.\n\nFalan was both the holy land of Mages and the place Mages feared most. Besides the Falan Legion guarding Falan, only Mages could enter here. Entering Falan was not too difficult, but wanting to leave Falan was something almost all Mages dared not hope for. Without Blue-level strength or higher, one would not be permitted to leave there.\n\nThe ranks of Mages, from lowest to highest, were Mage, Intermediate Mage, Advanced Mage, Grand Mage, Magus, Archmage, and Grand Archmage. Regardless of the type of magic, they all shared the same colors, graded by the colors of the rainbow. The lowest-level Mage corresponded to the first color of the rainbow, red, and so on. Blue represented an Archmage. The first six rainbow colors were divided into Primary, Intermediate, and Advanced tiers. A Yellow-level Intermediate Mage like Pirlo was an Intermediate-level Advanced Mage. As for the last color of the rainbow, purple, it was divided into nine tiers; even among Purple-level Grand Archmages, the difference in strength between different tiers was undoubtedly enormous. Falan became the holy land of Mages for another reason: within Falan, there were a total of seven Mage Towers, and within each Mage Tower resided a powerful nine-tier Purple-level Mage, who were the apex existences on Longinus.\n\nTherefore, on the Longinus Continent, it was very easy to discern a person’s strength. Any magic or Battle Qi was distinguished by color; the color displayed upon release could fully reveal the wielder's own strength.\n\n\"Please, you, please.\" Pirlo respectfully moved aside.\n\nA faint smile appeared on the old mage's face. He nodded slightly to Pirlo, then followed him into the Magic Guild.\n\nInside the Guild Hall, vast magical elements permeated the air. A Magic Hexagram inlaid with mithril on the floor emitted a faint silver glow. The interior of the Guild seemed spacious, which had much to do with the sparse number of Mages. In a small kingdom like Arcadia, the number of Mages could only be described as deserted. Therefore, though the Guild held a high position in the kingdom, it remained desolate.\n\nPirlo did not make the old mage wait long. In a moment, another elderly mage had been invited out from inside the Guild. This mage wore a cyan magic robe and looked to be about the same age as the visiting old mage.\n\n\"Praise Falan, greetings, Mage from afar. I am Diara, the acting Master of the Kingdom of Arcadia’s Magic Guild, a Fire Mage.\" As he spoke, Diara slowly bowed to the white-robed old mage. At the same time, a faint cyan flame erupted from his right hand, displaying his exact rank as a Cyan-level Primary Mage. This was the highest form of etiquette for a Mage. One must know that given Diara’s status in Arcadia, he wouldn’t need to do this even when meeting the King. The reason for his deference was simple: the white-robed Mage before him came from Falan.\n\n\"Praise Falan, my name is Qin Shang. I come from Falan, and this is Falan’s letter.\" Qin Shang transferred the wooden staff in his hand to his left hand, extending his right hand flat towards Diara. A faint light flashed, and a parchment scroll appeared in his palm.\n\nBoth Pirlo and Diara were stunned by the scene before them, because they clearly saw that although the light in Qin Shang’s hand was very faint, its color was—purple.\n\nDiara’s hands trembled slightly as he took the parchment scroll and slowly unfurled it. There was nothing on the parchment scroll, just a blank sheet, but Diara was not surprised. His gaze instinctively turned to Qin Shang before him.",

    "content": "Qin Shang's right hand swept across, and another faint purple light covered the parchment scroll. Immediately, surrounded by the purple light, a line of text appeared. Diara read aloud, a little agitated, \"By decree, Violet-level Tier 1 Divine Musician Qin Shang, to assume the position of Arcadian Mage Guild President. Ah, you're a Divine Musician?\" This time, Diara and Pirro's surprise had turned into shock.\n\nDivine Musicians, as a branch of mental mages, are mages who cast spells through musical instrument performance. They could be said to be the most prestigious among the mages on the continent, but also the most impractical.^1 Because Divine Musicians find it difficult to cultivate beyond the Yellow-level; at most, they can only serve to slightly boost morale on the battlefield. For a long time, only daughters of great nobles or princesses from various countries would be interested in learning this prestigious but impractical magic. Yet, the old mage before them was actually a Divine Musician, a Violet-level Divine Musician. Diara truly couldn't believe his eyes. However, the ancient symbol surrounded by a silver hexagram in the lower right corner of the scroll represented the Illusion Tower among Falan's Seven Towers. Clearly, this mage named Qin Shang had arrived here after passing the Illusion Tower's test. And the purple magic energy he released was so real.\n\nA reminiscent expression appeared on Qin Shang's aged face. He turned slightly towards the northwest; everything he experienced in the Illusion Tower was unforgettable. That was true magic!\n\nDiara quickly regained his composure; Falan's official decree could not be faked. He hastily and respectfully rolled up the parchment scroll and presented it to Qin Shang. \"Diara, along with Pirro, greets the Guild President.\"\n\nQin Shang took back the scroll and said, \"How many mages does Arcadian currently have?\"\n\nHearing Qin Shang's question, Diara couldn't help but reveal a bitter expression. \"Arcadian, including myself, has one Azure-level mage, three Green-level mages, twenty-four Yellow-level mages, sixty-seven Orange-level mages, and two hundred thirteen Red-level mages. Most have joined the army; only a dozen or so remain in the Guild.\"\n\nA faint trace of surprise appeared on Qin Shang's face. \"So few? Although magic cultivation is a long process, with Arcadian's tens of millions of people, are there really only three hundred mages? I recall that mages in other countries don't seem to be so scarce!\"\n\nDiara sighed and said, \"It certainly wasn't this few before. Our Arcadian Kingdom has always been known for producing fire mages. But now, the nation's power is steadily weakening. Mages with some strength have all gone to the two surrounding great empires. Those willing to stay, naturally... However, it's good that you've come this time. You are a Violet-level Grand Mage! Arcadian hasn't seen a Violet-level powerhouse appear for hundreds of years. I believe our Arcadian Mage Guild will certainly grow strong under your leadership.\" Although he was no longer young, he couldn't help but grow excited as he spoke. His gaze at Qin Shang was even somewhat fervent.\n\nJust then, a pleasant and elegant voice sounded from outside. \"Is Master Diara in?\"\n\nDiara paused, a smile appearing on his face, and apologizing to Qin Shang beside him, he went out to greet her. A moment later, a young woman followed Diara into the hall.\n\nThe woman was extremely beautiful, with long black hair, a fair complexion, and a long emerald-green dress. Her face appeared slightly full, but this did not detract from her noble demeanor. Whether walking or standing, she gave the impression of being perfectly upright, as if her slender waist could never bend. At this moment, she held a swaddling cloth in her arms; even breathing sounds came from within, and the infant inside seemed to be fast asleep.\n\nSeeing this woman, Qin Shang's eyes lit up. His slightly narrowed eyes slowly opened, sparkling with a sharp glint.\n\nThe woman immediately felt his piercing gaze. Her delicate brows furrowed slightly, and a faint azure light flashed in her eyes as she looked towards Qin Shang. The moment their gazes met, the light in the woman's eyes instantly blurred for a moment. When she returned to normal, her expression changed dramatically, and she subconsciously clutched the swaddling cloth in her arms tighter.\n\nDiara's mind was still somewhat muddled, so he didn't notice this. He said to the woman, \"Meiying, where's Ye Chong? Why didn't he come with you? You seem to have just finished your confinement, right?\"^2\n\nMeiying subconsciously shifted half a step sideways and smiled, \"Oh, him? He's been diligently training Dou Qi lately, so I came alone. Master, our child is already one month old. We'll have to trouble you to bless him.\" A mage's blessing is the best protection for a newborn. The higher the level of the mage, the healthier the blessed newborn will be, without restrictions on magical attributes.\n\nDiara chuckled, readily agreeing, \"No problem, didn't I say long ago that after your child is born, I would certainly bless him? Oh, right, let me introduce you. This is the Guild's new President, Master Qin Shang from Falan.\" Although he had met an acquaintance, he hadn't forgotten the new President standing nearby.\n\nMeiying seemed not to have forgotten Qin Shang's earlier gaze at her. She merely offered a faint bow and said, \"Praise Falan, hello, Master.\"\n\nQin Shang was about to speak when a clear baby's cry came from the swaddling cloth. A pair of white, lotus root-like arms reached out from the swaddling cloth, gently waving, as if trying to break free from its mother's embrace.\n\nThe words on Qin Shang's lips abruptly halted, because he saw the infant's small hands in Meiying's arms: those soft, white little hands each had only four fingers, missing the pinky fingers on both left and right hands. From the moment he appeared at the Mage Guild until now, his expression had undergone a significant fluctuation for the first time, and the degree of this fluctuation startled everyone present.\n\nWith a quick stride, Qin Shang was already in front of Meiying, his aged face flushed with excitement. He raised his trembling hands, reaching for those small hands, tender as spring onions and shimmering with a crystalline milky-white luster. His swift movements made him look less like a mage and more like a warrior.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Meiying snapped in a low voice, strangely taking two steps backward consecutively. Although Qin Shang's speed was not slow, what he touched was only an afterimage.\n\nHe didn't pursue. Qin Shang's gaze remained fixed on those delicate, pink little hands. He stood there dazed, even forgetting to lower the hands he had just raised. \"Eight fingers, born with eight fingers! Someone truly born with eight fingers! A genius, this is absolutely a genius!\"\n\nDiara was startled by the scene before him. He hastily stepped forward, blocking between Meiying and Qin Shang, and anxiously said, \"Don't misunderstand, don't misunderstand, Master Qin Shang, you, what is this...?\"\n\nQin Shang was, after all, a Grand Mage who had recently advanced. The expression on his face slowly calmed. He lowered his head, staring at the mithril-inlaid magic hexagram on the floor. After a long moment of contemplation, a gleam of ecstatic joy appeared in his eyes. He clapped his hands together once, as happy as a child. \"Praise Falan, good, just like that.\"\n\nHe raised his head and looked at Meiying's wary yet curious gaze, smiling slightly. It had to be admitted that, despite his wrinkled face, his refined attire and demeanor were quite elegant. \"Miss Meiying, you came today to have your child blessed with magic, didn't you?\"\n\nMeiying subconsciously nodded.\n\nQin Shang's gaze turned to Diara beside him. \"In that case, let me bestow the blessing upon this child.\"\n\n---\n^1 The original Chinese term \"雞肋\" (jīlèi), literally \"chicken ribs,\" refers to something that isn't particularly useful or enjoyable, but one is reluctant to discard it because it still has some value, or it's not worth the effort to get rid of. In this context, it implies high status but low practical combat utility. \"Impractical\" conveys the meaning well.\n^2 \"Finished your confinement\": The original \"出了月子\" (chū le yuèzi) refers to the traditional postpartum confinement period, typically lasting a month, during which new mothers rest and recover.",

    "content": "Diala was stunned. One must know that in this world, for a one-month-old infant to receive a Magician's blessing was already exceedingly rare, let alone one performed by a Purple-Rank Grand Magus. Only the princes and princesses of great nations might have such a privilege!\n\n\"This...\" Diala looked at Mei Ying. At sixty-seven this year, he naturally saw the change in Qin Shang's expression after seeing Mei Ying's child, so he couldn't help but hesitate. Given his relationship with Mei Ying and her husband, how could he explain it if their child were harmed here?\n\nA faint chill appeared in Mei Ying's eyes, making the inherent arrogance in her bones even more apparent. \"Your Excellency, Guild Master, I want to know why.\"\n\nThe calmness in Qin Shang's eyes had completely vanished the moment he saw those small hands. A deep emotion appeared in his eyes, and even his voice gained a magnetic quality. \"Because of his hands. These are the most perfect pair of hands I've ever seen in this world. Madam Mei Ying, I mean no harm.\"\n\nThe chill Mei Ying displayed gradually disappeared. Indeed, although the Archmage Qin Shang before her had eyes full of fervent light, the aura emanating from him showed no malice at all; instead, it was filled with a sense of intimacy. However, upon hearing Qin Shang mention her son's hands, her expression couldn't help but turn exceptionally ugly. \"Master Qin Shang, why do you say my child's hands are the most perfect in the world? Are you satirizing me?\"\n\nA person's two hands each have five fingers. For a warrior, every single finger is extremely important. Although the child in Mei Ying's arms had only lost his left and right pinky fingers, it had a tremendous impact on gripping weapons. He couldn't even grip a longsword firmly. What parent doesn't hope for their child to be perfect? Mei Ying was no exception. However, while everything else about the child was fine, these congenital eight fingers had once broken her heart. Eight fingers had already determined that her child could not become a Sword Master, yet that was the entire family's expectation!\n\n\"Oh, no, no, praise Farland! I swear in Farland's name, I absolutely did not mean to satirize you in any way.\" Qin Shang's eyes, filled with emotion, watched the still struggling, crying infant. The lines on his face were unusually soft. \"Perhaps, to others, these hands are incomplete. But to someone like me, they are absolutely perfect. Wait a moment, and you will understand.\"\n\nUnder the gaze of Mei Ying, Diala, and Pierrot, Qin Shang slowly sat cross-legged. A flash of light appeared on his right hand. Mei Ying vaguely saw that it was a ring on Qin Shang's right pinky finger—a Spatial Ring, one of the most important magic artifacts for a magician.\n\nA reddish-brown guqin quietly appeared, resting flat on his lap. Its seven strings shimmered with a faint silver light. Qin Shang placed his hands on the strings, and his expression had undergone an earth-shattering change.\n\nHis aged face became serene and humble. His entire being was filled with the aura of life, as if, since ancient times, he had always sat there, maintaining that posture—white robes, silver hair, an ancient guqin. The moment his hands touched the strings, his entire person seemed to merge completely with everything in the Magicians' Guild hall. Unconsciously, everyone's gaze converged upon him.\n\nHis left hand hovered, pressing above the strings on the guqin's body, not touching the instrument itself. His right thumb and index finger slightly curled, middle and ring fingers lightly pressed on the fifth string. The thumb released, and the index finger lightly plucked the seventh string in mid-air, drawing forth a resonant, humming clear note. Within the clear note, deep and rich, the lingering melody lingered. In that instant, the air seemed to solidify, and the infant's cries quietly ceased.\n\nFrom within the swaddling clothes, a pair of dark, shining large eyes looked towards the source of the sound, and a few soft coos escaped his lips.\n\nWhether it was a High Magician like Pierrot, a Magus like Diala, or a warrior like Mei Ying, after hearing that clear sound, it felt as if all impurities within their bodies had been instantly purged. Their minds and bodies felt an unprecedented clarity, their blood circulated freely, and they felt an ineffable comfort.\n\n\"Withered Wood Dragon's Roar, you are...\" The hidden hostility in Mei Ying's eyes vanished instantly. She looked at Qin Shang, revealing a mixture of surprise and joy.\n\nQin Shang didn't reply, only smiled faintly. His hands moved simultaneously, his left hand gently pressing, his right subtly plucking. A moving melody floated forth. The guqin's sound was delicate and subtle, his fingerwork subtly controlling the nuances of light, slow, urgent, and heavy. The lighthearted rhythm carried a revolving, lingering charm, a kind of recitation that went straight to the heart. Faint purple light quietly emanated from the silver strings with the rhythm of his hands. Circles of pale purple halo enveloped the hall but did not spread.\n\nMagicians' spiritual power was undoubtedly much stronger than that of ordinary people. However, Pierrot and Diala had both already lost themselves in the soul-stirring guqin melody, their eyes filled with joy and bewilderment, completely forgetting where they were.\n\nMei Ying was the only one awake. She didn't know why she, whose spiritual power was far inferior to a magician's, remained conscious. She clearly saw the faint purple light converging in one direction, and that direction was precisely the swaddling clothes in her arms.\n\nThe infant had long since stopped crying. When Mei Ying looked down at her precious baby, she was surprised to find that, at some point, her son was smiling. His little hands, each with only four fingers, were gently waving in the air. Amidst the delicate and subtle guqin music, the sequence of his hand movements actually corresponded with the melody, and the faint purple light was quietly entering his body, causing him to undergo some peculiar changes.\n\nWas this real? Mei Ying felt as if she had transcended into another world, and she still hadn't fully recovered even after the guqin melody quietly ended.\n\n\"The brocade scarf twists and turns, the wine cup drips. The strings loosen, adjusting the precious pegs; the sheng chokes, burning the silver pipes. Playing 'Green Waters' on the Spring Thunder Guqin is most suitable for cleansing this child's body and mind.\" Qin Shang's voice pulled Mei Ying back from her dream-like state. Looking up, she saw a captivating silver light flashing in Qin Shang's eyes. The guqin that had been on his lap was gone. Looking at her precious baby in her arms, he was already asleep, his even breathing so melodious. The baby's skin seemed to have become even more lustrous and radiant, and a sweet smile graced his beautiful little face.\n\n\"A genius! He's an absolute genius! My judgment was not mistaken. Even though he's just a one-month-old infant, he can still perceive the true beauty in my guqin music. I truly envy your Bamboo Sect! Why isn't he with me? Now you should understand why I praised his perfect little hands. For a guqin player, the pinky fingers of both hands are 'forbidden fingers'; they serve no purpose whatsoever. When learning the guqin later in life, extra pinky fingers can even cause some interference. As a Divine Sound Master, I know too much about these things. There was once a legend about a person with six fingers on each hand, called the 'Six-Fingered Guqin Demon'—that was pure fabrication. For playing the guqin, eight fingers are perfectly sufficient. How perfect it is to be born with eight fingers!\" Qin Shang exclaimed with some emotion.\n\n\"Master, just who are you...?\" Mei Ying asked tentatively, the arrogance in her words already gone. It wasn't because of the purple light emanating from him, but because of the previous song 'Green Waters,' and because of the Withered Wood Dragon's Roar.\n\nQin Shang said, \"I come from Farland. If not for the Azure Sea, why would I be here? I originally intended to find a disciple to inherit my mantle, but I never expected the genius I favored would be from your Bamboo Sect. Come, take me to your father-in-law. Ye Li, Ye Li, it's been decades since we last met. I wonder if your body is still robust.\"\n\nMei Ying suddenly awakened. \"Your surname is Qin, Withered Wood Dragon's Roar... You're from the Zither Sect's...\"",

This time I really want to have a good conversation with Lao Yeluo.\"\n\n\n\nMei Ying looked at Pirlo and Diyala on the side and asked quietly, \"Master, what should they do?\"\n\n\n\nQin Man coughed lightly, and a purple air flashed in his eyes. The two of Diyala, who were immersed in confusion, woke up and raised their breath. Diyala praised, \"It's so wonderful, it's so wonderful, praise Meiya Blue. This is the first time I know the power of the Divine Singer. President, I'll ask you more in the future.\"\n\n\n\nQin Duo shook his head and said, \"What you feel is the power of spiritual magic, and you don't know how to appreciate the rhythm. The difference between the spiritual system and the elemental system is still too big.\" As he said, he used his body to hold the visual lines of Diyala and Pirlo, and winked at Meiying.\n\n\n\nMei Ying agreed, \"I thank Master Qin Shi for giving magic blessings to my little brother. If Master has time, I would like to ask Master to visit the Blue Sky Sea, so that my husband and I can share the same relationship with the landlords. How about it?\"\n\n\n\nQin Dui pointed at the head and said, \"Then I'm not polite.\"\n\n\n\nDiyala said in surprise: \"I like Mei French Blue and Mei Ying, I don't seem to have received such treatment!\"\n\n\n\nMei Ying smiled and said, \"There will be a chance in the future. Master Qin Man, please.\"\n\n\n\n  …\n\n\n\nThe blue sky sea means the meaning of the ocean in the green. Isn’t bamboo the hollow of the green? Therefore, this blue sky sea refers to a dense and prosperous bamboo forest.\n\n\n\nThe location of Blue Sky Sea is thirty kilometers west of Luna City. Various green bamboos form a different landscape. The faint light flashes between them. Even if it is a green soft light, each green bamboo stands so proudly.\n\n\n\nFor the Arcadians, the Blue Sky Sea is a strange place, with a large number of fresh bamboo shoots produced here, but no one has ever been able to penetrate deep into the Blue Sky Sea. No one knows how wide the Blue Sky Sea is, which borders the Kingdom of Arcadia and the Kingdom of Arcadias in the west. After entering the blue sky, every person who enters the blue sky will inexplicably walk out from the place they enter. No one knows why this is. Apart from the bamboo forest, there are no other rich specialties, so no one pays attention to it or interferes with it.The temperature in the Blue Sky Sea is very different from that in Luna City, or perhaps because there are a lot of green bamboos here. As soon as you enter the Blue Sky Sea, the heat in the air will naturally dissipate a lot.\n\n\n\nMei Yingqing walked in the bamboo sea with Aizi and Qin Man in her arms, and praised her, \"You have such a good physical strength. After walking such a far path, I didn't show any fatigue at all. This is the first time I have seen a magician like you.\"\n\n\n\nThirty miles are naturally not a big deal for a warrior, but for a magician, it is a long way away. If you look carefully, you can find that there is a faint air flow around Mei Ying's swaddle. It is Mei Ying's fighting spirit, protecting her baby son to avoid being affected by the heat in the air.\n\n\n\nQin Man smiled bitterly, \"Did you hear that sentence? None of the use is divine sound. As a divine sound master, I don't have the acceleration technique that elemental magicians can perform, and I don't want to have anything to go. No matter where I go to the mainland, I need to rely on my two legs. Over time, I will naturally be able to walk a little farther than ordinary people, and my physical strength is stronger than other magicians.\"\n\n\n\nWhile talking, Qin Meng discovered that the bamboo forest in front seemed to be a little illusory, and a kind smile appeared on his face. He broke a bamboo branch from his body with his hands, walked forward, and knocked on the bamboo on his body. His tapping speed was fast and slow, creating a special sound wave, and without allowing Mei Ying to lead the way, he walked directly into the depths of the bamboo forest. For ordinary people, how can they stop the blue sky sea, which is never crossed by ordinary people?\n\n\n\nMei Ying seemed to have guessed it a long time ago, and was not surprised. The steps under her feet became a little illusory, and she followed Qin Duo slowly and walked into the depths of the bamboo forest.\n\n\n\nThe blue sky sea is close to the center, and a row of whole bamboo houses are surrounded by a group of bamboos, ten of which are large and elegant. Before Mei Ying and Qin Dui arrived at the bamboo house, an old voice had already been sent out from one of the bamboo houses, \"Ying, why did you bring outsiders? Can't you remember what I said to you?\"\n\n\n\nBefore Mei Ying opened her mouth, Qin Dui smiled and said, \"Okay, your leaves are gone, will you even see old friends?\"\n\n\n\nThe bamboo house in the middle opened, and a flash-like figure arrived in front of Mei Ying and Qin Dui in an instant. Although the movement is extremely fast, it is like a cloud of water, without giving anyone any sudden feeling.\n\n\n\nYe Wei's figure is a bit taller than Qin Feng's. His gray-white hair is scattered behind him, and the folds on his face are obviously much less than Qin Feng's. He looks like he is over fifty years old, his waist is straight and his shiny eyes are filled with a few breaths. The mature man's feeling of slander is revealed in him. As soon as he saw Qin Wu, his big and thick hands immediately grabbed him. Qin Wu did not hide and allowed his hands to grab his shoulders.\n\n\n\n\"My husband, why are you here? We haven't seen it for more than 20 years.\"Ye Wu said excitedly.\n\n\n\nQin Dun's calm atmosphere was silent in front of Ye Gu, and made a somewhat funny expression, saying, \"Look at you! You are still so young, I am old. It's better to cultivate your energy! Magic is actually too easy to make you old. I remember, you are one year older than me.\"\n\n\n\nYe Wu said in a bad mood, \"What's the young man? You're almost turning white when you didn't look at my hair? Let's go into the house and say.\" As he said, he pulled Qin Shi and walked in, but he glanced at Mei Ying's side in the process.\n\n\n\nThe arrangement of the bamboo house is very simple, with bamboo couches, bamboo tables, bamboo chairs, and that's all.\n\n\n\n a href=\"http://www.cmfu.com\">Qidate Chinese Network Welcome to read the book friends.

Purely theoretical style...\n\n***\n\nYe Li picked up the water jug from the table, poured a cup of clear water, and handed it to Qin Shang, \"This is spring water from beneath my Azure Sky Sea, have a taste.\"\n\nQin Shang took it and drank a mouthful, praising, \"Clear and sweet, not bad. You certainly know how to enjoy yourself.\"\n\nYe Li sighed, \"We haven't seen each other for over twenty years, old fellow. You specially came to find me this time, so it's not for something, is it? You know, I've already washed my hands of Bamboo Sect matters; even if there's anything, it has nothing to do with me.\"\n\nQin Shang laughed heartily and said, \"I haven't said anything, and you've already completely washed your hands of it. What do you think I'm here for? This time, I'm not leaving.\"\n\nA hint of surprise appeared in Ye Li's eyes, \"Not leaving?\"\n\nQin Shang nodded and said, \"I've just returned from Falan.\"\n\nHearing the two words \"Falan,\" Ye Li's gaze changed instantly, and the expression on his face grew a little somber, \"You still went. So, you've already reached the Purple-level?\"\n\nQin Shang narrowed his eyes and scrutinized Ye Li, \"Aren't you the same? Let me see how you are?\"\n\nYe Li glared at him irritably, as a faint purple energy flow drifted out from within him—an aura of pride, a stubborn energy. The immense pressure made Qin Shang's eyes light up, \"Good, first stage, you're also first stage. It seems neither of us has fallen behind the other.\"\n\nYe Li said, \"I'm no longer your opponent. At the same level, in Longqinusu, there's no magic or Dou Qi that can defeat your zither magic. Do you think I don't know that?\"\n\nQin Shang smiled slightly and said, \"My zither pieces only reveal their true power after more than a third of the performance. At the same level, if you can't beat me, won't you run? And I can't do anything about you? Are you suggesting I should run after you?\"\n\nYe Li snarled, \"At this distance, believe it or not, I'll take you out in one go.\"\n\nQin Shang leisurely took another sip of the spring water, \"I don't believe it.\"\n\nThe two exchanged glances and couldn't help but burst into laughter. Neither Qin Shang nor Ye Li had been this happy for a long time.\n\nAs their laughter subsided, Ye Li soberly said, \"Old fellow, frankly, what's your impression of Falan?\"\n\nQin Shang's expression darkened, and he sighed, \"You don't need to ask further. The Seven Towers of Falan are beyond our imagination. When I cleared the Illusion Tower, I didn't even see the Tower Master.\"\n\nAfter hearing his words, Ye Li remained silent for a long time before saying somewhat mournfully, \"It seems we'll never have hope.\"\n\n\"No.\" Qin Shang's eyes lit up, as if he had thought of something exciting, and he abruptly stood up from the bamboo chair, \"There's absolutely hope. And, it's right before our eyes.\"\n\nA fiery gaze burst forth from Ye Li's eyes, \"What is it? Tell me quickly. Is there really hope to contend with the Seven Towers of Falan?\"\n\nQin Shang smiled slightly, sat back down, but said nothing.\n\nYe Li said impatiently, \"Why the suspense? Speak, or I'll resort to force.\"\n\nQin Shang chuckled, \"You still have your old temper, still so impatient. I really wonder how your Bamboo Dou Qi cultivated to its current realm. After I underwent the assessment in Falan, my Purple-level identity was confirmed, and I made it onto the Falan Rainbow Ranking List. Before leaving, the people of Falan asked me where I'd like to be stationed, and I chose Arcadian. Because you're here, that's why I came. As long as you agree, I can stay here for at least ten-odd years.\"\n\nYe Li's expression shifted, and he said somewhat suspiciously, \"Old fellow, why do I feel like you're setting a trap for me to walk into! If you have something to say, just say it directly. What exactly is our hope?\"\n\nQin Shang nodded and said, \"Alright, then I'll speak directly. Our hope is your grandson.\"\n\nYe Li was startled, \"You didn't make a mistake, did you? You came back with Ying'er, didn't you see that my grandson was born with only eight fingers? In the future, it'll even be difficult for him to hold a weapon firmly. How could he possibly become our hope? I just want this child to live a peaceful life.\"\n\nQin Shang pursed his lips and said, \"That's from your perspective, but from mine, it's completely different. Being born with eight fingers makes him the successor I've always dreamed of. Without the influence of the little finger restriction on both hands, it offers enormous benefits for zither practice. What's more, your grandson has an exceptionally keen perception of music by nature. As long as you let him learn zither from me, he will be our future hope. To be frank with you. The main reason I chose to come to Arcadian instead of other powerful nations is because you are here. You also know that once our cultivation reaches the Purple-level, further progress becomes extremely difficult. Moreover, as Divine Musicians, cultivating to the Purple-level, while allowing us to cast powerful zither magic, also has very significant drawbacks. Therefore, I've thought of a good method to solve this. And this method requires your cooperation.\"\n\nYe Li frowned slightly and said, \"My cooperation? I practice Bamboo Sect Dou Qi, how can I cooperate with you?\"\n\nQin Shang said, \"In Longqinusu, there's only a precedent for magic complementing Dou Qi, which is the so-called dual cultivation of magic and martial arts, but no one has been able to surpass the Blue-level. Nowadays, mages disdain to distract themselves by cultivating Dou Qi. The method I've conceived, however, uses Dou Qi to enhance zither magic, using Dou Qi to expand the range of sound waves, and even directly propel sound waves to launch attacks. Only Divine Musicians have the possibility of cultivating in this way. And your Bamboo Dou Qi, full of natural aura, is the most perfect Dou Qi to complement zither music. I originally came here to take on a disciple, and then persuade you to teach him Bamboo Dou Qi, combining the strengths of our two families to create a super Divine Musician, who might even break through the Purple-level limitations. But as soon as I arrived here, before I even had a chance to settle down and look for a disciple, I saw your daughter-in-law and grandson. Born with eight fingers! It's rare in the world; I absolutely won't let go of such a good opportunity. Old fellow, I've never begged anyone in my life; this time, I'm making an exception. I implore you, let your grandson become my disciple.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Qin Shang stood up and bowed deeply to Ye Li, his expression extremely solemn.\n\nYe Li dodged to the side and said resolutely, \"No, I don't agree. I only have this one grandson. Although he was born with eight fingers, I still hope for him to inherit my mantle.\"\n\nQin Shang said eagerly, \"Didn't you just say you wanted him to be an ordinary person? Why are you changing your mind now?\"\n\nYe Li said, \"An ordinary person, I meant an ordinary person of my Bamboo Sect. My grandson is the future Young Sect Master of the Bamboo Sect. If you lure him away to the Zither Sect, what will become of my Bamboo Sect? No way, no way.\"\n\nQin Shang said unwillingly, \"Ye Zhong and Mei Ying are both still young; are you really afraid you won't have more grandsons later? And someone born with eight fingers is a rarity, not even one in a million. Old fellow, for the sake of our many years of friendship, please grant my wish.\"\n\nYe Li gave a bitter smile and said, \"It's not that I don't want to grant your wish, it's that I truly cannot. Yes, Zhong'er and Ying'er are still young, but they can only have this one son in their lifetime. Back then, Ying'er had a difficult birth when she delivered my precious grandson. You should have noticed; Ying'er is the daughter of that old Plum Blossom from the Plum Sect. Old Plum Blossom and I invited Old Lady Lan Qing to personally deliver her. Fortunately, with Lan Qing there, mother and child were safe, but Lan Qing also said that Ying'er would not be able to bear children again in the future. If you don't believe me, you can inquire at the Orchid Sect.\"\n\nHearing Ye Li's words, Qin Shang couldn't help but slump dejectedly onto the bamboo chair. The feeling of all his hopes turning to naught was absolutely unpleasant. For a long time, neither he nor Ye Li spoke, both sinking into deep thought. Just then, a clear and melodious voice sounded from outside the door, \"Dad, I heard we have guests.\"\n\n---\n\n[1] \"Essence-Boosting Event\" and \"snatch essence\" refer to an in-novel ranking or competition system common in online fiction, where readers' votes or engagement contribute to a chapter or story's \"essence\" points, often leading to rewards or higher visibility.",
